In a deal with special counsel Robert Mueller , Cohen admitted he misled lawmakers last year when he told them his attempts on behalf of the Trump Organization to build a Trump Tower in Russia ended in January 2016 and that he never talked about having Mr. Trump travel to Moscow .
In court documents filed Thursday , though , Cohen said his efforts on what was known as the “ Moscow project ” lasted at least until June 2016 , he planned a Moscow trip for himself and was working on one for Mr. Trump for later that year , possibly after Mr. Trump claimed the Republican presidential nomination at the party ’ s national convention .
Cohen ’ s new version of events would show Mr. Trump actively pursuing a business deal with Russia during an election in which Moscow has been accused of unprecedented meddling .
“ I made these statements to be consistent with Individual-1 ’ s political messaging and to be loyal to Individual-1 , ” Cohen said in court . Based on comparing his previous public statements to the court documents , it ’ s clear “ Individual 1 ” is Mr. Trump .
Speaking to reporters after the plea , Mr. Trump called Cohen “ a weak person and not a very smart person . ”
The president said he canceled the Russia project , but even if it had gone forward , it would have been legal to run a business while campaigning for president .
“ What he ’ s trying to do is get a reduced sentence , so he ’ s lying about a project that everybody knew about , ” Mr. Trump said .
Democrats said the guilty plea tightened the net around Mr. Trump , whose personal attorney , campaign chairman and national security adviser all have pleaded guilty to charges brought by Mr. Mueller .
Cohen , who pleaded guilty in a federal courtroom in Manhattan , agreed with federal prosecutors ’ statements that he had a 20-minute conversation with a spokesman for the Kremlin about Trump business . As late as June 2016 , Cohen discussed the project with a Russian-born businessman , Felix Sater , identified as “ individual-2 ” in court documents . The two communicated extensively about plans for Cohen ’ s trip to Russia , which never came to fruition .
The plea deal is Cohen ’ s second in two months . In August , he pleaded guilty in the Southern District of New York to making illegal campaign contributions by paying hush money to porn actress Stormy Daniels and Playboy centerfold Karen McDougal .
Both women have said they had affairs with Mr. Trump , which the president denies , though he has acknowledged the payments were made .
Cohen , who once declared that he would “ take a bullet ” for Mr. Trump , has been cooperating with the Mueller investigation .
He has reportedly spent more than 70 hours with prosecutors answering questions about contacts between Russia and Trump campaign officials during the presidential campaign . Cohen also has spoken to Mr. Mueller ’ s team about Mr. Trump ’ s business ties to Russia and possible pardons , ABC News reported .
Cohen served as Mr. Trump ’ s personal fixer for more than a decade , working with the real estate mogul-turned-president on highly sensitive personal and business matters .
Solomon Wisenberg , a Washington lawyer who served as independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr ’ s deputy during investigations into President Bill Clinton , said he doesn ’ t view the details disclosed Thursday as particularly dangerous to Mr. Trump .
“ In terms of criminal liability , the special counsel would have to show that Trump knew of and approved Cohen writing a false letter to Congress , ” he said .
Mr. Wisenberg said a presidential candidate conducting business with a foreign government may be good fodder for pundits but is not illegal . It is likely not going to be a political liability for the president , he said , noting that Mr. Trump this week did not dismiss the idea of pardoning his now-convicted former campaign chairman , Paul Manafort .
“ Add this to the list of stuff that would be devastating , historically , to any other candidate but doesn ’ t seem to affect Trump , ” he said .
Jacob S. Frenkel , a former federal prosecutor in New Orleans and now a Washington white-collar defense lawyer , said Mr. Mueller ’ s team may know much more than what is contained in the Cohen deal .
“ I think to suggest that a narrow plea agreement means that is all that occurred gives a false sense of security or interpretation , ” he said . “ By its very nature , a plea deal reflects a set of parameters in this type of an investigation that enables the prosecutor to add another puzzle piece to the story yet still keep substantive evidence close to the vest . ”
Mr. Frenkel said Mr. Trump ’ s defense of running of his business while a presidential candidate may be good public relations but doesn ’ t amount to much of a legal argument if it comes to that .

Last week 's briefing , led by election security official Shelby Pierson and first reported by The New York Times , addressed the overall picture of Russia 's efforts , including hacking , weaponizing social media and attacks on election infrastructure , one of the sources said .
The briefers said Russia does favor Trump , but that helping Trump was n't the only thing they were trying to do as it was also designed to raise questions about the integrity of the elections process , the source added .
Trump became irate in a meeting with outgoing acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire last week for allowing the information about Russia 's meddling efforts to be included in the briefing , a White House official said .
Russia 's interference in the 2016 election -- which the US intelligence community believes was aimed at boosting Trump 's candidacy and hurting his opponent , Hillary Clinton -- led to special counsel Robert Mueller 's investigation . The prospect of interference in 2020 will further test US defenses against foreign meddling , which Trump has repeatedly downplayed as he has dismissed any suggestion that Kremlin influence played a role in his election .
A national security official in the Trump administration told CNN that Pierson may have mischaracterized the intelligence that Russia has developed a preference for Trump .
`` A more reasonable interpretation of the intelligence is not that they have a preference , it 's a step short of that . It 's more that they understand the President is someone they can work with , he 's a dealmaker . But not that they prefer him over ( Bernie ) Sanders or ( Pete ) Buttigieg or anyone else . So it may have been mischaracterized by Shelby , '' the official said .
James Clapper , who served as director of national intelligence under President Barack Obama , told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer on `` The Situation Room '' Thursday evening that it is `` quite predictable '' Russia would again try to interfere in the election .
`` This is not a big surprise , but it illustrates the tremendous challenge that the intelligence community has where they 're teeing up facts that our President does n't want to hear , and with a result that the messenger got shot in the form of Joe Maguire being asked to leave , '' Clapper said .

News of Pierson 's classified briefing to lawmakers on Russia was not well received by either Trump or House Republicans who were present , sources tell CNN . When Trump learned of it , he seemed most frustrated that House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff , a Democrat who has been a prominent critic , was included in the briefing , according to a person familiar with the matter .
Trump believed that Schiff in particular would use the information to try and undermine him over the coming months as he runs for reelection , the person said , and Trump blamed Maguire for the information getting to Schiff .
Schiff , a California Democrat , tweeted Thursday night that if Trump is interfering with intelligence reports to Congress about threats of foreign interference , `` he is again jeopardizing our efforts to stop foreign meddling . Exactly as we warned he would do . ''
The national security official , however , said Trump was upset that he heard about the intelligence conclusion from a member of Congress rather than from the intelligence community , describing Trump as `` out of joint with Maguire on that process . ''
A former senior intelligence official dismissed the notion that Pierson would have shown preferential treatment for Schiff and the Democrats in her briefing on election security , instead suggesting that Trump 's response indicates that he and the intelligence community `` are still unable to communicate on this topic . ''
`` What the ( intelligence community ) sees as reporting the truth -- simple statement of facts in evidence without judgment -- the President sees as undermining his legitimacy , '' the former official told CNN .
On Wednesday , Trump announced he was naming Richard Grenell , a staunch loyalist and current US ambassador to Germany , as acting DNI despite him not having experience in intelligence . A source familiar with internal discussions said White House officials saw Grenell as a good stopgap solution for the acting DNI vacancy as time was running out on Maguire 's time in the position and because of Trump 's dissatisfaction with Maguire due to the intelligence briefing .
Trump confirmed in a tweet Thursday night he plans to nominate a permanent DNI soon , and floated Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia , the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee and a top congressional ally , for the position when speaking to reporters on Air Force One .
Grenell was already being considered for other White House positions when filling the DNI position became a pressing need , the source said .
Thursday night , an intelligence official confirmed to CNN that the second-ranking official at DNI , Andrew Hallman , is also leaving his acting position . Joining DNI as a temporary senior adviser to Grenell is Kash Patel , a former acolyte of Rep. Devin Nunes of California , the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee , three sources told CNN . Patel was key in crafting the controversial Republican House Intelligence Committee memo that accused FBI and Justice Department officials of abusing their surveillance authority .
Trump has repeatedly downplayed Russia 's efforts to interfere in US elections and has dismissed findings by US intelligence agencies .
Most notably , the President appeared to side with Russia 's assurances rather than his intelligence community 's assessment of Russian meddling in the 2016 election when he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki , Finland , in July 2018
`` I have great confidence in my intelligence people , but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today , '' Trump told reporters as he stood alongside the Russian leader . He later claimed to have misspoken .
Since then , US intelligence officials have continued to consistently warn about Russia 's ongoing efforts to interfere in American elections , noting threats to both the 2018 midterms and the 2020 presidential race . Last month , FBI Director Christopher Wray told the Senate Judiciary Committee that Russia was continuing to `` engage in malign foreign influence '' online with the goal of sowing division and discord , `` and to generate controversy , to generate distrust in our democratic institutions in our electoral process . ''
At the time , Wray said he could n't publicly answer a question about whether the Russians were aiming to help or hurt particular political campaigns .
Pierson herself has been out in front on the issue of foreign interference in the 2020 election as top officials have sought to raise awareness about the nature of the threat that caught most of the American public off guard in 2016 .
`` The Russians , for example , are already engaging in influence operations relative to candidates going into 2020 . But we do not have evidence at this time that our adversaries are directly looking at interfering with vote counts or the vote tallies , '' she told NPR in an interview last month .
On the day he was replaced , Maguire penned an op-ed along with other top election security officials , including Wray and Attorney General William Barr , issuing a similar warning about Russia and other foreign actors .

The Border Patrol has called that type of fencing a “wall” for the last couple of years, and Mr. Trump in recent months has adopted that stance as well, saying the bollard-style fencing is, in fact, his wall.

Congressional hearings were created to educate lawmakers so they have knowledge before they pass bills or impeach a president.

Not today. Today, hardly any education happens.

During the President Trump impeachment ""testimony,"" legislators tried to score points. At least five times, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., shut down criticism by shouting, ""Gentleman is not recognized!""

I get that politicians are eager for ""face time"" in front of a larger audience, but I assumed they would at least try to learn things. Nope.

Maybe they don't want to ask real questions because they fear looking as dumb as then-Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, did at a hearing on Facebook. He asked Mark Zuckerberg, ""How do you sustain a business model in which users don't pay for your service?""

""We run ads,"" smirked Zuckerberg. ""I see,"" said Hatch.

What's obvious to most people somehow eludes the oblivious ""experts"" in Congress.

At another Facebook hearing, Congress grilled Zuckerberg about his plan to launch an electronic currency called Libra. Zuckerberg said, ""I actually don't know if Libra is going to work, but I believe it's important to try new things.""

He was right. But instead of asking about technological or economic implications of the idea, Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, asked Zuckerberg, of the companies partnering with him, ""how many are headed by women?""

""Congressman, I do not know the answer,"" replied Zuckerberg.

""How many of them are minorities?"" asked Green. ""Are there any members of the LGBTQ+ community?""

Green doesn't want to learn anything. He wants to sneer and score points.

Politicians' sloppy ignorance is extraordinary. Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, grilled Google CEO Sundar Pichai about iPhones, citing a story about his granddaughter using one, leading Pichai to explain, ""Congressman, iPhone is made by a different company.""

Today's posturing is not what the founders had in mind when they invented hearings in 1789.

George Mason said members of Congress ""possess inquisitorial powers"" to ""inspect the Conduct of public offices.""

Yes! Investigate government.

But today, they are more likely to threaten CEOs and bully opponents.

""Are you stupid?"" then-Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., said to one witness. They want to showboat, not learn. Often, they ask questions even when they know the answers.

""Ms. DeVos, have you ever taken out a student loan?"" asked Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. ""Have any of your children had to borrow money?""

""We weren't,"" replied Sloan.

Some of today's hearings are useful in that we get to see how absurd and ignorant our representatives can be.

On Tuesday morning , the president will head to Capitol Hill in an attempt to seal up House Republican support for the health insurance legislation , just two days before the most important congressional vote of his young presidency .
“ He ’ s been working . He ’ s the closer , ” House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden ( R-Ore. ) said Monday on MSNBC . “ He knows how to put this together . He ’ s got great negotiating skills , and we ’ re coming together with it . ”

“ He ’ s the one who has helped negotiate changes to this bill with members from all over our caucus , ” Ryan said on “ Fox New Sunday. ” “ We have a president who is rolling up his sleeves . ... He ’ s a very quick learner on healthcare . ”
“ He ’ s a business guy who came to the presidency , ” Ryan continued , “ and now he ’ s helping us make sure that we bridge differences with members who are bringing constructive ideas and solutions for how to make this bill better . ”
Trump ’ s increased involvement in the healthcare effort comes as Ryan and other GOP leaders furiously work behind the scenes to tweak the plan to boost its support .
On Monday night , Ryan ’ s team unveiled a package of changes to the bill , known as a manager ’ s amendment , that included two changes to Medicaid that Trump had negotiated last week with the conservative Republican Study Committee ( RSC ) .
The amendment also included a narrowly tailored provision — negotiated by White House senior staffers , GOP leaders and New York Republicans — that seeks to stop the Empire State from forcing counties to pay for part of Medicaid . The provision , authored by Rep. Chris Collins ( R-N.Y. ) , is expected to win support from several vulnerable centrist New York Republicans , including Rep. Claudia Tenney ( R-N.Y. ) .
“ The Trump administration knows how important this is to many members of the New York GOP delegation , ” said a GOP aide familiar with the New York provision .
███ ’ s Whip List shows that 17 House Republicans currently plan to vote no on the healthcare legislation , suggesting the final vote tally will be a nail-biter . Ryan and his team can only afford 21 GOP defections if all Democrats vote no , as they are expected to do .
GOP leadership aides declined to share their internal whip count but said they are picking up votes daily and “ feel very good about where we are and how our conversations are going . ”
In an email to his vote-counting team over the weekend , Majority Whip Steve Scalise ( R-La . ) attempted to frame Thursday ’ s healthcare vote as perhaps the most consequential of their congressional careers . The legislation , he argued , might be viewed as more important than welfare-reform legislation that was passed by Congress more than 20 years ago .
“ This is our moment to make history , ” Scalise wrote to his team .
Ryan , striking an optimistic tone , said House Republicans are “ on track ” and “ right where we want to be . ”
If the legislation manages to clear the House , it will have a much tougher road in the Senate , where moderate and conservative Republicans are clashing over what should happen to the Medicaid expansion component of ObamaCare .
With a slim majority , Republicans can only afford to lose two votes in the Senate to pass the bill , and four have already said they can ’ t support it in its current form , according to ███ ’ s Whip List .
Trump ’ s decision to take a more hands-on role in the process is bearing fruit . He met with members of the RSC in the Oval Office late last week and offered small changes to the plan in exchange for their votes on the floor .
Those changes include giving states the option to impose a Medicaid work requirement and flexibility in how they get funding from the federal government .
Eight Republicans that attended the meeting and had opposed the bill , or said they were leaning against it , pledged their votes on the spot .
Rep. Gary Palmer ( R-Ala. ) , who voted against the bill in the Budget Committee last week , and Rep. Robert Aderholt Robert Brown AderholtBottom Line Lobbying World House advances B agriculture bill MORE ( R-Ala. ) jumped on board , as did Rep. Mark Walker ( R-N.C. ) , chairman of the 172-member RSC who just weeks earlier had issued a statement critical of the bill .
“ The president asked us specifically would we support him on this American Health Care Act ” if the changes were made , Walker told reporters after his White House meeting .
Most members of the far-right House Freedom Caucus and their Senate allies still remain opposed to the bill . But some took it as a positive sign that conservative leaders continued to negotiate with the White House over the weekend .

Trump was not present , but the meeting lasted for three hours .
The conservatives made their case for a repeal of ObamaCare ’ s regulations and insurance mandates , sources said , but those changes would likely chase away moderates and make it difficult to pass the bill through the Senate .

“He’s the one who has helped negotiate changes to this bill with members from all over our caucus,” Ryan said on “Fox New Sunday.” “We have a president who is rolling up his sleeves. ... He’s a very quick learner on healthcare.”

“He’s a business guy who came to the presidency,” Ryan continued, “and now he’s helping us make sure that we bridge differences with members who are bringing constructive ideas and solutions for how to make this bill better.”

Trump’s increased involvement in the healthcare effort comes as Ryan and other GOP leaders furiously work behind the scenes to tweak the plan to boost its support.

On Monday night, Ryan’s team unveiled a package of changes to the bill, known as a manager’s amendment, that included two changes to Medicaid that Trump had negotiated last week with the conservative Republican Study Committee (RSC).

The amendment also included a narrowly tailored provision — negotiated by White House senior staffers, GOP leaders and New York Republicans — that seeks to stop the Empire State from forcing counties to pay for part of Medicaid. The provision, authored by Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), is expected to win support from several vulnerable centrist New York Republicans, including Rep. Claudia Tenney (R-N.Y.).

“The Trump administration knows how important this is to many members of the New York GOP delegation,” said a GOP aide familiar with the New York provision.

The Hill’s Whip List shows that 17 House Republicans currently plan to vote no on the healthcare legislation, suggesting the final vote tally will be a nail-biter. Ryan and his team can only afford 21 GOP defections if all Democrats vote no, as they are expected to do.

GOP leadership aides declined to share their internal whip count but said they are picking up votes daily and “feel very good about where we are and how our conversations are going.”

In an email to his vote-counting team over the weekend, Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) attempted to frame Thursday’s healthcare vote as perhaps the most consequential of their congressional careers. The legislation, he argued, might be viewed as more important than welfare-reform legislation that was passed by Congress more than 20 years ago.

“This is our moment to make history,” Scalise wrote to his team.

Ryan, striking an optimistic tone, said House Republicans are “on track” and “right where we want to be.”

If the legislation manages to clear the House, it will have a much tougher road in the Senate, where moderate and conservative Republicans are clashing over what should happen to the Medicaid expansion component of ObamaCare.

With a slim majority, Republicans can only afford to lose two votes in the Senate to pass the bill, and four have already said they can’t support it in its current form, according to The Hill’s Whip List.

Trump’s decision to take a more hands-on role in the process is bearing fruit. He met with members of the RSC in the Oval Office late last week and offered small changes to the plan in exchange for their votes on the floor.

Those changes include giving states the option to impose a Medicaid work requirement and flexibility in how they get funding from the federal government.

Eight Republicans that attended the meeting and had opposed the bill, or said they were leaning against it, pledged their votes on the spot.

Rep. Gary Palmer (R-Ala.), who voted against the bill in the Budget Committee last week, and Rep. Robert Aderholt Robert Brown AderholtBottom Line Lobbying World House advances B agriculture bill MORE (R-Ala.) jumped on board, as did Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.), chairman of the 172-member RSC who just weeks earlier had issued a statement critical of the bill.

“The president asked us specifically would we support him on this American Health Care Act” if the changes were made, Walker told reporters after his White House meeting.

“We all agreed, to a man.”

Most members of the far-right House Freedom Caucus and their Senate allies still remain opposed to the bill. But some took it as a positive sign that conservative leaders continued to negotiate with the White House over the weekend.

Trump was not present, but the meeting lasted for three hours.

The conservatives made their case for a repeal of ObamaCare’s regulations and insurance mandates, sources said, but those changes would likely chase away moderates and make it difficult to pass the bill through the Senate.

Meadows and other conservative members emerged from a Freedom Caucus meeting late Monday night and insisted the bill would not pass without more significant changes.

us_congress,Guest Writer - Right,2,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/jan/15/democrats-decree-death-in-the-swamp-for-the-dreame/,OPINION: Democrats decree death in the swamp for the Dreamers,2018-01-15,Wesley Pruden,"Chuck Schumer , Nancy Pelosi and their Democratic followers laid a careful trap for their Republican tormentors , and then fell in it . The Republican leadership can keep them from climbing out if they ’ re smart and show a little courage .
Determined not to recognize the results of the 2016 election , as if they were the losers of an election in a third-world backwater , the losers set out to put their candidate on the throne by “ any means necessary. ” The Democrats established not the usual loyal opposition , but a “ resistance. ” A resistance does not try to make a government work , but to thwart it by fair means or foul .
The resistance has not stopped the Trump administration dead in its advance , but erected speed bumps to slow everything down . They ’ re counting on this to persuade voters that they might as well elect Democrats because even if Democrats can ’ t elect a president they can render an administration powerless , impotent and dead in the swamp .
That ’ s why the Democrats have not , as loyal oppositions generally do , offered alternatives to Republican initiatives . It hasn ’ t worked , but the party has stuck to it because it has nothing else to offer but the bitter fruit of the no-no tree .
The Democratic strategy was to prevent passage of the Republican tax-cut legislation . They lost , if only by a single vote in the Senate , but the modern Democrats have become inordinately fond of moral victories , so they applaud themselves , anyway .
“ But it didn ’ t have to be that way , ” writes Fred Barnes in the Weekly Standard . “ Had Democrats negotiated with Republicans they might have saved the provision they most wanted to preserve , the full deductibility of state and local taxes . It ’ s a crucial [ tax ] break in rich , high-tax states like New York , New Jersey and California . ”
But the Democratic strategy admits of no compromise , ever , on anything . Mr. Schumer and Miss Pelosi are proud of the fact that no Democrats urged compromise , which if they had they might have saved several tax breaks dear to the hearts ( and pockets ) of rich donors to Democratic campaigns . The Wall Street Journal suggests that a co-operative Democratic leadership might have traded support for a carbon tax , which Democrats have sought for years , for eliminating the business tax . But compromise can not be when the strategy calls for give-no-quarter opposition to everything Donald Trump proposes . The only thing this cutting off of many noses accomplishes is a lot of faces without noses , and a lot of bloody noses underfoot .
The Democrats dare not propose anything to help business lest it offend its base , which has no interest in making the economy grow , but wants only to redistribute whatever wealth comes along . An honorable compromise might have prevented the deep cut in the corporate tax rate , from 35 percent to 21 percent .

Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi and their Democratic followers laid a careful trap for their Republican tormentors, and then fell in it. The Republican leadership can keep them from climbing out if they’re smart and show a little courage.

Determined not to recognize the results of the 2016 election, as if they were the losers of an election in a third-world backwater, the losers set out to put their candidate on the throne by “any means necessary.” The Democrats established not the usual loyal opposition, but a “resistance.” A resistance does not try to make a government work, but to thwart it by fair means or foul.

The resistance has not stopped the Trump administration dead in its advance, but erected speed bumps to slow everything down. They’re counting on this to persuade voters that they might as well elect Democrats because even if Democrats can’t elect a president they can render an administration powerless, impotent and dead in the swamp.

That’s why the Democrats have not, as loyal oppositions generally do, offered alternatives to Republican initiatives. It hasn’t worked, but the party has stuck to it because it has nothing else to offer but the bitter fruit of the no-no tree.

The Democratic strategy was to prevent passage of the Republican tax-cut legislation. They lost, if only by a single vote in the Senate, but the modern Democrats have become inordinately fond of moral victories, so they applaud themselves, anyway.

“But it didn’t have to be that way,” writes Fred Barnes in the Weekly Standard. “Had Democrats negotiated with Republicans they might have saved the provision they most wanted to preserve, the full deductibility of state and local taxes. It’s a crucial [tax] break in rich, high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and California.”

But the Democratic strategy admits of no compromise, ever, on anything. Mr. Schumer and Miss Pelosi are proud of the fact that no Democrats urged compromise, which if they had they might have saved several tax breaks dear to the hearts (and pockets) of rich donors to Democratic campaigns. The Wall Street Journal suggests that a co-operative Democratic leadership might have traded support for a carbon tax, which Democrats have sought for years, for eliminating the business tax. But compromise cannot be when the strategy calls for give-no-quarter opposition to everything Donald Trump proposes. The only thing this cutting off of many noses accomplishes is a lot of faces without noses, and a lot of bloody noses underfoot.

The Democrats dare not propose anything to help business lest it offend its base, which has no interest in making the economy grow, but wants only to redistribute whatever wealth comes along. An honorable compromise might have prevented the deep cut in the corporate tax rate, from 35 percent to 21 percent. But that’s what the president and his party wanted, so who needs a nose, after all, as long as there’s a working mouth.

The president’s party, which had failed to deliver its much-promised repeal of Obamacare, even achieved the mortal wounding of Obamacare, since the successful tax bill eliminated the requirement that everyone had to buy health insurance or pay a fine. Barack Obama and the Democrats of his day argued that such a requirement was necessary or the Obamacare scheme would wither and die. Many economists said they were probably right. Now the buy-or-else requirement is gone, with Obamacare left to wither without mourning. The tax bill even opens the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling, which Democrats had opposed for years and years.

But it’s the cynicism in the debate over DACA, abandoning the so-called Dreamers, the children born to parents who came here illegally, that takes the breath. Everybody, beginning with the president, is sympathetic to the plight of the Dreamers, who were never guilty of breaking the law themselves. No one asks to be born, or determines where. Mr. Trump has demonstrated his willingness on several occasions to find a way to save them. The Democrats, not so much.

“We are ready, willing and able to make a deal on DACA — the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals — but I don’t think the Democrats want to make a deal,” the president said Sunday night. “The folks from DACA should know the Democrats are the ones who aren’t going to make a deal.”

In fact, even as the U.S. Homeland Security Agency has started accepting applications for extensions, as ordered by the courts pending final adjudication of the legislation. Even that’s not good enough for the Democrats. They insist on a permanent solution now, and if this inconveniences the Dreamers, that’s just too bad.

Elections have consequences, and the Democrats, who did a little dreaming of their own about Hillary Clinton, just can’t understand why they can’t have it their way, anyway.

But the glide path to avoiding a shutdown this week sets up an even bigger clash in December, when lawmakers have to agree on a new funding bill for the new fiscal year. Democrats at both ends of the Capitol, as well as in the White House, will demand raising the current caps for domestic spending. But hawkish Republicans have long insisted on boosting cash for defense programs, while fiscal conservatives will abhor any additional spending overall.

The outcome of that funding fight is far from certain. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said she had no agreement with Boehner in his twilight weeks beyond a short-term funding bill this week.

When asked Sunday during CBS’ “Face the Nation” whether the government will shut down, Boehner replied: “No.”

Boehner acknowledged he’ll have to tap Democratic support for the bill but added: “I expect my Democrat colleagues want to keep the government open as much as I do.”

The House has passed a stopgap spending bill that would keep the government open through Dec. 15. It passed almost entirely along party lines: In addition to funding the government, it calls for defunding of the Affordable Care Act.

The White House has said President Obama would veto the bill, were it to come to his desk in this form. And it most likely won't. Democrats, who control the Senate, won't pass a bill that defunds Obamacare.

Which raises the question, now what?

Friday's vote was designed to project unity. House Republicans went straight from voting to approve the bill to an indoor rally in a neighboring room in the Capitol.

""The American people don't want the government shut down, and they don't want Obamacare,"" House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said at the event, declaring victory with a panorama of House Republicans standing behind him and cheering.

But that joy isn't likely to last. Senate Democrats intend to strip the Obamacare language out of the bill and send it back to the House. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, says he'll take a stand and try to stop them — but the numbers, and Senate procedure, aren't on his side.

Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., is convinced Democrats will win this one.

""I have never seen such an extreme group of people adopt such an insane policy,"" he says. ""There's a time and a place for everything, and Americans know they're way overreaching.""

In all likelihood, sometime late next week, the House will have to decide between a government shutdown and a stopgap spending bill that funds Obamacare, right along with the rest of government operations. But when asked about this prospect, House Republicans mostly deferred, saying they wouldn't want to speculate about what the Senate might do.

Rep. Rob Woodall, R-Ga., says House Republicans won't let the Senate jam them.

""I want you to interview everybody in this hallway, and I want you to see who believes that what the Senate sends back is what we get stuck with,"" he says. ""I don't know who those people are but they don't sit in the conference meetings I sit in.""

There won't be a lot of time for versions of the spending bill to ping-pong back and forth between the House and Senate. Without congressional action, the government will shut down on Oct. 1. Obama laid out the stakes Friday in a speech at a Ford plant in Missouri.

""This is not abstract,"" he said. ""Hundreds of thousands of Americans will not be allowed to go to work. Our men and women in uniform, even those overseas, won't get their paychecks on time. Small businesses, they won't get their loans processed.""

Here's what we do know:

That might seem glib -- but it's also the truth.

Any new package would not only have its own new set of detractors and doubters but also would face a real time crunch to simply pass it through the House and the Senate before midnight.

And a big chunk of it is politics.

Democrats are not in the compromising mood for a few reasons. One is that this is their one piece of leverage in Washington right now, and they want to use it to protect the DACA recipients.

Sen. Tom Carper had been wavering over the “ nuclear option ” for days — until one of his colleagues issued a blunt judgment of Congress .
“ My colleague said , ‘ It ’ s hard to imagine it getting much worse because we ’ re not getting anything done , ’ ” the veteran Delaware Democrat said . “ If there was an a-ha moment , that was probably it . ”
Indeed , the 113th Congress is on track to go down as the least productive in history — a legacy that may be cemented after Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid gutted the filibuster on presidential nominees by deploying the “ nuclear option. ” Republicans say the unprecedented move will make them even less likely to cooperate with Democrats — not that there ’ s much collaboration to begin with .
So far , this Congress has only enacted 49 laws , the fewest since at least 1947 , when the Congressional Record began tallying legislative activity on a yearly basis . In fact , the 80th Congress — famously dubbed the “ do nothing ” Congress by President Harry Truman — enacted 388 public laws by July 1947 .
In the last 66 years , there are just four occasions in which fewer than 100 laws were enacted by a similar point in the legislative calendar . And two of those instances were in the last two Congresses , with the previous Congress making just 62 laws through November 2011 .
The dysfunction is partially the result of the toxic relationship between President Barack Obama and congressional Republicans , which helped trigger the first government shutdown in 17 years last month and a series of flirtations with a historic debt default .
( ███ 's Turn the Table : Senate catching up with times on 'nuclear option ' )
The slow pace of legislating comes despite huge problems facing Washington : A $ 17 trillion debt , the prospects of a second government shutdown in mid-January , the bumpy rollout of the health care law and overseas threats from places like Iran . Meanwhile , congressional inaction on a new farm bill is poised to upend rural America and send milk prices soaring . Even legislation that would seem to appeal to some in both parties — like an immigration overhaul — is stuck .
Both sides are embarrassed by their performance , even if they are quick to assign blame to the other .
“ If I look at the last 12 weeks , we can count on one hand what we ’ ve achieved , ” said Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin ( D-Ill. ) . “ We put the government back in business thank goodness , but beyond that the strategic helium reserve bill is really the centerpiece of what we ’ ve done . ”
There is still a glimmer of hope to get some major bills through , including the long-overdue overhaul of farm policies , the annual defense policy bill , the comprehensive immigration bill , a budget deal and an omnibus spending package .

Sen. Tom Carper had been wavering over the “nuclear option” for days — until one of his colleagues issued a blunt judgment of Congress.

“My colleague said, ‘It’s hard to imagine it getting much worse because we’re not getting anything done,’” the veteran Delaware Democrat said. “If there was an a-ha moment, that was probably it.”

Indeed, the 113th Congress is on track to go down as the least productive in history — a legacy that may be cemented after Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid gutted the filibuster on presidential nominees by deploying the “nuclear option.” Republicans say the unprecedented move will make them even less likely to cooperate with Democrats — not that there’s much collaboration to begin with.

( Also on POLITICO: In post-nuclear landscape, uncharted terrain)

So far, this Congress has only enacted 49 laws, the fewest since at least 1947, when the Congressional Record began tallying legislative activity on a yearly basis. In fact, the 80th Congress — famously dubbed the “do nothing” Congress by President Harry Truman — enacted 388 public laws by July 1947.

In the last 66 years, there are just four occasions in which fewer than 100 laws were enacted by a similar point in the legislative calendar. And two of those instances were in the last two Congresses, with the previous Congress making just 62 laws through November 2011.

The dysfunction is partially the result of the toxic relationship between President Barack Obama and congressional Republicans, which helped trigger the first government shutdown in 17 years last month and a series of flirtations with a historic debt default.

( POLITICO's Turn the Table: Senate catching up with times on 'nuclear option')

The slow pace of legislating comes despite huge problems facing Washington: A $17 trillion debt, the prospects of a second government shutdown in mid-January, the bumpy rollout of the health care law and overseas threats from places like Iran. Meanwhile, congressional inaction on a new farm bill is poised to upend rural America and send milk prices soaring. Even legislation that would seem to appeal to some in both parties — like an immigration overhaul — is stuck.

Both sides are embarrassed by their performance, even if they are quick to assign blame to the other.

“If I look at the last 12 weeks, we can count on one hand what we’ve achieved,” said Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.). “We put the government back in business thank goodness, but beyond that the strategic helium reserve bill is really the centerpiece of what we’ve done.”

( Also on POLITICO: Obstructionism vs. Obamacare)

There is still a glimmer of hope to get some major bills through, including the long-overdue overhaul of farm policies, the annual defense policy bill, the comprehensive immigration bill, a budget deal and an omnibus spending package. And some bills have made it to the president’s desk, including a reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act and a measure addressing student loan rates.

But the farm bill’s chances for passage this year took a big hit this week, the emotional politics of an immigration overhaul may kill it next year and any budget deal is expected to be limited in scope.

Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) warned that the defense bill could join the long list of proposals that fail in the 113th Congress — even though an annual Pentagon authorization measure has passed Congress every year for the last 51 years.

( Also on POLITICO: Harry Reid's gambit)

“I do not know if it will be done,” McCain said. “I know [the nuclear option] puts a chill on the entire United States Senate.”

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), McCain’s closest friend in the Senate, added Thursday: “I just think after today, legislating’s going to be pretty tough.”

Not that it wasn’t already.

Part of the problem is structural. The schedules of the GOP-controlled House and Democratic-led Senate aren’t well coordinated, which can make efforts at bicameral meetings and consensus-building sessions more difficult. On Friday, the Senate began a two-week recess, while the House is expected to be out for just one week before adjourning for the year on Dec. 13. The Senate barely works on Fridays. In 2013, the Senate has been in session for legislative business on just seven Fridays.

The idea is splintering black activists and some prominent progressive lawmakers from Biden and top congressional Democrats while providing fodder for national Republicans , who are quickly mobilizing to use it as the latest example of Democrats moving to the left in the lead up to November .
A spokesman for Biden 's campaign said Monday that the former vice president `` hears and shares the deep grief and frustration '' of those calling for reform , but that he `` does not believe that police should be defunded . ”
Later , Biden made his position clear in an interview with CBS .
`` No , I do n't support defunding the police . I support conditioning federal aid to police based on whether or not they meet certain basic standards of decency and honorableness , '' he said .
Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill were adopting a similar position .

Asked if the slogan of defunding the police was “ politically problematic , ” Bass said that she supported the “ intent ” behind it , including more investment in communities , but “ I think it can be used as a distraction and that ’ s my concern . ”
Bass and other Democrats on Monday offered a sweeping package of reforms they hope will build pressure on the GOP to endorse .

The idea is splintering black activists and some prominent progressive lawmakers from Biden and top congressional Democrats while providing fodder for national Republicans, who are quickly mobilizing to use it as the latest example of Democrats moving to the left in the lead up to November.

A spokesman for Biden's campaign said Monday that the former vice president ""hears and shares the deep grief and frustration"" of those calling for reform, but that he ""does not believe that police should be defunded.”

Later, Biden made his position clear in an interview with CBS.

""No, I don't support defunding the police. I support conditioning federal aid to police based on whether or not they meet certain basic standards of decency and honorableness,"" he said.

Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill were adopting a similar position.

Karen Bass Karen Ruth BassRepublicans walk tightrope on police reform Hillicon Valley: Georgia officials launch investigation after election day chaos | Senate report finds Chinese telecom groups operated in US without proper oversight IBM terminates facial recognition technology business MORE (D-Calif.), the chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said when asked about efforts to defund the police.

Asked if the slogan of defunding the police was “politically problematic,” Bass said that she supported the “intent” behind it, including more investment in communities, but “I think it can be used as a distraction and that’s my concern.”

Bass and other Democrats on Monday offered a sweeping package of reforms they hope will build pressure on the GOP to endorse.

Trump himself , who often relishes bare-knuckle rhetoric , was more muted on the DACA decision . Speaking to reporters before a White House meeting on tax reform Tuesday , he said he had “ a great heart ” for the people who have benefited from the program .

Scott Mahaskey/███ Government Shutdown ‘ Feel like I ’ m going to strangle you ’ : Shutdown breaks Congress ’ spirit A week of setbacks to end the shutdown has left lawmakers in a dark mood .
A dismal mood has descended on Capitol Hill as the shutdown concludes its 27th day .
The House speaker and the president are at war . A bipartisan Senate push to reopen the government failed for a second consecutive week . And no shutdown talks are even planned between party leaders .
“ I feel like I ’ m going to strangle you , '' quipped one senator who 's tried in vain to find a breakthrough when a reporter asked about their state of mind .
That lawmaker was joking , probably , but the vibes in the Capitol are funereal at best . And with most members headed home for a long weekend , the partial shutdown is essentially guaranteed to enter into its second month . It ’ s an unheard-of impasse even in a capital that ’ s seen debt crises , blunt budget cuts and scores of unprecedented political conflicts over the past decade .
But this one feels different , a shutdown in which the dynamics are frozen . Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D-Calif. ) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ( D-N.Y. ) don ’ t want money for a border wall , and President Donald Trump wants $ 5.7 billion . Rank-and-file lawmakers can make noise and try to create momentum , but Trump has dismissed everything they ’ ve come up with — leading some members to wonder what they ’ re even doing .
“ It ’ s very frustrating for me because my whole instinct is : Let ’ s find a way to get this solved . But so far anyway , his idea of negotiating is to say , ‘ Here ’ s what I want , I ’ ll give you nothing , ’ ” said Sen. Angus King ( I-Maine ) , who tried to forge an immigration deal a year ago . “ I could sit down with Mike Pence for an afternoon and we might come to some agreement . And then [ Trump would ] blow it up . ”

Sen. Lisa Murkowski ( R-Alaska ) has seemingly tried everything to open up the government . She ’ s complained publicly about her party ’ s strategy . She ’ s signed on to a bipartisan letter urging Trump to end the shutdown in exchange for a three-week immigration debate , which was promptly rejected by the White House , according to sources familiar with the talks . She ’ s even endorsed moving forward with no wall money .

Scott Mahaskey/Politico Government Shutdown ‘Feel like I’m going to strangle you’: Shutdown breaks Congress’ spirit A week of setbacks to end the shutdown has left lawmakers in a dark mood.

A dismal mood has descended on Capitol Hill as the shutdown concludes its 27th day.

The House speaker and the president are at war. A bipartisan Senate push to reopen the government failed for a second consecutive week. And no shutdown talks are even planned between party leaders.

“I feel like I’m going to strangle you,"" quipped one senator who's tried in vain to find a breakthrough when a reporter asked about their state of mind.

That lawmaker was joking, probably, but the vibes in the Capitol are funereal at best. And with most members headed home for a long weekend, the partial shutdown is essentially guaranteed to enter into its second month. It’s an unheard-of impasse even in a capital that’s seen debt crises, blunt budget cuts and scores of unprecedented political conflicts over the past decade.

But this one feels different, a shutdown in which the dynamics are frozen. Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) don’t want money for a border wall, and President Donald Trump wants $5.7 billion. Rank-and-file lawmakers can make noise and try to create momentum, but Trump has dismissed everything they’ve come up with — leading some members to wonder what they’re even doing.

“It’s very frustrating for me because my whole instinct is: Let’s find a way to get this solved. But so far anyway, his idea of negotiating is to say, ‘Here’s what I want, I’ll give you nothing,’” said Sen. Angus King (I-Maine), who tried to forge an immigration deal a year ago. “I could sit down with Mike Pence for an afternoon and we might come to some agreement. And then [Trump would] blow it up.”

Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) has seemingly tried everything to open up the government. She’s complained publicly about her party’s strategy. She’s signed on to a bipartisan letter urging Trump to end the shutdown in exchange for a three-week immigration debate, which was promptly rejected by the White House, according to sources familiar with the talks. She’s even endorsed moving forward with no wall money.

On Thursday, her plans to travel to Europe for a conference on the Arctic had been canceled. And the Energy chairman was unsure whether she’d even be able to hold hearings next week with so many of her members out of town.

“Glum. Glum. I’m not a glum person. I’m not somebody who gets down.

The comments came after Boehner was forced on Tuesday to swallow a $ 39.7 billion DHS funding bill free of riders that would have blocked Obama ’ s efforts to defer deportations for 5 million undocumented immigrants . The bill , which passed the House 257-167 on the support of mostly Democrats , came after a tumultuous month in which conservative immigration hard-liners in the House pushed Boehner ’ s team to take an aggressive posture against Obama ’ s actions .

Gosar ’ s senior Arizona senator , John McCain , urged House conservatives to align with their party leadership ’ s strategy “ so we can go to the American people with a candidate for president in 2016 and say , ‘ Here ’ s what we ’ ve accomplished ’ — not a standoff between House and Senate Republicans . ”

And the White House , Republicans say , will need to put its political muscle behind measures that will face opposition from Democrats , such as the president ’ s trade agenda .
Sen. John Cornyn ( R-Texas ) , the Senate majority whip , blamed Democrats for the problems of the past several weeks , but acknowledged that his party could have handled the immigration fight more effectively .

“ The debt ceiling is a perfectly legitimate occasion to address that , ” Toomey said .

But as Congress ' attention slowly turns to other pressing end-of-year business , a movement is emerging to stop the refugee crackdown , and it ’ s not just Democrats leading the charge .
Some Republican lawmakers are expressing concerns about the House bill , saying refugees pose less of a national security threat than foreigners who arrive by other means . They are joined by a growing number of prominent conservatives — including national security elders such as Henry Kissinger— who are speaking out against the legislation , urging lawmakers to reconsider a bill passed in haste .
The House bill adds extra layers of screening for refugee applicants from Iraq and Syria , to the point where opponents say it essentially paralyzes a program aimed at helping desperate people fleeing violence . It has been fast-tracked in the Senate , but , with the odds of the Democratic filibuster high , Republicans are considering tucking it into a must-pass omnibus spending bill likely to be voted on next week .
Republican Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona said Tuesday that he is not happy with the House bill in its current form .
“ I ’ d like to see some changes to it , ” Flake said . “ If we look at all of our vulnerabilities out there , [ the refugee program ] is down the list a ways in my view , in terms of our security threats and issues . I ’ d rather address those things that are closer to the top . ”
Flake is working with Democrats to fix security gaps in the visa waiver program , which lets in people from many countries as tourists with far less scrutiny than refugees , who typically have to wait an average of 18-24 months before being cleared to resettle in the United States . Flake said he believes others in the GOP Senate caucus , after receiving briefings , are also beginning to see refugees as less of a threat than foreign nationals arriving other ways .
Another Republican lawmaker unhappy with the legislation is Rep. Steve Russell of Oklahoma . He voted for the bill with serious reservations but in hopes of affecting the debate as it moved ahead . If the existing bill were to come before the House again , “ I would vote against it , ” Russell said . “ I think it creates impossible barriers to refugees . ”
For Russell , the issue is personal . One of his close friends is an American citizen who was trying to get his mother out of Syria . The mother died this past summer before she could leave the war-torn country . Out of respect for his friend ’ s privacy , Russell , a retired Army lieutenant colonel , declined to offer specifics , including exactly what happened to the mother . But , he said , “ I ’ m certain had he been able to get her to the United States she ’ d still be alive . ”
Russell urged Republicans in the Senate to think carefully before supporting the House bill , saying they should not get refugees confused with the broader issue of immigration . He pointed out that in the past the U.S. has denied entry to people in need of help , including Jews fleeing the Nazis .

But as Congress' attention slowly turns to other pressing end-of-year business, a movement is emerging to stop the refugee crackdown, and it’s not just Democrats leading the charge.

Story Continued Below

Some Republican lawmakers are expressing concerns about the House bill, saying refugees pose less of a national security threat than foreigners who arrive by other means. They are joined by a growing number of prominent conservatives — including national security elders such as Henry Kissinger— who are speaking out against the legislation, urging lawmakers to reconsider a bill passed in haste.

The House bill adds extra layers of screening for refugee applicants from Iraq and Syria, to the point where opponents say it essentially paralyzes a program aimed at helping desperate people fleeing violence. It has been fast-tracked in the Senate, but, with the odds of the Democratic filibuster high, Republicans are considering tucking it into a must-pass omnibus spending bill likely to be voted on next week.

Republican Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona said Tuesday that he is not happy with the House bill in its current form.

“I’d like to see some changes to it,” Flake said. “If we look at all of our vulnerabilities out there, [the refugee program] is down the list a ways in my view, in terms of our security threats and issues. I’d rather address those things that are closer to the top.”

Flake is working with Democrats to fix security gaps in the visa waiver program, which lets in people from many countries as tourists with far less scrutiny than refugees, who typically have to wait an average of 18-24 months before being cleared to resettle in the United States. Flake said he believes others in the GOP Senate caucus, after receiving briefings, are also beginning to see refugees as less of a threat than foreign nationals arriving other ways.

Another Republican lawmaker unhappy with the legislation is Rep. Steve Russell of Oklahoma. He voted for the bill with serious reservations but in hopes of affecting the debate as it moved ahead. If the existing bill were to come before the House again, “I would vote against it,” Russell said. “I think it creates impossible barriers to refugees.”

For Russell, the issue is personal. One of his close friends is an American citizen who was trying to get his mother out of Syria. The mother died this past summer before she could leave the war-torn country. Out of respect for his friend’s privacy, Russell, a retired Army lieutenant colonel, declined to offer specifics, including exactly what happened to the mother. But, he said, “I’m certain had he been able to get her to the United States she’d still be alive.”

Russell urged Republicans in the Senate to think carefully before supporting the House bill, saying they should not get refugees confused with the broader issue of immigration. He pointed out that in the past the U.S. has denied entry to people in need of help, including Jews fleeing the Nazis.

“We have had dark periods when we have done this in the past,” he said. “History never judges it kindly — never.”

The reservations being expressed come as advocacy groups step up efforts to push Congress to scrap the bill. The loosely coordinated lobbying includes organizations and individuals from across the political spectrum—from the conservative National Association of Evangelicals to the liberal MoveOn.org. Their campaigns include everything from urging their supporters to call lawmakers to encouraging refugees to speak out about their stories.

In a letter to lawmakers released Tuesday, a group of national security experts, including figures prominent in Republican circles such as former Secretary of State Kissinger, retired Gen. David Petraeus and former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, urged a stop to the House bill.

Hard-fought negotiations led to a massive aid package

The stimulus package came together after intense and drawn-out negotiations between congressional Republicans and Democrats and the Trump administration that spanned multiple days and involved ongoing talks that stretched late into the night.

Democrats initially took issue with the package, which was crafted by Senate Republicans at the outset, arguing that it put corporations ahead of workers .

Key provisions in the stimulus

A centerpiece of the stimulus package is that it will provide direct financial assistance to Americans in the form of checks with the amount received based on income.

Individuals who earn $75,000 in adjusted gross income or less would get direct payments of $1,200 each, with married couples earning up to $150,000 receiving $2,400 -- and an additional $500 per each child.

Republicans continue to bash the Congressional Budget Office for what they say are inaccurate estimates of the impact of their legislation to repeal Obamacare. But the former directors of the nonpartisan organization wrote a letter to congressional leadership Friday asking Congress to keep using the CBO.

“As the House and Senate consider potential policy changes this year and in the years ahead, we urge you to maintain and respect the Congress’s decades-long reliance on CBO’s estimates in developing and scoring bills,” says the letter written to congressional leadership by eight former CBO directors.

The scores have been harsh, all showing that the various plans would increase the ranks of uninsured Americans by more than 20 million people.

On Friday, Reps. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., and Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, — the chairman and former chairman of the hardline conservative Freedom Caucus, respectively — published an op-ed in The Washington Examiner listing all the mistakes the CBO has made and calling on Congress to use a new analysis.

“It makes sense for Congress to explore the idea of reforming the culture of over-reliance on the CBO,” Meadows and Jordan write. “We still need independent, nonpartisan analysis to hold our government accountable, but a thoughtful bipartisan review of this issue may help us find a more accurate alternative to the CBO.”

The letter from the CBO directors acknowledges that the office hasn’t always been accurate in its analysis but goes on to say that the CBO gets it right more often than anybody else.

“Such analysis does generate estimates that are more accurate, on average, than estimates or guesses by people who are not objective and not as well informed as CBO’s analysts,” the letter reads.

Yet, despite all the bashing of the office from Republicans, the House GOP just offered to give the office its biggest raise in years.",www.usatoday.com,center,mYF46YwFYQJSvoQA

Still much to do

Congress has charged the FAA with figuring out how drones can share the skies with traditional aircraft, and the agency acknowledges that the task is complex and the workload is heavy.

In its Monday announcement, the FAA stated that the decision on test sites is part of a larger process of gathering information and conducting the research necessary to implement specific regulatory and legal frameworks for drones.

Before industries can take advantage, the FAA must construct a framework to govern what drones can do, where they can fly and what types of certifications operators must have, among other regulations.

Political issues

In the public’s eye, however, the more pressing matter is personal privacy. Many Americans see drones as the physical manifestations of a Big Brother culture that includes eye-in-the-sky cameras overhead at all times.

Revelations about the depth of government surveillance programs have only fueled fears that drones are the next step in an effort to watch everyone, all the time.

State and local governments have begun to address personal privacy through drone legislation. Such bills also have been introduced on Capitol Hill, but none has become law.

Lawmakers from states chosen for test sites said they were grateful to be on the forefront of aviation technology but recognize privacy concerns.

BALTIMORE — Two dozen Democrats are running for the nomination in Maryland ’ s 7th District , but no one looms larger over the race than the late Rep. Elijah E. Cummings , whose death last fall prompted the upcoming special election .
What Cummings wanted in a successor — and what people think he would have wanted — have become big factors in this contest , where the two best-known candidates are his widow , Maya Rockeymoore Cummings , and his friend and predecessor , Kweisi Mfume , who left Congress in 1996 to lead the NAACP .
“ My late husband was a beautiful man , ” Rockeymoore Cummings said , her voice rising as she addressed the congregation at Zion Baptist Church on Sunday . “ And I ask you to continue to pray for me and our family as we continue to walk this path . ”
But family in this race is complicated . The late congressman ’ s daughters are backing one of his former staffers , while at least two of his sisters were at a “ Women for Mfume ” rally later that day .
“ There ’ s nobody else that I would vote for . Not even my sister-in-law , ” said Cheretheria Blount , Cummings ’ 70-year-old sister .
“ My motto is : A vote for Maya Rockeymoore is not a vote for Elijah , ” added Diane Woodson , Cummings ’ 63-year-old sister .
But this race may also be a test of how much times have changed , with Rockeymoore Cummings — who is two decades younger than Mfume — striving to be the first woman to hold this seat and the only woman in Maryland ’ s all-male congressional delegation . Mfume is facing allegations of sexual harassment during his tenure at the NAACP , which he denies . In the two decades since he left Congress , though , similar allegations have derailed other lawmakers ’ careers .
Next week ’ s contest , expected to be a low-turnout election , has been overshadowed by the equally crowded April mayoral primary and by national Democrats jockeying to take on President Donald Trump .
Voters in this solidly blue district go to the polls next Tuesday , the day after the Iowa caucuses and the same day Trump is scheduled to deliver his State of the Union address . Whoever wins the Democratic primary will likely win the special general election on April 28 , which is the same day as the primary for the regular November election .
All eyes are on Mfume and Rockeymoore Cummings , but state Sen. Jill Carter has consolidated some progressive support , including the backing of 2018 gubernatorial nominee Ben Jealous , while law professor Michael Higginbotham has poured more than $ 500,000 of his own money into his campaign .

Black women are motivated voters , and they ’ re an influential part of the primary electorate in the 7th District , which includes parts of Baltimore City and Baltimore and Howard counties . Half of the district ’ s voters live in the city .
“ Black women are the heart and soul , the pumping power , of the Democratic Party . It is time that our party looked like us , ” state Del .

The executive committee took a secret vote in 2004 not to renew his contract , according to the Sun ’ s review of former NAACP Chairman Julian Bond ’ s papers , now at the University of Virginia .

A chance to make history

Seated in the second-from-the-front pew in church Sunday morning, Rockeymoore Cummings often had a hand outstretched — either above her in prayer or to the side to embrace a fellow parishioner. The women who packed the service — even those who said they hadn’t made up their minds about whom to support — beamed at her.

“I was a single man who, on the job, dated a single woman for about six months,” he said. “There were, I think, one or two other people who thought, ‘Maybe he should have been dating me.’”

Rockeymoore Cummings doesn’t lean into these allegations explicitly.

“Voters want people who have exhibited good judgment in the past,” she told CQ Roll Call when asked about them.

“I’m standing for women, that I’m not about exploitation, that I’m focused on women’s empowerment and opportunities,” she added.

Two familiar names

The women here weren’t bothered by the sexual harassment allegations against the former congressman, if they even believed them.

us_congress,Washington Times,2,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/dec/15/republicans-unveil-tax-cut-package/,Republicans unveil $1.5 trillion tax-cut package,2017-12-15,David Sherfinski,"Congressional Republicans late Friday officially unveiled their final $ 1.4 trillion-plus tax-cut plan that slashes corporate and individual rates , winds down certain credits and exemptions , and imposes new international tax rules .
The conference report that House and Senate lawmakers agreed on caps months of work and negotiations among Republicans , who are hoping for quick passage of the top legislative priority next week .
“ This April 15th , when you file your taxes , that is the last time you will file under this monstrous , broken tax code , ” said House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady , Congress ’ s top tax-writer .
Republican leaders in the House and Senate said they plan to hold votes next week in order to get the measure to President Trump ’ s desk before Christmas .
The plan lowers the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective Jan. 1 — a change Republicans are billing as the biggest corporate tax rate reduction in U.S. history .
It preserves the existing number of individual tax rates at seven , not counting the zero rate , and lowers the top rate from 39.6 percent to 37 percent .
The new top rate applies to individuals making more than $ 500,000 and couples making more than $ 600,000 . Under current law , the top rate of 39.6 percent applies to individuals making more than $ 418,400 and couples making more than $ 470,700 .
The new individual rates would be effective for 2018 , but are set to expire after 2025 — a gimmick Republicans used to keep the plan ’ s overall price tag within the $ 1.5 trillion limit set by fast-track budget rules .
GOP leaders have said they anticipate future lawmakers will simply extend the cuts down the road .
The bill also roughly doubles the standard deduction to $ 12,000 for individuals and $ 24,000 for families , which increases the number of “ zero filers ” who face no federal income tax liability and the amount of income not subject to taxation for those who opt to take the standard deduction .

“ This tax bill is a moral and economic obscenity , ” said Sen. Bernard Sanders , Vermont Independent . “ It is a gift to wealthy Republican campaign contributors and an insult to the working families of our country . ”","Congressional Republicans late Friday officially unveiled their final $1.4 trillion-plus tax-cut plan that slashes corporate and individual rates, winds down certain credits and exemptions, and imposes new international tax rules.

The conference report that House and Senate lawmakers agreed on caps months of work and negotiations among Republicans, who are hoping for quick passage of the top legislative priority next week.

“This April 15th, when you file your taxes, that is the last time you will file under this monstrous, broken tax code,” said House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, Congress’s top tax-writer.

Republican leaders in the House and Senate said they plan to hold votes next week in order to get the measure to President Trump’s desk before Christmas.

The plan lowers the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective Jan. 1 — a change Republicans are billing as the biggest corporate tax rate reduction in U.S. history.

It preserves the existing number of individual tax rates at seven, not counting the zero rate, and lowers the top rate from 39.6 percent to 37 percent.

The new top rate applies to individuals making more than $500,000 and couples making more than $600,000. Under current law, the top rate of 39.6 percent applies to individuals making more than $418,400 and couples making more than $470,700.

The new individual rates would be effective for 2018, but are set to expire after 2025 — a gimmick Republicans used to keep the plan’s overall price tag within the $1.5 trillion limit set by fast-track budget rules.

GOP leaders have said they anticipate future lawmakers will simply extend the cuts down the road.

The bill also roughly doubles the standard deduction to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for families, which increases the number of “zero filers” who face no federal income tax liability and the amount of income not subject to taxation for those who opt to take the standard deduction.

It preserves the current mortgage interest deduction for existing mortgages, but imposes a $750,000 cap for future mortgages. It also preserves the existing deduction for charitable contributions.

It also doubles the current exemption for the estate tax on inheritances from $5 million to $10 million, so fewer people will be affected.

For small businesses, there is a new 20 percent deduction that applies to the first $315,000 of joint income for so-called “pass-through” companies that file their taxes as individuals.

For income above that level, there’s a deduction for up to 20 percent on profits, a move tax-writers estimate would reduce marginal tax rates to a maximum of 29.6 percent.

Businesses will also be able to immediately write off capital expenses for new equipment, rather than the current system that has them do it over a number of years.

The bill repeals the corporate alternative minimum tax, which is intended to make sure all companies pay at least some tax, and raises the income thresholds for the individual alternative minimum tax.

Tim Kaine said Friday President Trump is required under the Constitution to receive an authorization of war from Congress before carrying out attacks like the missile strike against the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad .
Mr. Kaine , Virginia Democrat , is among a small bipartisan group of senators that have criticized lawmakers on Capitol Hill for abdicating their responsibility to the president when it comes to declarations of war , raising concerns about the nation getting involved in unchecked , perpetual military action without forcing members of Congress to cast a vote .

Mr. Trump ordered missile strikes in Syria Thursday without seeking authorization from Congress , drawing criticism from some Republicans and Democrats .
President Obama helped lay the foundation for Mr. Trump ’ s action .
Before entering office , Mr. Obama took issue with the expansive wars being fought under 2001 and 2002 authorizations of the use of military force , but went on to rely on those same authorizations , including when he signed off on action against Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and expanded the U.S. commitment to fight al-Shabab in Somalia .
At the time , Mr. Kaine pushed back against the Obama administration . Now he focused on Mr. Trump .
“ Just because Congress has abdicated in the past doesn ’ t mean that a president can start a new war and say , ‘ Well I don ’ t ever have to go to Congress now , ’ ” Mr. Kaine said Friday . “ The Constitutional command is clear .

In halting English , dressed in the white pontifical robes and reading from printed text rather than teleprompters that have become ubiquitous for politicians , the pope proclaimed himself a believer in the American dream , but set his sights globally , calling for a halt to the world arms trade and “ new global forms of slavery . ”
He gave only the briefest of nods to the abortion-related debates that have riven American Catholicism in recent decades , instead turning his pro-life message into a forceful plea for abolition of the death penalty .
He also urged Americans to embrace immigrants from Central and South America , saying they are only doing what anyone else would in their situation . He said their plight should invoke the Golden Rule and implored compassion from the U.S .
“ This rule points us in a clear direction : Let us treat others with the same passion and compassion with which we want to be treated . Let us seek for others the same possibilities which we seek for ourselves , ” he said . “ In a word , if we want security , let us give security . If we want life , let us give life . If we want opportunities , let us provide opportunities .
“ The yardstick we use for others will be the yardstick which time will use for us , ” the pontiff said , drawing a standing ovation from the assembled House and Senate .
Emerging from the House chamber , he paused to reflect at a statue of St. Junipero Serra , the founder of nine California mission churches in the 18th century , whom the pope canonized as a saint in a Mass on Wednesday .
The pontiff then appeared on the balcony overlooking the National Mall on the Capitol ’ s west front , where he delivered a special blessing for the children who were among tens of thousands who gathered to hear the address simulcast on monitors outside .
After speaking to the country ’ s powerful , he drove a dozen blocks to St. Patrick ’ s Church and the Washington Archdiocese ’ s branch of Catholic Charities , where some of the city ’ s homeless were gathered to share a meal with him .
After leaving Washington on a chartered American Airlines jet , he arrived in New York to be greeted by a high school brass band playing the Frank Sinatra standard “ New York , New York . ”
Thousands of cheering people lined the streets of lower Manhattan as Francis made his way to St. Patrick ’ s Cathedral for an evening vespers prayer service , where he specifically thanked American nuns , a move seen as an apology for a crackdown on dissent in their orders by his predecessors .
He told the cathedral pews full of U.S. ordained and religious that he wanted to thank American nuns for their courage and spirit and “ that I love you very much . ”
On Friday in New York , Francis will address the United Nations , participate in an interfaith service at the Sept. 11 memorial , visit a Catholic school in Harlem and celebrate Mass at Madison Square Garden .
He heads to Philadelphia on Saturday morning for a weekend of meetings on church doctrine on the family .
His speech Thursday marked the first time the head of the Roman Catholic Church has addressed Congress — an event that sprang chiefly from the efforts of House Speaker John A. Boehner , an Ohio Republican and a Catholic , who pursued the invitation after the pope announced the Philadelphia meetings last year .
Mr. Boehner , known for getting emotional , repeatedly wiped tears from his eyes as he sat on the dais behind the pope , listening to the steward of his church both praise and challenge America . Also sitting behind the pope was another Catholic , Vice President Joseph R. Biden .
“ What a moment for our country , ” Mr. Boehner said afterward . “ The Holy Father ’ s visit is surely a blessing for all of us . With great blessings , of course , come great responsibility . ”
Indeed , the pope ’ s address met with universal praise , though it wasn ’ t always clear that those doing the praising had heard the same speech .
Crusaders against global warming said the pontiff ’ s call to action was historic and they hoped it would spark a change in those who have been skeptical of drastic steps to combat climate change . The pope specifically countered arguments advanced by climate change skeptics , including many of the Republican presidential candidates in a debate last week , that Democratic proposals would damage the U.S. economy with little effect on overall levels of carbon emissions .
“ I am convinced that we can make a difference , ” Francis said , adding that technological advances gave him reason for optimism . “ In this regard , I am confident that America ’ s outstanding academic and research institutions can make a vital contribution in the years ahead . ”
But Sen. James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma , the top Republican on the Environment and Public Works Committee , said the pontiff ’ s remarks were a rebuke to President Obama ’ s approach . Mr. Inhofe focused on Pope Francis ‘ call for “ this Congress ” to act and said that was a recognition that Congress , not the White House , should be setting policies .
“ I hope the president will take heed to the pope ’ s words , ” Mr. Inhofe said .
Absent from the nearly hourlong speech was any specific mention of Jesus . Pope Francis made just a single reference to Scripture , when he quoted the origins of the Golden Rule from the Gospel of Matthew .
Instead , he said Americans can find inspiration in four figures of history : former President Abraham Lincoln , civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr. , Catholic peace activist Dorothy Day , and Trappist monk Thomas Merton , one of the more powerful American Catholic voices of the 20th century .
He also sounded a stern warning about the decline of the traditional family , saying it is “ threatened , perhaps as never before , from within and without . ”
But as with much of the rest of his address , he issued a diagnosis but didn ’ t offer a specific prescription , instead calling for awareness of the conflicting messages youths receive .
“ At the risk of oversimplifying , we might say that we live in a culture which pressures young people not to start a family , because they lack possibilities for the future . Yet this same culture presents others with so many options that they too are dissuaded from starting a family , ” he said .
At one point , he blamed “ immaturity on the part of many adults ” for the problems faced by the young but never identified exactly what he meant , referring instead to cultural “ pressures . ”
“ Their problems are our problems . We can not avoid them , ” he said .
Casting his eye globally , the pope said every religion is susceptible to fundamentalism and warned against overzealous adherence to “ a religion , an ideology or an economic system . ”
He also cautioned against seeing world conflicts in black and white — “ the simplistic reductionism which sees only good or evil ; or , if you will , the righteous and sinners . ”
“ We know that in the attempt to be freed of the enemy without , we can be tempted to feed the enemy within , ” he said . “ To imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place . That is something which you , as a people , reject . ”","Pope Francis called on Americans to fully embrace the Golden Rule in politics as the head of the world’s 1.2 billion Catholics delivered a sermon on Capitol Hill on Thursday, challenging Congress and voters alike to serve the needy and to see the world in nuance rather than the “simplistic reductionism which sees only good or evil.”

us_congress,Fox Online News,2,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/06/26/issa-challenges-obama-executive-privilege-claim-on-furious/,White House refers to Issa's analysis of Fast & Furious as 'absurd' ,2012-06-26,,"A challenge to President Obama using executive privilege in the investigation into the federal government ’ s failed Fast and Furious gun-tracking operation was met Tuesday with a strong White House response in which a spokesman referred to the probe as “ absurd . ”
The challenge was made Monday in a letter from GOP Rep. Darrell Issa , chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee . He suggested in part that executive privilege was invoked because high-level White House officials were perhaps involved in the Justice Department operation and that the administration has failed to provide case law supporting its decision to invoke the privilege .
“ The congressman ’ s analysis has as much merit as his absurd contention that Operation Fast and Furious was created in order to promote gun control . Our position is consistent with executive branch legal precedent for the past three decades , ” said White House spokesman Eric Schultz . “ The courts have routinely … affirmed the right of the executive branch to invoke the privilege even when White House documents are not involved . ”

Gun-walking long has been barred by Justice Department policy , but federal agents in Arizona experimented with it in at least two investigations during the George W.

The challenge was made Monday in a letter from GOP Rep. Darrell Issa, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. He suggested in part that executive privilege was invoked because high-level White House officials were perhaps involved in the Justice Department operation and that the administration has failed to provide case law supporting its decision to invoke the privilege.

“The congressman’s analysis has as much merit as his absurd contention that Operation Fast and Furious was created in order to promote gun control. Our position is consistent with executive branch legal precedent for the past three decades,” said White House spokesman Eric Schultz. “The courts have routinely … affirmed the right of the executive branch to invoke the privilege even when White House documents are not involved.”

A full House vote is scheduled Thursday on whether to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress for failing to comply with two subpoenas requesting addition documents regarding the botched operation.

The White House response Tuesday cites several legal precedents and opinions from legal scholars that Schultz says “affirms the precedent.”

Obama's claim broadly covers administration documents about the operation, not just those prepared for the president. But Issa, R-Calif., maintains the privilege is reserved for documents to and from the president and his most senior advisers.

In Issa’s letter to the president, dated Monday and made public Tuesday, he cited an appellate court decision to back his claim and questioned whether Obama was asserting a presidential power ""solely for the purpose of further obstructing a congressional investigation.""

During President Obama's speech Tuesday night, Sen. Carl Levin will be doing what he's done at every State of the Union for decades: sitting with his older brother and fellow Michigan Democrat Rep. Sandy Levin.

No two siblings in the nation's history have served longer than the 32 years the brothers Levin have been together in Congress. Both have held powerful committee chairmanships.

But this will be their last State of the Union together. Carl, who was first elected to Congress four years before his brother, has decided to retire at the end of the year.

When Sandy Levin shows up at Carl's office — a suite of high-ceilinged rooms next to Harry Truman's old Senate digs — Carl protectively steers him toward a cozy alcove at the end of a long meeting room.

""I think we're going to go in here,"" he says, ""because it's too cold in my office.""

Carl is the 79-year-old brother with the gold-rimmed reading glasses permanently perched at the end of his nose. It's an image Comedy Central's Jon Stewart once described as ""this kindly old shoemaker.""

Sandy, who's 82, sports a halo of snowy white hair. Being in Congress with his brother, he says, has been a good thing.

""People like brothers, when they do their own thing, together,"" he says. Which is, Carl adds, what they've always done.

""We spent most of our lives together, including as kids, in the same bedroom together, including law school, and about 30,000 games of squash that we've played together,"" Carl says. ""Both of us will tell you we don't have any idea who won more of those games. We have the same line.""

Carl now calls himself a Midwest progressive; Sandy's politics are almost identical — based on, he says, a concern for the underdog.

""It really goes back to how we were raised,"" Sandy says. ""Everybody counted. Everybody should count. We were imbued with that; I mean, that's why Joe Louis was such a hero.""

Sandy ran for governor of Michigan twice, and lost twice, before Carl captured a Senate seat on his first try in 1978.

""No, sir,"" Gates answered.

Levin's colleagues from both parties say they're sorry he's leaving the Senate.

Still, it wasn't easy for the older Levin.

""I took it rather hard,"" says Sandy.

Yet Sandy is running for re-election next year and says he's more determined than ever to keep fighting for the things he believes in.

Paradoxically, Carl says he feels the same way: ""I could not see myself out campaigning for re-election and raising money and spending all that time."" Time that Carl says he would rather spend this year finishing his job as a senator. After that, it will be up to Sandy to carry on.

If you want to know how truly devastating the economic damage is right now, just look at this response. The scary part? This comment from a senator to CNN Sunday night: ""This still isn't enough. Not even close.""

About that optimism

There was no shortage of optimism on Sunday as Democrats and administration officials made clear a deal was near, and leaders in both parties held calls with their respective caucuses to lay the groundwork for the agreement. But they aren't there yet, according to multiple people involved. Late Sunday night, the two sides were still having significant disagreements on a few elements on the package, the people said.

""This will get done. It has to,"" one source told CNN before cautioning that action as soon as Monday was ""maybe a bit too optimistic.""

What to watch Monday:

When a deal is announced.

What the actual legislative text of that deal looks like.

What the timeline is for moving forward on the House and Senate.

What lawmakers and small business owners are talking about

In the dozens of conversations we've had with small business owners and lawmakers over the last several days about various elements of the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program, almost to a person, one thing has been a constant: frustration (and in some cases white-hot rage) about the large restaurants that have received PPP loans.

To be clear, it's all legal -- and the result of a specific provision in the law restaurants lobbied for during the legislative drafting of the program (and many, many lawmakers hearing from restaurants back in their states and districts were supportive of that carve-out, it should be noted).

But Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, Potbelly, J. Alexander's, Jura Sushi and others announcing in government filings they'd received millions from a tapped-out small business program has drawn significant anger from small business owners -- and some reflection from lawmakers who wish the law was drafted in a tighter manner.

That said, public pressure, particularly in instances like this, can often do far more than legislative amendments.

Heads up

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat, notified members Sunday they would need to return to Washington this week to vote on the package. Democrats have expected Republicans will call for a recorded vote. The expectation is it would occur sometime mid-week, but it all depends on a final agreement being reached.

The deal's top lines

SBA PPP program: $310 billion

SBA Economic Injury Disaster Loan program: $60 billion

Hospital funding: $75 billion

Testing funding: $25 billion

The sticking points

The biggest sticking point is over the testing piece of the package. Democrats want Republicans to agree to making the Trump administration come up with a national testing plan in addition to the $25 billion they want to boost testing. The money isn't an issue. But multiple sources say that attaching strings that could potentially put the President and the administration in the seat for a political blame game is an issue.

""Republicans view this as a political play,"" one source said.

A reality check package

The longer these negotiations have gone on, the more obvious it has become that the needs are far greater than replenishing the depleted PPP funds. What began as a straight $251 billion request to increase money for the PPP has morphed into a package that is expected to include $75 billion for hospitals and at least $25 billion to boost the country's testing capacity in addition to more money for SBA.

The money for SBA has also grown to at least $300 billion for the PPP loan program and additional money for Economic Injury Disaster Loan Emergency Advance that has faced a massive increase in application volume over the last month.

The growing cost of the legislation is symptom of just how rapidly the economic outlook for the country is shifting week to week. What began as an offer by Republicans to simply increase the amount of money for SBA became a much larger bill in part because members themselves were hearing from cash-strapped hospitals. And, as the country grows tired of stay-at-home-orders, testing is only becoming more of a priority for Americans anxious to get back to work.

Where Democrats stand

Democrats, if they are being candid, will acknowledge the push for state and local government funding has been a bridge too far for days now. They wanted it, they won't get it, but they will get significant funds for several other key pieces they've pushed for the last two weeks.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi held a call with her leadership team on Sunday and Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer has remained in close touch with his members over the last several days as the deal has come together.

Where Senate Republicans stand

Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, held a call with his members Sunday afternoon to gauge support for the broad outlines of the package. The call also included President Donald Trump, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. According to one source familiar, Trump said little on the call, but his presence spoke volumes about his desire to get the package passed quickly. Again, when you can only pass items by unanimous consent, you have to have every single member on board. Trump's presence on the call was intended to send a message that this is important to the President.

Where House Republicans stand

House Republicans also held a Sunday call with Mnuchin and Meadows. The call was an opportunity to brief members on the latest contours of negotiations, but also another chance for Republicans to voice the concerns they have about specific regulations related to PPP.

Rep. Mark Amodei, a Republican from Nevada, continues to share his concerns on the calls that smaller casinos aren't eligible for PPP loans.

Members also raised concerns Sunday that restaurants applying for PPP are having a hard time getting workers to come back under their payroll because in some instances, unemployment insurance payments are higher than what they could provide. Remember: PPP is supposed to go largely to paying payroll costs (Treasury wrote it so that 75% of the loan is supposed to go to payroll), something Republicans and Democrats have voiced frustrations with. Many argue that businesses like restaurants need the money to pay utilities or high rent.

Where the administration stands

The administration, and congressional Republicans, drew one clear line in the sand in opposing Democratic efforts to add funding for state and local governments to the package. But there's no question Mnuchin and the White House have moved toward Democrats on this looming deal. That said, much of what Democrats were asking for wasn't all that controversial. But it did take time to pull together, draft and agree on (an agreement that still hasn't been officially clinched as of Monday afternoon). That fact has outraged Republicans who simply wanted to re-up the funding for a program that was already massively oversubscribed.

Mnuchin, in his interview on CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday, made clear funds for state and local governments would be a piece of the next legislative package.

""The President has heard from the governors and he's prepared to discuss that in the next bill,"" Mnuchin said.

The House voted to override 348–77, clearing the two-thirds threshold required by the Constitution. Eighteen Republicans and 59 Democrats voted to sustain Obama’s action; Rep. James Clyburn (S.C.) was the only member of the Democratic leadership to vote with the president.

Among the Republicans who sided with the president were five committee chairmen: Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz Jason ChaffetzElijah Cummings, Democratic chairman and powerful Trump critic, dies at 68 House Oversight panel demands DeVos turn over personal email records The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by JUUL Labs - Trump attack on progressive Dems draws sharp rebuke MORE (Utah), Rules Committee Chairman Pete Sessions (Texas), Education and the Workforce Committee Chairman John Kline (Minn.), Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry (Texas) and Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (Calif.).

Rep. Kathy Castor (D-Fla.) voted “present.”

“As you look at it and talk to people now, people on the Judiciary Committee didn’t even realize at the time what was happening when it went to the floor,” Corker said.

Recriminations flew both ways, as lawmakers accused the White House of making a lackadaisical effort to stop the bill.

“What’s so remarkable to me is the detachment of this White House from anything to do with the legislative process,” he said.

“They were basically missing in action during this whole process.”

Corker said Wednesday he was unable to get a meeting with White House officials to discuss the legislation after reaching out to them “multiple times.”

“There’s been zero involvement from the White House, zero, and when you have a veto like this it takes involvement,” he said. “There’s nothing.”

Administration officials said they knew from the start that Obama’s veto was unlikely to survive an override vote — the politics surrounding the bill had become so charged that they overwhelmed the more abstract arguments for the importance of respecting foreign sovereign immunity.

Any talk that Obama had a chance of winning a showdown on the Senate and House floors didn’t come from the White House, one official said.

The vote was a big win for New York Sen. Charles Schumer Charles (Chuck) Ellis SchumerOvernight Health Care: Trump officials making changes to drug pricing proposal | House panel advances flavored e-cig ban | Senators press FDA tobacco chief on vaping ban Chad Wolf becomes acting DHS secretary Schumer blocks drug pricing measure during Senate fight, seeking larger action MORE, the bill’s lead Democratic sponsor in the Senate. He pushed the legislation for years at the behest of his home state’s constituents, who suffered the brunt of the terrorist attacks 15 years ago.

Schumer said he didn’t relish taking on his own president but said there was a pressing need to deliver a measure of justice to the victims of Sept. 11.

“This is a decision I do not take lightly, but as one of the authors of this legislation I am a firm believer in its purpose,” he said in a floor speech delivered shortly before the vote.

“Do we really want it established inflexibly in precedent that foreign actors directly responsible for financing terrorist attacks on U.S. soil are beyond the reach of justice?”

The legislation amends the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act so foreign sponsors of terrorism cannot invoke sovereign immunity to stay out of U.S. courts if sued.

Even though senators decided with near unanimity to overturn Obama’s veto, some acknowledged doubts about the bill in the aftermath.

A group of senators huddled on the floor Tuesday to discuss the possibility of moving legislation in the next several months to narrow the scope of the law, potentially limiting the legal options of U.S. plaintiffs but also giving more protection to Americans who might end up in foreign courts.

The government shuts down Sept. 30. The farm bill isn’t done. The appropriations process is in shambles. Immigration reform is stagnant.

And Congress is heading for the exits.

Story Continued Below

The tensions on Capitol Hill are high, as legislative achievements are low.

The anger, frustration and disappointment was exposed after the House Republican leadership pulled a transportation spending bill from the floor this week because funding levels were too high for some, too low for others. Instead of recalibrating, House Republicans moved onto a series of bills aimed at stopping what they consider government abuse — legislation that dovetails with their August messaging.

Rep. Tom Latham (R-Iowa), the chair of the subcommittee that wrote the bill, stood up at a Wednesday afternoon meeting and yelled at attendees — including his best friend, Speaker John Boehner — “this is bullshit,” referring to leadership pulling his bill without warning.

Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers (R-Ky.), so frustrated by the stymied pace of spending bills, said he won’t pen a year-long continuing resolution, and his committee will not vote for it. The House has passed just four of 12 appropriations bills.

As Congress leaves town for a five-week recess, it faces no shortage of unsolved challenges. There is no clear strategy for funding the government beyond Sept. 30 and lifting the debt ceiling, the two fiscal fights looming in the fall.

Another big battle is how the sequester and its automatic budget cuts play out in 2014. House Republicans want to replace steep cuts with entitlement changes but continue to take a hard line on non-defense spending. Democrats and some Senate Republicans oppose this tack and would be willing to consider new revenue.

There’s not even agreement on the level at which the government will be funded: House Republicans want to set spending at a level of $967 billion, and Senate Democrats are aiming for $1.058 trillion. How long will a stop-gap bill last? There’s no agreement on that either.

This is all rooted in the chambers’ inability to pass spending bills. After the House pulled its transportation bill, the Senate rejected its own transportation bill written by Sens. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine). Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) whipped Republicans to oppose the legislation, arguing that it would violate the 2011 Budget Control Act that birthed the sequester.

Collins was the only Republican to support the bill. McConnell indicated the bill’s failure is evidence of the firm stance he will take entering the bruising fall negotiations.

“This vote is of symbolic significance going into the fall, when we all obviously have the inevitable discussion about how to fund the government,” McConnell said.

All of this inaction has some people fed up. One House Republican is so mad, he’s openly defying his leadership. Rep. Scott Rigell (R-Va.) is so angry Congress is leaving town, he voted against a rule (a procedural motion to bring a bill to the floor). He spent part of Thursday fielding calls from leadership, urging him to change his mind. He said he wouldn’t.

John Conyers ( D-MI ) announced on Tuesday that he is retiring from Congress . Facing mounting claims of sexual misconduct and harassment from former female staffers , Conyers told a local radio host he will retire immediately .
Conyers also said he will endorse his son John Conyers III in the race for his seat . In a twist , Conyers ’ s grandnephew , state Sen. Ian Conyers , has also announced plans to run for that seat . Ian Conyers first broke the news that his uncle was stepping down to the New York Times earlier on Tuesday .
While the elder Conyers told Detroit radio host Mildred Gaddis that the allegations against him aren ’ t true , he added it was time to step down and clear the path for his son to run .
`` My legacy can ’ t be compromised or diminished in any way by what we ’ re going through now . This too shall pass . … My legacy will continue through my children , '' Conyers said .
He also continued to deny the allegations that have been made against him .
“ They 're not accurate , they 're not true and they 're something I ca n't explain where they came from , ” Conyers said .
Conyers , 88 , is the longest-serving member of the House of Representatives , to which he was elected in 1964 . Until last week , he had served as the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee , and he is one of the founding members of the powerful Congressional Black Caucus . He has been absent from Capitol Hill for the past few weeks , flying back to his home state of Michigan . He was recently treated at a local hospital for a “ stress-related illness , ” a family spokesperson told reporters .
BuzzFeed first reported that Conyers had settled a wrongful dismissal complaint with a female staffer in 2015 , after the woman alleged she was fired from his House office after she refused to “ succumb to [ his ] sexual advances. ” BuzzFeed also obtained signed affidavits in which more of Conyers ’ s staff accused him of “ requests for sex acts , contacting and transporting other women with whom they believed Conyers was having affairs , caressing their hands sexually , and rubbing their legs and backs in public . ”
Conyers has denied the allegations of sexual misconduct , but he confirmed to BuzzFeed that he had paid his former staffer $ 27,000 as part of the settlement .
“ My office resolved the allegations — with an express denial of liability — in order to save all involved from the rigors of protracted litigation , ” he said in a statement . “ The resolution was not for millions of dollars , but rather for an amount that equated to a reasonable severance payment . ”
Democrats and Republicans have been slow on calling for politicians accused of sexual misconduct to resign
Democratic House members largely stayed silent on the question of whether Conyers should resign until House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( D-CA ) publicly called for him to step down last week . Before then , only two female Congress members , Reps. Kathleen Rice ( D-NY ) and Pramila Jayapal ( D-WA ) , had called on Conyers to resign .
The House Ethics Committee is currently investigating Conyers ’ s conduct ; at first , Pelosi and other lawmakers said the investigation should be able to take its course .

There have been fewer calls from Democratic senators for Franken to resign . And over in the House , Republicans are dealing with their own sexual harassment scandal , after Politico reported that Rep. Blake Farenthold used $ 84,000 in taxpayer money to settle with a former staffer who accused him of sexual harassment .
Republican leaders are also divided on what to do with Farenthold . House Speaker Paul Ryan has said he won ’ t call on Farenthold to resign ( even though he has called on Conyers to step down ) , but other representatives say the Texas Republican needs to go as well as pay back the $ 84,000 of taxpayer money he used to settle the claim .","Embattled Rep. John Conyers (D-MI) announced on Tuesday that he is retiring from Congress. Facing mounting claims of sexual misconduct and harassment from former female staffers, Conyers told a local radio host he will retire immediately.

Conyers also said he will endorse his son John Conyers III in the race for his seat. In a twist, Conyers’s grandnephew, state Sen. Ian Conyers, has also announced plans to run for that seat. Ian Conyers first broke the news that his uncle was stepping down to the New York Times earlier on Tuesday.

While the elder Conyers told Detroit radio host Mildred Gaddis that the allegations against him aren’t true, he added it was time to step down and clear the path for his son to run.

""My legacy can’t be compromised or diminished in any way by what we’re going through now. This too shall pass. … My legacy will continue through my children,"" Conyers said.

He also continued to deny the allegations that have been made against him.

“They're not accurate, they're not true and they're something I can't explain where they came from,” Conyers said.

Conyers, 88, is the longest-serving member of the House of Representatives, to which he was elected in 1964. Until last week, he had served as the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, and he is one of the founding members of the powerful Congressional Black Caucus. He has been absent from Capitol Hill for the past few weeks, flying back to his home state of Michigan. He was recently treated at a local hospital for a “stress-related illness,” a family spokesperson told reporters.

BuzzFeed first reported that Conyers had settled a wrongful dismissal complaint with a female staffer in 2015, after the woman alleged she was fired from his House office after she refused to “succumb to [his] sexual advances.” BuzzFeed also obtained signed affidavits in which more of Conyers’s staff accused him of “requests for sex acts, contacting and transporting other women with whom they believed Conyers was having affairs, caressing their hands sexually, and rubbing their legs and backs in public.”

Conyers has denied the allegations of sexual misconduct, but he confirmed to BuzzFeed that he had paid his former staffer $27,000 as part of the settlement.

“My office resolved the allegations — with an express denial of liability — in order to save all involved from the rigors of protracted litigation,” he said in a statement. “The resolution was not for millions of dollars, but rather for an amount that equated to a reasonable severance payment.”

Democrats and Republicans have been slow on calling for politicians accused of sexual misconduct to resign

Democratic House members largely stayed silent on the question of whether Conyers should resign until House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) publicly called for him to step down last week. Before then, only two female Congress members, Reps. Kathleen Rice (D-NY) and Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), had called on Conyers to resign.

The House Ethics Committee is currently investigating Conyers’s conduct; at first, Pelosi and other lawmakers said the investigation should be able to take its course.

Pelosi previously defended Conyers and said he was entitled to due process during a Meet the Press interview on November 26. She also appeared to question Conyers’s accusers during the interview.

“I don’t know who they are,” Pelosi told NBC’s Chuck Todd. “Do you? They have not really come forward.”

But amid growing pressure last week, she abruptly changed her position.

“The allegations against Congressman Conyers are serious, disappointing, and very credible,” Pelosi said Thursday during a weekly press conference. “The brave women who came forward are owed justice. I pray for Congressman Conyers and his family and wish them well, however; Congressman Conyers should resign.”

Other Democratic representatives soon followed suit, leading to yet another controversy. Politico reported last week that the Congressional Black Caucus, which Conyers helped found, was infuriated that Conyers was being pressured to resign while Sen. Al Franken (D-MN) was not, despite being accused of sexual harassment by six women. Members hinted that they believed that had to do with Conyers’s race.

“Nancy Pelosi is going to have to explain what is the discernible difference between Al Franken and John Conyers,” Arnold Reed, Conyers’s attorney, told reporters last week.

There have been fewer calls from Democratic senators for Franken to resign. And over in the House, Republicans are dealing with their own sexual harassment scandal, after Politico reported that Rep.

They failed , spectacularly , in late July . They have come up short again two months later .
Senate Republicans , after a mad dash to revive a last-ditch Obamacare repeal plan before a September 30 deadline , have conceded defeat once again . They have come up with four different plans to overhaul the health care law , and none of them could win 50 Republican votes .
Obamacare repeal can never truly die as long as Republicans control every branch of government , but the hopes are fading . A plan that can stretch from the moderate to conservative wings of the GOP has yet to materialize . Congress is preparing to move on to tax reform .
Republicans , including the Obamacare opponents outside the halls of the Capitol who so often set the agenda for Congress , are in uncharted territory , wandering the wilderness without the promise of Obamacare repeal to cling to . Now they are beginning to imagine what life looks like now that the dream of “ Obamacare repeal ” might really be dead .
Before this most recent repeal plan fell short , I asked six of these Obamacare opponents , policy experts at conservative and libertarian think tanks , what they learned from the repeated failures of Obamacare repeal and what they think happens now , in this strange new reality we all occupy .
They mostly agreed that Republicans should drop the idea of “ repealing and replacing ” Obamacare — but otherwise there was little consensus . Some think the next steps must be incremental and bipartisan . Others think that there is still a place for comprehensive health care reform plans . Given the increasing appetite for Democrats to embrace single payer , some aren ’ t sure they have trustworthy allies on the other side of the aisle . At least one is still holding out hope that Obamacare could be undone , and soon .
Wounds must be licked and fissures must be healed , but the overall impression is a movement moving on from perhaps the most disastrous and humiliating legislative failure in a generation . They aren ’ t sure quite sure where they ’ re heading . But they have some ideas .
1 ) It ’ s probably time to let go of “ repeal and replace ”
From the day Obamacare passed , Republicans ran on a pledge to “ repeal and replace ” it . The problem , almost everyone I talked to agreed , is they never ended up agreeing on what exactly that would mean .
“ Repeal and replace ” was an effective political slogan , but didn ’ t really provide any policy prescriptions to guide Republicans .
So when they won control of Washington in 2016 , Republicans realized that there were deep divisions within their party about what to do . Some of their own members were uncomfortable totally rolling back a law that , like it or not , had extended health coverage to 20 million Americans . Others were committed to the full repeal that they had been promising . Bridging that gap proved impossible .
“ There really wasn ’ t a robust and serious conversation about what is the conservative or Republican solution to health care policy , ” Dan Holler , who oversaw the repeal debate for Heritage Action for America , told me . “ There was really no consensus within the Republican Party on where to go forward . ”
As Doug Holtz-Eakin , president of the American Action Forum , said , with a hint of hyperbole , you could repeal all of Obamacare and then reinstate it minus , say , the independent payment advisory board designed to keep Medicare costs under control — and that would technically be repealing and replacing .
But not in the sense that most of the law ’ s opponents had come to believe .
“ I believe that language has become unhelpful and needs to go away , ” Holtz-Eakin said .
This is where this year ’ s devastating failures makes themselves most fully felt . Republicans have not prepared for a reality in which they failed to repeal the 2010 law .
“ We ’ ve had this seven-year period where the whole conversation on the right has been about repeal and replace , ” Avik Roy at the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity , one of the foremost supporters of the bills that Congress considered this year , said . “ There was no plan B on what to do if repeal and replace were to fail . ”
That opinion is not universally shared . Michael Cannon , with the libertarian Cato Institute , told me that there is another way to view the Senate ’ s failure : Republicans were a few votes away from substantially rolling back Obamacare , a result that he himself did not believe was possible back when the law was passed .
Whether it ’ s in the new fiscal year , or the year after that , or whenever , Cannon sees it as a binary choice : Repeal Obamacare or fix it . The latter , he said , would be a betrayal by Republicans .
“ They either keep trying to repeal Obamacare and they ’ re closer than most people acknowledge . They were really only a few votes away , ” he said . “ The other option is to try to fix Obamacare . If Republicans do that , they are going to be alienating a huge chunk of their political base . ”
Everybody agrees there was a lack of consensus in the “ repeal and replace ” plans , but , given the divisions on what to do now , that yields very different ideas about where to go from here .
Robust repeal is still the goal for a few . Others are focusing on a narrower approach , largely working in the confines of Obamacare . Some know what they are trying to stop , like significant funding being poured into Obamacare ’ s markets to stabilize them .
“ We know what we don ’ t want to see , ” Marie Fishpaw , director of domestic policy studies at the Heritage Foundation , told me . “ We don ’ t want to see any bailout of a program we believe is fundamentally flawed . ”
Roy described his ideal end state as one similar to the Swiss system : Universal coverage , through private insurance and subsidization , but without that country ’ s individual mandate or overly prescriptive federal mandates for benefits .
Still , there were some shared visions . Any wonk on the right will talk about equalizing the tax code by capping the unlimited tax break for employer-based insurance and dramatically expanding health savings accounts . Everybody wants more power returned to the states . Everybody is concerned about reining in the costs of the Medicare and Medicaid programs over the long term .
Health care costs in particular are a unifying theme — an issue sometimes but not exclusively tied to Obamacare . Holtz-Eakin sketched out an agenda that focused on changing how health care is delivered in the United States and increasing competition in the delivery system , rather than an obsessive focus on coverage .
“ Insurance is a way of shifting around the national health care bill from people who incur to the people who pay it . The real issue is the underlying bill , ” he said . “ It ’ s actually the practice and the conduct of the delivery system that drives people crazy . It ’ s not like the rest of the economy where consumer sovereignty still matters . ”
3 ) Maybe focus more on small reforms than big ones
One of the ironies of Congress ’ s attempts to repeal Obamacare this year was they ended up crafting a bill that aimed to be as comprehensive as possible — even adding a fundamental overhaul of Medicaid to the mix — after years of slamming Obamacare for being a huge bill that nobody fully understood when it was passed .
That ’ s led some conservatives to conclude that one of the fundamental mistakes made by Republicans this year was pursuing a single bill and conservatives would do well to return to a more modest approach that they had long promised .
“ Health care reform is not a bill . It ’ s a process . It ’ ll be an ongoing process , ” Holtz-Eakin said .
Even Cannon , maybe the most uncompromising Obamacare opponent , agreed — so long as the incrementalism moved in the right direction .
Sen. Ted Cruz ’ s proposal to let non-Obamacare plans back on the marketplaces would be , from his point of view , an improvement that is not a comprehensive bill . But the kind of Obamacare stabilization package that was discussed by Senate Republicans and Democrats , while also a relatively narrow piece of health policymaking , would not .
“ Incrementalism is easier than wholesale change , ” Cannon said . “ I think there are incremental steps you can take . The problem is that most of the incrementalism Republicans are discussing now is incrementalism in the wrong direction , incrementally more money being thrown at Obamacare , which is not gon na solve anything . ”
Others argue that there is a place for big bills . Roy noted that Obamacare only passed as it did , and health care providers only accepted provisions like Medicare reimbursement cuts that they would oppose in isolation , because the law ’ s many pieces were interconnected .
“ I think there is a role and virtue for comprehensive health care reform . Certain types of reforms only work in concert with other reforms , ” he said . “ The big problems with our health care system are gon na be really hard to solve with incremental reform . You really need to be more ambitious . ”
Bipartisan health care talks , with a very small scope , were underway in the Senate this month , though they were scuttled when Republicans decided to try repeal one more time . There was the clear outline for a deal , however , and some conservatives believe that is the only path forward . Seven years of scorched earth have left Obamacare nonetheless the law of the land . Republicans wasted their first eight months in office in a partisan pursuit of repealing it .
A hyper-polarized health care debate has left conservatives with Obamacare still in place , even if they believe it is still struggling , and their own plan suffered a scathing defeat without Democratic votes .
“ The political process and our constitutional structure is crying out for a serious , not superficial , bipartisan negotiations around health care , ” Jim Capretta , resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute , told me .
Without it , he said , health care will continue in this uncertain limbo : Obamacare is the law of the land , but its Republican stewards are categorically opposed to it . That reality risks disaster for the law and its beneficiaries — disaster that could bounce back onto Republicans if the American people blame the party in power .
“ Until there is some kind of bipartisan negotiation and agreement that builds more consensus , the instability we ’ ve witnessed will continue , ” Capretta said . “ The best way out is to try to force some kind of bipartisan negotiation to try to get the best deal [ Republicans ] can and call it a day . ”
Holtz-Eakin , as he advocated for the more incremental approach , said Republicans should “ go back to targeted reforms — starting out with some things that are much more bipartisan . ”
Here again , though , there is division . Some conservatives are deeply skeptical that Democrats , fresh off a huge political victory and edging more toward an even bigger government role in securing coverage for all Americans , are willing to engage in any major health care negotiations with Republicans .
“ I ’ m not sure how realistic or plausible that is , ” Heritage ’ s Holler said . “ My sense is Democrats sense they have an opportunity to push this debate closer to single payer than they ever have . I think they ’ ll be loath to take their foot off the pedal . ”
5 ) Give people time to adjust to a post-repeal world
There is certainly exhaustion in Congress when it comes to health care . That ’ s true outside of Capitol Hill as well , to some extent . Conservatives have been through a head-spinning series of ups and downs this year : the pulled House vote in the spring , the House bill passing , John McCain ’ s dramatic slaying of the Senate bill in July and the mad frenzy around Graham-Cassidy this month .
“ People were so stunned by the unraveling of everything so rapidly , ” Roy said . “ People are not really sure how to think about this stuff . ”
The work never stops , of course . But it might need to change .
“ There ’ s no permanent victory . There ’ s no permanent defeat , ” Fishpaw told me . “ We have a very clear definition of the problem , and we ’ re returning to the basics of where we agree . ”
Roy set the ( early and admittedly arbitrary ) deadline of six months from now , March 2018 . That would be the time perhaps to judge whether conservatives have started to move their health care conversation forward again .
“ Did Republicans and conservatives make progress in thinking about health care , or are they playing the same record they ’ ve been playing since 2010 ? ” he said . “ I think that ’ s a good test . ”
Then again , other Obamacare opponents , particularly those still hoping for repeal , warn against framing the debate in such a way .
“ That ’ s a frustration I have with a lot of conservatives saying it ’ s not gon na happen , ” Cannon said . “ Look , pal , if you say it ’ s not gon na happen then it won ’ t because you ’ re framing political reality right now , whether you know it or not . ”
So here , yet again , the post-repeal reality is still shaking out . Conservatives are reconciling themselves to a world without Obamacare repeal . They themselves don ’ t yet know what it looks like . Time will tell .","After seven years of promises, seven years of warnings that Obamacare was perhaps the worst law that had ever been written, Republicans finally got their chance to repeal it.

2) Figure out what the conservative goals are

Everybody agrees there was a lack of consensus in the “repeal and replace” plans, but, given the divisions on what to do now, that yields very different ideas about where to go from here.

Robust repeal is still the goal for a few. Others are focusing on a narrower approach, largely working in the confines of Obamacare. Some know what they are trying to stop, like significant funding being poured into Obamacare’s markets to stabilize them.

4) Decide if it’s time to work with Democrats

Bipartisan health care talks, with a very small scope, were underway in the Senate this month, though they were scuttled when Republicans decided to try repeal one more time.

Some conservatives are deeply skeptical that Democrats, fresh off a huge political victory and edging more toward an even bigger government role in securing coverage for all Americans, are willing to engage in any major health care negotiations with Republicans.

“I’m not sure how realistic or plausible that is,” Heritage’s Holler said. “My sense is Democrats sense they have an opportunity to push this debate closer to single payer than they ever have. I think they’ll be loath to take their foot off the pedal.”

5) Give people time to adjust to a post-repeal world

There is certainly exhaustion in Congress when it comes to health care. That’s true outside of Capitol Hill as well, to some extent. Conservatives have been through a head-spinning series of ups and downs this year: the pulled House vote in the spring, the House bill passing, John McCain’s dramatic slaying of the Senate bill in July and the mad frenzy around Graham-Cassidy this month.

“People were so stunned by the unraveling of everything so rapidly,” Roy said. “People are not really sure how to think about this stuff.”

The work never stops, of course. But it might need to change.

“There’s no permanent victory. There’s no permanent defeat,” Fishpaw told me. “We have a very clear definition of the problem, and we’re returning to the basics of where we agree.”

Roy set the (early and admittedly arbitrary) deadline of six months from now, March 2018. That would be the time perhaps to judge whether conservatives have started to move their health care conversation forward again.

“Did Republicans and conservatives make progress in thinking about health care, or are they playing the same record they’ve been playing since 2010?” he said. “I think that’s a good test.”

Then again, other Obamacare opponents, particularly those still hoping for repeal, warn against framing the debate in such a way.

“That’s a frustration I have with a lot of conservatives saying it’s not gonna happen,” Cannon said. “Look, pal, if you say it’s not gonna happen then it won’t because you’re framing political reality right now, whether you know it or not.”

So here, yet again, the post-repeal reality is still shaking out. Conservatives are reconciling themselves to a world without Obamacare repeal. They themselves don’t yet know what it looks like. Time will tell.",www.vox.com,left,A6zif8YmkETGlk98

WASHINGTON ( AP ) — Testifying in defiance of President Donald Trump ’ s ban , former U.S . Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch told House impeachment investigators Friday that Trump himself had pressured the State Department to oust her from her post and get her out of the country .
Yovanovitch told lawmakers investigating Trump ’ s dealings with Ukraine that there was a “ concerted campaign ” against her based on “ unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives . ”
The diplomat was recalled from Kyiv as Rudy Giuliani — who is Trump ’ s personal attorney and has no official role in the U.S. government — pressed Ukrainian officials to investigate baseless corruption allegations against Democrat Joe Biden and his son Hunter , who was involved with a gas company there .
Yovanovitch testified behind closed doors Friday for more than nine hours as part of the House Democrats ’ impeachment investigation . Her prepared remarks were obtained by The ███ . She left without answering questions .
New York Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney , a Democrat , said Yovanovitch occasionally had to leave the room because she was overcome with emotion as she was “ recounting how she was thrown to the wolves ” in Ukraine .
“ It is clear to me that she was fired because she was a thorn in the side of those who sought to use the Ukrainian government for their own political and financial gain - and that includes President Trump , ” Maloney said .
Lawmakers leaving the meeting would not provide specifics from the confidential deposition . But they indicated that Yovanovitch was providing information that would help with the impeachment inquiry .
“ It was compelling , it was impactful , it was powerful and I just feel grateful for the opportunity to have received that information , ” said Democratic Rep. Denny Heck , who flew in from Washington state for the interview . He said the eight hours he was there “ went like a New York second . ”
Yovanovitch “ set a very powerful , courageous example , ” said Democratic Rep. Tom Malinowski of New Jersey .

Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio defended Yovanovitch ’ s removal from Ukraine , saying the president is entitled to have the ambassador he wants .
The former ambassador said she was fired from her post after insisting that Giuliani ’ s requests to Ukrainian officials for investigations be relayed through official channels , according to a former diplomat who has spoken with her . That former diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose the private conversation .

Trump has forbidden all government employees to cooperate , and Yovanovitch remains employed by the State Department . She is doing a fellowship at Georgetown University .

The State Department traditionally relies on mutual legal assistance treaties , under which U.S. and foreign officials agree to exchange evidence and information in criminal investigations .
In her statement to lawmakers , Yovanovitch said that “ false narratives ” had resulted from “ an unfortunate alliance between Ukrainians who continue to operate within a corrupt system , and Americans who either did not understand that corrupt system , or who may have chosen , for their own purposes , to ignore it . ”
She said she had only “ minimal contacts ” with Giuliani — three that she could recall — and none related to “ the events at issue. ” She speculated that “ individuals who have been named in the press as contacts of Mr. Giuliani ” may have believed their personal financial ambitions were stymied by U.S. anti-corruption policy .
Two Florida businessmen tied to Giuliani were arrested on Thursday and are facing federal charges of campaign finance violations . An indictment filed in the case alleges that the men , who were raising campaign funds for a U.S. congressman , asked him for help in removing Yovanovitch , at least partly at the request of Ukrainian government officials .

On Oct. 31, 2018, Biden came to Illinois to headline a get-out-the vote rally for Underwood at the Kane County Fairgrounds in St. Charles. That boost came just days before the election in which Underwood pulled off her upset and flipped a long-held GOP congressional seat. Later that day, Biden headed to East St. Louis to headline a rally for the 2018 statewide ticket, led by now-Gov. J.B. Pritzker.

Biden campaign manager Greg Schultz said in a statement, “We are grateful for Congressman Schneider’s support and for his leadership on key issues. He knows how to win in tough districts, a trusted champion for middle class families, a powerful voice on how to solve pressing global challenges. As we work to restore respected and dignified leadership on the world stage, we know that Congressman Schneider will be a valuable member of Team Joe with his foreign policy leadership and expertise.”",www.chicago.suntimes.com,left,hAmbtdN2lLKWMvLs

Frustrated lawmakers in both parties are complaining that congressional leaders have made zero progress since Tuesday, when Trump stunned even his fellow Republicans by boasting that he would take the blame for the closure of a dozen federal agencies if he doesn’t get money for his border wall.

Lawmakers say there is no public plan to prevent a partial government shuttering. And no secret plan either.

The House isn’t planning to return until the night of Dec. 19 — leaving only about 72 hours to reach a border wall deal that has eluded both parties for months.

Democrats say they’re waiting on Republicans, and Republicans say they’re waiting on Trump.

With one week to go, the GOP must find an agreement that can satisfy both Trump and Democratic leaders, who have only grown more emboldened since their sit-down with Trump.

“I’ve not heard of any Republican who’s sitting down and figuring out how to get this through. There’s no plan,” said Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.).

Yet there’s no indication that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer are even talking. Senators in both parties said they were unaware of anything cooking between the two leaders, and the often-chatty Schumer was tight-lipped when asked if there were ongoing discussions. “No comment,” he said Thursday.

The House was expected to make the first move this week. House GOP leaders had planned to try and pass a bill giving $5 billion for Trump's wall and force Senate Democrats to reject it under the chamber's 60-vote threshold.

But with morale and attendance low in the House following a brutal election loss last month, Republicans left Washington empty-handed, with all eyes now focused on the Senate.

“It’s just all politics and theatrics,” said Rep Tom Cole (R-Okla.). He said leaders of both parties have the same thought going into next week’s final round of negotiations: “Somebody has to lose, and it’s going to not be them.”

It’s not a very serious proposal, but the worldview behind it is dangerous.

On Thursday, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) and Senator Ed Markey (D., Mass.) introduced what many news outlets described as “legislation” for the Green New Deal, a wildly ambitious plan to eliminate the American fossil-fuel industry within a decade or so. It’s worth noting that it’s not legislation as people normally understand the term. It’s a resolution titled “Recognizing the duty of the Federal Government to create a Green New Deal.” In other words, even if it passed — a considerable if — nothing would really happen.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi isn’t taking it too seriously. She didn’t put Ocasio-Cortez on the new Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, and when asked about the resolution, she was dismissive.

First , there were no government shutdowns or defaults on the national debt .

Medicare Reform : Known as the `` Doc Fix '' bill , this measure permanently ended automatic Medicare payment cuts to physicians .

Immigration : The Senate managed to pass a comprehensive immigration overhaul package in 2013 , but attempts to move the legislation through the House failed . Efforts to resurrect immigration legislation have since languished .
Tax Reform : After the midterm election , corporate tax reform was seen as a possible area Republicans and Democrats could work together on .

When Republicans took over both chambers of Congress in January, party leaders vowed they would prove to the country that Republicans could govern. They promised to stop with the self-made crises, such as government shutdowns, and rack up legislative accomplishments. So in the first year of a GOP-controlled Congress in nearly a decade, how well did Republicans prove they can govern?

First, there were no government shutdowns or defaults on the national debt. Immediately after the midterm election in 2014, both Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner promised there wouldn't be any shutdowns or defaults on their watch. Turns out they made good on that promise this year.

But Democrats aren't exactly congratulating them for it. ""That's like saying, 'You know, they didn't blow the top off the Capitol, so clearly Republican leadership is in touch with America.' No, it takes more than that,"" said Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois.

Nonetheless, it is fair to say that the widely held assumption Congress gets nothing done doesn't exactly fit this year. There was an uptick in bipartisan activity in this Republican-controlled Congress in 2015, but if you ask Democrats why that was, they'll say it's because they were a more cooperative minority than Republicans were when Democrats controlled the Senate — and that they cooperated on legislation that bolstered Democratic goals.

Whether or not keeping the government open counts as an accomplishment, here are eight legislative matters Congress did address in 2015 — and some issues that remain unresolved:

Bipartisan Legislative Accomplishments

Trillion-Dollar Government Funding Bill: Right before they split for the holidays, lawmakers passed a trillion-dollar spending bill that will keep the government open until the end of next September. The measure also beefed up cybersecurity and renewed a health care program for Sept. 11 first responders. It also made changes to the visa waiver program so people who have traveled to Iraq, Iran, Syria and Sudan in the past five years will face greater scrutiny if they wish to enter the U.S.

Tax Extenders: Paired with the government spending bill was a measure containing hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks. Year after year, Congress has had to extend dozens of tax breaks that expire. In this measure, lawmakers made permanent the most popular tax breaks, such as the $1,000 child tax credit, the earned income tax credit for low- and moderate-income workers, and the research and development tax credit.

Two-Year Budget Agreement: Right before Boehner left office, he managed to reach a two-year budget deal with the White House and other congressional leaders. The agreement suspends the debt ceiling through March 2017 and increases spending by $80 billion over the next two years — an increase that's split evenly between defense and domestic programs.

No Child Left Behind Rewrite: Congress easily passed legislation to rewrite the 2002 No Child Left Behind Act. Federally mandated math and reading tests will continue, but the new law cedes greater authority to states, rather than the federal government, to figure out how to use the test results in evaluating schools.

Five-Year Transportation Bill: Congress passed its first long-term bill in a decade to fund roads, bridges and mass transit systems. The measure does not raise the gas tax, currently at 18.4 cents per gallon, but found other sources of funding — such as changing customs fees and dipping into funds from the Federal Reserve.

Ended The NSA's Bulk Surveillance Program: Lawmakers passed the USA Freedom Act, which ended the government's bulk collection of phone records. Passage of the measure came after Republican senator and presidential candidate Rand Paul of Kentucky forced a two-day shutdown of the bulk collection program.

Trade Promotion Authority: Congress approved a measure to give the president expedited authority to enter a trade deal with 11 other Pacific Rim countries. Attention now turns to the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, which Congress is expected to consider next year — possibly after the election is over.

Medicare Reform: Known as the ""Doc Fix"" bill, this measure permanently ended automatic Medicare payment cuts to physicians. Under a law from the late 1990s, Medicare payments to doctors would be cut to keep the program's budget in check. Since then, Congress had failed every year to figure out a long-term solution to the problem.

Unresolved Issues

Still, so many issues remain unresolved — not because lawmakers think they're unimportant but because partisan divisions on these ideological issues are so deep, they can't find common ground. Congress seems happy to take these issues to the voters in 2016.

Guns: After a spate of gun-related tragedies in 2015, Democrats vowed to push for gun control legislation, such as measures to expand background checks and prohibit individuals whose names are on terrorist watch lists from purchasing firearms. Both measures failed in the Senate in 2015, as in past years.

Immigration: The Senate managed to pass a comprehensive immigration overhaul package in 2013, but attempts to move the legislation through the House failed. Efforts to resurrect immigration legislation have since languished.

Tax Reform: After the midterm election, corporate tax reform was seen as a possible area Republicans and Democrats could work together on.

Washington (CNN) - A week and a half into a partial government shutdown and one week before a crucial deadline to raise the nation's debt ceiling, new polls indicate that Americans are angry and are blaming both political parties for the impasse.

Sixty percent of people questioned in an NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey released Thursday say if given the chance to vote to defeat every single member of Congress, including their own representative, they would.

Some Capitol Hill Republicans have envisioned the nightmare scenario for 2017 , and it goes like this : No ­ObamaCare repeal . No tax reform . No trillion-dollar infrastructure package . No border wall .
It ’ s a striking change from the period after Election Day , when GOP leaders vowed that the new unified Republican government would “ go big , go bold ” and deliver for the American people .
While many Republicans hold out hope the ­ObamaCare repeal bill will be revived , skeptics say the GOP infighting during last month ’ s healthcare collapse may have poisoned the well for future big-ticket legislative deals .
“ I don ’ t see how you put a coalition together to deal with tax reform , ” said one House Republican who is close to Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis Ryan Retirees should say 'no thanks ' to Romney 's Social Security plan California Governor Newsom and family dress as 2020 Democrats for Halloween DC 's liaison to rock ' n ' roll MORE ( R-Wis. ) and his leadership team . “ Unless we can bridge this divide and get a win on the board , I don ’ t know how we pull the other things together , all the other big things we got ta do . ”
Despite some signs of life , healthcare talks between the White House and centrist and conservative holdouts did not result in a deal before Congress began a two-week April recess .
And the recriminations among Republicans only seem to be getting nastier .

Some Capitol Hill Republicans have envisioned the nightmare scenario for 2017, and it goes like this: No ­ObamaCare repeal. No tax reform. No trillion-dollar infrastructure package. No border wall.

It’s a striking change from the period after Election Day, when GOP leaders vowed that the new unified Republican government would “go big, go bold” and deliver for the American people.

While many Republicans hold out hope the ­ObamaCare repeal bill will be revived, skeptics say the GOP infighting during last month’s healthcare collapse may have poisoned the well for future big-ticket legislative deals.

“I don’t see how you put a coalition together to deal with tax reform,” said one House Republican who is close to Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis Ryan Retirees should say 'no thanks' to Romney's Social Security plan California Governor Newsom and family dress as 2020 Democrats for Halloween DC's liaison to rock 'n' roll MORE (R-Wis.) and his leadership team. “Unless we can bridge this divide and get a win on the board, I don’t know how we pull the other things together, all the other big things we gotta do.”

Despite some signs of life, healthcare talks between the White House and centrist and conservative holdouts did not result in a deal before Congress began a two-week April recess.

And the recriminations among Republicans only seem to be getting nastier.

Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), the head of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, “is a pathological liar who isn’t interested in getting to yes,” one House GOP colleague of Meadows told The Hill in a fit of frustration over the stalled health negotiations.

But Rep. Raúl Labrador (R-Idaho), a fellow Freedom Caucus leader, defended Meadows as “a man of great integrity.” “When members of Congress resort to personal attacks while hiding behind anonymity,” Labrador said, “it’s usually because their position is weak in the first place and they are getting heat back home for not keeping the promises that they made to their constituents.”

Well, in keeping with the polarized politics on Capitol Hill, I have one winner for Republicans and a very different winner for Democrats.

Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., perfectly embody the polarization that prevents Congress from getting anything done on the nation’s most pressing issues, from immigration to stopping gun massacres to fighting the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS).

This dysfunctional Congress deserves its dismal 13 percent approval rating from the American people. The Republican majorities in the House and Senate reached a new nadir in broken politics by inviting a foreign leader, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to use the Congress as a setting to disrespect the American president back in March. They acted without first consulting with the White House.

And then there was the refusal to hold confirmation hearings on the president’s nominees for judicial posts or to the Foreign Service.

Congressional Republicans have made it their everyday practice to obstruct initiatives from the twice-elected leader of the nation. That includes their recent undercutting of any efforts to deal with global warming, which are being negotiated by the president and more than a hundred other world leaders.

The GOP antipathy toward President Obama is not new, however. The bigger change is the out-of-control elbowing inside the Republican tent that came to define the year on Capitol Hill.

Republicans in the House successfully launched a coup earlier this year against then-Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), forcing out a man who is by any measure a strong conservative but still not conservative enough for the party’s far right. The same right wing then derailed Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) because they saw him as too close to Boehner.

The eventual winner after several weeks of embarrassing party infighting was the 2012 GOP vice presidential candidate and former Ways and Means committee chair, Ryan. But Ryan won without winning the official endorsement of the rebellious Freedom Caucus, who dictated Boehner’s departure.

All this led the new Speaker, in his very first speech as the top Republican in the House, to stare failure in the face.

“Let’s be frank: The House is broken,” said Speaker Ryan. “We are not solving problems. We are adding to them.”

And that is from a loyal conservative.

The real story on Ryan’s elevation is that he is by far the most conservative Speaker in recent times. His voting record is far to the right of Boehner and other GOP Speakers of the current era, from Newt Gingrich (Ga.) to Denny Hastert (Ill.).

Don’t forget: Ryan rose to prominence as the defiant right-winger who proposed, as top Republican on the budget committee, to change Medicare from a guaranteed health care program for the elderly to a limited, untested voucher plan. He also backed massive tax breaks for the wealthy and large corporations.

In almost 17 years in Congress, Ryan has been a reliable opponent of abortion rights and gay rights, and he supported President George W. Bush’s push to privatize Social Security.

This year, the 74-year-old Sanders succeeded in channeling the same energy outside the halls of Congress. Democratic voters still strongly back former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for the party’s 2016 nomination. But the unleashed, defiant roar of the party in 2015 can be heard at Sanders’s political rallies.

He has been a political sensation, all year long, in every corner of the nation. He attracts energized, loud crowds by identifying the Republican majority in Congress as the tool of big business and extremely wealthy Americans including Charles and David Koch, and other plutocrats. Sanders’s anger at the power of big money is resonating among left-wingers looking to identify those responsible for rigging the economic and political system against workers, unions, students, immigrants and minorities.

“He [Sanders] is where the heart – the economic heart and soul of the party is right now… And he’s got the outsider thing, which is so big this year,” New York Times columnist David Brooks said recently.

Sanders and Ryan are the year’s political leaders in Congress because they captured that “outsider thing” for the left and the right.

LOSER: Boehner

Boehner just can't catch a break. He might have one of the least-wanted jobs in the nation. He tried to appease House conservatives by demanding the president's health care law be defunded. All he got in return was a government shutdown for which the country largely blames him.

LOSERS: Obama and Boehner

Once again, the President and Boehner were unable to usher negotiations through the finish line. They have a pathetic record in solving government budget battles. Ultimately, other key players had to finalize a deal once again.

WINNER AND LOSER: Cruz

The Texas Republican's 21-hour talk-a-thon on the Senate floor, days before the shutdown began, had little practical impact on getting rid of Obamacare. While it did excite conservatives, it hurt his standing among his Senate colleagues. If Cruz wants to be an effective senator, that will hurt him. If he wants to win the 2016 Republican nomination, that could help him among the most conservative wing of the party.

If he wants to win the 2016 Republican nomination, that could help him among the most conservative wing of the party. Evidence of that came at the annual Values Voter Summit in Washington. Cruz easily won a straw poll surveying the activists' preferences for a 2016 presidential run.

WINNER: Ryan

He simultaneously opened the negotiating door with the President and effectively brought House Republicans closer to a unified position. But conservative activists were not pleased. Ryan, who was once a conservative hero as recently as one year ago, finished dead last in the Values Voter Summit straw poll.

Sen. Harry Reid vs. Sen. Mitch McConnell

WINNER: Reid

The Senate majority leader didn't blink. He engaged in high-stakes negotiations and refused to accept a deal that would cut government spending or dissect Obamacare. Ultimately, the negotiations took place on his terms.

LOSER: McConnell

While the Senate minority leader helped to pull the country back from the brink, it might have hurt his standing with the tea party, which has always been skeptical of him. He is also embroiled in a re-election bid in Kentucky, where he has a primary challenger who is billing himself as a true conservative and a Democratic challenger who is labeling him as too extreme.

Tea party vs. Republicans v s . Democrats

WINNER: Democrats

When the focus is on their politically fractured Republican rivals, it's easy to appear united and (mostly) innocent. But Democrats didn't come out of this scot-free. A : DemocratsWhen the focus is on their politically fractured Republican rivals, it's easy to appear united and (mostly) innocent. But Democrats didn't come out of this scot-free. A CNN/ORC poll earlier this month found that 57% of respondents were angry at Democrats for the way they were handling the shutdown.

2016: Chris Christie vs. Hillary Clinton vs. Joe Biden

In a meeting with the Philadelphia Inquirer editorial board, Christie said, ""If I was in the Senate right now, I'd kill myself.""

WINNER: Clinton

Clinton largely stayed silent throughout this debate. Why say a word when it could come back to haunt her in an election, especially when she doesn't have a direct role in the outcome?

LOSER: Biden

For the Vice President, it's a different story. It appeared as if he was nowhere near the negotiating table, but he's an active member of the government. It's also a stark contrast to where he sat during the last major budget battles, when he and McConnell brought the deals past the finish line. This time, he didn't say a word.

United State s vs. the world

LOSER: The United States

While the United States has spent the past four years lecturing European nations about their economic state, its government has shown that it should not point fingers.

WINNER: China

A league of her own

WINNER: Sen. Susan Collins

The moderate Maine Republican refused to wait for political leaders to announce a deal, and she began talking to senators on both sides of the aisle. Although her talks didn't result in the final agreement, it precipitated talks between Senate leaders after Boehner and Obama's efforts hit a brick wall.",www.cnn.com,left,zFGimQoneETox2Ep

Issa kept his focus on the Justice Department , clarifying that he has no evidence the White House was involved in any Fast and Furious cover-up . But he repeatedly said Congress is trying to get to the bottom of why the Justice Department `` lied '' about the operation .
The comments underscored the apparent momentum among majority House Republicans behind the contempt push , following a committee contempt vote against Holder along party lines this past week . That vote proceeded after Holder and Republicans were unable to reach an agreement over subpoenaed documents pertaining to the Obama administration 's Fast and Furious discussions .
Issa said Sunday it 's possible the vote could be delayed or even `` eliminated '' if the administration produces the subpoenaed documents the House is seeking . He noted the entire schedule is at the discretion of House Speaker John Boehner .
`` But we have to see the documents first , '' he said .
Barring such a resolution , Issa and his allies are teeing up a major election-year clash this coming week between the Executive and Legislative branches , and between Democrats and Republicans .
President Obama intervened this past week , invoking executive privilege to protect the documents in question , but Republicans dismissed the claim and proceeded with the contempt vote . On the sidelines , minority House Democrats are pleading with Republicans take a step back and work out the document dispute without the threat of contempt . At the same time , both sides are antagonizing each other at the dais and in the press over what Democrats claim has become a political `` witch hunt . ''
Rep. Elijah Cummings , R-Md. , ranking Democrat on the oversight committee , told `` Fox News Sunday '' that the confrontation was entirely avoidable .
`` I think it 's extremely unfortunate , '' he said . `` The attorney general has made it clear that he is willing to work with this Congress . ''
Cummings called on Boehner to intervene and try to reach an agreement with Holder that involves turning over some documents while also halting the contempt proceedings .
`` I think that we have a duty ... at this critical moment to get the documents , '' he said . `` I know we can get them . It 's just a matter of sitting down and talking to Holder . ''
Cummings suggested the course of the committee 's investigation has lost sight of one of the major reasons for the probe -- the death of Border Patrol agent Brian Terry , whose murder scene included weapons from the Fast and Furious operation .
But Issa defended the escalation , saying the committee is trying to obtain critical documents to help explain why Congress was initially told -- incorrectly -- in February 2011 that the government did not knowingly let guns `` walk '' across the U.S.-Mexico border . The department later issued a correction to that statement .
`` We , in fact , are simply trying to get to the truth when we were told a lie , '' Issa said . `` It 's about the cover-up . ''

“ You ’ ve got to satisfy two problems , one of which is the legality of it and the other is the practicality of it , ” Clyburn said in an interview last month .
Clyburn highlighted just one of the thorny questions a reparations panel would have to resolve , noting that mixed-raced people , following the Civil War , had access to certain schooling that black former slaves did not .
“ Are mulattoes descendants of slaves ? Yes , they are . But they got a leg up , ” he said . “ So I don ’ t know how you can fairly deal with that . That ’ s the practicality part . ”
Clyburn is instead pushing for direct investments in the nation ’ s poorest regions . Known as the 10-20-30 plan , Clyburn ’ s model operates under the simple premise that federal development dollars are best spent in the areas of greatest need . Under his formula , federal programs must direct at least 10 percent of their funds to communities where at least 20 percent of the population has lived below the poverty line for at least the last 30 years .
On Wednesday , Clyburn and Booker introduced legislation that would expand that model , which already governs parts of federal spending , to a larger swath of programs .
“ While genius is spread equally across ZIP codes , opportunity is not , ” Booker said .
Jackson Lee ’ s bill has the same number adopted by Conyers : H.R . 40 . That ’ s a nod to “ 40 acres and a mule , ” the unfulfilled promise that Union leaders made to newly freed slaves in 1865 .
She pushed back on the suggestion that disagreements in the Democratic caucus were delaying her legislation .
“ There ’ s no hold up . You don ’ t move legislation overnight . I would never say there is a hold up , ” Jackson Lee said . “ The Judiciary Committee has been working on this . And we are very excited of the Speaker taking note of H.R . 40 . ”
The proposal would establish a committee charged with studying the institution of slavery in the U.S. — from its inception until the end of the Civil War in 1865 — and recommend ways to compensate living descendants .
CBC members pointed out that the idea of reparations is being discussed on the 2020 campaign trail because grass-roots activists are pressing candidates and congressional leaders to take up the issue .
In one example , Clyburn was pressed last month by an activist representing the group American Descendants of Slavery .
“ Tell Nancy Pelosi to cut the check , ” the activist said , in a video posted to Twitter .

Cedric Richmond Cedric Levon RichmondTwo former Congressional Black Caucus chairmen back Biden Election security funds caught in crosshairs of spending debate Lawmakers weigh responses to rash of ransomware attacks MORE ( D-La . ) , the immediate past chairman of the CBC , is a supporter of reparations and the idea of establishing a commission .

But sometimes you let the experts tell you what they think it should be , ” he said . “ I think the commission is good because we need to see what the experts say would be the correct remedy . ”","House legislation to form a commission to study whether black Americans should receive reparations for slavery is getting a significant boost from Democrats on the presidential campaign trail.

The support from presidential candidates highlights how the idea of reparations is spiking in popularity in Democratic circles — particularly as a large field of candidates jockeys for support from African-American voters.

An aide said Wednesday that, if acted upon, the bill would move first through Nadler’s committee before reaching the floor.

“We tried to posture this legislation at the highest level of thought and seriousness. There is no humor. There is no request in the bill for a check or a pot of gold,” Jackson Lee told The Hill as she headed to a CBC meeting in the Capitol.

“I do think it has traction. People are not hesitating to openly support it and push for it. I think we have a very good chance of having a hearing some point.”

The prominence of the issue among 2020 contenders has lent momentum to the effort, he said, “but it’s also a recognition that Africans who were brought here in bondage — that should not have occurred.”

“This country owes a lot [to the descendants of those Africans]. … As to what the remedy is, we need to look at it,” Thompson said, comparing the issue to the Japanese internments of World War II. Congress, decades later, passed legislation offering a formal apology — and $20,000 — to each of the surviving victims of that campaign.

“Obviously, slavery was a greater internment, and so it’s something that has to be looked at, absolutely,” Thompson said.

Not all Democrats back direct reparations payments.

The issue is divisive, and ahead of an election where Republicans and Democrats will be battling over the Rust Belt states of Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Ohio, it has the potential to split Democrats from white working-class votes.

A bill to fund the federal government for the coming weeks did not receive the required 60 votes by the deadline of midnight on Friday .
President Trump accused the Democrats of putting politics above the interests of the American people .
Negotiations in both houses of Congress continued on Saturday , Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said the chamber would be back in session on Sunday to try to end the impasse .
The White House budget chief has expressed optimism that a resolution will be found before Monday .
But if not , hundreds of thousands of federal workers face the prospect of no work and shuttered offices at the start of the working week .
The last government shutdown was in 2013 , and lasted for 16 days .
This is the first time a government shutdown has happened while one party , the Republicans , controls both Congress and the White House .
The vote on Friday was 50-49 , falling far short of the 60 needed to advance the bill . With a 51-seat majority in the Senate , the Republicans did not have enough seats to pass the bill without some support from the Democrats .
They want funding for border security - including the border wall - and immigration reforms , as well as increased military spending .
The Democrats have demanded protection from deportation of more than 700,000 undocumented immigrants who entered the US as children .
The Republicans added a sweetener in the form of a six-year extension to a health insurance programme for children in lower-income families . But Democrats want this programme extended permanently .
Mr Trump accused the Democrats of being `` far more concerned with illegal immigrants than they are with our great military or safety at our dangerous southern border '' .
But the leading Senate Democrat , Chuck Schumer , blamed the president , saying Mr Trump was under pressure from `` hard-right forces within the administration '' .
White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders warned : `` The president will not negotiate on immigration reform until Democrats stop playing games and reopen the government . ''
Republicans are anxious to label this the `` Schumer shutdown '' and , essentially , they 're right . Chuck Schumer and his fellow Democrats ( with the help of a few Republicans ) blocked a bill that would have kept the government open - at least temporarily .
Determining responsibility and apportioning blame , however , are two decidedly different endeavours .
Democrats will argue that they had a deal with the president on their bipartisan compromise that included immigration reform - only to have him back away during that fateful obscenity-laden Oval Office meeting last week . Republicans will frame this as liberals putting undocumented immigrant protections over military readiness and health insurance for poor kids .
The winner of the blame game has yet to be decided . Generally , the loser in these types of showdowns is the party entering the fight with the lowest popularity - bad news for Mr Trump and the Republicans .
The good news , for both sides , is that their political bases will be thrilled they are playing hardball . Midterm election years , like 2018 , tend to encourage this kind of rally-the-base manoeuvres .
Now that the line has been crossed , this could become a protracted , ugly fight .
The US budget must be approved by 1 October - the start of the federal financial year .
But Congress has often failed to meet this deadline and negotiations continue well into the new year , with the previous year 's funding to federal agencies extended on a temporary basis .
Because Congress failed to agree an extension that would have maintained government funding through to 16 February , it means many federal agencies effectively closed for business as of 00:01 on Saturday ( 05:01 GMT ) .
Most staff in the departments of housing , environment , education and commerce will be staying at home on Monday . Half of workers in the treasury , health , defence and transportation departments will also not be going to work .
Visa and passport processing could also be delayed , and some national monuments , including New York 's Statue of Liberty , have already been closed .
But essential services that protect `` life or human property '' will continue , including national security , postal services , air traffic control , inpatient medical services , emergency outpatient medicine , disaster assistance , prisons , taxation and electricity generation .
And the Trump administration said it planned to keep national parks open - their closure in the 2013 shutdown provoked an angry public reaction .
The shutdown began on the first anniversary of President Trump 's inauguration . His trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland , next week has also been called into question .
Many federal employees were forced to take a leave of absence - officially known as being furloughed - during the 16 days of shutdown .
At its peak , some 850,000 employees were off work each day . It cost the government $ 2bn in lost productivity and led to `` significant negative effects on the economy '' , the OMB said at the time .
Donald Trump , interviewed by Fox and Friends at the time , laid the blame for the shutdown with the then president , Barack Obama .","Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Republican Leader Senator Mitch McConnell accused the Democrats of ""irresponsible political games""

Recriminations have begun over the failure of the US Senate to pass a new budget and prevent the shutdown of many federal services.

A bill to fund the federal government for the coming weeks did not receive the required 60 votes by the deadline of midnight on Friday.

President Trump accused the Democrats of putting politics above the interests of the American people.

The Democrats blame him for rejecting bipartisan compromise proposals.

Negotiations in both houses of Congress continued on Saturday, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said the chamber would be back in session on Sunday to try to end the impasse.

The White House budget chief has expressed optimism that a resolution will be found before Monday.

But if not, hundreds of thousands of federal workers face the prospect of no work and shuttered offices at the start of the working week.

The last government shutdown was in 2013, and lasted for 16 days.

Why can the two sides not agree?

This is the first time a government shutdown has happened while one party, the Republicans, controls both Congress and the White House.

The vote on Friday was 50-49, falling far short of the 60 needed to advance the bill. With a 51-seat majority in the Senate, the Republicans did not have enough seats to pass the bill without some support from the Democrats.

They want funding for border security - including the border wall - and immigration reforms, as well as increased military spending.

The Democrats have demanded protection from deportation of more than 700,000 undocumented immigrants who entered the US as children.

The Republicans added a sweetener in the form of a six-year extension to a health insurance programme for children in lower-income families. But Democrats want this programme extended permanently.

Mr Trump accused the Democrats of being ""far more concerned with illegal immigrants than they are with our great military or safety at our dangerous southern border"".

But the leading Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer, blamed the president, saying Mr Trump was under pressure from ""hard-right forces within the administration"".

White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders warned: ""The president will not negotiate on immigration reform until Democrats stop playing games and reopen the government.""

This could be a protracted, ugly fight

Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington

The game of chicken ended with a head-on crash.

Republicans are anxious to label this the ""Schumer shutdown"" and, essentially, they're right. Chuck Schumer and his fellow Democrats (with the help of a few Republicans) blocked a bill that would have kept the government open - at least temporarily.

Determining responsibility and apportioning blame, however, are two decidedly different endeavours.

Democrats will argue that they had a deal with the president on their bipartisan compromise that included immigration reform - only to have him back away during that fateful obscenity-laden Oval Office meeting last week. Republicans will frame this as liberals putting undocumented immigrant protections over military readiness and health insurance for poor kids.

The winner of the blame game has yet to be decided. Generally, the loser in these types of showdowns is the party entering the fight with the lowest popularity - bad news for Mr Trump and the Republicans.

The good news, for both sides, is that their political bases will be thrilled they are playing hardball. Midterm election years, like 2018, tend to encourage this kind of rally-the-base manoeuvres.

Now that the line has been crossed, this could become a protracted, ugly fight.

What is a government shutdown?

The US budget must be approved by 1 October - the start of the federal financial year.

But Congress has often failed to meet this deadline and negotiations continue well into the new year, with the previous year's funding to federal agencies extended on a temporary basis.

Because Congress failed to agree an extension that would have maintained government funding through to 16 February, it means many federal agencies effectively closed for business as of 00:01 on Saturday (05:01 GMT).

Most staff in the departments of housing, environment, education and commerce will be staying at home on Monday. Half of workers in the treasury, health, defence and transportation departments will also not be going to work.

Visa and passport processing could also be delayed, and some national monuments, including New York's Statue of Liberty, have already been closed.

But essential services that protect ""life or human property"" will continue, including national security, postal services, air traffic control, inpatient medical services, emergency outpatient medicine, disaster assistance, prisons, taxation and electricity generation.

And the Trump administration said it planned to keep national parks open - their closure in the 2013 shutdown provoked an angry public reaction.

The shutdown began on the first anniversary of President Trump's inauguration. His trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, next week has also been called into question.

What happened during the 2013 shutdown?

Many federal employees were forced to take a leave of absence - officially known as being furloughed - during the 16 days of shutdown.

At its peak, some 850,000 employees were off work each day. It cost the government $2bn in lost productivity and led to ""significant negative effects on the economy"", the OMB said at the time.

Donald Trump, interviewed by Fox and Friends at the time, laid the blame for the shutdown with the then president, Barack Obama.

WASHINGTON – As the partial government shutdown stretched into its second day, President Trump brought up one of his favorite suggestions to break a congressional logjam: End the Senate rule that requires 60 votes for legislation to pass.

Trump is calling on Republicans to invoke the ""nuclear option"" to try to pass a ""real, long term"" spending bill rather than continue funding the government through a short-term measure.

In the House, Republicans can pass legislation with only their own members because of the size of their majority — and they did so Thursday night to advance a spending bill to keep the government open.

However, the vote fell short in the Senate, where Republicans have a narrow 51-49 majority and passing most legislation requires bipartisan support. Even if the whole party sticks together, they need at least nine Democrats to get on board.

“If ordinary rules prevailed, the majority rules in the Senate, the government would be open as of today,"" Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said, when asked on CNN Sunday about Trump's call to change the rules.

""It also responds to this constant criticism we hear: ‘Oh, you Republicans control the White House and the House and the Senate, why can’t you just fund the government?' "" he continued. ""It takes 60 votes in the Senate. We cannot open the government without Senate Democrats' support.""

But even though the 60-vote threshold makes it difficult for Republicans to pass their priorities, so far, there doesn't seem to be an appetite on either side of the aisle to get rid of the rule.

""The Republican Conference opposes changing the rules on legislation,"" David Popp, who is the spokesman for Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told USA TODAY.

Democrats also objected. ""That would be the end of the Senate as it was originally devised and created going back to our Founding Fathers. We have to acknowledge a respect for the minority,"" Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on ABC.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested Wednesday that President Donald Trump is building his own case for impeachment by continuing to stonewall lawmakers in their demand for testimony and documents from the White House.

“He’s becoming self-impeachable in terms of some of the things he’s doing,” Pelosi (D-Calif.) said during a live interview with The Washington Post.

The speaker has consistently sought to tamp down talk among the Democratic Caucus of impeaching the president, warning that the divisive process should not be taken lightly. On Tuesday and again on Wednesday, she said it was possible that Trump was looking to play on that division, “goading” Democratic lawmakers into initiating impeachment proceedings.

“Every single day, whether it’s obstruction, obstruction, obstruction, obstruction of having people come to the table with facts or ignoring subpoenas. Every single day, the president is making a case,” Pelosi told the Post’s Robert Costa.

The speaker had pointed out a day before that one of the articles of impeachment against President Richard Nixon charged that he obstructed Congress, but on Wednesday she wouldn't commit to that kind of a narrow impeachment push against Trump.

After months of legal wrangling -- and more than 100 days after the release of his report detailing Russia 's attempts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election -- former special counsel Robert Mueller took questions from Capitol Hill lawmakers for hours on Wednesday .
I watched all of it and collected my key takeaways in real time . They 're below .
President Donald Trump and his aides have gone out of their way to paint the President as annoyed but unconcerned about Mueller 's testimony . `` No , I 'm not going to be watching , probably , maybe I 'll see a little bit of it , '' Trump told reporters on Monday in the Oval Office . `` I 'm not going to be watching Mueller because you ca n't take all those bites out of the apple . We had no collusion , no obstruction . ''
Except that Trump 's Twitter feed -- a direct window into how he 's thinking and feeling at any given time -- sent the exact opposite message . By 8:15 a.m. on the east coast , the President had already sent seven tweets about the Mueller hearing , tweets that largely revisited many of his old hobby horses , like this one : `` Why did n't Robert Mueller & his band of 18 Angry Democrats spend any time investigating Crooked Hillary Clinton , Lyin ' & Leakin ' James Comey , Lisa Page and her Psycho lover , Peter S , Andy McCabe , the beautiful Ohr family , Fusion GPS , and many more , including HIMSELF & Andrew W ? ''
Is that the tweet of a man who is entirely unworried about what the former special counsel would say -- and what it might mean for his political future ? Yeah , I do n't think so either .
In his opening statement , Mueller made clear that he would be unable to address anything related to the origins of the counterintelligence investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election or the so-called `` Steele dossier , '' an opposition research document put together by former British spy Christopher Steele .
President Trump has long insisted that the entire investigation -- the initial probe which led to the appointment of the special counsel and all that followed from it -- was illegal because it was based on the Steele document , which contained research that was partially funded by Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee .
Mueller 's affirmation that he would not answer any questions about the genesis of the probe and/or the Steele dossier took a major line of questioning off the table for Republicans .
In that same opening statement , Mueller said he would not address any questions involving Attorney General William Barr or the actions of Congress . That 's a big blow for Democrats , who very much wanted to explore differences in public statements about the special counsel investigation between Mueller and Barr , particularly as it related to how Barr characterized the findings of the report on obstruction .
If Democrats hoped that Mueller would easily bat away Republican attacks -- on him and on his report -- they were sorely disappointed in the opening moments of his testimony . Mueller seemingly contradicted himself ( and the report ) when he told Georgia Rep. Doug Collins , the ranking Republican member on the committee , that collusion and conspiracy were not the same thing .
Mueller also seemed to struggle to hear and/or understand questions from member of both sides as well as to find various references members were making to the Mueller report , asking for questions to be repeated . Democrats viewed the hearing as a chance for the public to hear what the President did ( and did n't do ) from a straight-out-of-central-casting prosecutor . Mueller did n't come across like that .
On Wednesday morning , Trump tweeted this : `` It has been reported that Robert Mueller is saying that he did not apply and interview for the job of FBI Director ( and get turned down ) the day before he was wrongfully appointed Special Counsel . Hope he does n't say that under oath in that we have numerous witnesses to the interview , including the Vice President of the United States ! ''
Except ... under questioning from Republican Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert , Mueller directly contradicted Trump 's version of events . As Gohmert was attacking Mueller 's alleged conflicts of interest , he cited Mueller meeting with Trump the day before he was appointed as special counsel as a job interview for the open FBI spot . `` Not as a candidate , '' for the job , Mueller said .
So someone is lying here . Worth noting : Mueller 's testimony was under oath . Trump 's tweet was , uh , not .
When Democrats asked questions of Mueller , they mostly followed this blueprint : a ) praise Mueller for his service b ) ask Mueller to draw conclusions from his report c ) when Mueller declines to do so , read a portion of the report d ) say that Trump clearly obstructed the investigation and e ) thank Mueller for his service .
When Republicans asked question of Mueller , they mostly followed this blueprint : a ) yell at Mueller b ) ask him questions about Christopher Steele that -- per point No . 2 above -- he has already said he will not go into and c ) conclude that Mueller unfairly persecuted Trump and his inner circle .
The whiplash was stark . And meant -- stop me if you 've heard this before -- that people will likely hear what they want to hear coming out of this hearing .
7 . Mueller said that he did n't consider indicting Trump on obstruction because of Justice guidelines . Except ...
In an exchange with Democratic California Rep. Ted Lieu , Mueller said , unequivocally , that the reason that he did not even consider indicting the President on obstruction charges was because of guidance from the Office of Legal Counsel ( within the Justice Department ) that a sitting President can not be indicted .
That contradicts repeated assertions by Barr that the OLC ruling was not the only reason that Mueller did n't indict Trump . It also seemingly contradicts a May joint statement from spokespeople for the special counsel 's office and the Department of Justice that said this : `` The Attorney General has previously stated that the Special Counsel repeatedly affirmed that he was not saying that , but for the [ Office of Legal Counsel ] opinion , he would have found the President obstructed justice . The Special Counsel 's report and his statement today made clear that the office concluded it would not reach a determination -- one way or the other -- about whether the President committed a crime . There is no conflict between these statements . ''
When questioned about this seeming contradiction by Republican Arizona Rep. Debbie Lesko , Mueller said only that he `` would have to look at it closer . '' Uh , yeah .
Mueller later clarified -- during his appearance before the House Intelligence Committee -- that he had misspoken to Lieu when asked about the role the OLC opinion played in his decision not to consider charging Trump . `` We did not reach a determination as to whether the President committed a crime , '' Mueller said .
8 . Mueller came to life when his underlings were attacked
In a rare break from a low-key performance in front of the Judiciary Committee , Mueller pushed back hard against Florida Republican Rep. Greg Steube 's attacks on the political affiliations ( and donations ) of the lawyers who worked for him in the special counsel 's office .
Mueller said that at no time in his 25 years of doing just this sort of thing had he `` had occasion once to ask somebody about their political affiliation . It is not done . '' That is a clapback at not just Steube but also Trump , who has been fixated for much of the last two years , on donations made to Hillary Clinton by some members of the special counsel 's office .
Donald Trump was clearly thrilled with the way the morning hearing went . `` I would like to thank the Democrats for holding this morning 's hearing , '' he tweeted just after 1 p.m . ET . `` Now , after 3 hours , Robert Mueller has to subject himself to # ShiftySchiff - an Embarrassment to our Country ! '' And while it 's clear that Democrats did not reap the huge wins some of them expected they might , it 's also true that Mueller confirmed , verbally that is , lots of facts that the President of the United States seems reluctant to admit . Among them : a ) Russia interfered in the election to help Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton b ) the Trump campaign was thrilled about that effort and c ) Trump was involved in business dealing in Russia ( the discussions of the construction of Trump Tower Moscow ) . None of that is good news -- at all -- for the President and his many past denials on these issues .
Democratic Illinois Rep. Mike Quigley read a series of tweets and quotes from Trump during the final months of the 2016 election in which he touted WikiLeaks , which was releasing emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta . Quigley asked Mueller what he thought of Trump 's actions . Mueller responded : `` Problematic is an understatement , in terms of what it displays , in terms of giving some hope or some boost to what is and should be illegal activity . ''
In terms of Mueller 's willingness to scold or smack down Trump , this was about as far as he was willing to go .","(CNN) The big day is over. After months of legal wrangling -- and more than 100 days after the release of his report detailing Russia's attempts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election -- former special counsel Robert Mueller took questions from Capitol Hill lawmakers for hours on Wednesday.

I watched all of it and collected my key takeaways in real time. They're below.

1. Trump's tweets showed how anxious he actually was

President Donald Trump and his aides have gone out of their way to paint the President as annoyed but unconcerned about Mueller's testimony . ""No, I'm not going to be watching, probably, maybe I'll see a little bit of it,"" Trump told reporters on Monday in the Oval Office. ""I'm not going to be watching Mueller because you can't take all those bites out of the apple. We had no collusion, no obstruction.""

Is that the tweet of a man who is entirely unworried about what the former special counsel would say -- and what it might mean for his political future? Yeah, I don't think so either.

2. Mueller disappointed Republicans

In his opening statement, Mueller made clear that he would be unable to address anything related to the origins of the counterintelligence investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election or the so-called "" Steele dossier ,"" an opposition research document put together by former British spy Christopher Steele.

President Trump has long insisted that the entire investigation -- the initial probe which led to the appointment of the special counsel and all that followed from it -- was illegal because it was based on the Steele document, which contained research that was partially funded by Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee.

Mueller's affirmation that he would not answer any questions about the genesis of the probe and/or the Steele dossier took a major line of questioning off the table for Republicans.

3. ... and Democrats

In that same opening statement, Mueller said he would not address any questions involving Attorney General William Barr or the actions of Congress. That's a big blow for Democrats , who very much wanted to explore differences in public statements about the special counsel investigation between Mueller and Barr, particularly as it related to how Barr characterized the findings of the report on obstruction.

4. Mueller was shaky -- especially at the start

If Democrats hoped that Mueller would easily bat away Republican attacks -- on him and on his report -- they were sorely disappointed in the opening moments of his testimony. Mueller seemingly contradicted himself (and the report) when he told Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, the ranking Republican member on the committee, that collusion and conspiracy were not the same thing.

Mueller also seemed to struggle to hear and/or understand questions from member of both sides as well as to find various references members were making to the Mueller report, asking for questions to be repeated. Democrats viewed the hearing as a chance for the public to hear what the President did (and didn't do) from a straight-out-of-central-casting prosecutor. Mueller didn't come across like that.

5. Mueller directly contradicted Trump on FBI job

On Wednesday morning, Trump tweeted this: ""It has been reported that Robert Mueller is saying that he did not apply and interview for the job of FBI Director (and get turned down) the day before he was wrongfully appointed Special Counsel. Hope he doesn't say that under oath in that we have numerous witnesses to the interview, including the Vice President of the United States!""

Except ... under questioning from Republican Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert, Mueller directly contradicted Trump's version of events. As Gohmert was attacking Mueller's alleged conflicts of interest, he cited Mueller meeting with Trump the day before he was appointed as special counsel as a job interview for the open FBI spot. ""Not as a candidate,"" for the job, Mueller said.

So someone is lying here. Worth noting: Mueller's testimony was under oath. Trump's tweet was, uh, not.

6. There were actually two different hearings

When Democrats asked questions of Mueller, they mostly followed this blueprint: a) praise Mueller for his service b) ask Mueller to draw conclusions from his report c) when Mueller declines to do so, read a portion of the report d) say that Trump clearly obstructed the investigation and e) thank Mueller for his service.

When Republicans asked question of Mueller, they mostly followed this blueprint: a) yell at Mueller b) ask him questions about Christopher Steele that -- per point No. 2 above -- he has already said he will not go into and c) conclude that Mueller unfairly persecuted Trump and his inner circle.

The whiplash was stark. And meant -- stop me if you've heard this before -- that people will likely hear what they want to hear coming out of this hearing.

7. Mueller said that he didn't consider indicting Trump on obstruction because of Justice guidelines. Except...

In an exchange with Democratic California Rep. Ted Lieu, Mueller said, unequivocally, that the reason that he did not even consider indicting the President on obstruction charges was because of guidance from the Office of Legal Counsel (within the Justice Department) that a sitting President cannot be indicted.

That is a clapback at not just Steube but also Trump, who has been fixated for much of the last two years, on donations made to Hillary Clinton by some members of the special counsel's office.

9. Mueller (re)confirmed lots of details Trump doesn't acknowledge

Donald Trump was clearly thrilled with the way the morning hearing went. ""I would like to thank the Democrats for holding this morning's hearing,"" he tweeted just after 1 p.m. ET. ""Now, after 3 hours, Robert Mueller has to subject himself to #ShiftySchiff - an Embarrassment to our Country!"" And while it's clear that Democrats did not reap the huge wins some of them expected they might, it's also true that Mueller confirmed, verbally that is, lots of facts that the President of the United States seems reluctant to admit.

None of that is good news -- at all -- for the President and his many past denials on these issues.

10. Mueller said Trump's WikiLeaks comments were ""problematic""

Democratic Illinois Rep. Mike Quigley read a series of tweets and quotes from Trump during the final months of the 2016 election in which he touted WikiLeaks, which was releasing emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. Quigley asked Mueller what he thought of Trump's actions. Mueller responded : ""Problematic is an understatement, in terms of what it displays, in terms of giving some hope or some boost to what is and should be illegal activity.""

us_congress,Politico,0,http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/republicans-working-together-finally-215998,Ryan and McConnell confront their first big test,2015-11-17,"Jake Sherman, Lauren French, Bryan Bender","It ’ s been years since any legislating on Capitol Hill could be described as efficient .
But as Republicans watched the crisis in Paris unfold , coupled with President Barack Obama ’ s plan to allow thousands of Syrian refugees into the U.S. , GOP leaders produced a coordinated response — at least for now . In doing so , Speaker Paul Ryan , House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have so far sidestepped the messy , charged fights that have come to split the Republican Party and typify the modern-day Congress .
On Thursday , the House will vote on a bill that is aimed at stepping up background checks before Syrian and Iraqi refugees are let into America — an idea first envisioned by Rep. Richard Hudson ( R-N.C. ) . It ’ s almost certain to pass the House with some level of Democratic support . And the tactics GOP leaders used to quickly unify their party behind a single idea — described by multiple lawmakers and aides involved in the discussions — could be instructive when envisioning how the next two years might work on Capitol Hill .
McCarthy was home in Bakersfield , California , when attackers opened fire in Paris Friday night , killing at least 129 people and terrorizing the French capital .
The No . 2 House Republican knew Congress would have to respond . So , beginning Friday night and stretching into Saturday morning , McCarthy convened a series of calls with committee chairmen like Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mike McCaul of Texas and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce of California . Hudson spoke to McCarthy about his bill , which McCarthy thought was a good start and deserved consideration . On Saturday , McCarthy called the new speaker and described what he was up to .
And on Saturday night , McCarthy held another conference call to discuss the attack and Paris , and what U.S. policy should be going forward .
When the House got into session Monday evening , McCarthy and his aides chatted with House Democratic leadership . Hudson and McCaul began talking to ranking members like Homeland Security ’ s top Democrat , Bennie Thompson of Mississippi . Ryan , meanwhile , had a previously scheduled meeting with McConnell ( R-Ky. ) , where the two discussed the strategy . The next day , McConnell sounded the same message as Ryan : Put the refugee resettlement program for Syrians on hold , for now .
`` The ability to vet people coming from that part of the world is really quite limited . And so that ’ s why I for one don ’ t feel particularly comforted by the assertion that our government can vet these refugees , '' McConnell said on Tuesday . “ At the very least , it strikes me that we need a pause or a moratorium because the American people are quite concerned and upset about the possibility of terrorists coming into our country through some kind of refugee program . ''
The unfolding crisis following the Paris terror attacks amounts to the first major test of the new relationship between Ryan and McConnell , who are carefully navigating public trepidation about whether the government ’ s resettlement program poses a safety threat .
McConnell added that he and Ryan were talking to the White House about any legislation Obama may be open to -- adding to the layers of coordination .
Of course , this could all blow up . The migrant problem could get worse . Obama and congressional Democrats might still reject the GOP ’ s plan , sidelining it for the time being . Or hard-line Republicans might demand its consideration as part of the government funding bill — which could threaten a shutdown .
Without a clear answer on how to more aggressively counter ISIL , much of the fallout from the Paris attacks has been focused on the Syrian refugees after news reports revealed that at least one of the terrorists may have arrived with migrants through Greece . More than two dozen governors have said their states are effectively closed to refugees because they pose an unacceptable security risk .
GOP presidential candidates have taken a sharp turn to the right in their rhetoric , after many of them just weeks ago expressed sympathy for the plight of the displaced Syrians . The Obama administration , watching the growing fear about the refugees , sought on Tuesday to cool the rhetoric , holding a call in which senior officials said such men and women are the most heavily scrutinized group of people allowed to enter the United States .
But GOP leaders in both chambers are under pressure from their rank and file to act on the refugee situation , and that pressure will likely not let up -- especially as Congress inches closer to a Dec. 11 deadline to pass a spending bill that 's already been a ripe target for policy riders .
“ There ’ s a lot of interest in it , '' said South Dakota Sen. John Thune , the third-ranking Senate Republican . `` A lot of our members want to see it addressed . ''
GOP leaders have left open a must-pass spending bill as an option to attach policy changes that would enact tougher oversight of the resettlement program . A growing number of GOP lawmakers are pushing leadership to be more aggressive ; 55 House Republicans have signed a letter led by Rep. Brian Babin of Texas demanding a rider in the Dec. 11 spending bill that would strip funding for the Obama administration ’ s plans to accept 10,000 more refugees from Syria .
House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers ( R-Ky. ) said he does not `` have a real preference '' as to whether the language is inserted into the omnibus .

But as Republicans watched the crisis in Paris unfold, coupled with President Barack Obama’s plan to allow thousands of Syrian refugees into the U.S., GOP leaders produced a coordinated response — at least for now. In doing so, Speaker Paul Ryan, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have so far sidestepped the messy, charged fights that have come to split the Republican Party and typify the modern-day Congress.



On Thursday, the House will vote on a bill that is aimed at stepping up background checks before Syrian and Iraqi refugees are let into America — an idea first envisioned by Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.). It’s almost certain to pass the House with some level of Democratic support. And the tactics GOP leaders used to quickly unify their party behind a single idea — described by multiple lawmakers and aides involved in the discussions — could be instructive when envisioning how the next two years might work on Capitol Hill.

Story Continued Below

McCarthy was home in Bakersfield, California, when attackers opened fire in Paris Friday night, killing at least 129 people and terrorizing the French capital.

The No. 2 House Republican knew Congress would have to respond. So, beginning Friday night and stretching into Saturday morning, McCarthy convened a series of calls with committee chairmen like Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mike McCaul of Texas and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce of California. Hudson spoke to McCarthy about his bill, which McCarthy thought was a good start and deserved consideration. On Saturday, McCarthy called the new speaker and described what he was up to.

And on Saturday night, McCarthy held another conference call to discuss the attack and Paris, and what U.S. policy should be going forward.

When the House got into session Monday evening, McCarthy and his aides chatted with House Democratic leadership. Hudson and McCaul began talking to ranking members like Homeland Security’s top Democrat, Bennie Thompson of Mississippi. Ryan, meanwhile, had a previously scheduled meeting with McConnell (R-Ky.), where the two discussed the strategy. The next day, McConnell sounded the same message as Ryan: Put the refugee resettlement program for Syrians on hold, for now.

""The ability to vet people coming from that part of the world is really quite limited. And so that’s why I for one don’t feel particularly comforted by the assertion that our government can vet these refugees,"" McConnell said on Tuesday. “At the very least, it strikes me that we need a pause or a moratorium because the American people are quite concerned and upset about the possibility of terrorists coming into our country through some kind of refugee program.""

The unfolding crisis following the Paris terror attacks amounts to the first major test of the new relationship between Ryan and McConnell, who are carefully navigating public trepidation about whether the government’s resettlement program poses a safety threat.

McConnell added that he and Ryan were talking to the White House about any legislation Obama may be open to -- adding to the layers of coordination.



Of course, this could all blow up. The migrant problem could get worse. Obama and congressional Democrats might still reject the GOP’s plan, sidelining it for the time being. Or hard-line Republicans might demand its consideration as part of the government funding bill — which could threaten a shutdown.

Without a clear answer on how to more aggressively counter ISIL, much of the fallout from the Paris attacks has been focused on the Syrian refugees after news reports revealed that at least one of the terrorists may have arrived with migrants through Greece. More than two dozen governors have said their states are effectively closed to refugees because they pose an unacceptable security risk.

GOP presidential candidates have taken a sharp turn to the right in their rhetoric, after many of them just weeks ago expressed sympathy for the plight of the displaced Syrians. The Obama administration, watching the growing fear about the refugees, sought on Tuesday to cool the rhetoric, holding a call in which senior officials said such men and women are the most heavily scrutinized group of people allowed to enter the United States.

But GOP leaders in both chambers are under pressure from their rank and file to act on the refugee situation, and that pressure will likely not let up -- especially as Congress inches closer to a Dec. 11 deadline to pass a spending bill that's already been a ripe target for policy riders.

“There’s a lot of interest in it,"" said South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the third-ranking Senate Republican. ""A lot of our members want to see it addressed.""

GOP leaders have left open a must-pass spending bill as an option to attach policy changes that would enact tougher oversight of the resettlement program. A growing number of GOP lawmakers are pushing leadership to be more aggressive; 55 House Republicans have signed a letter led by Rep. Brian Babin of Texas demanding a rider in the Dec. 11 spending bill that would strip funding for the Obama administration’s plans to accept 10,000 more refugees from Syria.

House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers (R-Ky.) said he does not ""have a real preference"" as to whether the language is inserted into the omnibus.

But House GOP leaders maneuvered as if they prefer to act before the government funding fight gets into full swing.

McCarthy also convened a meeting with top committee chairmen on Tuesday. There, the senior House Republicans discussed allowing Iraqi and Syrian refugees only if the Department of Homeland Security certifies that the person is not a threat; the FBI conducts background checks into the migrant and certifies he is not a danger to the U.S.; and the Homeland Security inspector general conducts a ""risk-based review of all certifications and provide an annual report detailing its findings to the appropriate committees,"" according to a source involved.

Senators, meanwhile, are seeking more information.

All senators will be briefed on the Paris attacks on Wednesday by top Obama administration officials, including DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson; FBI Director James Comey; Nick Rasmussen, director of the National Counterterrorism Center; and other senior officials from the Pentagon and the State Department. House lawmakers held a similar briefing Tuesday.

Senate Democrats were largely waiting for the briefing before weighing in with any policy changes they would support in response to the refugee resettlement program. The top Senate Democrat, Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, stressed to reporters that the vetting process for refugees already takes 18 to 24 months and that only roughly 2,000 refugees from Syria had been admitted to the United States in the past four years.

“I don’t think at this stage, we should be pausing until we get the facts,” Reid told reporters.

Still, other senior Senate Democrats left the option on the table.

“We’re waiting for the briefing [on Wednesday]; a pause may be necessary,” said New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, the third-ranking Senate Democrat. “We’re going to look at it.”

“ The remains of human beings should be treated better than medical waste , ” continued Shaheen . “ Rep . Frank Ryan ’ s bill is a compassionate effort to help offer some closure to many mothers and families in Pennsylvania . ”

Congress is working to try to enact the most sweeping overhaul of the tax code since the 1980s that would lower taxes for millions of individual tax payers and slash the rate paid by corporations .

However factors like the 2016 elections may give Democrats incentive to block GOP efforts
One question will be how the GOP decides to address Obama 's health care law
Another issue is immigration though chances look slim for sweeping legislation
Voters who are fed up with endless gridlock might be disappointed if they expect a Senate now controlled by Republicans to change things .
One congressional expert put it bluntly : `` The basic factors causing [ gridlock ] are not gone , '' said James Thurberfrom , a professor at American University . `` So it is likely that we will have a lot of delay and stalemate in the Senate . ''
The stark reality is Republicans do n't have the 60 votes they need to overcome Democratic filibusters , making it hard to pass many of their priorities .
But perhaps the biggest obstacle for Republicans -- the next election .

Senate aides from both parties and outside congressional observers agree that political positioning for the upcoming 2016 presidential and congressional elections will likely dominate the day-to-day workings of the Senate ,
While Republican leaders believe it is important they show the country they can pass legislation and govern effectively , Democrats will likely do everything they can to block GOP achievements because they think they have a good chance of winning back the chamber in 2016 .
In that cycle , Republicans need to defend 24 seats -- many from politically divided states -- while Democrats only have to defend 10 , most of which are from blue states .
`` Look , the Democrats see an opportunity to keep the White House in 2016 and pick up seats and get the majority back , '' said a GOP Senate aide predicting Democrats will refuse to work with them .
Complicating matters for Republicans is an expected tug of war within their party , with potential 2016 presidential contenders trying to assert their conservative credentials while other GOP Senators in competitive states try to appeal to moderate voters .
`` I think it 's going to be a little bit more chaotic and disorderly , '' said Ramesh Ponnuru , of the American Enterprise Institute , a conservative think tank .
In addition , it 's unclear how President Barack Obama will respond to a Congress fully in Republican control , and whetherl he will make a genuine effort to cut hard-to-reach compromises or be more aloof , choosing to shore up his legacy over the last two years of his term by issuing executive orders on immigration and other priorities .
Kentucky Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell , currently the Senate minority leader , is set to take over the powerful top job in the Senate when the new Congress convenes in January .
After complaining for years that the Democrats put politics ahead of a well-functioning Senate , McConnell has vowed to return to `` regular order '' so that budgets , spending bills , and other items are approved months before the threat of a government shutdown or fiscal cliff looms .
But his longtime sparring partner , Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada , is sure to challenge him on anything Democrats oppose .
`` I think there will continue to be a battle between Reid and McConnell . They do n't like each other , '' Thurber said . `` Reid will use delaying tactics as a minority leader , threatening filibusters . I do n't think Republicans will have 60 votes so they ca n't overcome that . ''
The particular dynamics of the Republican conference make it even more difficult for McConnell to manage the Senate . On one side of his conference he has three tea party senators -- Rand Paul of Kentucky , Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas -- who may seek the GOP nomination for president and who will be reluctant to cut deals with Democrats as they work to attract conservative primary voters .
On the other side are a dozen or more senators who will be up for re-election in purple and blue states -- such as Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mark Kirk of Illinois -- who may want work across the aisle to show the broad base of voters in their states that they helped cut through the DC gridlock .
`` I think he will be constantly maneuvering and using duct tape and glue to keep his conference together , '' Ponnuru said of McConnell .
In fact , Cruz has already proposed a ten-step plan he 'd like Republicans to follow next year . He argued , in a recent USA Today column , his plan would prove to voters Republican senators take seriously their desire to change Washington . His ideas include implementing tax reform , passing a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution , reforming federal education policies , auditing the Federal Reserve , and repealing or reforming Obamacare .
One of Republicans ' top priorities will be to rework parts of Obamacare , with the recognition they wo n't be able to repeal the law in its entirety because of President Obama 's veto authority . But they at least want to make changes to the individual and employer mandates , get rid of the medical device tax , and pass other reforms .

`` I think it 's more likely we 'll have a step-by-step approach to dismantling it and replacing it with consumer oriented , more cost-effective health care that wo n't interfere with the doctor/patient relationship , '' said Sen. John Cornyn of Texas , the second-ranking Republican senator . `` That 's what the American people want and that 's what our goal is to provide . ''
Another major concern among Republicans is Obama 's plan to use his executive authority to change immigration laws , something he may announce shortly after the election .
Republicans hope to be in a stronger position to push back on those changes now that they will control both the House and Senate .
Republicans also want to pass several energy bills , including approval of the Keystone XL pipeline . And they and want to push through a variety of job creation bills that passed in the GOP-controlled House last Congress but that were never taken up by Senate Democrats .
Bipartisan support is possible on pending trade bills supported by the White House .
One of the biggest changes to Capitol life that McConnell says he will institute is to have the Senate work an actual five day work week .

However factors like the 2016 elections may give Democrats incentive to block GOP efforts

One question will be how the GOP decides to address Obama's health care law

Another issue is immigration though chances look slim for sweeping legislation

Voters who are fed up with endless gridlock might be disappointed if they expect a Senate now controlled by Republicans to change things.

One congressional expert put it bluntly: ""The basic factors causing [gridlock] are not gone,"" said James Thurberfrom, a professor at American University. ""So it is likely that we will have a lot of delay and stalemate in the Senate.""

The stark reality is Republicans don't have the 60 votes they need to overcome Democratic filibusters, making it hard to pass many of their priorities.

But perhaps the biggest obstacle for Republicans -- the next election.

Senate aides from both parties and outside congressional observers agree that political positioning for the upcoming 2016 presidential and congressional elections will likely dominate the day-to-day workings of the Senate,

While Republican leaders believe it is important they show the country they can pass legislation and govern effectively, Democrats will likely do everything they can to block GOP achievements because they think they have a good chance of winning back the chamber in 2016.

In that cycle, Republicans need to defend 24 seats -- many from politically divided states -- while Democrats only have to defend 10, most of which are from blue states.

""Look, the Democrats see an opportunity to keep the White House in 2016 and pick up seats and get the majority back,"" said a GOP Senate aide predicting Democrats will refuse to work with them.

Complicating matters for Republicans is an expected tug of war within their party, with potential 2016 presidential contenders trying to assert their conservative credentials while other GOP Senators in competitive states try to appeal to moderate voters.

""I think it's going to be a little bit more chaotic and disorderly,"" said Ramesh Ponnuru, of the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.

In addition, it's unclear how President Barack Obama will respond to a Congress fully in Republican control, and whetherl he will make a genuine effort to cut hard-to-reach compromises or be more aloof, choosing to shore up his legacy over the last two years of his term by issuing executive orders on immigration and other priorities.

Kentucky Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, currently the Senate minority leader, is set to take over the powerful top job in the Senate when the new Congress convenes in January.

After complaining for years that the Democrats put politics ahead of a well-functioning Senate, McConnell has vowed to return to ""regular order"" so that budgets, spending bills, and other items are approved months before the threat of a government shutdown or fiscal cliff looms.

But his longtime sparring partner, Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, is sure to challenge him on anything Democrats oppose.

""I think there will continue to be a battle between Reid and McConnell. They don't like each other,"" Thurber said. ""Reid will use delaying tactics as a minority leader, threatening filibusters. I don't think Republicans will have 60 votes so they can't overcome that.""

The particular dynamics of the Republican conference make it even more difficult for McConnell to manage the Senate. On one side of his conference he has three tea party senators -- Rand Paul of Kentucky, Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas -- who may seek the GOP nomination for president and who will be reluctant to cut deals with Democrats as they work to attract conservative primary voters.

On the other side are a dozen or more senators who will be up for re-election in purple and blue states -- such as Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mark Kirk of Illinois -- who may want work across the aisle to show the broad base of voters in their states that they helped cut through the DC gridlock.

""I think he will be constantly maneuvering and using duct tape and glue to keep his conference together,"" Ponnuru said of McConnell.

In fact, Cruz has already proposed a ten-step plan he'd like Republicans to follow next year. He argued, in a recent USA Today column, his plan would prove to voters Republican senators take seriously their desire to change Washington. His ideas include implementing tax reform, passing a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, reforming federal education policies, auditing the Federal Reserve, and repealing or reforming Obamacare.

One of Republicans' top priorities will be to rework parts of Obamacare, with the recognition they won't be able to repeal the law in its entirety because of President Obama's veto authority. But they at least want to make changes to the individual and employer mandates, get rid of the medical device tax, and pass other reforms.

""I think it's more likely we'll have a step-by-step approach to dismantling it and replacing it with consumer oriented, more cost-effective health care that won't interfere with the doctor/patient relationship,"" said Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the second-ranking Republican senator. ""That's what the American people want and that's what our goal is to provide.""

Another major concern among Republicans is Obama's plan to use his executive authority to change immigration laws, something he may announce shortly after the election.

Republicans hope to be in a stronger position to push back on those changes now that they will control both the House and Senate.

Republicans also want to pass several energy bills, including approval of the Keystone XL pipeline. And they and want to push through a variety of job creation bills that passed in the GOP-controlled House last Congress but that were never taken up by Senate Democrats.

Bipartisan support is possible on pending trade bills supported by the White House.

One of the biggest changes to Capitol life that McConnell says he will institute is to have the Senate work an actual five day work week. Under Reid, the Senate typically was in session only four days a week, with truncated schedules on Monday and Thursday. But doing so well test McConnell's ability as leader because members of both parties -- most of who travel back and forth to their states each weekend to be with their families and constituents -- have enjoyed the luxury of the shortened Senate week.",www.cnn.com,left,KLThcVfBPECZBpyz

December will be the lamest lame-duck session in a long time.

Senate Democrats and House Republicans are privately saying that the post-election work period will be completely uneventful, a marked shift from the past two lame-duck sessions, which resulted in a pair of major fiscal deals.

Aside from renewing government funding in the beginning of the month, Republican and Democratic sources privately say nothing else major — such as immigration, tax or entitlement reform — will happen. Both sides aren’t even pretending a big legislative push is in the offing.

The most recent attempt to ensure that the lame duck lives up to its name came Tuesday when House Republicans said they will extend the Export-Import Bank’s charter until 2015, avoiding a December fight over what many conservatives call corporate welfare.

“Rather than [have it] be until the CR expires in December, it will be June 30 for Ex-Im reauthorization,” Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers (R-Ky.) said Tuesday.

There’s sure to be hemming and hawing from commentators that Washington is, again, punting and missing a good opportunity to make progress on vital national issues. But there’s good news for lawmakers and their staff: It looks like D.C. will get its Christmas and New Year’s back after several lame-duck sessions that went until the last minute.

That Washington is expecting a near silent winter is a result of the uncertainty about the power structure in the next Congress. If Republicans take the Senate, they won’t likely want to cooperate in December. If Democrats maintain control of the chamber, the political gridlock will remain frozen. There is only one deadline — and it is in the beginning of the month. The incentives simply aren’t in place to make December big and bold.

Intricate political calculations are being made behind the scenes. For example, House Republicans are being careful not to place any legislative fights in the opening months of 2015 — they don’t want Republicans to have a rocky start if they snatch the Senate majority. There isn’t much talk about the post-election period in closed House Republican Conference strategy sessions.

In fact, House Republicans — who know they will remain in power come January — are so bullish on their party controlling the Senate, most of their internal planning is predicated on Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) becoming the majority leader in January. There have even been private conversations about a closed-door Senate-House policy retreat to develop an agenda if the party grabs control from Harry Reid (D-Nev.). They are privately fretting that Reid will push through a number of nominations if he loses the Senate.

The lame-duck plans — or lack thereof — were laid out by several top-level sources in both parties, and preview a December very different than in 2012 and 2010. In 2010, after Republicans pummeled Democrats to take control of the House, President Barack Obama and congressional leaders cut a deal to extend the Bush-era tax rates for all Americans. And in 2012, shortly after Mitt Romney and Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) lost the presidency, Congress narrowly averted the so-called fiscal cliff of steep tax increases and a government shutdown. Republicans agreed to raise taxes on wealthy Americans just before midnight on New Year’s Eve.

This year, there’s one main item to take care of in December: averting another government shutdown. The government-funding bill, which the House is likely to pass this week, will run until Dec. 11. Congress will return to D.C. at some point in late November — the House will hold its leadership elections then. Senior aides see two options to extend government funding: Rogers and Senate Appropriations Chairman Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.) want to begin crafting a long-term omnibus spending bill, but some in GOP leadership think it’s more likely Congress will pass another stop-gap spending measure.

House Republicans are eager to avoid another fiscal cliff scenario — piling a number of deadlines close to each other. The debt ceiling must be raised some time in March, April or May 2015, and the GOP wants to try to avoid placing the government-funding deadline in that range.

There are a few wild cards, however. A prolonged military conflict could force Congress to pass a supplemental spending bill. Several targeted tax provisions — known on Capitol Hill as “extenders” — need to be renewed. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act expires at year’s end — and Republicans want to squeeze that through. And there’s fear that if Obama takes any executive action on immigration, they will use the post-election period to try to cut off the White House’s authority.

The president has called for more funding for his troop surge but also has asked Congress to debate and authorize a new grant of power for him to pursue the war on terrorism.

House Republicans would like to pass a bill to grant tax incentives allowing the disabled to stow money tax-free.

The House and Senate also may confront the thorny issue of detainees at Guantanamo Bay when Congress tackles the annual defense policy bill, which is considered must-pass legislation.

us_congress,CNN (Web News),0,http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/16/politics/government-shutdown-questions/index.html,These 5 indisputable realities make a government shutdown a very real possibility,2018-01-16,"Analysis Chris Cillizza, Cnn Editor-At-Large","Most Americans have n't been paying much attention to that fact for a simple reason : These shutdown threats seem to arise almost monthly these days and Congress always seems to find a way to kick the can down the road and keep the lights on for another month or two .
After all , there 's only been one government shutdown in this century -- 2013 -- and , before that , the last shutdown was in 1995-1996 . These things just do n't really happen .
Except when they do . And there 's some reason to believe that this just might be one of those times -- given the number of moving parts , political calculations and policy differences at work .
Here are five realities about the current debate that are n't likely to change between today and Friday night .
1 . There is no DACA/border security deal in play right now
Lost amid all of the coverage of `` shithole '' coming out of last week 's meeting at the White House is the fact that when President Donald Trump scuttled the bipartisan deal built by the Gang of Six there was no plan waiting in the wings to replace it .
That was the deal . The idea that another immigration deal will suddenly emerge sometime over the next 72 hours misunderstands the policy and political complexities at work for both parties here . These deals take weeks and months to come together . And remember that Trump had pledged two days before the immigration meeting last Thursday that he would sign whatever Congress produced on immigration . So there was reason to believe that the deal was done .
The Donald Trump of last Tuesday -- all deal-maker and ca n't we all get along -- might have made lots of Democrats very nervous about letting the government shut down amid an immigration standoff . But Trump 's dismissal of immigrants coming from countries in Africa and central America -- and his preference for immigrants from countries like Norway -- has altered that dynamic .
Suddenly , the debate is n't about Democrats and their views on immigration at all -- it 's now centered on whether the President of the United States is a racist . It 's a much easier sell for Democrats to go to their constituents now and say , `` We tried to make a deal but Trump went off the rails . '' Much easier .
In the two most recent shutdown showdowns -- and , yes , I love that term -- there was split control in Washington . In both the 1995-1996 and 2013 shutdowns , Republicans held Congress while Democrats controlled the White House . That division made the debate over who would be blamed a toss-up in the days leading into the shutdowns . ( In both cases , it was Republicans in Congress who bore the brunt of it . )
That is not the scenario that faces us today . Republicans have the White House as well as majorities in the House and the Senate . The idea -- that Trump is pushing via his Twitter feed -- that Democrats will somehow be blamed for a shutdown does n't seem to be based in any sort of known reality .
`` Make no mistake about it , when a party holds the White House and majorities in both the House and Senate , they 'own ' any government shutdown , '' tweeted non-partisan political handicapper Charlie Cook on Tuesday morning . `` Things the President has said and done over the last week have only increased the price the GOP has to pay for that ownership . ''
Polling , too , bears out Cook 's point . In a December Quinnipiac University poll , 41 % said they would primarily blame Republicans in Congress while 31 % said the blame should mainly go to Democrats . Another 16 % said they would mostly blame Trump . Add it all up and you find that almost six in 10 people would blame either Republicans or Trump if the government shut down .
4 . The Democratic caucus is split between 2018 concerns and 2020 positioning
While Trump 's actions over the past week have made the politics of this shutdown showdown ( I did warn you I really like that term ) simpler for Democrats , the debate over how to proceed on immigration -- and the broader strategic question over how much or little Democrats should cooperate with Trump and Republicans -- is much more complicated for them .
The split within the party largely breaks down along political lines .
The 10 Democrats up for re-election in 2018 in states Trump won in 2016 -- including five in states Trump won by double digits -- are wary of appearing to be reflexively anti-Trump given that many of the voters they will face in November still view the President positively .
On the other side of that divide are the Democrats eyeing the 2020 presidential race -- Elizabeth Warren , Bernie Sanders , Kamala Harris , Kirsten Gillibrand and others -- who know that it 's impossible to be too anti-Trump in the eyes of the party 's liberal activist and donor base . The view among that group of politicians goes like this : Why should we do any sort of deal on immigration with Trump ? If the government shuts down , voters will blame Trump and Republicans . Why capitulate to him in any way , shape or form ?
5 . It 's not clear Republicans have the votes on anything
In the House , at least , Democrats seem very likely to withhold their votes on a clean budget bill that would prevent the government shutdown . If that happens , it 's not clear that Speaker Paul Ryan has the votes -- or can get them -- among the GOP conference for a ( nother ) short-term budget plan .
The House Freedom Caucus -- the most conservative element within the House GOP -- is making rumblings that they may not be willing to provide any ( or very few ) votes for another kick-the-can move . If the Freedom Caucus comes out against another effort to fund the government in the near term , then Ryan will have to either a ) prepare for the shutdown or b ) find Democratic votes somehow .
In short : Do n't assume Republicans can simply fund the government at the last-minute on Friday night . They may not be able to .","Most Americans haven't been paying much attention to that fact for a simple reason: These shutdown threats seem to arise almost monthly these days and Congress always seems to find a way to kick the can down the road and keep the lights on for another month or two.

1. There is no DACA/border security deal in play right now

Lost amid all of the coverage of ""shithole"" coming out of last week's meeting at the White House is the fact that when President Donald Trump scuttled the bipartisan deal built by the Gang of Six there was no plan waiting in the wings to replace it.

That was the deal. The idea that another immigration deal will suddenly emerge sometime over the next 72 hours misunderstands the policy and political complexities at work for both parties here.

2. Trump's ""shithole"" controversy gives Democrats political cover

The Donald Trump of last Tuesday -- all deal-maker and can't we all get along -- might have made lots of Democrats very nervous about letting the government shut down amid an immigration standoff. But Trump's dismissal of immigrants coming from countries in Africa and central America -- and his preference for immigrants from countries like Norway -- has altered that dynamic.

It's a much easier sell for Democrats to go to their constituents now and say, ""We tried to make a deal but Trump went off the rails."" Much easier.

3. Republicans control all levers of power in Washington

In the two most recent shutdown showdowns -- and, yes, I love that term -- there was split control in Washington. In both the 1995-1996 and 2013 shutdowns, Republicans held Congress while Democrats controlled the White House. That division made the debate over who would be blamed a toss-up in the days leading into the shutdowns. (In both cases, it was Republicans in Congress who bore the brunt of it.)

That is not the scenario that faces us today. Republicans have the White House as well as majorities in the House and the Senate. The idea -- that Trump is pushing via his Twitter feed -- that Democrats will somehow be blamed for a shutdown doesn't seem to be based in any sort of known reality.

The measure passed the Democrat-controlled Senate on Friday by a 62-32 vote , after Republicans failed to pass amendments that would have cut the package to $ 24 billion .
The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that only about $ 9 billion of the $ 60.4 billion would be spent over the next nine months .

Rep. Paul Ryan , the party ’ s 2012 vice presidential nominee and a leading House fiscal conservative , has criticized the Democratic bill as `` packed with funding for unrelated items ” such as commercial fisheries in American Samoa and roof repair of museums in Washington .
Senate Republicans tried to strip commercial fisheries and other non-immediate funding from their chamber ’ s bill .
Sen. Tom Coburn , R-Okla. , also targeted the fisheries disaster funding , unsuccessfully proposing an amendment to cut $ 150 million that could go to Alaska , the Gulf Coast and New England states .
Sen. Charles Schumer , D-N.Y. , urged House leaders to quickly bring the Senate bill to the chamber floor to allow a vote .
He also the Senate bill provides `` very good groundwork '' for seeking Sandy aid next year , should the House vote against the legislation .
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi also urged House leaders to allow a vote .
`` Our fellow Americans are waiting for relief to rebuild their homes , businesses , communities and lives , ” the California Democrat said . “ Now that the Senate has acted … the House must do the same immediately . ”
The measure includes $ 11.5 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency 's chief disaster relief fund and $ 17 billion for community development block grants , much of which would help homeowners repair or replace their homes . Another $ 11.7 billion would help repair New York City 's subways and other mass transit damage and protect them from future storms . Some $ 9.7 billion would go toward the government 's flood insurance program . The Army Corps of Engineers would receive $ 5.3 billion to mitigate flood future risks and rebuild damaged projects .
To court votes , Democrats last week broadened some of their bill 's provisions to cover damage from Hurricane Isaac , which struck the Gulf Coast earlier this year . A provision was added to the $ 2.9 billion allotted to Army Corps of Engineers projects to reduce future flooding risks ; the coverage area for that program will now include areas hit by Isaac in addition to Sandy . Democrats also shifted $ 400 million into a community development program for regions suffering disasters , beyond areas struck by Sandy .
A Coburn amendment to reduce the federal share of costs for the Army Corps of Engineer projects to reduce future flooding risks also failed .
Most of the money in the $ 60.4 billion bill -- $ 47.4 billion -- is for immediate help for victims and other recovery and rebuilding efforts . The aid is intended to help states rebuild public infrastructure like roads and tunnels , and help thousands of people displaced from their homes .
Coburn and Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona , frequent critics of government spending , targeted what they called `` questionable '' spending in the Democratic bill , including $ 2 million for roof repairs at Smithsonian Institution museums and $ 58 million in subsidies for tree planting on private properties .
Republicans also criticized $ 13 billion in the Democratic bill for projects to protect against future storms , including fortifying mass transit systems in the Northeast . Republicans said however worthy such projects may be , they are not urgently needed and should be considered by Congress in the usual appropriations process next year .
The Democratic bill included many large infrastructure projects that often require years to complete , but Republicans said the CBO estimate of such drawn-out spending undercuts the urgency of the Democrats ' aid package .
More than $ 2 billion in federal funds has been spent so far on relief efforts for 11 states and the District of Columbia . FEMA 's disaster relief fund still has about $ 4.3 billion , and officials have said that is enough to pay for recovery efforts into early spring .
New York , New Jersey , Connecticut , District of Columbia , West Virginia , Virginia , Maryland , New Hampshire , Delaware , Rhode Island , Pennsylvania and Massachusetts are receiving federal aid .

""Our fellow Americans are waiting for relief to rebuild their homes, businesses, communities and lives,” the California Democrat said. “Now that the Senate has acted … the House must do the same immediately.”

The measure includes $11.5 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency's chief disaster relief fund and $17 billion for community development block grants, much of which would help homeowners repair or replace their homes. Another $11.7 billion would help repair New York City's subways and other mass transit damage and protect them from future storms. Some $9.7 billion would go toward the government's flood insurance program. The Army Corps of Engineers would receive $5.3 billion to mitigate flood future risks and rebuild damaged projects.

To court votes, Democrats last week broadened some of their bill's provisions to cover damage from Hurricane Isaac, which struck the Gulf Coast earlier this year. A provision was added to the $2.9 billion allotted to Army Corps of Engineers projects to reduce future flooding risks; the coverage area for that program will now include areas hit by Isaac in addition to Sandy. Democrats also shifted $400 million into a community development program for regions suffering disasters, beyond areas struck by Sandy.

A Coburn amendment to reduce the federal share of costs for the Army Corps of Engineer projects to reduce future flooding risks also failed.

Most of the money in the $60.4 billion bill -- $47.4 billion -- is for immediate help for victims and other recovery and rebuilding efforts. The aid is intended to help states rebuild public infrastructure like roads and tunnels, and help thousands of people displaced from their homes.

Coburn and Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, frequent critics of government spending, targeted what they called ""questionable"" spending in the Democratic bill, including $2 million for roof repairs at Smithsonian Institution museums and $58 million in subsidies for tree planting on private properties.

A McCain amendment to strip the tree subsidies failed.

Republicans also criticized $13 billion in the Democratic bill for projects to protect against future storms, including fortifying mass transit systems in the Northeast. Republicans said however worthy such projects may be, they are not urgently needed and should be considered by Congress in the usual appropriations process next year.

The Democratic bill included many large infrastructure projects that often require years to complete, but Republicans said the CBO estimate of such drawn-out spending undercuts the urgency of the Democrats' aid package.

More than $2 billion in federal funds has been spent so far on relief efforts for 11 states and the District of Columbia. FEMA's disaster relief fund still has about $4.3 billion, and officials have said that is enough to pay for recovery efforts into early spring.

New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, District of Columbia, West Virginia, Virginia, Maryland, New Hampshire, Delaware, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts are receiving federal aid.



Sandy damaged or destroyed more than 72,000 homes and businesses in New Jersey. In New York, 305,000 housing units were damaged or destroyed and more than 265,000 businesses were affected.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ( D-NY ) whined on Monday about the possibility that she may not get a $ 4,500 pay raise — which she downplayed as only being a cost of living adjustment — as she compared members of Congress to minimum wage workers .
Fox News ’ Gregg Re reported that there has not been a cost of living adjustment for members of Congress for the past nine years and that Democrats in vulnerable states are worried about how a $ 4,500 pay increase will look during the next election .
Fox News ’ Chad Pergram caught up with Ocasio-Cortez — who makes $ 174,000 per year —on Monday and asked her about the possibility that Congress would not get the pay raise .
Ocasio Cortez says efforts to hike Congressional pay “ may not be politically popular to say but honestly this is why there ’ s so much pressure to turn to lobbying firms and to cash in on member service after people leave because precisely of this issue. ” — Chad Pergram ( @ ChadPergram ) June 11 , 2019 Ocasio-Cortez says efforts to hike Congressional pay are “ superficial .

“ You know , it may not be politically popular to say , but honestly , this is why there ’ s so much pressure to turn to lobbying firms and to cash in on members service after people leave because , because precisely of this issue , ” Ocasio-Cortez said . “ So it may be politically convenient and it may make you look good in the short term for saying , ‘ oh , we ’ re not voting for pay increases , ’ but we should be fighting for pay increases for every American worker . We should be fighting for a $ 15 minimum wage pegged to inflation so that everybody in the United States with a salary , with a wage gets a cost of living increase . ”

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) whined on Monday about the possibility that she may not get a $4,500 pay raise — which she downplayed as only being a cost of living adjustment — as she compared members of Congress to minimum wage workers.

Fox News’ Gregg Re reported that there has not been a cost of living adjustment for members of Congress for the past nine years and that Democrats in vulnerable states are worried about how a $4,500 pay increase will look during the next election.

Fox News’ Chad Pergram caught up with Ocasio-Cortez — who makes $174,000 per year —on Monday and asked her about the possibility that Congress would not get the pay raise.

Ocasio Cortez says efforts to hike Congressional pay “may not be politically popular to say but honestly this is why there’s so much pressure to turn to lobbying firms and to cash in on member service after people leave because precisely of this issue.” — Chad Pergram (@ChadPergram) June 11, 2019 Ocasio-Cortez says efforts to hike Congressional pay are “superficial.

“You know, it may not be politically popular to say, but honestly, this is why there’s so much pressure to turn to lobbying firms and to cash in on members service after people leave because, because precisely of this issue,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “So it may be politically convenient and it may make you look good in the short term for saying, ‘oh, we’re not voting for pay increases,’ but we should be fighting for pay increases for every American worker. We should be fighting for a $15 minimum wage pegged to inflation so that everybody in the United States with a salary, with a wage gets a cost of living increase.”

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON — President Trump warned Wednesday that a government shutdown still ""could happen"" this week, and sought to put the blame on Democrats over their stance on immigration policy.

""The Democrats may ... want to shut down the country because they want people flowing into our country,"" Trump said during a Cabinet meeting in which he talked up his overall agenda.

Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the House's top Democrat, replied in a tweet that Trump is the only one talking about a shutdown.

""Democrats are hopeful the President will be open to an agreement to address the urgent needs of the American people and keep government open,"" she said.

Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer are scheduled to participate in a meeting with Trump at the White House on Thursday.

Current federal spending is set to run out this weekend, and lawmakers are discussing an extension that would keep government agencies open until at least Dec. 22. But there are still sticking points among Republicans in the House and Democrats in the Senate, and time is running short.

Democrats are seeking to re-instate an Obama-era immigration policy to block deportation of children of parents who came into the country illegally.

Trump said Democratic policies would make it easier for criminals and ""radical Islamic"" terrorists to enter the country, and wants tighter ""screening"" of people seeking to cross the border.

Congressional Republicans said they will negotiate with Democrats on the status of young migrants in the new year, but the issue should not get tied up with consideration of a new spending plan.

It does not help migrants ""to try to force this into a shut-down narrative and to jeopardize our national security and other governmental functions just in order to help these young adults,"" said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Tex.

Democrats have accused Trump of exaggerating the impact of immigration policy on crime and terrorism, and say the president is using the issue to try and keep Muslims out of the United States.

During his Cabinet meeting at the White House, Trump also:

• Predicted that a stronger tax bill would emerge from a House-Senate conference committee that he likened to a legislative ""mixer.""

""I think when it comes out, it's going to be a beautiful mix,"" Trump said.

• Claimed that tax cuts would propel overall economic growth by up to 6 percentage points of gross domestic product, saying that ""I think we're going to be going up a lot of points.""

• Congratulated Defense Secretary James Mattis for what he called a successful campaign against the Islamic State overseas, then took credit for it himself: ""He's knocked the hell out 'em ... Of course, I've made it possible with what I've let you do.""

Collins is co-chairman of the House Trump Caucus and was the first member of Congress to endorse him .
He was Trump ’ s first congressional advocate on television and spent many votes on the House floor explaining to colleagues why Trump could and would win the presidential election .
“ All the other members would come up and say , ‘ Are you crazy ?

Hunter is the other co-chairman of the Trump Caucus . He urged GOP colleagues earlier this year to “ toughen up ” when they were wringing their hands over Trump ’ s chances of beating Clinton in the fall .
Hunter , a member of the Armed Services Committee , was one of the few members of Congress to defend Trump after the release of the “ Access Hollywood ” video , calling characterizations of Trump as a sexual predator “ completely unfair . ”
When The Washington Post interviewed him in October as a lonely inhabitant “ on the shrinking island of Donald Trump political backers , ” Hunter insisted he was not wavering in his support .
“ We need to do what ’ s right for the nation . Period , ” he said .
Hunter ’ s name was floated last month as a potential candidate for a number of high-level national security positions .
Barletta was the fourth member of Congress to endorse Trump , and he and Marino were founding members of the Trump Caucus .
They played a prominent role in spearheading Trump ’ s campaign efforts in their blue-leaning home state of Pennsylvania , where Clinton was leading by about 2 percentage points in the polls before Election Day .
Barletta is a member of the Trump transition team ’ s executive committee and is gathering the resumes of aspirants hoping to serve in the new administration and making recommendations on appointments .
As a senior member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee , he expects to play a central role next year in convincing GOP colleagues to fully meet Trump ’ s big infrastructure plans .

Brady , the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee , has jurisdiction over three of Trump ’ s biggest policy priorities — tax reform , healthcare reform and trade deal renegotiation — and has demonstrated an early willingness to work closely with the incoming administration .
Brady is taking the lead in drafting tax reform and , like Trump , wants to shrink the number of tax brackets , lower rates and simplify the code .
He would keep popular deductions for home mortgages and charitable giving , ideas backed by Trump to a degree . While Trump wants to preserve these popular tax breaks , he also wants to cap the total amount that individuals and families may deduct at $ 100,000 and $ 200,000 , respectively .
On the trade front , Brady has promised to work with Trump to strengthen enforcement of trade deals to ensure foreign partners fulfill their obligations .
“ It 's just not enough to buy American . We have to sell American all throughout the world , '' Brady told Reuters last month . `` These trade agreements , done right , strictly enforced , level that playing field . ''

She defended him from charges of sexism by arguing that women voters were more concerned about jobs and national security , and more recently has touted his commitment to giving women senior posts in the administration .
As a member of two House Energy and Commerce subcommittees — the Health Subcommittee and the Commerce , Manufacturing and Trade Subcommittee — Blackburn will have a role in next year ’ s healthcare reform and trade debates .

He worked closely with Trump before he delivered his major energy address in May at the Williston Basin Petroleum Conference in Bismarck , N.D. , where the president-elect laid out his “ America First ” plan .
