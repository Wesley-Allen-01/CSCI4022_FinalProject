Anger spurred by the death of a black teenager at the hands of white police officer boiled over again early Saturday morning in Ferguson, Missouri, when protesters stormed into a convenience store — the same store that Michael Brown was accused of robbing.

Police and about 200 protesters began clashing late Friday after another tense day in the St. Louis suburb, a day that included authorities identifying the officer who fatally shot Brown on Aug. 9. At the same news conference in which officer Darren Wilson was named, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson released documents alleging that Brown stole a $48.99 box of cigars from the convenience store, then strong-armed a man on his way out.

Just before midnight, some in what had been a large and rowdy but mostly well-behaved crowd broke into that same small store and began looting it, said Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson.

Some in the crowd began throwing rocks and other objects at police, Johnson said. One officer was hurt but details on the injury were not immediately available.

Johnson said police backed off to try and ease the tension. He believes looting may have spread to a couple of nearby stores. No arrests were made.

""We had to evaluate the security of the officers there and also the rioters,"" Johnson said. ""We just felt it was better to move back.""

Meanwhile, peaceful protesters yelled at the aggressors to stop what they were doing. About a dozen people eventually blocked off the front of the convenience store to help protect it.

Gov. Jay Nixon on Thursday appointed Johnson to take over security after concerns were raised about how local police had used tear gas and rubber bullets on protesters earlier in the week. Johnson said one tear gas canister was deployed Friday night after the group of rioters became unruly.

The capture

The squad of 13 U.S. marshals -- armed like a military special operations squad -- found Frein at an abandoned airport near Tannersville, authorities said.

Frein hadn't been spotted. He was discovered as part of a ""routine sweep through the woods,"" State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens told reporters.

And he wasn't armed at the time of his capture, according to police, much to the relief of authorities who feared a violent showdown.

When marshals surprised him in a field near the airport, he obeyed their orders to get down on his hands and knees and told them who he was, Noonan said. There was no struggle, Pike County District Attorney Raymond Tonkin said.

Investigators searching the area did find a cache that included a sniper rifle, Noonan said. The rifle appears to be consistent with casings gathered during the investigation, he said.

""He's been stashing food, he's been staying out in the woods,"" Noonan said. ""He had a lot of locations he knew how to hide in.

Officials said they were unsure how long he had been hiding at the airport.

Court appearance

During his court appearance Friday Frein looked thin, with the cut on his nose and abrasions on his forehead. His left cheek was swollen.

His voice was strong as he answered, ""Yes I do,"" to a Pike County judge's question if he understood the charges against him, which include first-degree murder and criminal homicide of a law enforcement officer.

About 30 police were in the room for the 10-minute hearing.

Tonkin, the district attorney, said he plans to seek the death penalty.

Tonkin declined to say what, if anything, Frein has revealed about the attack that left Dickson dead and Douglass critically wounded.

Douglass has since been released and is continuing to recover, according to police.

During the search, some outdoor activities were curtailed and some schoolchildren didn't go out for recess.

""It's just exciting and we're happy. We didn't go out of school for weeks for recess,"" resident Shannon Juirad told WNEP.

And then there was the question of Halloween.

At least one community, Barrett Township, canceled trick-or-treating as the search dragged on, instead suggesting children show up at a school parking lot to collect candy under the supervision of local and state police.

But with Frein in custody, the trick-or-treating will go on as normal, said Barrett Township Board Chairman Ralph Megliola.

SEOUL , South Korea — A large Black Lives Matter banner has been removed from the U.S. Embassy building in South Korea ’ s capital three days after it was raised there in solidarity with protesters back home .
The banner was put up Saturday , with Ambassador Harry Harris tweeting that his embassy “ stands in solidarity with fellow Americans grieving and peacefully protesting to demand positive change. ” But the banner was removed Monday and another banner commemorating the Korean War was on display Tuesday .
The embassy said the banner ’ s removal was meant to avoid any misperception that it aimed to encourage donations for certain unspecified organizations .
Harris “ wanted to highlight the enduring American values of racial equality , freedom of speech , and the right to peacefully protest , ” the U.S. Embassy said in a statement . “ However , the Ambassador ’ s intent was not to support or encourage donations to any specific organization . To avoid the misperception that American taxpayer dollars were spent to benefit such organizations , he directed that the banner be removed . ”
SEATTLE — The Seattle City Council has voted unanimously to bar police from using tear gas , pepper spray and several other crowd control devices after officers repeatedly used them on mostly peaceful demonstrators protesting racism and police brutality .
The 9-0 vote Monday came amid frustration with the Seattle Police Department , which used tear gas to disperse protesters in the city ’ s densest neighborhood , Capitol Hill , just days after Mayor Jenny Durkan and Chief Carmen Best promised not to .
The council heard repeated complaints from residents forced out of their homes by the gas even though they weren ’ t protesting ; one resident said his wife doused their child ’ s eyes with breast milk .
A federal judge on Friday issued a temporary order banning Seattle police from using tear gas , pepper spray , foam-tipped projectiles or other force against protesters , finding that the department had used less-lethal weapons “ disproportionately and without provocation , ” chilling free speech in the process .
NEW YORK — New York City ’ s police department is disbanding the type of plainclothes anti-crime units that were involved in the 2014 death of Eric Garner and have long been criticized for aggressive tactics , Commissioner Dermot Shea said Monday .
The NYPD ’ s anti-crime units , which focused primarily on seizing illegal guns , were responsible for a disproportionate number of shootings and complaints , Shea told reporters after meeting with top deputies to discuss the move .
The change comes amid a nationwide reckoning over police brutality .
Garner died when an officer enforcing a ban on the sale of loose cigarettes used a chokehold to wrestle him to the ground .
About 600 officers working in the unit will be given new assignments .
WASHINGTON — A senior administration official says an executive order that President Donald Trump is expected to sign Tuesday would set up a database for tracking police officers who have complaints about excessive use of force in their records .
The official says the administration wants to keep officers with complaints in their record from moving from one police department to the next .
The president ’ s executive order comes as lawmakers work quickly in response to outrage over the death of George Floyd . Senate Republicans are also poised to unveil an extensive package of policing changes .
Administration officials say the executive order would also establish a national credentialing system that would give police departments a financial incentive to adopt best practices on such things as use of deadly force and prohibiting the use of chokeholds , except in situations when deadly force is allowed by law .
The official says that cities such as Minneapolis and Baltimore “ are not using the most modern standards ” when it comes to their training materials .
Two officials briefed reporters on the executive order on the condition that they not be identified . The officials said they expect the major law enforcement trade groups to back the effort .
PARIS — Under pressure from police , the French government has backed away from a ban on chokeholds during arrests .
France ’ s interior minister announced a week ago that the maneuver would be abandoned , in the face of growing French protests over police brutality and racial injustice unleashed by George Floyd ’ s death in the U.S .
But French police responded with five straight days of counterprotests , arguing that the ban deprived them of a key tool to subdue unruly suspects .
On Monday , the national police director sent a letter to police , obtained by The ███ , saying chokeholds will no longer be taught in police schools but can continue to be used “ with discernment ” until alternatives are found .
RICHMOND , Va. — Six property owners in Virginia ’ s capital city of Richmond have filed a lawsuit seeking to stop Gov . Ralph Northam ’ s administration from removing a towering statue there to Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee .
The lawsuit challenges Northam ’ s authority to order removal of the Lee statue from Monument Avenue in the ex-capital of the Confederacy .
Northam ’ s spokeswoman says the governor considers the statue a “ divisive symbol. ” The governor recently ordered its removal , citing the pain gripping the country over the death in police custody of George Floyd , a black man in Minneapolis .
Richmond ’ s Confederate monuments became rallying points for protesters in recent days .
Last week , demonstrators toppled a statue of Jefferson Davis , president of the Confederacy , that was part of a much larger monument .
LAS VEGAS — A former U.S. Marine has been charged with impersonating a federal officer after the man was armed and wearing tactical gear as he stood alongside police at a protest in Las Vegas last month .
A criminal complaint alleges Zachary Sanns was wearing plain clothes with a tactical vest , helmet and belt , a balaclava , a stun gun and two firearms as he appeared near the front line May 30 with police as they faced off with people protesting the death of George Floyd .
He is charged with one count of false impersonation of an officer or employee of the United States . Sanns ’ attorney declined to comment .
RICHMOND , Va. — Richmond police say one protester was arrested after an overnight demonstration outside police headquarters turned violent and three officers were injured .
The confrontation began Sunday night and extended into the early morning hours Monday as hundreds of protesters gathered outside police headquarters to protest an earlier incident in which a police car struck several protesters blocking its path .
In a statement released Monday afternoon , Chief William Smith said some demonstrators threw rocks and other objects at police officers .
Smith said several city vehicles were heavily damaged , several privately owned buildings in the area were vandalized and numerous dumpster fires were set .
Protests against police brutality have rocked the U.S. since the death of George Floyd on May 25 .
LITTLE ROCK , Ark . — Retail giant Walmart closed some of its locations in Arkansas after Black Lives Matter demonstrators gathered outside of stores in an effort to shutter them in wake of George Floyd ’ s killing in Minneapolis .
The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports that four Walmart stores and a Sam ’ s Club closed on Sunday in Little Rock . The international corporation is based in the state .
Activist Dawn Jeffrey tells protesters at a Walmart location while live streaming on Facebook that they were done with the “ wicked Waltons . ”
She notes how the founding family takes too much money from the community and invests in private prisons .
WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump says he wants the governor of Washington to call in the National Guard to deal with demonstrators in Seattle , saying “ the problem with what happened in Seattle is it spreads , and all of a sudden they ’ ll say ‘ let ’ s do some other city and lets do another one . ’ ”
Trump is also suggesting that he ’ s got several options for dealing with demonstrators who have staked out several blocks near downtown Seattle after officers withdrew from a police station following violent confrontations . They named it the “ Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone . ”
Speaking to reporters at the White House , Trump says “ the American public is very angered by that . ”
Trump also complained that media organizations are not dedicating adequate attention to what ’ s happened in Seattle .
He said that if “ the right ever took over a city , conservative Republicans took over a city , it would be the biggest story in history . ”
Trump also spent several minutes criticizing Gov . Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan , calling her “ scared stiff . ”
“ If they don ’ t do the job , I ’ ll do the job , ” Trump said , declining a request to provide specifics .
BOSTON — A long-running New England television show spotlighting local restaurants and food has been taken off air after its CEO mocked the nationwide protests against police brutality on social media .
Boston-based stations WBZ-TV and WSBK-TV said in a statement Sunday that Phantom Gourmet , which first aired in the early 1990s , has been placed “ on hiatus pending further review . ”
Dave Andelman , the show ’ s CEO and co-host , took jabs at participants of the Black Lives Matter movement in a number of recent posts on his personal Facebook account .
He mockingly called for defunding “ potatoes , not police ” and suggested Boston restaurants and retailers “ offer touchless , curbside looting , ” in reference to the violence and destruction that followed a recent downtown protest .
DULUTH , Minn. — Minnesota Gov . Tim Walz marked the 100th anniversary of a painful chapter in Duluth history by visiting a memorial to three black men lynched by a white mob .
Elias Clayton , Elmer Jackson and Isaac McGhie were traveling circus workers accused of raping a white woman , though her doctor later found no evidence of assault .

DENVER — Former Colorado Gov . and current Senate hopeful John Hickenlooper on Monday apologized for jokingly comparing politicians to slaves being whipped to row “ an ancient slave ship . ”
Hickenlooper ’ s apology came after Tay Anderson , a black Denver school board member who has been instrumental in organizing protests after the death of George Floyd , tweeted a video of Hickenlooper making the quip Monday morning .

Hickenlooper ’ s campaign said the video Anderson tweeted was from 2014 but did not specify the event at which the then-governor was speaking .

He says the schedulers are the people who lashed slaves to keep them rowing the ship . “ We elected officials are the ones rowing , ” Hickenlooper said .

TAMPA , Fla. — More than five dozen peaceful protesters in Florida who were arrested earlier this month for unlawful assembly while demonstrating against police abuse following the death of George Floyd in Minnesota won ’ t be prosecuted , a State Attorney said Monday .
State Attorney Andrew Warren in Tampa said that his office won ’ t be filing charges against 67 protesters who were arrested two weeks ago in downtown Tampa .
The prosecutor ’ s office will also work to expunge the arrest records of the protesters who were taken into custody , he said .
“ In these unlawful assembly cases , there is no value in filing charges , ” Warren said at a news conference . “ Prosecuting people for exercising their First Amendment rights creates problems rather than solving them . It can weaken the bonds between law enforcement and the community , while undermining faith in our system . ”
Warren warned , though , that his office would prosecute anybody who takes advantage of the protests to cause destruction or commit crimes . He said his office is still reviewing another 133 arrests starting from the night of May 30 , including cases of arson and vandalism from that night when a gas station was set ablaze and store windows were smashed .
Under Florida law , an “ unlawful assembly ” is a gathering of three or more people with a “ common unlawful purpose ” that must have an “ intent to do an unlawful act which threatens the peace . ”
“ There was no evidence that anyone was intending to commit a crime , ” Warren said . “ They were just there to protest . ”

SEOUL, South Korea — A large Black Lives Matter banner has been removed from the U.S. Embassy building in South Korea’s capital three days after it was raised there in solidarity with protesters back home.

The banner was put up Saturday, with Ambassador Harry Harris tweeting that his embassy “stands in solidarity with fellow Americans grieving and peacefully protesting to demand positive change.” But the banner was removed Monday and another banner commemorating the Korean War was on display Tuesday.

The embassy said the banner’s removal was meant to avoid any misperception that it aimed to encourage donations for certain unspecified organizations.

Harris “wanted to highlight the enduring American values of racial equality, freedom of speech, and the right to peacefully protest,” the U.S. Embassy said in a statement. “However, the Ambassador’s intent was not to support or encourage donations to any specific organization. To avoid the misperception that American taxpayer dollars were spent to benefit such organizations, he directed that the banner be removed.”

SEATTLE — The Seattle City Council has voted unanimously to bar police from using tear gas, pepper spray and several other crowd control devices after officers repeatedly used them on mostly peaceful demonstrators protesting racism and police brutality.

The 9-0 vote Monday came amid frustration with the Seattle Police Department, which used tear gas to disperse protesters in the city’s densest neighborhood, Capitol Hill, just days after Mayor Jenny Durkan and Chief Carmen Best promised not to.

The council heard repeated complaints from residents forced out of their homes by the gas even though they weren’t protesting; one resident said his wife doused their child’s eyes with breast milk.

A federal judge on Friday issued a temporary order banning Seattle police from using tear gas, pepper spray, foam-tipped projectiles or other force against protesters, finding that the department had used less-lethal weapons “disproportionately and without provocation,” chilling free speech in the process.

NEW YORK — New York City’s police department is disbanding the type of plainclothes anti-crime units that were involved in the 2014 death of Eric Garner and have long been criticized for aggressive tactics, Commissioner Dermot Shea said Monday.

The NYPD’s anti-crime units, which focused primarily on seizing illegal guns, were responsible for a disproportionate number of shootings and complaints, Shea told reporters after meeting with top deputies to discuss the move.

The change comes amid a nationwide reckoning over police brutality.

Garner died when an officer enforcing a ban on the sale of loose cigarettes used a chokehold to wrestle him to the ground.

About 600 officers working in the unit will be given new assignments.

WASHINGTON — A senior administration official says an executive order that President Donald Trump is expected to sign Tuesday would set up a database for tracking police officers who have complaints about excessive use of force in their records.

The official says the administration wants to keep officers with complaints in their record from moving from one police department to the next.

The president’s executive order comes as lawmakers work quickly in response to outrage over the death of George Floyd. Senate Republicans are also poised to unveil an extensive package of policing changes.

Administration officials say the executive order would also establish a national credentialing system that would give police departments a financial incentive to adopt best practices on such things as use of deadly force and prohibiting the use of chokeholds, except in situations when deadly force is allowed by law.

The official says that cities such as Minneapolis and Baltimore “are not using the most modern standards” when it comes to their training materials.

Two officials briefed reporters on the executive order on the condition that they not be identified. The officials said they expect the major law enforcement trade groups to back the effort.

PARIS — Under pressure from police, the French government has backed away from a ban on chokeholds during arrests.

France’s interior minister announced a week ago that the maneuver would be abandoned, in the face of growing French protests over police brutality and racial injustice unleashed by George Floyd’s death in the U.S.

But French police responded with five straight days of counterprotests, arguing that the ban deprived them of a key tool to subdue unruly suspects.

On Monday, the national police director sent a letter to police, obtained by The Associated Press, saying chokeholds will no longer be taught in police schools but can continue to be used “with discernment” until alternatives are found.

Police unions hailed the reversal.

RICHMOND, Va. — Six property owners in Virginia’s capital city of Richmond have filed a lawsuit seeking to stop Gov. Ralph Northam’s administration from removing a towering statue there to Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.

The lawsuit challenges Northam’s authority to order removal of the Lee statue from Monument Avenue in the ex-capital of the Confederacy.

Northam’s spokeswoman says the governor considers the statue a “divisive symbol.” The governor recently ordered its removal, citing the pain gripping the country over the death in police custody of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis.

Richmond’s Confederate monuments became rallying points for protesters in recent days.

Last week, demonstrators toppled a statue of Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederacy, that was part of a much larger monument.

LAS VEGAS — A former U.S. Marine has been charged with impersonating a federal officer after the man was armed and wearing tactical gear as he stood alongside police at a protest in Las Vegas last month.

A criminal complaint alleges Zachary Sanns was wearing plain clothes with a tactical vest, helmet and belt, a balaclava, a stun gun and two firearms as he appeared near the front line May 30 with police as they faced off with people protesting the death of George Floyd.

He is charged with one count of false impersonation of an officer or employee of the United States. Sanns’ attorney declined to comment.

RICHMOND, Va. — Richmond police say one protester was arrested after an overnight demonstration outside police headquarters turned violent and three officers were injured.

The confrontation began Sunday night and extended into the early morning hours Monday as hundreds of protesters gathered outside police headquarters to protest an earlier incident in which a police car struck several protesters blocking its path.

No one appeared to be injured in that incident.

In a statement released Monday afternoon, Chief William Smith said some demonstrators threw rocks and other objects at police officers.

Smith said several city vehicles were heavily damaged, several privately owned buildings in the area were vandalized and numerous dumpster fires were set.

Protests against police brutality have rocked the U.S. since the death of George Floyd on May 25.

LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — Retail giant Walmart closed some of its locations in Arkansas after Black Lives Matter demonstrators gathered outside of stores in an effort to shutter them in wake of George Floyd’s killing in Minneapolis.

The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports that four Walmart stores and a Sam’s Club closed on Sunday in Little Rock. The international corporation is based in the state.

Activist Dawn Jeffrey tells protesters at a Walmart location while live streaming on Facebook that they were done with the “wicked Waltons.”

She notes how the founding family takes too much money from the community and invests in private prisons.

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump says he wants the governor of Washington to call in the National Guard to deal with demonstrators in Seattle, saying “the problem with what happened in Seattle is it spreads, and all of a sudden they’ll say ‘let’s do some other city and lets do another one.’”

Trump is also suggesting that he’s got several options for dealing with demonstrators who have staked out several blocks near downtown Seattle after officers withdrew from a police station following violent confrontations. They named it the “Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone.”

Speaking to reporters at the White House, Trump says “the American public is very angered by that.”

Trump also complained that media organizations are not dedicating adequate attention to what’s happened in Seattle.

He said that if “the right ever took over a city, conservative Republicans took over a city, it would be the biggest story in history.”

Trump also spent several minutes criticizing Gov. Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan, calling her “scared stiff.”

“If they don’t do the job, I’ll do the job,” Trump said, declining a request to provide specifics.

BOSTON — A long-running New England television show spotlighting local restaurants and food has been taken off air after its CEO mocked the nationwide protests against police brutality on social media.

Boston-based stations WBZ-TV and WSBK-TV said in a statement Sunday that Phantom Gourmet, which first aired in the early 1990s, has been placed “on hiatus pending further review.”

Dave Andelman, the show’s CEO and co-host, took jabs at participants of the Black Lives Matter movement in a number of recent posts on his personal Facebook account.

He mockingly called for defunding “potatoes, not police” and suggested Boston restaurants and retailers “offer touchless, curbside looting,” in reference to the violence and destruction that followed a recent downtown protest.

DULUTH, Minn. — Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz marked the 100th anniversary of a painful chapter in Duluth history by visiting a memorial to three black men lynched by a white mob.

Elias Clayton, Elmer Jackson and Isaac McGhie were traveling circus workers accused of raping a white woman, though her doctor later found no evidence of assault.

Walz gestured Monday to the corner where the men were lynched, and said Minnesota’s “inability to deal with that led to what happened down there,” pointing southward toward Minneapolis, where George Floyd died after being arrested by police.

Walz made the same connection on Friday, when he and two other members of the state pardons board granted a posthumous pardon to Max Mason, a fourth circus worker convicted in the case despite what a prosecutor at the time called weak evidence.

Walz is now pressing for major policing reforms in a special session of the state Legislature. The Star Tribune reports that Walz said his goal is to change law in ways that activists say will make a difference in their lives. Walz said the state will “be defined either by the murder of George Floyd or by how we respond to the murder of George Floyd.”

New Jersey police must divulge the names of law enforcement officers who commit serious disciplinary violations, Attorney General Gurbir Grewal ordered Monday.

The state’s top law enforcement official said in a statement that the order would apply going forward to all state, county and local law enforcement agencies.

Agencies must publicly identify officers who were fired, demoted or suspended for more than five days because of a disciplinary violation, Grewal said. The first lists must be published by Dec. 31.

Officers’ identities previously were not disclosed publicly unless they faced criminal charges, the attorney general said.

Grewal announced more stringent disclosures affecting the state police.

The names of troopers who have been disciplined in about 430 cases going back to 2000 will be published by July 15, Grewal said.

DENVER — Former Colorado Gov. and current Senate hopeful John Hickenlooper on Monday apologized for jokingly comparing politicians to slaves being whipped to row “an ancient slave ship.”

Hickenlooper’s apology came after Tay Anderson, a black Denver school board member who has been instrumental in organizing protests after the death of George Floyd, tweeted a video of Hickenlooper making the quip Monday morning.

Anderson has endorsed Hickenlooper’s rival, former Colorado House Speaker Andrew Romanoff, in the Democratic Senate primary.

Hickenlooper’s campaign said the video Anderson tweeted was from 2014 but did not specify the event at which the then-governor was speaking.

The video shows a silhouetted Hickenlooper speaking at some sort of gathering with a microphone in his hand about political schedulers. “Imagine an ancient slave ship,” he tells the audience. He says the schedulers are the people who lashed slaves to keep them rowing the ship. “We elected officials are the ones rowing,” Hickenlooper said.

In a statement released through his campaign, Hickenlooper said: “Taking a look at this video from six years ago, I recognize that my comments were painful. I did not intend them to be. I offer my deepest apologies.”

TAMPA, Fla. — More than five dozen peaceful protesters in Florida who were arrested earlier this month for unlawful assembly while demonstrating against police abuse following the death of George Floyd in Minnesota won’t be prosecuted, a State Attorney said Monday.

State Attorney Andrew Warren in Tampa said that his office won’t be filing charges against 67 protesters who were arrested two weeks ago in downtown Tampa.

The prosecutor’s office will also work to expunge the arrest records of the protesters who were taken into custody, he said.

“In these unlawful assembly cases, there is no value in filing charges,” Warren said at a news conference. “Prosecuting people for exercising their First Amendment rights creates problems rather than solving them. It can weaken the bonds between law enforcement and the community, while undermining faith in our system.”

Warren warned, though, that his office would prosecute anybody who takes advantage of the protests to cause destruction or commit crimes. He said his office is still reviewing another 133 arrests starting from the night of May 30, including cases of arson and vandalism from that night when a gas station was set ablaze and store windows were smashed.

Under Florida law, an “unlawful assembly” is a gathering of three or more people with a “common unlawful purpose” that must have an “intent to do an unlawful act which threatens the peace.”

“There was no evidence that anyone was intending to commit a crime,” Warren said. “They were just there to protest.”

More than 57,000 people have signed a petition from the group, the Pittsburgh affiliate of Bend the Arc: A Jewish Partnership for Justice, telling Trump he's not welcome in the city.

But the rabbi at Tree of Life said that Trump is “always welcome.”

“I’m a citizen. He's my president. He is certainly welcome,” Rabbi Jeffrey Myers said Monday.

It was a chilling split screen at the start of June : President Donald Trump preparing to give an address in the White House Rose Garden as dozens and dozens of protesters right outside were being pushed back on the streets by federal law enforcement firing what appeared to be tear gas .
Similar reports of police using tear gas against protesters have emerged across the United States over the past several days : San Diego , Los Angeles , Detroit , Las Vegas , Orlando . A reporter for the Los Angeles Times in Minneapolis posted a video , her eyes red and raw , describing how Minnesota State Police had blasted her and other journalists at point-blank range with tear gas .
In the United States , what we call “ tear gas ” is often CS gas , a chemical compound credited to two American scientists , Ben Corson and Roger Stoughton , who discovered it in 1928 . ( The C and S in “ CS ” come from the first initial of each man ’ s last name . ) But its use predates that , to the battlefields of World War I — from where it migrated not long after to America ’ s police forces . And there it has stayed , ever since .
Mostly because it was ruthlessly effective . It dispersed crowds and could turn a “ protest into a screaming mob , ” Anna Feigenbaum , an associate professor at Bournemouth University in the United Kingdom , told me .
“ Because it doesn ’ t normally leave blood , there ’ s no trace , ” said Feigenbaum , who is the author of the book Tear Gas : From the Battlefields of World War I to the Streets of Today .
Indeed , tear gas is deemed a “ riot control agent , ” which exempts it from chemical weapons protocols — meaning it can still be used on a city street by domestic police forces , but not by soldiers in a war zone . It is considered a “ less lethal ” weapon , meaning it ’ s not intended to be fatal , but it can , and often does , inflict injury , though how severe often depends on how it ’ s used , and when , and where .
It has become part of the landscape of protests worldwide from the Arab Spring to Hong Kong . So has its aftermath : crowds fleeing slow-moving clouds , the coughing , the choking , the water bottles dumped in stinging eyes . And as unrest engulfs the United States , the scene is repeating itself , again and again .
I spoke with Feigenbaum to better understand the history of tear gas and how it became a tool for police , past and present .
When do we see the first instance of what we would consider “ tear gas ” ?
The long answer , but I ’ ll tell you quickly , is that [ researchers ] think the French police were experimenting with it before World War I . But then World War I is the first major deployment .
After World War I , lots of chemists created all kinds of chemical weapons , and for business reasons — as well as military prestige reasons — people that were involved in that wanted those products to continue to have a life .
So in the United States , the guy who ended up taking over the Chemical Warfare Service — which had been active during the war — went on a mission [ with ] powerful friends in publishing , lawyers , and PR to create a commercial market for tear gas . His name was Gen. Amos Fries .
And from 1919 until the early 1920s , they went to police departments and did displays , the way you would launch any product . They had advertisements taken out in all the places where their audience was . And so by the mid-1920s , tear gas started to be a regular thing in police arsenals . You see a lot of it being used in labor movement repression , mostly in the early ’ 30s .
In the US , is there a first documented case of tear gas being used in a protest , or , as you mentioned , against labor unions or anything like that ?
I don ’ t know which one is the first , but the biggest that is on record is the Bonus Army March of 1932 . That was a gathering of thousands of World War I veterans who had marched to Washington , DC , to claim this money they had been promised . It was during the Great Depression , so people were really broke . You see a lot of similarities to now , the kind of state that America was in .
And the military was called out against these veterans and they mass deployed tear gas . [ The veterans were ] all unarmed . That then both became major news , but also became part of the promotional material for how well the tear gas worked .
“ The ads would run with lines like : ‘ Make a mob terrified and cry screaming ’ ”
Was it initially marketed in the same way we see tear gas used today , for crowd-control purposes ? Or did it evolve from what it was originally intended to be ?
I would say that its use now is exactly the same as its use then , only then they didn ’ t have euphemisms for it . It was just called things like “ blinding , painful poison gas. ” The ads would run with lines like : “ Make a mob terrified and cry screaming . ”
It was very much pitched openly — openly in trade magazines , not sold to the public — as being something police could use quickly , they wouldn ’ t need much training to use . You ’ d be able to win the media war because by firing the tear gas , you turn the protest into a screaming mob that , because it doesn ’ t normally leave blood , there ’ s no trace . You don ’ t look like the bad guy , and you just make the people look disheveled .
So all those kinds of propagandistic ways that tear gas functions — and in addition to the physical ways that it functions — were just a lot more straightforward . Whereas now , you know , normally a company wouldn ’ t claim something like that in any kind of public material .
And so obviously this was happening in the US , but were authorities or police around the world also adopting tear gas as a tool ?
I didn ’ t research into lots of other countries , but France and South Africa were widely using it in the 1920s as well , somewhat for obvious reasons . France had lots of colonial uprisings that it needed repressed , and South Africa , right ?
So it was in European countries and European settler countries , you had the use of tear gas to quell uprisings from colonized people . In the US , it was more the kind of internal colonizing . It very much maps onto a colonial understanding of power . All of those places were using tear gas as part of their apparatus to stay in charge .
So is the substance we know as “ tear gas ” today the same compound as it was in the 1920s ? How much has the compound actually changed ?
They changed them a lot . The stuff that was used in World War I is not used now . They modernized it through various things . The guys [ credited for creating it ] , the CS guys , were scientists who made a product . They weren ’ t that directly involved in the kind of riot control industry , per se . And their compound didn ’ t actually start to get taken up until the 1950s .
The modern CS we use today is not that different from the 1950s version . Every time [ the industry ] makes something new , they say it ’ s for safety . Other times they say it ’ s for greater impact .
But what has really changed is the ways that tear gas is deployed . So we now have all different kinds of sprays . We ’ ve seen on the streets in the United States , both handheld aerosols and the bigger spray bottles that look a little bit like fire extinguishers . So that can be either an aerosol form of CS or it can be a pepper spray . They put all different kinds of chemicals in there .
So just to be clear , there are many things that fall under the heading of “ tear gas ” — like the CS , and also pepper spray ?
Tear gas is not really a thing . Tear gas is just the name for a bunch of different chemicals that have very , very , very slightly different effects than pepper spray .
The thing that we call pepper spray is usually either a synthetic or natural compound , but then has lots of chemicals added to it . And then there ’ s CS , which is the main kind of tear gas that we ’ ve been talking about . And then there ’ s CR and CN , and then there ’ s various other formulas that different places use .
You can have “ gases ” in different forms . It can be liquid , it can be powder . So when we see the devices that spray or shoot a substance , it could have pepper spray or a liquidized aerosol form of tear gas . Then there ’ s also mace , which has its own compound , but it ’ s also a brand name . It ’ s super complicated .
So when we say “ tear gas , ” we are not necessarily referring to one specific thing . It can be many different tools that police are using to do crowd control .
Yes , yes , yes . And then the launchers , the things that are hurting people , are those big canisters that are shot from launchers that dislodge something with tear gas in it .
And so those are the things that have really been innovated in the last 20 years . We ’ re seeing a lot of these [ canisters ] that split apart into multiple pieces , or they bounce , in order to make it harder for protesters to pick them up or throw them out of the way . So those are more modern inventions . They have to do with the dispersal technology , not the formula .
So really the thing that ’ s changed is how tear gas is actually deployed by police forces and authorities worldwide ?
It ’ s those innovations — like , yes , they tweak the formula — but the thing that has made a difference from the perspective of the person being tear-gassed are these different ways of deploying it .
Because if you ’ re making ever faster , ever more powerful multi-launchers that can fire canisters that split into multiple pieces at people , you ’ re much more likely increasing harm , right ? You ’ re increasing [ law enforcement ’ s ] capacity to control that space , from a freedom-of-assembly perspective .
And then things like pepper balls , those little balls that are being rapidly fired like machine guns , they look like paintball guns . Some cities use a lot of those . That ’ s a more modern technology that changes the way that you experience being pepper-sprayed or being tear-gassed .
And how do these new methods of delivery change how people experience being tear-gassed ?
It would depend . The concern people have with the ones that split apart is that you have less accuracy in where you ’ re firing it . The same with the bouncing ones . If it ’ s bouncing around , it ’ s going to be less accurate , where it ’ s firing .
You ’ re supposed to not fire them at people , you ’ re supposed to fire them well in front of people , giving everyone a clear amount of space to disperse after a very clear verbal warning .
Very little of the way we ’ re seeing tear gas being used follows any of the protocol which underlie the fact that it ’ s legal . In the kinds of situations where we ’ re seeing tear gas used in the US right now , the thing that makes it more dangerous is the amount , and how trapped people are in a space .
Can you talk about the legality ? As I understand it , there are some international protocols , including from the United Nations , on the use of tear gas , or riot control agents . But what are the actual underpinnings of the legality , and is it just international protocols or are there federal or state laws , too ?
Internationally , the main regulator would be the OPCW ( Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons ) , and that ’ s the one where you have that exception clause that says that things that are “ riot control agents ” are exempt from the Chemical Weapons Convention , which is what outlaws other kinds of chemical war .
And then a [ police ] precinct could have its own policy or rule . But there ’ s no legally enforced , wide-scale regulation .
What most people in the policy world who are advocating for reform around tear gas want is clear definitions of what kinds of chemicals can be put in the formulas and of what kinds of launchers can be used . Then on the legal side of that , a better way of enforcing misuse .
That would be one of the most dangerous ways of using tear gas . That would be completely against military and police training . That ’ s the kind of thing that the UN use-of-force laws would be wanting to not allow .
So I ’ m understanding now that there ’ s nothing really enforceable , but if I ’ m a police officer who wants to use this for crowd control , what are the steps , if you ’ re going use it “ appropriately ” ?
Again , protocols will change in different places , but first of all , you would have to be under some kind of threat that you couldn ’ t contain , or couldn ’ t change without the use of a less lethal weapon . So that ’ s number one .
That ’ s in the UN ’ s basic principles for the use of force . If you were going to use it because you deemed there was danger , or you felt threatened — which is usually the excuse that US police use — then you would have to give the verbal warning .
You would wait a suitable amount of time for people to actually leave , and then you would fire the tear gas on the ground , a good distance in front of where people are , so that you didn ’ t run the risk of either hitting them with a canister or a grenade , or getting the gas too close to them so that they might have too much of it , too big of a dose .
And the wind would need to be in the right direction . You would need to have multiple clear exit paths for people to get away from it . And anyone who was injured , you would go and care for [ them ] , rather than arresting them .
Do you think some of the anger around the use of tear gas is in part because these protocols are not being followed ? I don ’ t know what you ’ ve seen in your research , but when we see tear gas being used — as in these recent anti-police brutality protests in the US , but also in the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong this summer — are we just seeing bad examples ? Or is it really just a free-for-all ?
Potentially both right now in the US . It ’ s hard for me to judge that because I ’ m not in the US , so I ’ m not even getting that trickle of media that you get when you ’ re there . I ’ m getting just whatever people retweet on Twitter , or whatever ’ s picked up by the major press .
I would say I , personally , have not seen any videos of appropriate use — which doesn ’ t mean they are not somewhere , people following protocol .
And actually , in the early days of the Hong Kong protests , the police were completely following protocol . It was only as the protests escalated over time that you started to see the Hong Kong police get much more violent .
So there are certainly instances , like in the early , early days of Hong Kong , where the police were following protocol to the book . There ’ s also all this tactical formation [ police are ] supposed to do — so there ’ s one guy that ’ s in charge of other guys , and that guy says fire and then that ’ s when you fire .
There ’ s all of this sort of military precision that ’ s supposed to happen . It ’ s not supposed to be just random people shooting constantly . I would say how we saw the use in Turkey [ in anti-Erdogan protests 2013 ] and in Egypt [ in Tahrir Square during the 2011 Arab Spring ] is more like what we ’ re seeing now in the US , just kind of free-for-all .
“ I think you can argue that tear gas , in and of itself , denies people the right to protest and publicly assemble ”
What are the public health consequences of deploying tear gas for protests ?
I think that it ’ s really important to look at it from a public health perspective . It ’ s still questionable what kinds of respiratory damage tear gas does . We don ’ t really know what its impacts are in terms of different kinds of asthma and lung disease .
What we do know is that for people who have any kind of preconditions , it ’ s incredibly dangerous for them to be in spaces that are tear-gassed . For anyone who ’ s very young or very old , it has increased dangers .
So if we think of this as an atmospheric weapon — a weapon that takes over the space of the air — then anybody who is in that space becomes vulnerable to its effects . And so in the same way that we are shielding people who are vulnerable from Covid-19 — you have to think about it in a similar way . You ’ re more likely to be badly impacted by tear gas if you fall into the higher-risk categories .
In that way , it can very much be analyzed in terms of public health framework . And so you might say it ’ s discriminatory — of who ’ s allowed to freely assemble — because it makes certain bodies much , much more vulnerable and therefore denies them that right of participation . I mean , I think you can argue that tear gas , in and of itself , denies people the right to protest and publicly assemble .
Then in terms of its environmental , architectural damage , it ’ s a toxic waste . It ’ s a hazardous material . We are firing it into our parks , into water supplies sometimes . If people have it on them and bring it home , if it goes into any kind of windows that are open , if it goes in people ’ s homes , all of that . You ’ re basically just spreading a toxic waste material into public and private spaces .
If you look at the police protocol for how to decontaminate from pepper spray or tear gas exposure , it ’ s incredibly meticulous . It refers to it as being highly dangerous . And yet , when it ’ s used against the public , no such provision is given for cleaning any of these spaces or decontaminating any of these spaces .
Given that , has there been any kind of real movement or push to rethink how tear gas is being used ?
From an activist perspective , after Occupy , the War Resisters League had a Facing Tear Gas campaign . And that , I think , was the first concerted effort in the US to call out the companies or the manufacturers , and so that got on the map that you could have corporate activism against manufacturers of tear gas .
We really saw that then come back with the Warren Kanders/Whitney Museum thing that happened with Decolonize This Place . Kanders , who runs the Safariland Group , which was the tear gas used against the migrant caravan [ along the US southern border ] , that ended up sparking this movement to try to get him off of the board of the Whitney . And then all these artists got involved , and he had to resign .
So that is a good example of using corporate activism that had its foundation in the post-Occupy [ movement ] — and , I mean , the actual organizers are kind of the same people . There was a trajectory there of thinking about how to intervene through that route .
And after Ferguson , there was a lawsuit where protesters won . But what they won was the thing that ’ s supposed to be protocol anyway : They won the police department agreeing to the fact that they should give a verbal warning and let people leave a space . It was a kind of one step forward , two steps back .
“ You ’ re basically just spreading a toxic waste material into public and private spaces ”
It seems like most of that has been activist-led . Have there been any police departments or authorities who ’ ve had an internal reckoning about the use of tear gas ?
Only in the offhand that , you know , occasionally someone who ’ s a police trainer will get in touch with me and be like , “ I use a different kind of training in mine . ”
The other thing , and I don ’ t know enough about the internal operations of US police departments , but the tactical squad that gets called out for riot control is not the whole police force .
So I would imagine that , internally to a police department , you have some issues between who ’ s on the tactical squad and why , and people who are beat cops , desk cops , or whatever . Police departments also have all of their own complicated hierarchies and systems going on , right ?
What strikes me most is that a police officer can use tear gas , but it can ’ t be used in warfare . Can you explain this disconnect ?
Things that are classified as riot control agents are exempt from the ban on using chemical weapons and there ’ s also part of that exemption , which is about defensive versus offensive force . The idea is that if tear gas is used in war , it would be a part of an offensive [ operation ] , whereas when the police use tear gas , it is defensive .
Obviously the protests are complicated , and I ’ m not unsympathetic to the fact that there may be situations where a police officer might feel they need more tools to control a crowd . So is there a better way than tear gas ? Does something exist that might do the same job , but also be more protective of the public ?
The situation that we ’ re in now is a result of so many failures of democracy . The solution for this is real democracy , is listening to people , is taking people seriously , treating people as humans . By the time that you need to be deploying riot control squads against your own people on this scale , you ’ ve had a massive democratic failure .
So I think the problem here , and in many of these instances , like Ferguson , where we see this kind of [ police ] deployment and deployment of the National Guard , is that there ’ s been a massive failure in the very meaning of democracy , of people participating in their own governing and people participating in the society that they live in .
The solution to that is not better police equipment or more police . It is less police equipment , less police , and more democracy , more ways of guaranteeing people ’ s basic rights and freedoms .
To that point , is there something about the use of tear gas in this moment in time that strikes you as particularly unique ? Or is this just a reprise of history ?
I would say that it ’ s a reprise of history , but it ’ s a reprise of white supremacist moments in history .
This kind of unashamed , full-force , no-apology use of the police to protect a minority elite in power with no concern for the cost of doing that , has been something that — as I ’ ve watched the news — is eerily reminiscent of a few previous moments in history where we had white supremacists in positions of power that deployed the police en masse .
My last question is a practical one : If people are concerned about the use of tear gas , where should they start ? How should people advocate , and is there a worthwhile policy change to pursue ?
I think the current move to defund police departments , and to force police departments to be much more transparent about where their budgets are going .
In most police departments , you can ’ t line-item how much riot control equipment is being bought , or armor or training . I think , first , that kind of data transparency and defunding that kind of aspect of policing . I think the movement that is happening right now is really important , that we need to stop talking about reform and start talking about defunding .
And , you know , I think , in a very practical way , funding your street medics , making sure that street medics are equipped and are safe .
Then , as we saw with Kanders and the Whitney , I think corporate-based activism , more outing of these manufacturers , more outing of who they are and how they profit off these moments .

And as unrest engulfs the United States, the scene is repeating itself, again and again.

I spoke with Feigenbaum to better understand the history of tear gas and how it became a tool for police, past and present.

Our conversation, edited for length and clarity, is below.

Jen Kirby

When do we see the first instance of what we would consider “tear gas”?

Anna Feigenbaum

The long answer, but I’ll tell you quickly, is that [researchers] think the French police were experimenting with it before World War I. But then World War I is the first major deployment.

And from 1919 until the early 1920s, they went to police departments and did displays, the way you would launch any product.

So when we say “tear gas,” we are not necessarily referring to one specific thing. It can be many different tools that police are using to do crowd control.

Because if you’re making ever faster, ever more powerful multi-launchers that can fire canisters that split into multiple pieces at people, you’re much more likely increasing harm, right? You’re increasing [law enforcement’s] capacity to control that space, from a freedom-of-assembly perspective.

And then things like pepper balls, those little balls that are being rapidly fired like machine guns, they look like paintball guns. Some cities use a lot of those. That’s a more modern technology that changes the way that you experience being pepper-sprayed or being tear-gassed.

Jen Kirby

And how do these new methods of delivery change how people experience being tear-gassed?

Anna Feigenbaum

It would depend. The concern people have with the ones that split apart is that you have less accuracy in where you’re firing it. The same with the bouncing ones. If it’s bouncing around, it’s going to be less accurate, where it’s firing.

You’re supposed to not fire them at people, you’re supposed to fire them well in front of people, giving everyone a clear amount of space to disperse after a very clear verbal warning.

Very little of the way we’re seeing tear gas being used follows any of the protocol which underlie the fact that it’s legal. In the kinds of situations where we’re seeing tear gas used in the US right now, the thing that makes it more dangerous is the amount, and how trapped people are in a space.

Jen Kirby

Can you talk about the legality? As I understand it, there are some international protocols, including from the United Nations, on the use of tear gas, or riot control agents. But what are the actual underpinnings of the legality, and is it just international protocols or are there federal or state laws, too?

Anna Feigenbaum

Internationally, the main regulator would be the OPCW (Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons), and that’s the one where you have that exception clause that says that things that are “riot control agents” are exempt from the Chemical Weapons Convention, which is what outlaws other kinds of chemical war.

And then a [police] precinct could have its own policy or rule. But there’s no legally enforced, wide-scale regulation.

What most people in the policy world who are advocating for reform around tear gas want is clear definitions of what kinds of chemicals can be put in the formulas and of what kinds of launchers can be used. Then on the legal side of that, a better way of enforcing misuse.

For example, if you’ve seen the video [editor’s note: the video appears to show police firing tear gas at protesters near Philadelphia on June 1] where protesters are fired at and they’re all trying to run up this hill, on the side of a road, and they have literally nowhere to go, and they’re just being pummeled.

That would be one of the most dangerous ways of using tear gas. That would be completely against military and police training. That’s the kind of thing that the UN use-of-force laws would be wanting to not allow.

Jen Kirby

So I’m understanding now that there’s nothing really enforceable, but if I’m a police officer who wants to use this for crowd control, what are the steps, if you’re going use it “appropriately”?

Anna Feigenbaum

Again, protocols will change in different places, but first of all, you would have to be under some kind of threat that you couldn’t contain, or couldn’t change without the use of a less lethal weapon. So that’s number one.

That’s in the UN’s basic principles for the use of force. If you were going to use it because you deemed there was danger, or you felt threatened — which is usually the excuse that US police use — then you would have to give the verbal warning.

You would wait a suitable amount of time for people to actually leave, and then you would fire the tear gas on the ground, a good distance in front of where people are, so that you didn’t run the risk of either hitting them with a canister or a grenade, or getting the gas too close to them so that they might have too much of it, too big of a dose.

And the wind would need to be in the right direction. You would need to have multiple clear exit paths for people to get away from it. And anyone who was injured, you would go and care for [them], rather than arresting them.

Jen Kirby

Do you think some of the anger around the use of tear gas is in part because these protocols are not being followed? I don’t know what you’ve seen in your research, but when we see tear gas being used — as in these recent anti-police brutality protests in the US, but also in the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong this summer — are we just seeing bad examples? Or is it really just a free-for-all?

Anna Feigenbaum

Potentially both right now in the US. It’s hard for me to judge that because I’m not in the US, so I’m not even getting that trickle of media that you get when you’re there. I’m getting just whatever people retweet on Twitter, or whatever’s picked up by the major press.

I would say I, personally, have not seen any videos of appropriate use — which doesn’t mean they are not somewhere, people following protocol.

And actually, in the early days of the Hong Kong protests, the police were completely following protocol. It was only as the protests escalated over time that you started to see the Hong Kong police get much more violent.

So there are certainly instances, like in the early, early days of Hong Kong, where the police were following protocol to the book. There’s also all this tactical formation [police are] supposed to do — so there’s one guy that’s in charge of other guys, and that guy says fire and then that’s when you fire.

There’s all of this sort of military precision that’s supposed to happen. It’s not supposed to be just random people shooting constantly. I would say how we saw the use in Turkey [in anti-Erdogan protests 2013] and in Egypt [in Tahrir Square during the 2011 Arab Spring] is more like what we’re seeing now in the US, just kind of free-for-all.

“I think you can argue that tear gas, in and of itself, denies people the right to protest and publicly assemble”

Jen Kirby

What are the public health consequences of deploying tear gas for protests?

Anna Feigenbaum

I think that it’s really important to look at it from a public health perspective. It’s still questionable what kinds of respiratory damage tear gas does. We don’t really know what its impacts are in terms of different kinds of asthma and lung disease.

What we do know is that for people who have any kind of preconditions, it’s incredibly dangerous for them to be in spaces that are tear-gassed. For anyone who’s very young or very old, it has increased dangers.

So if we think of this as an atmospheric weapon — a weapon that takes over the space of the air — then anybody who is in that space becomes vulnerable to its effects. And so in the same way that we are shielding people who are vulnerable from Covid-19 — you have to think about it in a similar way. You’re more likely to be badly impacted by tear gas if you fall into the higher-risk categories.

In that way, it can very much be analyzed in terms of public health framework. And so you might say it’s discriminatory — of who’s allowed to freely assemble — because it makes certain bodies much, much more vulnerable and therefore denies them that right of participation. I mean, I think you can argue that tear gas, in and of itself, denies people the right to protest and publicly assemble.

Then in terms of its environmental, architectural damage, it’s a toxic waste. It’s a hazardous material. We are firing it into our parks, into water supplies sometimes. If people have it on them and bring it home, if it goes into any kind of windows that are open, if it goes in people’s homes, all of that. You’re basically just spreading a toxic waste material into public and private spaces.

If you look at the police protocol for how to decontaminate from pepper spray or tear gas exposure, it’s incredibly meticulous. It refers to it as being highly dangerous. And yet, when it’s used against the public, no such provision is given for cleaning any of these spaces or decontaminating any of these spaces.

Jen Kirby

Given that, has there been any kind of real movement or push to rethink how tear gas is being used?

Anna Feigenbaum

From an activist perspective, after Occupy, the War Resisters League had a Facing Tear Gas campaign. And that, I think, was the first concerted effort in the US to call out the companies or the manufacturers, and so that got on the map that you could have corporate activism against manufacturers of tear gas.

We really saw that then come back with the Warren Kanders/Whitney Museum thing that happened with Decolonize This Place. Kanders, who runs the Safariland Group, which was the tear gas used against the migrant caravan [along the US southern border], that ended up sparking this movement to try to get him off of the board of the Whitney. And then all these artists got involved, and he had to resign.

So that is a good example of using corporate activism that had its foundation in the post-Occupy [movement] — and, I mean, the actual organizers are kind of the same people. There was a trajectory there of thinking about how to intervene through that route.

And after Ferguson, there was a lawsuit where protesters won. But what they won was the thing that’s supposed to be protocol anyway: They won the police department agreeing to the fact that they should give a verbal warning and let people leave a space. It was a kind of one step forward, two steps back.

“You’re basically just spreading a toxic waste material into public and private spaces”

Jen Kirby

It seems like most of that has been activist-led. Have there been any police departments or authorities who’ve had an internal reckoning about the use of tear gas?

Anna Feigenbaum

Only in the offhand that, you know, occasionally someone who’s a police trainer will get in touch with me and be like, “I use a different kind of training in mine.”

The other thing, and I don’t know enough about the internal operations of US police departments, but the tactical squad that gets called out for riot control is not the whole police force.

So I would imagine that, internally to a police department, you have some issues between who’s on the tactical squad and why, and people who are beat cops, desk cops, or whatever. Police departments also have all of their own complicated hierarchies and systems going on, right?

Jen Kirby

What strikes me most is that a police officer can use tear gas, but it can’t be used in warfare. Can you explain this disconnect?

Anna Feigenbaum

Things that are classified as riot control agents are exempt from the ban on using chemical weapons and there’s also part of that exemption, which is about defensive versus offensive force. The idea is that if tear gas is used in war, it would be a part of an offensive [operation], whereas when the police use tear gas, it is defensive.

Jen Kirby

Obviously the protests are complicated, and I’m not unsympathetic to the fact that there may be situations where a police officer might feel they need more tools to control a crowd. So is there a better way than tear gas? Does something exist that might do the same job, but also be more protective of the public?

Anna Feigenbaum

The situation that we’re in now is a result of so many failures of democracy. The solution for this is real democracy, is listening to people, is taking people seriously, treating people as humans. By the time that you need to be deploying riot control squads against your own people on this scale, you’ve had a massive democratic failure.

So I think the problem here, and in many of these instances, like Ferguson, where we see this kind of [police] deployment and deployment of the National Guard, is that there’s been a massive failure in the very meaning of democracy, of people participating in their own governing and people participating in the society that they live in.

The solution to that is not better police equipment or more police. It is less police equipment, less police, and more democracy, more ways of guaranteeing people’s basic rights and freedoms.

Jen Kirby

To that point, is there something about the use of tear gas in this moment in time that strikes you as particularly unique? Or is this just a reprise of history?

Anna Feigenbaum

I would say that it’s a reprise of history, but it’s a reprise of white supremacist moments in history.

This kind of unashamed, full-force, no-apology use of the police to protect a minority elite in power with no concern for the cost of doing that, has been something that — as I’ve watched the news — is eerily reminiscent of a few previous moments in history where we had white supremacists in positions of power that deployed the police en masse.

Jen Kirby

My last question is a practical one: If people are concerned about the use of tear gas, where should they start? How should people advocate, and is there a worthwhile policy change to pursue?

Anna Feigenbaum

I think the current move to defund police departments, and to force police departments to be much more transparent about where their budgets are going.

In most police departments, you can’t line-item how much riot control equipment is being bought, or armor or training. I think, first, that kind of data transparency and defunding that kind of aspect of policing. I think the movement that is happening right now is really important, that we need to stop talking about reform and start talking about defunding.

And, you know, I think, in a very practical way, funding your street medics, making sure that street medics are equipped and are safe.

Then, as we saw with Kanders and the Whitney, I think corporate-based activism, more outing of these manufacturers, more outing of who they are and how they profit off these moments.

Background [ edit ]

Terence Crutcher in August 2014

(b. August 16, 1976) was a 40-year-old black man.[1][2][3] Crutcher's sister described him as a father and said that, at the time of his death, he was enrolled to study music at Tulsa Community College.[4] According to her, he was also involved in his church and sang in the choir.[ citation needed ].

The officers involved in the incident at Tulsa, Oklahoma, on September 16, 2016, were Betty Shelby and Tyler Turnbough, both of whom are white.[5] Turnbough became an officer in 2009 and Shelby in 2011.[2][3]

Incident [ edit ]

At 7:36 p.m.[5] on September 16, 2016, police received a 9-1-1 call about an abandoned vehicle in the middle of 36th Street North just west of Lewis Avenue.[6][7][8][9] One caller said: ""Somebody left their vehicle running in the middle of the street with the doors wide open."" ""The doors are open. The vehicle is still running. It's an SUV. It's like in the middle of the street. It's blocking traffic."" ""There was a guy running from it, saying it was going to blow up. But I think he's smoking something. I got out and was like, 'Do you need help?'"" ""He was like, 'Come here, come here, I think it's going to blow up.'""[citation needed] The other caller said: ""There is a car that looks like somebody just jumped out of it and left it in the center of the road on 36th Street North and North Lewis Avenue."" ""It's dead in the middle of the street."" ""It's a Navigator. The driver-side door is open like somebody jumped out. It's on the yellow line, blocking traffic. Nobody in the car.""[10]

Police stated that Crutcher kept reaching into his pocket, refused to show his hands, walked towards his vehicle despite being told to stop, and then angled towards and reached into his vehicle.[11][12][13] Critics have disputed this saying that the driver's side window was up when Crutcher was shot.[14] Turnbough tased Crutcher, and Shelby shot him.[5] Shortly before the shooting, officers in the helicopter conversed with each other: ""This guy's still walking and isn't following commands.""

""That looks like a bad dude, too, could be on something.""[4][5][7] Approximately two minutes after the shot, an officer checked Crutcher's pockets, and approximately 45 seconds later, someone crouched to offer aid.[7] Police said Crutcher died in the hospital later that day.[1][5] Tulsa police chief Chuck Jordan said no weapon was recovered from Crutcher's body or vehicle.[15]

Immediate aftermath [ edit ]

Police dashcam and helicopter video as well as the dispatch audio were released by police on September 19, 2016.[1][5] Tulsa Police Chief Chuck Jordan called the video ""disturbing"" and ""difficult to watch"".[5] The officers involved were placed on paid administrative leave.[5]

Crutcher's sister said at a press conference, ""You all want to know who that big, bad dude was? That big, bad dude was my twin brother. That big, bad dude was a father. That big, bad dude was a son. That big, bad dude was enrolled at Tulsa Community College — just wanting to make us proud. That big, bad dude loved God.

The Tulsa Police Department started a criminal investigation of the shooting.[17] Homicide Sergeant Dave Walker stated that PCP had been recovered from Crutcher's car.[18] Shelby's attorney had previously stated that she thought Crutcher might be under the influence of PCP based on what she learned during her drug-recognition training.[13][18] Crutcher's father had stated in a 2012 affidavit that his son had a history of PCP use.[18][19] The police department paid $216,000 in overtime costs for 10 days after the death for services related to increased demonstrations, staffing of patrols, marches, Crutcher's funeral and news conferences by the district attorney and Crutcher family during which the Incident Management Team also had a command post operating.[20]

Reactions [ edit ]

The United States Department of Justice opened a civil rights probe into the shooting.[3][15] However, the Department of Justice later determined that no civil rights charge would be filed against any individual involved. [21][22]

Dozens of protestors gathered on September 19 by the courthouse.[3][23] Ahead of the release of the video and audio recordings, the Tulsa chapter of Black Lives Matter held a protest outside the courthouse.[5]

Crutcher's family, protestors, and the American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma called for Shelby to be charged with his death.[23][24]

Autopsy results [ edit ]

Autopsy results released by the Oklahoma State Medical Examiner indicated that Terence Crutcher had ""acute phencyclidine (PCP) intoxication"" at the time of the shooting. The report stated that Crutcher had 96 nanograms per milliliter of PCP in his blood at the time of death.[25] The report also indicated that tenocyclidine (TCP), a psychostimulant and hallucinogen which is more potent than PCP, was present.[26]

JUAN GONZÁLEZ : We begin today ’ s show looking at police killings of two African-American men—one in Tulsa and one in Charlotte , in North Carolina , which was rocked by protests overnight after hundreds took to the street and blocked Interstate 85 to protest the police shooting of 43-year-old African American Lamont Scott . Video shows protesters blocking the highway , where fires were lit . Police in riot gear responded by throwing tear gas at the crowds . Police say about a dozen officers were hurt during the conflict . Protesters were also hurt .
AMY GOODMAN : Keith Lamont Scott was shot and killed around 4:00 p.m. Tuesday after police arrived to serve an arrest warrant for another person at Scott ’ s housing complex . The accounts of the shooting diverge sharply . While the police claim they first tased and then shot Scott because he was armed and “ posed an imminent deadly threat , ” Scott ’ s family says he was not armed—except with a book . They say he had been sitting in his car waiting to pick up his son after school . This is Scott ’ s daughter speaking in a Facebook live video recorded at the scene of the shooting .
LYRIC SCOTT : What are they over there doing ? Shot my [ bleep ] daddy for being black . You little [ bleep ] . Shot my daddy for being black . And look , and they ’ re just standing there , because they—right ? He ’ s [ bleep ] disabled ! How the [ bleep ] he going to shoot y ’ all ? He didn ’ t got no [ bleep ] gun .
JUAN GONZÁLEZ : This comes as police in Tulsa , Oklahoma , have released a video showing a white police officer shooting and killing unarmed 40-year-old African American Terence Crutcher while his hands were in the air . Officer Betty Shelby shot Crutcher around 8:00 p.m. on Friday after his car broke down . Some of the video released Monday came from police helicopter footage , in which one can hear the man in the helicopter saying about Crutcher , quote , “ That looks like a bad dude , too. ” This is a clip from the police footage .
POLICE OFFICER 1 : This guy is still walking and following commands .
POLICE OFFICER 1 : That ’ s—got a feeling that ’ s about to happen .
POLICE OFFICER 2 : That looks like a bad dude , too . Could be on something .
POLICE OFFICER 1 : Police 1 , they ’ re facing westbound . I think he may have just been tasered .
POLICE OFFICER 3 : Adam 3-21 , we have shots fired . We have one suspect down . We need EMSA here .
POLICE OFFICER 2 : They need to—they need to get this eastbound closed down , if they could , because they ’ re not going to be able to let anybody—
AMY GOODMAN : Other footage from a police dash cam vehicle shows Crutcher walking slowly away from officers with his hands in the air , then putting his hands on the side of his own car as he ’ s surrounded by officers . The video captures a voice coming over the police radio saying , “ He ’ s just been tasered , ” and then a woman ’ s voice yelling “ Shots fired ! ” as the video shows Crutcher ’ s arms falling to the pavement . The Justice Department says it ’ s investigating the shooting of Terence Crutcher as a possible civil rights violation . On Tuesday , hundreds gathered outside the Tulsa Police Department to demand the firing of Officer Betty Shelby .
For more , we ’ re joined here in New York by Vince Warren , executive director of the Center for Constitutional Rights . On the phone with us , Bree Newsome , artist and activist . Last year , armed only with a helmet and climbing gear , she scaled the 30-foot flagpole on the South Carolina state Capitol grounds and unhooked the Confederate flag . As police officers shouted at her to come down , Bree shimmied to the top of the flagpole , took the flag in her hand and said , quote , “ You come against me with hatred . I come against you in the name of God . This flag comes down today. ” She is joining us—she is from Charlotte , North Carolina . And via ███ ! video stream in Washington , D.C. , Rashad Robinson , executive director of Color of Change , who ’ s launched a new petition called “ Terence Crutcher died for being Black . Indict Officer Betty Shelby . ”
So , we welcome you all to ███ ! Bree , I want to begin with you . These riots that broke—you could call them uprisings , riots of fear and anger , protests in Charlotte , North Carolina , that took place after the killing , the police killing , can you talk about what you understand—you ’ re not there now , but what you understood took place ?
BREE NEWSOME : Yeah , absolutely . I think what took place in Charlotte , North Carolina—and I am in contact with folks who are on the ground there , who were there—is what we have witnessed several times in the past two years , what we ’ ve witnessed in America since the '60s , at least , and this is an incident of police brutality , that in many ways is the camel breaking—I 'm sorry , the straw breaking the camel ’ s back kind of moment . Like many cities around the nation , in Charlotte we have a real issue of wealth inequality . We ’ ve had several incidents of police brutality . One of the most notable cases was the case of Jonathan Ferrell . This was a young man who was gunned down by police . He was also unarmed . He had crashed his car and was looking for help , knocked on a door ; the police showed up and killed him . There was an acquittal in that case . So , like so many other cases , this moment that happened last night , this was not an isolated incident . This is a tipping point , a kind of boiling-over moment , for the city and for the nation , in a lot of ways . Folks are not just reacting to what happened in Charlotte , but also to what happened in Tulsa and what happened in Baton Rouge .
JUAN GONZÁLEZ : And , Vince Warren , the issue of—especially in Tulsa , a couple of things are quite different about this . One , we got the identity of the officer right away , and also the video surfaced pretty quickly , as opposed to in other instances there ’ s been battles over even getting the videos that the police have available to the public .
VINCENT WARREN : Yeah , a couple of things on that . That was significant , and I think it ’ s really important . Let ’ s be clear that the police departments don ’ t do this out of the kindness of their hearts ; they do it because of political pressure . So it ’ s exactly these types of protests that we ’ re seeing today , it ’ s the independent journalists that are fighting for these things , make it politically hard for police departments not to put those things forward .
I ’ d also want to point out that the Tulsa situation highlights a central problem with policing , of black communities , in particular , which is that they ’ re trained to see noncompliance as escalation . So they ask you to do something ; if you don ’ t do it , then the police departments increase the use of force . Then , of course , they have to try to justify that use of force afterwards . The good thing about having these video situations is that all of us can see for ourselves what really happened . So , I ’ m at this point now , with the 193rd killing of a black man this year , where I am not inclined—
VINCENT WARREN : One hundred ninety-three , according to The Guardian count . You know , different people have different counts . It ’ s amazing to me that nobody in America can tell me specifically how many black people have been killed by police officers . But after 193 , I am quite prepared not to believe the police department narratives about anything that happened , and these investigations and eyewitness reports become much more important .
AMY GOODMAN : Rashad Robinson , what do you understand about what took place in Tulsa ? I mean , the protests that have been taking place there , coming out—on Monday , the video being released by the police , this helicopter footage , which is truly remarkable , showing Terence Crutcher with his hands in the air , walking very slowly—his car had broken down—to his car and then putting his hands on the car . The windows were up on this car .
RASHAD ROBINSON : Yeah . What we—what we understand is just how much black people are not seen with humanity . You know , Vincent was absolutely right : This video was not released out of the goodness of the hearts of the local police department in Tulsa ; it was released because they knew they had to start figuring out how to get ahead of this story , because the video is simply that bad . And in situations like this , over and over again , we watch as police departments concoct stories . And now we ’ re seeing , you know , stories about drugs , stories with—they would have not known that , you know , he had drugs in the car , if he in fact did—all these reasons that try to legitimize the fact that the police were unable to sort of de-escalate and solve the situation , unable to figure out a story that makes it OK that a gun was pulled out and a man was shot dead . And police officers stood around for a while as this man laid on the ground , and did not even try to get him medical help . This speaks to the ongoing way that , from the start , black people are never given the benefit of the doubt , are not seen as human , are seen as enemy combatants and , even in their death , are seen as deserving—not deserving medical support and deserving of the situations .
This officer needs to be fired , because we continue to come to these conversations , where people want communities to come together , they want unity , they want conversations , and we don ’ t get sort of the results that actually send a message to police officers that they ’ ll be held accountable . But we also need to have a larger conversation , because this is not about one bad apple or two bad apples . This is about systemic problems in police departments around the country , incentive structures that make it OK and incentivize the killing of black people over and over and over again , and no one is held accountable .
AMY GOODMAN : I think—I think this is a very telling comment from a protester , extremely angry last night , in Charlotte , North Carolina .
NICHELLE DUNLAP : A terrorist , New Jersey , New York , he was taken alive . They say they wanted to question him . So , because of you wanting to question him , does his life mean more than our black men across the nation ?
AMY GOODMAN : So , there you have a SOT from CNN , Vince Warren , where she says , “ You ’ re telling me that you do not kill a man who is being referred to as a terrorist in New York , you can take him alive , because you want him for questioning , but an African-American man , you shoot dead . ”
VINCENT WARREN : Absolutely . That is the—that is the precise question that I think Rashad and Bree and I are talking about , that black lives are so dehumanized , that it is OK structurally—it is OK within the context of the police department , it ’ s OK in the context of the criminal justice system—to kill black people . And , you know , the reason why I think the Color of Change petition is so important is that a police officer is the only job in America where you can kill somebody and then you get desk duty . Desk duty almost becomes the default mechanism . If you asked anybody what ’ s going to happen with these cases , people don ’ t believe that this police officer—either of these police officers are going to face serious charges or they ’ re going to get indicted or they ’ re going to get convicted or they ’ re going to get sentenced . People don ’ t believe it . We ’ ve lost complete faith in the system , because the system is designed to do the exact opposite of what black people need .
JUAN GONZÁLEZ : And , Rashad Robinson , what about the issue of now the Justice Department jumping in right away , saying they ’ re going to do an investigation ? We ’ ve seen this happen , time after time , after many of these shootings . And what inevitably happens is , the Justice Department almost always decides there ’ s no criminal offense that , even on the civil rights violations , they can prosecute .
RASHAD ROBINSON : Well , this is part of the structural problem , change that we need . The Justice Department actually doesn ’ t have a real budget for these type of investigations . And this is part of the problem . And currently , the standard is so high for the Justice Department to bring charges , that over and over in these situations they may actually find problems that—and situations in which police departments or individual police acted inappropriately , and they can ’ t bring charges , because they can ’ t meet this standard that is sort of so high and so hard to get over that , in fact , it really makes these situations OK over and over again .
And so , part of the long-term systemic work that we have to do—and we ’ ve been working on that , some of those campaigns are on ColorOfChange.org , as well—is , one , that we have to start tying the federal dollars that go into local law departments , local police departments , to their performance , and stop giving huge sums of money to police departments that don ’ t meet basic standards and don ’ t value black lives . If our federal government can defund local schools for not meeting standards , but still give huge block grants to local police departments that do not value our lives , then we are not dealing with the incentive structures and not sort of shifting the power dynamic and forcing real change . And if we don ’ t deal with the fact that the standards are so high that we can never hold anyone accountable , then we will be in this situation five , 10 , 15 years from now . We will have people calling for unity , asking black people to stand down and be peaceful and not be upset , to tell people to give police officers the benefit of the doubt , when black people never get the benefit of the doubt .
AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to ask Bree Newsome—I mean , to remind people , when you climbed that flagpole on the grounds of the Columbia State House in South Carolina and said , “ This flag comes down today , ” the Confederate flag , it was in response to the killing of the Beautiful Nine , the nine people at the Emanuel Church in Charleston , South Carolina , and their pastor , Clementa Pinckney , by a white supremacist who wrapped himself in the Confederate flag . In this case , Bree , you have Keith Lamont Scott in Charlotte , North Carolina , killed by an African-American officer , Brentley Vinson , and in the case of Tulsa , you have a white woman police officer , Betty Shelby , who killed Terence Crutcher . Your response ?
BREE NEWSOME : Yes . I think sometimes there ’ s this type of focus on what is the race of the police officer . That ’ s not the issue . Everyone can participate in white supremacy and in the white supremacist system . And we have to recognize that the policing system in America is rooted in slavery and slave patrols . I would argue that slavery never ended , because in the 13th Amendment it is codified that slavery is legal in cases of criminal punishment . And when we look at history , we look at—we see that as soon as emancipation happened , there was the institution of the Black Codes . And I believe that is the root of mass incarceration and police brutality as it exists today .
I also want to remind everyone that what happened in Charleston last year was also within the context of police brutality , as well . You know , Clementa Pinckney had just succeeded in getting body camera legislation passed in North Charleston in response to the Walter Scott case . So , there is a—I mean , police brutality has always been woven throughout the story of civil rights and the struggle for equality in America . It ’ s always been there . This issue is as old as policing in America .
AMY GOODMAN : And , of course , Walter Scott was the man who was stopped for a tail light being out , a traffic stop , and a police officer blew him away as he ran through a park . It was only caught because a bystander flipped open his cellphone and started to film . We ’ re going to leave it there , but , of course , we ’ re going to continue to cover all of this . Bree Newsome , thanks so much for joining us , artist and activist from Charlotte , North Carolina . Vince Warren is the executive director of the Center for Constitutional Rights . And Rashad Robinson is executive director of Color of Change , has launched a petition that is titled “ Terence Crutcher died for being Black . Indict Officer Betty Shelby . ”

In this case, Bree, you have Keith Lamont Scott in Charlotte, North Carolina, killed by an African-American officer, Brentley Vinson, and in the case of Tulsa, you have a white woman police officer, Betty Shelby, who killed Terence Crutcher.

Cops have been caught on video , over and over , assaulting Black Americans — bruising their bodies and breaking their bones during routine encounters that escalated . What makes officers engage in rough arrest tactics that seem unnecessarily brutal ?
Paul Huebl , a 12-year veteran of the Chicago Police Department who now makes a living as a private investigator aiding cops accused of excessive force , says it is a simple matter of control . Police are taught to dominate a situation and get someone in handcuffs as soon as tensions start to flare . If they don ’ t , they risk ending up in a bodybag .

Why do they do it? Cops have been caught on video, over and over, assaulting Black Americans — bruising their bodies and breaking their bones during routine encounters that escalated. What makes officers engage in rough arrest tactics that seem unnecessarily brutal?

Paul Huebl, a 12-year veteran of the Chicago Police Department who now makes a living as a private investigator aiding cops accused of excessive force, says it is a simple matter of control. Police are taught to dominate a situation and get someone in handcuffs as soon as tensions start to flare. If they don’t, they risk ending up in a bodybag.

“If you are gonna use force, you have to use a lot of force, or you are going to die,” Hubel said. “You can’t be a namby pamby.”

Arrests turn violent, Huebl told The Marshall Project, when people ignore officers’ commands and argue their innocence. “Don’t fight the police,” is his solution. “When are these idiots gonna learn that you can’t do this shit?”

Not everyone is so willing to blame the victims or endorse maximum force. But there is a strong consensus among cops, their defense lawyers, prosecutors and law enforcement researchers that Huebl’s diagnosis is correct: police culture is built on a code of asserting dominance above all else.

This ideology of street policing has persisted despite public outcry over the deaths like that of George Floyd and decades of reforms aimed at transforming police from combatants into “guardians.”

“I still have guys who have the warrior mentality,” said Mike Chitwood, the sheriff of Volusia County, Florida. Speaking, at a recent town hall hosted by the Police Executive Research Forum, a Washington D.C. think-tank, he said, “We are working to try to change that. And it’s a battle every day to do that.”

But the survivors don't escape unscathed. Some of the children and adults with developmental disabilities experienced the trauma of being present at a mass shooting. My son, as is relatively common, reacts with real panic to certain kinds of sounds and lights, including close proximity to alarm.

What kind of trauma will disabled children carry forward from this event? And, of course, disabled children are not the only ones at risk for trauma and its consequences.

Battalions of agents were mustered in the lobby of Customs and Border Protection ’ s D.C. headquarters—what in normal times is the path to a food court for federal workers . The Drug Enforcement Administration has been given special powers to enable it to surveil protesters . It is the heaviest show of force in the nation ’ s capital since the protests and riots of the Vietnam War .
As large as the public show of force on D.C. ’ s streets has turned out to be—Bloomberg reported Thursday that the force includes nearly 3,000 law enforcement—it still represents only a tiny sliver of the government ’ s armed agents and officers . The government counts up its law enforcement personnel only every eight years , and all told , at last count in 2016 , the federal government employed over 132,000 civilian law enforcement officers—only about half of which come from the major “ brand name ” agencies like the FBI , ATF , Secret Service , DEA and CBP . The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center , which serves as the general academy for federal agencies who don ’ t have their own specialized training facilities , lists around 80 different agencies whose trainees pass through its doors in Georgia , from the IRS ’ criminal investigators and the Transportation Security Administration 's air marshals to the Offices of the Inspector General for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Railroad Retirement Board . Don ’ t forget the armed federal officers at the Environmental Protection Agency or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ’ s Office of Law Enforcement , whose 150 agents investigate conservation crime like the Tunas Convention Act of 1975 ( 16 USC § 971-971k ) and the Northern Pacific Halibut Act of 1982 ( 16 USC § 773-773k ) .
In and around D.C. , there are more than a score of agency-specific federal police forces , particularly downtown where protests have played out over the past week , nearly every block brings you in contact with a different police force . A morning run around the National Mall and Capitol Hill might see you cross through the jurisdictions of the federal U.S. Capitol Police , the Park Police , the National Gallery of Art police , the Smithsonian Office of Protective Services , the Postal police , Amtrak police , the Bureau of Engraving and Printing police , the Supreme Court police , the Uniformed Division of the Secret Service , the Government Publishing Office police , and the Department of Homeland Security ’ s Federal Protective Service . ( Only recently did the Library of Congress police merge with the Capitol Police across the street into one unit . ) Run a bit farther and you might encounter the FBI Police or the U.S. Mint police . And that ’ s not even counting the multistate Metro Transit police and the local D.C. Metropolitan Police .
The public has little understanding or appreciation for the size of some of these agencies , each of which has its own protocols , training , hiring guidelines and responsibilities . On the lighter side , few tourists know , for instance , that the National Gallery of Art—home to some of the world ’ s most famous artwork—has a shooting range for its police tucked away above its soaring central rotunda . On the darker side , the roughly 20,000 federal prison guards known formally as the Bureau of Prisons—whose riot units make up a sizable chunk of the officers imported to D.C. and who represent the single largest component of federal officers in the Justice Department—are concerning to see on the streets in part because they ’ re largely untrained in civilian law enforcement ; they normally operate in a controlled environment behind bars with sharply limited civil liberties and use-of-force policies that would never fly in a civilian environment .
There are more gun-carrying agents employed across the federal government by inspectors general—the quasi-independent watchdogs responsible for rooting out fraud and abuse of taxpayer dollars—than there are ATF agents nationwide ; the roughly 4,000 inspector general agents nationwide , in fact , is roughly equivalent to the entire size of the DEA . The Department of Veterans Affairs ’ police department , who guard the nation ’ s veteran hospitals , facilities and cemeteries , is larger than the entire U.S . Marshals Service .
Beyond those 132,000 federal civilian law enforcement , the U.S. has tens of thousands of military law enforcement officers , including military police units and investigators like the 2,000 agents of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations , the 1,200 agents of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service or the 900 agents of the Army ’ s Criminal Investigation Division . Plus , the 40,000 armed personnel of the U.S. Coast Guard , which has broad law enforcement powers on the nation ’ s rivers , lakes and oceans , but is counted as part of the military .
Then there are the officers who can be spotted across Northern Virginia in white marked patrol vehicles labeled only as “ United States Police , ” the purposefully vague public name given to what is formally known as the CIA ’ s Security Protective Services , who provide security to the CIA and the Office of Director of National Intelligence . They carry weapons , but have limited law enforcement authority . ( As one agent told me , only half-joking , “ We can ’ t arrest you , but we can kill you . ” )
The list of crimes these agents and officers collectively enforce is endless , so much that a tongue-in-cheek Twitter feed daily shares the most obscure federal criminal penalties . One of this week ’ s examples : “ 21 USC §331 , 333 , 343 & 21 CFR §150.160 ( b ) ( 2 ) make it a federal crime to sell jam made from a combination of more than five fruits. ” It ’ s hard to even say who might even be in charge of enforcing that one—perhaps the agents of the Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations ? ( You should check out its “ Most Wanted ” page , in case you happen to have seen Cellou Jumaine , wanted for importing 990,000 counterfeit tubes of Colgate toothpaste . )
The Justice Department can ’ t even come up with a reliable count of the number of federal crimes on the books to enforce ; it ’ s somewhere north of 3,000 but federal law is so voluminous and convoluted that no one has really tried to count it since 1982 . When I was writing a history of the FBI , the bureau couldn ’ t even tell me the total number of criminal provisions it was specifically responsible for enforcing .
Many federal agencies have broad law enforcement powers—and can end up enforcing laws that wouldn ’ t on the surface appear to have much to do with their stated raison d ’ etre . Fun fact : The vast majority of the total arrests made by the Pentagon police , formally known as the Pentagon Force Protection Agency , are for drunk driving . Roughly every two or three days , an intoxicated driver gets lost in the maze of interstate roads around the Defense Department headquarters and takes a wrong turn into one of its parking lots . Such incidents account for as many as four out of five arrests the PFPA make annually .
The rise of so many specialized federal forces—and so many federal law enforcement officers overall—is a relatively recent phenomenon ; the FBI was unarmed until the mid-1930s and modern incarnations of the DEA and ATF , for example , were only founded in the 1970s , as part of President Richard Nixon ’ s law and order push . Historically , it ’ s not altogether surprising that many of the personnel on D.C. ’ s streets this week have come from the Border Patrol and the Bureau of Prisons , which have long served as the nation ’ s “ surge ” national police force .
What is surprising is that those two agencies now facing down Black Lives Matter and crowds protesting systemic racism historically have been enlisted by the federal government to protect blacks against white protesters . Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy , for instance , deputized officers from the Border Patrol and the Bureau of Prisons to work as U.S. marshals and secure the University of Mississippi in 1962 to protect James Meredith as he enrolled at the school after desegregation . Similarly , the Border Patrol once watched over the Freedom Riders in Alabama and Mississippi in the 1960s .
The biggest—and most troubling—shift in the makeup of federal law enforcement has come in the decades after 9/11 , as the number of armed personnel has surged , law enforcement agencies have proliferated and oversight reins have loosened .
Whereas for years , the Department of Justice—which typically has strict oversight regimes and whose leadership is made up primarily of lawyers and prosecutors—accounted for the bulk of federal officers and agents , the post-9/11 growth of DHS has meant that it alone now accounts for nearly half of all sworn federal law enforcement officers . ( There ’ s even a special 80-person police force within the Federal Emergency Management Agency , a component of DHS , that guards the president ’ s doomsday bunker at Mount Weather in Berryville , Virginia . ) That shift means agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement , which after 9/11 replaced the Justice Department ’ s Immigration and Naturalization Service , are now instead led by a department less grounded in the Constitution and whose leadership is more political appointees than career prosecutors .
More broadly , though , many federal agencies exist with little sustained oversight and continue to struggle with training , recruiting and use of force incidents . The Department of the Interior ’ s Park Police , one of the agencies that has served as the front ranks of the riot security in Lafayette Park , has long been one of the capital region ’ s most troubled law enforcement entities , with complaints and questions about its use of force and even a five-year-long lawsuit over the firing of its police chief after she complained about inadequate staffing . ( This week , D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser , who thanks to the District ’ s odd nonstate status finds herself in the odd position of not controlling the police forces patrolling her own city , blasted the U.S. Park Police and officers from the Secret Service—normally tasked with guarding the White House and foreign embassies in D.C.—for clearing Lafayette Park Monday night to allow Trump to walk across the street for a photo op at St. John ’ s church . ) The Federal Protective Service , which oversees security at 9,000 federal buildings across the country , has been reorganized and reshuffled numerous times since 9/11 , rarely spending more than a few years in the same box on DHS org charts . And after a hiring surge caused it to lower recruiting standards , CBP has struggled with a decade of rampant crime and corruption in its own ranks—so much so that for most of the past decade , a CBP officer or agent was arrested on average every single day—and its use of force has been widely criticized , even by professional policing organizations . ( For a period of time during the Obama administration , the FBI actually declared CBP ’ s corruption was the nation ’ s biggest threat at the border . )
The Bureau of Prisons has been dogged for years with questions about its management , training and tactics . Amid the protests in Minneapolis after the killing of George Floyd , a federal inmate also with the last name Floyd ( no relation ) died this week in an encounter with guards in New York City after being pepper-sprayed in his cell .
Similarly , watchdogs have complained for years about the odd status of the U.S . Marshals Service , a federal agency with roots in the frontier and Wild West that today is in charge of protecting courts and judges , securing federal prisoners and hunting fugitives . The national service is still led across the country by 94 local politically appointed marshals whose posts are handed out as favors , not because of their law enforcement acumen . ( The Boston Globe once famously surveilled for 10 days the U.S. marshal in Massachusetts , appointed after a stint on the security detail of the state ’ s governor , and found he worked an average of only four hours a day . )
Under the Trump administration , Cabinet officials have come under scrutiny for using the government ’ s law enforcement agents as a sort of Praetorian Guard : EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt resigned amid scandals that included his unprecedented 20-agent round-the-clock security detail , who picked up his dry cleaning and moisturizing lotion ; Education Secretary Betsy Devos is protected by a detail of U.S. marshals at a cost of roughly $ 500,000 a month , and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is under investigation after a whistleblower complained he was using his Diplomatic Security Service agents to pick up Chinese food or look after his dog . Even obscure Cabinet secretaries who could pass all-but unnoticed on any street in the country now warrant security : Want to be the special-agent-in-charge of guarding the Agriculture secretary ? The Executive Protective Operations Division of the USDA ’ s Office of Safety , Security and Protection is hiring right now !
Concerningly , under the Trump administration , many of these agencies have been rudderless—overseen by rotating series of acting officials . More than half of all federal civilian law enforcement right now is being led by temporary acting officials , everything from ICE and CBP to DEA . ( That calculation doesn ’ t even count the thousands of special agents in inspectors general offices that have recently seen an administrationwide purge of the government ’ s watchdogs . ) The Bureau of Prisons was being overseen by an acting director last summer when Jeffrey Epstein managed to commit suicide while supposedly under strict monitoring . The DEA , with its special temporary powers for the protests , is currently led by an acting administrator who has been on the job for just days .
Such leadership voids are not solely a recent problem of the Trump administration : Thanks to pressure from the National Rifle Association on Republican lawmakers about the agency ’ s firearms investigations , the ATF has had a Senate-confirmed director for a total of only two years since 2003 . Last month , the Trump administration withdrew its most recent nominee to be ATF director , Chuck Canterbury , a former police union leader who had been deemed by Republican senators as too liberal on guns . ( Yes , you read that right : The former head of the Fraternal Order of Police was considered too liberal for the GOP . )
The proliferation of federal officers across government—and the proliferation of watchdogs watching those government agencies—means that you might one day be woken up by a SWAT team-style raid by the Department of Education or the EPA . And the number keeps growing : Congress was surprised when the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction—known as SIGAR—began procuring its own ammunition , flashing lights and body armor for its special agents . Just like its laws , there are too many federal agents for the government to keep track of .
The Covid-19 pandemic has even spawned what will apparently be the nation ’ s newest federal investigator : The Senate confirmed on Tuesday a special inspector general to oversee the $ 500 billion pandemic recovery spending . He , presumably , will be recruiting his own agents and equipment soon .","Nearly all of these agencies are headquartered in and around the capital, making it easy for Attorney General William Barr to enlist them as part of his vast effort to “flood the zone” in D.C. this week with what amounts to a federal army of occupation, overseen from the FBI Washington area command post in Chinatown. Battalions of agents were mustered in the lobby of Customs and Border Protection’s D.C. headquarters—what in normal times is the path to a food court for federal workers. The Drug Enforcement Administration has been given special powers to enable it to surveil protesters. It is the heaviest show of force in the nation’s capital since the protests and riots of the Vietnam War.

As large as the public show of force on D.C.’s streets has turned out to be—Bloomberg reported Thursday that the force includes nearly 3,000 law enforcement—it still represents only a tiny sliver of the government’s armed agents and officers. The government counts up its law enforcement personnel only every eight years, and all told, at last count in 2016, the federal government employed over 132,000 civilian law enforcement officers—only about half of which come from the major “brand name” agencies like the FBI, ATF, Secret Service, DEA and CBP. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, which serves as the general academy for federal agencies who don’t have their own specialized training facilities, lists around 80 different agencies whose trainees pass through its doors in Georgia, from the IRS’ criminal investigators and the Transportation Security Administration's air marshals to the Offices of the Inspector General for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Railroad Retirement Board. Don’t forget the armed federal officers at the Environmental Protection Agency or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Office of Law Enforcement, whose 150 agents investigate conservation crime like the Tunas Convention Act of 1975 (16 USC § 971-971k) and the Northern Pacific Halibut Act of 1982 (16 USC § 773-773k).

(Only recently did the Library of Congress police merge with the Capitol Police across the street into one unit.) Run a bit farther and you might encounter the FBI Police or the U.S. Mint police. And that’s not even counting the multistate Metro Transit police and the local D.C. Metropolitan Police.

The gunman has been identified as Robert Lewis Dear . It 's still not clear what the shooter 's motive was , but it 's clear that he started his shooting spree at Planned Parenthood and stayed there .
It 's also clear that threats , vandalism , and violence against abortion providers and clinics have escalated since this summer , when anti-abortion activists released deceptively edited videos that accused Planned Parenthood of `` selling baby parts . ''
The FBI saw an increase in `` pro-life extremist '' attacks after the videos were released
Back in September , CBS reported that the FBI had noticed an uptick in attacks on reproductive health care facilities since the first video was released by the anti-abortion group Center for Medical Progress ( CMP ) . There were nine criminal or suspicious incidents ( including cyber attacks , threats , and arsons ) from July , when the videos first came out , through mid-September .
An FBI Intelligence Assessment at the time found these attacks were `` consistent with the actions of lone offenders using tactics of arsons and threats all of which are typical of the pro-life extremist movement . '' Moreover , the report said it was `` likely criminal or suspicious incidents will continue to be directed against reproductive health care providers , their staff and facilities . ''
Less than two weeks after CBS reported that , another abortion clinic was firebombed in California . It was the fourth arson at a Planned Parenthood location in as many months .
`` The toxic rhetoric directed at Planned Parenthood has dangerous consequences , '' said Sen. Dianne Feinstein in a press release at the time . `` It sends a signal that using violence to close clinics and intimidate healthcare professionals and women is 'OK . ' It is not . ''
Since 1977 , according to NAF , there have been eight murders , 17 attempted murders , 42 bombings , and 186 arsons against abortion clinics and providers .
Reproductive rights advocates have been sounding the alarm for months
Abortion providers have seen `` an unprecedented increase in hate speech and threats '' since the CMP videos came out , Vicki Saporta , president and CEO of the National Abortion Federation , said in a statement Friday . Incidents of harassment at Planned Parenthood facilities increased ninefold in July , when the videos came out , over June , according to a motion for preliminary injunction that NAF filed this month against CMP and its founder David Daleiden .
`` We have been quite worried that this increase in threats would lead to a violent attack like we saw today , '' Saporta said .
In an October feature at Broadly , Callie Beusman interviewed Saporta and representatives from other reproductive health groups . They all blamed the videos for an increase in violent rhetoric and action .
Sasha Bruce , senior vice president of campaigns and strategy at NARAL , told Beusman that while hateful and intimidating rhetoric against abortion providers is nothing new , the `` intensity and the level '' is notable of late . `` It is not common that you hear about three arsons in a row ; it is not common that you hear about this level of vandalism , '' Bruce said .
Notably , the Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood health center where the shooting happened is operated by Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains — one of the targets of CMP 's videos . One of the doctors featured in those videos was harassed by anti-abortion activists at her home , according to NAF 's motion against CMP :
And less than two weeks after Dr. Ginde was victimized by Defendants ’ `` web series , '' she was met by a group of 50 extremists at her home , holding signs stating `` Planned Parenthood sells baby parts , '' and leaving fliers around her neighborhood claiming in massive print that `` Savita Ginde Murders Children . ''
Pro-life groups have condemned the shooting , but pro-choice advocates say their rhetoric incites violence
Major pro-life groups have condemned the shooting , including National Right to Life Committee , Americans United for Life , Operation Rescue , and Christian Defense Coalition . David Daleiden of CMP , the architect of the anti-Planned Parenthood videos , also condemned the shootings .
To some pro-choice advocates , it 's ironic to hear these condemnations from Daleiden and from Operation Rescue in particular . Operation Rescue 's senior vice president , Cheryl Sullenger , was once jailed for conspiring to bomb an abortion clinic . The group has a history of extremist rhetoric against abortion providers ; for years the group protested Dr. George Tiller , who was shot and killed in 2009 , and called him `` Tiller the Killer . '' The man who murdered Tiller , Scott Roeder , was active on Operation Rescue message boards . And Operation Rescue president Troy Newman , who was recently detained and denied entry into Australia for his extremist writings , is on the board of Daleiden 's Center for Medical Progress .
In short , lots of ppl who violently attack clinics started out as protesters , escalated to vandalism , & then leveled up to guns , bombs , etc . — ClinicEscort ( @ ClinicEscort ) November 27 , 2015
Shootings at abortion clinics are rare , but attacks on clinics like vandalism and arson are common . Incidents of harassment that do n't rise to the level of criminal activity are so common as to be routine , according to volunteers who escort women 's health patients past anti-abortion clinic protesters . And , they argue , these minor incidents can escalate — after all , Scott Roeder vandalized an abortion clinic shortly before he killed George Tiller .
`` Although anti-abortion groups may condemn this type of violence when it happens , the way that they target and demonize providers contributes to a culture where some feel it is justifiable to murder doctors simply because they provide women with the abortion care they need , '' said Saporta of NAF in her Friday statement .
Vicki Cowart , president of Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains , cautioned on Friday that we still do n't know the motive for the shooting . But she also said that PPRM shares `` the concerns of many Americans that extremists are creating a poisonous environment that feeds domestic terrorism in this country . ''","A white male gunman killed three people, including one police officer, and injured nine others Friday at a Planned Parenthood in Colorado Springs.

Incidents of harassment at Planned Parenthood facilities increased ninefold in July, when the videos came out, over June, according to a motion for preliminary injunction that NAF filed this month against CMP and its founder David Daleiden.

""We have been quite worried that this increase in threats would lead to a violent attack like we saw today,"" Saporta said.

In an October feature at Broadly, Callie Beusman interviewed Saporta and representatives from other reproductive health groups. They all blamed the videos for an increase in violent rhetoric and action.

Sasha Bruce, senior vice president of campaigns and strategy at NARAL, told Beusman that while hateful and intimidating rhetoric against abortion providers is nothing new, the ""intensity and the level"" is notable of late. ""It is not common that you hear about three arsons in a row; it is not common that you hear about this level of vandalism,"" Bruce said.

Notably, the Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood health center where the shooting happened is operated by Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains — one of the targets of CMP's videos. One of the doctors featured in those videos was harassed by anti-abortion activists at her home, according to NAF's motion against CMP:

And less than two weeks after Dr. Ginde was victimized by Defendants’ ""web series,"" she was met by a group of 50 extremists at her home, holding signs stating ""Planned Parenthood sells baby parts,"" and leaving fliers around her neighborhood claiming in massive print that ""Savita Ginde Murders Children.""

Pro-life groups have condemned the shooting, but pro-choice advocates say their rhetoric incites violence

Major pro-life groups have condemned the shooting, including National Right to Life Committee, Americans United for Life, Operation Rescue, and Christian Defense Coalition. David Daleiden of CMP, the architect of the anti-Planned Parenthood videos, also condemned the shootings.

To some pro-choice advocates, it's ironic to hear these condemnations from Daleiden and from Operation Rescue in particular. Operation Rescue's senior vice president, Cheryl Sullenger, was once jailed for conspiring to bomb an abortion clinic. The group has a history of extremist rhetoric against abortion providers; for years the group protested Dr. George Tiller, who was shot and killed in 2009, and called him ""Tiller the Killer."" The man who murdered Tiller, Scott Roeder, was active on Operation Rescue message boards. And Operation Rescue president Troy Newman, who was recently detained and denied entry into Australia for his extremist writings, is on the board of Daleiden's Center for Medical Progress.

In short, lots of ppl who violently attack clinics started out as protesters, escalated to vandalism, & then leveled up to guns, bombs, etc. — ClinicEscort (@ClinicEscort) November 27, 2015

Shootings at abortion clinics are rare, but attacks on clinics like vandalism and arson are common. Incidents of harassment that don't rise to the level of criminal activity are so common as to be routine, according to volunteers who escort women's health patients past anti-abortion clinic protesters. And, they argue, these minor incidents can escalate — after all, Scott Roeder vandalized an abortion clinic shortly before he killed George Tiller.

""Although anti-abortion groups may condemn this type of violence when it happens, the way that they target and demonize providers contributes to a culture where some feel it is justifiable to murder doctors simply because they provide women with the abortion care they need,"" said Saporta of NAF in her Friday statement.

Vicki Cowart, president of Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains, cautioned on Friday that we still don't know the motive for the shooting. But she also said that PPRM shares ""the concerns of many Americans that extremists are creating a poisonous environment that feeds domestic terrorism in this country.""",www.vox.com,left,qNKnIxaG3NKWJvWW

For days , federal agents in unmarked cars have reportedly been snatching Portland protesters off the streets .

Ad Policy
Dated July 1 , the memo is titled “ Public Affairs Guidance : CBP Support to Protect Federal Facilities and Property ” and marked “ For Official Use Only. ” It describes a special task force created by the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) in response to President Trump ’ s Executive Order on Protecting American Monuments , Memorials , and Statues and Combating Recent Criminal Violence . That task force , the Protecting American Communities Task Force ( PACT ) , has been tasked not only to assess civil unrest but also to “ surge ” resources to protect against it .
The Portland arrest of Mark Pettibone , first reported by Oregon Public Broadcasting , followed several similar arrests involving officers from a Border Patrol Tactical Unit ( BORTAC ) —CBP ’ s equivalent of a SWAT team—as well as the US Marshals Special Operations Group . A CBP spokesman confirmed to ███ that CBP agents were responsible for the arrest , pointing to authorities under the Protecting American Communities Task Force .
“ Violent anarchists have organized events in Portland over the last several weeks with willful intent to damage and destroy federal property , as well as injure federal officers and agents , ” said the CBP spokesman . “ These criminal actions will not be tolerated. ” Secret Police Trump Unleashes His Secret Police in Portland Jeet Heer
The talking points memo identifies a series of potential questions , including many of those being asked in response to the Portland arrests .

USA TODAY

MESQUITE, Texas — As gunshots ring out around her, Vickie Kale shakes her head in disbelief.

“How can you point your gun at someone and shoot them?” asks the certified firearms instructor. “What can make someone so mad they would do that?”

Kale runs Gibson’s Outpost & Shooting Range, barely a mile from where police say Micah Xavier Johnson lived before he attacked Dallas police Thursday night, killing five officers. Gibson’s is the closest range to Johnson’s home, but no one here recognizes him or remembers him. If he practiced, and they say he must have, he practiced elsewhere.

Dallas police have not yet released details about the kind of rifle Johnson was firing, how many rounds he shot, or where he may have practiced before launching his murderous rampage. WFAA-TV on Saturday reported that authorities believe Johnson had planned a much larger attack, based on the ammunition he was carrying and his access to explosives.

Kale watches as one of her regular customers fires round after round downrange from a .45-caliber 1911 handgun, the heavy bullets shredding the paper target in the hot Texas sun. Another man soon arrives, setting up a rifle to fire at targets much farther away. Neither man wants to talk to a reporter, or at least give their names. They’re worried that speaking about guns to a reporter will bring trouble to their homes, or make them a target of a government about which they’re skeptical or outright afraid.

In Texas, the open carrying of rifles is legal, and many firearms owners say the media focuses too much on whether someone has a gun, and not enough on the people who use them improperly. After all, they say, millions of Americans own guns that will never be used against another person. Where's the individual accountability, they ask? Where are the family values that teach kids to respect cops and defer to authority, to do what they're told when ordered by an officer?

At the range, the gun owners who don’t want to be quoted by name say they see their firearms as tools, as things of beauty — things that Johnson abused when he opened fire at the police officers working the protest.

Kale says it for those unwilling to be quoted: “Our government has pushed this situation to the point where police officers aren’t respected.”

Johnson apparently learned to shoot in his six years in the U.S. Army Reserve, and he served one tour of duty in Afghanistan beginning in late 2013, according to the Army. He was a private first class with a specialty in carpentry and masonry but didn’t appear to have specialized training as a sniper.

Dallas police have not yet released a complete timeline of how they believe Johnson moved around the area during the shootings. He was killed Thursday night by police using a pound of C-4 explosive delivered by a remote-controlled robot. During a long standoff with police, Johnson told negotiators that he was upset over recent police-involved shootings of blacks and wanted to kill white people, especially white police officers.

Authorities who searched his home in Mesquite found a personal journal of combat tactics, as well as bomb-making materials, ballistic vests, rifles and ammunition. Mesquite is about a 20-minute drive east of downtown Dallas, and the drive takes visitors past multiple firearms stores tucked near nail salons and doughnut shops. Few of the gun dealers wanted to discuss what happened, but at least one store made it clear that President Obama wouldn’t be welcome inside its aisles selling noise-suppressors and cases of ammunition.

Gun-control advocates have used Johnson's attack to rally support in favor of stricter laws, including against open carrying of firearms, which is legal in Texas.

Back at the range near Johnson’s house, Kale said she and her friends always remark that their guns never clean the kitchen or take out the trash, but somehow get blamed for killing other people, even though they’ve never fired a shot in anger.

“It’s not the gun. It’s not the car. It’s the people driving, the person firing,” she said. “Why don’t we talk about that?”

`` I 'm devastated . It do n't seem like it 's real , '' Vincent Mitchell said shortly after his stepson-in-law , Willie Corey Godbolt , was arrested . `` Him and my stepdaughter , they 've been going back and forth for a couple of years with that domestic violence . ''
Godbolt , 35 , is accused of walking into Mitchell 's home in Bogue Chitto in southern Mississippi just before midnight Saturday and opening fire , killing Mitchell 's wife , his sister-in-law and one of their daughters .
Also slain was Deputy William Durr , a two-year sheriff 's department veteran and former police officer in nearby Brookhaven , where authorities said Godbolt fled and killed four more people at two other homes .
Godbolt stormed into Mitchell 's home that night and demanded his estranged wife give up their two children . She and the kids had been staying with them for about three weeks , Mitchell told The Associated Press .
`` He 'd come to get his kids . The deputy was called , '' and asked him to leave , and it seemed like Godbolt would comply at first , Mitchell said .
`` He acted like , motioned like , he was fixing to go . Then he reached in his back pocket and grabbed a gun , '' Mitchell said . `` He just started shooting everything . ''
Godbolt was arrested near the final crime scene , in a subdivision of ranch houses , and hospitalized in good condition -- treated for a gunshot wound -- but it 's unclear who shot him . At least seven hours passed between the first shooting and arrest . Godbolt said he did n't plan to be captured alive .
`` My intentions was to have God kill me . I ran out of bullets , '' he said . `` Suicide by cop was my intention . ''
Mississippi Bureau of Investigation spokesman Warren Strain said prosecutors plan to charge Godbolt with murder . It 's unclear what the motive for the shooting is at this time .
Authorities gave no details on his relationship to the victims , but a member of Godbolt 's church told the Associated Press that everyone but the deputy was related to Godbolt by blood or marriage .
`` Everybody that got killed was related to him , except the deputy , '' said Johnny Hall Sr. , a longtime member of the New Zion Union M.B . Church in Bogue Chitto , not far from the initial crime scene , where he said Godbolt also was a member .
Godbolt himself shed some light on what happened , in an interview he gave to The Clarion-Ledgeras he sat with his hands cuffed behind his back on the side of a road in Brookhaven , about 70 miles south of Jackson .
`` I was having a conversation with her stepdaddy and her mama and her , my wife , about me taking my children home , '' he said . `` Somebody called the officer , people that did n't even live at the house . That 's what they do . They intervene . ''
`` They cost him his life , '' he said , apparently referring to Durr . `` I 'm sorry . ''
`` My pain was n't designed for him . He was just there , '' Godbolt said . `` I ai n't fit to live , not after what I done . ''
Durr , 36 , was married and had an 11-year-old son , Lincoln County Sheriff Steve Rushing said .
Off duty , he was a ventriloquist who took his puppets to schools and churches . Two weeks ago , Durr entertained preschoolers at Brookhaven Academy , a Christian school in town . The message he shared was that — like fireflies — people can use their inner light to help those around them .

violence_in_america,Fox Online News,2,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/07/14/george-zimmerman-acquitted-murder-in-trayvon-martin-shooting-death/,Protesters Hit Streets After George Zimmerman Found 'Not Guilty',2013-07-14,,"Demonstrators from coast-to-coast boisterously -- yet for the most part peacefully -- rallied Sunday in protest of a long-awaited verdict that acquitted Floridian George Zimmerman in the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin .
However , sporadic reports of vandalism trickled out of West Coast cities like Oakland , including the halt of a passenger train , the burning of American and California flags , the lighting of small fires in city roadways , shattered storefront windows and the spray painting of a courthouse , as well as the damaging of a police squad car . Protesters massed there Saturday evening just after the verdict was rendered by a six-person , all-female jury around 10 p.m . ET .
`` I know this case has elicited strong passions . And in the wake of the verdict , I know those passions may be running even higher , '' President Obama said in a statement released Sunday . `` I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son . ''
In New York City , hundreds of protesters marched into Times Square on Sunday night , zigzagging through Manhattan 's streets to avoid police lines .
Sign-carrying marchers thronged the busy intersection , chanting `` Justice for ! Trayvon Martin ! '' as they made their way from Union Square .

Some tempered their anger , saying they did n't contest the jury 's decision based on the legal issues involved .
But `` while the verdict may be legal , a system that does n't take into account what happened is a broken legal system , '' said Jennifer Lue , 24 , an Asian-American resident of Harlem .
Rev . Jacqueline Lewis told the Middle Collegiate Church congregation in Manhattan Sunday morning , `` We 're going to raise our voices against the root causes of this kind of tragedy , '' while Baptist Pastor Jack Hakimian reportedly expressed disappointment and resignation at the Impact Miami Church in North Miami .
In South Florida , a wary populace awoke to relative calm Sunday , as fears of mass and violent protests proved unfounded in the face of a highly-visible police presence .
`` I haven ’ t seen any evidence of problems yet , and hopefully there won ’ t be any , '' Ed Shohat , a Miami-Dade ’ s Community Relations Board member , told The Miami Herald . `` We do not believe ( violence ) will happen . Frankly , Miami is a … more mature community than … 25 , 30 years ago when we had violent reactions to criminal court verdicts . ''
Meanwhile , Mark O'Mara , who defended Zimmerman at trial , suggested his client ’ s safety was at risk . `` There still is a fringe element that wants revenge , '' O'Mara said . `` They wo n't listen to a verdict of not guilty . ''
However , Martin supporters -- for the most part -- somberly grieved the verdict in a non-violent fashion .
Some detractors of the verdict spoke of a lingering and ineffable sadness , which they sought to privately assuage through the comfort of family and friends . Others convened in places of worship -- and in so-called First Amendment Zones erected by authorities -- especially for peaceful demonstration .
At a youth service in Sanford , Fla. , where the trial was held , teens wearing shirts displaying Martin 's picture wiped away tears during a sermon at the St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church .
In South Florida , Miami pastors planned to convene Sunday at 2 p.m. for a vigil at North Miami City Hall , while others awaited a second , scheduled service at 6 p.m. at the Torch of Friendship at Bayfront Park in Downtown Miami , according to CBS Local in Miami .
Overnight in Oakland , police said about 100 people protested , with some among the crowd breaking windows and starting fires in the streets . As the protest eventually fizzled , the office of police information added that it had no word of any arrests as of 2 a.m. local time .
However , some Oakland marchers reportedly vandalized a police squad car , and police were -- at one point - forced to form a line to block the protesters ' path .
The Oakland Tribune reported some downtown office windows had been shattered , and footage from a television helicopter portrayed people starting fires in the street and spray painting anti-police graffiti . Protesters , there , also reportedly burned an American , and California state flag and spray painted Alameda County 's Davidson courthouse .
Meanwhile , in San Francisco , raucous , yet peaceful protesters marched on the city ’ s Mission District neighborhood ; while about 200 in Los Angeles convened for a vigil in Leimart Park , the city ’ s historically black neighborhood . City News Service in Los Angeles reported at one point that a smaller group halted an Expo Line train , somewhere within the city , but police could not immediately confirm details of that account .
Los Angeles Police Department Lt. Andy Neiman said another group of 50 to 100 demonstrators marched around midnight .
`` There was a period where crowds were running among vehicles , but police dissuaded them , '' he reportedly said , although he added that he knew of no arrests .
More than 40 people gathered at City Hall in Sacramento , and the Sacramento Bee reported protesters riotously chanting : `` What do we want ? Justice . When do you we want it ? Now . For who ? Trayvon . '' Meanwhile , a banner unfurled behind the speakers read , `` No justice , no peace ! '' as the crowd cried out in unison .
In Florida late Saturday and into Sunday , media outlets reported mostly subdued sadness , and no violence or large gatherings .
“ I ’ m sad , ” was the only response Miami Gardens barber Steve Bass could muster to the Miami Herald , when asked for his opinion regarding the verdict . Bass had reportedly cut Trayvon Martin ’ s hair since the teen was a toddler .
Outside the Seminole County courthouse , where the trial took place , the Orlando Sentinel reported that a bewildered crowd of about 150 received the not-guilty verdict with chants of , `` No justice , no peace . ''
Some civic officials weighed in , with Miami-Dade Commissioner Jean Monestime telling The Herald via email , “ The jury ’ s verdict in the murder trial of George Zimmerman is extremely disappointing . As a father of two boys , this case was personal . We should honor the life of Trayvon Benjamin Martin with a peaceful , non-violent response to the verdict . ”
Just moments after the verdict was delivered , a Miami-Dade Police spokesman told The Herald that the department was warily watching developments across the southern Florida city .
“ We ’ re playing it by ear , just like everybody else , ” Detective Javier Baez said , adding Miami police had made “ minor ” changes to its Sunday routine , ordering officers who would normally report in plain clothes to don uniforms on Sunday .
“ Everyone knows to be here in town if we have to be available , ” Baez told The Herald .
A court public information officer said that members of the jury had no desire to speak to the media Saturday night . Identities of jury members are currently protected by a court anonymity order .
Around an hour after the verdict , Zimmerman 's father tweeted : `` Our whole family is relieved . Today ... I 'm proud to be an American . God Bless America ! Thank you for your prayers ! ''
Martin 's mother , Sybrina Fulton , tweeted `` Lord during my darkest hour I lean on you . You are all that I have . At the end of the day , GOD is still in control . Thank you all for your prayers and support . I will love you forever Trayvon ! ! ! In the name of Jesus ! ! ! ''
The verdict came a year and a half after civil rights protesters angrily demanded Zimmerman be prosecuted . That anger appeared to return Saturday night outside the courthouse , at least for some who had been following the case .
Rosie Barron , 50 , and Andrew Perkins , 55 , both black residents of Sanford , stood in the parking lot of the courthouse and wept .
`` I at least thought he was going to get something , something , '' Barron said .
Perkins was so upset he was shaking . `` He killed somebody and got away with murder , '' Perkins shouted , looking in the direction of the courthouse . `` He ai n't getting no probation or nothing . ''
Several Zimmerman supporters also were outside the courthouse , including a brother and sister quietly rejoicing that Zimmerman was acquitted . Both thought the jury made the right decision in finding Zimmerman not guilty -- they felt that Zimmerman killed Martin in self-defense .
Cindy Lenzen , 50 , of Casslebury , and her brother , 52-year-old Chris Bay , stood watching the protesters chant slogans such as , `` the whole system 's guilty . ''
Lenzen and Bay -- who are white -- called the entire case `` a tragedy , '' especially for Zimmerman .
The jury of six women informed Judge Debra Nelson shortly late Saturday that they had reached a verdict after deliberating for approximately 15 hours over two days . Zimmerman , 29 , blinked and barely smiled when the verdict was announced . After hearing the verdict , Judge Nelson told Zimmerman he was free to go .
`` We 're ecstatic with the results , '' defense attorney Mark O'Mara said after the verdict . `` George Zimmerman was never guilty of anything except protecting himself in self-defense . ''
Another member of his defense team , Don West , said : `` I 'm glad this jury kept this tragedy from becoming a travesty . ''
Martin 's killing in February 2012 unleashed debate across the U.S. over racial profiling , self-defense and equal justice . Protesters nationwide lashed out against police in the Orlando suburb of Sanford as it took 44 days for Zimmerman to be arrested . Many , including Martin 's parents , said Zimmerman had racially profiled the unarmed black teen . Zimmerman identifies as Hispanic .
The jurors considered nearly three weeks of often wildly conflicting testimony over who was the aggressor on the rainy night the 17-year-old was shot while walking through the gated townhouse community where he was staying and where Zimmerman lived .
Prosecutors called Zimmerman a liar and portrayed him was a `` wannabe cop '' vigilante who had grown frustrated by break-ins in his neighborhood committed primarily by young black men . Zimmerman assumed Martin was up to no good and took the law into his own hands , prosecutors said .
State Attorney Angela Corey said after the verdict that she believed second-degree murder was the appropriate charge because Zimmerman 's mindset `` fit the bill of second-degree murder . ''
`` We charged what we believed we could prove , '' Corey said .","Demonstrators from coast-to-coast boisterously -- yet for the most part peacefully -- rallied Sunday in protest of a long-awaited verdict that acquitted Floridian George Zimmerman in the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin.

violence_in_america,Breitbart News,2,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2014/08/20/The-Other-Victims-In-Ferguson,Looting Decimates Small Businesses in Ferguson,2014-08-20,Kerry Picket,"FERGUSON , Missouri–It ’ s not easy running a business with riots going on . In the ten days since Michael Brown was shot in Ferguson , Missouri , the small businesses that line the streets have suffered a major financial blow from the constant rioting , vandalism , and looting , owners said .
Looters and vandals have smashed windows of store fronts , spray painted graffiti , stolen property , and burned down businesses . Some stores re-opened with plywood plugging up their smashed windows . The words “ open for business ” are often spray painted on the plywood , but many customers are too afraid to even come .
One such sign for “ Yolo ! Botique ” says in spray-painted letters the store is “ OPEN ! ” and instructs would-be looters the facility is “ BLACK OWNED . ”
“ The first time [ my store was hit ] it was Saturday , early morning . I had shop lifters . You just don ’ t know what to expect . Is there going to be another one ? Is there going to be another break in ? ” Sonny Dayan , a small business who owns a shop in a small strip mall on West Florrissant Avenue in Fersguson , MO , told ███ on Tuesday . Dayan ’ s cell phone store , like others around it , is boarded up with hand-made signs telling the public they are still open .
“ Our patients are canceling left and right because they don ’ t want to come on our street , ” the owner of a medical facility told ███ . “ It ’ s affecting our bottom line for the past week . We ’ re going on the 8th day now . ”
The same business owner was concerned about releasing her businesses name for fear of retribution by protesters who may burn down the facility like she says they had already done to a friend ’ s place of business . Additionally , the shop owners are concerned the damages done may not be covered by their insurance .

So what else can we observe here as small business owners ? ”","FERGUSON, Missouri–It’s not easy running a business with riots going on. In the ten days since Michael Brown was shot in Ferguson, Missouri, the small businesses that line the streets have suffered a major financial blow from the constant rioting, vandalism, and looting, owners said.

Looters and vandals have smashed windows of store fronts, spray painted graffiti, stolen property, and burned down businesses. Some stores re-opened with plywood plugging up their smashed windows. The words “open for business” are often spray painted on the plywood, but many customers are too afraid to even come.

One such sign for “Yolo! Botique” says in spray-painted letters the store is “OPEN!” and instructs would-be looters the facility is “BLACK OWNED.”

“The first time [my store was hit] it was Saturday, early morning. I had shop lifters. You just don’t know what to expect. Is there going to be another one? Is there going to be another break in?” Sonny Dayan, a small business who owns a shop in a small strip mall on West Florrissant Avenue in Fersguson, MO, told Breitbart News on Tuesday. Dayan’s cell phone store, like others around it, is boarded up with hand-made signs telling the public they are still open.

“Our patients are canceling left and right because they don’t want to come on our street,” the owner of a medical facility told Breitbart News. “It’s affecting our bottom line for the past week. We’re going on the 8th day now.”

The same business owner was concerned about releasing her businesses name for fear of retribution by protesters who may burn down the facility like she says they had already done to a friend’s place of business. Additionally, the shop owners are concerned the damages done may not be covered by their insurance.

“I have the best insurance but I heard rumors they may try to play the social unrest card and say that I’m not covered and say that this is a civil unrest and therefore I’m not covered,” Dyan said.

The medical facility owner agreed saying, “Several of these businesses and we checked ours -there’s a cause in it that says there’s no coverage for anything pertaining to a riot act. So any of the damage is coming out of the [business owner].”

Early Marine accounts said the notification of the shooting came late Thursday when authorities found one dead victim.

Using a public address system, police announced a lockdown at the base and surrounded the building where the suspect was believed to be barricaded. They ordered everyone to stay in their homes, doors locked, they said.

Authorities from the base and Prince William County, Virginia, surrounded the shooter, who was in a barracks not far from where the first shooting occurred.

Quantico, a historic hothouse of Marine ideas and training

Visitors to the base will see a grand statue: the Iwo Jima Monument. It gives all who enter pause about the important role the base has played training generations of Marines in forging military doctrine and fighting America's wars.

The statue depicts the historic flag-raising on Mount Suribachi, on the Japanese island of Iwo Jima, during the famous World War II battle there.

The Quantico base, started during World War I, has been integral in training, education and forging military doctrine for America's battles.

Early on, amphibious warfare was, the corps said, ""conceived and perfected"" there. The Marines there came up with the idea ""of carrying troops from ship to shore by helicopter.""

Now, it's home to the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory, which conducts experiments in modern warfare.

""This is perhaps the only command whose mission touches the farthest reaches of the Corps; decisions made here impact Marines aboard ship, fighting in the Global War on Terrorism, on guard duty at embassies across the globe and reserve duty throughout the United States,"" the Marines said.

White nationalists claim they are important monuments – but are they just a way to rewrite an ugly history and revive the battles of the past ?
In St Paul ’ s memorial church in Charlottesville , Virginia , last Friday , just up the street from where white supremacists were gathering for a torchlight rally , Cornel West explained why African Americans saw the removal of Confederate monuments as so important .
On hearing that hundreds of white supremacists were gathered in a nearby park , the civil rights leader said , with a hint of weariness : “ These are chickens coming home to roost . We should have eliminated these statues a long time ago .
“ The idea that the American family has to embrace figures like [ Confederate general ] Robert E Lee , or Stonewall Jackson , who were fundamentally committed to enslaving black people in perpetuity … These people are not heroes . ”
But figures such as Lee and Jackson are heroes to some . Their admirers include Donald Trump . In a rowdy press conference on Tuesday , he compared them to celebrated figures in American history such as presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson . Their admirers also include the white nationalist movement , which is currently surging in the US . The footsoldiers of that movement terrorised Charlottesville last weekend . Trump downplayed their violent excesses , saying they were merely “ there to protest the taking down the statue of Robert E Lee ” .
Confederate statues removed across southern US states – in pictures Read more
The day after the torchlight parade , a rally featuring hundreds of mostly young men in various states of paramilitary attire shut the city down . Hours later , one of their number allegedly murdered a counter-protester with his car . The next day , a planned memorial to the young woman who had been killed was shut down after “ credible threats ” from white nationalists .
Their stated purpose in coming to the city for the “ unite the right ” rally was to contest the removal of a statue of Lee from a downtown park . In the blizzard of online agitprop that “ alt right ” groups circulated before the event , the claim was often made that in rallying around the statue they were protecting “ white heritage ” .
But how did monuments to the losing side in America ’ s civil war become such an intense focus for a national white-supremacist movement ? And what is the heritage they really represent ?
Charlottesville ’ s statue of Lee is one of about 1,500 such monuments to the Confederacy scattered throughout the US . Mostly , though not exclusively , those statues can be found in those southern states that broke from the union in 1861 over their desire to retain the system of slavery . In 1865 , after the loss of more than 600,000 lives and the destruction of entire cities such as Atlanta , the southern Confederacy was defeated , and slavery was abolished .
But like most of the other monuments to the confederacy ’ s “ lost cause ” , the statue in Charlottesville was not built in the immediate aftermath of that war . Rather , it was commissioned more than half a century later in 1917 , and erected in 1924 .
It was part of a wave of statue-building in the south that took place between the late 1890s and 1920 , according to research from the Southern Poverty Law Center . That wave crested in about 1911 .
There was another , later , flurry of statue-building in the 50s , and around this time the Confederate battle flag became a popular symbol . In that decade and the next , some southern states , such as Florida , changed their flags to more closely resemble the standard of southern defeat .
According to Joseph Lowndes , a political scientist at the University of Oregon and author of two books on the US ’ s racial politics and the south , the timing of these enthusiasms is not accidental . “ The statues go up in moments of racial reaction . ”
The earlier craze was the moment when Lowndes says , “ the Jim Crow order was really being built in the south ” . So-called Jim Crow laws formally segregated public schools , public transport and public spaces generally in former confederate states . Laws mandated that black people and white people use separate restaurants , toilets and drinking fountains .
According to Lowndes , the Jim Crow phenomenon was a reaction to the inroads made by the populist movement , which had fleetingly created political alliances of poor blacks and whites against the rich southern planter class .
Lowndes says that southern elites sought to “ take blacks out of the electorate and segregate public space ” in order to “ redivide the black and white core ” of the south ’ s working class and small farmers . The monuments were also elements of this divide-and-rule strategy . They were ultimately built for a white audience , as “ elements of a culture that directed whites towards beliefs that aligned them with the planters ” , says Lowndes . “ It was a political project . Any political project requires symbols , and an imaginary . ”
One of the core beliefs at the heart of the Jim Crow project – and which these laws sought to implant – was that the civil war had not been an ignominious defeat , but a noble struggle . Leonard Zeskind , activist and author of Blood and Politics , a history of white nationalism in the US , says the purpose of the hundreds of statues erected around the turn of the century was “ to rewrite who won the war ” , in order to justify Jim Crow .
Lowndes says it was in part an effort to “ whitewash the civil war , and the reasons it was fought ” . Eventually , Jim Crow was dealt a blow by the supreme court ’ s 1954 finding , in Brown v Board of Education , that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional . From this time , a black-led civil rights movement fought to extend the implications of this decision into the full desegregation of the south , and carried the fight into other areas such as voting rights .
But many whites in the south , and their state and local governments , fought tooth and nail to preserve segregation . They were , in effect , fighting the civil war all over again . In Virginia , a strategy of “ massive resistance ” devised by Senator Harry F Byrd Sr saw integrated schools defunded and schools closed , including in Charlottesville .
Around 7 in ten working-class whites believe the Confederate flag is a symbol of 'southern pride ' rather than 'racism '
It was during this white resistance to civil rights that confederate symbols and statues once again became popular , and were adopted both by ordinary people and whole states , as signifiers of the resilience of white supremacy . And it was during this time that there was another surge in the number of statues erected throughout the southern states .
Lowndes says : “ They are presented as being part of a continuous heritage , but the idea that these symbols have anything to do with anything but racial reaction is wrong . ”
Not everyone agrees with this assessment – in particular , contemporary white Americans . According to the American Values Survey by not-for-profit polling organisation PRRI , around seven in 10 working-class whites believe that the flag is a symbol of “ southern pride ” rather than “ racism ” . Sixty percent of whites of all classes feel this way , and so do 51 % of Americans as a whole – whereas 80 % of black Americans say it is a racist symbol , and it is African Americans fighting for racial justice who have been the foremost critics of confederate symbols since they were erected .
The great African American intellectual WEB DuBois wrote in 1931 of the grandiose inscriptions on recently erected monuments to the confederacy that : “ Of course , the plain truth of the matter would be an inscription something like this : ‘ Sacred to the memory of those who fought to Perpetuate Human Slavery. ’ ” Later , Zeskind says , “ the memorials started to get questioned in the 1960s in the fight against Jim Crow , and its been pretty much going ever since ” .
Since the 2015 massacre of nine African American churchgoers by Dylann Roof in Charleston , South Carolina , there has been a renewed focus on the persistence of confederate monuments and symbols in southern cities from racial justice advocates , including the Black Lives Matter movement . In the wake of the Charleston murders , South Carolina ’ s then governor , Nikki Haley , ordered the removal of the confederate flag from the grounds of the state house in Columbia . But racial justice advocates want to go further by removing all confederate relics from southern cities .
In Charlottesville on Friday , local Black Lives Matter chapter member Lisa Woolfork explained that for her and her fellow activists , “ these statues themselves are revisionist histories . They hide history . They tell a story from the 1920s of the ‘ lost cause ’ . It ’ s a way of making the slave-holding south feel like they won . ”
But while critics of the statues have been mobilising , white nationalists have been turning the statues into rallying points for resistance to multiculturalism , feminism and minority rights . For them the fight never really stopped , and now it goes on as they rally around these symbols of the confederacy .
Lowndes says that : “ These were largely regional sites as late as the 1990s , ” of interest mostly to southern heritage groups , but also to more extremist “ neoconfederate ” groups such as the Council of Conservative Citizens , and the League of the South . ( Neoconfederates generally desire the restoration of segregation as a matter of law , and some , such as the League of the South , even want the old confederacy to once again secede . ) “ But they have now become national sites for a racist rightwing movement . They allow people to feel embattled . You can rally people to a last defence . ”
Alexander Reid Ross is a lecturer at Portland State University , and author of Against the Fascist Creep , a broad historical survey of fascist movements to the present . He agrees that confederate monuments have at once given the “ alt-right ” a convenient set of symbols to organise around , and also swelled the constituency for radical neoconfederate groups .
“ Five or 10 years ago , ” Ross says , “ there wasn ’ t even a big regional constituency for neoconfederates . But the increase in college organising by the ‘ alt-right ’ and neo-Nazi groups has given them a new base . ”
The alleged murderer in Charlottesville last Saturday , James Fields Jr , was himself a member of a group , Vanguard America , that explicitly targets college-age men in its recruiting , and hundreds of young men were active participants in the weekend ’ s events . The spectacle in Charlottesville of the League of the South marching alongside neo-fascist and neo-Nazi organisations such as Vanguard America , the Traditionalist Workers Party and the National Socialist Movement demonstrates that to some extent , their objectives have fused .
Ross says that confederate monuments are attractive to these groups partly because they represent a period of unquestioned white supremacy . “ The civil war is seen as the last stand of a proper , gentlemanly white tradition. ” But they also have value in terms of movement strategy . He compares their selection of the Lee monument in Charlottesville to the “ patriot movement ” -inspired occupation of the Malheur national wildlife refuge in Oregon in 2016 . “ You place an insurrectionary point somewhere and have people rally around it . ”

George Hawley , a political scientist at the University of Alabama , and author of two books that examine dissident rightwing movements , says that national far-right movements have been attracted to the fight over Charlottesville ’ s monument partly from “ opportunism , and a desire for controversy ... But it also comes from their sincere feeling that attacks on confederate monuments are attacks on whiteness , per se . ”
He says that the discussion around confederate monuments is indicative of the growing estrangement between a resurgent radical right , and an embattled mainstream conservatism . In the past , he says , “ mainstream conservative media outlets were supportive of the maintenance of confederate symbols ” , and did so under catchphrases such as “ heritage , not hate ” . This changed after Roof ’ s rampage in Charleston : establishment and so-called “ movement ” conservatives “ stopped defending monuments ” .
On the other hand , over the same two years , passionate defenders of confederate symbols began “ echoing the progressive critique of the monuments ” , offering “ a more radical pushback against the idea that it wasn ’ t about race ” . From “ heritage not hate ” , then , some moved to the admission that their heritage was hate .
This was perfectly timed with the rise of the “ alt-right ” . Like that broader white nationalist movement , they sought to leave behind the “ dog-whistling ” , coded talk about race that Republicans had been honing since Nixon realigned the south ’ s politics with his “ southern strategy ” , and openly push white supremacy .
Southern politicians in communities polarised around disputes over monuments sometimes try to equivocate . During the debate over the statue of General Lee in Charlottesville , Mayor Mike Signer suggested that instead of removing such statues , they could be “ contextualised ” with plaques or installations explaining the civil war and the reasons it was fought .
Woolfork , the Black Lives Matter activist , disagrees . “ There is no better context for these statues than the hundreds of white nationalists coming to defend them. ” She says they need to go , because “ you can not tell beautiful lies about ugly stories ” .
There have been signs in the days since that the events in Charlottesville may have only accelerated the movement against confederate statues . In Durham , North Carolina , a group of protesters pulled down a monument dedicated in 1924 . On Tuesday night in Baltimore , hours after Trump ’ s incendiary press conference , the city removed four confederate memorials , including one of Robert E Lee and Stonewall Jackson . Other cities have committed to tearing statues down since the weekend .
For Cornel West , the sooner the better . As the white nationalist torchlight rally prepared to kick off not a mile away , he said that the heritage the statues speak for is not worth commemorating . “ The confederacy is part of a tradition that ’ s grounded in hatred , and is tied to one of the most vicious structures of domination in the modern world . ”
After the weekend ’ s events , it may be that more of the white Americans who consider these symbols a matter of “ pride ” come to see his point .

(Neoconfederates generally desire the restoration of segregation as a matter of law, and some, such as the League of the South, even want the old confederacy to once again secede.) “But they have now become national sites for a racist rightwing movement. They allow people to feel embattled. You can rally people to a last defence.”

Alexander Reid Ross is a lecturer at Portland State University, and author of Against the Fascist Creep, a broad historical survey of fascist movements to the present. He agrees that confederate monuments have at once given the “alt-right” a convenient set of symbols to organise around, and also swelled the constituency for radical neoconfederate groups.

“Five or 10 years ago,” Ross says, “there wasn’t even a big regional constituency for neoconfederates. But the increase in college organising by the ‘alt-right’ and neo-Nazi groups has given them a new base.”

The alleged murderer in Charlottesville last Saturday, James Fields Jr, was himself a member of a group, Vanguard America, that explicitly targets college-age men in its recruiting, and hundreds of young men were active participants in the weekend’s events. The spectacle in Charlottesville of the League of the South marching alongside neo-fascist and neo-Nazi organisations such as Vanguard America, the Traditionalist Workers Party and the National Socialist Movement demonstrates that to some extent, their objectives have fused.

Ross says that confederate monuments are attractive to these groups partly because they represent a period of unquestioned white supremacy. “The civil war is seen as the last stand of a proper, gentlemanly white tradition.” But they also have value in terms of movement strategy. He compares their selection of the Lee monument in Charlottesville to the “patriot movement”-inspired occupation of the Malheur national wildlife refuge in Oregon in 2016. “You place an insurrectionary point somewhere and have people rally around it.”

George Hawley, a political scientist at the University of Alabama, and author of two books that examine dissident rightwing movements, says that national far-right movements have been attracted to the fight over Charlottesville’s monument partly from “opportunism, and a desire for controversy ... But it also comes from their sincere feeling that attacks on confederate monuments are attacks on whiteness, per se.”

He says that the discussion around confederate monuments is indicative of the growing estrangement between a resurgent radical right, and an embattled mainstream conservatism. In the past, he says, “mainstream conservative media outlets were supportive of the maintenance of confederate symbols”, and did so under catchphrases such as “heritage, not hate”. This changed after Roof’s rampage in Charleston: establishment and so-called “movement” conservatives “stopped defending monuments”.

On the other hand, over the same two years, passionate defenders of confederate symbols began “echoing the progressive critique of the monuments”, offering “a more radical pushback against the idea that it wasn’t about race”. From “heritage not hate”, then, some moved to the admission that their heritage was hate.

This was perfectly timed with the rise of the “alt-right”. Like that broader white nationalist movement, they sought to leave behind the “dog-whistling”, coded talk about race that Republicans had been honing since Nixon realigned the south’s politics with his “southern strategy”, and openly push white supremacy.

Southern politicians in communities polarised around disputes over monuments sometimes try to equivocate. During the debate over the statue of General Lee in Charlottesville, Mayor Mike Signer suggested that instead of removing such statues, they could be “contextualised” with plaques or installations explaining the civil war and the reasons it was fought.

Woolfork, the Black Lives Matter activist, disagrees. “There is no better context for these statues than the hundreds of white nationalists coming to defend them.” She says they need to go, because “you cannot tell beautiful lies about ugly stories”.

There have been signs in the days since that the events in Charlottesville may have only accelerated the movement against confederate statues. In Durham, North Carolina, a group of protesters pulled down a monument dedicated in 1924. On Tuesday night in Baltimore, hours after Trump’s incendiary press conference, the city removed four confederate memorials, including one of Robert E Lee and Stonewall Jackson. Other cities have committed to tearing statues down since the weekend.

For Cornel West, the sooner the better. As the white nationalist torchlight rally prepared to kick off not a mile away, he said that the heritage the statues speak for is not worth commemorating. “The confederacy is part of a tradition that’s grounded in hatred, and is tied to one of the most vicious structures of domination in the modern world.”

After the weekend’s events, it may be that more of the white Americans who consider these symbols a matter of “pride” come to see his point.

The Justice Department has launched a civil rights investigation of the Ferguson shooting

Michael Brown, an African-American, was shot and killed by a white police officer

Protests continue with some erupting into violence on the streets of Ferguson

After years of causing angst for White House political aides by delving into issues of race, Attorney General Eric Holder is heading to Ferguson, Missouri, as President Barack Obama's top emissary.

The trip on Wednesday to the St. Louis suburb now in the spotlight represents the latest effort by the Obama administration to find a way to calm racial tensions following the police shooting of Michael Brown, 18.

Under Holder, the first black attorney general, the Justice Department has intensified its scrutiny of police departments, launching 20 investigations of police practices and alleged discriminatory enforcement patterns in the past five years.

That's more than twice the number of such probes in the previous five years.

That record is part of Holder's pitch to reassure the local community in Ferguson that the Justice Department will properly investigate the shooting of Brown, who was unarmed, by a white officer, Darren Wilson.

Ferguson has been at the center of daily standoffs between protesters and police since the August 9 shooting. Some of the protests have turned violent.

Holder's visit will focus on the Justice Department's civil rights investigation, which is examining whether Wilson acted properly in using deadly force. The federal probe is separate from a criminal one being conducted by local authorities.

""At a time when so much may seem uncertain, the people of Ferguson can have confidence that the Justice Department intends to learn — in a fair and thorough manner — exactly what happened,"" Holder wrote in an opinion piece for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch ahead of his trip.

""We understand the need for an independent investigation, and we hope that the independence and thoroughness of our investigation will bring some measure of calm to the tensions in Ferguson,"" he added.

Holder has been outspoken on issues related to disparity in the judicial system and has led efforts to reduce disparities in sentences that statistically have greater effect on racial minorities.

While those efforts have the backing of Obama, Holder's public views on the issue of race haven't always been welcome for the White House.

In his first major speech after taking office in 2009, Holder told a Black History Month gathering at the Justice Department: ""Though this nation has proudly thought of itself as an ethnic melting pot, in things racial we have always been and continue to be, in too many ways, essentially a nation of cowards.""

Obama criticized the ""nation of cowards"" characterization, saying ""if I had been advising my attorney general, we would have used different language.""

Privately, Holder believed he was right. But he stayed away from the issue for a while.

At the same time, he vowed to reinvigorate the Justice Department's civil rights division, which was the center of controversy over partisan meddling during the administration of President George W. Bush.

That unit enforces a 1994 law approved after the Rodney King beating by police in Los Angeles that makes it unlawful for police to engage in a pattern or practice that deprives people of their constitutional rights.

Of the 20 investigations the civil rights division has launched in the past five years, seven are ongoing, including those against police departments in Albuquerque, Miami, and Cleveland.

WLTX-TV, Columbia, S.C.

NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. — A grand jury has returned an indictment against a former South Carolina police officer in the shooting death of an unarmed black man who he had pulled over.

Solicitor Scarlett Wilson announced Monday that the Charleston County, S.C., grand jury had come back with the indictment against Michael Slager, 33, in the killing of Walter Scott, 50.

Slager was originally charged with murder April 7, and was subsequently fired from the police department.

Slager pulled over Scott's green Mercedes-Benz around 9:30 a.m. April 4. On the officer's dash cam, Slager said he pulled Scott over because of a non-functioning tail light. Several minutes after the stop, Scott ran from his car, and Slager ran after him, and the two eventually ended up in a private park a short distance away.

Initially, Slager said he used a Taser on the man, and the two struggled, and he was forced to pull out his gun and shoot him because he feared for his safety.

But a video recorded by Feidin Santana, a man walking after the event contradicted that version of events. The video, which shows the final seconds of the confrontation, shows Scott running away, Slager pulling out his service weapon, then firing eight shots at Scott, killing him. Scott had a warrant out for his arrest.

Wilson explained the charge implies a form of premeditation, but that does not mean a person had to consider their actions for a long time. ""There's no time limit or time requirement in proving malice of forethought,"" said Wilson.

In the moments after the shooting, the video shows Slager putting handcuffs on Scott as the man was on the ground. A second officer then responds to the scene. About two and a half minutes after the shooting, Slager can be seen putting his hand on Scott's neck, apparently checking his pulse.

Santana gave the video to the police and Scott's family, and within days, charges were filed against Slager.

At the time of Slager's arrest, Justin Bamberg, an attorney for Scott's family expressed relief that charges were filed, saying, ""Where would we be without that video?''

Mark Keel, the chief of the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, said they had concerns about Slager's story from the beginning, saying there were inconsistencies.

""The facts that were presented to us by SLED warranted our seeking the indictment from the grand jury, and we'll just move forward now in preparing our case,"" Wilson said.

Wilson said at this point, there is no probable cause to charge any other officers.

A trial date has not been set.

Scott's family is pursuing a civil suit in the matter as well.

The shooting occurred after months of national discussion about race and policing after instances of law enforcement confrontations with unarmed citizens in Ferguson, Mo., New York City and elsewhere.

( Joshua Roberts/Reuters )
Cities lose their charms when they ’ re engulfed in chaos , crime , and mobs — and run by virtue-signaling appeasers .
NRPLUS MEMBER ARTICLE I n Aesop ’ s Fables and Horace ’ s Satires a common classical allegory is variously retold about the country mouse and his sophisticated urban cousin .
The city-slicker mouse first visits his rustic cousin ’ s simple rural hole and is quickly bored and unimpressed by both the calm and the simple fare .
When the roles are soon reversed , the country cousin at first is delighted by big-city mouse ’ s sumptuous urban food scraps and the majestic halls where they may scuttle about . But as the crafty clawed house cat and sharp-toothed guard dogs threaten both , and the noise and bustle mount , the stressed-out country mouse scampers home — at last realizing that his unappreciated quiet and safe abode trump action and sophistication every time .
These Greek and Roman fables reflect the classical world ’ s paradox of not particularly enjoying life in the fetid , plague-ridden , and dangerous big cities of Athens , Rome , and Alexandria that nevertheless gave the world Socrates , Virgil , and magnificent libraries . As towns grew into metropolises , their sheen as heady places for art , literature , and cultural change began to fade . In response , the once commonplace farm and distant town were increasingly romanticized , especially in such genres as pastoralism and bucolic poetry . The escape to the country estate was the ideal of the Roman senator , the same way that the “ ranch ” sometimes becomes the getaway from the Washington swamp for American presidents .
Originally , city man was “ astute ” ( asteios/astu : town ) and country man a rustic agroikos or bumpkin ( argoikos/agros : farm ) . But it was not such a simple dichotomy , as even today “ urbane ” is not always an unqualified compliment , and “ rustic ” is sometimes a grudging commendation of authenticity .
The urbane city dweller ( urbanus/urbs ) was also often portrayed in Roman comedy and satire as a naïve and full-of-himself fop . In contrast , the rustic bumpkin ( rusticus/rus : countryside ) might have been grubby and smelly . But he is also usually commonsensical , grounded , and skeptical .
Globalization , we thought , confirmed the superiority and desirability of the urban coastal mice . From Miami to Boston , they looked across the sea to the EU for guidance , not to Appalachia . Likewise , the strip from San Diego to Seattle was a rich window further westward to Beijing , Shanghai , Tokyo , Seoul , and Taipei , not looking backward upon stagnant Bakersfield , Provo , or Missoula . Winners lived as urban gentry ; losers were the clingers and deplorables of the interior .
Yale , Harvard , Princeton , Stanford , Hollywood , Facebook , Google , Amazon , CBS , NPR , PBS , the New York Times , the Washington Post , and Wall Street are certainly not to be found in Kansas , South Dakota , or Arizona .
Things began to change a bit with the election of Donald Trump and his attack on Chinese mercantilism , the inequalities of globalization , open borders , and the deindustrialization of the American interior . Election-night Electoral College maps revealed high-density , blue corridors as bookends on a less settled but undeniably geographically vaster red interior . The interior , not the coasts , determined the Electoral College vote . Peter Strzok ’ s smelly Walmart deplorables and Barack Obama ’ s clingers for once seemed to have had the upper hand .
Then came the COVID-19 epidemic . Suddenly , green mass-transit rail , high-density , elevator-reliant town houses , and subways were petri dishes , in a way Wyoming , upstate New York , and the Sierra Nevada foothills were not . Translated , what was the upside of going to Greenwich , Conn. , poetry readings of the latest hipster poet or buying the prints of the future Andy Warhol on Manhattan ’ s Upper West Side if you were either infected or locked in your cramped apartment dependent entirely on a host of previously taken-for-granted Others who brought you water , food , and power , and took out your garbage and sewage — or sometimes didn ’ t ?
Michael Bloomberg ’ s slur of dumb farmers dropping seeds by rote into the ground to produce corn on autopilot suddenly seemed even dumber when boutique bread was not to be so easily had at the corner La Boulangerie .
The contagion and the lockdown led to economic catastrophe . If the cities might have fared better than the countryside in the abstract calculus of finance and stocks , the recession also gave us another , rawer glimpse of Armageddon to come . Urban services and necessities may break down , but at least in the countryside , the proverbial basics of existential survival — food , water , power , guns , and fuel — are not so tenuous .
In small towns , outlying suburbs , and farmhouses , you can grow food , have a well , pump out your own septic tank , take target practice at home , and have a gasoline tank or a generator in reserve . You can be worth $ 2 billion on the Magnificent Mile , but if your Gulfstream is locked down at the airport , your driver socially distanced at home , your elevator on the blink , and your food courier a day late , then you are poorer than a peasant in Nowhere , Okla . The poor in high-rises in Queens are far more vulnerable than those in rickety farmhouses in rural Ohio .

Cities lose their charms when they’re engulfed in chaos, crime, and mobs — and run by virtue-signaling appeasers.

NRPLUS MEMBER ARTICLE I n Aesop’s Fables and Horace’s Satires a common classical allegory is variously retold about the country mouse and his sophisticated urban cousin.

The city-slicker mouse first visits his rustic cousin’s simple rural hole and is quickly bored and unimpressed by both the calm and the simple fare.

When the roles are soon reversed, the country cousin at first is delighted by big-city mouse’s sumptuous urban food scraps and the majestic halls where they may scuttle about. But as the crafty clawed house cat and sharp-toothed guard dogs threaten both, and the noise and bustle mount, the stressed-out country mouse scampers home — at last realizing that his unappreciated quiet and safe abode trump action and sophistication every time.

These Greek and Roman fables reflect the classical world’s paradox of not particularly enjoying life in the fetid, plague-ridden, and dangerous big cities of Athens, Rome, and Alexandria that nevertheless gave the world Socrates, Virgil, and magnificent libraries. As towns grew into metropolises, their sheen as heady places for art, literature, and cultural change began to fade. In response, the once commonplace farm and distant town were increasingly romanticized, especially in such genres as pastoralism and bucolic poetry. The escape to the country estate was the ideal of the Roman senator, the same way that the “ranch” sometimes becomes the getaway from the Washington swamp for American presidents.

Originally, city man was “astute” (asteios/astu: town) and country man a rustic agroikos or bumpkin (argoikos/agros: farm). But it was not such a simple dichotomy, as even today “urbane” is not always an unqualified compliment, and “rustic” is sometimes a grudging commendation of authenticity.

The urbane city dweller (urbanus/urbs) was also often portrayed in Roman comedy and satire as a naïve and full-of-himself fop. In contrast, the rustic bumpkin (rusticus/rus: countryside) might have been grubby and smelly. But he is also usually commonsensical, grounded, and skeptical.

Globalization, we thought, confirmed the superiority and desirability of the urban coastal mice. From Miami to Boston, they looked across the sea to the EU for guidance, not to Appalachia. Likewise, the strip from San Diego to Seattle was a rich window further westward to Beijing, Shanghai, Tokyo, Seoul, and Taipei, not looking backward upon stagnant Bakersfield, Provo, or Missoula. Winners lived as urban gentry; losers were the clingers and deplorables of the interior.

Yale, Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, Hollywood, Facebook, Google, Amazon, CBS, NPR, PBS, the New York Times, the Washington Post, and Wall Street are certainly not to be found in Kansas, South Dakota, or Arizona.

Things began to change a bit with the election of Donald Trump and his attack on Chinese mercantilism, the inequalities of globalization, open borders, and the deindustrialization of the American interior. Election-night Electoral College maps revealed high-density, blue corridors as bookends on a less settled but undeniably geographically vaster red interior. The interior, not the coasts, determined the Electoral College vote. Peter Strzok’s smelly Walmart deplorables and Barack Obama’s clingers for once seemed to have had the upper hand.

Then came the COVID-19 epidemic. Suddenly, green mass-transit rail, high-density, elevator-reliant town houses, and subways were petri dishes, in a way Wyoming, upstate New York, and the Sierra Nevada foothills were not. Translated, what was the upside of going to Greenwich, Conn., poetry readings of the latest hipster poet or buying the prints of the future Andy Warhol on Manhattan’s Upper West Side if you were either infected or locked in your cramped apartment dependent entirely on a host of previously taken-for-granted Others who brought you water, food, and power, and took out your garbage and sewage — or sometimes didn’t?

Michael Bloomberg’s slur of dumb farmers dropping seeds by rote into the ground to produce corn on autopilot suddenly seemed even dumber when boutique bread was not to be so easily had at the corner La Boulangerie.

The contagion and the lockdown led to economic catastrophe. If the cities might have fared better than the countryside in the abstract calculus of finance and stocks, the recession also gave us another, rawer glimpse of Armageddon to come. Urban services and necessities may break down, but at least in the countryside, the proverbial basics of existential survival — food, water, power, guns, and fuel — are not so tenuous.

In small towns, outlying suburbs, and farmhouses, you can grow food, have a well, pump out your own septic tank, take target practice at home, and have a gasoline tank or a generator in reserve. You can be worth $2 billion on the Magnificent Mile, but if your Gulfstream is locked down at the airport, your driver socially distanced at home, your elevator on the blink, and your food courier a day late, then you are poorer than a peasant in Nowhere, Okla. The poor in high-rises in Queens are far more vulnerable than those in rickety farmhouses in rural Ohio.

After the Trump election, the virus, the lockdown, and the recession, then came the looting, street violence, and arson of the protests that spiraled out of control after the initial demonstrations over the horrific death of George Floyd while in police custody. America saw that in extremis blue-city mayors and police chiefs would virtue-signal away the public’s own safety, to veneer either their own bias, fright, or impotence.

“ This is something that ’ s obviously important to me — the communities in Baltimore that are having these problems now are no different than the communities in Chicago where I first started working when I moved there as a community organizer , ” Mr. Obama said in a radio interview that aired Wednesday on “ The Steve Harvey Morning Show. ” “ I ’ ve seen this movie too many times before . ”
An overnight curfew in Baltimore Tuesday appeared to have quelled some of the rioting and violence that took place Monday after the funeral of 25-year-old Freddie Gray , who died while in police custody earlier this month .

“ Which is why usually when there ’ s disturbances or natural disasters , I usually try to let law enforcement or emergency responders do their work , ” he said . “ Once things have cleared up , I think there ’ s going to be a time where I go back to Baltimore , a city obviously that ’ s close by and I ’ m familiar with . ”
He said that trying to fix underlying problems in such situations isn ’ t easy , but that policies he ’ s talked about could make a difference and also called for building on a task force report issued in the wake of the events last summer in Ferguson , Missouri .
“ We can ’ t just kind of on the one hand say the problem ’ s with police , but on the other hand the problem [ s ] are these kids engaging in violence without also taking into account some of our responsibility as a larger society for trying to take seriously the need to rebuild many of these communities , ” he said .
“ And a lot of the policies I ’ ve talked about in terms of early childhood education or job training , attracting businesses to these areas or building infrastructure so people have access to where the jobs are — those are all things that could make a difference , but we ’ ve got to build a political movement around that as well , ” he said . “ If all we ’ re doing is focusing on retraining police but not dealing with some of these underlying issues , then these problems [ are going to ] crop up again . ”
He mentioned working with former Attorney General Eric H.

Shoichet","Ferguson , Missouri ( CNN ) -- Hours after federal civil rights investigators and the FBI opened an inquiry into the death of a teenager shot by a police officer in Ferguson , Missouri , violence flared again in the St. Louis suburb .
Police Chief Thomas Jackson told CNN shots were fired Monday night in Ferguson , and police fired tear gas to disperse a crowd that had gathered in an area where looting occurred Sunday .
`` Officers were brought in to quell the hostilities , '' he said . `` Tear gas was deployed . ''
The Saturday-night shooting , which left 18-year-old Michael Brown dead , has fueled rising tensions in the town of 21,000 and sparked national debate .
One side says the African-American teenager was surrendering , his hands in the air to show he was unarmed , when the officer opened fire . Authorities counter that Brown had attacked the officer in his car and tried to take his gun .
After a vigil for the teen devolved into chaos Sunday when violence and looting broke out among some protesters , NAACP President Cornell William Brooks called Monday for people protesting Brown 's death to do so nonviolently .
`` We have seen young people giving in to violence and frustration and rage . It may be inexcusable . It is not unexpected , '' Brooks told reporters . `` But I say to my young brothers and sisters , note the young man whose rage is your heart , note that he was nonviolent . He never got into a fight . If you want to honor his memory , honor his memory by seeking justice nonviolently . ''
Witnesses to Brown 's shooting say he was unarmed and had his hands in the air when the police officer shot him .
Authorities tell a different story . St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar says the officer tried to get out of his vehicle just before the shooting , but Brown pushed him back into his car .
Brown `` physically assaulted '' the officer , Belmar said , and the teen tried to get the officer 's weapon .
Brown was shot about 35 feet from the vehicle , the chief said , declining to provide more details . The officer 's name has not been released by authorities .
`` The genesis of this was a physical confrontation , '' Belmar said , adding that his department has been called in to conduct an independent investigation .
The Ferguson Police Department said its cars are not equipped with dashboard cameras .
Shell casings collected at the scene were from the officer 's weapon , Belmar said .
Monday , U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said the shooting `` deserves a fulsome review '' by federal investigators .
`` At every step , we will work with the local investigators , who should be prepared to complete a thorough , fair investigation in their own right . I will continue to receive regular updates on this matter in the coming days , '' Holder said in a statement . `` Aggressively pursuing investigations such as this is critical for preserving trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve . ''
The lawyer representing Brown 's parents called Monday for a swift investigation .
`` We want this investigation to be done fairly , and we make a demand to the Justice Department to come in and help restore trust and confidence in the process of equal justice . ... This family is very distrustful . This community is very distrustful , '' attorney Benjamin Crump told reporters , calling for witnesses to come forward .
`` No violence , just justice , '' the teen 's mother , Lesley McSpadden , told reporters .

And for this to happen , for him to be killed in broad daylight ... they want answers just like everybody else in the community . ''","Ferguson, Missouri (CNN) -- Hours after federal civil rights investigators and the FBI opened an inquiry into the death of a teenager shot by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, violence flared again in the St. Louis suburb.

Police Chief Thomas Jackson told CNN shots were fired Monday night in Ferguson, and police fired tear gas to disperse a crowd that had gathered in an area where looting occurred Sunday.

""Officers were brought in to quell the hostilities,"" he said. ""Tear gas was deployed.""

The Saturday-night shooting, which left 18-year-old Michael Brown dead, has fueled rising tensions in the town of 21,000 and sparked national debate.

One side says the African-American teenager was surrendering, his hands in the air to show he was unarmed, when the officer opened fire. Authorities counter that Brown had attacked the officer in his car and tried to take his gun.

After a vigil for the teen devolved into chaos Sunday when violence and looting broke out among some protesters, NAACP President Cornell William Brooks called Monday for people protesting Brown's death to do so nonviolently.

""We have seen young people giving in to violence and frustration and rage. It may be inexcusable. It is not unexpected,"" Brooks told reporters. ""But I say to my young brothers and sisters, note the young man whose rage is your heart, note that he was nonviolent. He never got into a fight. If you want to honor his memory, honor his memory by seeking justice nonviolently.""

Witnesses to Brown's shooting say he was unarmed and had his hands in the air when the police officer shot him.

Authorities tell a different story. St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar says the officer tried to get out of his vehicle just before the shooting, but Brown pushed him back into his car.

Brown ""physically assaulted"" the officer, Belmar said, and the teen tried to get the officer's weapon.

Brown was shot about 35 feet from the vehicle, the chief said, declining to provide more details. The officer's name has not been released by authorities.

""The genesis of this was a physical confrontation,"" Belmar said, adding that his department has been called in to conduct an independent investigation.

The Ferguson Police Department said its cars are not equipped with dashboard cameras.

Shell casings collected at the scene were from the officer's weapon, Belmar said.

Monday, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said the shooting ""deserves a fulsome review"" by federal investigators.

""At every step, we will work with the local investigators, who should be prepared to complete a thorough, fair investigation in their own right. I will continue to receive regular updates on this matter in the coming days,"" Holder said in a statement. ""Aggressively pursuing investigations such as this is critical for preserving trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.""

Mother: 'No violence, just justice'

The lawyer representing Brown's parents called Monday for a swift investigation.

""We want this investigation to be done fairly, and we make a demand to the Justice Department to come in and help restore trust and confidence in the process of equal justice. ... This family is very distrustful. This community is very distrustful,"" attorney Benjamin Crump told reporters, calling for witnesses to come forward.

Brown's parents urged people to remain calm.

""No violence, just justice,"" the teen's mother, Lesley McSpadden, told reporters.

McSpadden said her son recently graduated from high school and was supposed to start college Monday.

""We can't even celebrate,"" she said. ""We've got to plan a funeral.""

Standing beside the teen's family, Brooks said the NAACP is committed to determining what happened.

""We are committed to this family, committed to seeking justice, committed to being a presence, day-in and day-out,"" he told reporters.

Mayor calls for calm

""Obviously, the events of last night are not indicative of who we are,"" Ferguson Mayor James Knowles said on CNN on Monday morning, adding that Sunday night's chaos was ""not constructive"" and was only ""bringing down the community.""

St. Louis County Police said 32 people were arrested and shots were fired at police.

Monday, St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch said charges had been filed against about 10 people in connection with burglaries of several businesses.

""What occurred last night, the mob action, we know certainly is not representative of what's going on and what the people in the neighborhood necessarily think,"" he said.

Flanked by several from the community Sunday, McSpadden was McSpadden was emotional as she shouted into a television reporter's microphone.

""You took my son away from me! You know how hard it was for me to get him to stay in school and graduate? You know how many black men graduate? Not many!"" she said. ""Because you bring them down to this type of level where they feel they don't got nothing to live for anyway! (They feel) they gonna try to take me out anyway!""

Others who gathered shouted at police.

""We will stay out here as long as you are!"" they screamed at officers.

Many of the officers appeared stoic, watching young men kneel before them and raise their hands up to symbolize surrender, but one officer can be heard on video yelling back, calling protesters ""animals.""

Some in Ferguson are demanding that the name of the officer who shot the teenager be released.

Monday afternoon, Jackson -- the police chief -- said he plans to release the name in the next 24 hours. Authorities want to make sure the officer is in a safe location, he said.

'Lost control'

""Last night, everything lost control,"" Knowles said Monday.

He was asked about the officer who called protesters ""animals.""

""The officers did their best. They're only human,"" Knowles responded, adding that not every police officer present was from the Ferguson department.

Sunday's gathering became more intense as some people broke windows at a store and began taking things from it. They threw rocks and bottles. Gunshots rang out.

Antonio French, an alderman in St. Louis, said a QuikTrip gas station was looted and an ATM dragged out.

""This QuikTrip is where things started (Saturday) with this case, based on various accounts,"" French said.

The slain teenager and a friend were ""accused of stealing gum from the store or some sort of cigarettes,"" the alderman said.

""People have a lot of anger and are frustrated,"" French said. ""They don't have recourse in the system, and it happens often in this country, and it has boiled over. I think people are angry and looking for a reason to let it out tonight.""

Knowles said he wants to let the independent investigation into Brown's death take its course. He plans to meet with Brown's parents soon and will meet with clergy in Ferguson and African-American leadership in the town.

Whatever the investigation's findings, ""we will deal with that,"" he said.

Multiple gunshots

An autopsy will determine how many times Brown was shot. The medical examiner for St. Louis County, Mary Case, said Monday afternoon the autopsy is complete, but she would not give details and said St. Louis County police will release the information.

Toxicology results on Brown's body are pending.

On the number of times Brown might have been shot, Belmar has said, ""It was more than just a couple.""

""We don't know what happened, and there are lots of conflicting stories,"" Knowles said. ""Unfortunately, there will have to be some time taken to understand what happened. Hopefully, we will get to an understanding, and justice will be served.""

The officer who shot Brown is on paid administrative leave during the investigation and will be available to talk to county homicide detectives.

He has been with the force for six years and will be required to undergo two psychological evaluations before returning to duty, Belmar said.

Crump, who also handled the case of Trayvon Martin in Florida, said Monday that Brown's family is ""devastated"" and doesn't believe that the teenager got into a physical confrontation with police.

Martin, 17, was killed in 2012 by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was acquitted last year of murder charges.

The high-profile case sparked a heated nationwide discussion of race as well as debate over Florida's ""stand your ground"" law.

Monday, Crump said Brown's shooting once again highlights ""the senseless death of a young boy of color at the hands of people who are supposed to protect and serve them.""

""Their son was doing all the right things,"" Crump said. ""Graduating from high school, never been in trouble. And for this to happen, for him to be killed in broad daylight ... they want answers just like everybody else in the community.""

Cruz posed with guns and knives in photos posted on Instagram and made a chilling online comment about a mass shooting carried out in New York this summer .
His hints of future violence are part of an emerging portrait of the 19-year-old Broward County man who carried out the nation 's most recent mass killing on Valentine 's Day with an AR-15-style rifle he legally purchased last year .

Cruz was adopted at a young age by Roger and Lynda Cruz . Roger died years ago . Lynda died last fall , following an illness . He was taken in by the parents of a schoolmate , according to that family 's attorney .
His mother 's death capped troubled high school years that ended with his expulsion from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School .
A former classmate , who grew up with Cruz and attended school with him since the sixth grade , said Cruz would sometimes introduce himself as a `` school shooter . ''

He recalled Cruz stealing peoples ' mail , throwing rocks at cars and tormenting animals . He described one incident in which he said Cruz `` cornered a squirrel and was trying to throw rocks at it and kill it . ''
He said police were called to the house `` almost every other week . ''
Documents obtained by CNN show that law enforcement officers responded to Cruz 's house on 39 occasions over a seven-year period . No police reports were immediately available for those calls so it was not possible to determine whether Cruz was involved .

violence_in_america,Fox Online News,2,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/08/17/police-try-to-disperse-protesters-defying-ferguson-curfew/,"Seven arrested, 1 shot as police use tear gas on protesters defying Ferguson curfew",2014-08-17,,"Police fired smoke and tear gas canisters early Sunday in an effort to disperse several dozen protesters who defied a curfew in a St. Louis suburb where a black teenager was fatally shot by a white police officer last week .
The Missouri Highway Patrol said that seven people were arrested and one man had been shot at the site of the protest in Ferguson , Mo . Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt . Ron Johnson said that the shooting victim was in critical condition and had been rushed to a hospital by protesters .
Johnson said the use of tear gas was precipitated by concerns about people who 'd broken into a barbecue restaurant and taken position on the roof overlooking approaching police . Another concern involved a man flashing a handgun who appeared in the middle of the street as armored vehicles approached . Johnson says someone fired at a patrol car , but no officers were injured .
`` I was disappointed in the actions of tonight , '' Johnson said .
The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that St. Louis Alderman Antonio French , who has taken part in demonstrations all week , told reporters that the police 's tactics `` were a lot better '' than they could have been . French also said that he had attempted to convince people to honor the curfew , but some `` did n't want to be told to leave . ''
French later tweeted , `` I can tell you firsthand that some of the people that remained tonight were armed . Were ready for a fight . And wanted to injure police . ''
Hundreds of other protesters had left peacefully before the midnight-to-5 a.m. curfew took effect , but remaining protesters -- chanting `` No justice ! No curfew ! '' -- refused to leave the area .
As five armored tactical vehicles approached the crowd , officers spoke through a loudspeaker : `` You are in violation of a state-imposed curfew . You must disperse immediately . Failure to comply may result in arrest . ''
Highway Patrol Spokesman Lt. John Hotz initially said police only used smoke , but later told The Associated Press that they also fired tear gas canisters . He said of police efforts : `` Obviously , we 're trying to give them every opportunity to comply with the curfew . ''
As officers put on gas masks , a chant from the distant crowd emerged : `` We have the right to assemble peacefully . '' A moment later , police began firing canisters into the crowd . Protesters said their faces and eyes had been burned . Others screamed in pain .
Jayson Ross , who was leading the protesters toward police , said : `` They got guns . We got guns . We are ready . ''
The curfew had been announced by Missouri Gov . Jay Nixon Saturday afternoon in an effort to prevent the violence and looting that had marred earlier protests over the August 9 death of 18-year-old Michael Brown . The governor also declared a state of emergency .
Early Sunday , Johnson said that authorities were not aware of any looting that had occurred during the night .
Stormy weather and the urgings of protest leaders made the decision to go home before midnight easier for some . As midnight approached late Saturday , New Black Panther Party leader Malik Shabazz roamed the street with a bullhorn , encouraging people to leave for their own safety .
`` C'mon you all , let 's roll out , '' Shabazz said through his bullhorn . `` Let 's roll out of here , get some rest and come back tomorrow . ''
Nixon said Sunday morning on ABC 's `` This Week '' that he was not aware the police were going to release the surveillance video .
`` It 's appeared to cast aspersions on a young man that was gunned down in the street . It made emotions raw , '' he said .
In announcing the curfew , Nixon said that though many protesters were making themselves heard peacefully , the state would not allow looters to endanger the community .
`` I am committed to making sure the forces of peace and justice prevail , '' Nixon said during a Saturday press conference at a church that was interrupted repeatedly by people objecting to the curfew and demanding that the officer who shot Brown be charged with murder .
`` We must first have and maintain peace . This is a test . The eyes of the world are watching , '' Nixon said . `` We can not allow the ill will of the few to undermine the good will of the many . ''
Nixon 's curfew announcement came after tensions again flared in Ferguson late Friday night . Earlier that day , local police identified the officer who shot Brown as Darren Wilson and released documents and video footage alleging that Brown had robbed a convenience store just before he was shot . Police said Wilson was unaware Brown was a suspect when he encountered him walking in the street with a friend .
Law enforcement officials tell Fox News that the footage of Brown in the convenience store was released by local authorities over the Justice Department 's objections . One official told Fox News that federal authorities had their own copy of the tape and did not intend to make it public .
In a statement Sunday , Justice Department spokesman Brian Fallon said Attorney General Eric Holder has requested an additional autopsy of Brown to be performed by a federal medical examiner .
`` This independent examination will take place as soon as possible , '' the statement said . `` Even after it is complete , Justice Department officials still plan to take the state-performed autopsy into account in the course of their investigation . ''
Johnson , who is in charge of security in Ferguson , said 40 FBI agents were going door-to-door in the neighborhood starting Saturday , talking to people who might have seen or have information about the shooting .
Johnson assured those at the news conference that police would not enforce the curfew with armored trucks and tear gas but would communicate with protesters and give them ample opportunity to leave . Nixon and Johnson were flanked by numerous local elected officials , including U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay Jr. , who urged Johnson to be flexible with the midnight curfew .
`` Why is the focus on security and not getting justice ? Why is there not an arrest ? '' one women yelled .
Brown 's death had already ignited several days of clashes with furious protesters . Tensions eased Thursday after Nixon turned oversight of the protests over to the Missouri Highway Patrol . Gone were the police in riot gear and armored vehicles , replaced by the new patrol commander who personally walked through the streets with demonstrators . But Friday night marked a resurgence of unrest .
On Saturday , some residents said it appeared the violent acts were being committed by people who came from other suburbs or states .
`` Who would burn down their own backyard ? '' asked Rebecca McCloud , a local who works with the Sunshine Baptist Church in St. Louis . `` These people are n't from here . They came to burn down our city and leave . ''
Local officers faced strong criticism earlier in the week for their use of tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters . Johnson said one tear gas canister was deployed Friday night after the group of rioters became unruly and several officers got trapped and injured .
Wilson , the officer who shot Brown , is a six-year police veteran who had no previous complaints against him , the local police chief has said .
The Ferguson Police Department has refused to say anything about Wilson 's whereabouts , and Associated Press reporters were unable to contact him at any addresses or phone numbers listed under that name in the St. Louis area .
Wilson has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting . St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch said it could be weeks before the investigation wraps up .","Police fired smoke and tear gas canisters early Sunday in an effort to disperse several dozen protesters who defied a curfew in a St. Louis suburb where a black teenager was fatally shot by a white police officer last week.

""C'mon you all, let's roll out,"" Shabazz said through his bullhorn. ""Let's roll out of here, get some rest and come back tomorrow.""

Nixon said Sunday morning on ABC's ""This Week"" that he was not aware the police were going to release the surveillance video.

""It's appeared to cast aspersions on a young man that was gunned down in the street. It made emotions raw,"" he said.

In announcing the curfew, Nixon said that though many protesters were making themselves heard peacefully, the state would not allow looters to endanger the community.

""I am committed to making sure the forces of peace and justice prevail,"" Nixon said during a Saturday press conference at a church that was interrupted repeatedly by people objecting to the curfew and demanding that the officer who shot Brown be charged with murder.

""We must first have and maintain peace. This is a test. The eyes of the world are watching,"" Nixon said. ""We cannot allow the ill will of the few to undermine the good will of the many.""

Nixon's curfew announcement came after tensions again flared in Ferguson late Friday night. Earlier that day, local police identified the officer who shot Brown as Darren Wilson and released documents and video footage alleging that Brown had robbed a convenience store just before he was shot. Police said Wilson was unaware Brown was a suspect when he encountered him walking in the street with a friend.

Law enforcement officials tell Fox News that the footage of Brown in the convenience store was released by local authorities over the Justice Department's objections. One official told Fox News that federal authorities had their own copy of the tape and did not intend to make it public.

In a statement Sunday, Justice Department spokesman Brian Fallon said Attorney General Eric Holder has requested an additional autopsy of Brown to be performed by a federal medical examiner.

""This independent examination will take place as soon as possible,"" the statement said. ""Even after it is complete, Justice Department officials still plan to take the state-performed autopsy into account in the course of their investigation.""

Johnson, who is in charge of security in Ferguson, said 40 FBI agents were going door-to-door in the neighborhood starting Saturday, talking to people who might have seen or have information about the shooting.

Johnson assured those at the news conference that police would not enforce the curfew with armored trucks and tear gas but would communicate with protesters and give them ample opportunity to leave. Nixon and Johnson were flanked by numerous local elected officials, including U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay Jr., who urged Johnson to be flexible with the midnight curfew.

But they were interrupted repeatedly.

""Why is the focus on security and not getting justice? Why is there not an arrest?"" one women yelled.

Brown's death had already ignited several days of clashes with furious protesters. Tensions eased Thursday after Nixon turned oversight of the protests over to the Missouri Highway Patrol. Gone were the police in riot gear and armored vehicles, replaced by the new patrol commander who personally walked through the streets with demonstrators. But Friday night marked a resurgence of unrest.

On Saturday, some residents said it appeared the violent acts were being committed by people who came from other suburbs or states.

""Who would burn down their own backyard?"" asked Rebecca McCloud, a local who works with the Sunshine Baptist Church in St. Louis. ""These people aren't from here. They came to burn down our city and leave.""

Local officers faced strong criticism earlier in the week for their use of tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters. Johnson said one tear gas canister was deployed Friday night after the group of rioters became unruly and several officers got trapped and injured.

Wilson, the officer who shot Brown, is a six-year police veteran who had no previous complaints against him, the local police chief has said.

The Ferguson Police Department has refused to say anything about Wilson's whereabouts, and Associated Press reporters were unable to contact him at any addresses or phone numbers listed under that name in the St. Louis area.

Wilson has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting. St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch said it could be weeks before the investigation wraps up.

FERGUSON, Mo. — Armored vehicles, riot gear, tear gas and looting returned to this small Midwest city early Saturday as a brief period of peaceful demonstrations gave way to a violent atmosphere of anarchy.

Ariel Castro , 53 , was found hanging in his cell around 9:20 p.m. Tuesday at the Correctional Reception Center in Orient , located south of Columbus in central Ohio , JoEllen Smith , Department of Rehabilitation and Correction spokeswoman , said early Wednesday .
Prison medical staff performed CPR before Castro was transported to a hospital , where he was pronounced dead around 10:50 p.m .
Castro was in protective custody because of the notoriety of his case , meaning he was checked every 30 minutes , but was not on suicide watch , Smith said . She said suicide watch entails constant observation .
The three women disappeared separately between 2002 and 2004 , when they were 14 , 16 and 20 years old . They escaped from Castro 's Cleveland home May 6 , when Amanda Berry , one of the women , broke part of a door and yelled to neighbors for help .
`` Help me , '' she said in a 911 call . `` I 've been kidnapped , and I 've been missing for 10 years and I 'm , I 'm here , I 'm free now . ''
The two other women were so scared of Castro that they held back initially even as police officers began to swarm the house . But quickly they realized they were free .
`` You saved us ! You saved us ! '' another of the captives , Michelle Knight , told an officer as she leaped into his arms .
Castro was arrested that evening . He had also fathered a child with Berry while she was in captivity ; that girl was 6 years old when freed . A judge rejected Castro 's request to have visiting rights with his daughter .
Elation over the women 's rescue soon turned to shock as details emerged about conditions of their captivity . Investigators say they were bound with chains , repeatedly raped and deprived of food and bathroom facilities . Knight told investigators she was beaten and starved several times to force her to miscarry .
Messages left for the women 's lawyers were not immediately returned early Wednesday .
Castro was sentenced Aug. 1 to life in prison plus 1,000 years on his guilty plea to 937 counts including kidnapping and rape .
In a rambling statement , he told the judge he was not a monster but a man suffering from a pornography addiction .
`` I 'm not a monster . I 'm sick , '' Castro said at his sentencing .
Knight was the only one of the three who appeared in court at his sentencing .
`` You took 11 years of my life away , and I have got it back , '' she said in the hushed courtroom . `` I spent 11 years in hell . Now your hell is just beginning . ''
Castro was watched closely in the Cuyahoga County Jail in the several weeks after his arrest and before his guilty plea , with logs noting his activity every 10 minutes . He was taken off county jail suicide watch in early June after authorities determined he was not a suicide risk .
Castro 's attorneys tried unsuccessfully to have a psychological examination of Castro done at the Cuyahoga County Jail , where Castro was housed before he was turned over to state authorities following his guilty plea and conviction , his attorney , Jaye Schlachet , told The Associated Press early Wednesday . Schlachet said he could not immediately comment further .
In an interview last month after Castro 's conviction , Schlachet and attorney Craig Weintraub said their client clearly fit the profile of sociopathic disorder and that they hoped researchers would study him for clues that could be used to stop other predators .
This is the second high-profile suicide in an Ohio prison in a month .
On Aug. 4 , death row inmate Billy Slagle was found hanged in his cell just days before his scheduled execution . He was condemned to death for fatally stabbing a neighbor .

""Help me,"" she said in a 911 call. ""I've been kidnapped, and I've been missing for 10 years and I'm, I'm here, I'm free now.""

The two other women were so scared of Castro that they held back initially even as police officers began to swarm the house. But quickly they realized they were free.

""You saved us! You saved us!"" another of the captives, Michelle Knight, told an officer as she leaped into his arms.

Castro was arrested that evening. He had also fathered a child with Berry while she was in captivity; that girl was 6 years old when freed. A judge rejected Castro's request to have visiting rights with his daughter.

Elation over the women's rescue soon turned to shock as details emerged about conditions of their captivity. Investigators say they were bound with chains, repeatedly raped and deprived of food and bathroom facilities. Knight told investigators she was beaten and starved several times to force her to miscarry.

Messages left for the women's lawyers were not immediately returned early Wednesday.

Castro was sentenced Aug. 1 to life in prison plus 1,000 years on his guilty plea to 937 counts including kidnapping and rape.

In a rambling statement, he told the judge he was not a monster but a man suffering from a pornography addiction.

""I'm not a monster. I'm sick,"" Castro said at his sentencing.

Knight was the only one of the three who appeared in court at his sentencing.

""You took 11 years of my life away, and I have got it back,"" she said in the hushed courtroom. ""I spent 11 years in hell. Now your hell is just beginning.""

Castro was watched closely in the Cuyahoga County Jail in the several weeks after his arrest and before his guilty plea, with logs noting his activity every 10 minutes. He was taken off county jail suicide watch in early June after authorities determined he was not a suicide risk.

Castro's attorneys tried unsuccessfully to have a psychological examination of Castro done at the Cuyahoga County Jail, where Castro was housed before he was turned over to state authorities following his guilty plea and conviction, his attorney, Jaye Schlachet, told The Associated Press early Wednesday. Schlachet said he could not immediately comment further.

In an interview last month after Castro's conviction, Schlachet and attorney Craig Weintraub said their client clearly fit the profile of sociopathic disorder and that they hoped researchers would study him for clues that could be used to stop other predators.

This is the second high-profile suicide in an Ohio prison in a month.

On Aug. 4, death row inmate Billy Slagle was found hanged in his cell just days before his scheduled execution. He was condemned to death for fatally stabbing a neighbor.

'I don't think we get another chance to fix this'

Mourners gather at a memorial for Floyd outside a Minneapolis convenience store. Floyd was arrested after allegedly trying to use a counterfeit bill.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Wednesday visited the site of the fatal encounter for the first time.

Walz said he's been wanting to visit the scene. But ""I very much worry about white politicians appropriating black pain. And that's certainly not it. I have to personally and viscerally feel this,"" he said.

Conflict, confrontations and counterprotesters

Since May 26, the day after Floyd's death, at least 9,839 people have been arrested nationwide during protests, according to CNN's tally from agencies across the country.

While Tuesday night's protests were much more peaceful than the previous night, there were some skirmishes.

Milwaukee police fired tear gas after agitators threw rocks and glass at officers.

In Los Angeles, hundreds of protesters were arrested, LAPD spokesman Tony Im said.

In New York City, at least 40 protesters were arrested.

Some residents have filed formal complaints against officers' conduct during protests. The Seattle Office of Police Accountability received about 14,000 complaints about the conduct of Seattle police during demonstrations over the weekend, spokeswoman Anne Bettesworth said Tuesday.

Pockets of counterprotesters have also emerged.

In Boise, Idaho, police formed a line between the hundreds people who showed up for a vigil and some counterprotesters holding American flags and Blue Lives Matter flags, CNN affiliate KBOI reported.

Final county autopsy cites cardiopulmonary arrest

George Floyd's death was due cardiopulmonary arrest -- or the stopping of his heart -- according to the final autopsy results released Wednesday by the medical Hennepin County Medical Examiner.

The final report from the medical examiner says Floyd had a number of bruises and cuts on his head, face, mouth, shoulders, arms and legs. But it finds no evidence that any of those injuries directly would have killed him.

Investigators edged closer Thursday to the conclusion that Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife , Tashfeen Malik , were radicalized by Islamist extremists either in the U.S. or during trips to the Middle East , including Saudi Arabia .
Working to determine whether terrorism was the motive in the attack at a government-organized holiday party , officials scrambled to re-create the travels , contacts and lifestyle of Farook , a 28-year-old U.S. citizen of Pakistani descent , and his 27-year-old Pakistani wife .
Intelligence sources said there is still no explicit evidence linking the two to known terrorists on U.S. or foreign watch lists and that the couple was not on the FBI ’ s radar before Wednesday ’ s deadly shooting rampage . But their cache of thousands of rounds of ammunition and explosives found in a home that the couple rented raises major concerns about a wider plot , or a plan to act on their own to hit other targets .
Authorities have tracked down at least four people from the Los Angeles area who were previously under investigation by U.S. counterterrorism officials and were found to have had communication with Farook in the past , said a law enforcement source involved in the investigation .
But details about the individuals were murky . The law enforcement source said the last contact any of the four had with Farook was in June , and asserted that nothing fruitful came from the interviews about Wednesday ’ s attack .
SEE ALSO : Rand Paul : Those who dissed prayer after California attack are ‘ snide , snotty , and arrogant ’
With that as a backdrop , officials were working Thursday night to determine what motivated Farook and Malik to storm a conference room inside the Inland Regional Center during a holiday party and spray the room with bullets . Fourteen people were killed and another 21 were injured in either the shooting or a police pursuit and gunbattle that occurred hours later .
The San Bernardino County sheriff-coroner ’ s office continued to work at the scene of the massacre documenting evidence and removing several of the bodies that remained . It was not until Thursday afternoon that officials had contacted the next of kin for all 14 of the victims and that their names were publicly released .
Farook and Malik died in the firefight as they tried to evade police in a rented SUV , firing 76 rounds at officers who unleashed 380 rounds of their own and riddled the vehicle with bullet holes . More than 1,500 rounds of unspent ammunition were found in the vehicle , according to police .
One official , who spoke anonymously with The ███ , cautioned against jumping to conclusions . The official said the investigation is still young and asserted that “ radicalization can happen in a number of different inflection points and in a number of different ways . It ’ s not a one-size-fits-all sort of thing . ”
But fresh details continued to emerge about the background of the two — supporting the notion that the attack was planned and not a spur-of-the-moment response to a party snub or quarrel .
The couple had a 6-month-old daughter , who was left in a relative ’ s care before they stormed the Inland Regional Center bedecked in tactical-style clothes and spraying 75 rounds into the conference room .
Three pipe bombs configured as one large explosive device were recovered from the center . Police also found bomb-making materials , 12 pipe bombs and more than 4,500 rounds of ammunition inside the couple ’ s home .
“ This is not your average investigation , ” said David Bowdich , assistant director in charge of the FBI ’ s Los Angeles field office , mentioning the multiple crime scenes , victims and recovered evidence . “ It will take time . ”
Officials involved in the investigation said the couple appeared to have gone to great lengths to conceal themselves and make difficult investigation of their plans — further suggesting premeditation .
A cellphone recovered from Malik ’ s body was newly purchased and had been used only recently . Two other cellphones that were recovered had been smashed with a hammer and were expected to be sent to the FBI ’ s forensic lab in Washington for examination .
Authorities also noted that a hard drive and motherboard were missing from a computer found at the Redlands , California , home that the couple rented .
Farook worked as a health inspector for the San Bernardino County Health Department , the agency holding the holiday party . He had been in attendance at the event but was reported to have left and returned about 30 minutes later with his wife .
Accounts have emerged that Farook was engaged in a dispute with someone at the party before he left , but police at a Thursday press conference said they were still investigating the information and had varying stories from witnesses .
“ There appears to be a degree of planning that went into this , ” said San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan . “ Nobody just gets upset at a party and goes home and plans an attack like that . ”
The State Department confirmed Thursday that Malik held a Pakistani passport and was in the U.S. on a K-1 visa reserved for fiancees of U.S. citizens . Department spokesman Mark Toner told reporters that Malik was granted the visa in Islamabad and would have had to undergo “ counterterrorism screening ” to receive the document from U.S. authorities .
While other officials said the visa was issued in 2014 , details about international travel by Farook ’ s and Malik ’ s travels were not fully clear .
Investigators said Farook traveled at one point to Pakistan before returning to the U.S. in July 2014 with his bride-to-be . Sources also confirmed that Farook went to Saudi Arabia for nine days in summer 2014 . It was unclear whether the couple traveled to other countries together .
Mr. Toner told reporters that the State Department does not track the movements of U.S. citizens overseas .
The official who spoke anonymously with The Times said it was entirely possible that the couple had contact with extremists during their foreign travels or while in the U.S. , but that the extent of those contacts was unclear .
“ If you ’ re in a minority in whatever country you ’ re in , a lot of the relationships may be tight-knit , so the chance that you ’ re going to have contacts with people that may be of interest to authorities , that ’ s plausible , ” the official said . “ But the chance that there ’ s a close relationship there is unknown and won ’ t be known until further investigation . ”
Farook ’ s brother-in-law , Farhan Khan , said Wednesday that he was shocked by Farook ’ s actions .
“ I have no idea , no idea , why he would do that . Why he would do something like this , ” Mr. Khan said .
Two weeks ago , Farook and one of the co-workers he killed , 52-year-old Nicholas Thalasinos , had a heated conversation about Islam , according to Kuuleme Stephens , a friend of the victim ’ s .
Ms. Stephens said she happened to call Mr. Thalasinos while he was at work and having a discussion with Farook . She said Mr. Thalasinos told her that Farook “ doesn ’ t agree that Islam is not a peaceful religion . ”
Other co-workers recalled bits and pieces about the man , whom many viewed as mild-mannered and happy .
Co-worker Patrick Baccari said he was sitting at the same table as Farook during the holiday party when he suddenly disappeared . Mr. Baccari said that when the shooting started , he took refuge in a bathroom and suffered minor wounds from shrapnel slicing through the wall .
The shooting lasted about five minutes , he said , and when he looked in the mirror he realized he was bleeding .
“ If I hadn ’ t been in the bathroom , I ’ d probably be laying dead on the floor , ” he said .

""I don't see anything in reviewing our work that our agents should have done differently,"" FBI Director James Comey said.



But why was the killer allowed to walk into a gun store and buy firearms despite the fact that he had once been under FBI surveillance for nearly a year?

Witnesses now say that Mateen was a regular at the Pulse nightclub and dated men. Officials say he also scouted Disney World for a possible attack.

Meanwhile, as the investigation continues, the shooting has taken over the presidential campaign.



After President Barack Obama refused to even utter the words 'Muslim' or 'Islamic terrorism' in his statement on the Orlando massacre, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump expanded his proposed Muslim ban.

Authorities surrounded an apartment complex where they believe alleged gunman Travis Reinking , 29 , may be hiding after he shot at patrons at a Waffle House in Antioch , located about 16 miles southeast of downtown Nashville . They reportedly later cleared the area after it appeared Reinking was not there .
`` A man believed to be Travis Reinking was last seen in a wood line near Discovery at Mountain View Apts . on Mountain Springs Dr. near the Waffle House . The man was seen wearing black pants and no shirt , '' Nashville police tweeted just after 8 a.m. Sunday , the last time he was spotted .
Don Aaron , spokesman of the Metro Nashville Police Department , initially told WTVF : `` If you see a nude guy walking around this morning call the police department . ''
Reinking , who was last spotted with black pants and no shirt on after fleeing the scene naked , pulled up to the restaurant in his pickup truck about 3:25 a.m. and fatally shot two people outside with an assault-type rifle , police said . The alleged shooter then gunned down patrons dining inside , killing at least one person . Another individual died at the hospital .
Chuck Cordero , who is a regular customer and friends with the employees at the Waffle House , told WTVF he was waiting outside the restaurant when he heard gunshots . Cordero said the restaurant was busy and he was waiting for the booth he usually sits in to clear out .
`` I showed up tonight and they were a little busy so I stayed in my car . As I got out , this lunatic in a pickup pulled up , '' Cordero said . `` [ The gunman ] shot a customer going in the door , shot my friend on sidewalk , shot through windows and then went in shooting . He pulled up , got right out ; he was prepared to do what he did . ''
A 29-year-old patron , identified as James Shaw Jr. , was attempting to flee the gunfire when he saw the shooter struggling with the rifle at one point . Shaw told the Tennessean he saw an opportunity and charged at the shooter , wrestled the weapon away and tossed it over the restaurant ’ s counter .
`` He is the hero here and no doubt he saved many lives by wrestling the gun away , '' Aaron said .
Cordero said he also saw a man who `` jumped in '' as the gunman was reloading the rifle .
`` There 's a gentleman who was in there that when the guy stopped to reload his gun he jumped him , '' Cordero recalled . `` Had that guy reloaded , there was plenty of people in that restaurant that would not have made it home this morning . ''
Shaw suffered an elbow injury and other abrasions when he was grazed by a bullet . He was treated for his injuries and released from the hospital .
At least two of the four injured suffered gunshot wounds . One person is said to be in critical condition and another is in critical but stable condition , FOX17 reported . Aaron said some people at the restaurant had `` visible cuts '' on their faces due to flying glass when shots were fired .
`` The people inside the restaurant were very very shaken . They were in tears , '' Aaron said . `` Some of the folks who didn ’ t have to be transported [ to the hospital ] had glass wounds on their faces . ”
Police initially described the gunman as a man with short hair who was last seen walking on Murfreesboro Pike after the shooting . They added that Reinking allegedly shed his green coat after firing his gun and is nude . Reinking reportedly then ran to a nearby apartment complex , where he lives , and put pants , Aaron said . Several residents in the area reported seeing a naked man in the area .
Authorities identified Reinking as the suspect after finding the vehicle allegedly used by the gunman was registered in that name . Aaron said officials are still gathering information on Reinking , but found that the alleged gunman ’ s license “ goes back to Illinois. ” Nashville police checked with authorities in Illinois who said Reinking has a history with firearms in that state .
The motive of the deadly shooting or why Reinking was in Nashville is still unclear .

Before Dickson and Trooper Alex Douglass were shot outside the state police barracks in Blooming Grove on September 12 , Frein had been mulling an ambush for months , authorities say .
`` Based on our investigations , we know Frein has prepared and planned extensively for months or maybe years , '' State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens said Sunday .
Investigators know Frein `` has made statements about wanting to kill law enforcement officers and also to commit mass acts of murder , '' State Police Commissioner Frank Noonan said last week .
`` He has very strong feelings about law enforcement and seems to be very angry with a lot of things that go on in our society . ''
Bivens said while Frein planned his attack and retreat , `` we believe we are closing in on him . ''
Up to 400 law enforcement officers are searching for Frein , including members of the FBI , the U.S . Marshals Service and the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives .
They 've zeroed in on the woods not far from Frein 's family home in Canadensis -- about 20 miles from where Dickson and Douglass were shot .
His evasiveness has led schools to cancel classes and prompted authorities to ask hunters to avoid the woods in the area .
Although Frein is on the run and possibly armed , there is no indication that he is a danger to anyone other than law enforcement , Bivens said .
`` I am convinced that Frein has engaged in a personal battle with law enforcement , specifically the Pennsylvania State Police , and will likely stay focused on that fight , '' he said .
Frein claims to have fought with Serbians in Africa and has studied Russian and Serbian languages , according to the FBI
He even belonged to a simulation group that re-enacted Cold War-era European conflicts , officials said .
The simulation group , which police declined to name , would use non-lethal Airsoft guns .
But authorities believe Frein has turned a non-lethal activity lethal .
`` It is believed that Frein has assumed the simulation role , and is now acting it out in real life , '' Bivens said .
Frein started wearing a `` mohawk '' -type haircut -- different from what he had worn for years -- apparently as part of his mental preparation for his attacks on the troopers , Bivens said .
While authorities believe Frein has an intense grudge against law enforcement , one friend said his angst is actually against the federal government .
`` He definitely let his opinions about the government be known , '' the friend , who wanted to be identified only as `` Jack , '' told CNN .
`` He was obviously a big critic of the federal government , but he never specifically targeted police when he was talking to me , '' Jack said . `` No indications of really any malice towards law enforcement in particular . Most of his aggression was ( toward ) the federal government . ''
But others close to Frein told investigators that he had talked about his disdain for law enforcement , authorities said .
`` This was nothing he kept quiet , '' Noonan said , adding that he wished those people had spoken up before the shootings .
A trail of clues led authorities to execute a search warrant on the suspect 's family 's home . That 's when Frein 's father told authorities that two firearms were missing , according to a probable cause affidavit .
The father said one of those missing firearms was an AK-47 ; the other was a .308 rifle , which police believe was the same type of rifle used to shoot the troopers .
The father said his son grew up with guns and was a member of his high school 's rifle club .

Frein started wearing a ""mohawk""-type haircut -- different from what he had worn for years -- apparently as part of his mental preparation for his attacks on the troopers, Bivens said.

He harbors a grudge against cops

While authorities believe Frein has an intense grudge against law enforcement, one friend said his angst is actually against the federal government.

""He definitely let his opinions about the government be known,"" the friend, who wanted to be identified only as ""Jack,"" told CNN.

""He was obviously a big critic of the federal government, but he never specifically targeted police when he was talking to me,"" Jack said. ""No indications of really any malice towards law enforcement in particular. Most of his aggression was (toward) the federal government.""

But others close to Frein told investigators that he had talked about his disdain for law enforcement, authorities said.

""This was nothing he kept quiet,"" Noonan said, adding that he wished those people had spoken up before the shootings.

He's a skilled marksman

A trail of clues led authorities to execute a search warrant on the suspect's family's home. That's when Frein's father told authorities that two firearms were missing, according to a probable cause affidavit.

The father said one of those missing firearms was an AK-47; the other was a .308 rifle, which police believe was the same type of rifle used to shoot the troopers.

The father said his son grew up with guns and was a member of his high school's rifle club.

When Frein shoots, his father told authorities, he ""doesn't miss.""",www.cnn.com,left,Ad2xfRUKWwBh5PYc

For two months , police concerned with the bikers ' presence at Twin Peaks , which hosted special events for its leather-clad clientele , had patrolled outside -- and not in plain clothes and unmarked cars , either .

The death of Freddie Gray was a homicide , and six Baltimore police officers now face criminal charges that include second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter , Baltimore chief prosecutor Marilyn J. Mosby says .
Mosby announced the charges Friday morning , citing her office 's `` thorough and independent '' investigation and the medical examiner 's report on Gray 's death . She said warrants were issued Friday for the officers ' arrest .
The city 's recently elected state 's attorney , Mosby detailed a range of charges against the officers , with offenses ranging from one count of second-degree murder and four counts of involuntary manslaughter to assault and misconduct in office .
The most severe charges are leveled against Officer Caesar R. Goodson Jr. , identified as the driver of the van that transported Gray to a police station . The charges against Goodson include second-degree depraved heart murder , which carries a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison .
The investigation by the prosecutor 's office found there had been no reason to detain Gray — and that his arrest was in itself illegal , Mosby said . She said the knife that police officers found on Gray turned out to be legal .
After announcing the charges , Mosby noted her own ties to the police community — including her mother , father and grandfather , who were police officers . She thanked officers who are committed to serving the community .

She said that her review of the case found there had been no reason to detain Gray , and that his arrest was illegal .
The leading prosecutor in Baltimore spoke at a 10:30 a.m . ET news conference held in downtown Baltimore . The occasion brought a large show of force from both police and National Guard personnel who have been called on to secure the area since violence and vandalism broke out Monday night .

As the Two-Way has reported , when police turned over the documents to State 's Attorney Marilyn Mosby in Baltimore , they announced that `` the van transporting Freddie Gray , the 25-year-old black man who suffered a serious spine injury while in police custody and later died , made one more stop than previously thought . ''
The roughly 40 minutes that Gray spent in the van have emerged as the focal point in the inquiry over how he sustained the injury .
That extra stop was discovered through a review of recordings made by security and private cameras , Deputy Police Commissioner Kevin Davis said . He added that another detainee who was riding in the van told police that Gray was `` still moving around ... kicking and making noises '' until the van reached the police station .
That second detainee rode in the police van on the other side of a metal partition that divides its cargo space . When he was picked up , Gray was already in the van .
Local news WJZ-TV reports that Donta Allen , 22 , was that second man — and that he came forward Thursday out of concern over how his comments were being portrayed by both the police and the media .
`` When I was in the back of that van it did not stop or nothing . All it did was go straight to the station , but I heard a little banging , like he was banging his head , '' Allen said. `` I did n't even know he was in the van until we got to the station . ''
Saying his words have been distorted by recent reports and that he does n't think Gray hurt himself intentionally , Allen also told a WJZ reporter , `` The only reason I 'm doing this is because they put my name in a bad state . ''
Allen , who was reportedly taken into custody for a minor offense and was not charged with a crime , also spoke to WBAL TV . He told the station that when he got into the van , he did n't know Gray was already there . He said he heard `` a little banging for like four seconds . ''

The police who faced protesters in Ferguson, Missouri looked more like soldiers than officers of the peace. In August, citizens squared off with a camouflage-clad police force armed with tear gas and grenade launchers, armored tactical vehicles and rifles with long-range scopes. Since then, government officials and the media have blamed police militarization on a U.S. Department of Defense program, begun in 1997, that provides police with free surplus military gear. But the roots of militarized policing are much older.

To find the origins of modern militarized policing, we have to look back to the Cold War. Starting in the 1950s, the defense department spent millions of dollars on studies that tried to explain how communists gained followers around the world.

Researchers working at military-funded think tanks such as RAND and the Special Operations Research Office examined how insurgents in Latin America and Southeast Asia lured people into trying to overthrow U.S.-backed governments. This research was guided by the belief that communist activities abroad threatened national security at home. The military's researchers wrote dozens of reports that explained how underground communist movements worked. Their recommendation: the U.S. government should create training programs for police overseas. Suggested topics for instruction included surveillance methods, riot control techniques, and paramilitary tactics.

Then in the late 1960s, the military's researchers made a profitable discovery: the U.S. Department of Justice and local police departments would pay them to bring their research home. Researchers applied their knowledge about foreign communists in an attempt to help police deal with protesters on U.S. soil. Military experts advised police on how to contain civil rights demonstrations calling for political and economic equality and how to control demonstrations against the Vietnam War.

By bringing home tools and ideas created to control foreign political movements, the military's researchers treated dissenting Americans the same way they treated the nation's enemies abroad. The language they used in their reports showed their assumptions. One Department of Justice-funded study called student activists ""revolutionaries, known trouble makers, and other anti-social elements.""

This research treated dissent as disloyalty. It treated protest as a threat to national security and stability, and assumed that protests, if left uncontrolled, might destabilize the government. So that demonstrations did not escalate into revolution, researchers told law enforcement to use tear gas when protesters gathered. This was already common practice in many localities, but the military's experts gave police a scholarly justification for these kinds of heavy-handed actions.

Minority communities often bore the brunt of these practices. The idea that civil rights activists were similar to the nation's foreign enemies was hardly a leap for the Pentagon's experts. They warned repeatedly that ""underground black organizations"" — which is how they described civil rights organizations — might be planning ""widespread campaigns of violence."" Their ultimate fear was race war.

American law enforcement listened all too well to these voices from the Pentagon. The FBI monitored Martin Luther King Jr for more than a decade in a fruitless search for communist connections. And the CIA ran Operation CHAOS, an intelligence program that tried to discredit prominent American civil rights and anti-war activists by searching for communist puppet-masters abroad.

Neither operation found what it was looking for, but suspicion of protest movements lives on.

Assumptions about protest continue to play out in the United States. From the 1999 Seattle World Trade Organization protests, to the Occupy Movement, to Ferguson, police have continued to confront peaceful protests with strong shows of force. My research suggests they do not do this simply because they have the equipment. They do it because, since the 1960s, police have often seen domestic social movements as threats to national security and domestic stability.

According to my research, militarization is a mindset. It is a tendency to see the world through the lens of national security, a tendency to exaggerate existing threats. In policing, this can manifest itself as a belief that physical security and calm are more important than civil liberties and that dissent can be dangerous to national security. This same mindset encourages police to treat protesting populations — and in particular minority populations — as if they might undermine the government.

All of which leads to the question: which is more dangerous to democracy — the small-scale violence that might occasionally accompany protest, or a militarized police force?

As a reporter , I ’ ve talked to immigration activists for the better part of a decade . They don ’ t often cry , at least not in front of me .
But all day on Sunday , the day after the shooting in El Paso , hardened advocates became emotional while explaining what it ’ s like to live in the United States after a killer drove 10 hours to kill Mexicans , Latinos and immigrants . The next day I still felt restless after a conversation with a friend . She had been crying because her husband overheard white men at the community pool remarking that while they didn ’ t agree with the killings — how magnanimous — they , too , didn ’ t want white people to be “ wiped out ” and for Hispanics to “ take over . ”
Where was this said ? The deeply Republican city of Los Angeles , of course .
“ He openly was discussing this like it was sports talk , ” she told me , furious . “ After 20 people are dead . ”
The news media ’ s approach to its coverage of the El Paso shooting has obscured what made it uniquely horrifying for the Latino community . From the moment the shots were fired , this was a trend story : Another mass shooting , so let ’ s restart our debates about gun control and mental illness , maybe pull up some video game b-roll . And after so many shootings in recent years , journalists have decided it ’ s wrong to give too much attention to the shooter , so we downplayed his name and face , his bizarre and hateful manifesto .
But the media ’ s desire to erase the shooter and his ideology ended up erasing his victims and their community , too . While the news media successfully portrayed this shooting as part of a national epidemic of mass killings , we failed to accurately convey how this one was different . The visceral emotions of the Latinos I spoke with should have been—and should still be—front and center .
After years of covering immigration , I thought I understood how immigrants felt , because of our similar backgrounds . But I didn ’ t , not really . I ’ m Puerto Rican and Ecuadorian and from New York . Like many Hispanics , I ’ ve known undocumented people , but while I could empathize with immigrants going through hardship , that ’ s not the same as sharing their experience .
This killer expressly traveled to a city filled with Mexicans and immigrants . This is new territory . The El Paso shooting isn ’ t just a sad moment that will pass , but the culmination of an anti-immigrant four decades in politics that ratcheted up in the 1990s and 2000s and has become only louder , emboldened and unchecked by American leaders , led by the president but certainly not just by him .
Of the 49 victims three years ago at Pulse , a gay nightclub in Orlando , 90 percent were Latino . Almost half were Puerto Rican . Others were Colombians , Mexicans and Dominicans . But what makes El Paso different is that people were targeted , not by someone pledging themselves to ISIS , but to white supremacy .
“ Now Hispanic Americans have been targeted , some who are immigrants , and all who have limited political power , ” I wrote on Twitter on Tuesday . “ That ’ s what ’ s going on . And people are terrified . ”
I received more than 160 private messages on Twitter along with some emails and texts from people who told me they didn ’ t have a safe space to share these stories .
They were from immigrants and people born in this country just like me . They were from older people scared for their children and grandchildren , but also from teenagers , heartbreakingly young teens of 16 and 17 , who shouldn ’ t have to worry that someone is going to tell them to “ go back to Mexico ” and threaten to attack them while walking their dog if they don ’ t cross the street now . They were from people in red states and blue states , the united states of hating immigrants and people who just look like they might be . They were from biracial people , but also from white people who explained that their sister had married a Latino man and that means they have two Latina nieces , or a grandson , and they ’ re scared of the ways their neighbors might try to hurt them — with words they won ’ t forget or violence that could take them away forever .
A Latina in a predominantly Hispanic border city “ very much like El Paso ” told me she has a new job , overseeing a team of mostly Hispanic staff , with her name on the door — something to really be proud of . But instead she ’ s terrified , she said , because the office is marketed toward Latinos and that means she feels like a target .
A Dreamer in Texas told me he was terrified of taking his son to stores or crowded places , and said he warned his parents not to speak Spanish in public . A first-generation Salvadoran man with a wife who is white said they just had a baby boy four weeks ago . He said he has told her he hopes the baby doesn ’ t have dark skin .
A white man said his Latina wife from the Rio Grande Valley broke down after reading the shooter ’ s manifesto . She told him she ’ s sorry if their future kids are targets because of her .
There were people who said they wish they didn ’ t have an accent so they could pass as white , and others who said they are ashamed to be relieved they can pass as white . “ We ’ re not fine , ” a resident of a border town wrote to me .
And then the process started all over again . A massive Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid at seven food processing plants in Morton , Mississippi , led to the arrests of 680 undocumented workers , a record .

As a reporter, I’ve talked to immigration activists for the better part of a decade. They don’t often cry, at least not in front of me.

But all day on Sunday, the day after the shooting in El Paso, hardened advocates became emotional while explaining what it’s like to live in the United States after a killer drove 10 hours to kill Mexicans, Latinos and immigrants. The next day I still felt restless after a conversation with a friend. She had been crying because her husband overheard white men at the community pool remarking that while they didn’t agree with the killings — how magnanimous — they, too, didn’t want white people to be “wiped out” and for Hispanics to “take over.”

Story Continued Below

Where was this said? The deeply Republican city of Los Angeles, of course.

“He openly was discussing this like it was sports talk,” she told me, furious. “After 20 people are dead.”

The news media’s approach to its coverage of the El Paso shooting has obscured what made it uniquely horrifying for the Latino community. From the moment the shots were fired, this was a trend story: Another mass shooting, so let’s restart our debates about gun control and mental illness, maybe pull up some video game b-roll. And after so many shootings in recent years, journalists have decided it’s wrong to give too much attention to the shooter, so we downplayed his name and face, his bizarre and hateful manifesto.

But the media’s desire to erase the shooter and his ideology ended up erasing his victims and their community, too. While the news media successfully portrayed this shooting as part of a national epidemic of mass killings, we failed to accurately convey how this one was different. The visceral emotions of the Latinos I spoke with should have been—and should still be—front and center.

After years of covering immigration, I thought I understood how immigrants felt, because of our similar backgrounds. But I didn’t, not really. I’m Puerto Rican and Ecuadorian and from New York. Like many Hispanics, I’ve known undocumented people, but while I could empathize with immigrants going through hardship, that’s not the same as sharing their experience.

This killer expressly traveled to a city filled with Mexicans and immigrants. This is new territory. The El Paso shooting isn’t just a sad moment that will pass, but the culmination of an anti-immigrant four decades in politics that ratcheted up in the 1990s and 2000s and has become only louder, emboldened and unchecked by American leaders, led by the president but certainly not just by him.

Of the 49 victims three years ago at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, 90 percent were Latino. Almost half were Puerto Rican. Others were Colombians, Mexicans and Dominicans. But what makes El Paso different is that people were targeted, not by someone pledging themselves to ISIS, but to white supremacy.

“Now Hispanic Americans have been targeted, some who are immigrants, and all who have limited political power,” I wrote on Twitter on Tuesday. “That’s what’s going on. And people are terrified.”

Then the messages starting coming in.

I received more than 160 private messages on Twitter along with some emails and texts from people who told me they didn’t have a safe space to share these stories.

They were from immigrants and people born in this country just like me. They were from older people scared for their children and grandchildren, but also from teenagers, heartbreakingly young teens of 16 and 17, who shouldn’t have to worry that someone is going to tell them to “go back to Mexico” and threaten to attack them while walking their dog if they don’t cross the street now. They were from people in red states and blue states, the united states of hating immigrants and people who just look like they might be. They were from biracial people, but also from white people who explained that their sister had married a Latino man and that means they have two Latina nieces, or a grandson, and they’re scared of the ways their neighbors might try to hurt them — with words they won’t forget or violence that could take them away forever.

A Latina in a predominantly Hispanic border city “very much like El Paso” told me she has a new job, overseeing a team of mostly Hispanic staff, with her name on the door — something to really be proud of. But instead she’s terrified, she said, because the office is marketed toward Latinos and that means she feels like a target.

A Dreamer in Texas told me he was terrified of taking his son to stores or crowded places, and said he warned his parents not to speak Spanish in public. A first-generation Salvadoran man with a wife who is white said they just had a baby boy four weeks ago. He said he has told her he hopes the baby doesn’t have dark skin.

A white man said his Latina wife from the Rio Grande Valley broke down after reading the shooter’s manifesto. She told him she’s sorry if their future kids are targets because of her.

There were people who said they wish they didn’t have an accent so they could pass as white, and others who said they are ashamed to be relieved they can pass as white. “We’re not fine,” a resident of a border town wrote to me.

And then the process started all over again. A massive Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid at seven food processing plants in Morton, Mississippi, led to the arrests of 680 undocumented workers, a record. Children cried outside the gates for their parents. Wives came to the scene to say goodbye to their husbands. It was a new method for separating families, but with the same result.

At first I didn’t watch the video of 11-year-old Magdalena Gomez Gregorio tearfully begging the government to release her father every time it popped up online, because while as a journalist I understand the news value of these images to show the human cost of Trump’s immigration policy, I’ve personally found it hard to continue looking at haunting images like it. I remember little Jakelin, 7, who died of dehydration in U.S. custody last year, or Oscar Alberto Martínez Ramírez and his 23-month-old daughter, Angie Valeria, face down in the Rio Grande in June, their tragedy transformed into a small part of the perpetual motion machine of online content. But I watched the video as I wrote this paragraph, of her asking the government to “please show some heart,” between sobs, while adding that her father is not a criminal.

Like her, many Hispanics are worried. They live in parts of the South where there aren’t many Latinos, but also in majority-Hispanic areas where the actions of an outsider coming to a border town to kill means the cocoon of community doesn’t present the sense of protection it once did. But even in this dark moment there are hopeful signs.

The Latino community in the United States is not monolithic. At most, we have a shared language that not all speak. But I’ve seen a growing awareness of people sticking together online, as people check on one another on Instagram, in person and on the phone. There is fear, but people are also resolute that things will get better. And some wanted to make clear to me that while they’re well aware of how deeply awful this moment is, they still stand in defiance of those who would instill fear.

“I am done being terrorized,” one young man wrote to me. “My stepdad didn’t march and organize in the Chicano movement for our generation to live in fear.”

And while I think the news media should do better to contextualize the El Paso attack as a toxic brew of American gun culture and hatred of Latinos, there has been a lot of good coverage, too. Univision preempted its programming with a prime-time special by Jorge Ramos and Patricia Janiot titled “Hispanics in the Crosshairs,” and Telemundo’s José Díaz-Balart interviewed El Paso victims from the hospital, sharing Spanish-language texts exchanged between a mother and her daughter. Cassandra Jaramillo and Alfredo Corchado of the Dallas Morning News filed big-hearted stories from El Paso that centered on local heroes and spotlighted the community’s pain, and the Los Angeles Times reporters Esmeralda Bermudez, Paloma Esquivel and Cindy Carcamo elevated the voices of Latino residents and grappled with the Trump factor.

I believe in and am still awed by the power of journalism, of documenting people’s stories so better-informed citizens can rally around their neighbors and cast out the ignorance that led to this shameful stain on our country’s history. As one person, who came to the country legally at the age of 19, wrote to me, the pain is relatively recent, but there is an antidote.

“It is really the last few months that I feel not wanted by my fellow Americans and it hurts,” she wrote. “It hurts because we contribute to the economy, to the food and the culture.

""Help! Help me!""

A young woman's desperate cries alerted neighbors Monday to a frightening tale in Cleveland.

As we reported last evening, three young women who had gone missing between 2002 and 2004 were found Monday afternoon inside a home where the shades were said to be always drawn. No one who lives nearby seems to have suspected that there might be kidnapping victims inside.

Key Developments — Three young women, Amanda Berry (27), Gina DeJesus (23) and Michelle Knight (32) were found Monday evening at a home in Cleveland after Berry's frantic cries for help brought a neighbor to the door. With them was a 6-year-old girl who police say is Berry's daughter. — The three women, all from the Cleveland area, had been missing for many years — Knight since 2002, Berry since 2003 and DeJesus since 2004. They have all been treated and released at a Cleveland-area hospital. — Three brothers have been arrested, but not yet charged, in relation to the women's disappearances. They are: 52-year-old Ariel Castro, 54-year-old Pedro Castro and 50-year-old Onil Castro. — As of midday Tuesday, authorities had not released any details about what they found inside the home or exactly what they've learned from the three women.

The women are Amanda Berry (27), Gina DeJesus (23) and Michelle Knight (32), whose disappearances generated much attention in local media over the past decade. Three brothers in their 50s have been arrested.

According to The Associated Press: ""Berry disappeared at age 16 on April 21, 2003, when she called her sister to say she was getting a ride home from her job at a Burger King. About a year later, DeJesus vanished at age 14 on her way home from school. Police said Knight disappeared in 2002 and is 32 now.""

It 's far from the first instance of extreme right-wing terrorism in the U.S .
Since 9/11 , more have died in far-right violence than Islamic terrorism , Bergen says
Bergen : Authorities should pay more attention to the threat posed by homegrown extremists
On Sunday , Jerad and Amanda Miller , a married couple , allegedly killed two police officers in an ambush at a Las Vegas pizza restaurant and then murdered another person in an adjacent Walmart . During the attack , the couple reportedly stated that their attack was part of a `` revolution , '' according to Second Assistant Sheriff Kevin McMahill .
The Millers appear to have been motivated by extreme far-right views . The couple left a flag at the scene of the crime with the words `` Do n't Tread on Me , '' a Revolutionary War symbol used by some anti-government extremists .
They also left a swastika at the scene , though McMahill cautioned to reporters , `` We do n't necessary believe that they are white supremacists or associated with the Nazi movement . We believe that they equate government and law enforcement ... with Nazis . ''
McMahill added an assessment of the Millers ' ideological roots saying , `` There is no doubt that the suspects have some apparent ideology that 's along the lines of militia and white supremacists . ''
McMahill also confirmed that Jerad Miller had written on his Facebook page that he had been ejected from the Bundy Ranch , the Nevada site where armed ranchers as well some with anti-government militia ties held off federal officials at gunpoint in April . However , McMahill was not able to confirm Miller 's actual presence at the ranch . ( Cliven Bundy 's son Ammon said that `` state militia members '' told him the Millers had been at the ranch , but were asked by a militia member to leave because of `` their radical beliefs . '' )
The attack in Vegas is far from the only incident of violence by the American far right . According to data collected by the New America Foundation , right-wing extremists have killed 37 people in 16 violent incidents , in the United States since the 9/11 attacks . That number is more than the 21 people killed by militants motivated by al-Qaeda 's ideology in the United States in the post-9/11 era .
Although a variety of left wing militants and environmental extremists have carried out violent attacks for political reasons against property and individuals since 9/11 , none have been linked to a lethal attack .
As we pointed out in this space less than two months ago , a man shot and killed a 14-year-old boy and his grandfather at the Jewish Community Center of Greater Kansas City and then drove to a nearby Jewish retirement community where he shot and killed a third person . Police arrested a suspect , Frazier Glenn Cross , who shouted `` Heil Hitler '' after he was taken into custody .

JUST WATCHED Cop killers had extremist views Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Cop killers had extremist views 06:56
Cross , who also goes by Frazier Glenn Miller , is a well-known right-wing extremist who founded the Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan and the White Patriot Party , according to the Southern Poverty Law Center .
A similar attack to the one that Frazier Glenn Cross is accused of in Kansas occurred in August 2012 when Wade Michael Page killed six people in a shooting at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin . Page was a member of a white supremacist band and associated with the Hammerskins , a white supremacist group . Page committed suicide during the attack .
Page is not , of course , the only right-wing extremist to have used lethal violence to achieve political ends . In 2009 , for instance , Shawna Forde , Albert Gaxiola , and Jason Bush raided a house in Arizona , killing Raul Flores and his daughter Brisenia . The three attackers sought to use the burglary to finance their anti-immigration vigilante group , Minutemen American Defense . Forde and Bush were convicted and sentenced to death . Gaxiola was sentenced to life in prison .
Also in 2009 , Scott Roeder murdered Dr. George Tiller , who ran an abortion clinic in Wichita , Kansas . In 2010 Roeder was convicted of first-degree murder . According to the Southern Poverty Law Center , Roeder not only had ties to the extreme anti-abortion movement , but he also had been pulled over while driving with a fake license plate bearing the markings of the Sovereign Citizens , a movement of individuals who deny that the government has authority over them .
Of course , the deadliest terrorist attack on American soil prior to 9/11 was the Oklahoma City bombing , which was masterminded by Timothy McVeigh , a man with deep ties to far-right militant circles . McVeigh killed 168 people when he bombed the Alfred P. Murrah federal building on April 19 , 1995 .
Despite the history of deadly violence by individuals motivated by political ideologies other than that of al Qaeda , it is jihadist violence that continues to dominate the news and the attention of policy makers . Some of this is quite understandable . After all , on 9/11 al Qaeda 's 19 terrorists killed almost 3,000 people in the space of a morning . Since then al Qaeda 's branch in Yemen tried to bring down -- with a bomb secreted on a passenger -- an American commercial jet flying over Detroit on Christmas Day 2009 and al Qaeda 's branch in Pakistan tried to launch bombings on the New York subway system a few months earlier . Luckily those plots did n't succeed , but certainly if they had , the death toll would have been on a large scale .
Yet the disparity in media coverage can have serious consequences . McMahill told reporters that he had heard reports that the Millers had spoken to a neighbor about their plans adding `` You know we have the 'see something , say something ' campaign , '' and urged that , `` We need to hear about those times when individuals or groups of individuals are talking about going out and committing acts of violence -- whether it 's against the police or anybody else in our community . ''
Indeed , in a report on countering radicalization in Muslim communities , the Muslim Public Affairs Council emphasized the need to inform law enforcement when an individual is ejected from a community for being extreme .
Countering violent extremism can not simply be a demand placed on Muslim communities to prevent jihadist violence . In the decade since 9/11 right-wing extremists have demonstrated their ability to be just as deadly as their homegrown jihadist counterparts .
Moreover , killings like the ones of the two police officers in Las Vegas on Sunday demonstrate the need to move beyond the view that the only threat of terrorism or extremist violence comes from radicalized Muslims .
A promising development to that end is that U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced last week that he is reconstituting a Justice Department task force on domestic terrorism , focused on anti-government plots and racial violence . The task force was originally launched after the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing .","Story highlights Peter Bergen: Shooters in Las Vegas murders had extremist, anti-government views

The attack in Vegas is far from the only incident of violence by the American far right. According to data collected by the New America Foundation , right-wing extremists have killed 37 people in 16 violent incidents, in the United States since the 9/11 attacks. That number is more than the 21 people killed by militants motivated by al-Qaeda's ideology in the United States in the post-9/11 era.

Although a variety of left wing militants and environmental extremists have carried out violent attacks for political reasons against property and individuals since 9/11, none have been linked to a lethal attack.

As we pointed out in this space less than two months ago, a man shot and killed a 14-year-old boy and his grandfather at the Jewish Community Center of Greater Kansas City and then drove to a nearby Jewish retirement community where he shot and killed a third person. Police arrested a suspect, Frazier Glenn Cross, who shouted ""Heil Hitler"" after he was taken into custody.

Cross, who also goes by Frazier Glenn Miller, is a well-known right-wing extremist who founded the Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan and the White Patriot Party, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.

A similar attack to the one that Frazier Glenn Cross is accused of in Kansas occurred in August 2012 when Wade Michael Page killed six people in a shooting at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin. Page was a member of a white supremacist band and associated with the Hammerskins, a white supremacist group. Page committed suicide during the attack.

Page is not, of course, the only right-wing extremist to have used lethal violence to achieve political ends. In 2009, for instance, Shawna Forde, Albert Gaxiola, and Jason Bush raided a house in Arizona, killing Raul Flores and his daughter Brisenia. The three attackers sought to use the burglary to finance their anti-immigration vigilante group, Minutemen American Defense. Forde and Bush were convicted and sentenced to death . Gaxiola was sentenced to life in prison.

Also in 2009, Scott Roeder murdered Dr. George Tiller, who ran an abortion clinic in Wichita, Kansas. In 2010 Roeder was convicted of first-degree murder . According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, Roeder not only had ties to the extreme anti-abortion movement, but he also had been pulled over while driving with a fake license plate bearing the markings of the Sovereign Citizens, a movement of individuals who deny that the government has authority over them.

Of course, the deadliest terrorist attack on American soil prior to 9/11 was the Oklahoma City bombing, which was masterminded by Timothy McVeigh, a man with deep ties to far-right militant circles. McVeigh killed 168 people when he bombed the Alfred P. Murrah federal building on April 19, 1995.

Despite the history of deadly violence by individuals motivated by political ideologies other than that of al Qaeda, it is jihadist violence that continues to dominate the news and the attention of policy makers. Some of this is quite understandable. After all, on 9/11 al Qaeda's 19 terrorists killed almost 3,000 people in the space of a morning. Since then al Qaeda's branch in Yemen tried to bring down -- with a bomb secreted on a passenger -- an American commercial jet flying over Detroit on Christmas Day 2009 and al Qaeda's branch in Pakistan tried to launch bombings on the New York subway system a few months earlier. Luckily those plots didn't succeed, but certainly if they had, the death toll would have been on a large scale.

Yet the disparity in media coverage can have serious consequences. McMahill told reporters that he had heard reports that the Millers had spoken to a neighbor about their plans adding ""You know we have the 'see something, say something' campaign,"" and urged that , ""We need to hear about those times when individuals or groups of individuals are talking about going out and committing acts of violence -- whether it's against the police or anybody else in our community.""

Indeed, in a report on countering radicalization in Muslim communities, the Muslim Public Affairs Council emphasized the need to inform law enforcement when an individual is ejected from a community for being extreme.

Countering violent extremism cannot simply be a demand placed on Muslim communities to prevent jihadist violence. In the decade since 9/11 right-wing extremists have demonstrated their ability to be just as deadly as their homegrown jihadist counterparts.

Moreover, killings like the ones of the two police officers in Las Vegas on Sunday demonstrate the need to move beyond the view that the only threat of terrorism or extremist violence comes from radicalized Muslims.

A promising development to that end is that U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced last week that he is reconstituting a Justice Department task force on domestic terrorism, focused on anti-government plots and racial violence. The task force was originally launched after the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing.",www.cnn.com,left,QfoaNLDtPhgpvDOr

The U.S. Civil Rights Commission refuses to condemn antifa violence.

One of the great gifts the British writer George Orwell gave us, in addition to his classics 1984 and Animal Farm, was a clear and uncompromising look at dangerous ideologies. In “Orwell and the British Left,” British writer Ian Williams recalls Orwell’s underlining of “the old, true and unpalatable conclusion that a Communist and a Fascist are somewhat nearer to one another than either is to a democrat.” Orwell’s well-observed conclusion nonetheless scandalized many on the left who rallied behind the Marxist phrase “no enemies on the left.”

Sadly, a quarter century after the fall of Communism, too many leftists are still ignoring Orwell and refusing to acknowledge the reality of left-wing brutality. In the wake of Charlottesville, eyewitnesses and reporters agreed that while the violence was instigated by neo-Nazis and white nationalists, it was countered with bloody counterattacks by left-wingers and black-shirted anarchists wearing masks. There was a clear asymmetric outcome to the violence: A white nationalist mowed down protestors with his car, killing a 32-year-old woman.

But that didn’t mean there were no victims of left-wing violence. Antifa — short for “anti-fascist” — protestors came armed with pepper spray, bricks, and clubs. Antifa members believe that racist speech is violence and that they must counter it physically, not just oppose it with rhetoric or better ideas.

As the New York Daily News reported, among antifa’s victims were journalists:

Taylor Lorenz of The Hill was punched in the face by an antifa for recording a fight between the two groups; she tweeted that her assaulter told her not to “snitch, media bitch.” A videographer from Richmond’s WTVR covering a counter-protest got a concussion from head blows with a stick.

violence_in_america,Daily Beast,0,http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/09/18/terrorism-the-ugliest-election-x-factor.html,Could a Terror Attack Elect Donald Trump?,2016-09-18,John Avlon,"On the morning of March 11th , 2004 , ten bombs exploded during the morning commute at Madrid ’ s Atocha train station . One hundred and ninety-two people were murdered and over 2,000 injured . Three days later , the government of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar lost power in an election that swung suddenly to the Socialist Party .
The attack , the deadliest in Spain ’ s history , was seen by many as an al-Qaeda-inspired retaliation for the Aznar government ’ s support for the already unpopular U.S. invasion of Iraq . In jihadist lore , this is a legendary success story : a terror attack that inspired enough fear to swing a Western election .
This story has been kicking around the back of my cabeza since Donald Trump won the Republican nomination , and I thought of it again after the explosion Saturday night in Chelsea . Demographic math and a basic failure by the celebrity demagogue to reach out beyond his base makes a general election win unlikely but hardly impossible . Trump can ’ t be counted out until all the votes are counted .
Though he ’ s a uniquely unqualified candidate , I ’ ve been concerned about an outside X-Factor event suddenly changing the emotional calculus of the electorate in ways that we would later regret . This could be a sudden economic collapse or a cyber October-surprise . But terrorism has always seemed the prime known-unknown .
After all , terrorism is now a depressingly regular feature of American life . While no attacks have rivaled 9/11 , we saw at least 45 thwarted terror plots in the first ten years after the destruction of the World Trade Center and in the last year alone suffered horrific losses in the San Bernardino and Orlando slaughters . But we have no template for the impact of an attack just before an American election .
We are in a long war , a “ generational struggle against radical jihadist terrorism , ” as Hillary Clinton has repeatedly said . Many attacks have been the result of lone wolves , darkly inspired rather directed by centralized terror organizations , like the Boston bombing . This risk won ’ t evaporate overnight , no matter who is elected president in less than two months .
Trump has based his campaign on fear and anger of the “ other , ” most infamously pledging to at least temporarily stop Muslim immigration to the United States ( later dialed back to an ambiguous regional restriction ) . Fear of immigration , especially Muslim immigration , has been a mainstay not only of Trump ’ s campaign but also his European dopplegangers in UKIP and Le Pen ’ s National Front Party , which has been buoyed by repeated horrific jihadist attacks from Paris to Nice .
Trump rarely loses an opportunity to exploit terror . Within minutes of initial fog-of-war reports about Saturday night ’ s explosion in Chelsea , Trump told a crowd in Colorado Springs that a bomb had gone off in New York and while “ nobody knows exactly what 's going on but , boy we are really in a time—we better get tough folks . '' Always classy , he then touted a new poll showing him 4-points up .
He has previously tried to make political hay of the San Bernardino and Orlando attacks , with less than successful results . But now we ’ re 50 days from the election and polls show the race is tightening . To some extent , that ’ s to be expected .
But after months of primaries and analytic navel-gazing this is real time , with 29 people injured by an explosion in the heart of New York , just a few blocks from The ███ ’ s headquarters . This came hours after an apparent IED exploded in Seaside , New Jersey , on the site of a U.S. Marine charity race , which had been mercifully delayed , curtailing casualties . There is still much we don ’ t know about both detonations , but New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio ’ s statement calling the Chelsea bomb was “ an intentional act ” but adding “ we do not see a link to terrorism. ” A Saturday night stabbing of eight people at a mall in St . Cloud , Minnesota , by a man in a security guard uniform was claimed by ISIS on Sunday morning , which issued a statement describing the assailant as `` a soldier of the Islamic State . '' This dark trifecta of weekend incidents one week after the anniversary of 9/11 all add to the drumbeat of anxiety which has driven many voters into the arms of Trump , someone they see as a strong man in chaotic times .
More detailed information will come in over the coming hours and days . But there ’ s reason to fear this pattern could continue between now and November . Whether it is the work of lone wolves or something more coordinated , it doesn ’ t take Nostradamus to see that terrorists view President Trump as an asset in their efforts to portray America as discredited and in decline . His divisive instincts play perfectly into ISIS ’ attempts to recast what used to be called The War on Terror as a war between America and Islam everywhere , rather than a rag-tag band of extremists , many radicalized remotely , parading under the broad banner of an apocalyptic death cult .
If this pattern continuing sounds unlikely , consider the fact that America ’ s two biggest geo-political competitors , Russia and China , have been cheering the prospect of a Trump presidency , presumably because they see it as a harbinger of American decline and retreat from the world , despite all the tough guy rhetoric . It ’ s a helpful bit of historical symmetry that “ America First ” has consistently symbolized a flag-waving acquiescence to overseas dictators with bloody expansionist ambitions .
The fact that so many of the Republican Party ’ s national security mandarins have declared Donald Trump unfit for office , should offer a reality check for reflexive Republicans and open-minded independents alike . The latest respected figure to join this chorus was former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates , who wrote in the Wall Street Journal , “ on national security , I believe Mr. Trump is beyond repair . He is stubbornly uninformed about the world and how to lead our country and government , and temperamentally unsuited to lead our men and women in uniform…He is unqualified and unfit to be commander in chief . ''

One hundred and ninety-two people were murdered and over 2,000 injured. Three days later, the government of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar lost power in an election that swung suddenly to the Socialist Party.

The attack, the deadliest in Spain’s history, was seen by many as an al-Qaeda-inspired retaliation for the Aznar government’s support for the already unpopular U.S. invasion of Iraq. In jihadist lore, this is a legendary success story: a terror attack that inspired enough fear to swing a Western election.

This story has been kicking around the back of my cabeza since Donald Trump won the Republican nomination, and I thought of it again after the explosion Saturday night in Chelsea. Demographic math and a basic failure by the celebrity demagogue to reach out beyond his base makes a general election win unlikely but hardly impossible. Trump can’t be counted out until all the votes are counted.

Though he’s a uniquely unqualified candidate, I’ve been concerned about an outside X-Factor event suddenly changing the emotional calculus of the electorate in ways that we would later regret. This could be a sudden economic collapse or a cyber October-surprise. But terrorism has always seemed the prime known-unknown.

After all, terrorism is now a depressingly regular feature of American life. While no attacks have rivaled 9/11, we saw at least 45 thwarted terror plots in the first ten years after the destruction of the World Trade Center and in the last year alone suffered horrific losses in the San Bernardino and Orlando slaughters. But we have no template for the impact of an attack just before an American election.

We are in a long war, a “generational struggle against radical jihadist terrorism,” as Hillary Clinton has repeatedly said. Many attacks have been the result of lone wolves, darkly inspired rather directed by centralized terror organizations, like the Boston bombing. This risk won’t evaporate overnight, no matter who is elected president in less than two months.

Trump has based his campaign on fear and anger of the “other,” most infamously pledging to at least temporarily stop Muslim immigration to the United States (later dialed back to an ambiguous regional restriction). Fear of immigration, especially Muslim immigration, has been a mainstay not only of Trump’s campaign but also his European dopplegangers in UKIP and Le Pen’s National Front Party, which has been buoyed by repeated horrific jihadist attacks from Paris to Nice.

Trump rarely loses an opportunity to exploit terror. Within minutes of initial fog-of-war reports about Saturday night’s explosion in Chelsea, Trump told a crowd in Colorado Springs that a bomb had gone off in New York and while “nobody knows exactly what's going on but, boy we are really in a time—we better get tough folks."" Always classy, he then touted a new poll showing him 4-points up.

He has previously tried to make political hay of the San Bernardino and Orlando attacks, with less than successful results. But now we’re 50 days from the election and polls show the race is tightening. To some extent, that’s to be expected.

But after months of primaries and analytic navel-gazing this is real time, with 29 people injured by an explosion in the heart of New York, just a few blocks from The Daily Beast’s headquarters. This came hours after an apparent IED exploded in Seaside, New Jersey, on the site of a U.S. Marine charity race, which had been mercifully delayed, curtailing casualties. There is still much we don’t know about both detonations, but New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio’s statement calling the Chelsea bomb was “an intentional act” but adding “we do not see a link to terrorism.” A Saturday night stabbing of eight people at a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota, by a man in a security guard uniform was claimed by ISIS on Sunday morning, which issued a statement describing the assailant as ""a soldier of the Islamic State."" This dark trifecta of weekend incidents one week after the anniversary of 9/11 all add to the drumbeat of anxiety which has driven many voters into the arms of Trump, someone they see as a strong man in chaotic times.

More detailed information will come in over the coming hours and days. But there’s reason to fear this pattern could continue between now and November. Whether it is the work of lone wolves or something more coordinated, it doesn’t take Nostradamus to see that terrorists view President Trump as an asset in their efforts to portray America as discredited and in decline. His divisive instincts play perfectly into ISIS’ attempts to recast what used to be called The War on Terror as a war between America and Islam everywhere, rather than a rag-tag band of extremists, many radicalized remotely, parading under the broad banner of an apocalyptic death cult.

If this pattern continuing sounds unlikely, consider the fact that America’s two biggest geo-political competitors, Russia and China, have been cheering the prospect of a Trump presidency, presumably because they see it as a harbinger of American decline and retreat from the world, despite all the tough guy rhetoric. It’s a helpful bit of historical symmetry that “America First” has consistently symbolized a flag-waving acquiescence to overseas dictators with bloody expansionist ambitions.

The fact that so many of the Republican Party’s national security mandarins have declared Donald Trump unfit for office, should offer a reality check for reflexive Republicans and open-minded independents alike. The latest respected figure to join this chorus was former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, who wrote in the Wall Street Journal, “on national security, I believe Mr. Trump is beyond repair. He is stubbornly uninformed about the world and how to lead our country and government, and temperamentally unsuited to lead our men and women in uniform…He is unqualified and unfit to be commander in chief.""

Against this unflattering backdrop, it’s tempting to say that the hawkish former Secretary of States Hillary Clinton could be in a better position to benefit if, God forbid, terror attacks continue through the election. After all, she has a demonstrated record on national security and far more detailed policy proposals on how to deal with ISIS, (which admittedly isn’t hard given Trump’s laughable talk of a “secret plan” to the win the war.)

But sexism impacts negative perceptions of Hillary Clinton just as racism fueled many of the unhinged criticisms of President Obama, especially the Birther conspiracy theories that Trump did so much to pump up over the past five years. We have no national template for a Golda Meir-type leader in our country. There will be many who are susceptible to the idea that an older woman can’t possible be as tough on terrorism as a blustery old man who loves to declare that he’ll “bomb the shit” out of ISIS. ""Strong and wrong"" leaders have real emotional appeal during times of crisis. The certainty of the demagogue can be more compelling than the sober strategies offered by statesmen and stateswomen.

The Antifa graduates collect in the inner cities as they try to climb the career ladders towards the comfortable life promised by their teachers , professors , peers , and parents . This makes it is easy for them to scheme and riot , says the anti-establishment author , Michael Lind , the author of “ The New Class War : Saving Democracy from the Managerial Elite . ”
In an article titled “ Hub City Riot Ninjas : A young overclass gets dressed up to join the burning , ” Lind says :
For the most part , the members of groups like Antifa , the latest incarnation of the violent left , have always been the pampered children of the white overclass . Twenty-somethings who are poor and working class lack the money to buy fancy black ninja outfits and the leisure to spend time plotting in advance of demonstrations . This is nothing new ; as a veteran ’ 60s leftist told me , “ Your Mom and Dad had to have a lot of money for you to take part in the Summer of Love . ”
Their impact is large , in part , because they live alongside each other in the urban centers where their spending power has pushed poor minorities and workers out to distant , ungentrified districts . Lind writes :
The children of the white urban elite—some of them downwardly mobile for life , some of them just going through the underpaid intern phase of professional careers—have colonized rowhouses where workers once lived and have converted former factories and warehouses into settings for la vie bohème . …
Many of today ’ s big city riot ninjas will look back in the future with pride on their nights of prancing around in black leotards and spraypainting “ BLM ” and “ Fuck Trump ” on downtown buildings . A decade from now , the most successful will have well-paying jobs , many of them in the politically progressive sectors like the universities and NGOs . The unlucky ones may still be working at Starbucks—perhaps at the very stores whose plate glass windows they once spray-painted or smashed .
Californian Joel Kotkin says the middle-class is shrinking , and political power is flowing to the business elite and their allied class of cheerleaders in the media and universities :
The new class structure resembles that of Medieval times . At the apex of the new order are two classes—a reborn clerical elite , the clerisy , which dominates the upper part of the professional ranks , universities , media and culture , and a new aristocracy led by tech oligarchs with unprecedented wealth and growing control of information … Below these two classes lies … the yeomanry , which is made up largely of [ middle-class ] small businesspeople , minor property owners , skilled workers and private-sector oriented professionals . Ascendant for much of modern history , this [ yeomanry ] class is in decline while those below them , the new Serfs , grow in numbers—a vast , expanding property-less population .
In this vision , Antifa consists of people who want to get into the “ clerisy. ” But many of them will fail and fall down into the serf class , where they tend bars , deliver food , do piecework journalism .
But these descriptions also mean that Antifa ’ s graduates and Trump ’ s working-class MAGA are potential allies .
The underemployed Antifa college graduates are close cousins to the millions of working-class Americans who rallied to Donald Trump ’ s 2016 message of national solidarity , and “ Buy American , Hire American. ” As Harrington writes in Unherd.com :
Both radical Left and Right are , the authors suggest , “ different segments of the same pool of losers of globalization ” . The left-behind bottom rungs of the new graduate precariat mix cosmopolitan style identity politics with a simmering anger at a system that feels rigged against them , and a demand for economic redistribution … . Meanwhile , adherents of the alt-right face similarly left-behind economic prospects , just without the graduate worldview . So the main mode is the same anger at a rigged system , just overlaid with the mirror-image of the cosmopolitan worldview : nativist identity politics .
Trump ’ s conventional , non-racial demand for national solidarity — Make America Great ! — was the unspoken assumption of all presidential campaigns since the Great Depression in 1929 . But now this call for national solidarity is smeared as “ racist , ” “ xenophobic , ” and “ nativist ” by the clerisy as they trumpet the Tech Elite ’ s demand for global business rules and a global labor market .
The clerisy has done its work well : Antifa ’ s college graduates have been trained to love the imposed diversity and identity politics that make them helpless to stop the outsourcing of their jobs and futures .

WASHINGTON – Before a Wednesday trip to El Paso, Texas, to meet with survivors of a deadly mass shooting, President Donald Trump picked another fight with former Texas congressman and Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke.

While O'Rourke has said Trump should stay away from El Paso because of his past comments about migrants, Trump said in a tweet near midnight that his Democratic foe ""should respect the victims & law enforcement - & be quiet!""

O'Rourke quickly responded with a tweet saying that Trump's rhetoric disqualifies him from talking about a shooting by a man who said his motive was a Hispanic ""invasion"" of the United States.

""22 people in my hometown are dead after an act of terror inspired by your racism,"" said O'Rourke, who represented the city in Congress. ""El Paso will not be quiet and neither will I.""

Trump will travel to El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, on Wednesday to meet with the victims of back-to-back shootings that have reopened a pointed debate over whether his own campaign trail rhetoric has contributed to the violence. The weekend shootings killed at least 31 people.

In his salvo, Trump also mocked O'Rourke's first name – ""phony name to indicate Hispanic heritage"" – as well as his standing in Democratic presidential polls. Trump also took credit for O'Rourke's loss in a 2018 Texas Senate race to incumbent Ted Cruz.

""I trounced him,"" said Trump, who made a campaign trip to Texas on Cruz's behalf.

In another pre-trip tweet, Trump again complained about news coverage surrounding the mass shootings, in this case a flap over how The New York Times changed a headline related to his Monday speech about the attacks.

PABLO , Mont . ( AP ) — Attorney General William Barr announced a nationwide plan Friday to address the crisis of missing and slain Native American women as concerns mount over the level of violence they face .
Barr announced the plan , known as the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons Initiative , during a visit with tribal leaders and law enforcement officials on the Flathead Reservation in Montana .
Native American women experience some of the nation ’ s highest rates of murder , sexual violence and domestic abuse . The National Institute of Justice estimates that 1.5 million Native American women have experienced violence in their lifetime , including many who are victims of sexual violence . On some reservations , federal studies have shown women are killed at a rate more than 10 times the national average .
The Justice Department ’ s new initiative would invest $ 1.5 million to hire specialized coordinators in 11 U.S. attorney ’ s offices across the U.S. with significant Indian Country caseloads . The coordinators would be responsible for developing protocols for a better law enforcement response to missing persons cases .
Montana ’ s coordinator , a former FBI agent , already has started in his position .
Tribal or local law enforcement officials would also be able to call on the FBI for additional help in some missing indigenous persons cases . The FBI could then deploy some of its specialized teams , including investigators who focus on child abduction or evidence collection and special agents who can help do a quick analysis of digital evidence and social media accounts .
The Justice Department also committed to conducting an in-depth analysis of federal databases and its data collection practices to determine if there are ways to improve the gathering of information in missing persons cases .
“ This is not a panacea , ” Barr told tribal council members of the Salish and Kootenai Confederated Tribes at an event where members presented him with a blue blanket before a traditional musical performance . “ This is a step in the right direction , but we have a lot more work to do working together . ”
Barr said he spoke to President Donald Trump about the initiative , which calls for some of the same things already in legislation pending in Congress . He also spoke to tribal leaders about how a surge in methamphetamine use may be influencing violence in Indian Country .
On the nation ’ s largest Native American reservation , tribal members welcomed the extra resources and commitment to the issue but questioned how far the money will go , given how widespread the problem is .
“ This is stuff we ’ ve been advocating for , it ’ s just funding a slice of it , ” said Amber Crotty , a lawmaker on the Navajo Nation .
Crotty pointed out that the hiring of 11 coordinators assigned to federal prosecutor offices nationally as outlined by Barr could have limited value on the Navajo Nation , which is part of three separate U.S. attorney jurisdictions in Arizona , New Mexico and Utah .
She said tribes are looking to the federal government to fund advocates who can greet families of victims , relay information from law enforcement and provide training . She said tribal communities have resorted to organizing their own search parties and posting fliers in communities and on social media when someone goes missing because they sometimes get little or no response from law enforcement .
The extent of the problem of missing and murdered Native American women is difficult to know because of the dysfunction surrounding the issue .
An ███ investigation last year found that nobody knows precisely how many Native American women have gone missing or have been killed nationwide because many cases go unreported , others aren ’ t well documented , and no government database specifically tracks them .
A report released last year by the Urban Indian Health Institute said there were 5,712 cases of missing and murdered indigenous girls in 2016 , but only 116 of those cases were logged in a Justice Department database .
The report by the Seattle nonprofit reflected data from 71 U.S. cities not on tribal land . Researchers said they expect their figures represent an undercount because some police departments in cities with substantial Native American populations — like Albuquerque , New Mexico , and Billings , Montana — didn ’ t respond to records requests or Native Americans were identified as belonging to another race .
Members of Congress asked the U.S. Government Accountability Office in May to review jurisdictional challenges , existing databases , federal policies , law enforcement staffing and notification systems and make recommendations for improvement . The office said Thursday the work is under way .
Bills in Congress seek to address the crisis , and a half-dozen states have vowed to study the problem .
Meanwhile , activists have held rallies at state capitols , marched in the streets , put up memorials and billboards , bought television advertising and created exhibits with space for prayer offerings to draw attention to missing indigenous women .
The movement has featured women with a red hand print over their mouths , in what activists say is a symbol of the silencing of indigenous women .
Curtison Badonie with the New Mexico-based Coalition to Stop Violence Against Native Women said the Justice Department ’ s plan is a positive move in seeking justice for indigenous women and girls , and their grieving families and communities .
“ Finally , they ’ re moving forward with this and they ’ re taking our existence seriously and are listening and knowing our sisters , our aunties , our grandmas , our nieces are important , ” Badonie said . “ They are sacred , they are human beings . We feel hopeful . We feel seen . ”
But Badonie said : “ We want to see that this continues , that this is not going to be just a one-time thing . ”
Tribal police and investigators from the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs generally serve as law enforcement on reservations , which are sovereign nations . But the FBI investigates certain offenses if either the suspect , victim or both are Native American . If there ’ s ample evidence , the Justice Department prosecutes major felonies such as murder , kidnapping and rape if they happen on tribal lands .","Attorney General William Barr, center, shakes hands with Vernon Finley, left, and Tony Incashola, right, after they presented him with a blanket during a Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes council meeting, Friday, Nov. 22, 2019, on the Flathead Reservation in Pablo, Mont.

Syed Farook , 28 , and Tashfeen Malik , 27 , were responsible for the Wednesday morning attack that killed at least 14 people and injured 21 , according to San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan . After initial concerns that there could have been a third shooter , police are now confident there were only two .
Thursday evening , authorities released the names of the 14 victims .
The motives of the shooters remains unclear . But briefings from police reveal an hours-long timeline of events :
Syed Rizwan Farook , an environmental specialist who was born in the U.S. , had worked for the San Bernardino County health department for five years .
Tashfeen Malik , Farook 's wife , was in the U.S. on a K-1 visa and had a Pakistani passport , according to David Bowdich of the FBI 's LA office .
The couple had been married for about two years , says Hussam Ayloush of the Council on American-Islamic Relations .
They had a 6-month-old daughter , whom they left with Farook 's mother on the morning of the attack , Ayloush says .
Ayloush notes that Farook and Malik were both Muslims and their families said they showed no sign of fanaticism . He emphasizes that the attackers ' motives remain unknown .
Neither had a criminal record that police are aware of , Burguan says .
Patrick Baccari worked with Syed Rizwan Farook for two years . He told NPR 's Kelly McEvers that though Farook was quiet , he `` assumed Syed was our friend . ''
`` As I 'm pulling the paper towels from the dispenser there 's explosions , there 's bullets flying through the walls . I look at myself in the mirror and see the blood . I thought somebody booby-trapped the towels dispenser , '' Baccari said .
He and three others stayed in the restroom until officers arrived .
Farook 's brother , Syed Raheel Farook , served in the Navy from 2003 to 2007 , a Navy spokeswoman confirmed to NPR . Syed Raheel Farook completed his service as an information systems technician 3rd class , a junior enlisted sailor , and he was attached to the crew of the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise . Navy records indicate that he made at least one deployment aboard the Enterprise to the Middle East .
The attack began on Wednesday morning , at an office holiday party in the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino . The center provides social services to residents with developmental disabilities , but the shooting was focused on an office party for San Bernardino County staff . Burguan at a press conference late Thursday that 75 to 80 people were in the room .
As a county employee , Farook was at the party . At some point he left in anger , Burguan says .
Both were dressed in `` tactical gear '' ( including load-bearing vests , but not ballistic or bulletproof vests ) and carrying .223-caliber assault-style rifles and semiautomatic handguns , police say .
The weapons used in the shooting were legally purchased , Burguan says : The handguns were purchased by Farook , and authorities are still investigating who purchased the rifles .
Farook and Malik entered the Inland Regional Center and fired between 65 and 75 rifle rounds , Burguan said Thursday .
A bomb — three explosive devices , linked to a remote control car and placed inside a bag — was also discovered at the shooting site , but it failed to go off , Burguan said .
At least 14 people died and 21 were wounded in the initial attack . Emergency response teams rushed to the facility . Approximately 300 officers were part of that response , Burguan said .
Lt. Mike Madden was one of the first responders on the scene . At the press conference late Thursday , he described the `` surreal '' scene . Listen here :
As the search for the suspects began , hundreds of people were evacuated from the Inland Regional Center .
Farook was wearing a ski mask at the time of the shooting , law enforcement officials tell NPR 's Dina Temple-Raston , but witnesses to the shooting still recognized him .
Based on those eyewitness accounts , police drove to nearby Redlands , to a house that had both Farook and Malik 's names on the rental agreement . ( Member station KPCC has a map of the locations involved in the attack . )
Police ca n't confirm whether Farook and Malik lived in the house .
At the house , police encountered Farook and Malik , driving a black Ford SUV . The car was a rental , the police said Thursday .
Farook and Malik drove off in the SUV , and police pursued .
The car chase ended in a shootout . Law enforcement officers fired approximately 380 rounds at the car ; the suspects fired around 76 rounds at the officers .
The suspects had over 1,400 .223-caliber rounds either on their person or in their vehicle , Buergan says , and over 200 9-mm rounds .
Hours after the attack began , the two suspects were dead . Two officers suffered injuries that are not life-threatening .
A third person was taken in custody ; police have determined he was not involved in the shooting and is not a suspect .
The FBI is leading an investigation into the attackers ' motives and planning .
An armored vehicle with a battering ram attached `` very slowly and methodically '' broke down the door of the house in Redlands on Wednesday night , a witness told the LA Times .
Police discovered a stockpile of ammunition and explosives inside the house , Burguan said Thursday , including thousands of rifle and handgun rounds and 12 pipe bombs , with the materials and tools to create more .
Investigators also removed thumb drives , cellphones and other electronic items from the house , Burguan said .
Authorities also continue to examine the site of the shooting at Inland Regional Center and the site of the shootout at the SUV .
All of the agencies involved in the investigation emphasize that they have not identified a motive for the shooting .
The FBI has tasked counterterrorism agents to the case , NPR 's Carrie Johnson reports , but has not yet determined whether the attack was in fact an act of terrorism .
Carrie also says a source tells her Farook had some electronic contact with people overseas who were on the radar of U.S. national security officials , but that investigators are still trying to work out the significance of that contact .
Whatever the motive , Burguan , the San Bernardino police chief , says there does appear to have been some form of planning involved in the attack .
`` I do n't think they just ran home , put on these types of tactical clothes , grabbed guns and came back on a spur-of-the-moment thing , '' he said Wednesday .
President Obama made a statement from the Oval Office on Thursday , noting that it `` may take some time '' for investigators to conduct interviews and sort through the evidence .
He again emphasized that the motive is not yet clear , and said investigators have not ruled out terrorism , a workplace-related shooting or a mixed-motive attack .
`` Rest assured that we will get to the bottom of this , '' he said .
San Bernardino Mayor Carey Davis said in a statement that the attack `` has shaken the core of our community . '' The county suspended all nonessential county services for Thursday and Friday .
Late Wednesday , Farook 's brother-in-law , Farhan Khan , appeared at a press conference with the Council on American-Islamic Relations ( CAIR ) for Greater LA and said he had no idea why Farook would carry out such an attack .
`` I just can not express how sad I am for what happened today , '' he said . He wished victims a speedy recovery and said he was in shock over the shooting , according to member station KPCC .
`` We unequivocally condemn the horrific act that happened today , '' Ayloush , the executive director of the LA CAIR office , said at the same conference , speaking on behalf of the local Muslim community . `` We offer our heartfelt prayers and condolences to the injured , to the families of those who have been killed . ... We stand in mourning , in sadness , for what happened . ''
President Obama , in an interview on CBS on Wednesday night , called for changes to America 's gun control laws , as he has after mass shootings at Newtown , Conn. ; Tucson , Ariz. ; Fort Hood , Texas ; Charleston , S.C. ; and Colorado Springs , Colo. , among others .
On Thursday , he reiterated his calls to make it harder for people to acquire weapons .
And in a press conference Thursday morning , U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said violence like the San Bernardino shooting `` has no place in this country . ''

After initial concerns that there could have been a third shooter, police are now confident there were only two.

Syed Rizwan Farook, an environmental specialist who was born in the U.S., had worked for the San Bernardino County health department for five years.

Tashfeen Malik, Farook's wife, was in the U.S. on a K-1 visa and had a Pakistani passport, according to David Bowdich of the FBI's LA office.

The couple had been married for about two years, says Hussam Ayloush of the Council on American-Islamic Relations.

They had a 6-month-old daughter, whom they left with Farook's mother on the morning of the attack, Ayloush says.

Ayloush notes that Farook and Malik were both Muslims and their families said they showed no sign of fanaticism. He emphasizes that the attackers' motives remain unknown.

Neither had a criminal record that police are aware of, Burguan says.

Patrick Baccari worked with Syed Rizwan Farook for two years. He told NPR's Kelly McEvers that though Farook was quiet, he ""assumed Syed was our friend.""

Baccari was in the bathroom when the shooting began.

""As I'm pulling the paper towels from the dispenser there's explosions, there's bullets flying through the walls. I look at myself in the mirror and see the blood. I thought somebody booby-trapped the towels dispenser,"" Baccari said.

He and three others stayed in the restroom until officers arrived.

Farook's brother, Syed Raheel Farook, served in the Navy from 2003 to 2007, a Navy spokeswoman confirmed to NPR. Syed Raheel Farook completed his service as an information systems technician 3rd class, a junior enlisted sailor, and he was attached to the crew of the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise. Navy records indicate that he made at least one deployment aboard the Enterprise to the Middle East.

The Shooting

The attack began on Wednesday morning, at an office holiday party in the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino. The center provides social services to residents with developmental disabilities, but the shooting was focused on an office party for San Bernardino County staff. Burguan at a press conference late Thursday that 75 to 80 people were in the room.

As a county employee, Farook was at the party. At some point he left in anger, Burguan says.

He returned with Malik.

Both were dressed in ""tactical gear"" (including load-bearing vests, but not ballistic or bulletproof vests) and carrying .223-caliber assault-style rifles and semiautomatic handguns, police say.

The weapons used in the shooting were legally purchased, Burguan says: The handguns were purchased by Farook, and authorities are still investigating who purchased the rifles.

Farook and Malik entered the Inland Regional Center and fired between 65 and 75 rifle rounds, Burguan said Thursday.

A bomb — three explosive devices, linked to a remote control car and placed inside a bag — was also discovered at the shooting site, but it failed to go off, Burguan said.

At least 14 people died and 21 were wounded in the initial attack. Emergency response teams rushed to the facility. Approximately 300 officers were part of that response, Burguan said.

But Farook and Malik were able to escape.

Lt. Mike Madden was one of the first responders on the scene. At the press conference late Thursday, he described the ""surreal"" scene. Listen here:

The Pursuit

As the search for the suspects began, hundreds of people were evacuated from the Inland Regional Center.

Farook was wearing a ski mask at the time of the shooting, law enforcement officials tell NPR's Dina Temple-Raston, but witnesses to the shooting still recognized him.

Based on those eyewitness accounts, police drove to nearby Redlands, to a house that had both Farook and Malik's names on the rental agreement. (Member station KPCC has a map of the locations involved in the attack.)

Police can't confirm whether Farook and Malik lived in the house.

At the house, police encountered Farook and Malik, driving a black Ford SUV. The car was a rental, the police said Thursday.

Farook and Malik drove off in the SUV, and police pursued.

The car chase ended in a shootout. Law enforcement officers fired approximately 380 rounds at the car; the suspects fired around 76 rounds at the officers.

The suspects had over 1,400 .223-caliber rounds either on their person or in their vehicle, Buergan says, and over 200 9-mm rounds.

Hours after the attack began, the two suspects were dead. Two officers suffered injuries that are not life-threatening.

A third person was taken in custody; police have determined he was not involved in the shooting and is not a suspect.

The Investigation

The FBI is leading an investigation into the attackers' motives and planning.

An armored vehicle with a battering ram attached ""very slowly and methodically"" broke down the door of the house in Redlands on Wednesday night, a witness told the LA Times.

Police discovered a stockpile of ammunition and explosives inside the house, Burguan said Thursday, including thousands of rifle and handgun rounds and 12 pipe bombs, with the materials and tools to create more.

Investigators also removed thumb drives, cellphones and other electronic items from the house, Burguan said.

Authorities also continue to examine the site of the shooting at Inland Regional Center and the site of the shootout at the SUV.

All of the agencies involved in the investigation emphasize that they have not identified a motive for the shooting.

The FBI has tasked counterterrorism agents to the case, NPR's Carrie Johnson reports, but has not yet determined whether the attack was in fact an act of terrorism.

Carrie also says a source tells her Farook had some electronic contact with people overseas who were on the radar of U.S. national security officials, but that investigators are still trying to work out the significance of that contact.

Whatever the motive, Burguan, the San Bernardino police chief, says there does appear to have been some form of planning involved in the attack.

""I don't think they just ran home, put on these types of tactical clothes, grabbed guns and came back on a spur-of-the-moment thing,"" he said Wednesday.

President Obama made a statement from the Oval Office on Thursday, noting that it ""may take some time"" for investigators to conduct interviews and sort through the evidence.

He again emphasized that the motive is not yet clear, and said investigators have not ruled out terrorism, a workplace-related shooting or a mixed-motive attack.

""Rest assured that we will get to the bottom of this,"" he said.

The Response

San Bernardino Mayor Carey Davis said in a statement that the attack ""has shaken the core of our community."" The county suspended all nonessential county services for Thursday and Friday.

Late Wednesday, Farook's brother-in-law, Farhan Khan, appeared at a press conference with the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) for Greater LA and said he had no idea why Farook would carry out such an attack.

""I just cannot express how sad I am for what happened today,"" he said. He wished victims a speedy recovery and said he was in shock over the shooting, according to member station KPCC.

""We unequivocally condemn the horrific act that happened today,"" Ayloush, the executive director of the LA CAIR office, said at the same conference, speaking on behalf of the local Muslim community. ""We offer our heartfelt prayers and condolences to the injured, to the families of those who have been killed. ... We stand in mourning, in sadness, for what happened.""

President Obama, in an interview on CBS on Wednesday night, called for changes to America's gun control laws, as he has after mass shootings at Newtown, Conn.; Tucson, Ariz.; Fort Hood, Texas; Charleston, S.C.; and Colorado Springs, Colo., among others.

On Thursday, he reiterated his calls to make it harder for people to acquire weapons.

And in a press conference Thursday morning, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said violence like the San Bernardino shooting ""has no place in this country.""

""This is not what we stand for,"" she said. ""This is not what we live for.""",www.npr.org,center,THTds4vJ5m46IGDU

violence_in_america,Vox,0,http://www.vox.com/2015/7/20/9002747/sandra-bland-arrest-video,Sandra Bland: What we know about her mysterious death in a jail cell,2015-07-20,"German Lopez, Dylan Matthews, Alex Ward, Li Zhou, Hannah Brown, Andrew Prokop","Why would a woman with a promising new job kill herself after she was arrested over an argument for a minor traffic violation ? That 's the question on friends and family members ' minds after police said Sandra Bland , a 28-year-old black woman , killed herself in a Texas jail cell on July 13 .
Months later , on December 21 , a grand jury decided not to indict anyone in her death , but special prosecutor Darrell Jordan said jurors will reconvene in January to discuss other aspects of the case .
The mysterious death came after police pulled Bland over for failing to signal when changing lanes and arrested her , they claim , for allegedly assaulting a cop . Three days later she was found dead in her jail cell , in what officials — citing video evidence and an autopsy report — have called a suicide .
But family , friends , and social media activists do not believe the story . In August , Bland 's family filed a lawsuit pinning her `` wrongful death '' on the Texas trooper who pulled her over and various Texas agencies .
Some of the distrust is based on the circumstances of Bland 's death — but , more broadly , the skepticism shows some of the wider distrust built up toward law enforcement over the past year of protests against police brutality .
Bland was pulled over for not signaling when changing lanes
Bland , a Chicago native , went to Texas to take a job as a student ambassador to the alumni association at Prairie View A & M University , a historically black university from which she graduated in 2009 .
On July 10 , a Texas trooper , Brian Encinia , pulled over Bland for allegedly failing to signal while changing lanes . A dashboard camera from the police car recorded the stop .
The video shows the stop was calm at first , but it escalated once the trooper asked Bland to put out a cigarette . Bland asked , `` I 'm in my car . Why do I have to put out my cigarette ? '' The trooper responded by asking her to get out of the car . When Bland did n't comply , Encinia opened her car door and attempted to pull her out . When that did n't work , Encinia pulled out his stun gun , aimed it at Bland , and said , `` I will light you up . '' At that point , Bland got out of the car .
The videos never show Bland attacking Encinia , although it may have happened off-camera
Encinia then arrested Bland off-camera . Bland can be heard insulting Encinia , and complaining that he was treating her roughly . Encinia said — again , off-camera — that Bland was resisting arrest . A female trooper apparently joins Encinia sometime during the arrest , and helps him .
`` You just slammed me , knocked my head to the ground , '' Bland told Encinia . `` I got epilepsy , you motherfucker . ''
Encinia can be heard telling another trooper in the video that Bland `` started yanking away , then kicked me , so I took her straight to the ground . '' The dashcam video and another video of the arrest taken by a bystander never show Bland attacking Encinia , although it may have happened off-camera .
Investigators , whom the FBI is now aiding , found the trooper who pulled over Bland `` violated the department 's procedures regarding traffic stops and the department 's courtesy policy . '' Authorities did n't provide additional details , including what policy the trooper violated .
Bland died in her jail cell , and police said it 's a suicide
After the arrest , Bland was taken to the Waller County jail , allegedly for assaulting Encinia . She was found dead in her jail cell on July 13 . Officials claim the death was suicide by hanging with a plastic bag .
The Harris County medical examiner claimed Bland 's death was a suicide in an initial autopsy report , finding signs of a hanging and cutting scars but not the types of injuries that would suggest a violent struggle prior to a murder .
The lawyer for Bland 's family told MSNBC 's Lawrence O'Donnell that Texas officials had deemed the autopsy defective , and that officials wanted to conduct another autopsy . But Waller County District Attorney Elton Mathis told Chicago-based WGN-TV that officials only wanted to run more tests to see if Bland had swallowed a large amount of marijuana before her death .
County investigators are looking into the death as thoroughly `` as it would be in a murder investigation , '' Mathis said at a news conference , according to the Associated Press 's Michael Graczyk . `` It is very much too early to make any kind of determination that this was a suicide or a murder because the investigations are not complete , '' Mathis said , later adding that the case will go to a grand jury .
On July 27 , Mathis announced that a special , independent committee will oversee the investigation into Bland 's arrest and death . The group will be headed by Lewis White and Darrell Jordan , both of whom are criminal defense attorneys and have previous experience as prosecutors , the Houston Chronicle 's Leah Binkovitz reported .
In a recent Facebook post , Bland said she was dealing with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder
Bland may have had a troubled history . In a recent Facebook post , Bland said she was dealing with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder . And she told jailers that she previously attempted suicide with pills after she lost a baby , according to booking documents .
Video released by local officials also shows a period of 90 minutes in which no one appears to go in or out of Bland 's cell prior to her death . But the footage does n't show the inside of Bland 's cell or her cell door . Officials turned over hard drives of the footage to the FBI to determine if there are signs of manipulation , Brian Cantrell , head of the sheriff 's department criminal investigation division , said at a press conference .
Still , family and friends said Bland was doing well . `` I talked to her Friday [ July 10 ] , and she was in good spirits , '' LaVaughn Mosley , Bland 's friend , told KHOU-TV 's Alice Barr . `` Although she was incarcerated , she was in good spirits . She was looking forward to posting bond Saturday and getting out . So you do n't go from that to hanging yourself . ''
The region also has a history of racial tensions . In 2008 , Sheriff Glenn Smith was fired from his job as police chief in Hempstead , which is in Waller County , by the city council after accusations of police misconduct against African Americans , according to the Houston Chronicle 's Eric Hanson . Smith said the termination was politically motivated .
Bland 's family 's testimony , prior accusations of racism against the Waller County sheriff , and investigators ' findings about the traffic stop have fueled skepticism about the case , leading the family to demand an independent autopsy , and a Change.org petition asking for the Department of Justice to step in . But even if Bland 's death was a suicide , there 's mounting evidence that the jail still failed her .
The Waller County jail failed to enforce several policies meant to prevent suicides
There 's still much debate about whether Bland 's death was a suicide . But we do know that the jail failed at several points to evaluate Bland 's mental health , and suicides in local jails are common and often difficult to explain .
In Bland 's case , the jail appeared to violate several policies . According to the Waller County sheriff 's office , jailers did n't receive two hours of mental health training in the past year , and they did n't complete a visual face-to-face observation of Bland for more than 60 minutes . And the Texas jail oversight commission found that the jail should have conducted — but did n't — a court-ordered mental health exam once Bland indicated she tried to kill herself before , the Texas Tribune 's Terri Langford reported .
That 's particularly concerning because the suicide rate in local jails is nearly 3.7 times the national rate . In 2013 , the rate in local jails was 46 per 100,000 inmates , according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics . But the rate among the US population was 12.6 per 100,000 people , according to the American Foundation of Suicide Prevention .
The high suicide rate in part reflects who 's typically in jail , Nancy La Vigne , director of the Urban Institute 's Justice Policy Center , explained . Incarcerated populations tend to have a much higher rate of mental health issues — diagnosed and undiagnosed — that can lead to suicide . `` They 're detained , conceivably , as a threat to themselves or others , '' she said . `` A lot of police officers do n't know of , are n't aware of , or perceive a lack of accessibility to resources or places in the community where they can take people who are not criminals per se but are disruptive and combative based on their mental illness . And instead they take people to jail because that 's the easy thing to do . ''
But in some cases , people kill themselves in jail without a history of mental health issues , even sometimes when they 're being held on minor charges . Why would jailed people kill themselves in this kind of situation ? The Washington Post 's Radley Balko talked to Lindsay Hayes , project director of the National Center on Institutions and Alternatives , to find out :
The mere trauma of sitting in a jail cell can be overwhelming , and this is particularly true for someone who has never been in one before . And that could explain the suicides by people who are n't facing serious charges . `` That it was an arrest for a minor crime may not matter . In fact a sense of injustice can only add to the emotional damage . Someone may be sitting in a cell for longer than they were supposed to be . So the walls start closing in . There 's the uncertainty , of not knowing when you 're going to get out . There 's the loss of control . You 're cut off from family and friends . And it 's all beyond your control . That can be really difficult , especially for someone who has n't experienced it before . ''
To address the high suicide rates , experts say jails could adopt better intake screening , better monitoring , and better access to mental health professionals . But many jails do n't have the right policies or , when they do , take the measures seriously enough .
`` There are certainly going to be cases in which a suicide is a complete mystery , where there were no risks present , '' Hayes told Balko , referring to jail suicides in general . `` But most of the time , these suicides could have been prevented . If you peel back the onion , you usually find that there was unmentioned information that should have been discovered . ''
Still , the Waller County jail 's failures and high rate of suicides in correctional facilities does n't explain all of the anger and distrust surrounding Bland 's case . For many , the issues go much further — rooted in a much deeper discontent with racial disparities in the criminal justice system .
Since the deaths of black men like Freddie Gray in Baltimore , Eric Garner in New York City , and Michael Brown in Ferguson , Missouri , racial disparities in police use of force and the criminal justice system in general have received heightened attention . And in some cases — such as the police shooting of Walter Scott in North Charleston , South Carolina — the initial police account greatly conflicted with what video footage later proved happened , fostering even more distrust in the police .
These concerns are n't necessarily new in black communities , which have complained about mistreatment by police for decades . But the high-profile police killings have brought mainstream media attention to the issue .
For example , black people were roughly 31 percent more likely to be pulled over than their white counterparts in 2011 , according to a 2013 analysis by the Bureau of Justice Statistics . About 12.8 percent of black drivers were reportedly pulled over , compared with 9.8 percent of white drivers and 10.4 percent of Hispanic drivers .
This is only one of many examples of racial disparities in the criminal justice system . In the past year , much of the scrutiny of police has focused on disproportionate use of force and arrests :","Why would a woman with a promising new job kill herself after she was arrested over an argument for a minor traffic violation?

A video is making the rounds on the Internet that appears to show the Ferguson, Mo., police officer who killed an unarmed black teen in August in an altercation with a man who allegedly had derelict vehicles on his property.

In the 15-second video posted to YouTube, a police officer who appears to be Darren Wilson is telling a man he must stop filming video. Various news reports indicate the man is named Michael Arman and he was involved in an Oct. 28, 2013, exchange with Wilson. A grand jury is reviewing murder charges against Wilson in the fatal shooting of Michael Brown.

Dialogue on the video is as follows:

Man behind the camera: ""What's your name, sir?""

Police officer: ""If you wanna take a picture of me one more time, I'm gonna lock your ... up.""

Man filming: ""Sir, I'm not taking a picture, I'm recording this incident. Do I not have the right to record?""

The officer then begins walking toward the person who is filming.

Police officer: ""No you don't. Come on.""

FERGUSON:Racial gap in U.S. arrest rates reflect large disparity

The video was posted to YouTube last Friday and as of 9:30 p.m. ET on Tuesday, had received more than 327,000 views. It was posted by someone with the YouTube identity ""milk bone,"" who wrote along with the posting, ""Officer Darren Wilson of the Ferguson police department violates my 1st constitutional amendment.

According to a Ferguson Police Department arrest report filed by Wilson and available online, Wilson wrote that he found several derelict vehicles on the property and asked Michael Arman about them.

Wilson wrote that Arman announced he would record the exchange and Wilson wrote that he told Arman that an audio recording would be fine. Arman proceeded to record video with his cellphone and refused to answer questions or cooperate, Wilson wrote.

Another for a man who crashed , drunk , into a liquor store . Another for a man charged with killing a teen in a joy ride that went wrong .
But the authorities are not searching for any of those fugitives , and even if they happen to find them , they will not pursue them beyond the county line .
Across the United States , a ███ investigation has found , police routinely allow as many as half of the people wanted for crimes large and small to escape justice simply by venturing a few miles from where they are wanted . In the Las Vegas area alone , police records list more than 408,000 arrest warrants for fugitives who wo n't be pursued beyond the edges of Clark County .
And although most of the fugitives face minor charges , law enforcement records in Nevada and other states list thousands of fugitives wanted for domestic violence , sexual abuse , manslaughter and repeat drunken driving who can evade arrest simply by traveling a county or two away . In New York , records list six rape suspects police wo n't pursue beyond a neighboring county .
Police say they have little choice but to let them go . `` It really does come down to cost , '' says Jack Manning , the head of a small police force responsible for tracking down people wanted by Las Vegas ' municipal court . He said he could not recall the last time his officers traveled outside Clark County to retrieve a suspect .
███ found earlier this year that law enforcement agencies across the country would let more than 186,000 felony suspects escape justice if they turned up in a different state , including thousands of fugitives wanted for robbery , sexual assault and even murder . Police and prosecutors said they lacked the time and money to navigate the occasionally cumbersome process , known as extradition , for retrieving fugitives from another state .
Records suggest that well over a million fugitives need not travel even that far to get away .
In three states alone , confidential law enforcement databases list nearly a million fugitives who need not fear being arrested if they 're found beyond the next county , let alone in the next state .
Irma Delgadillo 's reaction was common when she found out exactly how far the police were willing to go to pursue the man charged with killing her son : `` Wow . ''
Her son , Giovanni Saavedra , was 17 on the night in November 2007 when he jokingly jumped onto the covered bed of his friend 's pickup . The two had been laughing about what would happen if his friend started driving with Giovanni still atop the slick , plastic cover .
A moment later , Giovanni 's friend did just that , according to police reports . He backed out of the driveway of the teen 's North Las Vegas home and headed around the block . He turned one corner , then another , headed back toward Giovanni 's house . Another man riding in the truck 's cab said the second turn was `` too sharp '' and that the driver `` lost control of the truck . ''
The sharp turn flung Giovanni from the truck 's bed ; he landed on the pavement beside a gravel-strewn city park , cracking his skull in four places . When paramedics reached him , he was lying on his back , bleeding from his mouth .
Giovanni was already connected to a ventilator by the time the police summoned his mother from the casino where she worked as a waitress . She heard what happened secondhand , from police officers and witnesses . Neighbors , she recalled , `` said my son was screaming his lungs out and saying , 'Stop , stop . ' ``
Three days later , Giovanni showed no signs of progress . A doctor told Delgadillo that there was no hope of recovery , that `` his brain would just start dissolving . '' That afternoon , gathered with Giovanni 's brother and two sisters in his hospital room , she authorized doctors to disconnect the ventilator . He died that afternoon .
Police charged Giovanni 's friend , Edgardo Martinez-Tapia , with manslaughter . They had sought to charge him with a felony , but prosecutors instead said he could be charged only with violating a Nevada law that makes it a misdemeanor to kill someone while disobeying traffic laws . A North Las Vegas judge issued a warrant for Martinez-Tapia 's arrest , and officials logged it into a statewide database of fugitives .
Those databases are among the main ways police catch fugitives . Every time police stop someone for speeding or book them into jail , they can find out within seconds whether the person is already wanted , and for what . The databases also indicate how far the agency is willing to travel to pick up the person .
For Martinez-Tapia , officials said they would go only as far as the county line . That means if he is stopped by the police anyplace else , authorities would not go get him .
███ was unable to locate Martinez-Tapia . North Las Vegas officials did not respond to questions about why they would not go farther to pursue him .
Delgadillo , Giovanni 's anguished mother , wonders : `` Why did n't they put him away ? ''
Those unwanted fugitives underscore an often overlooked reality for U.S. law enforcement : For all the advances police and prosecutors have made in their ability to solve crimes , they still struggle with the basic step of making sure that the people they arrest show up to answer the charges .
Exactly how often police decide not to pursue suspects even within their states is impossible to know . Some states do n't systematically track the limits their officers put on warrants . In others , officials said warrant records are secret .
Still , police records and databases from across the United States make clear that it happens routinely :
• In Michigan : Half of the roughly 1 million people with outstanding arrest warrants would be picked up only if police found them within 25 miles of the city where they 're wanted , according to the Michigan State Police . Among them are approximately 1,000 people charged with felonies .
• In New York : Nearly half of the state 's fugitives would be arrested only if police found them in New York City or its immediate suburbs . Among them are at least 361 people charged with sexual abuse and more than 11,000 people charged with assault .
• In Nevada : Among the 408,000 arrest warrants Las Vegas area police and court officials have decided to serve only within the county are nearly 6,500 for people charged with either assault or battery . Nearly 300 others are for people charged with drunken driving for at least the second time .
`` I do n't think that 's a good idea , but it all probably comes down to dollars , '' says Kathleen Bienenstein , the program coordinator for Mothers Against Drunk Driving 's Nevada chapter . `` When you have repeat offenders and people who think it 's a joke , that 's a problem . ''
Even some police officials said they were surprised Las Vegas-area authorities would n't pursue some fugitives at least as far as the state border — particularly those charged with drunken driving or manslaughter . `` We 're hopefully more responsible than that , '' said Tori Shumway , who manages a Nevada Highway Patrol warrant unit .
Brandon McManaway is wanted on charges that he grabbed his girlfriend by the neck during a Christmas Eve argument in 2009 , then punched her in the face four times with a closed fist .
Reached at a community correction center outside Columbus , Ohio , where he is serving a sentence for an unrelated drug charge , McManaway denied hitting her . He said he did not know that he was wanted in Las Vegas and asked what the charge was .
`` I 'm not worried about that , '' he said when he heard . `` They wo n't come get me for that . ''
In Las Vegas , as in many cities , police can barely afford to keep up with fugitives who do n't run .
The police force responsible for tracking down people wanted in Las Vegas ' city court , for example , has just 20 officers to serve more than 117,000 outstanding warrants — when they 're not busy providing security inside the courtrooms .
Instead , police count on suspects to eventually get tired of the routine inconveniences of being wanted and to turn themselves in . Nevada , for example , wo n't issue a driver 's license to someone with an outstanding warrant . And pending criminal charges , even minor ones , can derail job applications if they turn up during background checks .
`` One way or another , most people are going to be held accountable . It 's just a matter of time , '' Manning said .
Other states take a different approach . In Massachusetts and North Carolina , for example , arrest warrants generally are good anywhere in the state , and officers who find a fugitive can simply take him to a local judge instead of having to find someone to ferry him to the other side of the state .
`` If I knew as a criminal that someone will only go 25 miles to get me , what would prevent me from driving 26 miles to the next jurisdiction ? '' said Hickory , N.C. , Police Chief Tom Adkins . `` Our citizens would expect that if we start a criminal process , that ( the warrant ) is served . ''
But authorities say it 's common that police do not have the time or money to pursue people wanted for minor offenses .
`` I would think that in every town , city and hamlet across the country there are thousands of in-county warrants for minor offenses , '' said Scott Burns , until recently the head of the National District Attorneys Association . `` That probably has broad support among the taxpayers ; why should we expend the time and money to go find these people ? ''
He said authorities should use their limited resources to focus on people who might pose a danger to others .
But in Las Vegas and elsewhere , law enforcement wo n't pursue even some people charged with violent offenses . Jennifer Bueler , for example , faces two separate battery charges .
One afternoon in 2011 , police charged , Bueler shoved her mother into a wall as they tussled over $ 32 . Another night , police said , she pushed her mother down a flight of stairs as they fought over $ 80 . Bueler 's mother told a police officer she feared her daughter would try to kill her . `` I looked up at her eyes , and they were just total blackness , '' Bueler 's mother , Sharon Bueler , said later .
Jennifer Bueler is in prison in Arizona on an unrelated charge . Sharon Bueler says she does n't want to see her daughter freed there only to be dragged back to Nevada to face battery charges .
Her daughter 's lawyer , Julian Gregory , says there 's little chance of that . The two warrants for Bueler , like nearly all of those issued by the city 's municipal court , are for pickup in Clark County only .
`` Defendants have this perception that I can bounce and nobody 's ever going to come find me , '' he said .","Brad Heath

LAS VEGAS — Their arrest warrants pile up by the thousands: One for a man accused of punching his girlfriend in the face. Another for a man who crashed, drunk, into a liquor store. Another for a man charged with killing a teen in a joy ride that went wrong.

But the authorities are not searching for any of those fugitives, and even if they happen to find them, they will not pursue them beyond the county line.

USA TODAY found earlier this year that law enforcement agencies across the country would let more than 186,000 felony suspects escape justice if they turned up in a different state, including thousands of fugitives wanted for robbery, sexual assault and even murder. Police and prosecutors said they lacked the time and money to navigate the occasionally cumbersome process, known as extradition, for retrieving fugitives from another state.

Records suggest that well over a million fugitives need not travel even that far to get away.

In three states alone, confidential law enforcement databases list nearly a million fugitives who need not fear being arrested if they're found beyond the next county, let alone in the next state.

Irma Delgadillo's reaction was common when she found out exactly how far the police were willing to go to pursue the man charged with killing her son: ""Wow.""

Her son, Giovanni Saavedra, was 17 on the night in November 2007 when he jokingly jumped onto the covered bed of his friend's pickup. The two had been laughing about what would happen if his friend started driving with Giovanni still atop the slick, plastic cover.

A jury found him not guilty of second-degree murder late Saturday night and declined to convict him on a lesser charge of manslaughter.However , with many critics angry over his acquittal , his freedom will likely be limited.Demonstrators upset with the verdict protested mostly peacefully in Florida and Atlanta overnight , but some broke windows and vandalized a police squad car in Oakland during protests in four California cities , authorities said . `` He 's going to be looking over his shoulder the rest of his life , '' Robert Zimmerman Jr. said during an interview on CNN.Martin 's killing in February 2012 unleashed furious debate across the U.S. over racial profiling , self-defense and equal justice . Protesters across the country lashed out against police in the Orlando suburb of Sanford , outraged that it took 44 days for Zimmerman to be arrested . Many , including Martin 's parents , claimed Zimmerman had racially profiled the unarmed black teen . Zimmerman identifies himself as Hispanic.Six anonymous female jurors - all but one of them white - considered nearly three weeks of often wildly conflicting testimony over who was the aggressor on the rainy night the 17-year-old was shot while walking through the gated townhouse community where he was staying and where Zimmerman lived.They deliberated more than 15 hours over two days before announcing late Saturday night that they had reached a verdict.Defense attorney Mark O'Mara said in August 2012 that Zimmerman and his wife , Shellie , had been living `` like a hermit '' and were not working because they feared for their safety.After Saturday 's verdict , police , officials and civil rights leaders urged peace and told protesters not to resort to violence . While defense attorneys said they were thrilled with the outcome , O'Mara suggested Zimmerman 's safety would be an ongoing concern . `` There still is a fringe element that wants revenge , '' O'Mara said . `` They wo n't listen to a verdict of not guilty . `` Those watching reacted strongly when the verdict was announced . Martin 's mother and father were not in the courtroom when it was read ; supporters of his family who had gathered outside yelled `` No ! No ! '' upon learning of the verdict.Andrew Perkins , 55 , a black resident of Sanford , angrily asked outside the courthouse : `` How the hell did they find him not guilty ? `` `` He killed somebody and got away with murder , '' Perkins shouted , so angry he shook , looking toward the courthouse.Trayvon Martin 's brother , Jahvaris Fulton , said simply on Twitter : `` Et tu America ? '' - a reference to the Latin phrase `` Et tu , Brute ? '' known as an expression of betrayal.Protesters had taken to the streets late Saturday and into Sunday morning in Florida and other states , largely heeding the advice of officials and others who urged them not to resort to violence.Authorities said in California media reports that some marchers in Oakland vandalized a police squad car and police formed a line to block some demonstrators there . TV news helicopter footage showed some people trying to start fires in the street and spray painting anti-police graffiti . The demonstration followed a raucous but largely peaceful protest in San Francisco and another in Los Angeles . An Oakland police dispatch said about 100 people protested there , but gave no word of any arrestsCelebrities also reacted . Beyonce called at a Nashville concert for a moment of silence for Martin . Elsewhere , rapper Young Jeezy released a song in Martin 's memory and Russell Simmons called for a peace.Martin family attorney Benjamin Crump acknowledged the disappointment of Trayvon Martin 's supporters , ranking the teen alongside civil rights heroes Medgar Evers and Emmett Till in the history of the fight for equal justice . However , he said , `` for Trayvon to rest in peace , we must all be peaceful . `` Martin 's family maintained the teen was not the aggressor , and prosecutors suggested Martin was scared because he was being followed by a stranger . Defense attorneys , however , claimed Martin knocked Zimmerman down and was slamming the older man 's head against the concrete sidewalk when Zimmerman fired his gun.Prosecutors called Zimmerman a liar and portrayed him as a `` wannabe cop '' vigilante who had grown frustrated by break-ins in his neighborhood committed primarily by young black men . Zimmerman assumed Martin was up to no good and took the law into his own hands , prosecutors said.State Attorney Angela Corey said after the verdict that she believed second-degree murder was the appropriate charge because Zimmerman 's mindset `` fit the bill of second-degree murder . `` `` We charged what we believed we could prove , '' Corey said.Zimmerman also had some supporters outside the courthouse , including Cindy Lenzen , 50 , of Casslebury , and her brother , 52-year-old Chris Bay , who stood watching others chant slogans such as , `` the whole system 's guilty . `` Lenzen and Bay - who are white - called the entire case `` a tragedy , '' especially for Zimmerman . `` It 's a tragedy that he 's going to suffer for the rest of his life , '' Bay said . `` No one wins either way . This is going to be a recurring nightmare in his mind every night . `` Before a special prosecutor assigned to the case ordered Zimmerman 's arrest , thousands of protesters had gathered in Sanford , Miami , New York and elsewhere , many wearing hoodies like the one Martin had on the night he died . They also carried Skittles and a can of iced tea , items Martin had in his pocket . President Barack Obama weighed in , saying that if he had a son , `` he 'd look like Trayvon . `` Despite the racially charged nature of the case , race was barely mentioned at the trial . `` This case has never been about race or the right to bear arms , '' Corey said . `` We believe this case all along was about boundaries , and George Zimmerman exceeded those boundaries . `` One of the few mentions of race came from witness Rachel Jeantel , the Miami teen who was talking to Martin by phone moments before he was shot . She testified that he described being followed by a `` creepy-ass cracker '' as he walked through the neighborhood.Jeantel gave some of the trial 's most riveting testimony . She said she overheard Martin demand , `` What are you following me for ? '' and then yell , `` Get off ! Get off ! '' before his cellphone went dead.The jurors had to sort out clashing testimony from 56 witnesses in all , including police , neighbors , friends and family members.For example , witnesses who got fleeting glimpses of the fight in the darkness gave differing accounts of who was on top . And Martin 's parents and Zimmerman 's parents both claimed that the person heard screaming for help in the background of a neighbor 's 911 call was their son . Zimmerman had cuts and scrapes on his face and the back of his head , but prosecutors suggested the injuries were not serious.To secure a second-degree murder conviction , prosecutors had to convince the jury that Zimmerman acted with a `` depraved '' state of mind - that is , with ill will , hatred or spite.To win a manslaughter conviction , prosecutors had to convince the jury only that Zimmerman killed without lawful justification .","Editor's Note:

Many, including Martin's parents, claimed Zimmerman had racially profiled the unarmed black teen. Zimmerman identifies himself as Hispanic.Six anonymous female jurors - all but one of them white - considered nearly three weeks of often wildly conflicting testimony over who was the aggressor on the rainy night the 17-year-old was shot while walking through the gated townhouse community where he was staying and where Zimmerman lived.They deliberated more than 15 hours over two days before announcing late Saturday night that they had reached a verdict.Defense attorney Mark O'Mara said in August 2012 that Zimmerman and his wife, Shellie, had been living ""like a hermit"" and were not working because they feared for their safety.After Saturday's verdict, police, officials and civil rights leaders urged peace and told protesters not to resort to violence. While defense attorneys said they were thrilled with the outcome, O'Mara suggested Zimmerman's safety would be an ongoing concern.""There still is a fringe element that wants revenge,"" O'Mara said. ""They won't listen to a verdict of not guilty.""Those watching reacted strongly when the verdict was announced. Martin's mother and father were not in the courtroom when it was read; supporters of his family who had gathered outside yelled ""No! No!"" upon learning of the verdict.Andrew Perkins, 55, a black resident of Sanford, angrily asked outside the courthouse: ""How the hell did they find him not guilty?""""He killed somebody and got away with murder,"" Perkins shouted, so angry he shook, looking toward the courthouse.Trayvon Martin's brother, Jahvaris Fulton, said simply on Twitter: ""Et tu America?"" - a reference to the Latin phrase ""Et tu, Brute?"" known as an expression of betrayal.Protesters had taken to the streets late Saturday and into Sunday morning in Florida and other states, largely heeding the advice of officials and others who urged them not to resort to violence.Authorities said in California media reports that some marchers in Oakland vandalized a police squad car and police formed a line to block some demonstrators there. TV news helicopter footage showed some people trying to start fires in the street and spray painting anti-police graffiti. The demonstration followed a raucous but largely peaceful protest in San Francisco and another in Los Angeles. An Oakland police dispatch said about 100 people protested there, but gave no word of any arrestsCelebrities also reacted. Beyonce called at a Nashville concert for a moment of silence for Martin. Elsewhere, rapper Young Jeezy released a song in Martin's memory and Russell Simmons called for a peace.Martin family attorney Benjamin Crump acknowledged the disappointment of Trayvon Martin's supporters, ranking the teen alongside civil rights heroes Medgar Evers and Emmett Till in the history of the fight for equal justice. However, he said, ""for Trayvon to rest in peace, we must all be peaceful.""Martin's family maintained the teen was not the aggressor, and prosecutors suggested Martin was scared because he was being followed by a stranger. Defense attorneys, however, claimed Martin knocked Zimmerman down and was slamming the older man's head against the concrete sidewalk when Zimmerman fired his gun.Prosecutors called Zimmerman a liar and portrayed him as a ""wannabe cop"" vigilante who had grown frustrated by break-ins in his neighborhood committed primarily by young black men. Zimmerman assumed Martin was up to no good and took the law into his own hands, prosecutors said.State Attorney Angela Corey said after the verdict that she believed second-degree murder was the appropriate charge because Zimmerman's mindset ""fit the bill of second-degree murder.""""We charged what we believed we could prove,"" Corey said.Zimmerman also had some supporters outside the courthouse, including Cindy Lenzen, 50, of Casslebury, and her brother, 52-year-old Chris Bay, who stood watching others chant slogans such as, ""the whole system's guilty.""Lenzen and Bay - who are white - called the entire case ""a tragedy,"" especially for Zimmerman.""It's a tragedy that he's going to suffer for the rest of his life,"" Bay said. ""No one wins either way. This is going to be a recurring nightmare in his mind every night.""Before a special prosecutor assigned to the case ordered Zimmerman's arrest, thousands of protesters had gathered in Sanford, Miami, New York and elsewhere, many wearing hoodies like the one Martin had on the night he died. They also carried Skittles and a can of iced tea, items Martin had in his pocket. President Barack Obama weighed in, saying that if he had a son, ""he'd look like Trayvon.""Despite the racially charged nature of the case, race was barely mentioned at the trial.""This case has never been about race or the right to bear arms,"" Corey said. ""We believe this case all along was about boundaries, and George Zimmerman exceeded those boundaries.""One of the few mentions of race came from witness Rachel Jeantel, the Miami teen who was talking to Martin by phone moments before he was shot. She testified that he described being followed by a ""creepy-ass cracker"" as he walked through the neighborhood.Jeantel gave some of the trial's most riveting testimony. She said she overheard Martin demand, ""What are you following me for?"" and then yell, ""Get off! Get off!"" before his cellphone went dead.The jurors had to sort out clashing testimony from 56 witnesses in all, including police, neighbors, friends and family members.For example, witnesses who got fleeting glimpses of the fight in the darkness gave differing accounts of who was on top. And Martin's parents and Zimmerman's parents both claimed that the person heard screaming for help in the background of a neighbor's 911 call was their son. Zimmerman had cuts and scrapes on his face and the back of his head, but prosecutors suggested the injuries were not serious.To secure a second-degree murder conviction, prosecutors had to convince the jury that Zimmerman acted with a ""depraved"" state of mind - that is, with ill will, hatred or spite.To win a manslaughter conviction, prosecutors had to convince the jury only that Zimmerman killed without lawful justification.",www.newsmax.com,right,WtZ4LGW8odtPl82d

Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., on ""Fox News Sunday,"" called for a ""national commission"" looking at ""violence and the entertainment culture"" -- at video games, at movies, and asking whether they are causing ""vulnerable young men, particularly, to be more violent.""

Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., endorsed the idea.

Durbin, though, was also among those calling for new scrutiny of America's gun policy.

While typically those calls are muted in the immediate aftermath of such a tragedy, the fact that most of the victims were children appeared to drive the eagerness among those in Washington to shift to the policy debate as soon as possible.

The election behind him, Obama on Friday called for ""meaningful action.""

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Monday that the issue will require a ""comprehensive solution"" involving gun control and other measures.

What form that action could take remains to be seen. Democratic lawmakers have already gravitated toward a few specific proposals.

On the more sweeping end, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said Sunday she will introduce on the first day of the next session a de facto renewal of the assault-weapons ban that expired in 2004. She said the bill would also ban high-capacity clips.

The gunmen reportedly drove up to the event , a `` Muhammad Art Exhibit and Cartoon Contest , '' some time before 7 p.m. at the Curtis Culwell Center , a public event space run by the local school district . The two men opened fire on the event , wounding an unarmed security guard in the ankle , before being shot and killed by police , who were already nearby providing security .
The Associated Press reports that the bomb squad was called in to search the gunmen 's bodies and their car for explosives . `` Because of the situation of what was going on today and the history of what we 've been told has happened at other events like this , we are considering their car [ is ] possibly containing a bomb , '' Officer Joe Harn , a spokesman for the Garland Police Department , said at a news conference .
The gunmen have not yet been identified , and police say there were no credible threats made ahead of the event .
But the attack has already stirred comparisons to the deadly attack in Paris on the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo , in which brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi killed 12 people , including several of the magazine 's cartoonists , over its frequent depictions of the prophet Muhammad .
Indeed , yesterday 's event was a direct response to one held on the same site in late January called `` Stand with the Prophet . '' The Dallas Morning News reports that that January event spurred the American Freedom Defense Initiative ( AFDI ) , a group led by prominent anti-Islam activist Pam Geller , to organize the cartoon contest at the same location . The AFDI is considered an extremist group by the Southern Poverty Law Center , which tracks extremist and hate organizations .
The event was attended Ms. Geller , who described it as an exercise of free speech , as well as prominent far-right politician Geert Wilders , head of the Dutch Freedom Party . Mr. Wilders reportedly gave the keynote speech , in which he similarly depicted anti-Muhammad imagery as a matter of free speech . `` Muhammad fought and terrorized people with the swords . Today , here in Garland , we fight Muhammad and his followers with the pen . And the pen , the drawings , will prove mightier than the sword , '' he said .

It was JP that organized the first Muhammad cartoons , as `` part of the provocative local anti-Muslim campaign sweeping Denmark , not a statement about free speech . ''","Two gunmen were killed in an attack on a cartoon contest to draw the prophet Muhammad in Garland, Texas, Sunday night – an incident and event that has invoked both January's Charlie Hebdo attacks and the anti-Muslim cartoons from Europe that sparked the controversy over Hebdo.

The gunmen reportedly drove up to the event, a ""Muhammad Art Exhibit and Cartoon Contest,"" some time before 7 p.m. at the Curtis Culwell Center, a public event space run by the local school district. The two men opened fire on the event, wounding an unarmed security guard in the ankle, before being shot and killed by police, who were already nearby providing security.

The Associated Press reports that the bomb squad was called in to search the gunmen's bodies and their car for explosives. ""Because of the situation of what was going on today and the history of what we've been told has happened at other events like this, we are considering their car [is] possibly containing a bomb,"" Officer Joe Harn, a spokesman for the Garland Police Department, said at a news conference.

The gunmen have not yet been identified, and police say there were no credible threats made ahead of the event.

But the attack has already stirred comparisons to the deadly attack in Paris on the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, in which brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi killed 12 people, including several of the magazine's cartoonists, over its frequent depictions of the prophet Muhammad.

Indeed, yesterday's event was a direct response to one held on the same site in late January called ""Stand with the Prophet."" The Dallas Morning News reports that that January event spurred the American Freedom Defense Initiative (AFDI), a group led by prominent anti-Islam activist Pam Geller, to organize the cartoon contest at the same location. The AFDI is considered an extremist group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks extremist and hate organizations.

The event was attended Ms. Geller, who described it as an exercise of free speech, as well as prominent far-right politician Geert Wilders, head of the Dutch Freedom Party. Mr. Wilders reportedly gave the keynote speech, in which he similarly depicted anti-Muhammad imagery as a matter of free speech. ""Muhammad fought and terrorized people with the swords. Today, here in Garland, we fight Muhammad and his followers with the pen. And the pen, the drawings, will prove mightier than the sword,"" he said.

violence_in_america,Vox,0,http://www.vox.com/2016/9/21/12999366/keith-lamont-scott-north-carolina-police-shooting,Charlotte police release video of shooting of Keith Lamont Scott,2016-09-21,"German Lopez, Alex Ward, Li Zhou, Hannah Brown, Andrew Prokop, Jen Kirby","The Charlotte , North Carolina , police officer who shot and killed Keith Lamont Scott — a shooting that led to protests and riots in September — will not face criminal charges , the local prosecutor announced on Wednesday .
According to police , officers were looking for a wanted suspect with an outstanding warrant in Charlotte , the Washington Post reported . They reportedly saw Scott — who wasn ’ t the wanted suspect — rolling a marijuana blunt , then holding a gun . The officers , who were wearing plain clothes at the time , left to put on an outfit that would clearly mark them as officers , then approached Scott .
During the confrontation , Scott left his vehicle and backed away , allegedly with a gun still in his hand — posing what officers said was an imminent physical threat . Police gave multiple warnings to drop the gun before they opened fire . A black officer with the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department , Brentley Vinson , shot Scott , killing him .
After several days of protests in Charlotte , police finally released videos of the shooting — from other officers on the scene ( the officer who fired his gun did not have a body camera on ) and dashboard cameras . It is hard to tell in the videos whether Scott had anything in his hands at the time of the shooting , but Scott does not appear to aim anything at the police officers , contesting the police ’ s original claims .
Charlotte Police Chief Kerr Putney acknowledged as much , saying that the available video evidence does not prove that Scott threatened police with a gun : `` The video does not give me absolute , definitive visual evidence that would confirm that a person [ was ] pointing a gun . I did not see that in the videos that I reviewed . What I can tell you , though , is when taken in the totality of all the other evidence , it supports what we 've heard and the version of the truth that we gave about the circumstances that happened that led to the death of Mr . Scott . ''
Under the law , an officer must reasonably believe he or others are under immediate threat to use lethal force .
Police say they recovered the gun that Scott allegedly brandished from the scene . They later released images of the gun , an ankle holster , and the marijuana blunt .
BREAKING : @ CMPD releases photos of gun , ankle holster and marijuana `` blunt '' they say # KeithLamontScott had at time of encounter pic.twitter.com/Bx1OPVUQWy — WBTV News ( @ WBTV_News ) September 24 , 2016
District Attorney Andrew Murray said on Wednesday that Scott obtained the gun , which was previously stolen , 18 days before the fatal shooting . Investigators reportedly found Scott ’ s DNA on the grip and ammunition slide .
They did not find a book , despite some family members claiming that police had possibly mistaken a book Scott was reading for a gun .
Previously , the only video we had of the shooting came from Scott 's wife , who was on the scene recording the events as they unfolded . But her video offered no significant evidence : It was too far away from the scene to make out what Scott and police officers were doing , and the shooting happened out of frame . It also didn ’ t answer the crucial question of whether Scott had a gun and brandished it against police .
Vinson , the officer who shot Scott , was put on administrative leave as the shooting was investigated .
The shooting led to protests and even violence in Charlotte as people took to the streets to demonstrate against the shooting . To them , it is yet another example of the vast racial disparities in how American police use force .
The Charlotte protests turned violent in the first couple nights
On the first night of protests , several people — including 16 police officers — were injured , leading police to deploy tear gas to try to disperse crowds , according to WSOC-TV . On the second night , police again used tear gas to disperse crowds blocking an interstate , people allegedly looted some businesses , and one man was reportedly shot — reportedly by another civilian — and died . Things calmed down by the third night , when protests were peaceful .
Historian Heather Ann Thompson explained the simmering anger that boiled over into violence over the first couple nights :
In short , Charlotte is one of the wealthiest cities in the country , but this prosperity has n't touched overwhelmingly black West and Northeast Charlotte and it is one of the most heavily policed . And the police do n't spend much energy policing — throwing people up against cars on a regular basis to search them for drugs — in overwhelmingly white South Charlotte . And the excessive and aggressive policing of only Charlotte 's poorest and blackest neighborhoods leads there , as it does in every other city in the country , to the killing of citizens by the police . It has led there , as it has elsewhere to outrage .
As historians have told me , this is what leads to urban uprisings and riots . It 's typically not just one event — it 's a confluence of factors , some of which may not be readily apparent to observers . `` People participate in this type of event for a real reason , '' Darnell Hunt , a UCLA professor who 's studied the 1992 Rodney King riots in Los Angeles , said . `` It 's not just people taking advantage . It 's not just anger and frustration at the immediate or proximate cause . It 's always some underlying issues . ''
In this case , Charlotte protesters appear to be fed up with what they see as an abusive police force . This anger goes back to at least one recent police shooting that drew national headlines : the 2013 police shooting of Jonathan Ferrell , an unarmed 24-year-old black man who was shot 10 times and killed by a white police officer after he crashed his car .
These concerns are also shared by many in minority communities nationwide , with recent police shootings drawing widespread public and media scrutiny . In the days before the Charlotte protests , the Tulsa , Oklahoma , police shooting of unarmed Terence Crutcher also garnered national headlines .
But due to the lack of video for the first few days of protests , we largely only knew only what police had said about the shooting . For many critics of police , that was as good as knowing nothing . Trust in the police is fairly low in black communities across the country to begin with — only 30 percent of black people reported `` a great deal '' or `` quite a lot '' of confidence in the police during a 2014-'15 period , versus 57 percent of white people , according to Gallup .
And over the past few years , several police accounts of shootings or killings , such as the police shootings of Samuel DuBose in Cincinnati and Laquan McDonald in Chicago , have fallen apart when interrogated with video evidence . Coupled with the racial disparities , this made it particularly difficult for protesters to take cops at their word — leading to a real sense of anger that culminated in violent nights of protests .
Black people are much more likely to be killed by police than their white peers
An analysis of the available FBI data by ███ ’ s Dara Lind shows that US police kill black people at disproportionate rates : They accounted for 31 percent of police killing victims in 2012 , even though they made up just 13 percent of the US population . Although the data is incomplete , since it ’ s based on voluntary reports from police agencies around the country , it highlights the vast disparities in how police use force .
Black teens were 21 times as likely as white teens to be shot and killed by police between 2010 and 2012 , according to a ProPublica analysis of the FBI data . ProPublica ’ s Ryan Gabrielson , Ryann Grochowski Jones , and Eric Sagara reported : `` One way of appreciating that stark disparity , ProPublica ’ s analysis shows , is to calculate how many more whites over those three years would have had to have been killed for them to have been at equal risk . The number is jarring — 185 , more than one per week . ''
There have been several high-profile police killings since 2014 involving black suspects . In Baltimore , six police officers were indicted for the death of Freddie Gray while in police custody . In North Charleston , South Carolina , Michael Slager was charged with murder and fired from the police department after shooting Walter Scott , who was fleeing and unarmed at the time . In Ferguson , Darren Wilson killed unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown . In New York City , NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo killed Eric Garner by putting the unarmed 43-year-old black man in a chokehold .
BLACK TEENS WERE 21 TIMES AS LIKELY AS WHITE TEENS TO BE SHOT AND KILLED BY POLICE BETWEEN 2010 AND 2012
One possible explanation for the racial disparities : Police tend to patrol high-crime neighborhoods , which are disproportionately black . That means they 're going to be generally more likely to initiate a policing action , from traffic stops to more serious arrests , against a black person who lives in these areas . And all of these policing actions carry a chance , however small , to escalate into a violent confrontation .
That 's not to say that higher crime rates in black communities explain the entire racial disparity in police shootings . A 2015 study by researcher Cody Ross found , `` There is no relationship between county-level racial bias in police shootings and crime rates ( even race-specific crime rates ) , meaning that the racial bias observed in police shootings in this data set is not explainable as a response to local-level crime rates . '' That suggests something else — such as , potentially , racial bias — is going on .
One reason to believe racial bias is a factor : Studies show that officers are quicker to shoot black suspects in video game simulations . Josh Correll , a University of Colorado Boulder psychology professor who conducted the research , said it ’ s possible the bias could lead to even more skewed outcomes in the field . `` In the very situation in which [ officers ] most need their training , '' he said , `` we have some reason to believe that their training will be most likely to fail them . ''
Part of the solution to potential bias is better training that helps cops acknowledge and deal with their potential subconscious prejudices . But critics also argue that more accountability could help deter future brutality or excessive use of force , since it would make it clear that there are consequences to the misuse and abuse of police powers . Yet right now , lax legal standards make it difficult to legally punish individual police officers for use of force , even when it might be excessive .
Police only have to reasonably perceive a threat to justify shooting
Legally , what most matters in police shootings is whether police officers reasonably believed that their lives were in immediate danger , not whether the shooting victim actually posed a threat .
In the 1980s , a pair of Supreme Court decisions — Tennessee v. Garner and Graham v. Connor — set up a framework for determining when deadly force by cops is reasonable .
Constitutionally , `` police officers are allowed to shoot under two circumstances , '' David Klinger , a University of Missouri St. Louis professor who studies use of force , told ███ ’ s Lind . The first circumstance is `` to protect their life or the life of another innocent party '' — what departments call the `` defense-of-life '' standard . The second circumstance is to prevent a suspect from escaping , but only if the officer has probable cause to think the suspect poses a dangerous threat to others .
The logic behind the second circumstance , Klinger said , comes from a Supreme Court decision called Tennessee v. Garner . That case involved a pair of police officers who shot a 15-year-old boy as he fled from a burglary . ( He ’ d stolen $ 10 and a purse from a house . ) The court ruled that cops couldn ’ t shoot every felon who tried to escape . But , as Klinger said , `` they basically say that the job of a cop is to protect people from violence , and if you ’ ve got a violent person who ’ s fleeing , you can shoot them to stop their flight . ''
THE KEY TO BOTH OF THE LEGAL STANDARDS IS THAT IT DOESN ’ T MATTER WHETHER THERE IS AN ACTUAL THREAT WHEN FORCE IS USED
The key to both of the legal standards — defense of life and fleeing a violent felony — is that it doesn ’ t matter whether there is an actual threat when force is used . Instead , what matters is the officer ’ s `` objectively reasonable '' belief that there is a threat .
That standard comes from the other Supreme Court case that guides use-of-force decisions : Graham v. Connor . This was a civil lawsuit brought by a man who ’ d survived his encounter with police officers , but who ’ d been treated roughly , had his face shoved into the hood of a car , and broken his foot — all while he was suffering a diabetic attack .
The court didn ’ t rule on whether the officers ’ treatment of him had been justified , but it did say that the officers couldn ’ t justify their conduct just based on whether their intentions were good . They had to demonstrate that their actions were `` objectively reasonable , '' given the circumstances and compared to what other police officers might do .
What ’ s `` objectively reasonable '' changes as the circumstances change . `` One can ’ t just say , 'Because I could use deadly force 10 seconds ago , that means I can use deadly force again now , '' Walter Katz , a California attorney who specializes in oversight of law enforcement agencies , said .
In general , officers are given lot of legal latitude to use force without fear of punishment . The intention behind these legal standards is to give police officers leeway to make split-second decisions to protect themselves and bystanders . And although critics argue that these legal standards give law enforcement a license to kill innocent or unarmed people , police officers say they are essential to their safety .
For some critics , the question isn ’ t what ’ s legally justified but rather what ’ s preventable . `` We have to get beyond what is legal and start focusing on what is preventable . Most are preventable , '' Ronald Davis , a former police chief who heads the Justice Department ’ s Office of Community Oriented Policing Services , told the Washington Post . Police `` need to stop chasing down suspects , hopping fences , and landing on top of someone with a gun , '' he added . `` When they do that , they have no choice but to shoot . ''
Police are very rarely prosecuted for shootings — and not just because the law allows them wide latitude to use force on the job . Sometimes the investigations fall onto the same police department the officer is from , which creates major conflicts of interest . Other times the only available evidence comes from eyewitnesses , who may not be as trustworthy in the public eye as a police officer .
`` There is a tendency to believe an officer over a civilian , in terms of credibility , '' David Rudovsky , a civil rights lawyer who co-wrote Prosecuting Misconduct : Law and Litigation , told Amanda Taub for ███ . `` And when an officer is on trial , reasonable doubt has a lot of bite . A prosecutor needs a very strong case before a jury will say that somebody who we generally trust to protect us has so seriously crossed the line as to be subject to a conviction . ''
If police are charged , they ’ re very rarely convicted . The National Police Misconduct Reporting Project analyzed 3,238 criminal cases against police officers from April 2009 through December 2010 . They found that only 33 percent were convicted , and only 36 percent of officers who were convicted ended up serving prison sentences . Both of those are about half the rate at which members of the public are convicted or incarcerated .
The statistics suggest that it would have been a truly rare situation if the officer who shot and killed Scott was charged and convicted of a crime .","The Charlotte, North Carolina, police officer who shot and killed Keith Lamont Scott — a shooting that led to protests and riots in September — will not face criminal charges, the local prosecutor announced on Wednesday.

Yet right now, lax legal standards make it difficult to legally punish individual police officers for use of force, even when it might be excessive.

Police only have to reasonably perceive a threat to justify shooting

Legally, what most matters in police shootings is whether police officers reasonably believed that their lives were in immediate danger, not whether the shooting victim actually posed a threat.

In the 1980s, a pair of Supreme Court decisions — Tennessee v. Garner and Graham v. Connor — set up a framework for determining when deadly force by cops is reasonable.

Constitutionally, ""police officers are allowed to shoot under two circumstances,"" David Klinger, a University of Missouri St. Louis professor who studies use of force, told Vox’s Lind. The first circumstance is ""to protect their life or the life of another innocent party"" — what departments call the ""defense-of-life"" standard. The second circumstance is to prevent a suspect from escaping, but only if the officer has probable cause to think the suspect poses a dangerous threat to others.

The logic behind the second circumstance, Klinger said, comes from a Supreme Court decision called Tennessee v. Garner. That case involved a pair of police officers who shot a 15-year-old boy as he fled from a burglary. (He’d stolen $10 and a purse from a house.) The court ruled that cops couldn’t shoot every felon who tried to escape. But, as Klinger said, ""they basically say that the job of a cop is to protect people from violence, and if you’ve got a violent person who’s fleeing, you can shoot them to stop their flight.""

THE KEY TO BOTH OF THE LEGAL STANDARDS IS THAT IT DOESN’T MATTER WHETHER THERE IS AN ACTUAL THREAT WHEN FORCE IS USED

The key to both of the legal standards — defense of life and fleeing a violent felony — is that it doesn’t matter whether there is an actual threat when force is used. Instead, what matters is the officer’s ""objectively reasonable"" belief that there is a threat.

That standard comes from the other Supreme Court case that guides use-of-force decisions: Graham v. Connor. This was a civil lawsuit brought by a man who’d survived his encounter with police officers, but who’d been treated roughly, had his face shoved into the hood of a car, and broken his foot — all while he was suffering a diabetic attack.

The court didn’t rule on whether the officers’ treatment of him had been justified, but it did say that the officers couldn’t justify their conduct just based on whether their intentions were good. They had to demonstrate that their actions were ""objectively reasonable,"" given the circumstances and compared to what other police officers might do.

What’s ""objectively reasonable"" changes as the circumstances change. ""One can’t just say, 'Because I could use deadly force 10 seconds ago, that means I can use deadly force again now,"" Walter Katz, a California attorney who specializes in oversight of law enforcement agencies, said.

In general, officers are given lot of legal latitude to use force without fear of punishment. The intention behind these legal standards is to give police officers leeway to make split-second decisions to protect themselves and bystanders. And although critics argue that these legal standards give law enforcement a license to kill innocent or unarmed people, police officers say they are essential to their safety.

For some critics, the question isn’t what’s legally justified but rather what’s preventable. ""We have to get beyond what is legal and start focusing on what is preventable. Most are preventable,"" Ronald Davis, a former police chief who heads the Justice Department’s Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, told the Washington Post. Police ""need to stop chasing down suspects, hopping fences, and landing on top of someone with a gun,"" he added. ""When they do that, they have no choice but to shoot.""

Police rarely get prosecuted for shootings

Police are very rarely prosecuted for shootings — and not just because the law allows them wide latitude to use force on the job. Sometimes the investigations fall onto the same police department the officer is from, which creates major conflicts of interest. Other times the only available evidence comes from eyewitnesses, who may not be as trustworthy in the public eye as a police officer.

""There is a tendency to believe an officer over a civilian, in terms of credibility,"" David Rudovsky, a civil rights lawyer who co-wrote Prosecuting Misconduct: Law and Litigation, told Amanda Taub for Vox. ""And when an officer is on trial, reasonable doubt has a lot of bite. A prosecutor needs a very strong case before a jury will say that somebody who we generally trust to protect us has so seriously crossed the line as to be subject to a conviction.""

If police are charged, they’re very rarely convicted. The National Police Misconduct Reporting Project analyzed 3,238 criminal cases against police officers from April 2009 through December 2010. They found that only 33 percent were convicted, and only 36 percent of officers who were convicted ended up serving prison sentences. Both of those are about half the rate at which members of the public are convicted or incarcerated.

The statistics suggest that it would have been a truly rare situation if the officer who shot and killed Scott was charged and convicted of a crime.",www.vox.com,left,YFQp0H6RFZjwKwA9

On Monday , students at a St. Louis elementary school held a moment of silence for their 8-year-old classmate , Jurnee Thompson , who was shot and killed outside a restaurant after a football game . Over the weekend , other children attended the funeral of Xavier Usanga , a 7-year-old who died after a bullet pierced his throat while he was playing with his sisters in their backyard . Since April , at least 13 black kids and teenagers in the city of St. Louis have died as a result of gunfire in what has been one of the deadliest and most violent summers for young people in the city in years . So many children have have been shot and killed in such a short time that police are offering $ 100,000 — $ 25,000 for four cases involving a child under 10 — until Sept. 1 for any information to help solve some of the cases . Officials have arrested only one suspect in the string of killings , with police begging the community for help at a press conference Saturday . St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson explained that the short time window in which tipsters could claim the reward money `` expresses the urgency of the situation . '' “ This is urgent , ” said Mayor Krewson , telling the crowd how `` reckless gun violence '' claimed the life of 8-year-old Thompson , who was shot in the head while standing next to her family , waiting for their food . `` We are all at risk when these suspects remain on the street , '' she urged . `` If you are as outraged as I am ... please help . '' Federal data ranks St. Louis as one of the most violent cities in the US , with a murder rate that has hovered between 186 and 205 since 2015 , one of the highest in the country . As of Monday , police had recorded 134 homicide cases in 2019 ; guns were used in nearly all of them . The murder rate in East St. Louis , which has a population of about 26,000 , is 19 times higher than the national average . More than 95 % of the residents are black and the majority of families live in poverty . The Belleville News Democrat compiled data from 2000 to 2018 and found that 83 % of 410 murders with a cause of death were gun-related . More than 90 % of the victims were black and 75 % of homicides were never solved . However , experts say that because the victims are black and lower-income , their stories do not permeate the national conversation when it comes to gun violence . `` When looking at coverage of issues like gun violence , we ca n't ignore the systemic issues that disproportionately affect black and brown people , '' said Martin Reynolds , co-executive director of the Maynard Institute , which advocates for diversity in the news media . Ignoring how race , socioeconomic status , and lack of opportunity have lead to `` disproportionate amounts of gun violence in communities '' like St. Louis is part of the problem , Reynolds told ███ . `` How would this series of horrific shootings of children and teens be covered by journalists if this violence happened in a white , middle class neighborhood ? '' he asked . `` It would be cast , as it should be , as a public health crisis and a system in need of structural change . '' As gun violence has intensified , ripping through barbecues , family gatherings , and football games , more and more children have been caught in the crossfire . In 2016 , 12 children in the St. Louis metro area died in shootings . In 2017 , that number jumped to 19 . So far this year , 18 kids are dead as a result of gunfire , according to data compiled by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch . `` Ask anyone in this city about this and they will tell you that we are going through an extreme time , '' Meredith Pierce , a spokesperson for the St. Louis Public Schools , told ███ on Monday . `` This has been a more violent time than I can ever remember , and I 've been at this job for six and a half years . It 's been horrible . '' The school district has lost nine current and former students this year : football players , second-graders , first-year high school students , 16-year-olds . It has three crisis teams that it sends to campuses to help students and teachers process losing a child to gun violence . Counselors visited two separate schools to provide comfort and mental health resources Monday , Pierce said . The victims range in age . Six of the victims died before their eleventh birthday . Five others will never graduate from high school , according to data from St. Louis Police , which classifies a `` juvenile '' as under the age of 17 .
They have been shot playing outside , sitting on their front porches , eating pizza , walking home , standing near a restaurant . They had different hobbies and family histories . But , police confirmed , they `` are all black . '' Twenty-four hours after announcing the award Saturday , police responded to yet another report of a teenager who was found dead with a gunshot wound to his head . His name was Sentonio Cox and he was 15 .
On April 30 , 2-year-old Kayden Johnson and his mother , Trina'ty Riley , were shot to death while hiding in a closet after an intruder broke into their home , police said .
Elijah Johnson , Kayden 's father , told KMOV-TV that the pain `` is unbelievable . ''
`` He was uplifting , he was always smiling , '' Johnson said of his son .
Not even a month later , authorities found Kristina Curry shot to death in Roosevelt High School 's parking lot . She was a junior , about to turn 17 , and she loved to spend time with her family and garden , her mother , Christian Curry , told KSDK-TV . `` Her spirit was always high ... I ca n't wrap my brain around when did it become OK to hurt our children . When did it become OK to just hurt each other , '' her mother said .
The shootings intensified as summer loomed . June was particularly deadly — four children were fatally shot in just five days that month . Around 10:30 p.m. on June 8 , Jashon Johnson was found near a park with multiple gunshot wounds . The 16-year-old later died at the hospital . The next day , 3-year-old Kennedi Powell was shot while standing on the sidewalk in front of her house , eating pizza , when a white car pulled up , police said .

On Monday, students at a St. Louis elementary school held a moment of silence for their 8-year-old classmate, Jurnee Thompson, who was shot and killed outside a restaurant after a football game. Over the weekend, other children attended the funeral of Xavier Usanga, a 7-year-old who died after a bullet pierced his throat while he was playing with his sisters in their backyard. Since April, at least 13 black kids and teenagers in the city of St. Louis have died as a result of gunfire in what has been one of the deadliest and most violent summers for young people in the city in years. So many children have have been shot and killed in such a short time that police are offering $100,000 — $25,000 for four cases involving a child under 10 — until Sept. 1 for any information to help solve some of the cases. Officials have arrested only one suspect in the string of killings, with police begging the community for help at a press conference Saturday. St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson explained that the short time window in which tipsters could claim the reward money ""expresses the urgency of the situation."" “This is urgent,” said Mayor Krewson, telling the crowd how ""reckless gun violence"" claimed the life of 8-year-old Thompson, who was shot in the head while standing next to her family, waiting for their food. ""We are all at risk when these suspects remain on the street,"" she urged. ""If you are as outraged as I am ... please help."" Federal data ranks St. Louis as one of the most violent cities in the US, with a murder rate that has hovered between 186 and 205 since 2015, one of the highest in the country. As of Monday, police had recorded 134 homicide cases in 2019; guns were used in nearly all of them. The murder rate in East St. Louis, which has a population of about 26,000, is 19 times higher than the national average. More than 95% of the residents are black and the majority of families live in poverty. The Belleville News Democrat compiled data from 2000 to 2018 and found that 83% of 410 murders with a cause of death were gun-related. More than 90% of the victims were black and 75% of homicides were never solved. However, experts say that because the victims are black and lower-income, their stories do not permeate the national conversation when it comes to gun violence. ""When looking at coverage of issues like gun violence, we can't ignore the systemic issues that disproportionately affect black and brown people,"" said Martin Reynolds, co-executive director of the Maynard Institute, which advocates for diversity in the news media. Ignoring how race, socioeconomic status, and lack of opportunity have lead to ""disproportionate amounts of gun violence in communities"" like St. Louis is part of the problem, Reynolds told BuzzFeed News. ""How would this series of horrific shootings of children and teens be covered by journalists if this violence happened in a white, middle class neighborhood?"" he asked. ""It would be cast, as it should be, as a public health crisis and a system in need of structural change."" As gun violence has intensified, ripping through barbecues, family gatherings, and football games, more and more children have been caught in the crossfire. In 2016, 12 children in the St. Louis metro area died in shootings. In 2017, that number jumped to 19. So far this year, 18 kids are dead as a result of gunfire, according to data compiled by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. ""Ask anyone in this city about this and they will tell you that we are going through an extreme time,"" Meredith Pierce, a spokesperson for the St. Louis Public Schools, told BuzzFeed News on Monday. ""This has been a more violent time than I can ever remember, and I've been at this job for six and a half years. It's been horrible."" The school district has lost nine current and former students this year: football players, second-graders, first-year high school students, 16-year-olds. It has three crisis teams that it sends to campuses to help students and teachers process losing a child to gun violence. Counselors visited two separate schools to provide comfort and mental health resources Monday, Pierce said. The victims range in age. Six of the victims died before their eleventh birthday. Five others will never graduate from high school, according to data from St. Louis Police, which classifies a ""juvenile"" as under the age of 17.

They have been shot playing outside, sitting on their front porches, eating pizza, walking home, standing near a restaurant. They had different hobbies and family histories. But, police confirmed, they ""are all black."" Twenty-four hours after announcing the award Saturday, police responded to yet another report of a teenager who was found dead with a gunshot wound to his head. His name was Sentonio Cox and he was 15.



On April 30, 2-year-old Kayden Johnson and his mother, Trina'ty Riley, were shot to death while hiding in a closet after an intruder broke into their home, police said.

Elijah Johnson, Kayden's father, told KMOV-TV that the pain ""is unbelievable.""

""He was uplifting, he was always smiling,"" Johnson said of his son.

Not even a month later, authorities found Kristina Curry shot to death in Roosevelt High School's parking lot. She was a junior, about to turn 17, and she loved to spend time with her family and garden, her mother, Christian Curry, told KSDK-TV. ""Her spirit was always high ... I can't wrap my brain around when did it become OK to hurt our children. When did it become OK to just hurt each other,"" her mother said.

No arrests have been made in either case.

The shootings intensified as summer loomed. June was particularly deadly — four children were fatally shot in just five days that month. Around 10:30 p.m. on June 8, Jashon Johnson was found near a park with multiple gunshot wounds. The 16-year-old later died at the hospital. The next day, 3-year-old Kennedi Powell was shot while standing on the sidewalk in front of her house, eating pizza, when a white car pulled up, police said. After the gunfire stopped, her mother, Nyeshia Haymore, told the Post-Dispatch that her daughter was lying on the sidewalk, still holding her slice of pizza. She had a ""big personality,"" her family told local media, and loved to ""run off and pinch you."" A 6-year-old girl was also wounded in the shooting, according to police.

On June 24, Michael Henderson Jr., a sophomore at East St. Louis High School, died in a shooting at a convenience store.

Saving the file is the first step

""If I had something really hot, and I was worried it would be suppressed somehow, I would back it up as soon as possible. That might mean sending it somewhere in the cloud or to a trusted third party, or making a backup at home.""

Remember that the name of the videographer will be in the news — and forever connected to the story

violence_in_america,USA TODAY,1,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/03/19/tripwire-may-have-set-off-austin-blast/437277002/,"Austin bombings: Tripwire may have set off latest blast, and 'that changes things'",2018-03-19,,"AUSTIN — An explosion that seriously wounded two men and rocked a quiet southwest neighborhood appears connected to a string of mysterious and sometimes deadly blasts this month that have fueled fear across the Texas capital , authorities said Monday .
“ Clearly , we are dealing with a serial bomber , ” Police Chief Brian Manley said .
Manley said a bomb placed alongside a fence had tripwire the men triggered with their bikes Sunday night . The use of a tripwire , he said , reflects a `` higher level of sophistication '' than the technology used in the earlier bombings .
Manley said the men suffered `` significant '' injuries . He said a sweep indicated the area was safe , but he urged residents within a half-mile of the blast site to remain indoors until 2 p.m. local time .
The chief also said 500 law enforcement officials involved in the case at the local , state and federal levels have found “ persons of interest , ” but no clear suspects have emerged . Authorities asked residents to share home-security video for clues .
Austin resident Leith El-Hassan , 42 , said he initially mistook the explosion for thunder .
`` We don ’ t know what ’ s next , '' he said . `` They have no suspect . It ’ s just sad that someone is so angry they do this random stuff . ”
Nearby resident Richard Herrington , 75 , said he heard the blast and immediately knew it was a bomb .
“ My initial emotional reaction was , ‘ Oh my goodness , I walked my granddaughters right by there , ’ ” he said , adding that he was encouraged by the law enforcement response . `` At this point we ’ re probably in the safest neighborhood you can possibly be in . ''
The previous three blasts involved suspicious packages left on doorsteps . Manley said the latest bomb , near a road and including tripwire technology , `` changes things . ''
Authorities previously warned residents not to handle unidentified or suspicious packages left at their homes . Now residents must have an `` extra level of vigilance '' to stay clear of any questionable package — and call 911 .
`` Our safety message to this point has been ... do not handle packages , do not pick up packages , do not disturb packages , '' Manley said . `` We now need the community to have an extra level of vigilance and pay attention to any suspicious device — whether it be a package , a bag , a backpack — anything that looks out of place . Do not approach it . ''

Hours before the blast , Manley had pleaded publicly for the bomber to turn himself in . After the blast , scores of law enforcement officers , including FBI agents , flooded the neighborhood of single-family brick homes to investigate .
Texas Gov . Greg Abbott announced the state is committing $ 265,000 to the effort to solve the bombings .
“ I want to ensure everyone in the Austin region and the entire state that Texas is committed to providing every resource necessary to make sure these crimes are solved as quickly as possible , ” Abbott said . “ I offer my sincere thanks to law enforcement at the local , state and federal level for their efforts to ensure that those responsible for these attacks are apprehended and brought to justice . ”
Frederick Milanowski , ATF special agent in charge , said the tripwire was similar to fishing wire and would have been difficult to see at the time of detonation . Investigators were studying the components of the bomb and injuries to the victims to learn more about the explosives , he said .
The bombs may be different , but the bombmaker is the same , he said .
“ We have a high degree of confidence the same individual built all these devices , ” he said .
Milanowski said the trip wire used in the explosive was strung near a trailhead and anchored with a metal yard sign , believed to have been brought by the bomb-maker .
Bomb-makers usually build the same explosive over and over , once they have a working prototype , to cut down chances of an accidental detonation , Milanowski said . What makes Sunday ’ s incident concerning is that the explosive strayed from previous devices , was more sophisticated and was more random , rather than targeted , as the previous three bombs appear to be , he said .
“ The really concerning part is that it was so random , ” Milanowski said .
Bomb components have been shipped to the ATF national laboratory in Beltstville , MD. , where technicians are running chemical , fingerprint and DNA analysis on the components and shrapnel , he said . Meanwhile , more than 500 local , state and federal agents have combed through 400 tips and more than 500 leads , Milanowski said .
“ There ’ s more state and federal resources on this investigation than any investigation Austin has ever seen , ” he said , adding : “ There ’ s a lot of information out there . There will be no rock left unturned . ”
Two people were killed and two wounded in the earlier attacks . Each had been similar : A plain cardboard box with standard shipping labels was left on a doorstep . Each package had a bomb inside .
Police initially raised the possibility of a hate crime because victims in the first two explosions were black . The third apparent target was Hispanic . The victims of Sunday 's blast were white , Manley said . And the first three attacks , unlike the attack Sunday , took place in the eastern part of the city .
Christopher Combs , an FBI agent stationed in San Antonio who was sent to Austin to assist in the investigation , said the varying locations of the four attacks means surrounding communities should also be on guard .
Security analyst Fred Burton of Austin-based Stratfor Worldview , an international security consulting firm , said it was too soon to rule in or rule out international terrorism based on the neighborhoods targeted .
“ Is it terrorism ? We don ’ t know yet , ” Burton said . “ But we do know that he is terrorizing Austin . ''
Burton said the latest attack indicates the bomber was trying to “ stay one step ahead of APD and the ATF . ”

AUSTIN — An explosion that seriously wounded two men and rocked a quiet southwest neighborhood appears connected to a string of mysterious and sometimes deadly blasts this month that have fueled fear across the Texas capital, authorities said Monday.

“Clearly, we are dealing with a serial bomber,” Police Chief Brian Manley said.

Manley said a bomb placed alongside a fence had tripwire the men triggered with their bikes Sunday night. The use of a tripwire, he said, reflects a ""higher level of sophistication"" than the technology used in the earlier bombings.

Manley said the men suffered ""significant"" injuries. He said a sweep indicated the area was safe, but he urged residents within a half-mile of the blast site to remain indoors until 2 p.m. local time.

The chief also said 500 law enforcement officials involved in the case at the local, state and federal levels have found “persons of interest,” but no clear suspects have emerged. Authorities asked residents to share home-security video for clues.

Austin resident Leith El-Hassan, 42, said he initially mistook the explosion for thunder.

""We don’t know what’s next,"" he said. ""They have no suspect. It’s just sad that someone is so angry they do this random stuff.”

Nearby resident Richard Herrington, 75, said he heard the blast and immediately knew it was a bomb.

“My initial emotional reaction was, ‘Oh my goodness, I walked my granddaughters right by there,’” he said, adding that he was encouraged by the law enforcement response. ""At this point we’re probably in the safest neighborhood you can possibly be in.""

The previous three blasts involved suspicious packages left on doorsteps. Manley said the latest bomb, near a road and including tripwire technology, ""changes things.""

Authorities previously warned residents not to handle unidentified or suspicious packages left at their homes. Now residents must have an ""extra level of vigilance"" to stay clear of any questionable package — and call 911.

""Our safety message to this point has been ... do not handle packages, do not pick up packages, do not disturb packages,"" Manley said. ""We now need the community to have an extra level of vigilance and pay attention to any suspicious device — whether it be a package, a bag, a backpack — anything that looks out of place. Do not approach it.""

Hours before the blast, Manley had pleaded publicly for the bomber to turn himself in. After the blast, scores of law enforcement officers, including FBI agents, flooded the neighborhood of single-family brick homes to investigate.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced the state is committing $265,000 to the effort to solve the bombings.

“I want to ensure everyone in the Austin region and the entire state that Texas is committed to providing every resource necessary to make sure these crimes are solved as quickly as possible,” Abbott said. “I offer my sincere thanks to law enforcement at the local, state and federal level for their efforts to ensure that those responsible for these attacks are apprehended and brought to justice.”

Frederick Milanowski, ATF special agent in charge, said the tripwire was similar to fishing wire and would have been difficult to see at the time of detonation. Investigators were studying the components of the bomb and injuries to the victims to learn more about the explosives, he said.

The bombs may be different, but the bombmaker is the same, he said.

“We have a high degree of confidence the same individual built all these devices,” he said.

Milanowski said the trip wire used in the explosive was strung near a trailhead and anchored with a metal yard sign, believed to have been brought by the bomb-maker.

Bomb-makers usually build the same explosive over and over, once they have a working prototype, to cut down chances of an accidental detonation, Milanowski said. What makes Sunday’s incident concerning is that the explosive strayed from previous devices, was more sophisticated and was more random, rather than targeted, as the previous three bombs appear to be, he said.

“The really concerning part is that it was so random,” Milanowski said.

Bomb components have been shipped to the ATF national laboratory in Beltstville, MD., where technicians are running chemical, fingerprint and DNA analysis on the components and shrapnel, he said. Meanwhile, more than 500 local, state and federal agents have combed through 400 tips and more than 500 leads, Milanowski said.

“There’s more state and federal resources on this investigation than any investigation Austin has ever seen,” he said, adding: “There’s a lot of information out there. There will be no rock left unturned.”

Two people were killed and two wounded in the earlier attacks. Each had been similar: A plain cardboard box with standard shipping labels was left on a doorstep. Each package had a bomb inside.

Police initially raised the possibility of a hate crime because victims in the first two explosions were black. The third apparent target was Hispanic. The victims of Sunday's blast were white, Manley said. And the first three attacks, unlike the attack Sunday, took place in the eastern part of the city.

Christopher Combs, an FBI agent stationed in San Antonio who was sent to Austin to assist in the investigation, said the varying locations of the four attacks means surrounding communities should also be on guard.

Security analyst Fred Burton of Austin-based Stratfor Worldview, an international security consulting firm, said it was too soon to rule in or rule out international terrorism based on the neighborhoods targeted.

“Is it terrorism? We don’t know yet,” Burton said. “But we do know that he is terrorizing Austin.""

Burton said the latest attack indicates the bomber was trying to “stay one step ahead of APD and the ATF.”

The blast occurred on the final day of the popular South By Southwest festival, which attracts global leaders in business, technology, music and film. Authorities said investigators believe the bomber might be sending a message — but they don't know what it is.

“I think we’re looking at a pretty good bombmaker — because all four devices worked,” Burton said. “What we learned from this is that in all probability, this is somebody with military EOD (explosive ordnance disposal) training. I think he’s above average intellect.”

A reward for information leading to an arrest in the case increased to $100,000 from $50,000. That, along with an award from the governor's office, brings the total reward to $115,000.

“There’s more state and federal resources on this investigation than any investigation Austin has ever seen,” Milanowksi said. “There’s a lot of information out there. There will be no rock left unturned.”

FORT LAUDERDALE — The man accused of a bloody shooting spree that left five people dead and six wounded at the international airport here faces a court appearance Monday while the motive for his rampage remains a mystery.

Iraq war veteran Esteban Santiago, 26, is accused of an act of violence at an airport resulting in death, along with two firearms offenses. More charges are likely as the investigation into Friday's attack continues.

Yellow caution tape blocked access to some areas of the airport's Terminal 2 on Sunday. The airport returned to full flight operations, but a combination of factors led to long lines for travelers.

Santiago will appear before a federal magistrate on Monday, when he'll get a court-appointed lawyer if he needs one. Authorities investigating the shooting said they had not ruled out a terrorism motive.

George Piro, FBI special agent in charge of the Miami office, has said it was not clear why Santiago decided to fly from his home in Anchorage to carry out the shooting here. Authorities have conducted almost 200 interviews and are scouring social media, digging for clues that might shed light on what prompted so heinous a crime.

TMZ released video that appears to show the suspect drawing a semiautomatic handgun and firing the first shots before he walks out of the camera shot. The website did not reveal the source of the video. Authorities say he gave himself up after running out of ammunition.

Santiago is no stranger to federal law enforcement. In November, he walked into FBI offices in Anchorage and told agents he was a victim of mind control and was being forced to watch Islamic State videos. The FBI conducted a background check and found no connection to terror groups.

A 20-year-old protester has been charged with shooting two police officers in Ferguson, Mo., last week, authorities said Sunday.

County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch said Jeffrey Williams was charged with two counts of assault in the first degree, one count of firing a weapon from a vehicle and three counts of armed criminal action.

McCulloch said Williams admitted firing the shots but said he was shooting at someone else.

""We're not sure we buy that part of it,"" McCulloch said, adding that the handgun used in the shooting has been recovered.

He said Williams was involved in the demonstration that was wrapping up when the incident took place. Williams, he said, was being held in lieu of $300,000 cash bail.

McCulloch said information provided by the public was key to the arrest. He encouraged anyone who knows anything about the shooting to contact police, saying the investigation was continuing.

Williams has had several minor run-ins with police and one felony arrest in St. Louis, court records show.

He spent two days in jail last March for failing to appear for court hearings for traffic infractions, including driving without a valid license and operating a motor vehicle without maintaining proper insurance. He also spent two days in jail in January 2014 for speeding.

Police arrested Williams in June 2013 for receiving stolen property, a felony, and credit card fraud. He was sentenced in March 2014 to two years probation.

Bishop Derrick Robinson of the Kingdom Destiny Fellowship International, who has been an organizer of Ferguson protests, later told CNN he spoke with Williams -- and that Williams said he was not involved in protests. He said Williams told him the shooting occurred after he had been robbed by an unknown assailant.

The officers were shot during a protest just after midnight Thursday. One was shot in the face, the other in the shoulder. They were released from the hospital later Thursday.

Ferguson has been the scene of sometimes violent protests since the shooting death of unarmed black man Michael Brown, 18, by a white police officer in August. The shooting and subsequent investigation brought national attention and a Justice Department probe to the St. Louis suburb.

The Justice Department investigation found systemic racism in the police department, prompting the resignation of the city manager, a local judge and the city's police chief.

Attorney General Eric Holder issued a statement lauding the investigative cooperation between federal authorities and St. Louis County officials.

""This arrest sends a clear message that acts of violence against our law enforcement personnel will never be tolerated,"" Holder said in the statement. ""In the days ahead, we will continue to partner with the authorities in St. Louis County to secure justice for all those affected by this heinous and cowardly crime. And we will continue to stand vigilant in support of public safety officers and the communities they serve.""

The officers wounded Thursday were from St. Louis County and Webster Groves. After the shootings, the highway patrol and county police took control of security duties from the Ferguson department.

Hours after the shooting, Holder and Obama condemned the attack.

""They're criminals. They need to be arrested,"" Obama said. ""And then what we need to do is make sure that like-minded, good-spirited people on both sides -- law-enforcement who have a terrifically tough job and people who understand they don't want to be stopped and harassed because of their race -- that we're able to work together to try and come up with some good answers.""

Yet as protests sparked by the police killing of George Floyd continue , and violence , looting , and vandalism spread across the country , the 500 feet traversed by my block may spell out the two most-likely futures for a country that seems close to experiencing its most violent season since 1968 , when major riots seemed part of everyday life . Do you see today 's protests as representing the nonviolent , righteous anger of brutalized minorities who have had enough and are now demanding an end to a murderous status quo ? Or do you see them as unleashing anarchy and chaos while masquerading as social justice ? How you respond to them not only says something about you but about where the country might end up .
At the west end of my block , Bleecker intersects with Lafayette Street ; there sits Kith , a hip , expensive streetwear shop so popular that it used to meter guests in with a velvet-rope system like a trendy nightclub would . When the coronavirus lockdowns went into effect , clothing stores were deemed nonessential by the powers that be , so Kith locked its doors and emptied the store of all merchandise to prevent would-be thieves from breaking in . You 'd walk by the windows and just see naked shelves where $ 300 sweatsuits and $ 50 knit caps once hung .
This past Sunday , though , the owners boarded up the windows with plywood , as if a hurricane were coming ( many businesses throughout the city did the same ) . They should n't have bothered . On Monday morning , I walked by the store around 7 a.m. and saw that the plywood had been peeled back in places and some of the windows smashed . Kith merchandise bags were strewn out on the street .
The damage was just part of massive looting throughout the neighborhood . A couple of blocks away on Houston Street near Broadway , a massive Adidas store was wiped clean of virtually all of its stock , with many of its windows broken . Early on Monday morning , I even saw two latecomer looters storm out of the store with armfuls of clothing and into their car , which they 'd left running on the street . Around the corner on Broadway , an NYPD vehicle used by traffic cops was completely scorched and gutted , left in the street like the carcass of an exotic beast . Storefronts had smashed windows and many had , like the Adidas store , been wiped out of all but display stands . `` Dozens of suspected looters were arrested in Soho Sunday night as protests over the death of George Floyd descended into chaos , '' reported The New York Post .
In response to the damage , on Monday , Kith 's owners started building a stronger barrier around the perimeter of the store , this time using a scaffolding system and thick green panels that were about 30 feet high . By the end of today , the barrier stood even taller and more imposing , providing what one assumes is an impervious defense to whatever mayhem the night in Gotham might bring .
New York 's curfew kicks in at 8 p.m. for the rest of the week , in an attempt to put an end to a couple of days of what The Daily Beast 's Rachel Olding has described as `` complete anarchy . '' Throughout the city on Sunday and Monday nights , Olding documented in her Twitter feed roving bands of mostly young people were breaking into stores and running out with all sorts of merchandise .
Hard to describe how rampant the looting was tonight in Midtown Manhattan and how lawless it was . Complete anarchy . Literally hundreds of stores up and down Broadway , Fifth Ave , Sixth Ave . Kids ruling the streets like it was a party . pic.twitter.com/y9Ly1UD1WX — Rachel Olding ( @ rachelolding ) June 2 , 2020
The response of Kith 's owners is emblematic of one way of dealing with the new reality in New York : hunker down more and more , worried about chaos . The coronavirus lockdown had been stultifying , but it did n't inspire fear the way the past few nights have . The city 's streets had been deserted but they were also peaceful . Now , they are still mostly vacant but the nights are also punctuated by sirens , shouts , and the sounds of breaking glass . Police helicopters patrol the sky , providing a background rumble to the darkness .
In an encouraging sign , last night was calm . There was a massive show of force by the NYPD once the curfew hit and next to no looting . `` Some protesters lingered and looting appeared to lessen with an earlier curfew , '' reports The New York Times . If there is relative calm until the curfew expires at the end of the week , even more of the tension will dissipate .
Anxiety about looting will also fade if there are more events like the one I witnessed yesterday at the other end of my block , where Bleecker meets Bowery . Around 4:30 p.m. , a large , long , loud protest march streamed by , headed uptown , with thousands of people chanting , shouting , and making noise . Police were present , restrained , and sometimes smiling , even as the protesters called out law enforcement for killing George Floyd and other misdeeds .

Police reform is needed . @ ███ @ realDonaldTrump @ JoeBiden # GeorgeFloyd pic.twitter.com/i0vZNXmQJ5 — Nick Gillespie ( @ nickgillespie ) June 2 , 2020
All told , it took about 20 minutes or more for the protesters to pass by , a testament to their number and energy . They were a mix of ages , races , and genders—a Benetton ad for social action and social justice . These probably are n't the same people doing late-night smash-and-grabs at Footlocker stores and CVS pharmacies around the city . Protest organizers seem to be increasingly vigilant about making sure to keep their distance from the more-destructive elements . The Times ' account of last night includes this :
As some people banged on windows at two stores at the intersection of Vesey Street and Broadway early on , a young organizer shouted into a microphone , `` Stay calm and peaceful '' and `` Keep it moving ! '' Similar scenes played out all night . Occasionally , as at Gentlemen 's Barber Spa on Church Street , an entire window would be smashed , and objects would be thrown into the street . But organizers would corral the rest of the crowd , depriving the vandals of cover . `` It 's really frustrating when the protesters get mixed in with the looters , '' said Moses Gardner , 26 . `` It 's really hurtful to the message . People are looking for reasons to discredit the protests . ''
Events in New York and across the country are not taking place in a political vacuum . The presidential election looms large over recent events , just as it has during the coronavirus lockdowns . In an in-depth conversation published here earlier today , Princeton political scientist Omar Wasow discussed his research on how protests in the 1960s influenced elite discourse , public opinion , and the presidential race in 1968 , which Richard Nixon barely won in a three-way contest with Hubert Humphrey and George Wallace . When protesters were nonviolent , he found , they moved public opinion and sympathy in their direction ( the effect was stronger still if law enforcement acted violently against them ) . When protesters acted violently , though , voters recoiled . `` Violent protests likely caused a 1.5–7.9 % shift among whites toward Republicans and tipped the election '' to Nixon , he concludes .
Exactly how his findings map on to today 's situation is n't clear . In New York at least , marches and protests are bumping up against late-night crime sprees and many observers seem willing to conflate the two , either to minimize the looting or to use it to discredit calls for police reform . In 2016 , Donald Trump explicitly invoked Richard Nixon 's calls for `` law and order . '' This time , he is once again running as disciplinary figure . But he 's also the incumbent , meaning that he might well be held responsible for any chaos on his watch . The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden gave a speech yesterday calling out Trump as a racist authoritarian and promising swift criminal justice reforms , but his 44-year career stands as a testament to his own hysterical law-and-order bona fides . From intensifying and expanding the drug war to successfully pushing longer sentences to supporting legislation that gave local police departments access to military gear , Biden has mostly been on the side of law and order himself .
Over the coming weeks and months , we 'll have a better sense of how the protests over racialized police brutality play out and how the leading presidential candidates respond . Exactly how the protesters and the police respond to one another is n't yet clear , but it may well dictate whether police reform happens and who will win the 2020 election .","I live on a short section of Bleecker Street in Manhattan that is in most ways completely unrepresentative of New York City, much less America.

New York's curfew kicks in at 8 p.m. for the rest of the week, in an attempt to put an end to a couple of days of what The Daily Beast's Rachel Olding has described as ""complete anarchy."" Throughout the city on Sunday and Monday nights, Olding documented in her Twitter feed roving bands of mostly young people were breaking into stores and running out with all sorts of merchandise.

Hard to describe how rampant the looting was tonight in Midtown Manhattan and how lawless it was. Complete anarchy. Literally hundreds of stores up and down Broadway, Fifth Ave, Sixth Ave. Kids ruling the streets like it was a party. pic.twitter.com/y9Ly1UD1WX — Rachel Olding (@rachelolding) June 2, 2020

The response of Kith's owners is emblematic of one way of dealing with the new reality in New York: hunker down more and more, worried about chaos. The coronavirus lockdown had been stultifying, but it didn't inspire fear the way the past few nights have. The city's streets had been deserted but they were also peaceful. Now, they are still mostly vacant but the nights are also punctuated by sirens, shouts, and the sounds of breaking glass. Police helicopters patrol the sky, providing a background rumble to the darkness.

In an encouraging sign, last night was calm. There was a massive show of force by the NYPD once the curfew hit and next to no looting. ""Some protesters lingered and looting appeared to lessen with an earlier curfew,"" reports The New York Times. If there is relative calm until the curfew expires at the end of the week, even more of the tension will dissipate.

Anxiety about looting will also fade if there are more events like the one I witnessed yesterday at the other end of my block, where Bleecker meets Bowery. Around 4:30 p.m., a large, long, loud protest march streamed by, headed uptown, with thousands of people chanting, shouting, and making noise. Police were present, restrained, and sometimes smiling, even as the protesters called out law enforcement for killing George Floyd and other misdeeds.

All told, it took about 20 minutes or more for the protesters to pass by, a testament to their number and energy. They were a mix of ages, races, and genders—a Benetton ad for social action and social justice. These probably aren't the same people doing late-night smash-and-grabs at Footlocker stores and CVS pharmacies around the city. Protest organizers seem to be increasingly vigilant about making sure to keep their distance from the more-destructive elements. The Times' account of last night includes this:

As some people banged on windows at two stores at the intersection of Vesey Street and Broadway early on, a young organizer shouted into a microphone, ""Stay calm and peaceful"" and ""Keep it moving!"" Similar scenes played out all night. Occasionally, as at Gentlemen's Barber Spa on Church Street, an entire window would be smashed, and objects would be thrown into the street. But organizers would corral the rest of the crowd, depriving the vandals of cover. ""It's really frustrating when the protesters get mixed in with the looters,"" said Moses Gardner, 26. ""It's really hurtful to the message. People are looking for reasons to discredit the protests.""

Events in New York and across the country are not taking place in a political vacuum. The presidential election looms large over recent events, just as it has during the coronavirus lockdowns. In an in-depth conversation published here earlier today, Princeton political scientist Omar Wasow discussed his research on how protests in the 1960s influenced elite discourse, public opinion, and the presidential race in 1968, which Richard Nixon barely won in a three-way contest with Hubert Humphrey and George Wallace. When protesters were nonviolent, he found, they moved public opinion and sympathy in their direction (the effect was stronger still if law enforcement acted violently against them). When protesters acted violently, though, voters recoiled. ""Violent protests likely caused a 1.5–7.9% shift among whites toward Republicans and tipped the election"" to Nixon, he concludes.

Exactly how his findings map on to today's situation isn't clear. In New York at least, marches and protests are bumping up against late-night crime sprees and many observers seem willing to conflate the two, either to minimize the looting or to use it to discredit calls for police reform. In 2016, Donald Trump explicitly invoked Richard Nixon's calls for ""law and order."" This time, he is once again running as disciplinary figure. But he's also the incumbent, meaning that he might well be held responsible for any chaos on his watch. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden gave a speech yesterday calling out Trump as a racist authoritarian and promising swift criminal justice reforms, but his 44-year career stands as a testament to his own hysterical law-and-order bona fides. From intensifying and expanding the drug war to successfully pushing longer sentences to supporting legislation that gave local police departments access to military gear, Biden has mostly been on the side of law and order himself.

Over the coming weeks and months, we'll have a better sense of how the protests over racialized police brutality play out and how the leading presidential candidates respond. Exactly how the protesters and the police respond to one another isn't yet clear, but it may well dictate whether police reform happens and who will win the 2020 election.",www.reason.com,right,Udonjl7cOvEoNUHR

While that may be anecdotally true , the largest single study of mass shooters ever funded by the U.S. government has found that nearly all mass shooters have four specific things in common .
A new Department of Justice-funded study of all mass shootings — killings of four or more people in a public place — since 1966 found that the shooters typically have an experience with childhood trauma , a personal crisis or specific grievance , and a “ script ” or examples that validate their feelings or provide a roadmap . And then there ’ s the fourth thing : access to a firearm .
The root cause of mass shootings is an intensely partisan debate , with one side blaming mental health and the others blaming guns . Researchers hope that the findings in the study could usher in a more holistic and evidence-based approach to the issue — and provide opportunities for policy action .
“ Data is data , ” said Jillian Peterson , a psychologist at Hamline University and co-author of the study . “ Data isn ’ t political . Our hope is that it pushes these conversations further . ”
The study , compiled by the Violence Project , a nonpartisan think tank dedicated to reducing violence in society , was published Tuesday and is the most comprehensive and detailed database of mass shooters to date , coded to 100 different variables . Its release comes less than a week after a teenage boy killed two students at his high school in Santa Clarita , California , before fatally shooting himself in the head .
The researchers used the FBI ’ s definition of a “ mass murder ” — four or more people killed , excluding the perpetrator — and applied it to shootings in one public place . The dataset stretches back to August 1 , 1966 , when a former Marine opened fire from an observation deck at the University of Texas , killing 15 people . It wasn ’ t the first mass shooting in the U.S. , but researchers chose it as a starting point because it was the first to be substantively covered on radio and TV .
The database delivers a number of arresting findings . Mass shootings are becoming much more frequent and deadly : Of the 167 incidents the researchers logged in that 53-year period , 20 % have occurred in the last five years , and half since 2000 .
They ’ re also increasingly motivated by racial , religious , or misogynist hatred , particularly the ones that occurred in the past five years .
And in an era when tightening gun laws , including background checks , is a national political issue , the study found that more than half of all mass shooters in the database obtained their guns legally .
But researchers said they were particularly struck by how many mass shooters displayed symptoms of being in some sort of crisis prior to the shooting . “ Those are opportunities for prevention , ” said Peterson .
Experts have long cautioned that there is no single profile for a mass shooter . But the Violence Project researchers found some personal characteristics often align with certain types of locations targeted by shooters , and created five general categories :
K-12 shooters : White males , typically students or former students of the school , with a history of trauma . Most are suicidal , plan their crime extensively , and make others aware of their plans at some point before the shooting . They use multiple guns that they typically steal from a family member .
College and university shooters : Non-white males who are current students of the university , are suicidal , and have a history of violence and childhood trauma . They typically use legally obtained handguns and leave behind some sort of manifesto .
Workplace shooters : Fortysomething males without a specific racial profile . Most are employees of their targeted location , often a blue-collar job site , and have some grievance against the workplace . They use legally purchased handguns and assault rifles .
Place of worship shooters : White males in their 40s , typically motivated by hate or domestic violence that spills out into public . Their crimes typically involve little planning .
Shooters at a commercial location ( such as a store or restaurant ) : White men in their 30s with a violent history and criminal record . They typically have no connection to the targeted location and use a single , legally obtained firearm . About a third show evidence of a “ thought disorder , ” a term for a mental health condition , like schizophrenia , that results in disorganized thinking , paranoia , or delusions .
The study shows that the number of shooters who are motivated by racism , religious hate , and misogyny have increased since the 1960s — most dramatically in the last five years .
Since 2015 , hate-fueled shootings targeting black churchgoers in Charleston , Jews at synagogues in Pittsburgh and Poway , women at a yoga studio in Tallahassee , and Latinos at a Walmart in El Paso , have dominated national headlines and added another layer of complexity to the problem of mass violence in America .
READ : A Marine used a neo-Nazi site to recruit for a `` racial holy war . ''
Between 1966 and 2000 , there were 75 mass shootings . Of those , 9 % were motivated by racism , 1 % by religious hatred , and 7 % by misogyny . Of the 32 mass shootings that have occurred in the U.S. just since 2015 , 18 % were motivated by racism , 15 % by religious hatred , and 21 % by misogyny .
The increase in ideologically motivated mass shootings has coincided with the emergence of a newly emboldened far right , who ’ ve forged national and even international alliances of hate online . The sharp rise in misogyny-inspired shootings also squares with the rise of the “ Incels , ” short for “ involuntarily celibate , ” an online subculture comprised of angry young men who deeply resent and blame women for their isolation .
Mental health is a factor — but rarely the cause
Two-thirds of the mass shooters in the database had a documented history of mental health problems . While this seems high , researchers point out that roughly 50 % of Americans have experienced some kind of mental health problem at some point in their lives .
Moreover , the percentage of shooters whose crimes were directly motivated by the symptoms of a mental disorder ( such as delusions or hallucinations caused by psychosis ) is much smaller : roughly 16 % . That is a smaller percentage than shooters motivated by hate , a workplace grievance , or an interpersonal conflict .
“ If someone has a mental health history , I think we ’ ve gotten in the habit of blaming that for their actions , ” said Peterson . “ But someone can have , say , depression , and it ’ s not like everything they do is driven by that . ”
READ : Trump blamed `` mentally ill monsters '' for Dayton and El Paso massacres .
That said , the study found strong links between suicidal motivations and mass shootings . Nearly 70 % of shooters were suicidal before or during the shooting , and the numbers are even higher for school shooters .
These findings could have powerful implications for public policy , according to the researchers . “ This shows us that there are opportunities for intervention — this doesn ’ t just happen out of the blue , ” Peterson said .
“ We know a lot more about suicide prevention than we do about this issue , and we know what works — things like limiting access to weapons , directly asking the question , connecting people with outside resources , not talking about it in the news . ”
The percentage of shooters driven by a desire for fame has risen substantially in the last five years , the study found . In the first 15 years of the 21st century , some 3 % of perpetrators were motivated by the desire to go down in history as a mass shooter .
One specific motivator for fame-seekers remains strangely persistent through the years : the Columbine High School massacre .
There had been many mass shootings and even school shootings before , but Columbine , which took place in 1999 at a public high school in Littleton , Colorado , redefined the school shooting as a media spectacle . The chaotic scene outside the school was broadcast live for several hours before the perpetrators were found to have died by suicide , the shooters left an extensive record of their plans and motives .
READ : Florida woman obsessed with Columbine had 24 pipe bombs .
Columbine ’ s influence is so great that the study even found that fame-seeking as a motive for mass shootings was largely confined to the American West : 70 % of fame-seeking shootings took place in the region . ( By comparison , the researchers found no mass shootings in the Northeast directly motivated by fame-seeking . )
Nearly half the mass shooters in the database purchased their gun legally . Thirteen percent obtained their gun via “ theft , ” which includes borrowing from friends or family members . School shooters — overwhelmingly young — were most likely to acquire their guns in this manner . Researchers said that this particular data point could bolster arguments for legislation requiring safe storage of firearms .
Handguns were by far the most common firearm used in mass shootings , and were used three times the rate of shotguns , rifles , or assault rifles .
Assault rifles were banned in 1994 during the Clinton Administration , but the federal ban expired a decade later and gun manufacturers pounced on the opportunity to re-market military-style firearms to civilians .
Researchers said that there had been a statistically significant increase of assault rifle use in mass shootings in the last five years , which has also coincided with shootings becoming more deadly .","The stereotype of a mass shooter is a white male with a history of mental illness or domestic violence.

The database delivers a number of arresting findings. Mass shootings are becoming much more frequent and deadly: Of the 167 incidents the researchers logged in that 53-year period, 20% have occurred in the last five years, and half since 2000.

They’re also increasingly motivated by racial, religious, or misogynist hatred, particularly the ones that occurred in the past five years.

And in an era when tightening gun laws, including background checks, is a national political issue, the study found that more than half of all mass shooters in the database obtained their guns legally.

But researchers said they were particularly struck by how many mass shooters displayed symptoms of being in some sort of crisis prior to the shooting. “Those are opportunities for prevention,” said Peterson.

5 profiles of mass shooters

Experts have long cautioned that there is no single profile for a mass shooter. But the Violence Project researchers found some personal characteristics often align with certain types of locations targeted by shooters, and created five general categories:

K-12 shooters: White males, typically students or former students of the school, with a history of trauma. Most are suicidal, plan their crime extensively, and make others aware of their plans at some point before the shooting. They use multiple guns that they typically steal from a family member.

College and university shooters: Non-white males who are current students of the university, are suicidal, and have a history of violence and childhood trauma. They typically use legally obtained handguns and leave behind some sort of manifesto.

Workplace shooters: Fortysomething males without a specific racial profile. Most are employees of their targeted location, often a blue-collar job site, and have some grievance against the workplace. They use legally purchased handguns and assault rifles.

Place of worship shooters: White males in their 40s, typically motivated by hate or domestic violence that spills out into public. Their crimes typically involve little planning.

Shooters at a commercial location (such as a store or restaurant): White men in their 30s with a violent history and criminal record. They typically have no connection to the targeted location and use a single, legally obtained firearm. About a third show evidence of a “thought disorder,” a term for a mental health condition, like schizophrenia, that results in disorganized thinking, paranoia, or delusions.

Hate on the rise

The study shows that the number of shooters who are motivated by racism, religious hate, and misogyny have increased since the 1960s — most dramatically in the last five years.

Since 2015, hate-fueled shootings targeting black churchgoers in Charleston, Jews at synagogues in Pittsburgh and Poway, women at a yoga studio in Tallahassee, and Latinos at a Walmart in El Paso, have dominated national headlines and added another layer of complexity to the problem of mass violence in America.

Between 1966 and 2000, there were 75 mass shootings. Of those, 9% were motivated by racism, 1% by religious hatred, and 7% by misogyny. Of the 32 mass shootings that have occurred in the U.S. just since 2015, 18% were motivated by racism, 15% by religious hatred, and 21% by misogyny.

The increase in ideologically motivated mass shootings has coincided with the emergence of a newly emboldened far right, who’ve forged national and even international alliances of hate online. The sharp rise in misogyny-inspired shootings also squares with the rise of the “Incels,” short for “involuntarily celibate,” an online subculture comprised of angry young men who deeply resent and blame women for their isolation.

Mental health is a factor — but rarely the cause

Two-thirds of the mass shooters in the database had a documented history of mental health problems. While this seems high, researchers point out that roughly 50% of Americans have experienced some kind of mental health problem at some point in their lives.

Moreover, the percentage of shooters whose crimes were directly motivated by the symptoms of a mental disorder (such as delusions or hallucinations caused by psychosis) is much smaller: roughly 16%. That is a smaller percentage than shooters motivated by hate, a workplace grievance, or an interpersonal conflict.

“If someone has a mental health history, I think we’ve gotten in the habit of blaming that for their actions,” said Peterson. “But someone can have, say, depression, and it’s not like everything they do is driven by that.”

That said, the study found strong links between suicidal motivations and mass shootings. Nearly 70% of shooters were suicidal before or during the shooting, and the numbers are even higher for school shooters.

These findings could have powerful implications for public policy, according to the researchers. “This shows us that there are opportunities for intervention — this doesn’t just happen out of the blue,” Peterson said.

“We know a lot more about suicide prevention than we do about this issue, and we know what works — things like limiting access to weapons, directly asking the question, connecting people with outside resources, not talking about it in the news.”

Seeking out fame

The percentage of shooters driven by a desire for fame has risen substantially in the last five years, the study found. In the first 15 years of the 21st century, some 3% of perpetrators were motivated by the desire to go down in history as a mass shooter.

Between 2015 and 2019, that number jumped to 12%.

One specific motivator for fame-seekers remains strangely persistent through the years: the Columbine High School massacre.

There had been many mass shootings and even school shootings before, but Columbine, which took place in 1999 at a public high school in Littleton, Colorado, redefined the school shooting as a media spectacle. The chaotic scene outside the school was broadcast live for several hours before the perpetrators were found to have died by suicide, the shooters left an extensive record of their plans and motives.

Columbine’s influence is so great that the study even found that fame-seeking as a motive for mass shootings was largely confined to the American West: 70% of fame-seeking shootings took place in the region. (By comparison, the researchers found no mass shootings in the Northeast directly motivated by fame-seeking.)

How they got their guns

Nearly half the mass shooters in the database purchased their gun legally. Thirteen percent obtained their gun via “theft,” which includes borrowing from friends or family members. School shooters — overwhelmingly young — were most likely to acquire their guns in this manner. Researchers said that this particular data point could bolster arguments for legislation requiring safe storage of firearms.

Handguns were by far the most common firearm used in mass shootings, and were used three times the rate of shotguns, rifles, or assault rifles.

Assault rifles were banned in 1994 during the Clinton Administration, but the federal ban expired a decade later and gun manufacturers pounced on the opportunity to re-market military-style firearms to civilians.

Researchers said that there had been a statistically significant increase of assault rifle use in mass shootings in the last five years, which has also coincided with shootings becoming more deadly.

'Simply having lunch'

The pair began their attack about 11:20 a.m. Sunday, when they opened fire inside the restaurant where Beck, 41, and Soldo, 31, were having lunch.

""I just sat down to have lunch. The officers were sitting in front of me, at the table right next to me, and this man came in out of nowhere,"" a dazed Sheree Burns told CNN affiliate KTNV

The suspects took the officers' guns and ammunition, McMahill told reporters. They ""made a statement -- something to the effect of, 'This is a revolution.' ""

'Suicide pact'

As they walked out, they passed Alvaro Lopez.

""They had a backpack, and I saw a gun in their hand,"" Lopez told CNN affiliate KLAS . ""He just told me to tell the cops that it was a revolution and that he'd just killed two cops inside CiCi's.""

The pair ran to Walmart where Jerad Miller fired off one round and told people to get out, McMahill said.

He continued: ""As soon as he began to confront Jerad Miller with his firearm, Amanda Miller removed her firearm and shot him one time in the ribs area where he immediately collapsed.""

Wilcox, 31, ""died attempting to protect others,"" Gillespie said.

Shoppers rushed toward the exit. Officers converged and exchanged fire with the couple, holding the Millers to the rear of the store.

Critics of New York's bail reform law, including several law enforcement officials, used Harris' case to show how the new law threatened public safety.

In March, the New York Police Department released a report showing that crime in February 2020 had jumped 22.5 percent compared to February 2019. The cops blamed the rise on criminal justice reforms they claimed were too soft on offenders.

In the first 58 days of 2020, 482 people who had been arrested on charges where a cash bail was prohibited went on to commit 846 new crimes.

""Thirty-five percent of the new crimes were for arrests in seven major crime categories - murder, rape, robbery, felony assault, burglary, grand larceny and grand larceny auto - that is nearly triple the amount of those crimes committed in the same 58 days in 2019,"" the report claimed.

Since then, the law has been modified to give judges more discretion in setting bail and other conditions of pretrial release but those effects won't go into effect until July 1.

New York isn't the only place bail policies have been loosened. Since 2012, at least 19 states have moved to reduce the use of financial conditions for a person's release.

In 2018, California became the first jurisdiction to pass a law that ended money bail entirely. Under the law, only people charged with certain low-level, nonviolent misdemeanors would be eligible for automatic release within 12 hours of being booked into jail.

New Jersey decided to replace its cash bail with a scorecard to assess whether a criminal defendant might skip out on his or her hearing. The 2017 change was part of the Criminal Justice Reform Act passed under former Gov. Chris Christie in 2014 and enacted three years later. A 2019 report from the state's Administrative Office of the Courts found that people released under the new system were no more likely to commit a crime while waiting for their trials than those released under the prior system based on money bail.

Alaska and Illinois have put restrictions on the cases in which people can be assigned cash bail. Both states have also encouraged their courts to use ""unsecured"" bail, which is only payable if the person fails to appear in court.

In 2018, Georgia lawmakers passed a bill that requires judges to consider a defendant's financial status when setting bail and allows officers to use citations instead of filing criminal charges. That same year, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu signed off on legislation that would allow low-risk defendants to be released without cash bail.

Marilou Danley , who returned late on Tuesday from a family visit to the Philippines and is regarded by investigators as a “ person of interest , ” said through a lawyer that the carnage Stephen Paddock unleashed while she was abroad caught her completely unaware .
“ He never said anything to me or took any action that I was aware of that I understood in any way to be a warning that something horrible like this was going to happen , ” Danley , 62 , said in a written statement read to reporters by her attorney in Los Angeles , where the FBI was questioning her .
A Federal Bureau of Investigation official in Las Vegas , meanwhile , said no one has been taken into custody .

“ Assuming she had no role in his actions , the most important thing is any light she can shed on Paddock ’ s motive , ” said one official , who spoke about the investigation on condition of anonymity .
Danley said Paddock had bought her an airline ticket to visit her family and wired her money to purchase property there , leading her to worry he might be planning to break up with her .
Paddock ’ s brother Eric told reporters the $ 100,000 transfer was evidence that “ Steve took care of the people he loved , ” and that he likely wanted to protect Danley by sending her overseas before the attack .
She arrived in Manila on Sept. 15 , flew to Hong Kong on Sept. 22 , returned to Manila on Sept. 25 and was there until she flew to Los Angeles on Tuesday night , according to a Philippine immigration official .

( ███ ) - A white man was arrested on Thursday on suspicions he killed nine people at a historic African-American church in South Carolina after sitting with them for an hour of Bible study in an attack U.S. officials are investigating as a hate crime .
The mass shooting set off an intense 14-hour manhunt that ended when 21-year-old Dylann Roof was arrested in a traffic stop about 220 miles ( 350 km ) north of Charleston , South Carolina , where the shooting occurred , officials said .
Wednesday ’ s mass shooting at the almost 200-year-old Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church , comes after a year of turmoil and protests over race relations , policing and criminal justice in the United States . A series of police killings of unarmed black men has sparked a renewed civil rights movement under the “ Black Lives Matter ” banner .
Four pastors , including Democratic state Senator Clementa Pinckney , 41 , were among the six women and three men shot dead at the church nicknamed “ Mother Emanuel , ” which was burned to the ground in the late 1820s after a slave revolt led by one of its founders .
“ The fact that this took place in a black church obviously raises questions about a dark part of our history , ” said U.S. President Barack Obama . “ Once again , innocent people were killed in part because someone who wanted to inflict harm had no trouble getting their hands on a gun . ”
The United States has seen a series of mass shootings in recent years , including the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School , where a gunman killed 20 children and six adults . Democratic efforts to reform the nation ’ s gun laws , protect by the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution , failed after that incident .
A man who identified himself as Carson Cowles , Roof ’ s uncle , told ███ that Roof ’ s father had recently given him a .45-caliber handgun as a birthday present and that Roof had seemed adrift .
“ I don ’ t have any words for it , ” Cowles , 56 , said in a telephone interview . “ Nobody in my family had seen anything like this coming . ”
Roof was armed with a handgun but surrendered peacefully at his arrest , said Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen .
In a Facebook profile apparently belonging to Roof , a portrait showed him wearing a jacket emblazoned with the flags of apartheid-era South Africa and of the former Rhodesia , now Zimbabwe , both formerly ruled by white minorities . Many of his Facebook friends were black .
Roof was arrested on two separate occasions at a shopping mall earlier this year for a drug offense and trespassing , according to court documents .
Roof ’ s mother , Amy , declined to comment when reached by phone .
“ We will be doing no interviews , ever , ” she said before hanging up .
Sylvia Johnson , a cousin of Pinckney , told MSNBC that a survivor told her the gunman reloaded five times during the attack despite pleas for him to stop .
“ He just said , ‘ I have to do it . You rape our women and you ’ re taking over our country , ” Johnson said .

(Reuters) - A white man was arrested on Thursday on suspicions he killed nine people at a historic African-American church in South Carolina after sitting with them for an hour of Bible study in an attack U.S. officials are investigating as a hate crime.

The mass shooting set off an intense 14-hour manhunt that ended when 21-year-old Dylann Roof was arrested in a traffic stop about 220 miles (350 km) north of Charleston, South Carolina, where the shooting occurred, officials said.

Wednesday’s mass shooting at the almost 200-year-old Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, comes after a year of turmoil and protests over race relations, policing and criminal justice in the United States. A series of police killings of unarmed black men has sparked a renewed civil rights movement under the “Black Lives Matter” banner.

Four pastors, including Democratic state Senator Clementa Pinckney, 41, were among the six women and three men shot dead at the church nicknamed “Mother Emanuel,” which was burned to the ground in the late 1820s after a slave revolt led by one of its founders.

“The fact that this took place in a black church obviously raises questions about a dark part of our history,” said U.S. President Barack Obama. “Once again, innocent people were killed in part because someone who wanted to inflict harm had no trouble getting their hands on a gun.”

The United States has seen a series of mass shootings in recent years, including the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, where a gunman killed 20 children and six adults. Democratic efforts to reform the nation’s gun laws, protect by the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, failed after that incident.

GIFT OF A GUN

A man who identified himself as Carson Cowles, Roof’s uncle, told Reuters that Roof’s father had recently given him a .45-caliber handgun as a birthday present and that Roof had seemed adrift.

“I don’t have any words for it,” Cowles, 56, said in a telephone interview. “Nobody in my family had seen anything like this coming.”

Roof was armed with a handgun but surrendered peacefully at his arrest, said Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen.

In a Facebook profile apparently belonging to Roof, a portrait showed him wearing a jacket emblazoned with the flags of apartheid-era South Africa and of the former Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, both formerly ruled by white minorities. Many of his Facebook friends were black.

Roof was arrested on two separate occasions at a shopping mall earlier this year for a drug offense and trespassing, according to court documents.

Roof’s mother, Amy, declined to comment when reached by phone.

“We will be doing no interviews, ever,” she said before hanging up.

Sylvia Johnson, a cousin of Pinckney, told MSNBC that a survivor told her the gunman reloaded five times during the attack despite pleas for him to stop.

“He just said, ‘I have to do it. You rape our women and you’re taking over our country,” Johnson said.

U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said her office was investigating whether to charge Roof with a hate crime motivated by racial or other prejudice.

Under federal and some state laws, such crimes typically carry harsher penalties, but South Carolina is one of just five U.S. states not to have a hate-crimes law.

Three people survived the attack.

San Francisco is one of dozens of cities, counties and states across the country that have laws, policies or regulations that prevent employees from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement efforts.

Here's some information about sanctuary cities and the debate surrounding them:

What is a sanctuary city?

There's no legal definition of a sanctuary city, county or state, and what it means varies from place to place. But jurisdictions that fall under that controversial term -- supporters oppose it -- generally have policies or laws that limit the extent to which law enforcement and other government employees will go to assist the federal government on immigration matters.

Some communities use nonbinding resolutions, executive orders, police department policies or orders, while others use laws to enforce such policies, according to the Congressional Research Service

In San Francisco, for instance, a 1989 law called the City and County of Refuge ordinance prohibits city employees from helping federal immigration enforcement efforts unless compelled by court order or state law.

How many are there?

More than 200 state and local jurisdictions have policies that call for not honoring U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention requests, the agency's director, Sarah Saldana, told Congress in March.

What's their history?

The sanctuary movement is said to have grown out of efforts by churches in the 1980s to provide sanctuary to Central Americans fleeing violence at home amid reluctance by the federal government to grant them refugee status.

It's also a product of the long-running national immigration debate, in which officials in some more diverse and liberal communities sometimes take issue with aggressive immigration enforcement efforts.

What's the argument for sanctuary status?

Proponents say that by encouraging members of immigrant communities to work with police without fear of deportation, such policies help authorities improve public safety by helping authorities identify and arrest dangerous criminals who might otherwise go undetected.

""I firmly believe it makes us safer,"" San Francisco Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi told CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper."" ""We're a world-renowned city with a large immigrant population. ... From a law enforcement perspective, we want to build trust with that population.""

Supporters say such policies are widely supported by police groups such as the International Association of Chiefs of Police and chiefs from the nation's largest police departments because they help communities unite to fight crime.

What do critics say?

""Unfortunately, a lot of cities in this country have decided they don't want to cooperate with ICE,"" Julie Myers Wood, former assistant secretary for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told CNN on Monday. ""They think that cooperating with ICE causes them problems with respect to the immigrant community and public safety, but in fact it does exactly the opposite, as we've seen here.""

Such policies ""ignore the fact that if the illegal aliens were removed from the U.S., they would not be here to become victims, and the predators would be out of the country, too,"" Ohio Jobs & Justice PAC, which opposes sanctuary policies, says on its website.

""Sanctuary policies -- official or otherwise, result in safe havens (or safer havens) for illegal aliens involved in a variety of criminal enterprises -- since their illegal schemes are less likely to be uncovered and face less risk of deportation if caught by local law enforcement,"" the website says.

""Sanctuary policies also provide an environment helpful to Latin American drug cartels, gangs, and terrorist cells -- since their activities are less likely to be detected and reported by law enforcement.""

Some Republican presidential candidates have used similar language. Donald Trump has blamed immigration policy for Kate Steinle 's death. Another Republican, Jeb Bush, agreed, saying such policies encourage such crimes.

What has the federal government said?

In March, Saldana, the ICE director, drew heat from immigrant rights supporters after appearing at a congressional hearing to endorse efforts to rein in the sanctuary movement.

In written testimony submitted to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Saldana said that a significant factor affecting efforts to deport undocumented immigrants ""has been the increase in state and local jurisdictions that are limiting their partnership, or wholly refusing to cooperate, with ICE immigration enforcement efforts.""

""While the reasons for this may vary, including state and local legislative restrictions and judicial findings of state and local liability, in certain circumstances we believe less cooperation may increase the risk that dangerous criminals are returned to the streets, putting the public and our officers at greater risk,"" she said.

Some Democrats encourage aggressive public confrontations against Trump, aides",2018-06-24,"Dave Boyer, Valerie Richardson","The refusal of a Virginia restaurant owner to serve White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders is the latest incident in the escalating public hostility directed at President Trump and his aides , raising concerns among some conservatives about the potential for partisan-inspired violence .
Leading Democrats largely failed to condemn the actions of the Red Hen restaurant in Lexington , Virginia , where owner Stephanie Wilkinson asked Mrs. Sanders to leave Friday night because her liberal staff detests the administration and didn ’ t want to serve her party .
Mrs. Sanders agreed to leave , saying of the restaurant owner later on Twitter , “ Her actions say far more about her than about me . ”
The incident has sparked outrage among Trump supporters as another example of intolerance on the left and increasingly aggressive partisan confrontation , especially in the wake of the president ’ s rescinded policy on separating illegal immigrant children from their parents .
Possible 2020 Democratic presidential contenders Joseph R. Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have done little to discourage the hostile rhetoric . Ms. Warren has accused the president of “ taking America to a dark and ugly place , ” and at least one of her colleagues went further , calling for total social ostracism and perpetual public confrontations .
In recent days , Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen has been heckled and booed at a Mexican restaurant by activists and faced demonstrators outside her home . White House senior adviser Stephen Miller was called a “ real-life fascist ” by another patron at a Mexican restaurant in Washington .

An openly gay Democratic Pennsylvania legislator greeted Vice President Mike Pence ’ s visit to Philadelphia on Thursday by posting an Instagram photo of himself giving the middle finger to Mr. Pence . “ Get bent , then get out ! ” wrote state Rep. Brian Sims of Philadelphia .
Hollywood is encouraging the public nastiness . Actor Robert De Niro got a standing ovation at the Tony Awards this month for saying onstage at Radio City Music Hall : “ F– Trump. ” Actor Peter Fonda called for the president ’ s 12-year-old son , Barron , to be “ thrown into a cage with pedophiles. ” He later apologized .

Actor Tom Arnold vowed to protest at the school attended by the children of presidential daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump and her husband , Jared Kushner .
Trump allies say liberals are increasingly targeting administration officials with open hostility because minority-party Democrats can ’ t stop the administration ’ s policies in Congress .
“ The increasing personal nastiness toward people who work for President Trump reflects the left ’ s understanding that they are losing , ” tweeted former House Speaker Newt Gingrich . “ Nastiness reflects desperation , not strength . They can ’ t win the argument , so they use nastiness . Sad and dangerous . ”
Rush Limbaugh worried aloud on his syndicated show that the increasingly hostile rhetoric and confrontations are heading toward violence . He blamed the media for what he called incendiary coverage of the family separation issue at the border .
“ If the media keeps this up — if they keep up generating this hysteria — somebody ’ s going to get killed , ” Mr. Limbaugh said on his show . “ I think we ’ re pretty close to somebody getting killed already , and I ’ m not being hyperbolic , and I ’ m not trying to call attention to myself . I ’ m genuinely worried about the out-of-control aspect of this . The news media ’ s fanning the flames . ”
The episode that may have crystalized the extent of the partisan animosity came not at the gates of the White House but in bucolic Lexington , Virginia , a historic town of about 7,000 that is a three-hour drive outside the Beltway in the Shenandoah Valley .
Mrs. Sanders sat down to dinner there around 8 p.m. Friday with her husband , Brian , and several others at the Red Hen , a cozy , 26-seat restaurant known for its farm-to-table menu .
Shortly after Mrs. Sanders and her group arrived , a restaurant employee called the owner at her home nearby to complain about the White House staffer ’ s presence . Ms. Wilkinson drove to the restaurant , huddled with her staff , pulled Mrs. Sanders aside and asked her to leave .
“ I was babbling a little , but I got my point across in a polite and direct fashion , ” Ms. Wilkinson told The Washington Post . “ I explained that the restaurant has certain standards that I feel it has to uphold , such as honesty and compassion and cooperation . I said , ‘ I ’ d like to ask you to leave , ’ ” and Ms. Sanders didn ’ t hesitate , replying , ‘ That ’ s fine . I ’ ll go . ’ ”
The restaurant owner said she would do the same thing all over again .
“ We just felt there are moments in time when people need to live their convictions . This appeared to be one , ” she said .
She said several of her employees are gay , and she cited the press secretary ’ s work for the “ inhumane and unethical ” Trump administration .
“ I ’ m not a huge fan of confrontation , ” Ms. Wilkinson said . “ I have a business , and I want the business to thrive . This feels like the moment in our democracy when people have to make uncomfortable actions and decisions to uphold their morals . ”
After a flurry of news reports based on a waiter ’ s account on Facebook , Mrs. Sanders confirmed Saturday that she agreed to leave after being confronted by the owner .
“ I was told by the owner of Red Hen in Lexington , VA to leave because I work for @ POTUS and I politely left , ” she tweeted . “ Her actions say far more about her than about me . I always do my best to treat people , including those I disagree with , respectfully and will continue to do so . ”
The Red Hen , which is not affiliated with the Red Hen restaurant in the District of Columbia , was promptly “ Yelp-bombed ” as thousands of commentators went online to post politically motivated one- and five-star reviews based on the Sanders incident .
The Red Hen ’ s Facebook page and Twitter account were also deluged with comments including “ Thank you for standing up to the fascists ” to “ Nobody wants to eat at a place that bases service on politics . ”
Lexington voted for Hillary Clinton by a 2-1 margin in the 2016 presidential election , while surrounding Rockbridge County voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Trump . It is home to the Virginia Military Institute and Washington and Lee University .
Mrs. Sanders ‘ father , former Arkansas Gov . Mike Huckabee , tweeted of the incident , “ Bigotry . On the menu at Red Hen Restaurant in Lexington VA. Or you can ask for the ‘ Hate Plate. ’ And appetizers are ‘ small plates for small minds . ’ ”
Mr. Huckabee received heavy criticism on the left over the weekend for tweeting a photo of MS-13 gang members with the comment , “ Nancy Pelosi introduces her campaign committee for the take back of the House . ”
Some said the confrontation at the Red Hen was evidence that political discourse in the U.S. has crossed an extreme line .
Ari Fleischer , who served as press secretary for President George W. Bush , tweeted Saturday : “ I guess we ’ re heading into an America with Democrat-only restaurants , which will lead to Republican-only restaurants . Do the fools who threw Sarah out , and the people who cheer them on , really want us to be that kind of country ? ”
Rep. Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland , a frequent critic of the Trump administration , was one of the few Democrats to speak out against the restaurant owner ’ s actions .
“ I think the restaurant owner should have served her . I really do , ” Mr. Cummings said on CBS-TV ’ s “ Face the Nation . ”
At the same time , he blamed the increasingly vicious political climate in large part on Mr. Trump .
“ This tone is horrible , ” Mr. Cummings said . “ I think President Trump has created this . Since he ’ s become president and even before , he ’ s basically given people license to state things that are ugly , and those things then turn into actions , as we can now see . ”
However , Rep. Maxine Waters , California Democrat , took a different tack and called for more public confrontations . She told a cheering crowd that Trump administration officials should not be allowed anywhere in public .
“ Let ’ s stay the course , let ’ s make sure we show up wherever we have to show up , ” she said at a speech , the video of which was posted Sunday on social media . “ If you see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant , in a department store , at a gasoline station , you get out and you create a crowd and you push back on them , and you tell them they ’ re not welcome anymore , anywhere . ”
Rep. Barbara Lee , California Democrat , said Mrs. Sanders should be reported to the Office of Government Ethics for tweeting about a private business on her government Twitter account .
“ If you use a government account to attack a private business on personal time , I mean , that ’ s not right , ” she said on CNN ’ s “ State of the Union . ”
Democrats routinely blame Mr. Trump for lowering the public discourse through his name-calling of political adversaries , including Ms. Warren ( “ Pocahontas ” ) and former Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter ( “ a crude dope ” ) .
Former CIA Director Michael V. Hayden even compared the family separation issue to death camps in Nazi Germany . That brought a rebuke from others , including University of Pennsylvania history professor Jonathan Zimmerman , writing at SFChronicle.com .
“ If I engage in the same violent and irresponsible rhetoric as Donald Trump , I ’ m not ‘ resisting ’ him , ” Mr. Zimmerman wrote . “ To the contrary , I ’ m going into the muck with him . That ’ s not resistance ; it ’ s capitulation . ”
Public anger directed at Mr. Trump and top administration officials is increasing as the White House proposes to assign protection duties for Cabinet-level officials to the already stretched-thin U.S . Marshals Service . The Office of Management and Budget announced the plan Thursday as part of a proposed major overhaul of the federal government , including the merger of some Cabinet agencies .
Marshals around the country were alerted in a memo on Wednesday that the service was preparing for the move .
“ Consolidate protective details at certain civilian Executive Branch agencies under the US Marshals Service in order to more effectively and efficiently monitor and respond to potential threats , ” stated the White House ’ s recommendation . “ Threat assessments would be conducted with support from the U.S. Secret Service . ”
Rep. Bob Goodlatte , Virginia Republican , invited Mrs. Sanders back to Lexington , saying the rude reception she received at the Red Hen restaurant didn ’ t reflect the “ kind and caring people ” of his 6th Congressional District .
“ What @ PressSec experienced in Lexington [ Friday ] night is very unfortunate and doesn ’ t reflect accurately upon the kind and caring people of Lexington that I know , ” tweeted Mr. Goodlatte . “ There are many great innovative businesses in # VA06 that I hope you ’ ll come to back to visit . ”","The refusal of a Virginia restaurant owner to serve White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders is the latest incident in the escalating public hostility directed at President Trump and his aides, raising concerns among some conservatives about the potential for partisan-inspired violence.

The shootings that left at least three civilians and one police officer dead Tuesday in Jersey City , N.J. , was a targeted attack , according to local authorities . Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop explained Wednesday that the pair of shooters , who were also killed , had clearly singled out the kosher market on which they opened fire .
`` At the time of the incident yesterday , it was difficult to understand intent , and there 's still a lot of questions around that . But after reviewing the [ closed-circuit TV ] cameras on the Jersey City side , we do feel comfortable that it was a targeted attack on the Jewish kosher deli across the street here , '' Fulop told reporters during a morning snowstorm , gesturing at a storefront crowded with emergency personnel .
Six people died in Tuesday 's attacks , including the suspects : David N. Anderson , 47 , and Francine Graham , 50 .
New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal identified the shooters at a joint news conference with other law enforcement leaders Wednesday afternoon . He said Anderson and Graham killed Detective Joseph Seals , 39 , during an encounter near Bayview Cemetery prior to the main shootout .
`` Thereafter , at approximately 12:21 p.m. , a white U-Haul van driven by Mr. Anderson parked directly across the street from the JC Kosher supermarket , which is approximately 1 mile from the cemetery , '' Grewal said .
`` Within seconds of arriving , Mr. Anderson exited the driver 's side door of the U-Haul with a rifle in his hand . He walked towards the JC Kosher supermarket and immediately began shooting . Ms. Graham , the passenger in the van , followed Mr. Anderson into the store . ''
Four people were inside the supermarket at the time , according to the attorney general . One escaped with gunshot wounds . The three others died . Grewal identified them as : Mindel Ferencz , who is in her early 30s ; Moshe Deutsch , 24 ; and Miguel Douglas , 49 .
The ensuing standoff between suspects and police lasted about three hours , before a police armored vehicle broke into the storefront and officers discovered the shooters ' bodies inside .
Afterwards , authorities say they recovered a pipe bomb and `` numerous firearms '' from the scene .
The vehicle used by Anderson and Graham `` was searched by our state police professionals forensically . They did locate in that , amongst other items that I wo n't be discussing , a pipe bomb — improvised explosive device , '' FBI Special Agent in Charge Gregory Ehrie told reporters .
`` It was a viable device , meaning it could be a device that would have exploded . It was , again , a pipe bomb by design — not complicated , but sophisticated in the sense that time and effort went into creating it , '' Ehrie said .
In statement released Wednesday , Rabbi David Niederman mourned Ferencz and Deutsch as prominent members of the local Jewish community .
`` Of course , we 'll collect ourselves and go on with our lives . At the same time , we ca n't let the horrible hate go on and threaten us . It 's too late already . The hate that springs up all over now cut short lives so close to home , '' said Niederman , the president of the United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburg and North Brooklyn .
`` But we have to act now so that we do n't have to mourn precious lives in the future , '' he said .
At his news conference , Fulop said there likely would have been more victims if two police officers nearby had not responded quickly after hearing the gunshots while they were on patrol one block away .
`` From what we can tell on the CCTV cameras , had they not responded — and had they not been there in that location — more than likely more people would have died , '' Fulop said . `` The reason that those perpetrators seemed to be inside of that deli , and not able to move potentially to the school or to inflict more harm , was because the police responded immediately and returned fire .

Both officers sustained gunshot wounds in the exchange of fire , according to James Shea , the public safety director in Jersey City , just across the Hudson River from Manhattan .

`` When you look at the facts of what transpired yesterday , it 's difficult to argue anything other than that . We know that they traveled over a mile of deliberately and slowly to this location .

The shootings that left at least three civilians and one police officer dead Tuesday in Jersey City, N.J., was a targeted attack, according to local authorities. Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop explained Wednesday that the pair of shooters, who were also killed, had clearly singled out the kosher market on which they opened fire.

""At the time of the incident yesterday, it was difficult to understand intent, and there's still a lot of questions around that. But after reviewing the [closed-circuit TV] cameras on the Jersey City side, we do feel comfortable that it was a targeted attack on the Jewish kosher deli across the street here,"" Fulop told reporters during a morning snowstorm, gesturing at a storefront crowded with emergency personnel.

Six people died in Tuesday's attacks, including the suspects: David N. Anderson, 47, and Francine Graham, 50.

New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal identified the shooters at a joint news conference with other law enforcement leaders Wednesday afternoon. He said Anderson and Graham killed Detective Joseph Seals, 39, during an encounter near Bayview Cemetery prior to the main shootout.

""Thereafter, at approximately 12:21 p.m., a white U-Haul van driven by Mr. Anderson parked directly across the street from the JC Kosher supermarket, which is approximately 1 mile from the cemetery,"" Grewal said.

""Within seconds of arriving, Mr. Anderson exited the driver's side door of the U-Haul with a rifle in his hand. He walked towards the JC Kosher supermarket and immediately began shooting. Ms. Graham, the passenger in the van, followed Mr. Anderson into the store.""

Four people were inside the supermarket at the time, according to the attorney general. One escaped with gunshot wounds. The three others died. Grewal identified them as: Mindel Ferencz, who is in her early 30s; Moshe Deutsch, 24; and Miguel Douglas, 49.

In statement released Wednesday, Rabbi David Niederman mourned Ferencz and Deutsch as prominent members of the local Jewish community.

He is yet another mass shooter among that many who did not live full time with his dad — a trend that appears to be especially strong among school shooters. If you expand the “mass shooter” category to include drug and gang-related violence in the inner city, the fatherless connection becomes even clearer. In Baltimore, where violence is infamously rampant, fewer than 20 percent of all teens are being raised by married parents.

'' As we 've seen over the past few days , regardless of whether it 's created for military purposes , this gear tends to eventually end up on the streets of the United States .
In Ferguson this week the police used one of these new weapons , the LRAD , also known as a sound cannon . These were developed fairly recently as an interdiction device to repel pirates or terrorists in the aftermath of the attack on the USS Cole . But their use as a weapon to disperse crowds quickly became obvious . In Ferguson it seems to have served mostly as a warning device , but it can cause substantial pain and hearing damage if it 's deployed with the intent to send crowds running in the opposite direction . It 's been used liberally by police departments for the past few years , even at such benign public gatherings as a sand castle competition in San Diego , California . The police chief ( as it happens , the former FBI agent in charge at the Ruby Ridge standoff ) explained that it was there in case they needed it . Evidently , San Diego takes its sand castle competitions very seriously .
But the LRAD is a toy compared to some of the other weapons the military industrial complex has been developing to deal with `` crowd control . '' Take Shockwave , the new electric shock weapon developed by Taser International , a sort of taser machine gun :
The cartridges are tethered by 25-foot wires , which can be fired from a distance of up to 100 meters in a 20-degree arc . The “ probes ” on the end of the cartridges can pierce through clothing and skin , emitting 50,000 volts of electricity in the process . “ Full area coverage is provided to instantaneously incapacitate multiple personnel within that region ” Taser explains . “ Multiple Shockwave units can be stacked together ( like building blocks ) either horizontally or vertically in order to extend area coverage or vertically to allow for multiple salvo engagements. ” The product description states . The weapons can also be vehicle mounted or “ daisy chained ” according to Taser . Clearly it is anticipated that these things will be used on sizable crowds , meaning an increased likelihood of indiscriminate targeting .
The Department of Defense touts the use of these weapons as battlefield devices , but considering the huge market for military gear among police forces , it 's fairly obvious that they have been developed for domestic use as well . You can watch a demonstration of the device here . You 'll note the demo opens with the question : `` What if you could drop everyone in a given area to the ground with the push of a button ? '' ( They leave out the part where they are all screaming and writhing in terrible pain ... )
And then there 's Taser 's new shotgun style taser called the XREP ( for Extended Range External Projectile ) .It has the advantage of being able to be shot from a real gun and it delivers 20 long excruciating seconds of unbearable pain as opposed to the wimpy 5 seconds of the regular taser -- - which kills people with regularity . ( You can see a demonstration of that one here . ) The Taser drone is still in development but it 's sure to be a very welcome addition to the electroshock weapon arsenal .
If we believe , as Joe Scarborough does , that citizens are required to instantly comply with police regardless of the situation , these devices are perfect enforcement tools . On the other hand , if you believe that citizens have a right to peacefully protest and that police are not automatically entitled to deference in all circumstances , then you might want to think twice about the use of these weapons . They are only barely better than allowing police to shoot into crowds with bullets . Tasers can kill people and cause them to badly injure themselves and they are far too easy for police to use indiscriminately since the public has been brainwashed into believing they are harmless .
But there 's more . The military has been developing something called the Active Denial System , also known as the Pentagon 's Ray Gun . `` 60 Minutes '' did a laudatory story on it a few years back in which it showed the training exercises the Army was using to test the weapon for potential use in Iraq . The funny thing was that the exercises featured soldiers dressed as protesters carrying signs that said `` world peace , '' `` love for all , '' which the `` 60 Minutes '' correspondent characterized as something soldiers might confront in Iraq . ( Who knew there was a large contingent of American-style hippies in Iraq staging antiwar protests ? ) The weapon itself is something out of science fiction : It 's a beam of electromagnetic radiation that heats the skin to a painful 130 degrees allegedly without inflicting permanent damage . They claim there have been almost no side effects or injuries . It just creates terrible pain and panics the peaceniks into dispersing on command . What could be better than that ? Imagine how great it would be if any time a crowd gathers and the government wants to shut it down , they can just zap it with heat and send everyone screaming in agony and running in the opposite direction .
In his thorough Harper 's investigation on this subject , reporter Ando Arike explained the purpose behind all these new technologies :
[ We have ] an international arms-development effort involving an astonishing range of technologies : electrical weapons that shock and stun ; laser weapons that cause dizziness or temporary blindness ; acoustic weapons that deafen and nauseate ; chemical weapons that irritate , incapacitate , or sedate ; projectile weapons that knock down , bruise , and disable ; and an assortment of nets , foams , and sprays that obstruct or immobilize . “ Non-lethal ” is the Pentagon ’ s approved term for these weapons , but their manufacturers also use the terms “ soft kill , ” “ less-lethal , ” “ limited effects , ” “ low collateral damage , ” and “ compliance. ” The weapons are intended primarily for use against unarmed or primitively armed civilians ; they are designed to control crowds , clear buildings and streets , subdue and restrain individuals , and secure borders . The result is what appears to be the first arms race in which the opponent is the general population .
As I wrote earlier , in a couple of weeks the Soft-kill Convention , also known as Urban Shield , will be holding its annual trade show in Oakland , California . Police agencies from all over the world will attend to try out the various types of modern weapons that will be on display there . The super high-tech weapons described above are probably some years away from the commercial market . But it 's highly likely they will make their way to the police eventually through one of the many ways the weapons manufacturers manage to put this equipment in the hands of civilian authorities -- if the federal government continues to make money available for that purpose .
Hopefully , Ferguson has alerted the public to the danger to our civil rights and liberties brought by the federal government arming police forces to the teeth with military gear . But it 's going to take vigilance to ensure that the next time we see civil unrest and peaceful protests on the streets of America , the authorities wo n't be responding with electroshock or laser weapons or electromagnetic radiation devices designed purely for the purpose of gaining instant compliance from people in a crowd . If Americans foolishly accept these weapons as an improvement on the harsher methods we might see today there is a grave danger that we will be giving authorities much more power to quell dissent . In a free society it should n't be easy to quell dissent . If it is , that society wo n't be free for very long .","Now that the sight of American police decked out as if they are replaying the events of Blackhawk Down has alerted the American public to the militarization of our police agencies, perhaps they will finally be receptive to the warnings that some of us have been making for years about the next generation of weapons that are being developed for ""crowd control.""

violence_in_america,USA TODAY,1,http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/12/04/phoenix-police-unarmed-man-killed-by-officer/19878931/,Unarmed black man killed by white Phoenix officer,2014-12-04,,"PHOENIX — The facts surrounding Rumain Brisbon 's death — the ones that could be agreed upon as of Wednesday evening — follow a narrative familiar to a nation still reeling from the racially charged police incidents in Ferguson , Mo. , New York City and elsewhere .
In Phoenix on Tuesday evening , a white police officer who was feeling threatened used lethal force on an unarmed black man . The incident left the officer unharmed and Brisbon , 34 , dead with two bullet wounds in his torso at a north Phoenix apartment complex .
Phoenix police quickly released a detailed account of the killing for the media on Wednesday morning in what officials said was an effort to promote transparency , especially in light of the unrest that has played out in Ferguson and New York City following the deaths of unarmed black men at the hands of white officers . But portions of that account have already been challenged by some witnesses and community activists who say that the officer 's use of force was excessive and that Brisbon 's death was unwarranted .
Shortly before 6 p.m. MT on Tuesday , officers were in the area of Interstate 17 and Greenway Road for a burglary investigation when a resident of an apartment complex told them that men inside a black Cadillac SUV were engaged in a drug deal , said Sgt . Trent Crump , a Phoenix police spokesman .
Police checked the license plate that the tipster provided and found it was registered to a resident in the 15400 block of North 25th Avenue , where there was also a pending report of a `` loud music disturbance . ''
The loud-music call was canceled , so the officer went to the SUV to ask questions of those inside , Crump said .
The officer said the driver , later identified as Brisbon , got out and appeared to be removing something from the rear of the SUV . The officer told Brisbon to show his hands , but Brisbon stuffed his hands into his waistband , Crump said .
The officer drew his weapon and Brisbon ran toward nearby apartments , Crump said . A short foot chase ensued .
`` Witnesses indicated to us that the suspect was verbally challenging to the officer , '' Crump said .
Brisbon refused to comply with the officer 's commands to get on the ground , and the two struggled once the officer caught up with him , Crump said .
`` During the struggle , Brisbon put his left hand in his pocket and the officer grabbed onto the suspect 's hand , while repeatedly telling the suspect to keep his hand in his pocket , '' he said . `` The officer believed he felt the handle of a gun while holding the suspect 's hand in his pocket . ''
A woman inside an apartment opened a door at that moment , and the officer and Brisbon tumbled inside , Crump said . Two children , ages 9 and 2 , were in a back bedroom , he said .
The officer could no longer keep a grip on Brisbon 's hand and , because he feared that the suspect had a gun in his pocket , fired two shots , Crump said .

PHOENIX — The facts surrounding Rumain Brisbon's death — the ones that could be agreed upon as of Wednesday evening — follow a narrative familiar to a nation still reeling from the racially charged police incidents in Ferguson, Mo., New York City and elsewhere.

In Phoenix on Tuesday evening, a white police officer who was feeling threatened used lethal force on an unarmed black man. The incident left the officer unharmed and Brisbon, 34, dead with two bullet wounds in his torso at a north Phoenix apartment complex.

Phoenix police quickly released a detailed account of the killing for the media on Wednesday morning in what officials said was an effort to promote transparency, especially in light of the unrest that has played out in Ferguson and New York City following the deaths of unarmed black men at the hands of white officers. But portions of that account have already been challenged by some witnesses and community activists who say that the officer's use of force was excessive and that Brisbon's death was unwarranted.

Shortly before 6 p.m. MT on Tuesday, officers were in the area of Interstate 17 and Greenway Road for a burglary investigation when a resident of an apartment complex told them that men inside a black Cadillac SUV were engaged in a drug deal, said Sgt. Trent Crump, a Phoenix police spokesman.

Police checked the license plate that the tipster provided and found it was registered to a resident in the 15400 block of North 25th Avenue, where there was also a pending report of a ""loud music disturbance.""

The loud-music call was canceled, so the officer went to the SUV to ask questions of those inside, Crump said.

The officer said the driver, later identified as Brisbon, got out and appeared to be removing something from the rear of the SUV. The officer told Brisbon to show his hands, but Brisbon stuffed his hands into his waistband, Crump said.

The officer drew his weapon and Brisbon ran toward nearby apartments, Crump said. A short foot chase ensued.

""Witnesses indicated to us that the suspect was verbally challenging to the officer,"" Crump said.

Brisbon refused to comply with the officer's commands to get on the ground, and the two struggled once the officer caught up with him, Crump said.

""During the struggle, Brisbon put his left hand in his pocket and the officer grabbed onto the suspect's hand, while repeatedly telling the suspect to keep his hand in his pocket,"" he said. ""The officer believed he felt the handle of a gun while holding the suspect's hand in his pocket.""

A woman inside an apartment opened a door at that moment, and the officer and Brisbon tumbled inside, Crump said. Two children, ages 9 and 2, were in a back bedroom, he said.

The officer could no longer keep a grip on Brisbon's hand and, because he feared that the suspect had a gun in his pocket, fired two shots, Crump said.

The item in Brisbon's pocket turned out to be a bottle of oxycodone pills, he said.

Crump said the officers are aware of the delicate nature of the case and are asking the community to allow investigators to gather all the facts.

""I would like to think that in our officer-involved shootings, that we are transparent as we can be as an organization,"" Crump said. ""We always have been and always will be concerned about what it is that our residents think about our role in this community and the levels of force that we use.

""Let's be very clear: The officer was doing what we expect him to do, which is investigate crimes that neighbors are telling him are occurring in that part of the complex.""

Crump said the department was not identifying the officer, a 30-year-old with seven years on the force.

He also acknowledged that, as in most police investigations, witness accounts varied.

Martin Rangel lives upstairs from where the shooting occurred and said he heard some banging and then a gunshot.

""It was so loud, I heard the vibration through the floor,"" Rangel said. ""I ran to the window, and that's when I saw the cop running out, or like, walking out, and he was cussing, you know, he was screaming, 'F--k, f--k,' like upset that he shot the guy.""

Brandon Dickerson, who said he was in the car with Brisbon shortly before the shooting and witnessed some of the incident, said Brisbon was dropping off fast food to his children in the apartment. On Wednesday evening, strewn french fries still littered the front porch.

Dickerson said he never saw the officer try to talk with Brisbon. He also said his friend wasn't yelling at the officer.

""Who's gonna argue with police?"" Dickerson said. ""He had no death wish yesterday.""

Marci Kratter, a Phoenix attorney who represented Brisbon in a previous DUI case and is now representing his family, said she is concerned that the story offered by police is not complete.

""There are numerous witnesses that will challenge the police officer's account of what transpired,"" she said.

Kratter said she dispatched investigators to the scene to determine whether a civil wrongful-death suit is necessary.

""Tonight, four children are missing their father, a woman is missing her husband and a mother is missing her son,"" she said. ""It was a senseless tragedy. He was unarmed and not a threat to anyone. We intend to pursue this to the full extent of the law.""

Civil rights activist Jarrett Maupin was at the scene Wednesday and said he spoke with Brisbon's family members.

""I think the statements given to me by neighbors, friends and family members are in direct contrast to what has been disseminated by the Phoenix Police Department,"" he said.

Court records show that while Brisbon was serving a five-year probation sentence stemming from a 1998 burglary conviction,he spent several months in the hospital after being shot. Details of the shooting were not immediately available, but court records state that he had been on ""a self-destructive path due to his emotional state"" after the shooting.

Records show that Brisbon was booked on suspicion of driving under the influence twice in 2009 and once in October. He also had a marijuana conviction.

Officer-involved shootings are not uncommon, but the events that transpired in Ferguson, Mo., in August triggered a national debate about lethal police force and whether it too often crosses the line in minority communities.

The Aug. 9 death of Michael Brown, an unarmed man, sparked riots in Ferguson and protests nationwide. Darren Wilson, the White officer who shot him, was not indicted.

Then, on Wednesday, it was announced that a white officer would not be indicted in the chokehold death of Eric Garner, who was allegedly selling loose cigarettes on Staten Island.

Karl Gentles, a local leader in the black community and public policy chairman of the Greater Phoenix Black Chamber of Commerce, said there is clearly a concern in Phoenix, as well as nationwide, that justice is not being served in defense of the African-American community.

violence_in_america,The Jerusalem Post,1,https://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Inconvenient-antisemitism-The-daily-attacks-on-Jews-in-New-York-612420,Inconvenient antisemitism: The daily attacks on Jews in New York,,,"The attack on a Rabbi in Monsey north of New York City on Saturday evening has left the Jewish community shaken . It follows at least eight other attacks in New York since the shooting attack on a kosher supermarket in early December . There have been near daily attacks in New York City this year , a kind of slow-moving pogrom against Jews , particularly targeting ultra-Orthodox Jews.The murder of three people at a kosher supermarket in Jersey City was mostly ignored in the United States . No rallies or marches against the antisemitism that led to it . No major political upheavals or even much recognition . The usual anger over gun violence after mass shootings was nowhere to be found . The victims and the perpetrators are inconvenient . America as a whole can ’ t mourn Orthodox Jews and it can ’ t confront perpetrators when the perpetrators come from a minority community . This is inconvenient antisemitism and it is a kind of antisemitism privilege . Despite widespread anti-racism programs in the US , there are still those in America for whom being antisemitic is a birthright and not something to be ashamed of . The number of people raised with violent antisemitic beliefs is growing.The Jersey City murders are the culmination of years of incitement against Jews . But the perpetrators in that case were themselves minorities from the African American community . The perpetrators have been identified as coming from an extremist religious group called Black Hebrew Israelites , making them a minority of a minority . The perpetrators are seen as a “ militant ” fringe within that minority.The authorities are now looking at the case as domestic terrorism fueled by antisemitism . However major media have endeavored to dismiss the murders as unimportant and unique . The New York Times described the Black Hebrew Israelites as being “ known for their inflammatory sidewalk ministers who employ provocation as a form of gospel. ” It ’ s a bit more than that . In fact , the group and the milieu around it tend to view religion through a racial lens , such that Jews are described as “ white ” and “ fake ” and the “ real Jews ” are portrayed as black , along with all the prophets and religious figures . The ADL pointed out that this group views itself as the real “ chosen people ” and that it sees people of color as the real descendants of the 12 tribes . The group was in the media earlier in the year in Washington DC when they shouted insults at Catholic high school students.Mainstream society wants to view this as “ provocation , ” because if they viewed it as a burgeoning racist violent movement targeting Jews then they would have to confront it and ask tough questions of why it is tolerated in a community . Expert J.J. McNab told the Associated Press that in fact this group takes pride in “ confronting Jewish people everywhere and explaining that they are evil. ” In American society there is generally only place for one kind of racism . There are far-right white supremacists and everyone else . This Manichean worldview of antisemitism and racism means we are only comfortable with one type of perpetrator . An angry white man . Those are the racists . Dylann Roof , the racist who murdered black people in a church in 2015 is the most normal kind of America racist . The El Paso shooter or the Tree of Life Synagogue attacker are also the kind of killers that fit into an easy narrative . But when the perpetrators stray from that we have a problem dealing with it . In New York City , according to a post by journalist Laura Adkins , data shows that of 69 anti-Jewish crimes in 2018 , forty of the perpetrators were labelled “ white ” and 25 were labelled “ black , ” the others were categorized as Hispanic or Asian.To keep the focus on the white supremacists , headlines need to explain to us that “ right wing terrorists ” have killed more than Jihadists , as Slate.com said earlier this year . Other types of terrorism are watered down a bit . During the Obama administration Islamist-inspired terror was even rebranded as “ violent extremism ” so as not to mention the religion of the perpetrators . For some reason even though Islamist terror is also a far-right ideology , it is portrayed as something else . For instance , when Jews were targeted at a kosher supermarket in France they were called “ random folk in a deli. ” They weren ’ t random , they were targeted , like the Jews in Jersey City , but they needed to be random or we ’ d have to ask about the antisemitism that permeates Islamist terror.In the wake of all the attacks in New York against Jews , culminating in the shooting attack at the kosher market , it became difficult to ignore the rising tide . But there is discomfort in looking at the depth of the perpetrators . The comfort society has with expecting perpetrators to be “ far-right ” and “ white ” even led Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib to blame “ white supremacy ” for the Jersey City attack . Her tweet was deleted . When it wasn ’ t white supremacy and there was no one to condemn , it didn ’ t fit the narrative and was less important.The suspects in Jersey City were called “ drifters , ” anything to make them seem unique , as if their views came from the moon . But the hatred of Jews and almost daily attacks in New York City and surrounding areas doesn ’ t come from thin air . It is motivated by a very clear ideology that has been appeased and tolerated in the name of tolerance of hatred . Almost every day in Brooklyn Jews are attacked . When this happened in the Pale of Settlement in the Russian Empire it was called a pogrom . If someone said that every day in Kiev Jews were being beaten and attacked on subways and in the streets , we would correctly identify it as a pogrom-like series of attacks . But not in New York.In one spate of November incidents a brick was thrown at a school for Jewish girls , three men were punched , and Jews had eggs thrown at them . Jews are also more likely to be victims of hate crimes in the area than any other group . Through September 1 there were 152 antisemitic hate crimes . It ’ s basically one a day and they are becoming more violent and now deadly.Hatred of Jews spans the white supremacist far right and the black supremacist far right and milieus in between . The difference is that society condemns and confronts comments by the white supremacists . Even with white supremacists , after the Poway and Pittsburgh attacks , we did not delve deeply into the wider community of hate online . “ We got our man , ” in finding the perpetrator , and that was enough . When dealing with the wider world of antisemitism in the US , that crosses racial lines , it is more difficult to confront . In the US , since it is difficult to accept that minorities might also be racist , the elephant in the room of black antisemitism is not mentioned . Too often , African American officials make openly antisemitic statements without fear of reaction . A school board member attacked “ brutes of the Jewish community ” after the Jersey City attack.In Washington DC an African American member of the city council claimed the Rothschilds control the weather . Instead of fully condemning him , he was invited to the Holocaust Museum and to experience Jewish holidays with the community . Why is the answer to antisemitism often the invitation to a nice embrace at a Jewish holiday ? Does the KKK get invited to a black church as a reward for their racism ? How about condemning first , apologies and introspection , and then a reward for reform would be an invitation . Unlike with white supremacy , other forms of antisemitism , such as black supremacist antisemitism , is seen as not the fault of the individual , but rather some ignorant ideas that a nice Passover dinner can correct . We need to do “ outreach , ” is the message.The attack on Jews as “ fake ” and “ white ” is rising . In November in London a black man took out a Bible and began harassing a Jewish Orthodox family until a Muslim woman intervened . The perpetrator was detained for a hate crime . In Miami a man also threatened Jews with a knife , calling them “ fake. ” In 2018 an Orthodox Jewish man was attacked in Crown Heights , called a “ fake Jew. ” This is inconvenient because it appears that there is a deep antisemitic milieu not dissimilar to the way white supremacist antisemitism spreads online and among communities , fueling hatred of Jews among other American minority groups , specifically some black Americans . This antisemitism has been around for decades , gaining strength in the 1990s as Jews began to be blamed for the slave trade.This trend in black antisemitism isn ’ t entirely unknown . It is discussed here and there , usually with excuses . For instance The Forward ran an article claiming that while “ White antisemites are motivated by a hatred of Jews and a desire for power , black anti-Semites are motivated by anger over gentrification , police brutality and slavery. ” The article claimed that Jews “ like all white people , part of the racist system that keeps black people under the foot of society. ” This is the way a Jewish newspaper explained hatred of Jews . It defined Jews as “ white ” and gave credence to the idea that antisemitism is motivated by “ police brutality and slavery. ” This is a window into a very real worldview that openly says Jews are behind police brutality and slavery and gentrification . In New York the police have stepped up their presence after attacks , but even that has been condemned as sending too many police to a neighborhood of “ people of color. ” Now Jews will be blamed for the police presence too instead of someone struggling against the violent antisemitism and inter-racial marches of solidarity against it.How did we get here ? The motivation behind the Jersey City attack is clear from social media posts one of the perpetrators made , according to a research by the ADL . This included claims that Jews are “ Khazars , ” and that “ Brooklyn is full of Nazis-Ashkenazis , ” and that the “ police are in their [ the Jews ] hand now. ” The worldview matches with the larger milieu in which Jews are portrayed as not merely “ white Jews ” but in fact as controlling the slave trade and police violence . In this new antisemitism Jews are reframed as both being “ fake , ” as in not really Jews from the Middle East , and also being “ white ” and running white supremacism . This replaces German Nazis with Jewish Nazis ; it replaces white supremacists with a hidden hand of Jews controlling both the American far-right and also the police . Instead of pushing back against this there are attempts to excuse it or just remain quiet about it and hope this antisemitism goes away.Despite the way this this antisemitism has combined traditional antisemitism with a twist , turning Jews into “ whites ” as opposed to hating them for being wandering Middle Easterners , there is very little recognition that it is dangerous . This is despite hundreds of violent attacks over the years , primarily targeting Orthodox Jews . Now , this has resulted in murder . But many voices want to downplay it and explain it away . For instance , The New Yorker asked whether an “ influx of Hasidic residents in the Greenville [ Jersey City ] neighborhood spur two assailants to embark on a shooting spree that left six people dead. ” Jews , simply for moving somewhere , may cause a shooting spree , in this explanation . Jews are the only US minority group who , when they move somewhere , are accused of being an “ influx. ” Others have argued that we can ’ t even label the recent attacks “ right wing ” or “ left wing ” because it ’ s totally different to “ white nationalists whose beliefs are based on antisemitism. ” A review of the discussion about the New York City attacks reveals an America that has trouble adjusting to and describing antisemitism when it comes from unexpected perpetrators . This is partly because the general view of racism in the US is that racism is not just about racism but about power . That is why in the US people look for racism in “ white privilege ” and the way racist views can be perpetuated even through code words and social settings and institutions . Confronted with the idea that minority groups are also racist , such as Hispanics using the n-word , there is a struggle to come to grips with how to define and confront . With the Jewish community there has been an agenda to argue over its relative “ whiteness ” and insofar as Jews are then removed from the intersectional agenda of minority groups fighting white privilege , Jews become either a separate category or part of the oppressive majority . This is odd but it is part of a wider agenda to assert that Zionism is racism and Jews are somehow linked to far-right groups through Israel and Israel is a modern apartheid colonialist structure . These ideas didn ’ t inform the Jersey City killings , but they are part of the milieu that informs those who might excuse the attacks.Another element at play is the fact people are being inured to antisemitism . There was so much violent antisemitism in 2019 that people are less shocked . Also , those most prone to be shocked , other members of the Jewish community , sometimes see haredi Jews through a vaguely discriminatory lens , which others them . There is little solidarity with Orthodox Jews as a minority group , whereas if they were another group , there would be a larger outpouring of sympathy.The result is a multi-layered cake of excuses and fear at confronting a wider range of perpetrators of antisemitism in New York . If violent antisemitism that sees Jews controlling the police and being responsible for slavery and white supremacy , is growing in the African American community in America then confronting it requires asking a minority community that is also a victim to be self-critical . In the US there tends to be pass for minority groups who are homophobic or racist . Society can only confront one kind of racism . This is largely because those driving the agenda of confronting racism either have blinders on regarding all forms of racism and antisemitism or are unaware of it because they don ’ t conduct surveys and polls regarding the prevalence of antisemitism in places like Brooklyn . When the perpetrators and victims do not fit a convenient model , it is easier to just excuse the attacks or see them as random . Unfortunately , in the US these attacks are not random , and there is rising violent antisemitism coming from a broad spectrum of communities , including white supremacists and from African Americans . Confronting it requires the same broad spectrum to step up the struggle .","The attack on a Rabbi in Monsey north of New York City on Saturday evening has left the Jewish community shaken. It follows at least eight other attacks in New York since the shooting attack on a kosher supermarket in early December. There have been near daily attacks in New York City this year, a kind of slow-moving pogrom against Jews, particularly targeting ultra-Orthodox Jews.The murder of three people at a kosher supermarket in Jersey City was mostly ignored in the United States. No rallies or marches against the antisemitism that led to it. No major political upheavals or even much recognition. The usual anger over gun violence after mass shootings was nowhere to be found. The victims and the perpetrators are inconvenient. America as a whole can’t mourn Orthodox Jews and it can’t confront perpetrators when the perpetrators come from a minority community. This is inconvenient antisemitism and it is a kind of antisemitism privilege. Despite widespread anti-racism programs in the US, there are still those in America for whom being antisemitic is a birthright and not something to be ashamed of. The number of people raised with violent antisemitic beliefs is growing.The Jersey City murders are the culmination of years of incitement against Jews. But the perpetrators in that case were themselves minorities from the African American community. The perpetrators have been identified as coming from an extremist religious group called Black Hebrew Israelites, making them a minority of a minority. The perpetrators are seen as a “militant” fringe within that minority.The authorities are now looking at the case as domestic terrorism fueled by antisemitism. However major media have endeavored to dismiss the murders as unimportant and unique. The New York Times described the Black Hebrew Israelites as being “known for their inflammatory sidewalk ministers who employ provocation as a form of gospel.” It’s a bit more than that. In fact, the group and the milieu around it tend to view religion through a racial lens, such that Jews are described as “white” and “fake” and the “real Jews” are portrayed as black, along with all the prophets and religious figures. The ADL pointed out that this group views itself as the real “chosen people” and that it sees people of color as the real descendants of the 12 tribes. The group was in the media earlier in the year in Washington DC when they shouted insults at Catholic high school students.Mainstream society wants to view this as “provocation,” because if they viewed it as a burgeoning racist violent movement targeting Jews then they would have to confront it and ask tough questions of why it is tolerated in a community. Expert J.J. McNab told the Associated Press that in fact this group takes pride in “confronting Jewish people everywhere and explaining that they are evil.”In American society there is generally only place for one kind of racism. There are far-right white supremacists and everyone else. This Manichean worldview of antisemitism and racism means we are only comfortable with one type of perpetrator. An angry white man. Those are the racists. Dylann Roof, the racist who murdered black people in a church in 2015 is the most normal kind of America racist. The El Paso shooter or the Tree of Life Synagogue attacker are also the kind of killers that fit into an easy narrative. But when the perpetrators stray from that we have a problem dealing with it. In New York City , according to a post by journalist Laura Adkins, data shows that of 69 anti-Jewish crimes in 2018, forty of the perpetrators were labelled “white” and 25 were labelled “black,” the others were categorized as Hispanic or Asian.To keep the focus on the white supremacists, headlines need to explain to us that “right wing terrorists” have killed more than Jihadists, as Slate.com said earlier this year. Other types of terrorism are watered down a bit. During the Obama administration Islamist-inspired terror was even rebranded as “violent extremism” so as not to mention the religion of the perpetrators. For some reason even though Islamist terror is also a far-right ideology, it is portrayed as something else. For instance, when Jews were targeted at a kosher supermarket in France they were called “random folk in a deli.” They weren’t random, they were targeted, like the Jews in Jersey City, but they needed to be random or we’d have to ask about the antisemitism that permeates Islamist terror.In the wake of all the attacks in New York against Jews, culminating in the shooting attack at the kosher market, it became difficult to ignore the rising tide. But there is discomfort in looking at the depth of the perpetrators. The comfort society has with expecting perpetrators to be “far-right” and “white” even led Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib to blame “white supremacy” for the Jersey City attack. Her tweet was deleted. When it wasn’t white supremacy and there was no one to condemn, it didn’t fit the narrative and was less important.The suspects in Jersey City were called “drifters,” anything to make them seem unique, as if their views came from the moon. But the hatred of Jews and almost daily attacks in New York City and surrounding areas doesn’t come from thin air. It is motivated by a very clear ideology that has been appeased and tolerated in the name of tolerance of hatred. Almost every day in Brooklyn Jews are attacked. When this happened in the Pale of Settlement in the Russian Empire it was called a pogrom. If someone said that every day in Kiev Jews were being beaten and attacked on subways and in the streets, we would correctly identify it as a pogrom-like series of attacks. But not in New York.In one spate of November incidents a brick was thrown at a school for Jewish girls, three men were punched, and Jews had eggs thrown at them. Jews are also more likely to be victims of hate crimes in the area than any other group. Through September 1 there were 152 antisemitic hate crimes. It’s basically one a day and they are becoming more violent and now deadly.Hatred of Jews spans the white supremacist far right and the black supremacist far right and milieus in between. The difference is that society condemns and confronts comments by the white supremacists. Even with white supremacists, after the Poway and Pittsburgh attacks, we did not delve deeply into the wider community of hate online. “We got our man,” in finding the perpetrator, and that was enough. When dealing with the wider world of antisemitism in the US, that crosses racial lines, it is more difficult to confront. In the US, since it is difficult to accept that minorities might also be racist, the elephant in the room of black antisemitism is not mentioned. Too often, African American officials make openly antisemitic statements without fear of reaction. A school board member attacked “brutes of the Jewish community” after the Jersey City attack.In Washington DC an African American member of the city council claimed the Rothschilds control the weather. Instead of fully condemning him, he was invited to the Holocaust Museum and to experience Jewish holidays with the community. Why is the answer to antisemitism often the invitation to a nice embrace at a Jewish holiday? Does the KKK get invited to a black church as a reward for their racism? How about condemning first, apologies and introspection, and then a reward for reform would be an invitation. Unlike with white supremacy, other forms of antisemitism, such as black supremacist antisemitism, is seen as not the fault of the individual, but rather some ignorant ideas that a nice Passover dinner can correct. We need to do “outreach,” is the message.The attack on Jews as “fake” and “white” is rising. In November in London a black man took out a Bible and began harassing a Jewish Orthodox family until a Muslim woman intervened. The perpetrator was detained for a hate crime. In Miami a man also threatened Jews with a knife, calling them “fake.” In 2018 an Orthodox Jewish man was attacked in Crown Heights, called a “fake Jew.”This is inconvenient because it appears that there is a deep antisemitic milieu not dissimilar to the way white supremacist antisemitism spreads online and among communities, fueling hatred of Jews among other American minority groups, specifically some black Americans.

Missouri Highway Patrol Capt . Ron Johnson told reporters in Ferguson early Tuesday that 31 people had been arrested during a night of unrest that followed a day of largely peaceful protest . As Johnson spoke , two handguns and a Molotov cocktail that he said had been confiscated during the night by authorities lay on a table in front of him .
The majority-black town of approximately 21,000 has been roiled by unrest since the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown , who was fatally shot by a white police officer following a confrontation of some kind on the afternoon of August 9 .

A visibly angry Johnson said that officers had come under heavy gunfire from protesters and at least two people had been shot . Johnson said he did not know the condition of the shooting victims . Four officers had been injured when they were struck by rocks or bottles , though Johnson claimed that police had not fired a single shot .
Citing what he called a `` dangerous dynamic in the night , '' Johnson requested that protests take place during the daylight hours , so that officers could effectively isolate any troublemakers . However , Johnson said that his forces could not make protesters leave the streets after sunset if they did not want to .
`` This nation is watching each and every one of us , '' said Johnson . `` I am not going to let the criminals that have come here from across this country , or live in this neighborhood , define this community .

`` We do not want to lose another life in this community , '' Johnson added .
Shortly before midnight local time , the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that police fired tear gas at a group of protesters who had reportedly defied orders to leave the parking lot of a burned-out QuikTrip convenience store that has been near the center of demonstrations over the past eight day . St. Louis County Police Chief Sam Dotson told reporters that shots had been fired in the area and media members were told to go to a designated area about a quarter of a mile away .

At his news conference , Johnson said in some cases it was not immediately clear who was a reporter but that once it was established , police acted properly .
As darkness fell , National Guard units with armored vehicles were waiting at a staging area about a half-mile from the portion of West Florissant Avenue that has been the scene of the largest protests . Closer to the protest site , a crowd of demonstrators was marching and growing in size . Sheriff 's deputies in body armor and state troopers carrying wooden bats and gas masks stood watch over the group .
The Post-Dispatch reported that some protesters began throwing bottles at police shortly after 10 p.m. local time . Authorities responded by ordering protesters to clear the streets and firing high-pitched sound cannons .
Another group of protesters marched toward the police lines and stopped , defying orders that demonstrators could not assemble in a single spot , but had to keep moving instead . The Post-Dispatch reported that an armored vehicle moved down the street trying to clear the crowd and a group of pastors locked arms and helped to move protesters away from the police line .

violence_in_america,CNN (Web News),0,http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/05/opinions/reyes-shooter-doesnt-represent-immigrants/index.html,OPINION: Don't blame all immigrants for San Francisco shooting,2015-07-05,Raul A. Reyes,"Raul A. Reyes is an attorney and member of the USA Today board of contributors . Follow him on Twitter @ RaulAReyes . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author .
( CNN ) As the nation was preparing for the July Fourth weekend , there was grim news from San Francisco . On Wednesday night , Kate Steinle , 31 , was fatally shot , apparently randomly , while walking with her father on a busy pier . A Mexican immigrant , who CNN reported was in the country without documentation , was arrested in her death .
Illegally re-entering the country after being deported , as Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez is said to have done , is a federal felony . He has also been accused of a horrific , violent crime . And according to immigration authorities , he has seven other felony convictions , including four for drug offenses .
But that does n't make him a symbol of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States . Nor is he the poster boy for out-of-control illegal immigration across our southern border ( illegal immigration from Mexico is at a 40-year low ) . He does not represent the overwhelming majority of immigrants in this country -- legal or otherwise -- who are productive members of society .
Lopez-Sanchez is simply a dangerous individual who should not have been free and among us .
It is a myth that increased illegal immigration leads to more crime . Research from the Immigration Policy Center shows that crime rates fell in the United States as the size of our immigrant population , including undocumented immigrants , grew from 1990 to 2010 .
JUST WATCHED Undocumented immigrants want to enlist Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Undocumented immigrants want to enlist 02:30
The Washington Post just analyzed Donald Trump 's recent comments about Mexican immigrants being drug dealers and `` rapists '' and found that he was wrong about immigrants and crime . Remember , being in the country without authorization is not a crime -- it is a civil infraction .
Most undocumented immigrants come to the United States to work and provide a better life for themselves and their families .
Consider that several mass shootings , from Aurora to Newtown to Charleston , were committed by young white men . Does that mean that all young white men are potential mass murderers ? Of course not .
The same news outlets that are now trumpeting Wednesday 's murder as proof that undocumented immigrants are criminals often overlook or ignore other stories of undocumented immigrants who are genuine heroes . In 2013 , an undocumented immigrant rescued a mother and her child on Staten Island , New York , amidst the storm surge of Superstorm Sandy .
JUST WATCHED DREAMer fights her family 's deportation Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH DREAMer fights her family 's deportation 02:50
One takeaway from this episode is that deporting as many undocumented immigrants as possible is not the answer to our immigration problems . Lopez-Sanchez had been deported five times , and yet he was still here in the country without authorization .
Back in 2011 , the deputy director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement told an immigration subcommittee of Congress that it costs $ 12,500 to deport a person . Multiply this by five and that is how much taxpayer money was wasted on a criminal who remained at large to randomly take the life of an innocent young woman .
Another lesson here is our country does not need more immigration enforcement ; our country needs smarter and better immigration enforcement . Up to now , immigration authorities have wasted time , manpower and money chasing after people working productively in their communities as , say , gardeners and maids , while felons like Lopez-Sanchez slipped through the cracks .

Reyes is an attorney and member of the USA Today board of contributors. Follow him on Twitter @RaulAReyes . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.

(CNN) As the nation was preparing for the July Fourth weekend, there was grim news from San Francisco. On Wednesday night, Kate Steinle , 31, was fatally shot, apparently randomly, while walking with her father on a busy pier. A Mexican immigrant, who CNN reported was in the country without documentation, was arrested in her death.

Illegally re-entering the country after being deported, as Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez is said to have done, is a federal felony . He has also been accused of a horrific, violent crime. And according to immigration authorities, he has seven other felony convictions, including four for drug offenses.

But that doesn't make him a symbol of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. Nor is he the poster boy for out-of-control illegal immigration across our southern border (illegal immigration from Mexico is at a 40-year low). He does not represent the overwhelming majority of immigrants in this country -- legal or otherwise -- who are productive members of society.

Lopez-Sanchez is simply a dangerous individual who should not have been free and among us.

It is a myth that increased illegal immigration leads to more crime. Research from the Immigration Policy Center shows that crime rates fell in the United States as the size of our immigrant population, including undocumented immigrants, grew from 1990 to 2010.

The Washington Post just analyzed Donald Trump's recent comments about Mexican immigrants being drug dealers and ""rapists"" and found that he was wrong about immigrants and crime. Remember, being in the country without authorization is not a crime -- it is a civil infraction.

Most undocumented immigrants come to the United States to work and provide a better life for themselves and their families.

Consider that several mass shootings, from Aurora to Newtown to Charleston, were committed by young white men. Does that mean that all young white men are potential mass murderers? Of course not.

The same news outlets that are now trumpeting Wednesday's murder as proof that undocumented immigrants are criminals often overlook or ignore other stories of undocumented immigrants who are genuine heroes. In 2013, an undocumented immigrant rescued a mother and her child on Staten Island, New York, amidst the storm surge of Superstorm Sandy.

One takeaway from this episode is that deporting as many undocumented immigrants as possible is not the answer to our immigration problems. Lopez-Sanchez had been deported five times, and yet he was still here in the country without authorization.

Back in 2011, the deputy director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement told an immigration subcommittee of Congress that it costs $12,500 to deport a person. Multiply this by five and that is how much taxpayer money was wasted on a criminal who remained at large to randomly take the life of an innocent young woman.

Another lesson here is our country does not need more immigration enforcement; our country needs smarter and better immigration enforcement. Up to now, immigration authorities have wasted time, manpower and money chasing after people working productively in their communities as, say, gardeners and maids, while felons like Lopez-Sanchez slipped through the cracks.

That's why it was good news last week that the Department of Homeland Security announced it is rethinking its deportation priorities to focus on recent arrivals and serious criminals.

This move is a step in the right direction, because it is time to start seriously targeting those immigrants who are a real threat to public safety. The government will be focusing its enforcement efforts on three categories of people: convicted criminals, recent border crossers and terrorism threats.

True, Lopez-Sanchez should not have been in the country, or he should have at least been behind bars. But Immigration and Customs Enforcement erred in not seeking a warrant or court order for his arrest and he was released in accordance with city law in March.

What's more, President Barack Obama's proposed executive action on immigration, currently tied up in a legal battle, might also have made a difference because it would have freed up resources to go after people like Lopez-Sanchez.

The executive action would have given deportation relief to parents of DREAMers, while allowing DHS to zero in on criminals. Instead, despite the fact that our country spends more on immigration enforcement than all other law enforcement agencies combined, our system failed Kate Steinle.

Security check

Alexis was one of about 4.8 million government and contractor employees who hold some type of security clearance. The main designations are confidential, secret, top secret, and top secret, special compartmented information.

Alexis‘ secret clearance is more restrictive than a top-secret designation, which allows the holder wider access into the nation’s classified world.

A secret clearance can be issued within a week or a few months.

In conducting a security clearance background check, the government requires an applicant’s Social Security number and address, and examines the person’s credit history and work experience going back 10 years. It also requires at least three character references and three work references from a manager and co-workers.

Investigators would have been required to check Alexis‘ military and criminal records, but his honorable discharge would have weighed heavily in his favor in obtaining a clearance. A less-than-honorable discharge, which the Navy initially sought, would have triggered a more thorough review of his personnel file.

In addition, although Alexis was arrested on a gun-related charge in Seattle in 2004, he was not convicted of a crime. He enlisted in the Navy Reserve in 2007.

The Pentagon relied on his secret clearance when he left the Navy in 2011 and began working as a contractor in the defense industry, a defense official said late Tuesday.

“The ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing of national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security is based on an overall common-sense judgment taking into account behaviors associated with the adjudicative guidelines and evaluated in the context of the whole person,” the official said.

His clearance was issued by the Pentagon’s Defense Security Service. A spokeswoman for the agency declined to comment Tuesday.

Alexis worked as a computer technician for the firm The Experts, on a subcontract from Hewlett-Packard.

FBI Assistant Director Valerie Parlave said Tuesday that Alexis gained access to the Navy Yard with a “valid pass.”

Flawed system

In a report Tuesday, the Pentagon’s acting inspector general said the security system for screening Navy contractors had issued credentials to 52 felons, placing “military personnel, dependents, civilians and installations at an increased security risk.”

The Navy Commercial Access Control System (NCACS) allowed numerous contractors to access bases “without having their identities vetted through mandatory authoritative databases, such as the National Crime Information Center database and the Terrorist Screening Database,” the report said.

Instead, contractors were vetted using only publicly available information and databases, investigators found.

However, a Navy official said on background that any flaws in the commercial access control system were unrelated to Alexis‘ ability to access the Navy Yard. Alexis had been issued with a common access card, which allows holders access to military facilities regardless of branch of service.

“The report looks at NCACS. This guy didn’t have an NCACS card,” the Navy official said.

The inspector general’s report blames system’s flaws on the Navy’s desire to save money, saying it “minimized costs to perform contractor credentialing and vetting.”

NCACS is a servicewide system designed to issue and check credentials for contractors and others who need regular access to naval facilities but who are not entitled to a common access card.

A spokesman for Mr. Turner of the House Committee on Armed Services said the congressman met with officials from the inspector general’s office to discuss the report’s findings, and is writing a letter to Navy Secretary Ray Mabus encouraging the service to implement all the report’s suggestions.

According to a new report published Monday , the company filed the complaints against the more than 1,000 shooting victims in federal courts in both Nevada and California , arguing that pending lawsuits against MGM should `` be dismissed . ''
`` Plaintiffs have no liability of any kind to defendants , '' the complaints argue , per the Las Vegas Review-Journal .
One Las Vegas attorney representing victims slammed the resort owner 's filings as a `` blatant display of judge shopping '' that `` quite frankly verges on unethical . ''
`` I 've never seen a more outrageous thing , where they sue the victims in an effort to find a judge they like , '' Robert Eglet told the Review-Journal . `` It 's just really sad that they would stoop to this level . ''
On Monday , a spokeswoman released a statement that framed MGM Resort International 's move as a win for the community at large .
`` The Federal Court is an appropriate venue for these cases and provides those affected with the opportunity for a timely resolution , '' Debra DeShong said . `` Years of drawn out litigation and hearings are not in the best interest of victims , the community and those still healing . ''
In early October of last year , Mandalay Bay guest Stephen Paddock shot out the windows of his 32nd-floor room and opened fire on concertgoers attending the Route 91 Harvest music festival .
In what is now considered to be the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history , Paddock killed 59 people and injured more than 800 .
By the time police reached him , Paddock had already killed himself . His motive remains unclear .
Lawsuits alleging that the festival did not have adequate exits and security or properly-trained staff have been filed against both MGM and concert promoter Live Nation , which some victims claim resulted in additional injuries and exposure to the gunman 's fire .
The legal argument behind MGM 's lawsuits relies on an interpretation of a federal law passed in the wake of 9/11 , according to USA Today :
MGM claims the case must be dealt with in federal court under terms of the post-9/11 Safety Act , which provides incentives for development and deployment of anti-terrorism technologies . The company says the security firm it contracted for the concert , CSC , was approved by the Department of Homeland Security and thus released from liability under the act . That release extends to the Mandalay Bay hotel , MGM says .
It is unclear , however , if MGM 's rationale would pass muster in court . As the Review-Journal points out , the Federal Bureau of Investigation never labeled Paddock 's crime as `` an act of terrorism '' :
The act cited in the new lawsuits was passed just more than a year after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks and intentionally included broad protections . For instance , the act defines terrorism as any unlawful act inside the United States that causes “ mass destruction , injury or other loss. ” The FBI has not called the Las Vegas mass shooting an act of terrorism because the gunman had no clear motive , and the FBI defines terrorism as an act of terror associated with extremist ideologies of a political , religious , social , racial or environmental nature .
`` Even if MGM is successful , that may not outweigh the adverse publicity for the company that the suit generates , '' Carl Tobias , a professor at the University of Richmond 's law school , told the outlet .","The corporate owners of Mandalay Bay and the Route 91 Harvest festival venue have filed federal lawsuits against the victims of last year's mass shooting at a country music concert in Las Vegas, claiming that MGM Resorts International has zero liability in the deadly Oct. 1 incident.

violence_in_america,BBC News,1,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48085514,San Diego synagogue shooting: Rabbi describes seeing attacker,,,"A rabbi who was injured in the deadly shooting at a synagogue near San Diego on Saturday has described the moment he faced the gunman .
Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein says he lifted his hands when he saw the `` murder terrorist '' . The man shot and the rabbi lost his right index finger .
One woman died and two other people were injured in the attack .
A 19-year-old man named as John Earnest was arrested shortly afterwards in Poway , north of the Californian city .
The attack comes exactly six months after a shooting in Pittsburgh in which 11 people were killed , thought to be the worst anti-Semitic attack in recent US history .
Rabbi Goldstein was walking into the banquet hall at the synagogue when he heard a noise - what he thought initially was a table falling over or a congregation member collapsing .
`` As soon as he saw me , he started to shoot toward me and that is when I put my hands up , '' Rabbi Goldstein said on NBC 's Sunday Today programme . `` I can not erase that face from my mind . ''
He held up his hands to shield himself but his fingers `` got blown away '' .
Rabbi Goldstein hurried through to the banquet hall where a number of children - including his granddaughter - were gathered .
`` I just ran , not even knowing that my fingers were blown off and curled all the kids together and got them outside , '' he said .
Lori Kaye , who helped found the synagogue with Rabbi Goldstein , was shot dead in the attack .
`` Everyone in the community knew her , '' he said . `` I 'm just so heartbroken and saddened by the senseless killing . ''
A 34-year-old man and a young girl suffered shrapnel wounds in the attack .
The routine is all too familiar . Another murderous attack on a place of worship , this time in San Diego , followed by the obligatory offer of prayers . `` Thoughts and prayers to all those affected '' , tweeted President Donald Trump .
Then , during a brief on-camera statement , Mr Trump said it looked like a hate-crime . `` Hard to believe , '' he added . Sadly , it is not hard to believe at all .
Anti-Semitic incidents in the US surged 57 % in 2017 - the most recent data available - the largest year-on-year increase since the century-old Jewish advocacy group began collecting data in 1979 , says the Anti-Defamation League ( ADL ) , which monitors extremism in the US .
The horrendous attack in San Diego follows the deadliest attack on Jews in US history at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh last October . It will now be added to the ADL figures . And the numbers , to tragic results , continue to rise .
Sheriff Gore said officers were called to the Chabad synagogue just before 11:30 ( 18:30 GMT ) after the man opened fire with an `` AR-15 type '' assault rifle .
He said an off-duty border patrol officer had fired at the suspect as he fled the scene in a vehicle , but had not not hit him .
The suspect was later arrested by another officer , said San Diego chief of police David Nisleit .
`` He clearly saw the suspect 's vehicle , the suspect jumped out with his hands up and was immediately taken into custody , '' Mr Nisleit said .
`` As the officer was placing this 19-year-old male into custody , he clearly saw a rifle on the front passenger seat of the suspect vehicle . ''
San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore told reporters that investigators were reviewing the suspect 's social media activity and examining a virulently anti-Semitic `` open letter '' published online .
In the letter , which appeared on the online forum 8chan hours before the attack , the author - who identified himself as John Earnest - said he had been inspired by the attack on two Christchurch mosques last month , as well as the Pittsburgh shooting last October .
The racist , anti-Semitic document that police are investigating in relation to the shooting makes 10 references to Robert Bowers - charged with killing 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh - whom the author John Earnest calls an `` inspiration '' .
Authorities later said Mr Earnest was under investigation in connection with a fire at a mosque last month .
`` All of the Jewish community across the country is concerned , '' Joel Rubin , a Democratic Strategist and member of the Tree of Life synagogue , told Fox News on Saturday . `` My daughters go to Hebrew school and we see police cars often in front of the school , guarding it . That 's not the situation in America we want to be living in . ''
Meanwhile , the Times of Israel published a blog post headlined , `` Synagogue shootings - now a thing '' .
In the aftermath of the Pittsburgh attack , members of the US Jewish community began openly questioning whether the era of seeing the US as a safe haven was over .
`` I had been dreading and expecting this day , and more like it , for two years , '' wrote the Washington Post columnist Dana Millbank , in a column titled `` Trump 's America is not a safe place for Jews '' .
Mr Trump has publicly condemned anti-Semitism , and White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said it was `` outrageous '' to suggest he bore any responsibility for it , but many have accused him of using coded anti-Semitic language .

Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein says he lifted his hands when he saw the ""murder terrorist"". The man shot and the rabbi lost his right index finger.

One woman died and two other people were injured in the attack.

A 19-year-old man named as John Earnest was arrested shortly afterwards in Poway, north of the Californian city.

The attack comes exactly six months after a shooting in Pittsburgh in which 11 people were killed, thought to be the worst anti-Semitic attack in recent US history.

What did the rabbi say?

Rabbi Goldstein was walking into the banquet hall at the synagogue when he heard a noise - what he thought initially was a table falling over or a congregation member collapsing.

""As soon as he saw me, he started to shoot toward me and that is when I put my hands up,"" Rabbi Goldstein said on NBC's Sunday Today programme. ""I cannot erase that face from my mind.""

He held up his hands to shield himself but his fingers ""got blown away"".

Rabbi Goldstein hurried through to the banquet hall where a number of children - including his granddaughter - were gathered.

""I just ran, not even knowing that my fingers were blown off and curled all the kids together and got them outside,"" he said.

Lori Kaye, who helped found the synagogue with Rabbi Goldstein, was shot dead in the attack.

""Everyone in the community knew her,"" he said. ""I'm just so heartbroken and saddened by the senseless killing.""

A 34-year-old man and a young girl suffered shrapnel wounds in the attack.

Worshippers attacked, again

By Martin Bashir, BBC religion editor

The routine is all too familiar. Another murderous attack on a place of worship, this time in San Diego, followed by the obligatory offer of prayers. ""Thoughts and prayers to all those affected"", tweeted President Donald Trump.

Then, during a brief on-camera statement, Mr Trump said it looked like a hate-crime. ""Hard to believe,"" he added. Sadly, it is not hard to believe at all.

Anti-Semitic incidents in the US surged 57% in 2017 - the most recent data available - the largest year-on-year increase since the century-old Jewish advocacy group began collecting data in 1979, says the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which monitors extremism in the US.

The horrendous attack in San Diego follows the deadliest attack on Jews in US history at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh last October. It will now be added to the ADL figures. And the numbers, to tragic results, continue to rise.

How did the attack unfold?

Sheriff Gore said officers were called to the Chabad synagogue just before 11:30 (18:30 GMT) after the man opened fire with an ""AR-15 type"" assault rifle.

He said an off-duty border patrol officer had fired at the suspect as he fled the scene in a vehicle, but had not not hit him.

The suspect was later arrested by another officer, said San Diego chief of police David Nisleit.

""He clearly saw the suspect's vehicle, the suspect jumped out with his hands up and was immediately taken into custody,"" Mr Nisleit said.

""As the officer was placing this 19-year-old male into custody, he clearly saw a rifle on the front passenger seat of the suspect vehicle.""

San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore told reporters that investigators were reviewing the suspect's social media activity and examining a virulently anti-Semitic ""open letter"" published online.

In the letter, which appeared on the online forum 8chan hours before the attack, the author - who identified himself as John Earnest - said he had been inspired by the attack on two Christchurch mosques last month, as well as the Pittsburgh shooting last October.

The racist, anti-Semitic document that police are investigating in relation to the shooting makes 10 references to Robert Bowers - charged with killing 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh - whom the author John Earnest calls an ""inspiration"".

Authorities later said Mr Earnest was under investigation in connection with a fire at a mosque last month.

How has the Jewish community reacted?

""All of the Jewish community across the country is concerned,"" Joel Rubin, a Democratic Strategist and member of the Tree of Life synagogue, told Fox News on Saturday. ""My daughters go to Hebrew school and we see police cars often in front of the school, guarding it. That's not the situation in America we want to be living in.""

Meanwhile, the Times of Israel published a blog post headlined, ""Synagogue shootings - now a thing"".

In the aftermath of the Pittsburgh attack, members of the US Jewish community began openly questioning whether the era of seeing the US as a safe haven was over.

""I had been dreading and expecting this day, and more like it, for two years,"" wrote the Washington Post columnist Dana Millbank, in a column titled ""Trump's America is not a safe place for Jews"".

Mr Trump has publicly condemned anti-Semitism, and White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said it was ""outrageous"" to suggest he bore any responsibility for it, but many have accused him of using coded anti-Semitic language.

The ADL publicly called on him to stop using tropes such as ""global special interests"" and ""those who control the levers of power"" - both of which he ran in an ad alongside pictures of prominent Jews - as well as his claim that there were ""very fine people on both sides"" in Charlottesville, after white nationalists chanted ""Jews will not replace us"".",www.bbc.com,center,lQyXX410ilTXbKVA

All 29 people injured in the explosion , which happened on West 23rd Street in New York City 's Chelsea neighborhood , had been released from area hospitals by Sunday morning , Gov . Andrew Cuomo said during a news conference . Authorities were now squarely focusing on who placed the explosive device on West 23rd Street , and a second , unexploded device four blocks away .
`` Whoever placed these bombs we will find , and they will be brought to justice . Period , '' Cuomo said . `` We will not allow these types of people and these types of threats to disrupt our life in New York . ''
Officials did not believe the New York blast had any connection to several pipe bombs found earlier Saturday along the route of a charity run in New Jersey , Cuomo said . He added there was no link to an explosive device found in July in Central Park .
`` Louder than any thunder I 've ever heard in my life . Like the sky exploded . Shook the building '' NYC explosion pic.twitter.com/WsY3Ax7PS7 — Liz Mandel ( @ elisabetherapy ) September 18 , 2016
`` No evidence of an international terrorism connection with this incident , but it is very , very early in the investigation , and it 's just starting , '' Cuomo said .
The blast appeared to originate from a construction toolbox in front of a building at around 8:30 p.m. , a law enforcement official told The Associated Press . A garbage can was found mangled nearby .
Less than three hours after the explosion , investigators located a pressure cooker inside a plastic bag at West 27th Street that was attached to wiring and a cellphone , a law enforcement source told Fox News . It was not clear what was inside the device . Police advised residents of the block where the pressure cooker was found to stay away from windows facing 27th Street .
Cuomo said the device on 23rd street and the device on 27th street were `` both similar in design . ''
Early Sunday , police said the pressure cooker had been removed from the area and would be taken to the department 's firing range in the Bronx for further analysis . Pressure cooker bombs placed inside garbage cans were used by the terrorists who bombed the Boston Marathon in 2013 .
`` At this point , no individual or group has called to claim responsibility , '' Police Commissioner James P. O'Neill said on Sunday .

All 29 people injured in the explosion, which happened on West 23rd Street in New York City's Chelsea neighborhood, had been released from area hospitals by Sunday morning, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said during a news conference. Authorities were now squarely focusing on who placed the explosive device on West 23rd Street, and a second, unexploded device four blocks away.

""Whoever placed these bombs we will find, and they will be brought to justice. Period,"" Cuomo said. ""We will not allow these types of people and these types of threats to disrupt our life in New York.""

Officials did not believe the New York blast had any connection to several pipe bombs found earlier Saturday along the route of a charity run in New Jersey, Cuomo said. He added there was no link to an explosive device found in July in Central Park.

""No evidence of an international terrorism connection with this incident, but it is very, very early in the investigation, and it's just starting,"" Cuomo said.

The blast appeared to originate from a construction toolbox in front of a building at around 8:30 p.m., a law enforcement official told The Associated Press. A garbage can was found mangled nearby.

Less than three hours after the explosion, investigators located a pressure cooker inside a plastic bag at West 27th Street that was attached to wiring and a cellphone, a law enforcement source told Fox News. It was not clear what was inside the device. Police advised residents of the block where the pressure cooker was found to stay away from windows facing 27th Street.

Cuomo said the device on 23rd street and the device on 27th street were ""both similar in design.""

Early Sunday, police said the pressure cooker had been removed from the area and would be taken to the department's firing range in the Bronx for further analysis. Pressure cooker bombs placed inside garbage cans were used by the terrorists who bombed the Boston Marathon in 2013.

""At this point, no individual or group has called to claim responsibility,"" Police Commissioner James P. O'Neill said on Sunday.

Fox News was told there had been no prior intelligence suggesting Saturday's events may have been imminent.

Witnesses said the explosion blew out the windows of businesses and scattered debris in the area. One witness told Fox News the explosion sent a ""big cloud of black smoke"" into the air as people ran from the scene. Another said a fireball shot into the air as a nearby building shook.

Jon Avidor, who lives near the blast site, said mirrors fell off his walls when the explosion occurred.

""I thought it might be a bomb just because it felt like one,"" Avidor told ""Fox & Friends.""

The blast happened in front of a residence for the blind, near a major thoroughfare with many restaurants and a Trader Joe's supermarket.

violence_in_america,CNBC,1,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/17/senate-republicans-reveal-police-reform-bill-that-breaks-with-democrats-on-key-issues.html,Senate Republicans reveal police reform bill that breaks with Democrats on key issues,2020-06-17,Kevin Breuninger,"Sen. Tim Scott ( R-SC ) is joined by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R-KY ) ( L ) and fellow Republican lawmakers for a news conference to unveil the GOP 's legislation to address racial disparities in law enforcement at the U.S. Capitol June 17 , 2020 in Washington , DC .
Senate Republicans on Wednesday unveiled their bill to reform the police , the latest effort by lawmakers to overhaul U.S. law enforcement in the face of unrelenting pressure from activists in the wake of George Floyd 's death .
Incentivize law enforcement agencies to ban the use of chokeholds by tying funding to whether departments have prohibited the practice `` except when deadly force is authorized '' ;
Ramp up data collection efforts to track when an officer 's use of force results in death or serious harm ;
Provide federal money for additional training on alternatives to the use of force ;
Include language recognizing the history of lynching in the United States ;
Require law enforcement agencies to send the attorney general reports on no-knock warrants ;
Create a commission to study issues that affect Black men and boys
The bill comes a day after President Donald Trump signed an executive order that would incentivize police departments to update their standards and practices and strengthen efforts to track officer misconduct . The Senate Republicans ' offering in some ways hews closer to the president 's action than the sweeping legislative proposal put forward last week by congressional Democrats .

Tim Scott (R-SC) is joined by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) (L) and fellow Republican lawmakers for a news conference to unveil the GOP's legislation to address racial disparities in law enforcement at the U.S. Capitol June 17, 2020 in Washington, DC.

Senate Republicans on Wednesday unveiled their bill to reform the police, the latest effort by lawmakers to overhaul U.S. law enforcement in the face of unrelenting pressure from activists in the wake of George Floyd's death.

Here's some of what the Republicans' bill would do:

Incentivize law enforcement agencies to ban the use of chokeholds by tying funding to whether departments have prohibited the practice ""except when deadly force is authorized"";

Ramp up data collection efforts to track when an officer's use of force results in death or serious harm;

Provide federal money for additional training on alternatives to the use of force;

Include language recognizing the history of lynching in the United States;

Strengthen penalties for falsifying police reports;

Require law enforcement agencies to send the attorney general reports on no-knock warrants;

Create a commission to study issues that affect Black men and boys

The bill comes a day after President Donald Trump signed an executive order that would incentivize police departments to update their standards and practices and strengthen efforts to track officer misconduct. The Senate Republicans' offering in some ways hews closer to the president's action than the sweeping legislative proposal put forward last week by congressional Democrats.

The Senate Republicans' bill has Trump's total support, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters later Wednesday. ""It's a great bill, it's more great action from Republicans, and we hope we can have bipartisan support on that,"" she said.

violence_in_america,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/identities/2020/6/4/21276674/protests-george-floyd-arbery-nationwide-trump,Why these protests are different,2020-06-04,Sean Collins,"Americans have come out nightly in nearly every US city to demonstrate for the past week . They ’ ve been attacked by police , tear-gassed , and arrested , and have marched shoulder to shoulder amid a deadly pandemic . Their demand : an end to racism , police brutality , and the attitudes and policies that allow both to exist .
We have seen uprisings over racism and police brutality before , the most famous being the civil rights movement of the 1960s . There was sometimes a sense that those uprisings had brought on a great deal of progress in a short period and that the eradication of systemic racism would be a long-term project from then on out , with incremental changes ensuring the arc of the moral universe bent toward justice . The recent protest movement — though nascent — seems to reject that idea . The protesters want change now .
And it is easy to see why : Systemic racism takes a physical , existential toll on communities of color .
There is the police violence itself — most recently , against George Floyd , an unarmed black man who died after a white police officer pinned him down by the neck with his knee for nearly nine minutes . Among Floyd ’ s final words were “ I can ’ t breathe , ” mirroring the last moments of Eric Garner , another unarmed black man who died after a white police officer squeezed his neck for 15 seconds in 2014 .
Floyd ’ s killing followed the killing of Breonna Taylor by police in her own home , the shooting of Sean Reed in Indiana , the shooting of Tony McDade in Florida , and the extrajudicial killing of Ahmaud Arbery by a white father and son , the former a retired police detective , now charged with murder and aggravated assault .
Beyond the recent spate of police killings , there is , of course , Covid-19 , a disease that has disproportionately taken black and Latinx lives and has had negative economic effects on black and Latinx workers . Environmental factors exacerbated by segregation ( like heavily polluted air or water full of lead ) , health conditions created by those environmental factors ( like heart disease , hypertension , and asthma ) , and constant stressors like the threat posed by police are contributing to poor health outcomes — outcomes that leave black Americans more susceptible to Covid-19 .
Add to that economic losses : Disinvestment in black and Latinx communities as well as inequities in education , transportation , and opportunity have led black and Latinx Americans to bear an unequal share of pay cuts and job losses .
There is also a regression in policy that has stemmed from the country ’ s leadership . Policies instituted to protect black lives have been systematically rolled back in recent years , from the return of mandatory minimum sentences to the Department of Justice refusing to conduct oversight of police departments accused of civil rights violations and President Donald Trump signing an executive order once again allowing police easy access to military equipment .
The realities of illness , unemployment , polluted air and water , unequal access to education , and mass incarceration — compounded with the fear of being killed by one of your fellow Americans or by a mysterious and still unchecked disease — has life feeling particularly fragile and the world particularly dire . Many are fed up . They need to direct their rage . They can not live and suffer any longer as they once felt they had to .
The protesters are fighting against history , present injustices , and hearts that refuse to be changed
At the core of this rage is a legitimate fear for black Americans : the sense that they can be killed anywhere at any time by anyone , but especially by law enforcement . It is a feeling black Americans have carried for all of America ’ s history . And the fact that the feeling has persisted for so long , that it has passed through so many iterations — the casual and common brutality of slavery , the lynching terrorism that followed , the assassinations of the civil rights era , the police killings of today — has created a feeling of futility . That no effort , no matter how herculean — not marching a million people through the nation ’ s capital , not placing a black man at the head of government — will be enough .
This sort of frustration can only build so long before it becomes anger . And it has .
Americans have left their homes where they were told to shelter in place for safety to express that anger , to rage in the ways that feel right to them — chanting , marching , rattling barricades , seizing goods , writing on walls , creating art , climbing vehicles , breaking glass , setting fires .
They have done so in masses that reflected the diversity of the country they hope will change , a positive development given racism and police brutality aren ’ t a problem black people have that they need support to solve ; they are evils black people suffer with little control over — ills that can be destroyed only with the assistance of all those who make up society and those who consciously or unconsciously benefit from and perpetuate them .
In doing this , in acknowledging this , these protesters have begun to create a new movement — one that aims to rework society .
The breadth and weight of what protesters are fighting for is why they are not slowing down . In Ferguson ’ s 2014 uprisings , the unrest quieted when Michael Brown ’ s family requested people not protest on the day of his funeral . In Baltimore , protests dissipated in 2015 when charges were brought against the officers in Freddie Gray ’ s death . When charges were brought against former police officer Derek Chauvin — who has been charged with Floyd ’ s murder — on Friday , protests only ramped up . In fact , there were protests in cities from Atlanta to Chicago to San Diego only hours later . Over the weekend , despite nearly 20 percent of US citizens being under a curfew , people still took to the streets .
And those demonstrations happened not just in big cities but in towns and villages across the country , including ones that do not necessarily have large black populations : they happened in Normal , Illinois , and Laramie , Wyoming ; Naples , Florida , and Bend , Oregon ; and countless other places . These protests are a reminder that policing , systemic racism , and the legacy of slavery do not just affect cities and do not just affect black people — that there is something very wrong with American society , all of it , everywhere , and that people across the nation want something new .
Because of this , protesters are demanding life itself be changed — that policing be fairer and kinder , that biases be inspected and corrected , that lasting policies be implemented that erase inequality , and that all people be able to move through the country without experiencing existential dread .
President Trump ’ s policies have moved the US further from these goals . His rhetoric has been unhelpful as well , and his divisive words about the protests have been indicative of the divide between the protesters and what they are protesting .
He has encouraged law enforcement — celebrating their most aggressive tactics and tweeting that protesters who get too close to the White House would be met with “ vicious dogs ” and “ ominous weapons. ” He has quoted segregationists in making further threats , ones he later tried to claim were not meant to be threatening at all .
Rather than make any attempt to engage with the protesters or understand their demands , Trump has accused them of representing the “ depravity of the Radical Left , ” and of being “ looters and thugs , ” while using his Twitter account to highlight the activities of agitators , promote increased National Guard deployments , and call for “ LAW & ORDER ! ”
But perhaps the most illustrative example of how Trump typifies this divide is the manner in which George Floyd ’ s brother Philonise Floyd described a call he had with the president .
“ He didn ’ t give me an opportunity to even speak , ” Floyd said on MSNBC . “ It was hard . I was trying to talk to him , but he just kept , like , pushing me off , like , ‘ I don ’ t want to hear what you ’ re talking about . ’ ”
This is what the protests are pushing back against : a sense that many in power do not see the problem and do not want to hear it described — that despite so many shouts for change , no one who can make those changes is listening , be they policymakers or individuals with biases they won ’ t acknowledge , let alone address .
And whether the protests will make them listen is not yet clear .
Recent protests have brought limited change . Demonstrators hope this time will be different .
With the feeling of shouting into a void comes a hopelessness that has led to debate over the worth , effectiveness , and viability of the protests .
There have been many protests against police killing unarmed black men in recent years , some of which have gone on for weeks , like the 2017 St. Louis protests over the killing of Anthony Lamar Smith by former police officer Jason Stockley , and , of course , Ferguson . Out of those protests have come the Black Lives Matter movement , other advocacy initiatives , and even some changes to police department policies .
But the data shows that black lives continue to be taken , including by police who often face few to no consequences for doing so .
A recent analysis by the advocacy group Mapping Police Violence found that 99 percent of police killings from 2013 to 2019 did not result in officers even being charged with a crime . A recent study by researchers at Rutgers University , the University of Michigan , and Washington University in St. Louis — explained by my colleague Dylan Scott — found black men have a 1 in 1,000 chance of being killed by police .
Statistics like these have led to questions over whether these latest protests can foster a change earlier demonstrations did not , and — as lawmakers of all ethnicities condemn the more aggressive approaches some have embraced , like setting fires and seizing property — whether some escalation in tactics would be wise .
Many , as Nikole Hannah-Jones of the New York Times did in a thread on Twitter , have argued that past protests that brought about change have involved violence , and that even the nonviolent protests of the 1960s relied on black Americans inviting violence to make their point :
Peaceful protest did not bring about the great civil rights legislation of the 1960s . Black people being firebombed , water-hosed , lynched , bitten by dogs , beaten to a pulp by police trying to march across a bridge is what brought the changes . Violence . — Ida Bae Wells ( @ nhannahjones ) May 29 , 2020
Those protests , Hannah-Jones wrote , showed that “ Black Americans must * absorb * white violence in order to benefit from white sympathy . At some point , communities say no and face the consequences . ”
Others , like Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms , have called for more measured protests ; after property was damaged across the city , Bottoms said , “ This is not a protest . This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King , Jr . This is chaos . ”
This tension exists among those out in the streets as well , as captured in a video that has gone viral , featuring two men discussing the protests :
It is a debate that has yet to be settled , and one that ties into another ongoing question about the protests : If no change comes , will they be sustained , or will they dissipate in the next few weeks , or even days ?
On one hand , one of the things the protests are against — police brutality — has been a prominent feature of the demonstrations so far . Police and the National Guard , with the aid of military equipment , have left protesters and observers bloodied . They have been recorded pulling people from cars and throwing bystanders , including elderly ones , to the ground . Being confronted so directly with what they are protesting would seem to give demonstrators more reasons to continue their uprisings .
And given their broad scope , one conviction or arrest won ’ t calm anyone ’ s anger . Much has also been made of the demographics of crowds , of peaceful white protesters and of white agitators — a larger coalition would seem to be more self-sustaining than a smaller one .
On the other hand , however , it is not clear how long protesters will be willing to continue their demonstrations if nothing moves forward — if the officers involved with Floyd ’ s death are not convicted , if Breonna Taylor ’ s killer goes free , if the government continues its escalations of force , and if deaths like Floyd ’ s and Taylor ’ s and Reed ’ s continue .
This is clearly an important point in time , and one arrived at after decades of trauma . But we will have to wait and see if this is the point at which change actually happens .

They’ve been attacked by police, tear-gassed, and arrested, and have marched shoulder to shoulder amid a deadly pandemic. Their demand: an end to racism, police brutality, and the attitudes and policies that allow both to exist.

We have seen uprisings over racism and police brutality before, the most famous being the civil rights movement of the 1960s. There was sometimes a sense that those uprisings had brought on a great deal of progress in a short period and that the eradication of systemic racism would be a long-term project from then on out, with incremental changes ensuring the arc of the moral universe bent toward justice. The recent protest movement — though nascent — seems to reject that idea. The protesters want change now.

And it is easy to see why: Systemic racism takes a physical, existential toll on communities of color.

There is the police violence itself — most recently, against George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died after a white police officer pinned him down by the neck with his knee for nearly nine minutes. Among Floyd’s final words were “I can’t breathe,” mirroring the last moments of Eric Garner, another unarmed black man who died after a white police officer squeezed his neck for 15 seconds in 2014.

Floyd’s killing followed the killing of Breonna Taylor by police in her own home, the shooting of Sean Reed in Indiana, the shooting of Tony McDade in Florida, and the extrajudicial killing of Ahmaud Arbery by a white father and son, the former a retired police detective, now charged with murder and aggravated assault.

Beyond the recent spate of police killings, there is, of course, Covid-19, a disease that has disproportionately taken black and Latinx lives and has had negative economic effects on black and Latinx workers. Environmental factors exacerbated by segregation (like heavily polluted air or water full of lead), health conditions created by those environmental factors (like heart disease, hypertension, and asthma), and constant stressors like the threat posed by police are contributing to poor health outcomes — outcomes that leave black Americans more susceptible to Covid-19.

Add to that economic losses: Disinvestment in black and Latinx communities as well as inequities in education, transportation, and opportunity have led black and Latinx Americans to bear an unequal share of pay cuts and job losses.

There is also a regression in policy that has stemmed from the country’s leadership. Policies instituted to protect black lives have been systematically rolled back in recent years, from the return of mandatory minimum sentences to the Department of Justice refusing to conduct oversight of police departments accused of civil rights violations and President Donald Trump signing an executive order once again allowing police easy access to military equipment.

The realities of illness, unemployment, polluted air and water, unequal access to education, and mass incarceration — compounded with the fear of being killed by one of your fellow Americans or by a mysterious and still unchecked disease — has life feeling particularly fragile and the world particularly dire. Many are fed up. They need to direct their rage. They cannot live and suffer any longer as they once felt they had to.

The protesters are fighting against history, present injustices, and hearts that refuse to be changed

At the core of this rage is a legitimate fear for black Americans: the sense that they can be killed anywhere at any time by anyone, but especially by law enforcement. It is a feeling black Americans have carried for all of America’s history. And the fact that the feeling has persisted for so long, that it has passed through so many iterations — the casual and common brutality of slavery, the lynching terrorism that followed, the assassinations of the civil rights era, the police killings of today — has created a feeling of futility. That no effort, no matter how herculean — not marching a million people through the nation’s capital, not placing a black man at the head of government — will be enough.

This sort of frustration can only build so long before it becomes anger. And it has.

Americans have left their homes where they were told to shelter in place for safety to express that anger, to rage in the ways that feel right to them — chanting, marching, rattling barricades, seizing goods, writing on walls, creating art, climbing vehicles, breaking glass, setting fires.

They have done so in masses that reflected the diversity of the country they hope will change, a positive development given racism and police brutality aren’t a problem black people have that they need support to solve; they are evils black people suffer with little control over — ills that can be destroyed only with the assistance of all those who make up society and those who consciously or unconsciously benefit from and perpetuate them.

In doing this, in acknowledging this, these protesters have begun to create a new movement — one that aims to rework society.

The breadth and weight of what protesters are fighting for is why they are not slowing down. In Ferguson’s 2014 uprisings, the unrest quieted when Michael Brown’s family requested people not protest on the day of his funeral. In Baltimore, protests dissipated in 2015 when charges were brought against the officers in Freddie Gray’s death. When charges were brought against former police officer Derek Chauvin — who has been charged with Floyd’s murder — on Friday, protests only ramped up. In fact, there were protests in cities from Atlanta to Chicago to San Diego only hours later. Over the weekend, despite nearly 20 percent of US citizens being under a curfew, people still took to the streets.

And those demonstrations happened not just in big cities but in towns and villages across the country, including ones that do not necessarily have large black populations: they happened in Normal, Illinois, and Laramie, Wyoming; Naples, Florida, and Bend, Oregon; and countless other places. These protests are a reminder that policing, systemic racism, and the legacy of slavery do not just affect cities and do not just affect black people — that there is something very wrong with American society, all of it, everywhere, and that people across the nation want something new.

Because of this, protesters are demanding life itself be changed — that policing be fairer and kinder, that biases be inspected and corrected, that lasting policies be implemented that erase inequality, and that all people be able to move through the country without experiencing existential dread.

President Trump’s policies have moved the US further from these goals. His rhetoric has been unhelpful as well, and his divisive words about the protests have been indicative of the divide between the protesters and what they are protesting.

He has encouraged law enforcement — celebrating their most aggressive tactics and tweeting that protesters who get too close to the White House would be met with “vicious dogs” and “ominous weapons.” He has quoted segregationists in making further threats, ones he later tried to claim were not meant to be threatening at all.
