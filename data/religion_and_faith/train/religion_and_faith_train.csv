During our time together both outside and inside the Oval Office , the president had a lot on his mind . It led to a wide-ranging interview that touched on numerous topics including the coronavirus , racial tensions , his poll numbers , John Bolton , the Supreme Court and even accusations of treason against President Obama .

David Brody : `` If Joe Biden gets elected President of the United States , what does that mean for America , exactly ? ''
President Trump : `` Well , I can tell you what it means for your religion . It means choice . It means that you 're going to put a radical Lefty on the Court and that 's going to be the end of pro-life , it wo n't even have a chance . So , that 's what it means . As you know , nobody has been more pro-life as president than I have . ''
President Trump : `` If Biden gets in , look , he 's not going to do it . Joe is shot . Somebody , whoever is going to be running the party is going to put radical Left judges on the Supreme Court and all over the court system . I think I 'll have close to 300 judges by the time I finish my first term , hopefully , a lot more than that , but it 's a record number and we have pro-life judges , and you look at the Supreme Court , they 're pro-life , so we 'll see what happens .

David Brody : `` What do you think of what happened with Neil Gorsuch in the 6-3 decision with the LGBT civil rights ? That was a shock to a lot of folks . ''
President Trump : `` I was surprised . I was surprised . Some people felt that it was a decision that they were n't as surprised as I was , yeah I was surprised . ''
David Brody : `` And John Roberts ? Is he the new Anthony Kennedy ? Or potentially worse ? ''
President Trump : `` Well , so far we 're not doing too well . It says , look , we 've had a lot of losses with a Court that was supposed to be in our favor . This is just to show what it means . You know , you 'll probably have a couple of more judges in the next four years , it could even be more than that , could be three or four . If you have a radical Left group of judges , religion I think will be almost wiped out in America . If you look at it , pro-life will be absolutely wiped out . So if you have that happening , pro-life is going to be out . It 's going to be gone . ''
David Brody : `` What do you make of the state of the race right now ? We 've seen polls , even some friendly polls showing you behind . Do you buy any of that ? ''
President Trump : `` I do n't because I see much enthusiasm right now . I see so much enthusiasm and a lot of it in terms of what you 're talking about , has to do with the whole pro-life movement . A lot of it has to do with that , but I think we 're doing much better than we did in '16 . And I think there 's actually more enthusiasm than there was in '16 . ''
President Trump : `` I just think it . I feel it . I mean , I see it . Now we got hit with this horrible pandemic , but we 've done a great job . We came up with testing , frankly , we test so much that it 's almost unfair , you know , when they say cases were 25 million tests , and other countries are barely even testing . ''
David Brody : `` At the Tulsa rally when the media is hitting you on that where you said , ' I told my staff stop the testing , ' they 're saying 'was that tongue-in-cheek ' or ... ? ''
President Trump : `` No . It 's semi tongue-in-cheek . I say it all the time . I know some people thought it was tongue-in-cheek . It 's unfair . We 're doing so much testing , so much more than any other country . And to be honest with you , when you do more testing , you find more cases . And then they report our cases are through the roof . But other countries , many countries do n't even test with real quality outside of you know , people that are very sick . So we go out and we test 25 million people , which is a lot , you never thought that was even possible . Most people did n't . And we could go up a lot higher than that . And I guess we are , but I tell my people , it 's a double-edged sword because we do so much testing . And again , we have kids with sniffles and all of a sudden we report a case and they 're are in no danger whatsoever . You know , if you look at the numbers , below 18 , very few people are affected . The governor of New Jersey who is a very good guy but very liberal . That 's okay . He was telling me thousands of deaths . And they only had one under 18 . Think of it . One young person who died under the age of 18 , with thousands of deaths so that tells you their immune system or something is doing well . And the one person did have a medical problem . ''
David Brody : `` But just to clear up , there was n't a direct order , if you will , to staff , to stop the testing . ''
President Trump : `` No . But I think we put ourselves at a disadvantage . ''
David Brody : `` I do n't want to talk about the John Bolton book , but he did say something in that book about the media . He said something about you saying journalists should be jailed and then executed . I mean , you want to respond to that ? ''
President Trump : `` He made it up . Look , he 's admitted that he will lie . He 's admitted that . There was a report that I saw where he will admit that he will lie in order to get the job done and he lied . I gave John Bolton a great opportunity and by the way , many of the things he said there were many other people in the room because it 's not like I 'm alone with one person . I have a lot of big delegations with me and they 've got a big delegation . And Steve Mnuchin came out and Mike Pompeo came out and Mick Mulvaney came out . They all came out , and they said , it 's a lie . ''
David Brody : `` On Obama and the spying situation , this idea that they were spying on your campaign , you 've been asked before about what crime he would have potentially committed . ''
David Brody : `` Well , that 's what I was going to ask you . ''
President Trump : `` It 's treason . Look , when I came out a long time ago , I said they 've been spying on our campaign . They 've been 'taping ' , that was in quotes , meaning a modern-day version of 'taping ' , they were spying on my campaign , I told you that a long time ago . It turned out I was right . Let 's see what happens to them now . I never met Durham because I want to stay out of it because otherwise , it 's going to look political , but as you know , Durham is a highly respected person and Bill Barr is doing a great job as Attorney General . Let 's see what they come up with but they do n't have to tell me . All I have to do is read the papers – the insurance policy – `` in case she does n't win , we have an insurance policy . '' Well , that was all the stuff that we went through over the last two and a half years . Now we 've caught them . We caught them cold . Strozk and Page , the two lovers , Brennan and Clapper the way they lied . ''
David Brody : `` Democrats ca n't stand Bill Barr . They think he 's political . ''
President Trump : `` You know why ? Because he 's doing such a good job because he 's law and order . He 's got them in his crosshairs , and now we have to see what 's going to happen . ''
David Brody : `` I want to turn to evangelicals for a little bit . Look , you 've done a boatload for evangelicals , for sure . And as a matter of fact , you 've over delivered for evangelicals ... ''
President Trump : `` More than any president in history by a factor of 10 . ''
David Brody : `` Yeah , I do n't think anybody would actually disagree with that . Let me ask you this about the law and order president and balancing that with compassion because the evangelicals that may want to go away from you , a percentage or two , will say they want to see more balance , especially with everything going on with George Floyd and coronavirus . So what is it exactly in that maybe in the future or what you 've done this administration from a compassion standpoint that people should be aware of ? ''
President Trump : `` Well , let me tell you . You have George Floyd . But you also have 14 people killed this weekend in Chicago . So you got to balance them out and say , wait a minute , we need law and order . And it 's run – all of these problems , Seattle , Portland , Chicago . You could go to Oakland , You could go to Baltimore . What do they have in common ? – They 're run by Liberal Democrats just like Joe Biden . Our nation will go to hell if he gets elected . Your 401K 's , which are now setting records , will go down , maybe to nothing , maybe to dust , because he 's going to raise everybody 's taxes . He has no idea what he 's doing anyway . You know that . He did n't when he was in primetime 20 years ago , you know , he never got more than 1 % . I used to call them `` 1 % Joe . '' And then Obama took them off the trash heap and it 's a fluke , nobody knows how this happened . He 's running against these other people , whether you like their views or not , they were competent . And he got through that whole mess , right ? And now he 's sitting in a basement , and he does n't want to come out . And this is what we 're going to have . If he got elected , China will own the United States . ''
David Brody : `` Do you think you 're the underdog in this race ? ''
President Trump : `` I do n't know . I think we have tremendous support . I really do . I think it 's the silent majority . There 's a silent majority . It happened last time . Remember the people came out and everyone said where did all these people come from ? And it really is , it 's a group of people that 's massive . And they work and they 're smart , and they 're brilliant . And they 're this and that , everything is good . And many evangelicals are in that group . You know , I got a tremendous evangelical support . I mean Christian support was incredible for me . It was incredible . And I think it should be better because before I was talking , even you said , Well , are you sure ? And I said , ' I 'm sure . ' But now I 've done it . Again . they said I 'm the most pro life president in history , by far , more so than Ronald Reagan . And so now I 've established my credentials , before I was just talking . You ought to ask a guy like a Biden or ask his campaign , give a list of judges , see where they stand on pro-life , see where they stand on it . You will not be able to get that list because they 're going to put an absolute radical Lefty in there in the Supreme Court and other judges . ''
Did God Pick Trump 'For Such a Time as This ' ?
David Brody : `` I want to ask you , on the evangelical front . I 've asked Sarah Sanders , Mike Pompeo , they all give me the same answer I say , 'Was President Trump put in office for such a time as this ? Did God put President Trump in office for such a time as this ? ' I never asked you that question . What do you think ? ''
President Trump : `` Well , I do n't know what they said specifically . ''
President Trump : `` Okay because Ben Carson said the same thing . You know , Ben Carson came to me because he ran a very effective campaign . And he did a good job . He really did . You know , he came in one of the top people . And he said to me , 'You know , you 're going to win . ' I said , 'Ben , I 'm running against you . What are you telling me ? ' He said , 'You 're going to win , because God put you here for this occasion . ' I said , 'what a lovely thing to say . ' That was the first one that I heard from Ben Carson . And it was during the campaign , I was running against him , and he was saying I 'm going to win . He 's a very high quality guy . He 's done a great job in the administration . ''
President Trump : `` I almost do n't even want to think about it because you know what ? I hope it 's true . All I 'm going to do is I 'm going to do my best and part of what I 'm doing my best on is for the religious community , beyond evangelical , evangelicals a very big part is very important to me . You know , we have great support . ''
`` I just hope I get tremendous evangelical Christian support and I 'm not saying this as a bragging thing , nobody has done more for religion than I have . Look what I 've done in Israel , which is a big thing with the evangelicals . ''
President Trump : `` In many respects , it is more important to the evangelicals than to Jewish people in this country . But look , what I 've done with the capital of Israel . You know , when you go into Jerusalem , what I 've done . Every president said they were going to make Jerusalem , the capital of Israel . And then when they got into office , they did n't do it . When I say every , many for decades , they 've all been campaigning . And I understand why . Because when I got into office , as soon as they thought I was even considering it , I was called by so many world leaders asking me in the strongest of terms , not to do it . And they all changed their mind . Not that they changed their mind , they just did n't do it . I did it . Golan Heights I did . You know , probably the biggest thing I did for Israel was Iran , breaking up that horrible deal made by President Obama $ 150 billion , $ 1.8 billion in cash . So I 've done a lot for religion , and I 've done a lot for the evangelicals , and I hope we can have your support and if Biden gets even 1 % , it would be terrible . And you can forget about the pro-life movement because it 'll be , it will be over . ''
David Brody : `` Mr. President , your time is valuable . Thank you . ''

Remember the people came out and everyone said where did all these people come from? And it really is, it's a group of people that's massive. And they work and they're smart, and they're brilliant. And they're this and that, everything is good. And many evangelicals are in that group. You know, I got a tremendous evangelical support. I mean Christian support was incredible for me. It was incredible. And I think it should be better because before I was talking, even you said, Well, are you sure? And I said, 'I'm sure.' But now I've done it. Again. they said I'm the most pro life president in history, by far, more so than Ronald Reagan. And so now I've established my credentials, before I was just talking. You ought to ask a guy like a Biden or ask his campaign, give a list of judges, see where they stand on pro-life, see where they stand on it. You will not be able to get that list because they're going to put an absolute radical Lefty in there in the Supreme Court and other judges.""

Did God Pick Trump 'For Such a Time as This'?



David Brody: ""I want to ask you, on the evangelical front. I've asked Sarah Sanders, Mike Pompeo, they all give me the same answer I say, 'Was President Trump put in office for such a time as this? Did God put President Trump in office for such a time as this?' I never asked you that question. What do you think?""



President Trump: ""Well, I don't know what they said specifically.""



David Brody: ""They said yes.""



President Trump: ""Okay because Ben Carson said the same thing. You know, Ben Carson came to me because he ran a very effective campaign. And he did a good job. He really did. You know, he came in one of the top people. And he said to me, 'You know, you're going to win.' I said, 'Ben, I'm running against you. What are you telling me?' He said, 'You're going to win, because God put you here for this occasion.' I said, 'what a lovely thing to say.' That was the first one that I heard from Ben Carson. And it was during the campaign, I was running against him, and he was saying I'm going to win. He's a very high quality guy. He's done a great job in the administration.""

David Brody: ""Do you buy that?""



President Trump: ""I almost don't even want to think about it because you know what? I hope it's true. All I'm going to do is I'm going to do my best and part of what I'm doing my best on is for the religious community, beyond evangelical, evangelicals a very big part is very important to me. You know, we have great support.""



""I just hope I get tremendous evangelical Christian support and I'm not saying this as a bragging thing, nobody has done more for religion than I have. Look what I've done in Israel, which is a big thing with the evangelicals.""



David Brody: ""Tier A.""



President Trump: ""In many respects, it is more important to the evangelicals than to Jewish people in this country. But look, what I've done with the capital of Israel. You know, when you go into Jerusalem, what I've done. Every president said they were going to make Jerusalem, the capital of Israel. And then when they got into office, they didn't do it. When I say every, many for decades, they've all been campaigning. And I understand why. Because when I got into office, as soon as they thought I was even considering it, I was called by so many world leaders asking me in the strongest of terms, not to do it. And they all changed their mind. Not that they changed their mind, they just didn't do it. I did it. Golan Heights I did. You know, probably the biggest thing I did for Israel was Iran, breaking up that horrible deal made by President Obama $150 billion, $1.8 billion in cash. So I've done a lot for religion, and I've done a lot for the evangelicals, and I hope we can have your support and if Biden gets even 1%, it would be terrible. And you can forget about the pro-life movement because it'll be, it will be over.""



David Brody: ""Mr. President, your time is valuable. Thank you.""



President Trump: ""Thank you so much, David.""



David Brody: ""Thank you so much.""

We are reliving the true history of how the Islamic world, much of which prior to the Islamic conquests was almost entirely Christian, came into being.

In 2003, Iraq’s Christian population was at least one million. Today fewer than 400,000 remain—the result of an anti-Christian campaign that began with the U.S. occupation of Iraq, when countless Christian churches were bombed and countless Christians killed, including by crucifixion and beheading.

The 2010 Baghdad church attack, which saw nearly 60 Christian worshippers slaughtered, is the tip of a decade-long iceberg.

Now, as the U.S. supports the jihad on Syria’s secular president Assad, the same pattern has come to Syria: entire regions and towns where Christians lived for centuries before Islam came into being have now been emptied, as the opposition targets Christians for kidnapping, plundering, and beheadings, all in compliance with mosque calls telling the populace that it’s a “sacred duty” to drive Christians away.

Iraq, Syria, and Egypt are part of the Arab world. But even in “black” African and “white” European nations with Muslim majorities, Christians are fleeing.

In Mali, after a 2012 Islamic coup, as many as 200,000 Christians fled. According to reports, “the church in Mali faces being eradicated,” especially in the north “where rebels want to establish an independent Islamist state and drive Christians out… there have been house to house searches for Christians who might be in hiding, churches and other Christian property have been looted or destroyed, and people tortured into revealing any Christian relatives.” At least one pastor was beheaded.

Even in European Bosnia, Christians are leaving en mass “amid mounting discrimination and Islamization.” Only 440,000 Catholics remain in the Balkan nation, half the prewar figure.

Problems cited are typical: “while dozens of mosques were built in the Bosnian capital Sarajevo, no building permissions [permits] were given for Christian churches.” “Time is running out as there is a worrisome rise in radicalism,” said one authority, who further added that the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina were “persecuted for centuries” after European powers “failed to support them in their struggle against the Ottoman Empire.”

And so history repeats itself.

One can go on and on:

In Ethiopia, after a Christian was accused of desecrating a Koran, thousands of Christians were forced to flee their homes when “Muslim extremists set fire to roughly 50 churches and dozens of Christian homes.”

In the Ivory Coast—where Christians have literally been crucified—Islamic rebels “massacred hundreds and displaced tens of thousands” of Christians.

In Libya, Islamic rebels forced several Christian religious orders, serving the sick and needy in the country since 1921, to flee.

To anyone following the plight of Christians under Islamic persecution, none of this is surprising.

Actions matter. Each public servant, including Vought, is required to support the Constitution regardless of his faith. If he were to violate the constitutional rights of any citizen he could and should be held to account — even if he believed his action to be religiously justified or compelled. But no senator can simply presume that Vought won’t comply with the Constitution because he believes only followers of Jesus Christ will receive salvation.

One final note: Sanders’s actions also show the fragility of one of our core constitutional protections. There is no right or ability to sue Sanders into compliance. He can vote however he chooses, and there is no cause of action to compel him to cleanse his mind of unconstitutional motivations when he casts those ballots. Thus, one of our nation’s most important traditions depends on Senators’ simply doing the right thing. But when our politics gets this polarized, it’s easy to justify ignoring the Constitution or rationalizing away its requirements for the sake of an alleged greater good. That’s what Sanders did here, and given the ignorance and intolerance that dominates our national debate, we can expect him — or others who think like him — to do it again.

His selection this week as Time Magazine’s Person of the Year is only the latest evidence that Jorge Mario Bergoglio has immutably impacted the Church in a startlingly short nine months.

More On This...

His public gestures – kissing disfigured visitors to the Vatican, lofting newborns with the endearing awkwardness of a non-parent, washing the feet of prisoners – may have been carefully staged, but they reveal the genuine character beneath the flowing white robes: Francis wants his church to serve, not strut.

He has made his concern for the poor – and hailing from Latin America, Jo knows po’ – his keystone and, predictably, paid the price of being misconstrued.

In Evangelii Gaudium, his first solo papal exhortation, Francis was widely quoted as deriding capitalist economies. Yet his complaint, a close reading would reveal, is that the pursuit of wealth, in and for itself, has become a competing religion. What parent in the now-infamous 1%, would not counsel his or her child that having money alone is not proof of success, but using it wisely is?

Even before that, Francis stated a simple, if uncomfortable, truth, when he acknowledged that the Church – and he meant the American Catholic Church -- obsessed unduly over issues like abortion, homosexuality and the ordination of women priests. To call Americans sex-obsessed is like saying Christmas has become too commercialized. Yet the pope’s truism was instantly and incorrectly interpreted as embracing gay marriage, abortion on demand, and females in celluloid collars. Like past popes, he is opposed to all those things, and will never change his mind about them.

So what does Francis believe? That the world is unfair and that the Catholic Church should be in the business of helping people. That while it is easy to look away from a victim of disease, disfigurement, or war, Catholics are obliged be the first to kiss, caress and concern themselves with such people. That corpulent priests and bishops might benefit from getting out of their limousines and walking among the people they are supposed to comfort.

Francis discomforts us, not because he is a communist who hates money – you’ll notice collections are still being taken up at mass – but because he speaks to our better selves, and calls us out when we fail to live up to our potential.

Little attention was paid to Section 152 of Evangelii Gaudium, in which the pope recommended that Catholics the world over – rich and poor, clever or not, white, black, yellow and brown – spend more time reading the Bible.

Here is something that few people know: Francis rises at an inordinately early hour to spend time, alone and unrecorded by TV cameras, reading scripture, over and over. It is from this quiet, reassuring time that his public persona finds the strength to challenge tradition and rattle the entrenched bureaucracy around him.

The little girl in my parish who marched up to the altar brought herself closer to God, despite embarrassing her mother. Francis embarrasses us, yet offers an example in himself. A few minutes of lost sleep, in the presence of divine wisdom, might benefit us all. Time’s Person of the Year was probably awake before you were today.

Pope Francis , who was elected by a secret conclave of cardinals gathered in the Vatican 's Sistine Chapel last week , was given a rapturous reception when he was driven around St. Peter ’ s Square in an open-topped popemobile at the start of the ceremony .
Under bright blue skies , Catholic faithful from around the world waved the flags of dozens of nations . The pope was accompanied by dozens of cardinals and archbishops wearing golden vestments that shone in the sunlight , as choirs sang Gregorian chants during the two-hour inauguration ceremony .
As tens of thousands of onlookers listened , many praised the dramatic change of style he has brought to the papacy , and waited for any hint of a major change for the Catholic Church in his first homily as pope . The new pope set out his vision for his papacy and the church as a whole by calling for greater compassion for the poor , the dispossessed , and the downtrodden .

“ No other religious order knows how to manage a global community like the Jesuits .

The election of a “ Jesuit Pope , ” who knows Europe and South America , Da Silva added , should lead to an interesting organizational period for the Church . `` It is worth noting that , historically , whenever the Catholic Church has wanted to change , it first changed its leader , rather than its structure , or its processes . ”","With traditional pomp and ceremony, the Catholic Church celebrated the official start of the papacy of Pope Francis on Tuesday, with a giant open-air mass in St. Peter’s Square.

Pope Francis, who was elected by a secret conclave of cardinals gathered in the Vatican's Sistine Chapel last week, was given a rapturous reception when he was driven around St. Peter’s Square in an open-topped popemobile at the start of the ceremony.

Under bright blue skies, Catholic faithful from around the world waved the flags of dozens of nations. The pope was accompanied by dozens of cardinals and archbishops wearing golden vestments that shone in the sunlight, as choirs sang Gregorian chants during the two-hour inauguration ceremony.

As tens of thousands of onlookers listened, many praised the dramatic change of style he has brought to the papacy, and waited for any hint of a major change for the Catholic Church in his first homily as pope. The new pope set out his vision for his papacy and the church as a whole by calling for greater compassion for the poor, the dispossessed, and the downtrodden.

“This was a general message, so he didn't get into specifics about how he might change the Church,"" says Robert Mickens, Vatican correspondent for The Tablet, a Catholic weekly.

""This is the big plan – mercy and compassion will be the keys to his pontificate.

The vocation of protector

The duty of caring for the weak and the poor fell not just on Christians but on all of humanity, he said.

“The vocation of being a 'protector,' however, is not just something involving us Christians alone; It also has a prior dimension which is simply human, involving everyone. It means respecting each of God’s creatures and respecting the environment in which we live. It means protecting people, showing loving concern for each and every person, especially children, the elderly, those in need, who are often the last we think about.""

He appealed to world leaders to make the protection of the environment a much stronger priority.

“I would like to ask all those who have positions of responsibility in economic, political, and social life, and all men and women of goodwill: Let us be 'protectors' of creation, protectors of God’s plan inscribed in nature, protectors of one another and of the environment.

The 85-year-old pontiff made the announcement Monday , saying he no longer had the strength to carry out his papal duties .
`` After having repeatedly examined my conscience before God , I have come to the certainty that my strengths , due to an advanced age , are no longer suited to an adequate exercise of the Petrine ministry , '' the pope said according to a statement released by the Vatican .
He said he is aware of the `` seriousness '' of his resignation , but that he did so in `` full freedom . '' He will live out his days on Vatican grounds , according to officials .
The last pope to resign was Pope Gregory XII , who stepped down in 1415 in a deal to end the Great Western Schism among competing papal claimants . The sudden announcement sets the stage for the Vatican to hold a conclave to elect a new pope by mid-March , since the traditional mourning time that would follow the death of a pope does n't have to be observed . There are several papal contenders in the wings , but no obvious front-runner , according to Vatican watchers .
A Vatican spokesperson told `` Fox & Friends '' that Pope Benedict `` will not take part in conclave '' to choose his successor . Officials hope to have a new pope in place in time for the start of Holy Week , on March 14 . Although there has been much speculation about Pope Benedict 's health , a Vatican spokesman said he is not in any immediate danger .
`` There 's nothing immediately serious or grave , '' the Vatican spokesman told ABC .
The pope 's 89-year-old brother , Georg Ratzinger , told a German news agency that the pope has had difficulty walking recently and has considered stepping down for months .
“ His age is weighing on him , ” Georg Ratzinger said . “ At this age my brother wants more rest . ”
Fox News Executive Vice President John Moody , former Vatican bureau chief for Time magazine , told Fox News Channel that Pope Benedict showed courage by accepting that the rigors of the papacy had become too much for him .
`` I think it is one of the bravest things I ’ ve ever heard of , '' said Moody , who is author of a 1996 biography of Pope John Paul II . `` Nobody gives up power willingly . Nobody gives up power without forethought . For this man , who really the world hasn ’ t gotten to know very well , despite the fact that he ’ s been around as pope for seven years , to do this speaks volumes about the kind of man he is and the kind of leader of the church that he insisted on being . ''
Born Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger , Pope Benedict became the 265th pope after being elected by his fellow cardinals on April 19 , 2005 , at the age of 78 following the death of the popular John Paul II . The ninth German pope and first in nearly 500 years , Benedict was ordained in 1951 and was a major figure at the Vatican stage for decades before his ascension .
Ratzinger chose the name Benedict , which comes from the Latin word meaning `` the blessed , '' in homage to Pope Benedict XV , who was pope during World War I , and Saint Benedict of Nursia , who established the Benedictine monasteries .
During his papacy and in the years prior , Benedict was a key figure in the church 's efforts to address widespread instances of sexual abuse of children by priests . In 2001 , then-Cardinal Ratzinger convinced John Paul II to put the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , which he led , in charge of investigating cases and setting policy regarding what he termed `` filth '' in the church . As a cardinal , Ratzinger pushed through important reforms , including making Internet offenses against children a violation covered by canon law , extending child abuse offenses to include the sexual abuse of all under 18 , waiving of the statute of limitation and speeding the process of dismissing guilty priests .
Even before becoming pope , Ratzinger had experienced health problems and attempted to resign from his role as prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith several times , only to stay on at the behest of Pope John Paul II . In 1991 , Ratzinger suffered a stroke , according to reports . After becoming pope , Benedict , who predicted a short tenure for himself , suffered another stroke in May 2005 , according to the Vatican . He is also believed to suffer from a heart condition .
As pope , Benedict embraced technology . In December , he began using Twitter , where he has 1.5 million followers .
`` We must trust in the mighty power of God ’ s mercy , '' read his most recent tweet , posted yesterday . `` We are all sinners , but His grace transforms us and makes us new .

""I think it is one of the bravest things I’ve ever heard of,"" said Moody, who is author of a 1996 biography of Pope John Paul II. ""Nobody gives up power willingly. Nobody gives up power without forethought. For this man, who really the world hasn’t gotten to know very well, despite the fact that he’s been around as pope for seven years, to do this speaks volumes about the kind of man he is and the kind of leader of the church that he insisted on being.""

Born Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger, Pope Benedict became the 265th pope after being elected by his fellow cardinals on April 19, 2005, at the age of 78 following the death of the popular John Paul II. The ninth German pope and first in nearly 500 years, Benedict was ordained in 1951 and was a major figure at the Vatican stage for decades before his ascension.

Ratzinger chose the name Benedict, which comes from the Latin word meaning ""the blessed,"" in homage to Pope Benedict XV, who was pope during World War I, and Saint Benedict of Nursia, who established the Benedictine monasteries.

During his papacy and in the years prior, Benedict was a key figure in the church's efforts to address widespread instances of sexual abuse of children by priests. In 2001, then-Cardinal Ratzinger convinced John Paul II to put the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which he led, in charge of investigating cases and setting policy regarding what he termed ""filth"" in the church. As a cardinal, Ratzinger pushed through important reforms, including making Internet offenses against children a violation covered by canon law, extending child abuse offenses to include the sexual abuse of all under 18, waiving of the statute of limitation and speeding the process of dismissing guilty priests.

Even before becoming pope, Ratzinger had experienced health problems and attempted to resign from his role as prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith several times, only to stay on at the behest of Pope John Paul II. In 1991, Ratzinger suffered a stroke, according to reports. After becoming pope, Benedict, who predicted a short tenure for himself, suffered another stroke in May 2005, according to the Vatican. He is also believed to suffer from a heart condition.

As pope, Benedict embraced technology. In December, he began using Twitter, where he has 1.5 million followers.

""We must trust in the mighty power of God’s mercy,"" read his most recent tweet, posted yesterday. ""We are all sinners, but His grace transforms us and makes us new.""

What is it with the pissant totalitarians in Colorado?

Jack Phillips is a baker. He is also a Christian. He declined to bake a wedding cake for a homosexual couple, who, instead of going to the bakery down the street, brought in the state government to try to force him to.

The U.S. Supreme Court ultimately held that Colorado’s so-called Civil Rights Commission had, in targeting Phillips, acted on a foundation of “religious hostility on the part of the State itself.” A second action against Phillips was dropped when the outlaw baker countersued.

Autumn Scardina, who was the complainant in the second action against Phillips, is now pursuing a third, having asked for a birthday cake to celebrate a gender transition.

The Church and related Catholic charities and schools have collected more than $ 1.6 billion since 2012 in U.S. contracts and grants in a far-reaching relationship that spans from school lunches for grammar school students to contracts across the globe to care for the poor and needy at the expense of Uncle Sam , a ███ review of federal spending records shows .

Johnson ’ s “ War on Poverty , ” and the charities “ imbued with their new faith in the government ’ s potential to solve social problems , eagerly accepted government money , ” Mr. Anderson wrote in an essay for the Manhattan Institute .
Catholic Charities received nearly a quarter of its funding from government by the end of the 1960s , more than half by the late 1970s and more than 60 percent by the mid-1980s , the level where it has remained ever since , Mr. Anderson said .

However , Mr. Anderson argues , because the Catholic Church and its charities are so ingrained in the U.S. government ’ s welfare system , it ’ s hard to reform and better it .

“ If a religious institution is required to do something that is in conflict of its religious views , it may opt out from receiving federal funding or make the pragmatic decision to stay in to get the funding , ” said Mr. Lenkowsky .
For example , most of the Catholic charities in Illinois have decided to close down their adoption programs rather than comply with a state requirement that says they can no longer receive state funding if they turn away same-sex couples for adoptive services or foster care .

We can not do this alone , ” the group said in a statement to The Times .
The nation is better off having Catholic charities participate in the federal welfare system than the alternative of having only secular organization and the government do it , Mr. Lenkowsky said .
“ Not only would Catholic charities be hurt , but our society would be much worse off because these services would be provided by government employees and secular service agencies run by social workers , ” Mr. Lenkowsky said . “ There ’ s certain things Catholic charities can do that social workers can ’ t do , like pastoral counseling — a minister trained to give counseling to people facing critical issues like substance abuse . ”

Witness Raju Singh Sonny told AFP that a man dressed in a police uniform burst into the temple in central Kabul, shot a guard and started attacking worshippers in the main hall.

""Several other attackers also entered the building and they were going from room to room shooting people,"" Sonny said.

But in many ways , the shift in national demographics has been accelerated beyond even that . New data from the American Values Atlas shows that while white people continue to be the majority in all but 4 states in the country , white Christians are the minority in a whopping 19 states . And , nationwide , Americans who identify as Protestant are now in the minority for the first time ever , clocking in at a mere 47 percent of Americans and falling .
The most obvious reason for this change is growing racial diversity . Most Americans still identify as Christian , but “ Christian ” is a group that is less white and less Protestant than it has been at any time in history . The massive growth in Hispanic Catholics , in particular , has been a major factor in this shift in the ethnic and religious identity of this country . White Catholics used to outnumber Hispanic Catholics 3 to 1 in the 2000s , but now it ’ s only by a 2 to 1 margin .
But another major reason religious diversity is outpacing the growth of racial/ethnic diversity is largely due to the explosive growth in non-belief among Americans . One in five Americans now identifies as religiously unaffiliated . In 13 states , the “ nones ” are the largest religious group . Non-religious people now equal Catholics in number , and their proportion is likely to grow dramatically , as young people are by far the most non-religious group in the country . This isn ’ t some kind of side effect of their youth , either . As Adam Lee has noted , the millennial generation is becoming less religious as they age .
These changes explain the modern political landscape as well as any economic indicator . While not all white Christians are conservative , these changing numbers definitely suggest that conservative Christians are rapidly losing their grip on power . And while some non-white Christians are conservative , their numbers are not making up for what the Christian right is losing . And whether conservative leaders are aware of the exact numbers or not , it ’ s clear that they sense that change is in the air . Just by speaking to young people , turning on your TV , or reading the Internet , you can sense the way the country is lurching away from conservative Christian values and towards a more liberal , secular outlook . And conservative Christians aren ’ t taking these changes well at all .
To look at the Christian right now is to see a people who know they are losing power and are desperately trying to reassert dominance before it ’ s lost altogether . The most obvious example of this is the frenzy of anti-abortion activity in recent years . Anti-choice forces have controlled the Republican Party since the late '70s , but only in the past few years have they concentrated so singlemindedly on trying to destroy legal abortion in wide swaths of the country . In 2011 alone , states passed nearly three times as many abortion restrictions as they had in any previous year .
None of this is a reaction to any changes in people ’ s sexual behavior or reproductive choices . It ’ s not like there was a spike in abortions causing this panic . In fact , the abortion rate has been declining . And despite continuing media panic over adolescent sexuality , the fact is that teenagers are waiting longer to have sex , on average , than in the past . Despite this , not only are you seeing a dramatic increase in attacks on legal abortion , the Christian right has expanded its attacks to contraception access , suggesting that something has worked them into a panic they believe can only be resolved by trying to reassert their religious and sexual values .
That something isn ’ t changes in sexual behavior , but it ’ s reasonable to believe it ’ s because of changes in sexual values . People might not be having more sex , but they are feeling less guilty about the sex they are having . Since Gallup first started polling people in 2001 on moral views , acceptance of consensual sex between adults has skyrocketed . In a decade ’ s time , acceptance of premarital sex swelled from 53 % to 66 % of Americans and acceptance of gay Americans grew from a mere 38 % to a majority of Americans . Even polyamory has become more acceptable for Americans , rising from being accepted by 5 % of Americans to 14 % .
The fact that these changes in attitude are rising alongside the growth of irreligiosity is not a coincidence . More perhaps even than the 1960s , Americans are in a period of questioning rigid sexual and religious mores , and concluding , in increasing numbers , that they are not down with guilt-tripping people for victimless behavior and demanding conformity for its own sake . Some of them -- now a whopping 22 % of Americans ! -- are leaving religion entirely . Some are continuing in their faith but choosing to interpret their values differently than Christian conservatives would like .
And so we see Christian conservatives cracking down in a desperate bid to regain control . They claim that they ’ re being oppressed by increasing tolerancefor religious diversity . They have latched onto , with some success , the claim that “ religious freedom ” requires giving Christians the right to oppress others . The Republican Party is in complete thrall to the religious right , to the point where giving the Christian right one go-nowhere symbolic bill instead of another one created a major political crisis .
The irony is that this panic-based overreach is just making the situation worse for the Christian right . One of the biggest reasons the secularization trend has accelerated in recent years is that young people see the victim complex and the sex policing of the Christian right and it ’ s turning them off . And they ’ re not just rejecting conservative Christianity but the entire idea of organized religion altogether . In other words , the past few years have created a self-perpetuating cycle : Christian conservatives , in a panic over changing demographics , start cracking down . In reaction , more people give up on religion . That causes the Christian right to panic more and crack down more . In the end , Christian conservatives are going to hasten their own demise by trying to save themselves .

The 150-year-old masterpiece of a church sits on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway , which cuts a swath through the city 's cultural center and is home to World Meeting of Families events taking place all weekend .
The masons who built the church placed windows only in the basilica 's uppermost story to protect worshipers from the anti-Catholic sentiment of the time . Francis invoked the basilica 's history of `` high walls and windows '' as he urged church leaders in the United States to devote more energy to reaching out to young people and those on the periphery of society .
In a nod to Pennsylvania 's homegrown saint , St. Katharine Drexel , Francis recounted Pope Leo 's words to her when she complained of the needs of the missions . Leo , whom the pontiff called `` a very wise pope , '' asked Drexel pointedly , `` What about you ? What are you going to do ? ''
`` Those words changed Katharine 's life , because they reminded her that , in the end , every Christian man and woman , by virtue of baptism , has received a mission , '' Francis said . `` Each one of us has to respond , as best we can , to the lord 's call to build up his body , the church . ''
Outside the basilica , Susan Suzi , from Hershey , Pa. , and Carmen and Ann Marie Zullo of New Jersey spent three hours on their feet , hoping to see the pope . The group stayed positive , even when their vantage point failed to yield a view when Francis left the church .
The trio arrived in Philadelphia on Monday to attend the eighth World Meeting of Families , a gathering that brings together 20,000 Catholics for a week of events .
`` The excitement is palpable , '' Ann Marie Zullo said . `` We 're part of something special here . ''
The pope 's two-day visit wraps up a six-day trip to the U.S. that has lured millions of exhilarated fans and plenty of the curious to line streets and pack venues for a glimpse of the charming , humble leader . He visited President Obama at the White House and gave a speech to Congress , spoke at the United Nations and said Mass at New York 's Madison Square Garden , then headed here to speak to and pray with the families . The 78-year-old Francis , who suffers from sciatica and a bad knee , has been walking with difficulty on his grueling trip that began with a four-day visit to Cuba . He has appeared to struggle on stairs , especially those on his chartered flights between cities . Father Federico Lombardi , the Vatican spokesman , said the pope 's physical troubles are not due to the grind of the most lengthy trip of his papacy . `` This is normal , this is something that he brings with him from his previous life , '' Lombardi said . `` This is all understandable for a man of his age . '' Lombardi said that Francis is buoyed by his contact with the faithful . The pope was greeted at the Philadelphia airport by a small but adoring crowd , plus church and political leaders . The special guests included a family of a city police officer who survived a shooting rampage that killed his partner . Richard Bowes said he was stunned when he learned the family was chosen .
`` Who thinks you are going to meet the pope , that you are going to be close enough to touch him ? '' Bowes said . `` It 's unbelievable . ''
The city was awash in barricades , law enforcement officers and smiling volunteers . Much of the downtown area was closed to traffic , and any cars left behind were towed away .
The pope 's day concluded with a `` Festival of Families '' event on the parkway , a broad boulevard expanse that runs from City Hall to the Art Museum and was fashioned , by Franklin himself , in the tradition of the iconic Avenue des Champs-Elysees in Paris . The event was hosted by actor Mark Wahlberg and featured musical performances by Aretha Franklin , Andrea Bocelli and others , as well as a parade of testimonials about the importance of family .
Francis addressed the crowd , saying in Spanish , `` Let us look after family , let us protect the family , because it 's in the family that our future is at play . ''
“ Father , you speak like that because you 're not married , '' Francis said , addressing those who might greet his message with skepticism . `` Families have difficulties . In families we quarrel . Sometimes , plates can fly . Children cause headaches . I wo n't speak of mother-in-laws .
On Sunday , Francis will meet with bishops at a local seminary , then visit with a group of inmates at the Curran-Fromhold Correctional Facility . The main event of the day , and perhaps the entire trip , will be a late afternoon Mass on the parkway expected to draw 1 million people .
At the conclusion of Saturday 's families event , Francis stood at a podium and told an adoring crowd , “ We ’ ll see each other at Mass tomorrow . '' Then he turned to aides and asked , `` What time is Mass ? ”
The crowd laughed as an aide told him , `` Four o ’ clock . ''
Where is Pope Francis ? A schedule of his U.S. visit
Not all the events here are church-sanctioned . Lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender Catholics were holding gatherings , one of which champions gay parents and their children . Francis has pleaded for compassion in the case of same-sex marriage and other family issues , but for many the church has not moved far enough .
Still , his themes of compassion , forgiveness and hope have resonated across a wide range of Catholics , lapsed Catholics , many who practice other faiths and those with no religious convictions at all .
Father James Bretzky , a theology professor at Boston College , said that bishops , who Francis calls the voice of the church , are getting the message , particularly after a speech Wednesday where the pope stressed that `` harsh and divisive language does not befit the tongue of a pastor . ''
`` It 's a hard course change though for many of them , '' Bretzky said . `` If the bishops had n't gotten the message before the meeting in D.C. , they certainly can no longer deny that they 've not heard the pope asking them to take a different tack . ''

PHILADELPHIA — The leader of the world's 1.2 billion Catholics brought his message of religious freedom and compassionate immigration to historic Independence Hall on Saturday, speaking in his native Spanish to a wildly receptive audience.

Francis invoked the basilica's history of ""high walls and windows"" as he urged church leaders in the United States to devote more energy to reaching out to young people and those on the periphery of society.

Wounded policeman, family to welcome pope to Philly

In a nod to Pennsylvania's homegrown saint, St. Katharine Drexel, Francis recounted Pope Leo's words to her when she complained of the needs of the missions. Leo, whom the pontiff called ""a very wise pope,"" asked Drexel pointedly, ""What about you? What are you going to do?""

""Those words changed Katharine's life, because they reminded her that, in the end, every Christian man and woman, by virtue of baptism, has received a mission,"" Francis said. ""Each one of us has to respond, as best we can, to the lord's call to build up his body, the church.""

Outside the basilica, Susan Suzi, from Hershey, Pa., and Carmen and Ann Marie Zullo of New Jersey spent three hours on their feet, hoping to see the pope. The group stayed positive, even when their vantage point failed to yield a view when Francis left the church.

The trio arrived in Philadelphia on Monday to attend the eighth World Meeting of Families, a gathering that brings together 20,000 Catholics for a week of events.

""The excitement is palpable,"" Ann Marie Zullo said. ""We're part of something special here.""

The pope's two-day visit wraps up a six-day trip to the U.S. that has lured millions of exhilarated fans and plenty of the curious to line streets and pack venues for a glimpse of the charming, humble leader. He visited President Obama at the White House and gave a speech to Congress, spoke at the United Nations and said Mass at New York's Madison Square Garden, then headed here to speak to and pray with the families. The 78-year-old Francis, who suffers from sciatica and a bad knee, has been walking with difficulty on his grueling trip that began with a four-day visit to Cuba. He has appeared to struggle on stairs, especially those on his chartered flights between cities. Father Federico Lombardi, the Vatican spokesman, said the pope's physical troubles are not due to the grind of the most lengthy trip of his papacy. ""This is normal, this is something that he brings with him from his previous life,"" Lombardi said. ""This is all understandable for a man of his age."" Lombardi said that Francis is buoyed by his contact with the faithful. The pope was greeted at the Philadelphia airport by a small but adoring crowd, plus church and political leaders. The special guests included a family of a city police officer who survived a shooting rampage that killed his partner. Richard Bowes said he was stunned when he learned the family was chosen.

""Who thinks you are going to meet the pope, that you are going to be close enough to touch him?"" Bowes said. ""It's unbelievable.""

The city was awash in barricades, law enforcement officers and smiling volunteers. Much of the downtown area was closed to traffic, and any cars left behind were towed away.

Pope Francis in America

The pope's day concluded with a ""Festival of Families"" event on the parkway, a broad boulevard expanse that runs from City Hall to the Art Museum and was fashioned, by Franklin himself, in the tradition of the iconic Avenue des Champs-Elysees in Paris. The event was hosted by actor Mark Wahlberg and featured musical performances by Aretha Franklin, Andrea Bocelli and others, as well as a parade of testimonials about the importance of family.

Francis addressed the crowd, saying in Spanish, ""Let us look after family, let us protect the family, because it's in the family that our future is at play.""

The pope called families “a factory of hope”

“Father, you speak like that because you're not married,"" Francis said, addressing those who might greet his message with skepticism. ""Families have difficulties. In families we quarrel. Sometimes, plates can fly. Children cause headaches. I won't speak of mother-in-laws.

""But in families, there is always light,"" he said.

On Sunday, Francis will meet with bishops at a local seminary, then visit with a group of inmates at the Curran-Fromhold Correctional Facility. The main event of the day, and perhaps the entire trip, will be a late afternoon Mass on the parkway expected to draw 1 million people.

At the conclusion of Saturday's families event, Francis stood at a podium and told an adoring crowd, “We’ll see each other at Mass tomorrow."" Then he turned to aides and asked, ""What time is Mass?”

The crowd laughed as an aide told him, ""Four o’clock.""

Where is Pope Francis? A schedule of his U.S. visit

Not all the events here are church-sanctioned. Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Catholics were holding gatherings, one of which champions gay parents and their children. Francis has pleaded for compassion in the case of same-sex marriage and other family issues, but for many the church has not moved far enough.

Still, his themes of compassion, forgiveness and hope have resonated across a wide range of Catholics, lapsed Catholics, many who practice other faiths and those with no religious convictions at all.

Father James Bretzky, a theology professor at Boston College, said that bishops, who Francis calls the voice of the church, are getting the message, particularly after a speech Wednesday where the pope stressed that ""harsh and divisive language does not befit the tongue of a pastor.""

""It's a hard course change though for many of them,"" Bretzky said. ""If the bishops hadn't gotten the message before the meeting in D.C., they certainly can no longer deny that they've not heard the pope asking them to take a different tack.""

On Friday , the Tennes family of Charlotte , Mich. , and their family-run orchard won a temporary reprieve . The city of East Lansing , Mich. , had banned them from the city ’ s farmer ’ s market because they refuse to host same-sex marriage ceremonies at their farm . In a decision granting the Tenneses ’ motion for a preliminary injunction , federal district-court judge Paul Maloney ordered East Lansing to “ allow the Plaintiffs to participate in the East Lansing Farmer ’ s Market for the remainder of the 2017 season . ”
Back in June , Stephen Tennes , who operates Country Mill Farms with his wife , Bridget , sued East Lansing after the city refused to let the family sell their produce at the farmer ’ s market , as they had done for the previous seven years . The Tenneses ’ complaint , filed in the Western District Court of Michigan , alleged seven separate federal constitutional claims , but Judge Maloney homed in on two of their legal theories in ordering relief — retaliation for engaging in protected speech and targeting the plaintiffs because of their religious beliefs .
Judge Maloney concluded that the Tenneses had a likelihood of success on the merits of their retaliation claim . As he explained , the government violates the First Amendment when it retaliates against a citizen for engaging in protected speech . Judge Maloney then laid out the history of the dispute between East Lansing and the Tenneses , which began in 2016 . In August of that year , a woman posted a message on Facebook urging people not to patronize Country Mill Farms because the Tenneses had refused to host a same-sex ceremony for her at the orchard . Two days later , the Tenneses posted a response on Facebook explaining that based on their Catholic faith , they do not host or participate in same-sex weddings at the family farm .
The city learned of the post almost immediately , and the mayor , Mark Meadows , and other city officials contacted the Tenneses and pressured them to voluntarily vacate their booth at the market . The Tenneses declined the request but , to avoid further controversy , decided to temporarily stop all booking of weddings at their orchard . The Tenneses informed the city of their decision and posted it on Facebook as well .
Mayor Meadows was not satisfied , though . In one email he wrote : “ I am not sure whether not hosting any weddings actually addresses the issue which is a public statement that their religion does not permit them to allow same sex couples to be married at their farm. ” However , the city had no means to ban the Tenneses from the farmers ’ market — at least not in 2016 .
After the farmer ’ s market closed for the season , two things changed . First , the Tenneses announced on Facebook that Country Mill Farms would begin hosting weddings again , but only for marriages between one man and one woman . And second , East Lansing amended the terms of its vendor agreements for the farmer ’ s market . The new version of the agreement required vendors to agree not to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation while operating at the farmer ’ s market “ and as a general business practice. ” East Lansing also directed the farmer ’ s market ’ s planning committee not to invite Country Mills Farms back for the 2017 season . The Tenneses nonetheless submitted a vendor agreement , which the city rejected .
The evidence , Judge Maloney ruled , created an inference that the city specifically targeted the Tenneses because of their religious beliefs .
Judge Maloney concluded that the mayor ’ s email , the city ’ s directive to the planning committee , and the amendment to the vendor agreement to take into account the Tenneses ’ business practices at their farm some 20 miles outside of East Lansing ’ s city limits , all indicate that the city sought to punish the Tenneses for speaking out on Facebook about their religious opposition to same-sex marriage , in violation of their First Amendment rights . These same facts , Judge Maloney concluded , demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of the Tenneses ’ free-exercise claim . Here , Judge Maloney stressed , the evidence created an inference that the city specifically targeted the Tenneses because of their religious beliefs . Accordingly , the court granted the Tenneses ’ motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered the city to allow the Tenneses to participate in the farmer ’ s market for the remainder of the 2017 season .
The court ’ s order provides the Tenneses with much-needed relief . But as Steve Tennes told the Daily Signal in a telephone interview last week : “ Since June 1 , we ’ ve already missed three and a half months of being able to attend East Lansing Farmer ’ s Market , where we ’ ve served everyone for the last seven years . Now we only have about six weeks left of the market to be able to sell , and the . . . East Lansing Farmer ’ s Market was the largest farmer ’ s market [ where ] our family sold organic apples and cider . ”
Further , the Tenneses ’ relief may prove fleeting , as East Lansing now has 30 days to appeal the lower court ’ s decision to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals . And even if the federal appellate court upholds Judge Maloney ’ s ruling , East Lansing could still prevail following a full trial .

Judge Maloney granted the Tenneses ’ motion for a preliminary injunction because East Lansing appeared to have targeted the Tenneses for their speech and religious views .

Can a Catholic couple live their faith and still sell apples at a farmer’s market?

On Friday, the Tennes family of Charlotte, Mich., and their family-run orchard won a temporary reprieve. The city of East Lansing, Mich., had banned them from the city’s farmer’s market because they refuse to host same-sex marriage ceremonies at their farm. In a decision granting the Tenneses’ motion for a preliminary injunction, federal district-court judge Paul Maloney ordered East Lansing to “allow the Plaintiffs to participate in the East Lansing Farmer’s Market for the remainder of the 2017 season.”

Terrorist organizations such as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria ( ISIS ) are destroying some of the oldest and most sacred Christian communities and relics in the world on the very lands where Christianity was born and first took root . They are committing brutal atrocities against Christian communities in Syria and Iraq , persecuting religious minorities and destroying entire towns and local economies . Christians are fleeing their homes in increasing numbers , creating an exploding refugee crisis that will have grave ramifications on the stability and security of the entire region .
While the world has been rightly outraged by the violence waged by ISIS against people of all sects , ethnicities , and religions , the United States , Europe and other key allies have done little to end ISIS ’ s systematic efforts to drive-out and eradicate entire religious communities from their historic and sacred homelands . The Obama Administration has repeatedly refused to defend religious freedom abroad and continues to ignore its devastating cost to those religious communities targeted by terrorists because of their religious beliefs .
As a nation founded in the pursuit of religious freedom , America can and must do more to root-out the religious intolerance that is helping to foster much of the political instability and violence we see today . Specifically , we believe the Obama Administration should integrate the protection of religious freedom into its overall response to growing terrorist threats and development efforts around the world . Doing so would help to eliminate the underlying causes of violent extremism , promote increased international economic stability , and foster greater respect for human rights .
Promoting religious freedom would , first and foremost , undermine the efforts of terrorist organizations such as ISIS to capitalize on simmering religious intolerance to build influence and wield power . ISIS has succeeded in tearing apart the social fabric of local communities and exacerbating sectarian and ethnic divisions to recruit supporters from disaffected populations and assert control over wide swaths of otherwise insecure territory . As a result , they have precipitated a breakdown of basic order that has allowed new and unprecedented security threats to the United States and our allies to fester and grow .
As a nation founded in the pursuit of religious freedom , America can and must do more to root-out the religious intolerance that is helping to foster much of the political instability and violence we see today .
The Obama administration can counter this strategy by building alliances with popular local and regional leaders who can expose these radical ideologies ’ moral bankruptcy and champion pluralism and tolerance . The Administration should also combat terrorist propaganda about religious minorities and develop programs that promote tolerance and empower minorities to better advocate for their rights and interests . Only by reaffirming the importance of religious freedom and working closely with communities and their governments will we be able to strip away sympathy and support for ISIS and other extremist groups that is bred from deeper political , economic , and social grievances .
Properly designed and implemented , a U.S. foreign policy committed to religious freedom can advance our national security interests , stabilize and consolidate the spread of democracy across the globe , help sustain economic growth , and promote the equality of men and women .
Most importantly , it can help prevent religiously-motivated terrorism and undermine the conditions that have helped spur the rise of groups like ISIS , Boko Haram , and the Shuddhikaran Movement .
Promoting religious freedom would also support the governance structures necessary for economic and political security in developing nations . As recent studies by groups such as the Religious Freedom and Business Foundation have found , higher levels of religious freedom are associated with higher levels of economic productivity and growth . Clearly , sustainable political and economic development is only possible when religious freedom and equal opportunity contributes to a secure environment in which citizens and businesses can operate freely .
Finally , we must remain committed to religious freedom because of the special distinction religious freedom holds as a fundamental human right—a belief that is shared by democratic countries across the globe and protected by numerous international treaties and agreements .
American support for religious liberty sends a potent and unmistakable message to threatened communities around the world : America is your friend . Such support builds enduring good will towards our country among those who could be leading their own nations in the years ahead . And it reminds all observers , whether friendly or hostile , that the U.S. remains committed to a world where justice and human dignity are central to legitimate governance .","Throughout the Middle East and North Africa today, Christianity is under attack.

The Administration should also combat terrorist propaganda about religious minorities and develop programs that promote tolerance and empower minorities to better advocate for their rights and interests. Only by reaffirming the importance of religious freedom and working closely with communities and their governments will we be able to strip away sympathy and support for ISIS and other extremist groups that is bred from deeper political, economic, and social grievances.

Properly designed and implemented, a U.S. foreign policy committed to religious freedom can advance our national security interests, stabilize and consolidate the spread of democracy across the globe, help sustain economic growth, and promote the equality of men and women.

Most importantly, it can help prevent religiously-motivated terrorism and undermine the conditions that have helped spur the rise of groups like ISIS, Boko Haram, and the Shuddhikaran Movement.

Promoting religious freedom would also support the governance structures necessary for economic and political security in developing nations. As recent studies by groups such as the Religious Freedom and Business Foundation have found, higher levels of religious freedom are associated with higher levels of economic productivity and growth. Clearly, sustainable political and economic development is only possible when religious freedom and equal opportunity contributes to a secure environment in which citizens and businesses can operate freely.

Finally, we must remain committed to religious freedom because of the special distinction religious freedom holds as a fundamental human right—a belief that is shared by democratic countries across the globe and protected by numerous international treaties and agreements.

American support for religious liberty sends a potent and unmistakable message to threatened communities around the world: America is your friend. Such support builds enduring good will towards our country among those who could be leading their own nations in the years ahead. And it reminds all observers, whether friendly or hostile, that the U.S. remains committed to a world where justice and human dignity are central to legitimate governance.",www.foxnews.com,right,xyr1xzK6pua97pt7

Darwin earned their hatred because he explained the evolution of life in a way that does n't require the hand of God . Darwin didn ’ t exclude God , of course , though many creationists seem incapable of grasping this point . But he didn ’ t require God , either , and that was enough to drive some people mad .
Darwin also didn ’ t have anything to say about how life got started in the first place — which still leaves a mighty big role for God to play , for those who are so inclined . But that could be about to change , and things could get a whole lot worse for creationists because of Jeremy England , a young MIT professor who 's proposed a theory , based in thermodynamics , showing that the emergence of life was not accidental , but necessary . `` [ U ] nder certain conditions , matter inexorably acquires the key physical attribute associated with life , '' he was quoted as saying in an article in Quanta magazine early in 2014 , that ’ s since been republished by Scientific American and , more recently , by Business Insider . In essence , he ’ s saying , life itself evolved out of simpler non-living systems .
The notion of an evolutionary process broader than life itself is not entirely new . Indeed , there ’ s evidence , recounted by Eric Havelock in `` The Liberal Temper in Greek Politics , '' that it was held by the pre-Socratic natural philosophers , who also first gave us the concept of the atom , among many other things . But unlike them or other earlier precursors , England has a specific , unifying , testable evolutionary mechanism in mind .
From the standpoint of physics , there is one essential difference between living things and inanimate clumps of carbon atoms : The former tend to be much better at capturing energy from their environment and dissipating that energy as heat . Jeremy England , a 31-year-old assistant professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , has derived a mathematical formula that he believes explains this capacity . The formula , based on established physics , indicates that when a group of atoms is driven by an external source of energy ( like the sun or chemical fuel ) and surrounded by a heat bath ( like the ocean or atmosphere ) , it will often gradually restructure itself in order to dissipate increasingly more energy . This could mean that under certain conditions , matter inexorably acquires the key physical attribute associated with life .
It doesn ’ t mean we should expect life everywhere in the universe — lack of a decent atmosphere or being too far from the sun still makes most of our solar system inhospitable for life with or without England ’ s perspective . But it does mean that “ under certain conditions ” where life is possible — as it is here on Earth , obviously — it is also quite probable , if not , ultimately , inevitable . Indeed , life on Earth could well have developed multiple times independently of each other , or all at once , or both . The first truly living organism could have had hundreds , perhaps thousands of siblings , all born not from a single physical parent , but from a physical system , literally pregnant with the possibility of producing life . And similar multiple births of life could have happened repeatedly at different points in time .
That also means that Earth-like planets circling other suns would have a much higher likelihood of carrying life as well . We ’ re fortunate to have substantial oceans as well as an atmosphere — the heat baths referred to above — but England ’ s theory suggests we could get life with just one of them — and even with much smaller versions , given enough time . Giordano Bruno , who was burnt at the stake for heresy in 1600 , was perhaps the first to take Copernicanism to its logical extension , speculating that stars were other suns , circled by other worlds , populated by beings like ourselves . His extreme minority view in his own time now looks better than ever , thanks to England .
If England ’ s theory works out , it will obviously be an epochal scientific advance . But on a lighter note , it will also be a fitting rebuke to pseudo-scientific creationists , who have long mistakenly claimed that thermodynamics disproves evolution ( here , for example ) , the exact opposite of what England ’ s work is designed to show — that thermodynamics drives evolution , starting even before life itself first appears , with a physics-based logic that applies equally to living and non-living matter .
Most important in this regard is the Second Law of Thermodynamics , which states that in any closed process , there is an increase in the total entropy ( roughly speaking , a measure of disorder ) . The increase in disorder is the opposite of increasing order due to evolution , the creationists reason , ergo — a contradiction ! Overlooking the crucial word “ closed , ” of course . There are various equivalent ways of stating the law , one of which is that energy can not pass from a cooler to a warmer body without extra work being done . Ginsberg 's theorem ( as in poet Allen Ginsberg ) puts it like this : `` You ca n't win . You ca n't break even . You ca n't even get out of the game . '' Although creationists have long mistakenly believed that evolution is a violation of the Second Law , actual scientists have not . For example , physicist Stephen G. Brush , writing for the American Physical Society in 2000 , in `` Creationism Versus Physical Science , '' noted : `` As Ludwig Boltzmann noted more than a century ago , thermodynamics correctly interpreted does not just allow Darwinian evolution , it favors it . ''
A simple explanation of this comes from a document in the thermodynamics FAQ subsection of TalkOrigins Archive ( the first and foremost online repository of reliable information on the creation/evolution controversy ) , which in part explains :
Creationists thus misinterpret the 2nd law to say that things invariably progress from order to disorder . However , they neglect the fact that life is not a closed system . The sun provides more than enough energy to drive things . If a mature tomato plant can have more usable energy than the seed it grew from , why should anyone expect that the next generation of tomatoes ca n't have more usable energy still ?
That passage goes right to the heart of the matter . Evolution is no more a violation of the Second Law than life itself is . A more extensive , lighthearted , non-technical treatment of the creationist ’ s misunderstanding and what ’ s really going on can be found here .
The driving flow of energy — whether from the sun or some other source — can give rise to what are known as dissipative structures , which are self-organized by the process of dissipating the energy that flows through them . Russian-born Belgian physical chemist Ilya Prigogine won the 1977 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work developing the concept . All living things are dissipative structures , as are many non-living things as well — cyclones , hurricanes and tornados , for example . Without explicitly using the term “ dissipative structures , ” the passage above went on to invoke them thus :
Snowflakes , sand dunes , tornadoes , stalactites , graded river beds , and lightning are just a few examples of order coming from disorder in nature ; none require an intelligent program to achieve that order . In any nontrivial system with lots of energy flowing through it , you are almost certain to find order arising somewhere in the system . If order from disorder is supposed to violate the 2nd law of thermodynamics , why is it ubiquitous in nature ?
In a very real sense , Prigogine ’ s work laid the foundations for what England is doing today , which is why it might be overstated to credit England with originating this theory , as several commentators at Quanta pointed out , noting other progenitors as well ( here , here and here , among others ) . But already England appears to have assembled a collection of analytical tools , along with a sophisticated multidisciplinary theoretical approach , which promises to do much more than simply propound a theory , but to generate a whole new research agenda giving detailed meaning to that theoretical conjecture . And that research agenda is already starting to produce results . ( See his research group home page for more . ) It ’ s the development of this sort of detailed body of specific mutually interrelated results that will distinguish England ’ s articulation of his theory from other earlier formulations that have not yet been translated into successful theory-testing research agendas .
Above all , as described on the home page mentioned above , England is involved in knitting together the understanding of life and various stages of life-like processes combining the perspectives of biology and physics : Living things are good at collecting information about their surroundings , and at putting that information to use through the ways they interact with their environment so as to survive and replicate themselves . Thus , talking about biology inevitably leads to talking about decision , purpose , and function . At the same time , living things are also made of atoms that , in and of themselves , have no particular function . Rather , molecules and the atoms from which they are built exhibit well-defined physical properties having to do with how they bounce off of , stick to , and combine with each other across space and over time .
Making sense of life at the molecular level is all about building a bridge between these two different ways of looking at the world .
If that sounds intriguing , you might enjoy this hour-long presentation of his work ( with splashes of local Swedish color ) — especially ( but not only ) if you ’ re a science nerd .
Whether or not England ’ s theory proves out in the end , he ’ s already doing quite a lot to build that bridge between worldviews and inspire others to make similar efforts . Science is not just about making new discoveries , but about seeing the world in new ways — which then makes new discoveries almost inevitable . And England has already succeeded in that . As the Quanta article explained :
England ’ s theoretical results are generally considered valid . It is his interpretation — that his formula represents the driving force behind a class of phenomena in nature that includes life — that remains unproven . But already , there are ideas about how to test that interpretation in the lab . “ He ’ s trying something radically different , ” said Mara Prentiss , a professor of physics at Harvard who is contemplating such an experiment after learning about England ’ s work . “ As an organizing lens , I think he has a fabulous idea . Right or wrong , it ’ s going to be very much worth the investigation . ”
Creationists often cast themselves as humble servants of God , and paint scientists as arrogant , know-it-all rebels against him . But , unsurprisingly , they ’ ve got it all backwards , once again .

During remarks Thursday , Trump said the order would prevent religious groups from being singled out for their political views .
`` We will not allow people of faith to be targeted , bullied or silenced anymore , '' Trump proclaimed , which were marking the National Day of Prayer . `` And we will never , ever stand for religious discrimination . Never , ever . ''
Trump 's language stood in contrast to certain steps his administration has taken to bar entry to citizens from some Muslim-majority nations and his campaign trail vows to stop all Muslims from entering the country .

In his remarks , Trump said that `` pastors , priests and imams '' were targeted by the Johnson amendment , and would be freer to engage in political activity under his executive order .
The 1954 Johnson amendment says any tax-exempt group can lose its exemption if it is found to have endorsed or actively opposed a candidate for political office . The IRS is officially tasked with investigating suspected violators of the law , though only one organization has lost its exemption as a result of IRS action in the six decades the law has been in place .
Legal experts said the order would not have a discernible effect on policy .
`` President Trump 's executive order did not ease the current restrictions on political activity by religious organizations , '' said Lawrence Noble , general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center . `` The executive order allows the IRS to restrict the activity it currently considers political , but prohibits the IRS from expanding the restrictions to cover activity not covered before the executive order . ''
The order , which declares that it is the policy of the Trump administration `` to protect and vigorously promote religious liberty , '' also stops short of offering broad exceptions for groups to deny services based on religious grounds .
An earlier version of the order , which had previously leaked to The Nation , would have provided sweeping legal protections for people to claim religious exemptions , provisions that civil liberties groups claimed would allow for discrimination against LGBT Americans .
`` America has a rich tradition of social change beginning in our pews and our pulpits , '' Trump said in front of an audience of religious leaders Thursday . `` We must never infringe on the noble tradition of change from the church and progress from the pew . ''
`` Under my administration , free speech does not end at the steps of a cathedral or a synagogue or any other house of worship , '' he went on . `` We are giving our churches their voices back and we are giving them back in the highest form . ''
Trump himself vowed early in his presidential tenure to get rid of the measure , though completely striking the amendment would require an act of Congress .
`` I will get rid of and totally destroy the Johnson amendment and allow our representatives of faith to speak freely and without fear of retribution , '' Trump said in February .
Some religious leaders , however , object to any measure that would make it easier to inject politics into places of worship .
`` For decades , the Johnson amendment has prevented houses of worship from being turned into partisan political tools . A majority of clergy -- and Americans -- support the status quo and oppose political endorsements from the pulpit , '' Interfaith Alliance president Rabbi Jack Moline said . `` President Trump 's executive order reportedly aims to gut the Johnson Amendment and clear the way for the Religious Right to weaponize their churches for partisan battle . ''
`` If the effort succeeds these churches would become conduits for unregulated 'dark money ' in elections , with no restrictions or disclosure requirements , '' he said .
In a letter delivered to House and Senate leaders last month , a group of religious leaders argued against scrapping the Johnson amendment , citing similar concerns that such a move could turn religious groups into political organizations .
`` The charitable sector , particularly houses of worship , should not become another cog in a political machine or another loophole in campaign finance laws , '' the group wrote .
Briefing reporters Wednesday evening , a senior Trump administration official downplayed the possibility that churches would soon act as political groups advocating for particular candidates .
`` Nobody is suggesting that churches are allowed , or it 's legal , for tax-exempt organizations to tax out ads endorsing candidates , '' the official said . `` That 's illegal now for them , as a condition of their tax-exempt status . So we 're not changing what 's legal , we 're not changing what 's illegal , just enforcement discretion . ''
Selectively enforcing law has drawn scrutiny in past administrations , and before the order was signed Wednesday , some experts predicted it could present another legal challenge to Trump 's administration .
The American Civil Liberties Union threatened the Trump administration with a lawsuit when details of the executive order emerged Wednesday .
But on Thursday , the group rescinded its threat , saying the order had no teeth .
`` It turned out the order signing was an elaborate photo-op with no discernible policy outcome , '' the organization tweeted . `` Trump 's assertion that he wished to 'totally destroy ' the Johnson amendment with this order has proven to be a textbook case of 'fake news .

Trump himself vowed early in his presidential tenure to get rid of the measure, though completely striking the amendment would require an act of Congress.

""I will get rid of and totally destroy the Johnson amendment and allow our representatives of faith to speak freely and without fear of retribution,"" Trump said in February.

Some religious leaders, however, object to any measure that would make it easier to inject politics into places of worship.

""For decades, the Johnson amendment has prevented houses of worship from being turned into partisan political tools. A majority of clergy -- and Americans -- support the status quo and oppose political endorsements from the pulpit,"" Interfaith Alliance president Rabbi Jack Moline said. ""President Trump's executive order reportedly aims to gut the Johnson Amendment and clear the way for the Religious Right to weaponize their churches for partisan battle.""

""If the effort succeeds these churches would become conduits for unregulated 'dark money' in elections, with no restrictions or disclosure requirements,"" he said.

In a letter delivered to House and Senate leaders last month, a group of religious leaders argued against scrapping the Johnson amendment, citing similar concerns that such a move could turn religious groups into political organizations.

""The charitable sector, particularly houses of worship, should not become another cog in a political machine or another loophole in campaign finance laws,"" the group wrote.

Briefing reporters Wednesday evening, a senior Trump administration official downplayed the possibility that churches would soon act as political groups advocating for particular candidates.

""Nobody is suggesting that churches are allowed, or it's legal, for tax-exempt organizations to tax out ads endorsing candidates,"" the official said. ""That's illegal now for them, as a condition of their tax-exempt status. So we're not changing what's legal, we're not changing what's illegal, just enforcement discretion.""

Selectively enforcing law has drawn scrutiny in past administrations, and before the order was signed Wednesday, some experts predicted it could present another legal challenge to Trump's administration.

The American Civil Liberties Union threatened the Trump administration with a lawsuit when details of the executive order emerged Wednesday.

But on Thursday, the group rescinded its threat, saying the order had no teeth.

""It turned out the order signing was an elaborate photo-op with no discernible policy outcome,"" the organization tweeted. ""Trump's assertion that he wished to 'totally destroy' the Johnson amendment with this order has proven to be a textbook case of 'fake news.'""

ANALYSIS/OPINION:

Everybody wants a piece of the pope. Fidel Castro and his little brother in crime applaud Pope Francis‘ assault on the very idea of capitalism, and Barack Obama wants to use the pontiff as a recruit in his war on what he perceives to be the “social injustice” of thwarting the Obama agenda and threatening the Obama legacy.

Gays think he may be secretly one of them, since he promised not to judge, and will soften hostility to homosexuality. No, no, say the defenders of marriage, he’ll strike a blow for tradition and common sense. If they’re all correct, the pope will have a busy week.

Everybody else in Washington, Philadelphia and New York City will just spend the week trying to find a way through crosstown traffic in the chaos that will be his most memorable gift to the tale of three cities. It’s not an easy week to be a Protestant who just wants to mind his own business.

The Castro brothers gave the pope a send-off from Havana in a burst of socialist solidarity. They didn’t go so far as to repress their police goons, who seemed to take a delight in roughing up dissenting Cubans who tried to participate in the pope’s celebration of Mass. Raul Castro delivered the usual long, boring Marxist speech commending himself, Cuba’s repressive government, his increasingly decrepit brother and the pope’s long devotion to left-wing politics.

“Cuba,” he said, has “founded an equitable society with social justice,” and praised the pontiff’s denunciation of America’s economic system that has “globalized capital and turned money into its idol.” He thanked Francis for softening up President Obama, as if softening up something soggy required much effort, and told the pope his next job is to persuade the Americans to suspend the trade embargo on Cuba, which he called “cruel, immoral and illegal” (forgetting only “fattening”).

He urged Francis to prescribe Cuba’s socialist model for building a society “focused on human beings and the family” and that he is “firmly determined to build a just and virtuous society with high ethical and spiritual values.” He even found a Catholic priest of the past, now safely dead, to praise. Cuba, he said with no hint of irony, “exercises religious freedom as a right consecrated in our constitution.” It’s religious freedom found nowhere else but on a piece of parchment, he might have said.

President Obama is fond of the sound of his own voice, too, but the pope is not likely to hear such long-winded and bitter boasts while he is in Washington. Perhaps later in the week, when he addresses the United Nations, he will hear a reprise of Marxist bloviation. There’s never a shortage of wind and noise where freeloaders and easy riders gather to sit in the lap of American luxury.

The pope can expect to enjoy better manners here, though some of his fellow Catholics in Congress have talked of boycotting his speech to a joint session of that redoubt of courtesy and decorum, where egos are ruthlessly suppressed and compassionate conservatism and kindly liberalism prevail at all times. The speaker, John Boehner, dismisses conservative critics as “garbage,” but few colleagues join him in drinking to that.

The closest to rudeness and insolence the pope is likely to suffer will be at the White House, where President Obama has assembled a congregation of gay caballeros, strident lesbians, the aggressively transgendered, abortionists, atheists, secularists and even a gay bishop from the Anglican splinter, to show the holy man the Catholics call “the vicar of Christ” what happy diversity looks like. He may never want to look again.

The White House, which may not know any better, has irritated the papal party not because of the assorted array of guests, but because it appears that representatives of the anti-abortion movement have been deliberately snubbed. Abortion, whether the White House likes it or not, is a high-priority cause for American bishops, and you might think that well-mannered people do not invite guests to dinner to offend them. But with this White House you never know.

Some of the bishops want the pope to address concerns, important not just to Catholics but to many in the Protestant majority as well, about the threats to religious liberty — the requirement in Obamacare to compel religious institutions to pay for abortions even if abortions violate strongly held faith beliefs.

Pope Francis will get his opportunity Saturday in Philadelphia, when he gives a speech at the Independence National Historical Park. He can get the last word.

Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Argentina , the humble 76-year-old son of a railway worker , was up bright and early on his first day as pontiff , visiting a church in Rome for private prayers .
The changes he is expected to bring to the Catholic Church are not likely to affect doctrine . Pope Francis is a doctrinal conservative like his predecessors Benedict XVI and John Paul II . Where he may make his mark is in his personal commitment to issues of inequality , including poverty and globalization , as well as in tapping his outsider status at the Vatican to promote reform .
His modest manner – as Archbishop of Buenos Aires he traveled by bus and eschewed the episcopal palace in favor of a small apartment – also raises the prospect of a radical culture clash with the pomp and circumstance of the Vatican , which is matched only by the British royal family for its love of costume , ceremony , and tradition .
There is an expectation that the first non-European pope for nearly 1,300 years and the first pontiff from the Americas could clear up the intrigue-ridden Curia , the powerful governing body of the Holy See .
`` Revolution at St. Peter 's '' said a headline in La Repubblica , with the Italian daily greeting Mr. Bergoglio ’ s election as the expression of a `` geographic and cultural upheaval '' for the Vatican .
Bergoglio 's election is being interpreted as a victory for reform-minded cardinals – prominent among them Americans such as Timothy Dolan of New York and Sean O ’ Malley of Boston – who were dismayed by the allegations of corruption and feuding in the Curia that emerged from the Vatileaks scandal last year , when Pope Benedict ’ s butler was caught stealing and leaking confidential documents .
It was a defeat for Odilo Scherer , the Archbishop of São Paolo in Brazil , who was the favored candidate of a bloc of cardinals , many of them Italian and working inside the Curia , who were highly resistant to reform , Vatican-watchers said .
The fact that Pope Francis is a Jesuit also may herald sweeping changes to the Holy See . The Jesuits have a reputation for rigorous and independent thought and for taking seriously their vows of poverty .
His decision to adopt the name Francis , recalling the asceticism of St. Francis of Assisi , was interpreted as hugely significant and another clue as to the direction in which he may try to steer the church .
Chris Bain , the chief executive of Cafod , a Catholic aid agency , was in St. Peter ’ s Square when white smoke puffed from the chimney on top of the Sistine Chapel and , an hour later , when the new pope made his first public appearance by stepping out onto the balcony of the imposing basilica .
“ The choice of the name Francis implies simplicity . He could of course be named after two great Francises : St. Francis of Assisi was about protecting the natural world , he was at one with nature . And St. Francis Xavier who was a great missionary . Both could be models for a new papacy , that is very telling , ” he says .
He comes from a working-class background – before immigrating to Italy , his father was a railway worker from Portacomaro , near the town of Asti in the northwestern region of Piedmont .
While Pope Benedict was renowned for his love of soft red leather loafers , which were handmade for him by cobblers in Rome , and ermine-lined vestments , Pope Francis is likely to bring a very different approach to the trappings of office .
“ He takes his vows of poverty very seriously . He refused to live in the bishop ’ s palace in Buenos Aires and instead moved into a small apartment where he cooks his own meals . He got rid of the chauffeur-driven limousine and took the bus to work , ” says the Rev . Thomas Reese , a Vatican expert at the Woodstock Theological Center at Georgetown University in Washington .
When he was made a cardinal by John Paul II in 2001 , his congregation collected money so they could accompany him on his trip to Rome . But he asked them all to stay at home in Argentina , to give the collection to the poor , and to let him travel to the Vatican on his own , noted Corriere della Sera , one of Italy ’ s leading newspapers , this morning .
“ It will be a challenge to live this sort of simple lifestyle in the Apostolic Palace , '' says Father Reese . `` I doubt this is the sort of pope who likes silk and furs . This may be very threatening to the papal court , especially those who like to dress up . ''
His reform-minded backers will expect him to do what his predecessor , Benedict , failed to do – tackle the dysfunction in the Curia , an issue that loomed large in the conclave , the secretive process by which Francis was elected by his 114 fellow cardinals in the Sistine Chapel .
He also faces the enormous challenge of rebuilding the church ’ s credibility on the issue of pedophile priests . Sex-abuse scandals have rocked the church worldwide in the last decade , beginning in the United States in 2002 .
“ The crisis was caused by secrecy , by cardinals promising not to reveal anything that would dishonor the church , ” says Anne Barrett Doyle , the codirector of Bishop Accountability , a US-based watchdog that has tracked the scandal of predatory priests . “ The most powerful thing a new pope could do would be to fire bishops who enabled child sex abuse to be committed by priests . If he chose 15 to 20 bishops , that would strike terror into many church officials . ”
On doctrinal matters , however , conservatives have nothing to fear from the Jesuit pope . “ He ’ s in total continuity with Benedict and John Paul II on theology and church teaching . We are not going to see women being ordained or approval for gay marriage , ” says Reese .
“ He ’ s very progressive on social justice issues and rights for the poor . He fought the Argentinian government on cutting benefits for poor people . He ’ s very concerned about the impact of globalization on workers in the developing world . This is not a candidate from Wall Street . ”
Jon O ’ Brien , president of Catholics for Choice , said in a statement : “ We welcome Pope Francis and look forward to hearing about his priorities in the coming days . We do not expect very many changes , but sincerely hope that the culture will change to better reflect the needs of the church and of Catholics .
“ We recall with fondness Pope John XXIII , who confronted the troubles of his day by convening the Second Vatican Council ‘ to open the windows of the church to let in some fresh air. ’ Pope Francis needs to go even farther and throw open the Vatican ’ s doors to shed some light on a bureaucracy that has allowed the management of the Vatican Bank and the sexual abuse crisis to get completely out of hand . ”
The debate on what sort of pope Pope Francis will be , and what he has in mind for the church , is only just beginning . Meanwhile , intriguing tidbits are emerging about the man himself . It turns out that he is a fan of tango , for instance .
`` I love tango and I used to dance when I was young , '' he told the authors of an authorized biography , `` The Jesuit , '' published in Spanish in 2010 .

religion_and_faith,Christian Science Monitor,1,https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2020/0414/Pastor-sharing-For-clergy-a-holy-hustle-and-labor-of-love,"Pastor-sharing: For clergy, a holy hustle and labor of love",2020-04-14,G. Jeffrey Macdonald,"Yet as pastor-sharing helps revive some small churches , it is also changing the culture in the pews in unexpected ways . Sharing clergy brings new partners into the life of a congregation , such as congregants of a sister church . As a Congregationalist churchgoer in rural Maine says , his pastor “ has the ability to make both churches feel like they are No . 1 . ”
Money is the main driver of the growing trend . Congregations that used to be able to afford full-time clergy can ’ t cover the costs of salary and benefits in a time of declining church attendance and lighter offering plates .
Pastor-sharing is happening across time zones and across denominations , from the mainline Protestant churches to Unitarian Universalism and Roman Catholic parishes . It ’ s a practice that requires stamina – just ask one New Hampshire Episcopal priest who races every Saturday in winter from a Mass atop Mount Sunapee , where he presides in black cassock and ski boots , to an indoor service 11 miles away in Newport , New Hampshire . The next morning , he ’ s in a third town for two more services .
The Rev . Susan Tierney had already done what would have been a good Sunday ’ s work for any clergyperson . Then she got up in front of her second congregation to do it all again .
She ’ d risen before dawn at her home in Pittsfield , drove 70 miles across rural western Maine , and led worship for 19 people huddled close ( pre-coronavirus outbreak ) at Weld Congregational Church on a crisp early March morning . No sooner had the benediction ended than she was in her red 2009 Subaru Forester , adding to the 177,000 miles on the odometer by racing around Mount Blue on a rutted 20-mile road to Phillips Congregational , her other church .
Now she was standing at a lectern before nine women and one man , all seated at tables in the church-owned community building , waiting for an encouraging word . They really needed it . Two blocks away , their hulkingly prominent white church sat empty , mothballed behind snow-covered steps .
The sermon she ’ d delivered in Weld wasn ’ t going to work here . Her call to confession from the Weld pulpit would have been too bracing in Phillips , an economically struggling town where defunct factories no longer churn out clothespins , matches , or shoes . Congregants had just voted in February to sell their church building and cut back on clergy-led worship from weekly to monthly . They could afford nothing more , but they felt guilty nonetheless about the ministry winding down on their watch . So the pastor customized a spiritual meal that she felt they needed .
“ Our Easter will come , and we will know it for the promise of God , who has promised us good things , ” Ms. Tierney assured her flock . “ But we will not see the dawn if we only look backwards toward the darkness . Rest in God ’ s love . That is your call for this Lent . ”
Ann Hermes/Staff Susan Tierney , who is the pastor of two different churches , leaves after conducting a Sunday service with the Phillips Congregational Church in a community center in Phillips , Maine . The old church building , where the congregation used to meet , is visible at the end of the road .
Ms. Tierney is symbolic of a centuries-old model of ministry that is making a comeback in the United States as individual pastors cater to multiple congregations in a time of financial and spiritual need . From Maine to California , Minnesota to Florida , congregations are sharing clergy as attendance declines and churches seek resourceful ways to sustain a variety of ministries .
The pastor-sharing is happening across time zones and across denominations , from the mainline Protestant churches to Unitarian Universalism and Roman Catholic parishes . It ’ s a practice that requires stamina – just ask one New Hampshire Episcopal priest who races every Saturday in winter from a Mass atop Mount Sunapee , where he presides in black cassock and ski boots , to an indoor service 11 miles away in Newport , New Hampshire . The next morning , he ’ s in a third town for two more services , starting at 8 a.m .
Yet pastor-sharing is helping to revive some small churches and changing the culture in the pews in unexpected ways . Does this brave new world of sharing clergy represent just a pragmatic solution to burdensome budgets ? Or is it part of a modest reinvention of American religion and its basic building block , the congregation ?
One thing is certain : The trend is growing . Some 44 % of the United Methodist Church ’ s 45,000 churches now share a pastor . In the United Church of Christ ( UCC ) , which includes Weld and Phillips among its 3,277 congregations , 11.1 % of churches share a pastor , up from 9.4 % in 2016 . Preliminary results from the not-yet-released 2018 National Congregations Study suggest the percentage of churches sharing pastors might be climbing across mainline Protestantism as a whole , according to NCS Director Mark Chaves of Duke University .
The main driver is money . Congregations that used to be able to afford full-time clergy can ’ t cover the costs of salary and benefits in a time of declining church attendance and lighter offering plates . In 2018 , fully 43 % of mainline churches already had no full-time clergy all to themselves , according to NCS preliminary data that suggest many work a second job , either religious or secular . The coronavirus-induced economic crisis of 2020 is apt to push that percentage even higher .
Such pressures are rekindling a shared ministry model that helped build America ’ s church landscape . Anglicans routinely shared clergy in Colonial days because trained priests were too scarce for every church to have its own , according to E. Brooks Holifield , author of “ God ’ s Ambassadors : A History of the Christian Clergy in America. ” One church might sponsor as many as nine chapels that a priest would visit occasionally to administer sacraments . As the frontier was settled , Methodists assigned preachers to circuits , or a string of churches that the horse-riding clerics would check on and feed with word and sacrament every few weeks .
The shared pastor model “ goes back a long way , but it ’ s coming back , ” says Mr. Holifield , a historian of American religion .
While population shifts are helping to fuel the trend today , as it did back then , it now comes with a new twist . Mainline congregations are no longer sharing clergy in an ambitious bid to reach a growing country . Burdened with aging church buildings and other costly structures , they ’ re trying to scale back to a sustainable footprint , especially in small towns that are losing residents .
“ It looks the same [ as in centuries past ] , but the underlying dynamics are different , ” Mr. Holifield says . “ In the early 19th century , the issue was rapid geographical expansion . In the 21st century , the issue is more one of contraction – having to cut back on things so that churches that once were able to afford a full-time pastor often now can not . ”

Moving to shared clergy means a church is reaching beyond its walls for new support , but to what end can vary widely . Depending on the setting , it can be a way to keep church doors open or launch an experimental format . No matter what the circumstances , it challenges pastors and congregants alike to set priorities and accept trade-offs .
All of that is on display in America ’ s most secular region , New England . From rural corners to urban downtowns , congregations are entering new stages of life with pastors who aren ’ t theirs alone . And they ’ re finding that means a lot more relationships come to bear on shaping their futures .
Inside a stone church off the main road in Newport , a congregation of 17 gathers for worship on a Saturday at 5 p.m. even though there ’ s no fixed furniture to sit on . The pews at Church of the Epiphany were removed , along with assumptions that every church needs a priest all to itself , as part of a relaunch of the congregation in 2017 .
Chancel and pulpit , once reserved for a choir and collared cleric , now go unused . Instead the Rev . Jay MacLeod – who also serves as rector of St. Andrew ’ s Episcopal Church in New London , New Hampshire – mills among the people , animatedly preaching to them in a partial circle of folding chairs before leading the congregation to the altar for Holy Communion .
Epiphany hasn ’ t always had so many signs of fresh thinking and new life . The church had dwindled to about a dozen people before its part-time priest suddenly retired in 2015 after a family tragedy . The future was uncertain for this cash-strapped congregation in a town struggling with poverty .
“ Epiphany had a choice to make , ” says Aaron Jenkyn , who coordinates outreach and pastoral care at Epiphany and St. Andrew ’ s . “ They had to decide if they were going to shut down , join with another church , or push through and make some big changes to the way that they were doing church . And they bravely chose to make big changes . ”
Teaming up to share a priest with St. Andrew ’ s , a larger and more affluent parish , has been as significant as moving worship to Saturdays , renovating interior space , and launching two after-school enrichment programs . One reason : Congregations that share a priest qualify for grants that they otherwise couldn ’ t get , according to Tina Pickering , canon for ministry development in the Episcopal Diocese of New Hampshire . With grant support , Epiphany is able to provide free music lessons and 4-H programming for neighborhood young people from low-income homes .
The church feels it ’ s getting a bargain . For $ 9,000 a year , it gets Mr. MacLeod sometimes after school for the music program , for pastoral support in times of crisis , and every Saturday for Mass . In winter , he officiates in ski pants because he ’ s just been atop Mount Sunapee serving Holy Communion to skiers . Nobody seems to mind the informality .
“ We want to see this parish survive , ” says Epiphany member Gene Jannenga . “ The only way we ’ re going to be able to do it is to do what ’ s happening in other parts of this region ” by forging partnerships , including priest-sharing .
The arrangement seems to be working . Average weekend attendance has doubled since 2015 , to 24 . Once a month for worship , the congregation offers Messy Church , a popular casual , intergenerational format that drew 65 to Epiphany one Saturday in February .
For Mr. MacLeod ’ s part , hustling between churches can contribute to feeling emotionally and physically fatigued , he says . But working with young people in Newport is a highlight of his week . The ambitious schedule also fits his personality : A Rhodes scholar with three degrees , he enjoys being challenged .
What makes the partnership tough at times is the long-standing class divide between St. Andrew ’ s and Epiphany .
“ Prone to an inward-looking , country club ethos , St. Andrew ’ s needed to develop a stronger sense of its own vocation , ” Mr. MacLeod says in an email . “ St . Andrew ’ s supports ministries in Haiti , Honduras , the Middle East , and Navajoland as well as disadvantaged Boston youngsters , but supporting our neighboring parish in Newport has probably raised more eyebrows . I suspect most people are coming around . ”
Sharing a priest has helped bridge that gap , churchgoers say , because Mr. MacLeod ’ s two flocks rub elbows in ministry trenches . Dozens from St. Andrew ’ s volunteer at Epiphany ’ s programs for children , and they ’ re bringing insight back to New London . In January , for example , St. Andrew ’ s began hosting its own Messy Church once a month .
“ At first it was very awkward ” to volunteer alongside folks from St. Andrew ’ s , says Linda Radford , an Epiphany member since 1965 and a Newport resident . “ I ’ ve always felt like New London was a little above us , and they might look down on us a little bit . I think that was difficult at first , but now I don ’ t feel that . ”
Kate Valleli has always belonged to a Lutheran church and wants the same for her three children . When she was growing up , her military family would find the flock in every community in which they lived . It kept them connected to their German Lutheran roots , to new friends , and to God .
What makes the family tradition sustainable in central Massachusetts , where the Vallelis now live , is a pastor-sharing arrangement between two congregations that couldn ’ t afford a full-time clergyperson on their own .
Because Zion Lutheran in Worcester and Bethel Lutheran in Auburn have teamed up , the family takes part in youth programming at Bethel and urban outreach at Zion . The unifying factor is their pastor , Andrew Borden , who serves both churches under the auspices of Grace Ministries , a framework in which Zion and Bethel act as yoked congregations employing him together .
“ If it were just this campus , there would be fewer and fewer outreach programs happening because of the demographics , ” with Zion ’ s aging makeup , Ms. Valleli says , as she serves shepherd ’ s pie at Zion ’ s neighborhood meals program for older people in Worcester . “ Pastor is trying to bridge that by bringing more able people from the other congregation to bring things alive here . ”
Stories like the Vallelis ’ affirm that the two churches offer more together than apart . It helps them survive the costs of maintaining multiple properties .
Melanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Pastor Borden leads congregants during a Wednesday evening service at Bethel Lutheran Church .
Mr. Borden tries to be present wherever he ’ s needed and spreads himself thin at times . When he leads midweek worship in Lent , he scrambles from the altar over to play the piano . He oversees at least four buildings as reflected in the jangling key ring on his belt loop . When a tenant lease needs renegotiating , he gets involved . And when services are closely scheduled , he arranges for a lay leader to start things off so that he can arrive partway through the service , don vestments , and step in .
“ I look at it as being one big parish with two geographical locations , ” Mr. Borden says . “ At one rehab facility , I might be visiting a person from one campus at 10 o ’ clock and see someone from the other campus there at 11 o ’ clock . For me , I don ’ t have to worry about ‘ am I giving time here or am I giving time there ’ because it ’ s all a blend . I just go and do . ”
The pastor-sharing comes at a price , however , for people like Bill Toombs , a retired garbage collector . He used to attend Lenten suppers weekly at Zion , his neighborhood church . Those seasonal sessions still happen , but every other week they ’ re now at Bethel . That means he has to load his octogenarian mother-in-law and her wheelchair into a van for the 9-mile ride to Auburn if they want to take part .
Time with the pastor can be hard to get , too , Mr. Toombs says . He likes to talk with Mr. Borden about common interests or changes in family life , but seldom gets a chance .
“ He gets done here at quarter to 10 and he has to be down there at 10 o ’ clock , ” Mr. Toombs says at a lunch for neighborhood seniors at Zion . “ Sometimes you have something like a death in the family and want to talk to him , but he ’ s running out the door to the next church . ”
Mr. Borden has been trying to make the arrangement work since 2015 when Zion , where he ’ s been since 2007 , could no longer afford to pay him full time . Zion pays more of his salary than Bethel does , but Bethel has the larger and younger congregation . So which one gets him at prime hours on major holiday events like Christmas Eve ?
“ There ’ s a really strong preference for ‘ well , we need the early service [ at Zion ] because we have 30 people for dinner and it starts at 6 o ’ clock , ’ ” Ms. Valleli says . “ People are just rigid about – you can ’ t change that . But if we have a bigger congregation over there [ at Bethel ] and a bigger turnout , that ’ s where he ’ s going to be . ”
Sharing a pastor can mean revitalizing a congregation or helping one wind down . In Weld and Phillips , Ms. Tierney is doing both at the same time . Like many rural flocks , the Congregational church in tiny Weld ( pop . 419 ) has struggled at times to survive financially .
A few years ago , parishioners were worshipping in the parsonage all winter so they wouldn ’ t have to heat the main church building . But having a shared pastor arrangement has helped free up funds , including for building expenses . The congregation now holds services in its classic white-steepled church building even on chilly winter days , with fleece blankets offered on pews for extra warmth .
Switching back to the traditional venue has helped attract relatively new members such as Tom Skolfield , who felt the church should meet in its meetinghouse . And having a pastor who specializes in tending to small congregations has been a bonus .
“ She has the ability to make both churches feel like they are No . 1 , ” says church member Mike Pratt .
Average Sunday attendance at the Weld church has climbed from six in 2015 to about 25 now in cold weather months . In summer , attendance swells to between 30 and 50 on a typical Sunday . With a picturesque lake on one side and a popular state park on the other , Weld has benefited from its growing popularity with vacationers . They also tend to give generously .
Phillips Congregational Church had hoped Ms. Tierney ’ s presence could bear new fruit , much as it has in Weld , but sharing a pastor – even a small-church specialist – didn ’ t lead to similar results .
“ She came here to help us as a small church , but nothing seemed to make any difference here in this community , ” says Mary Dunham , a longtime church member . “ It didn ’ t increase our congregation at all . ”
Despite having the same pastor , the churches are moving in opposite directions . That ’ s partly because they ’ re barely connected . They happen to contract with the same clergyperson but don ’ t coordinate compensation or expectations . As Congregationalists in the UCC , they rely more on local governance than do Lutherans or Episcopalians .
Another reason is location . Weld is more stable economically than Phillips , which has battled decline for decades . The Phillips church ’ s history of sharing pastors with other congregations dates to the 1970s , when the community was losing manufacturers . Despite sharing pastors with churches of the UCC and the United Methodist Church through the years , nothing has reversed the fortunes of Phillips Congregational Church or the town .

“ When I was a kid growing up , Phillips had everything you could ever think of – it was a booming community , ” says Paul Gardiner , the son of two workers at Phillips ’ long-closed Diamond Match factory . “ We had a hardware store , movie theater , doctors , dentists , lawyers , and all that stuff . They ’ ve all gone . ”
After a career that ’ s included stints as a police officer , deputy sheriff , and fire chief in town , Mr. Gardiner now owns a lawn-care business and longs for a renewal of traditional values . “ Bunch of young kids don ’ t care about doing anything that the older people do , ” he says . “ How many young people bring their kids to church anymore ? ”
In March , Phillips Congregational entered yet another new phase . The church ended Ms. Tierney ’ s weekly sermons . Instead she will now visit once a month . During the pastor ’ s last time behind the pulpit on her regular schedule , two of the three members of the choir wept as they sang “ Keep Me Safe as the Storm Passes By . ”
“ I feel like we didn ’ t do enough to inspire people to be here , ” says Ms. Dunham . “ I mean , God is the center of my life . I can ’ t go a day without Him . I get up early just so I can read and start my day with Him . I just wish other people could feel what that does for them . ”
The pastor , in her own way , offered reassurance to Ms. Dunham and her fellow parishioners in her sermon . “ Do not use this time to struggle to figure out our situation or try to understand what comes next , ” Ms. Tierney said . “ What I ask of you in this season of Lent is just to rest in hope and take in nourishment from God ’ s always-devoted love . ”
As churches increasingly share pastors , they ’ re entering what promises to be an extended transition – one that can be challenging for both clergy and congregants .
“ The grief is over the loss of what once was and isn ’ t coming back , and [ the ] loss of identity , ” says Richard Simpson , canon to the ordinary in the Episcopal Diocese of Western Massachusetts . “ What makes this work [ of clergy-sharing ] hard is that the clergy themselves are going through it alongside the congregations they serve . ”
What emerges from these partnerships runs the gamut from the daunting to the invigorating to the experimental . Sharing clergy brings new partners into the life of a congregation , not only a pastor but also congregants of a sister church . This means more experiences , new sensibilities , and transformed church cultures – all of which factor into decision-making . And with more influences come more ideas and possibilities .

“ We are preparing ourselves for a new kind of life that we believe will be revealed to us , ” Ms. Tierney tells her flock in Phillips . “ Do not worry . Just look for signs of what we believe will be our spring rising . ”","Yet as pastor-sharing helps revive some small churches, it is also changing the culture in the pews in unexpected ways. Sharing clergy brings new partners into the life of a congregation, such as congregants of a sister church. As a Congregationalist churchgoer in rural Maine says, his pastor “has the ability to make both churches feel like they are No. 1.”

Money is the main driver of the growing trend. Congregations that used to be able to afford full-time clergy can’t cover the costs of salary and benefits in a time of declining church attendance and lighter offering plates.

Pastor-sharing is happening across time zones and across denominations, from the mainline Protestant churches to Unitarian Universalism and Roman Catholic parishes. It’s a practice that requires stamina – just ask one New Hampshire Episcopal priest who races every Saturday in winter from a Mass atop Mount Sunapee, where he presides in black cassock and ski boots, to an indoor service 11 miles away in Newport, New Hampshire. The next morning, he’s in a third town for two more services.

The Rev. Susan Tierney had already done what would have been a good Sunday’s work for any clergyperson. Then she got up in front of her second congregation to do it all again.

She’d risen before dawn at her home in Pittsfield, drove 70 miles across rural western Maine, and led worship for 19 people huddled close (pre-coronavirus outbreak) at Weld Congregational Church on a crisp early March morning. No sooner had the benediction ended than she was in her red 2009 Subaru Forester, adding to the 177,000 miles on the odometer by racing around Mount Blue on a rutted 20-mile road to Phillips Congregational, her other church.

Editor’s note: As a public service, we’ve removed the paywall for all our coronavirus coverage. It’s free.

Now she was standing at a lectern before nine women and one man, all seated at tables in the church-owned community building, waiting for an encouraging word. They really needed it. Two blocks away, their hulkingly prominent white church sat empty, mothballed behind snow-covered steps.

The sermon she’d delivered in Weld wasn’t going to work here. Her call to confession from the Weld pulpit would have been too bracing in Phillips, an economically struggling town where defunct factories no longer churn out clothespins, matches, or shoes. Congregants had just voted in February to sell their church building and cut back on clergy-led worship from weekly to monthly. They could afford nothing more, but they felt guilty nonetheless about the ministry winding down on their watch. So the pastor customized a spiritual meal that she felt they needed.

“Our Easter will come, and we will know it for the promise of God, who has promised us good things,” Ms. Tierney assured her flock. “But we will not see the dawn if we only look backwards toward the darkness. Rest in God’s love. That is your call for this Lent.”

Ann Hermes/Staff Susan Tierney, who is the pastor of two different churches, leaves after conducting a Sunday service with the Phillips Congregational Church in a community center in Phillips, Maine. The old church building, where the congregation used to meet, is visible at the end of the road.

Ms. Tierney is symbolic of a centuries-old model of ministry that is making a comeback in the United States as individual pastors cater to multiple congregations in a time of financial and spiritual need. From Maine to California, Minnesota to Florida, congregations are sharing clergy as attendance declines and churches seek resourceful ways to sustain a variety of ministries.

The pastor-sharing is happening across time zones and across denominations, from the mainline Protestant churches to Unitarian Universalism and Roman Catholic parishes. It’s a practice that requires stamina – just ask one New Hampshire Episcopal priest who races every Saturday in winter from a Mass atop Mount Sunapee, where he presides in black cassock and ski boots, to an indoor service 11 miles away in Newport, New Hampshire. The next morning, he’s in a third town for two more services, starting at 8 a.m.

Yet pastor-sharing is helping to revive some small churches and changing the culture in the pews in unexpected ways. Does this brave new world of sharing clergy represent just a pragmatic solution to burdensome budgets? Or is it part of a modest reinvention of American religion and its basic building block, the congregation?

One thing is certain: The trend is growing. Some 44% of the United Methodist Church’s 45,000 churches now share a pastor. In the United Church of Christ (UCC), which includes Weld and Phillips among its 3,277 congregations, 11.1% of churches share a pastor, up from 9.4% in 2016. Preliminary results from the not-yet-released 2018 National Congregations Study suggest the percentage of churches sharing pastors might be climbing across mainline Protestantism as a whole, according to NCS Director Mark Chaves of Duke University.

The main driver is money. Congregations that used to be able to afford full-time clergy can’t cover the costs of salary and benefits in a time of declining church attendance and lighter offering plates. In 2018, fully 43% of mainline churches already had no full-time clergy all to themselves, according to NCS preliminary data that suggest many work a second job, either religious or secular. The coronavirus-induced economic crisis of 2020 is apt to push that percentage even higher.

Tradition with a twist

Such pressures are rekindling a shared ministry model that helped build America’s church landscape. Anglicans routinely shared clergy in Colonial days because trained priests were too scarce for every church to have its own, according to E. Brooks Holifield, author of “God’s Ambassadors: A History of the Christian Clergy in America.” One church might sponsor as many as nine chapels that a priest would visit occasionally to administer sacraments. As the frontier was settled, Methodists assigned preachers to circuits, or a string of churches that the horse-riding clerics would check on and feed with word and sacrament every few weeks.

The shared pastor model “goes back a long way, but it’s coming back,” says Mr. Holifield, a historian of American religion.

While population shifts are helping to fuel the trend today, as it did back then, it now comes with a new twist. Mainline congregations are no longer sharing clergy in an ambitious bid to reach a growing country. Burdened with aging church buildings and other costly structures, they’re trying to scale back to a sustainable footprint, especially in small towns that are losing residents.

“It looks the same [as in centuries past], but the underlying dynamics are different,” Mr. Holifield says. “In the early 19th century, the issue was rapid geographical expansion. In the 21st century, the issue is more one of contraction – having to cut back on things so that churches that once were able to afford a full-time pastor often now cannot.”

Moving to shared clergy means a church is reaching beyond its walls for new support, but to what end can vary widely. Depending on the setting, it can be a way to keep church doors open or launch an experimental format. No matter what the circumstances, it challenges pastors and congregants alike to set priorities and accept trade-offs.

All of that is on display in America’s most secular region, New England. From rural corners to urban downtowns, congregations are entering new stages of life with pastors who aren’t theirs alone. And they’re finding that means a lot more relationships come to bear on shaping their futures.

Holy hustle

Inside a stone church off the main road in Newport, a congregation of 17 gathers for worship on a Saturday at 5 p.m. even though there’s no fixed furniture to sit on. The pews at Church of the Epiphany were removed, along with assumptions that every church needs a priest all to itself, as part of a relaunch of the congregation in 2017.

Chancel and pulpit, once reserved for a choir and collared cleric, now go unused. Instead the Rev. Jay MacLeod – who also serves as rector of St. Andrew’s Episcopal Church in New London, New Hampshire – mills among the people, animatedly preaching to them in a partial circle of folding chairs before leading the congregation to the altar for Holy Communion.

Epiphany hasn’t always had so many signs of fresh thinking and new life. The church had dwindled to about a dozen people before its part-time priest suddenly retired in 2015 after a family tragedy. The future was uncertain for this cash-strapped congregation in a town struggling with poverty.

“Epiphany had a choice to make,” says Aaron Jenkyn, who coordinates outreach and pastoral care at Epiphany and St. Andrew’s. “They had to decide if they were going to shut down, join with another church, or push through and make some big changes to the way that they were doing church. And they bravely chose to make big changes.”

Teaming up to share a priest with St. Andrew’s, a larger and more affluent parish, has been as significant as moving worship to Saturdays, renovating interior space, and launching two after-school enrichment programs. One reason: Congregations that share a priest qualify for grants that they otherwise couldn’t get, according to Tina Pickering, canon for ministry development in the Episcopal Diocese of New Hampshire. With grant support, Epiphany is able to provide free music lessons and 4-H programming for neighborhood young people from low-income homes.

The church feels it’s getting a bargain. For $9,000 a year, it gets Mr. MacLeod sometimes after school for the music program, for pastoral support in times of crisis, and every Saturday for Mass. In winter, he officiates in ski pants because he’s just been atop Mount Sunapee serving Holy Communion to skiers. Nobody seems to mind the informality.

“We want to see this parish survive,” says Epiphany member Gene Jannenga. “The only way we’re going to be able to do it is to do what’s happening in other parts of this region” by forging partnerships, including priest-sharing.

The arrangement seems to be working. Average weekend attendance has doubled since 2015, to 24. Once a month for worship, the congregation offers Messy Church, a popular casual, intergenerational format that drew 65 to Epiphany one Saturday in February.

I suspect most people are coming around.”

Sharing a priest has helped bridge that gap, churchgoers say, because Mr. MacLeod’s two flocks rub elbows in ministry trenches. Dozens from St. Andrew’s volunteer at Epiphany’s programs for children, and they’re bringing insight back to New London. In January, for example, St. Andrew’s began hosting its own Messy Church once a month.

“At first it was very awkward” to volunteer alongside folks from St. Andrew’s, says Linda Radford, an Epiphany member since 1965 and a Newport resident. “I’ve always felt like New London was a little above us, and they might look down on us a little bit. I think that was difficult at first, but now I don’t feel that.”

‘One big parish’

Kate Valleli has always belonged to a Lutheran church and wants the same for her three children. When she was growing up, her military family would find the flock in every community in which they lived. It kept them connected to their German Lutheran roots, to new friends, and to God.

What makes the family tradition sustainable in central Massachusetts, where the Vallelis now live, is a pastor-sharing arrangement between two congregations that couldn’t afford a full-time clergyperson on their own.

Because Zion Lutheran in Worcester and Bethel Lutheran in Auburn have teamed up, the family takes part in youth programming at Bethel and urban outreach at Zion. The unifying factor is their pastor, Andrew Borden, who serves both churches under the auspices of Grace Ministries, a framework in which Zion and Bethel act as yoked congregations employing him together.

“If it were just this campus, there would be fewer and fewer outreach programs happening because of the demographics,” with Zion’s aging makeup, Ms. Valleli says, as she serves shepherd’s pie at Zion’s neighborhood meals program for older people in Worcester. “Pastor is trying to bridge that by bringing more able people from the other congregation to bring things alive here.”

Stories like the Vallelis’ affirm that the two churches offer more together than apart. It helps them survive the costs of maintaining multiple properties.

Despite sharing pastors with churches of the UCC and the United Methodist Church through the years, nothing has reversed the fortunes of Phillips Congregational Church or the town.

“When I was a kid growing up, Phillips had everything you could ever think of – it was a booming community,” says Paul Gardiner, the son of two workers at Phillips’ long-closed Diamond Match factory. “We had a hardware store, movie theater, doctors, dentists, lawyers, and all that stuff. They’ve all gone.”

After a career that’s included stints as a police officer, deputy sheriff, and fire chief in town, Mr. Gardiner now owns a lawn-care business and longs for a renewal of traditional values. “Bunch of young kids don’t care about doing anything that the older people do,” he says. “How many young people bring their kids to church anymore?”

The pastor, in her own way, offered reassurance to Ms. Dunham and her fellow parishioners in her sermon. “Do not use this time to struggle to figure out our situation or try to understand what comes next,” Ms. Tierney said. “What I ask of you in this season of Lent is just to rest in hope and take in nourishment from God’s always-devoted love.”

A culture transformed

As churches increasingly share pastors, they’re entering what promises to be an extended transition – one that can be challenging for both clergy and congregants.

“The grief is over the loss of what once was and isn’t coming back, and [the] loss of identity,” says Richard Simpson, canon to the ordinary in the Episcopal Diocese of Western Massachusetts. “What makes this work [of clergy-sharing] hard is that the clergy themselves are going through it alongside the congregations they serve.”

What emerges from these partnerships runs the gamut from the daunting to the invigorating to the experimental. Sharing clergy brings new partners into the life of a congregation, not only a pastor but also congregants of a sister church. This means more experiences, new sensibilities, and transformed church cultures – all of which factor into decision-making. And with more influences come more ideas and possibilities.

Evangelicals, Catholics, Jews and others gathered in the Rose Garden for a first-of-its-kind kickoff to the National Day of Prayer.

The president marked the occasion by making good on a campaign promise, signing an executive order designed to promote and protect religious liberty.

""We will not allow people of faith to be targeted, bullied or silenced anymore,"" he said to applause from the crowd.

The order does three things:

It states that it's the ""policy of the executive branch to vigorously enforce federal law's robust protections for religious freedom.""

It essentially orders the IRS to stop enforcing the Johnson Amendment, which forbids churches and other non-profits from supporting and endorsing candidates.

And it protects the conscience of employers who don't want to provide contraception and abortion-inducing drugs in their insurance plans that Obamacare mandated.

That includes employers like the Little Sisters of the Poor who sued the Obama administration. Several nuns with the order were in the audience and the president asked them to join him on stage.

""Your ordeal is over,"" he told them.

So Where Does It Fall Short?

Many evangelical leaders who've pushed Trump to sign an executive order call the president's actions an important first step. However, the order is light on details and falls short of what many were expecting.

According to Ryan T. Anderson, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, the first component of the order merely reiterates what's already in place — that is, that the government honor and enforce our religious liberty laws.

Regarding the second component, Anderson notes that language addressing the Johnson Amendment ""doesn't concern the most pressing religious liberties facing Americans.""

Finally, he takes exception to the fact that the order merely instructs agencies to ""consider"" new regulations, noting that the Supreme Court has already ""unanimously instructed the federal government to resolve the case of Little Sisters of the Poor and other HHS mandate cases.""

Anderson says the ball is now in Congress' court to take legislative action on these issues.

""Congress should give President Trump the opportunity to sign robust religious liberty protections,"" Anderson writes in The Hill.

Other faith leaders admit they're also disappointed in Trump's executive action.

Trump's order was enough to rattle many on the Left. Some say it could lead to discrimination against gays, same-sex couples, and women.

Libertarians generally take a live-and-let-live approach, advocating freedom of association over anti-discrimination mandates. Moreover, a key aspect of libertarian policy is a commitment to choice and consent in personal and business relationships.

This approach is embodied in the Libertarian Party's 2016 platform, which reads: ""Libertarians embrace the concept that all people are born with certain inherent rights.

But surely there is also harm when an American is forced to participate in an event that is contrary to his or her deeply held beliefs. A voluntary, market-oriented approach is the best way to reconcile the competing interests in such situations.

NEGATIVE:

Cake Baking Simply Is Not Speech

Eugene Volokh

The Free Speech Clause, the Supreme Court has long held, protects the freedom not to speak as well as the freedom to speak. And this freedom not to speak must include the freedom not to create speech, and not to participate in others' speech.

A freelance writer shouldn't be forced to write press releases for the Church of Scientology, even if he's willing to work for other religious groups. A musician shouldn't be forced to play at Republican-themed events, even if he plays at other political events, and even in a city (such as Seattle or D.C.) that bans businesses from discriminating based on political affiliation. Likewise, a photographer shouldn't be forced to create photographs celebrating a same-sex wedding, and a wedding singer shouldn't be forced to sing at such a celebration.

But this right must have its limits. It is a free speech clause, not a freedom of action clause, and courts thus must distinguish speech (and a limited zone of symbolic expression that is basically tantamount to speech) from other behavior.

The Free Speech Clause doesn't give a limo driver a legal right not to drive a couple from their same-sex wedding. It doesn't give a chef a right not to serve certain people at his restaurant. Subway calls its sandwich makers ""sandwich artists,"" but that doesn't give it a Free Speech Clause right to discriminate among would-be patrons of such arts. The same is true for bakers, even ones who create beautiful cakes for use at weddings. It is generally constitutional—whether or not wise or just—for the law to compel behavior, and only a small subset of such compulsions violates freedom of speech.

Courts have recognized the need to distinguish speech from conduct when it comes to speech restrictions, and the Supreme Court has rejected ""the view that an apparently limitless variety of conduct can be labeled 'speech' whenever the person engaging in the conduct intends thereby to express an idea."" A city would violate the First Amendment by, say, restricting the number of newspapers or freelance writers that may operate there. But a city may limit the number of butchers or cab drivers—unwise as such regulations usually are—because those activities aren't treated as speech.

The same is true for restaurants or bakeries, even ones that create beautiful dishes or beautiful cakes. And if a restriction on the ability to bake cakes isn't a speech restriction, then a requirement to bake cakes (even for ceremonies one disapproves of) isn't a speech compulsion.

Now, requiring a baker to make a cake containing pro–gay marriage text or pro–gay marriage symbolic expression—pictures of two grooms or a rainbow motif, say—would indeed be compelled speech. But in the Masterpiece Cakeshop case, the baker apparently refused to make any cake for a same-sex wedding, without even discussing the design. That's a refusal to do, not a refusal to speak.

Nor is it enough that wedding cakes are supposed to be aesthetically pleasing. Hairstyles are similarly aesthetic, and can convey links to particular attitudes. But a hairdresser who, for instance, refuses to do cornrows for a white customer or refuses to cut a woman's hair in what he sees as an improperly masculine style can't claim a First Amendment freedom from compelled speech. For every Masterpiece Cakeshop there is a Masterpiece Hair and a Masterpiece M.D. plastic surgeon—and even a Masterpiece Limousine and a Masterpiece Plumbing (all real business names). The Free Speech Clause does not protect them all.

To be sure, if you believe religious objectors should be presumptively exempted from generally applicable laws—for instance, under the Free Exercise Clause—you might think this covers bakers who think it's sinful to prepare cakes for same-sex weddings. (That would then raise difficult questions about when the presumption of religious exemption can be rebutted.) But the Supreme Court has held that the Free Exercise Clause doesn't secure such a right; that provision generally protects only against deliberate religious discrimination by the government. (The Court in the Masterpiece Cakeshop case found evidence of such discrimination in the Colorado proceedings, but that won't be so in many other similar cases.) The federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), which authorizes some such exemptions, doesn't apply to state laws. And Colorado doesn't have its own RFRA.

Our Constitution isn't a libertarian document. It is a document that creates a charter for democratic government, with some protection for specific individual liberties, but generally in specific, identified zones.

When it comes to cultural issues, there is no center-left.

I’m old enough to remember when religious-liberty lawyers were a quirky, somewhat cool, and tiny (very tiny!) subset of the legal profession. They were the guys who’d skipped out on the law-firm bucks and instead spent their days making sure that the faithful folks on the fringes of American life didn’t get a raw deal. They kept the dominant American cultural Christians honest.

religion_and_faith,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/5/5/15536838/executive-order-religious-liberty-johnson-amendment-trump,Trump's executive order on religious liberty doesn't come close to his campaign promises,2017-05-05,"Alissa Wilkinson, Alexia Fernández Campbell, Aaron Rupar, Marie Cascione, Hannah Brown, Ella Nilsen, Umair Irfan, German Lopez","On Thursday — the National Day of Prayer — President Donald Trump made a move intended to satisfy his repeated promises to conservative Christians from the campaign trail . Flanked by members of the clergy in the Rose Garden , Trump signed the highly anticipated Executive Order on Promoting Free Speech and Religious Liberty .
The order proclaims that the executive branch will “ vigorously enforce Federal law 's robust protections for religious freedom ” and proposes strengthening of protections for companies and organizations that claim a conscience-based exemption to paying for contraceptive care .
But its longest and most substantial portion deals with the political speech of religious leaders and organizations . Here is the key sentence :
In particular , the Secretary of the Treasury shall ensure , to the extent permitted by law , that the Department of the Treasury does not take any adverse action against any individual , house of worship , or other religious organization on the basis that such individual or organization speaks or has spoken about moral or political issues from a religious perspective , where speech of similar character has , consistent with law , not ordinarily been treated as participation or intervention in a political campaign on behalf of ( or in opposition to ) a candidate for public office by the Department of the Treasury .
Currently , organizations registered with the IRS as tax-exempt under the 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) designation aren ’ t permitted to participate in political campaign activity , which includes endorsing or opposing candidates from the pulpit and contributing money to campaigns . Trump 's executive order says they can speak publicly on `` moral or political issues from a religious perspective '' without risking their tax exempt status — which in reality is not a substantial change from the status quo .
That ’ s because the order stipulates that it pertains only to activity of “ similar character ” to speech that isn ’ t already restricted . ( Some speculate that this could be intended to compare speech from religious organizations to similar speech from secular organizations , but the wording of the order leaves this vague . ) The IRS has issued guidelines for tax-exempt organizations on what falls under the “ political campaign activity ” category . So , this order doesn ’ t allow restrictions on political speech from religious people and organizations to be expanded . But it doesn ’ t explicitly contract them , either .
The order overall is far weaker than many religious conservatives had been hoping it would be . It ’ s also a far cry from both a draft of the order leaked in February , which included strong protections for people and organizations claiming religious objections to same-sex marriage , premarital sex , abortion , and trans identity .
And though the language around matters relating to the Johnson Amendment remains consistent between the draft and final order , both abandon Trump ’ s campaign promise to “ totally destroy ” the Johnson Amendment , which remains on the books . The order simply instructs IRS officials to respect the freedom of individuals and organizations to participate in religiously-grounded political speech to the “ greatest extent practicable and to the extent permitted by law . ”
The order is so weak , in fact , that the ACLU issued a statement calling Trump ’ s campaign promise “ fake news ” and the executive order an “ elaborate photo op with no discernible policy outcome. ” The statement said that at least for now , the organization won ’ t be filing an lawsuit .
The executive order does not fulfill one of Trump ’ s major promises — to “ totally destroy ” the Johnson Amendment
This section of the executive order was widely expected to loosen restrictions imposed on religious organizations by the 1954 Johnson Amendment , which prohibits all 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) organizations ( including many types of nonprofits that are not religious in nature ) from “ directly or indirectly participating in , or intervening in , any political campaign on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for elective public office . ”
In the briefest terms , the Johnson Amendment keeps religious and many other tax-exempt organizations from endorsing or oppose specific candidates for public office , as well as contributing to campaigns . Those that do risk losing their tax-exempt status .
Trump has repeatedly promised to abolish the Johnson Amendment , both before and after his election . But the executive order isn ’ t close to abolishment . Because the Johnson Amendment is part of the tax code , only Congress could repeal it , or it could be struck down in court .
Instead , the executive order instructs the Treasury Department ( of which the IRS is a bureau ) to not penalize individuals , congregations , or other organizations for “ speech ” on moral or political issues “ from a religious perspective ” — while maintaining the caveat that the speech must not participate or intervene in a candidate ’ s political campaign . The executive order makes no mention of financial contributions to political campaigns .
A draft executive order leaked in February contained virtually identical language around political speech by religious groups . Writing for Bloomberg BNA on that draft , Joseph J. Ecuyer also pointed out the vague language and seeming weakness of the instruction to the IRS . “ Perhaps this is just putting the IRS on notice to not enforce the prohibition against intervention in political campaigns , ” he wrote . “ Right now , it ’ s unclear . ”
The summary document distributed to religious leaders at the White House on Wednesday night suggested that the executive order would alleviate the burden of the Johnson Amendment , which “ prohibits religious leaders from speaking about politics and candidates from the pulpit ” — a statement which partly mischaracterizes the Amendment . But the actual text of the executive order makes no statement about candidate endorsement .
At most , the executive order gives IRS officials explicit permission to do what they already do : rarely enforce the Johnson Amendment .
The IRS ’ s own guidelines explicitly allow statements on political or moral issues , while prohibiting direct campaigning on behalf of political candidates
The IRS issued guidelines in 2006 regarding what it considers to constitute political campaign intervention .
Activities like endorsing candidates , contributing to campaign funds , making public statements of position in reference to campaigns , and providing use of an organization ’ s assets and facilities to one candidate without the opportunity being offered to all candidates are restricted activities for 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) organizations .
Under Trump ’ s executive order , these activities are all still technically prohibited , since they have “ ordinarily been treated as participation or intervention in a political campaign. ” However , IRS officials could choose to not enforce those rules , as many have done in the past .
The executive order also only explicitly protects statements on moral or political issues , which the IRS calls “ issue advocacy ” and considers to be beyond the Johnson Amendment ’ s purview .
In its 2006 guidelines , the IRS distinguishes “ issue advocacy ” from political campaign intervention , outlining a set of circumstances that it takes into account when evaluating whether a 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) organization has overstepped its boundaries . A church should not be stripped of its 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) status , for instance , if it consistently advocates for the rights of immigrants or against abortion .
But a church would risk action if it invited a specific candidate to speak at its services without inviting the other candidates , or if the pastor specifically endorsed a candidate during a sermon . And a pastor who ’ s never preached on immigration reform but suddenly starts pointedly doing so weeks before an election could theoretically run the risk of losing the church ’ s tax-exempt status as well .
Opponents of the Johnson Amendment argue that the amendment may be unconstitutional and that this threat , though rarely enforced , has a “ chilling effect ” on what clergy feel comfortable saying from the pulpit . However , the right to simply speak up on moral and political issues isn ’ t denied by the Johnson Amendment or the IRS ’ s interpretation of it .
And this matches common sense : Religious organizations speak up on moral issues as a matter of course . In fact , a Pew survey found last August that nearly two-thirds of recent churchgoers had heard clergy speak out about at least one social or political issue . Many of these moral issues overlap with political issues , and churches may even participate in lobbying activity , as long as it constitutes a “ insubstantial ” part of their activity . It ’ s part of being a religious organization .

The Johnson Amendment repeal has consistently been one of Trump ’ s major promises to religious voters
At the signing of the executive order , President Trump ’ s statements echoed rhetoric that had been common during his campaign , saying that “ for too long the federal government has used the state as a weapon against people of faith , ” and that `` we are giving our churches their voices back . '' Trump said that no one should be “ censoring sermons or targeting pastors , ” and that now , with the provision of the executive order , religious leaders were in a position to “ say what they wanted to say . ”
`` We will not allow people of faith to be targeted , bullied or silenced anymore , ” the president said .
The White House tweeted similar sentiments , saying that religious people were attacked for following the tenets of their faith during the Obama administration :
During the last 8 years , Americans have been under attack from the federal government for following the tenets of their faiths . pic.twitter.com/1RWEWvmgyT — The White House ( @ WhiteHouse ) May 4 , 2017
This is consistent with the way the Trump campaign and administration has characterized the Johnson Amendment : as a broad silencer of and odious restriction on thousands of clergy and religious people . At his first National Prayer Breakfast on February 2 , President Trump reiterated his campaign promise to repeal the Johnson Amendment :
Our republic was formed on the basis that freedom is not a gift from government , but that freedom is a gift from God . It was the great Thomas Jefferson who said the God who gave us life gave us liberty . Jefferson asked , “ Can the liberties of a nation be secure when we have removed a conviction that these liberties are the gift of God ? ” Among those freedoms is the right to worship according to our own beliefs . That is why I will get rid of and totally destroy the Johnson Amendment and allow our representatives of faith to speak freely and without fear of retribution . I will do that . Remember .
The promise to “ totally destroy ” the amendment seems to have been introduced on June 22 , 2016 , when as a candidate Trump met with hundreds of evangelical leaders in a closed-door meeting in New York City . During that meeting , Trump made two promises to woo evangelicals : installing conservative justices in the Supreme Court and abolishing the Johnson Amendment , because religious leaders “ have the right to speak . ”
Trump incorrectly stated during the meeting that Johnson passed the amendment while president . The amendment was passed by Congress in 1954 , and Johnson , of course , didn ’ t serve as president until 1963 . In 1954 , Johnson was a senator , and he proposed this change to the tax code in part to keep certain tax-exempt organizations from endorsing or opposing candidates and boost his re-election chances .
This issue resurfaced in Trump ’ s acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention on July 21 , in which he represented it as “ an amendment , pushed by Lyndon Johnson many years ago , [ that ] threatens religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate their political views . '' ( We fact-checked his speech here . )
Then in a five-minute video that played in a number of evangelical churches on November 6 , Mike Pence made a pitch to congregants for their vote , citing conservative Supreme Court appointments and a promise to repeal the Johnson Amendment .
The Johnson Amendment has literally been on the books since the 1950s and it essentially threatens tax-exempt organizations and churches with losing their tax status if they speak out against important issues facing the nation from the pulpit .
Pence goes on to enumerate three moments in American history in which pulpits stood against tyranny : against King George III ’ s oppressive rule prior to the American Revolution , against the practice of slavery , and in favor of civil rights .
It ’ s worth noting that there are plenty of examples of pulpits standing for said tyrannies as well , a matter Pence does not address . It ’ s also worth pointing out that the Johnson Amendment was passed during the early days of the civil rights movement , which complicates Pence ’ s third example as a reason to get rid of it .
Pence ’ s video has been removed from Vimeo but can be viewed on YouTube , and as of this writing it has been watched over 234,000 times .
Nearly a million and a half organizations in the US are registered as tax-exempt , many of which are 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) . As of last year , 312,373 of those organizations are religious congregations . As the IRS interprets the Johnson Amendment , tax-exempt organizations — those that fall under the 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) designation — include those which are “ religious , educational , charitable , scientific , literary , testing for public safety , to foster national or international sports competition , or prevention of cruelty to children or animals organizations. ” These activities are permitted for charities :
The term charitable is used in its generally accepted legal sense and includes relief of the poor , the distressed , or the underprivileged ; advancement of religion ; advancement of education or science ; erecting or maintaining public buildings , monuments , or works ; lessening the burdens of government ; lessening neighborhood tensions ; eliminating prejudice and discrimination ; defending human and civil rights secured by law ; and combating community deterioration and juvenile delinquency .
Incidentally , both the Donald J. Trump Foundation and the Clinton Foundation are 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) organizations .
But the Johnson Amendment has become a particular target of the conservative Alliance Defending Freedom , which argues it is unconstitutional and has a chilling effect on houses of worship and religious organizations . A blog post on the organization ’ s website from October 31 , 2016 , mirrors Pence ’ s statement :
Historically , churches frequently spoke for and against candidates for government office . Such sermons date from the founding of the United States , including those against Thomas Jefferson for being a deist and sermons opposing William Howard Taft as a Unitarian . Churches have also been at the forefront of most of the significant societal and governmental changes in our history , including ending segregation and child labor , and advancing civil rights .
The ADF argues that the amendment unconstitutionally restricts the First Amendment rights of pastors and churches as well as the free exercise clause in the Constitution , which states that Congress can not make laws that keep people from freely exercising their religion . ( That argument that is disputed by others . )
After the 1954 Johnson Amendment , churches faced a choice : speak freely on all issues addressed by Scripture and potentially risk their tax exemption , or remain silent and protect their tax-exempt status . Unfortunately , many churches have silenced their speech , even from the pulpit . Ironically , after 60-plus years of the IRS strictly interpreting the amendment , there is no reported situation where a church lost its tax-exempt status or was punished for sermons delivered from the pulpit . Nonetheless , the law remains unchanged and many churches remain silent due to the IRS ’ s interpretation of the amendment .
That is , according to the ADF , the Johnson Amendment has never actually been used to strip a congregation of its 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) status because of sermons delivered from the pulpit . The ADF ’ s “ Pulpit Freedom Movement ” is an attempt to protest the amendment by having pastors preach specifically political sermons .
Yet last year ’ s Pew study found that about two-thirds of regular churchgoers had heard political statements from the pulpit . The highest percentage of these were black Protestants , 28 percent of whom heard clergy support for Hillary Clinton and about 20 percent of whom heard ministers oppose Donald Trump . By contrast , about 4 percent of white evangelicals heard clergy support a presidential candidate , while 7 percent heard statements against a candidate .
In a rare case , the Johnson Amendment was used in 1995 to strip an upstate New York church of its tax-exempt status after the church placed a full-page ads opposing Bill Clinton in two newspapers during the 1992 election — a penalty that was upheld in federal court .
In 2014 , Houston Mayor Annise Parker subpoenaed five sermons from churches in her city . After widespread outcry , Parker dropped the subpoena , saying that it had been overly broad . Interestingly , this event is referenced in the successful 2016 Christian film God ’ s Not Dead 2 — in which a pastor character is hauled off to jail for refusing to turn his sermons over to the authorities for approval , rather than merely having his church ’ s tax-exempt status revoked — and teased as the probable plot for the inevitable God ’ s Not Dead 3 .
Yet the case in Houston rattled congregations across the country , and clergy are understandably reticent to submit their sermons for approval every week . It ’ s easy to reason that this narrative is in the background of Trump ’ s apparent interest in the law too .
The argument to repeal the amendment rests on the idea that churches and other religious congregations are restricting their speech for fear of something that is inconsistently enforced , at best . While this is absolutely plausible , the extent to which it happens is understandably hard to substantiate or quantify . On Thursday , some Christian conservatives took to Twitter to suggest it ’ s at best a red herring :
In years of conversations w/religious leaders worried about their institutions ' liberties , Johnson amendment has literally never come up . — Ross Douthat ( @ DouthatNYT ) May 4 , 2017
It 's a shiny object meant to distract from the fight over there . https : //t.co/z1GtyxlyTa — Eric Teetsel ( @ EricTeetsel ) May 4 , 2017
There are a few other misleading matters in arguments such as Trump ’ s and Pence ’ s , which frequently rest on statements about the Revolution , slavery , and civil rights . As it ’ s interpreted by the IRS , the Johnson Amendment would never have kept clergy from preaching consistently that slavery is a violation of God ’ s law . It would have just kept clergy from endorsing Abraham Lincoln from the pulpit or on behalf of their congregations , though they ’ d be free to speak out on his behalf as private citizens . And , again , using the civil rights as an example is strange , since the amendment was in place during the period when many influential church sermons on civil rights were delivered .
( The churches that could potentially risk their exemption are those which don ’ t consistently preach against these matters , except in close proximity to an election . )
The fact that some churches did show the Pence ad is an indicator of the state of the enforcement of the Johnson Amendment . Under the IRS ’ s interpretation , 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) organizations are allowed to provide a forum for candidates , which “ is not , in and of itself , prohibited political activity , ” so this may technically fall under that provision . ( This is only permitted if those churches also offered a similar slot to the Clinton campaign . )
The ongoing Johnson Amendment debate has implications that stretch far beyond churches
There are several interesting implications of this ongoing debate about abolishing the amendment .
First , it articulates what the Trump ’ s administration thinks is important to the evangelical voter . The campaign correctly identified that issues around abortion and religious liberty , and their status on the Supreme Court , were a driving force behind many voters ’ choices . Indeed , the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch as a Supreme Court justice was a huge win for conservative voters who gambled on Trump .
But while nearly 80 percent of Americans say they do not favor political endorsements in church , there remains a persistent belief among many Trump supporters , including his chief strategist Steve Bannon , that the influence of Christians on American culture is in decline , and that this must be counteracted . It seems Trump ’ s administration is attempting to propose concrete action on this , in at least one way , by suggesting that the Johnson Amendment is to blame for churches ’ declining influence . At the meeting of evangelical leaders in June 2016 , Trump spoke further :
And I say to you folks , because you have such power , such influence . Unfortunately the government has weeded it away from you pretty strongly . But you ’ re going to get it back . Remember this : If you ever add up , the men and women here are the most important , powerful lobbyists . You ’ re more powerful . Because you have men and women , you probably have something like 75 , 80 percent of the country believing . But you don ’ t use your power . You don ’ t use your power… You used to go to church , and you know , when I ’ d go there . … It ’ s much different today . I know , as an example , the young people aren ’ t going as much . But we have to bring that back . We have to bring those values back . We have to bring that spirit back . And in a way , it ’ s been taken away from you by the federal government and by these horrendous things that have been allowed in the past . But just remember this : You are the most powerful group in this country . But you have to realize that . You have to band together . You have to band together . If you don ’ t band together , you ’ re really not powerful . You have a powerful church . I see it . I see some of these incredible pastors and ministers and people that speak so brilliantly . And I see it . But they ’ re great within their audience , but then outside they don ’ t have it . You have to band together as a group . And if you do that , you will bring it back like nothing has ever been brought back .
Power , as the Trump campaign sees it , is the greatest good — and it ’ s what has been stolen from churches . The way to please churches is to bring power back .
Because most 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) organizations are not religious congregations , any complete abolishment of the Johnson Amendment would also lift restrictions on other nonprofit organizations with 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) designations that wish to endorse a candidate . Universities and colleges , sports organizations , entities that promote scientific or literary causes , and charitable foundations would be free to conduct activities that support a political campaign and endorse candidates .
Trump ’ s murky executive order is far from a Johnson Amendment abolishment , though — and its critics on the right and left see it mostly as the administration waving shiny objects to pacify some religious conservatives , especially the white evangelicals who form Trump ’ s enthusiastic base .
Yet the debate has hardly ended . The implications for both religious groups and political campaign speech and funding are substantial , and for now , still uncertain .","On Thursday — the National Day of Prayer — President Donald Trump made a move intended to satisfy his repeated promises to conservative Christians from the campaign trail. Flanked by members of the clergy in the Rose Garden, Trump signed the highly anticipated Executive Order on Promoting Free Speech and Religious Liberty.

The order proclaims that the executive branch will “vigorously enforce Federal law's robust protections for religious freedom” and proposes strengthening of protections for companies and organizations that claim a conscience-based exemption to paying for contraceptive care.

But its longest and most substantial portion deals with the political speech of religious leaders and organizations. Here is the key sentence:

In particular, the Secretary of the Treasury shall ensure, to the extent permitted by law, that the Department of the Treasury does not take any adverse action against any individual, house of worship, or other religious organization on the basis that such individual or organization speaks or has spoken about moral or political issues from a religious perspective, where speech of similar character has, consistent with law, not ordinarily been treated as participation or intervention in a political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) a candidate for public office by the Department of the Treasury.

Currently, organizations registered with the IRS as tax-exempt under the 501(c)(3) designation aren’t permitted to participate in political campaign activity, which includes endorsing or opposing candidates from the pulpit and contributing money to campaigns. Trump's executive order says they can speak publicly on ""moral or political issues from a religious perspective"" without risking their tax exempt status — which in reality is not a substantial change from the status quo.

That’s because the order stipulates that it pertains only to activity of “similar character” to speech that isn’t already restricted. (Some speculate that this could be intended to compare speech from religious organizations to similar speech from secular organizations, but the wording of the order leaves this vague.) The IRS has issued guidelines for tax-exempt organizations on what falls under the “political campaign activity” category. So, this order doesn’t allow restrictions on political speech from religious people and organizations to be expanded. But it doesn’t explicitly contract them, either.

The order overall is far weaker than many religious conservatives had been hoping it would be. It’s also a far cry from both a draft of the order leaked in February, which included strong protections for people and organizations claiming religious objections to same-sex marriage, premarital sex, abortion, and trans identity.

And though the language around matters relating to the Johnson Amendment remains consistent between the draft and final order, both abandon Trump’s campaign promise to “totally destroy” the Johnson Amendment, which remains on the books. The order simply instructs IRS officials to respect the freedom of individuals and organizations to participate in religiously-grounded political speech to the “greatest extent practicable and to the extent permitted by law.”

The order is so weak, in fact, that the ACLU issued a statement calling Trump’s campaign promise “fake news” and the executive order an “elaborate photo op with no discernible policy outcome.” The statement said that at least for now, the organization won’t be filing an lawsuit.

The executive order does not fulfill one of Trump’s major promises — to “totally destroy” the Johnson Amendment

This section of the executive order was widely expected to loosen restrictions imposed on religious organizations by the 1954 Johnson Amendment, which prohibits all 501(c)(3) organizations (including many types of nonprofits that are not religious in nature) from “directly or indirectly participating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for elective public office.”

In the briefest terms, the Johnson Amendment keeps religious and many other tax-exempt organizations from endorsing or oppose specific candidates for public office, as well as contributing to campaigns. Those that do risk losing their tax-exempt status.

Trump has repeatedly promised to abolish the Johnson Amendment, both before and after his election. But the executive order isn’t close to abolishment. Because the Johnson Amendment is part of the tax code, only Congress could repeal it, or it could be struck down in court.

Instead, the executive order instructs the Treasury Department (of which the IRS is a bureau) to not penalize individuals, congregations, or other organizations for “speech” on moral or political issues “from a religious perspective” — while maintaining the caveat that the speech must not participate or intervene in a candidate’s political campaign. The executive order makes no mention of financial contributions to political campaigns.

A draft executive order leaked in February contained virtually identical language around political speech by religious groups. Writing for Bloomberg BNA on that draft, Joseph J. Ecuyer also pointed out the vague language and seeming weakness of the instruction to the IRS. “Perhaps this is just putting the IRS on notice to not enforce the prohibition against intervention in political campaigns,” he wrote. “Right now, it’s unclear.”

The summary document distributed to religious leaders at the White House on Wednesday night suggested that the executive order would alleviate the burden of the Johnson Amendment, which “prohibits religious leaders from speaking about politics and candidates from the pulpit” — a statement which partly mischaracterizes the Amendment. But the actual text of the executive order makes no statement about candidate endorsement.

At most, the executive order gives IRS officials explicit permission to do what they already do: rarely enforce the Johnson Amendment.

The IRS’s own guidelines explicitly allow statements on political or moral issues, while prohibiting direct campaigning on behalf of political candidates

The IRS issued guidelines in 2006 regarding what it considers to constitute political campaign intervention.

Activities like endorsing candidates, contributing to campaign funds, making public statements of position in reference to campaigns, and providing use of an organization’s assets and facilities to one candidate without the opportunity being offered to all candidates are restricted activities for 501(c)(3) organizations.

Under Trump’s executive order, these activities are all still technically prohibited, since they have “ordinarily been treated as participation or intervention in a political campaign.” However, IRS officials could choose to not enforce those rules, as many have done in the past.

The executive order also only explicitly protects statements on moral or political issues, which the IRS calls “issue advocacy” and considers to be beyond the Johnson Amendment’s purview.

In its 2006 guidelines, the IRS distinguishes “issue advocacy” from political campaign intervention, outlining a set of circumstances that it takes into account when evaluating whether a 501(c)(3) organization has overstepped its boundaries. A church should not be stripped of its 501(c)(3) status, for instance, if it consistently advocates for the rights of immigrants or against abortion.

But a church would risk action if it invited a specific candidate to speak at its services without inviting the other candidates, or if the pastor specifically endorsed a candidate during a sermon. And a pastor who’s never preached on immigration reform but suddenly starts pointedly doing so weeks before an election could theoretically run the risk of losing the church’s tax-exempt status as well.

Opponents of the Johnson Amendment argue that the amendment may be unconstitutional and that this threat, though rarely enforced, has a “chilling effect” on what clergy feel comfortable saying from the pulpit. However, the right to simply speak up on moral and political issues isn’t denied by the Johnson Amendment or the IRS’s interpretation of it.

And this matches common sense: Religious organizations speak up on moral issues as a matter of course. In fact, a Pew survey found last August that nearly two-thirds of recent churchgoers had heard clergy speak out about at least one social or political issue. Many of these moral issues overlap with political issues, and churches may even participate in lobbying activity, as long as it constitutes a “insubstantial” part of their activity. It’s part of being a religious organization.

The executive order also mentions protecting individuals who speak on political matters from a religious viewpoint. The IRS is clear about individuals’ First Amendment rights (even religious leaders), stating that leaders of organizations can speak for themselves on political matters and issues of public policy as individuals. They are only restricted from making “partisan comments in official organization publications or at official functions of the organization.” A minister can publicly express support for a candidate (and many have), as long as she makes it clear that it is her statement is as an individual, and not on behalf of her church, in a church publication, or at a church function.

The executive order only explicitly protects speech that is technically already protected, and specifically stipulates that any speech that might be ordinarily considered political campaign intervention still ought to be treated as such. It may strengthen protection in the gray areas of issue advocacy, if individual IRS officials choose to interpret it that way. And it doesn’t expand or contract protections. It merely makes explicit what’s on the books, while also giving outright clearance to the IRS to exercise lenience.

The executive order doesn’t satisfy liberals or conservatives

Many conservatives, centrists, and liberals are not pleased with the executive order. Some conservative opposition comes because the order doesn’t offer strong support for individuals and organizations claiming religious exemptions from matters relating to same-sex marriage, premarital sex, abortion, and trans identity, as the draft order would have. The specific provisions are cut down to allowing organizations to opt out of the mandate to provide contraceptives through employer insurance.

But the entire executive order came under fire across the political spectrum, with criticism for its treatment of the Johnson Amendment as well.

After a summary of the order was released on Wednesday night, the conservative Alliance Defending Freedom — a key opponent of the Johnson Amendment — issued a statement that sharply criticized the executive order, with senior counsel Gregory S. Baylor saying that it “recalls those campaign promises but leaves them unfulfilled.”

The ADF was involved in drafting last fall’s H.R. 781, a.k.a. the Free Speech Fairness Act, an amendment to the tax code which would allow pastors to endorse candidates and make political statements in the “ordinary course of the organization’s regular and customary activities.” The bill, which was introduced to the House by Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) and was referred to committe, would not have permitted participation in campaigns or contributions to political activities and candidates. (A companion bill, S.264, was introduced in the Senate.) The ADF also organizes the annual Pulpit Freedom Sunday, a protest movement against the Johnson Amendment.

Conservative columnist David French strongly criticized the executive order in National Review, and its editorial board called it “a vague and unworkable mishmash of executive direction that has the potential to make the problem worse.”

A number of prominent religious conservatives took to Twitter to criticize the order as well:

The religious liberty executive order is meaningless. No substantive protections for conscience. A betrayal. Ivanka and Jared won. We lost. https://t.co/Xn94KWTKPX — Robert P. George (@McCormickProf) May 4, 2017

Following the order’s signing, the centrist Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty executive director Amanda Tyler released a statement accusing the order of being “largely a symbolic act, voicing concern for religious liberty but offering nothing to advance it. Worse, it is further evidence that President Trump wants churches to be vehicles for political campaigns.”

Nearly 80 percent of Americans say they do not favor political endorsements in church. And in April, 99 Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, and other religious groups sent a letter opposing any move to abolish the amendment to congressional leadership.

Yet Trump’s opposition to the amendment was often greeted with applause and support in meetings with religious leaders, where he said it unnecessarily restricted their ability to speak freely. However, the reality of the Johnson Amendment — and any move to get rid of it or reduce it — is more complicated than statements around it might suggest.

The Johnson Amendment repeal has consistently been one of Trump’s major promises to religious voters

At the signing of the executive order, President Trump’s statements echoed rhetoric that had been common during his campaign, saying that “for too long the federal government has used the state as a weapon against people of faith,” and that ""we are giving our churches their voices back."" Trump said that no one should be “censoring sermons or targeting pastors,” and that now, with the provision of the executive order, religious leaders were in a position to “say what they wanted to say.”

""We will not allow people of faith to be targeted, bullied or silenced anymore,” the president said.

The White House tweeted similar sentiments, saying that religious people were attacked for following the tenets of their faith during the Obama administration:

During the last 8 years, Americans have been under attack from the federal government for following the tenets of their faiths. pic.twitter.com/1RWEWvmgyT — The White House (@WhiteHouse) May 4, 2017

This is consistent with the way the Trump campaign and administration has characterized the Johnson Amendment: as a broad silencer of and odious restriction on thousands of clergy and religious people. At his first National Prayer Breakfast on February 2, President Trump reiterated his campaign promise to repeal the Johnson Amendment:

Our republic was formed on the basis that freedom is not a gift from government, but that freedom is a gift from God. It was the great Thomas Jefferson who said the God who gave us life gave us liberty. Jefferson asked, “Can the liberties of a nation be secure when we have removed a conviction that these liberties are the gift of God?” Among those freedoms is the right to worship according to our own beliefs. That is why I will get rid of and totally destroy the Johnson Amendment and allow our representatives of faith to speak freely and without fear of retribution. I will do that. Remember.

The promise to “totally destroy” the amendment seems to have been introduced on June 22, 2016, when as a candidate Trump met with hundreds of evangelical leaders in a closed-door meeting in New York City. During that meeting, Trump made two promises to woo evangelicals: installing conservative justices in the Supreme Court and abolishing the Johnson Amendment, because religious leaders “have the right to speak.”

Trump incorrectly stated during the meeting that Johnson passed the amendment while president. The amendment was passed by Congress in 1954, and Johnson, of course, didn’t serve as president until 1963. In 1954, Johnson was a senator, and he proposed this change to the tax code in part to keep certain tax-exempt organizations from endorsing or opposing candidates and boost his re-election chances.

This issue resurfaced in Trump’s acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention on July 21, in which he represented it as “an amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson many years ago, [that] threatens religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate their political views."" (We fact-checked his speech here.)

Then in a five-minute video that played in a number of evangelical churches on November 6, Mike Pence made a pitch to congregants for their vote, citing conservative Supreme Court appointments and a promise to repeal the Johnson Amendment.

Here is how Pence describes it in the video:

The Johnson Amendment has literally been on the books since the 1950s and it essentially threatens tax-exempt organizations and churches with losing their tax status if they speak out against important issues facing the nation from the pulpit.

Pence goes on to enumerate three moments in American history in which pulpits stood against tyranny: against King George III’s oppressive rule prior to the American Revolution, against the practice of slavery, and in favor of civil rights.

It’s worth noting that there are plenty of examples of pulpits standing for said tyrannies as well, a matter Pence does not address. It’s also worth pointing out that the Johnson Amendment was passed during the early days of the civil rights movement, which complicates Pence’s third example as a reason to get rid of it.

Pence’s video has been removed from Vimeo but can be viewed on YouTube, and as of this writing it has been watched over 234,000 times.

The Johnson Amendment doesn’t only target churches

Nearly a million and a half organizations in the US are registered as tax-exempt, many of which are 501(c)(3). As of last year, 312,373 of those organizations are religious congregations. As the IRS interprets the Johnson Amendment, tax-exempt organizations — those that fall under the 501(c)(3) designation — include those which are “religious, educational, charitable, scientific, literary, testing for public safety, to foster national or international sports competition, or prevention of cruelty to children or animals organizations.” These activities are permitted for charities:

The term charitable is used in its generally accepted legal sense and includes relief of the poor, the distressed, or the underprivileged; advancement of religion; advancement of education or science; erecting or maintaining public buildings, monuments, or works; lessening the burdens of government; lessening neighborhood tensions; eliminating prejudice and discrimination; defending human and civil rights secured by law; and combating community deterioration and juvenile delinquency.

Incidentally, both the Donald J. Trump Foundation and the Clinton Foundation are 501(c)(3) organizations.

But the Johnson Amendment has become a particular target of the conservative Alliance Defending Freedom, which argues it is unconstitutional and has a chilling effect on houses of worship and religious organizations. A blog post on the organization’s website from October 31, 2016, mirrors Pence’s statement:

Historically, churches frequently spoke for and against candidates for government office. Such sermons date from the founding of the United States, including those against Thomas Jefferson for being a deist and sermons opposing William Howard Taft as a Unitarian. Churches have also been at the forefront of most of the significant societal and governmental changes in our history, including ending segregation and child labor, and advancing civil rights.

The ADF argues that the amendment unconstitutionally restricts the First Amendment rights of pastors and churches as well as the free exercise clause in the Constitution, which states that Congress cannot make laws that keep people from freely exercising their religion. (That argument that is disputed by others.)

The ADF’s blog post concludes on a surprising note:

After the 1954 Johnson Amendment, churches faced a choice: speak freely on all issues addressed by Scripture and potentially risk their tax exemption, or remain silent and protect their tax-exempt status. Unfortunately, many churches have silenced their speech, even from the pulpit. Ironically, after 60-plus years of the IRS strictly interpreting the amendment, there is no reported situation where a church lost its tax-exempt status or was punished for sermons delivered from the pulpit. Nonetheless, the law remains unchanged and many churches remain silent due to the IRS’s interpretation of the amendment.

That is, according to the ADF, the Johnson Amendment has never actually been used to strip a congregation of its 501(c)(3) status because of sermons delivered from the pulpit. The ADF’s “Pulpit Freedom Movement” is an attempt to protest the amendment by having pastors preach specifically political sermons.

Yet last year’s Pew study found that about two-thirds of regular churchgoers had heard political statements from the pulpit. The highest percentage of these were black Protestants, 28 percent of whom heard clergy support for Hillary Clinton and about 20 percent of whom heard ministers oppose Donald Trump. By contrast, about 4 percent of white evangelicals heard clergy support a presidential candidate, while 7 percent heard statements against a candidate.

In a rare case, the Johnson Amendment was used in 1995 to strip an upstate New York church of its tax-exempt status after the church placed a full-page ads opposing Bill Clinton in two newspapers during the 1992 election — a penalty that was upheld in federal court.

In 2014, Houston Mayor Annise Parker subpoenaed five sermons from churches in her city. After widespread outcry, Parker dropped the subpoena, saying that it had been overly broad. Interestingly, this event is referenced in the successful 2016 Christian film God’s Not Dead 2 — in which a pastor character is hauled off to jail for refusing to turn his sermons over to the authorities for approval, rather than merely having his church’s tax-exempt status revoked — and teased as the probable plot for the inevitable God’s Not Dead 3.

Yet the case in Houston rattled congregations across the country, and clergy are understandably reticent to submit their sermons for approval every week. It’s easy to reason that this narrative is in the background of Trump’s apparent interest in the law too.

The argument to repeal the amendment rests on the idea that churches and other religious congregations are restricting their speech for fear of something that is inconsistently enforced, at best. While this is absolutely plausible, the extent to which it happens is understandably hard to substantiate or quantify. On Thursday, some Christian conservatives took to Twitter to suggest it’s at best a red herring:

In years of conversations w/religious leaders worried about their institutions' liberties, Johnson amendment has literally never come up. — Ross Douthat (@DouthatNYT) May 4, 2017

It's a shiny object meant to distract from the fight over there. https://t.co/z1GtyxlyTa — Eric Teetsel (@EricTeetsel) May 4, 2017

There are a few other misleading matters in arguments such as Trump’s and Pence’s, which frequently rest on statements about the Revolution, slavery, and civil rights. As it’s interpreted by the IRS, the Johnson Amendment would never have kept clergy from preaching consistently that slavery is a violation of God’s law. It would have just kept clergy from endorsing Abraham Lincoln from the pulpit or on behalf of their congregations, though they’d be free to speak out on his behalf as private citizens. And, again, using the civil rights as an example is strange, since the amendment was in place during the period when many influential church sermons on civil rights were delivered.

(The churches that could potentially risk their exemption are those which don’t consistently preach against these matters, except in close proximity to an election.)

The fact that some churches did show the Pence ad is an indicator of the state of the enforcement of the Johnson Amendment. Under the IRS’s interpretation, 501(c)(3) organizations are allowed to provide a forum for candidates, which “is not, in and of itself, prohibited political activity,” so this may technically fall under that provision. (This is only permitted if those churches also offered a similar slot to the Clinton campaign.)

The ongoing Johnson Amendment debate has implications that stretch far beyond churches

There are several interesting implications of this ongoing debate about abolishing the amendment.

First, it articulates what the Trump’s administration thinks is important to the evangelical voter. The campaign correctly identified that issues around abortion and religious liberty, and their status on the Supreme Court, were a driving force behind many voters’ choices. Indeed, the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch as a Supreme Court justice was a huge win for conservative voters who gambled on Trump.

But while nearly 80 percent of Americans say they do not favor political endorsements in church, there remains a persistent belief among many Trump supporters, including his chief strategist Steve Bannon, that the influence of Christians on American culture is in decline, and that this must be counteracted. It seems Trump’s administration is attempting to propose concrete action on this, in at least one way, by suggesting that the Johnson Amendment is to blame for churches’ declining influence. At the meeting of evangelical leaders in June 2016, Trump spoke further:

And I say to you folks, because you have such power, such influence. Unfortunately the government has weeded it away from you pretty strongly. But you’re going to get it back. Remember this: If you ever add up, the men and women here are the most important, powerful lobbyists. You’re more powerful. Because you have men and women, you probably have something like 75, 80 percent of the country believing. But you don’t use your power. You don’t use your power… You used to go to church, and you know, when I’d go there. … It’s much different today. I know, as an example, the young people aren’t going as much. But we have to bring that back. We have to bring those values back. We have to bring that spirit back. And in a way, it’s been taken away from you by the federal government and by these horrendous things that have been allowed in the past. But just remember this: You are the most powerful group in this country. But you have to realize that. You have to band together. You have to band together. If you don’t band together, you’re really not powerful. You have a powerful church. I see it. I see some of these incredible pastors and ministers and people that speak so brilliantly. And I see it. But they’re great within their audience, but then outside they don’t have it. You have to band together as a group. And if you do that, you will bring it back like nothing has ever been brought back.

Power, as the Trump campaign sees it, is the greatest good — and it’s what has been stolen from churches. The way to please churches is to bring power back.

Because most 501(c)(3) organizations are not religious congregations, any complete abolishment of the Johnson Amendment would also lift restrictions on other nonprofit organizations with 501(c)(3) designations that wish to endorse a candidate. Universities and colleges, sports organizations, entities that promote scientific or literary causes, and charitable foundations would be free to conduct activities that support a political campaign and endorse candidates.

Trump’s murky executive order is far from a Johnson Amendment abolishment, though — and its critics on the right and left see it mostly as the administration waving shiny objects to pacify some religious conservatives, especially the white evangelicals who form Trump’s enthusiastic base.

Yet the debate has hardly ended. The implications for both religious groups and political campaign speech and funding are substantial, and for now, still uncertain.",www.vox.com,left,iPZTYLPvfKiIhypX

They prayed in the dugout on the practice field.

They prayed before the congressional baseball game at Nationals Park.

They prayed at the hospital. They prayed at the Capitol.

They prayed in churches. They prayed in synagogues. They prayed in mosques.

Congressional leaders prayed. Foreign leaders prayed. The president of the United States prayed.

They prayed when he went into surgery. They prayed when he came out. They prayed when doctors tilted his condition back to critical a few weeks later due to an infection.

A gunman shot House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., at the Republican baseball practice June 14 at Eugene Simpson Stadium Park in Alexandria, Va. Shrapnel pulverized Scalise’s pelvis, sliced through organs and tissue and shattered his femur.

Bullets sprayed U.S. Capitol Police Special Agents Crystal Griner and David Bailey, congressional aide Zack Barth and lobbyist Matt Mika.

To escape the fusillade, Scalise dragged himself on his stomach across the infield dirt from second base to short right field. And then from the grass, Scalise gasped the first invocation about the evil that pierced that morning’s baseball practice.

“When I was laying on that ball field, the first thing I did once I was down and I couldn’t move any more is I started to pray,” said Scalise addressing the House upon his return to Congress on Thursday. “I will tell you it gave me an unbelievable sense of calm, knowing that at, at that point, it was in God’s hands.”

“Our prayers have been answered,” thundered House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., from the dais, recognizing Scalise to speak.

“Thank God that our prayers are answered,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., echoed at a press conference an hour or so later.

Joy marked Scalise’s return to Capitol Hill. But his journey was steeped in prayer.

And people prayed.

Prayers continued.

Prayers poured in when Scalise’s condition slipped back to critical because of infection issues and another surgery in early July. But that was expected from the beginning. There would be ups and downs. Dips and turns.

But there seemed to be one constant.

Prayer.

“We saw prayer groups and well wishes being given from people we had never met before,” said Scalise on the House floor. “The power of prayer was something else I saw firsthand.”

Scalise met briefly with Ryan in the Speaker’s Ceremonial Office just off the House floor before Capitol security officials ushered him into the chamber to speak. When asked how it was to see his colleague, an obviously shaken Ryan sighed, paused and kind of shook his head.

“There are no words,” the speaker said.

Religion is apparently weakening in America. A new report from the Pew Research Center shows that the percentage of Americans who say they believe in God, pray daily and attend church regularly is declining.

Among the findings:

The share of Americans who say they are ""absolutely certain"" that God exists has dropped 8 percentage points, from 71 percent to 63 percent, since 2007, when the last comparable study was made.

The percentage of adults who describe themselves as ""religiously affiliated"" has shrunk 6 points since 2007, from 83 percent to 77 percent.

The shares of the U.S. adult population who consider religion ""very important"" to them, pray daily and attend services at least once a month have declined between 3 and 4 percentage points over the past eight years.

The shift is small but statistically significant, according to the authors, given that the changes have taken place in a relatively short period of time, and the survey sample is large enough (about 35,000 U.S. adults) to be considered reliable.

Skepticism about religion is especially evident among young people. The Pew study found that barely a quarter of ""millennials"" (born between 1981 and 1996) attend church services on a weekly basis, compared with more than half of U.S. adults born before 1946. Only about 4 in 10 millennials say religion is important in their lives, compared with more than half of those who are older, including two-thirds of those born before 1946.

The Pew researchers acknowledge that some young people may become more religious as they grow older, but their data suggest that the generational differences in religiosity could well endure. ""The oldest Millennials, now in their late 20s and early 30s, are generally less observant than they were seven years ago,"" the authors write. ""If these trends continue American society is likely to grow less religious even if those who are adults today maintain their current levels of religious commitment.""

The weakening of religious beliefs and practices has clear political overtones. The growth in the number of religiously unaffiliated people is largely benefiting Democrats, for whom ""nones"" are now the single largest religious constituency. Evangelicals, meanwhile, constitute the largest religious group in the Republican Party, and the share of evangelicals who identify with the Republicans has grown since 2007.

Indeed, the Pew report suggests that polarization along religious lines may be increasing in the United States. While the percentage of Americans who say they don't affiliate with any religious tradition is growing, those people who still identify with a religion are becoming even more devout.

''
I thought after gay marriage was legalized nationwide by the Supreme Court that we might get a well-deserved break from the “ culture wars , ” but oh , how wrong I ’ ve been . Instead , it ’ s open season on anyone who threatens Christian hegemony . Recently , Bill O ’ Reilly , the meanest , angriest and most unholy bastard who has ever made a living by screaming at strangers , claimed that “ secularism ” is responsible for mass murder in America . O ’ Reilly glosses over the fact that religious wars have dominated human history , but if you need something more current , statistics show that 7 percent of the general population self-identifies as agnostic or atheist , while less than 1 percent of the prison population identifies as such . We don ’ t commit crimes on the scale that religious people do .
O ’ Reilly ’ s outrageous slander underscores the two-front religious attack on democracy . On one side you have misguided “ true believers , ” like Kim Davis , famous for using her government position to deny gay people their right to marry . On the other you have the professional exploiter class , a long list of people that includes O ’ Reilly , Ted Cruz , Mike Huckabee and a parade of political and pundit rabble . What ’ s striking is that the loudest , most outspoken “ Christian warriors ” are the most flawed and perverted bunch of people collectively found outside a bordello . The entire “ persecution industry ” is loaded with hypocrisy .
The supporters of Kim Davis continue to ignore her own colorful life , as she proclaims herself the highest judge of morality , a final arbiter of who is entitled to public accommodation at a government office and to marry the person they love . I ’ m most struck not by her hypocrisy but rather by her authenticity . She wept when released from jail in a cry out to her god and her own humanity , at the same moment she denied the fundamental dignity and humanity of others . Yet , I don ’ t hold that against her .

— Matthew 7:5

I thought after gay marriage was legalized nationwide by the Supreme Court that we might get a well-deserved break from the “culture wars,” but oh, how wrong I’ve been. Instead, it’s open season on anyone who threatens Christian hegemony. Recently, Bill O’Reilly, the meanest, angriest and most unholy bastard who has ever made a living by screaming at strangers, claimed that “secularism” is responsible for mass murder in America. O’Reilly glosses over the fact that religious wars have dominated human history, but if you need something more current, statistics show that 7 percent of the general population self-identifies as agnostic or atheist, while less than 1 percent of the prison population identifies as such. We don’t commit crimes on the scale that religious people do.

O’Reilly’s outrageous slander underscores the two-front religious attack on democracy. On one side you have misguided “true believers,” like Kim Davis, famous for using her government position to deny gay people their right to marry. On the other you have the professional exploiter class, a long list of people that includes O’Reilly, Ted Cruz, Mike Huckabee and a parade of political and pundit rabble. What’s striking is that the loudest, most outspoken “Christian warriors” are the most flawed and perverted bunch of people collectively found outside a bordello. The entire “persecution industry” is loaded with hypocrisy.

The supporters of Kim Davis continue to ignore her own colorful life, as she proclaims herself the highest judge of morality, a final arbiter of who is entitled to public accommodation at a government office and to marry the person they love. I’m most struck not by her hypocrisy but rather by her authenticity. She wept when released from jail in a cry out to her god and her own humanity, at the same moment she denied the fundamental dignity and humanity of others. Yet, I don’t hold that against her. She’s an obvious rube, a useful and backward hick who is being exploited by others for cash and votes. As a rehabilitated rube myself, I feel sorry for her. Despite her hypocrisy and foundational ignorance, she’s far too useful to be cast aside.

As a point of contrast, look at Josh Dugger, both a true believer and a member of the exploiter class. He’s also a great example of the breathtaking hypocrisy that exemplifies American Christianity. He made a good living at the Family Research Council by shaming other people for their “sins,” while he racked up an impressive list of sexual conquests, all while dodging his own past as a child molester. If you were to write a novel about a fall from grace, you'd struggle to use Duggar’s life, because it would almost be too unbelievable. We have not seen the last of this doughy clown, and I wonder if he’ll come back a Christian or if he’ll embrace his inner freak and launch a line of Jesus-themed French Ticklers? Only time will tell.

Yet I pity Josh, just as I pity Kim. They are both pawns in a high-stakes religious long con. You can tell the players from the exploiters by the constant expression of downtrodden misery worn by the former, as they deny their own sexual natures, hide their own “sins” and decry entire groups of other human beings. They all look so pained and miserable all the time.

The big names at Fox often have the same kind of horrendous hypocrisy, and O’Reilly is a perfect example. While he bashes the “nihilism of secular America” with one hand, he shells out millions to settle his brazen sexual harassment with the other. No ones' hands are clean.

Atheists, like me, have said mean things about Christianity and religious people, but have also tried to engage with liberal Christians. The most reasonable Christians I know are not the voice of American Christianity. Those who love and promote a more nuanced version of the faith have a duty to get their house in order. Liberal Christians have been either ineffective or unwilling to tame the excesses in their pews.

The reason I am so troubled about this ongoing culture war is that it is a distraction. When people obsess about gay marriage, abortion and shoehorning Christianity into public schools, they don’t notice their country is being auctioned off to the highest bidder. Religious, blue collar, salt of the earth types like to blame immigrants and “Obummer” for their inability to find or keep a meaningful job, rather than the rightwing, religious politicians that shovel money upward while slicing programs that benefit the working class.
