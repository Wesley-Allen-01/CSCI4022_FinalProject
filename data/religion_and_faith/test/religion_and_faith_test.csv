The meeting between Pope Francis and President Obama at the White House continues a tradition going back nearly a century between U.S. presidents and the head of the Roman Catholic Church.

The talks are private, often personal and, always, they take place against the backdrop of the politics of the time. That was the case at the very first such meeting, at the Vatican, as Europe was recovering from World War I.

Woodrow Wilson, the growing Catholic Democrats in the U.S. and the first awkward moment between a president and pope

In January of 1919, President Woodrow Wilson was on a tour of Europe that lasted more than six months. The main purpose of the trip was the Paris Peace Conference, but Wilson's itinerary included Italy, as well.

Initially, there was no plan to visit Pope Benedict XV, a pontiff who was deeply involved in ways the church could help Europe rebuild and emerge from the darkness and destruction of the war years. But at the suggestion of an American cardinal, Wilson did go to the Vatican for an audience with Benedict.

They discussed the recovery effort, but politics were in the back of Wilson's mind as well, according to the Rev. Matt Malone, editor of America, a magazine put out by the Jesuit order of the Catholic Church. Malone notes the growing working-class Catholic population in U.S. cities at the time.

""You're beginning to see Catholics, who were basically European immigrants, as a force within the Democrat Party,"" Malone says, ""and it was absolutely a part of the political calculation.""

Wilson's Vatican stop also included the first awkward moment between a president and a pope. At the end of the meeting, an aide told Benedict it was time for him to bless the group, but Wilson, a Presbyterian, was not interested in being blessed.

The anti-war message for George W. Bush

In 27 years, John Paul held more than a dozen meetings with U.S. presidents. One of the most famous — and most uncomfortable for an American leader — came late in his life, in 2004 with George W. Bush.

The setting was the Vatican, and the pope was opposed to the U.S. war in Iraq. In an ornate ceremonial hall, John Paul and President Bush sat side by side, the pope clearly infirmed because of advanced Parkinson's disease, his hands shaking, his voice halting and barely intelligible, as he read a statement in English

It was hard to make out exactly what the pope was saying because of his ailment, but the message was clear — a strong condemnation of the war.

It took 40 years and three bouts of cancer for Larry Giacalone to report his claim of childhood sexual abuse at the hands of a Boston priest named Richard Donahue .
Giacalone sued Donahue in 2017 , alleging the priest molested him in 1976 , when Giacalone was 12 and Donahue was serving at Sacred Heart Parish . The lawsuit never went to trial , but a compensation program set up by the archdiocese concluded that Giacalone “ suffered physical injuries and emotional injuries as a result of physical abuse ” and directed the archdiocese to pay him $ 73,000 .

Even after the claim was settled and the compensation paid in February 2019 , however , the archdiocese didn ’ t publish Donahue ’ s name on its list of accused priests . Nor did it three months later when Giacalone ’ s lawyer , Mitchell Garabedian , criticized the church publicly for not adding Donahue ’ s name to the list .
Church leaders finally added Donahue to the list last month after ███ asked why he hadn ’ t been included . But that , too , sowed confusion . Despite the determination that Giacalone was entitled to compensation , Donahue ’ s name was added to a portion of the list for priests accused in cases deemed “ unsubstantiated ” — where the archdiocese says it does not have sufficient evidence to determine whether the clergy member committed the alleged abuse .
“ To award a victim a substantial amount of money , yet claim that the accused is not a pedophile , is an insult to one ’ s intelligence , ” said Garabedian , who has handled hundreds of abuse cases over the last 25 years . “ It ’ s a classic case of the archdiocese ducking , delaying and avoiding issues . ”
Donahue , in an interview with ███ , denied the allegation by Giacalone .
Search the Database Search lists of U.S. Catholic clergy that have been deemed credibly accused of sexual abuse or misconduct . Credibly Accused Over the last year and a half , U.S. dioceses and religious orders covering most of the Catholics in the country have released lists of what they regard as “ credibly accused ” abusers who have served in their ranks . You can search these lists in our interactive database .
Over the last year and a half , the majority of U.S. dioceses , as well as nearly two dozen religious orders , have released lists of abusers currently or formerly in their ranks . The revelations were no coincidence : They were spurred by a 2018 Pennsylvania grand jury report , which named hundreds of priests as part of a statewide clergy abuse investigation . Nationwide , the names of more than 5,800 clergy members have been released so far , representing the most comprehensive step toward transparency yet by a Catholic Church dogged by its long history of denying and burying abuse by priests .
But even as bishops have dedicated these lists to abuse victims and depicted the disclosures as a public acknowledgement of victims ’ suffering , it has become clear that numerous alleged abusers have been omitted and that there is no standard for determining who each diocese considers credibly accused .
A spokesman for the Boston Archdiocese initially said Donahue wasn ’ t on its list of accused priests because he was still being investigated and subsequently called the delay an “ oversight . ”

Even when dioceses and religious orders identify credibly accused clergy members , the information they provide about those named varies widely . Some jurisdictions turn over far more specifics about problem priests — from where they worked to the number of their victims to the details of their wrongdoing — than others .
The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops , or USCCB , has issued no instructions on disclosures related to credibly accused priests , leaving individual dioceses and religious orders to decide for themselves how much or how little to publish . The USCCB says it does not have the authority to order dioceses to release names or to resolve disputes over who should be on the lists , though in 2002 after a scandal in Boston , the conference did put in place new protocols intended to ensure alleged abuse by clergy was reported and tracked .
“ Recognizing the authority of the local bishop , and the fact that state and local laws vary , the decision of whether and how to best release lists and comply with varying civil reporting laws have been the responsibility of individual dioceses , ” said Chieko Noguchi , a USCCB spokeswoman .
While the USCCB can propose policies for church leaders in the U.S. , the bishops themselves are appointed by the pope and answer to him .
███ has collected the 178 lists released by U.S. dioceses and religious orders as of Jan. 20 and created a searchable database that allows users to look up clergy members by name , diocese or parish . This represents the first comprehensive picture of the information released publicly by bishops around the country . Some names appear multiple times . In many cases , that accounts for priests who were accused in more than one location . In other instances , dioceses have acknowledged when priests who served in their jurisdiction have been reported for abuse elsewhere .
Kathleen McChesney , a former FBI official who helped establish a new set of child protection protocols within the USCCB in the early 2000s , has urged bishops and religious orders for nearly two decades to create a comprehensive list of accused clergy . She said our database will allow the public to better track dioceses ’ disclosures , rather than seeing each list in isolation .
“ People don ’ t know where to look , ” McChesney said . “ The contribution of the one list will help a lot of people to perhaps identify someone that they believe abused them . ”
Still , much crucial information remains missing . Despite the recent surge of releases , 41 dioceses and dozens more religious orders have yet to publish lists , including five of seven dioceses in Florida , home to more than 2 million Catholics .
Where Catholics Are Still Waiting for Transparency Forty-one dioceses and eparchies serving over 9 million Catholics in the United States have not released lists . These are the 10 largest . See all dioceses and look up credibly accused clergy in our interactive database . Diocese State Catholics Archdiocese of the Military Services District of Columbia 1,800,000 Diocese of Rockville Centre New York 1,508,515 Diocese of Fresno California 1,200,000 Archdiocese of Miami Florida 790,530 Archdiocese of San Francisco California 444,800 Diocese of Palm Beach Florida 297,070 Diocese of Worcester Massachusetts 281,690 Diocese of Fall River Massachusetts 269,102 Diocese of Venice Florida 237,120 Diocese of Grand Rapids Michigan 222,903 Catholic population numbers from the 2019 Pontifical Yearbook ( Annuario Pontificio )
The database also doesn ’ t include many accused clergy members whom bishops have yet to acknowledge , even if they ’ ve issued lists . An organization called Bishop Accountability has long maintained its own database of publicly accused priests , drawn from court records , news articles and church documents . The organization ’ s list includes more than 450 names connected to dioceses that have not released disclosures .
The Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests , or SNAP , an advocacy organization for victims of clergy abuse , has pushed dioceses to identify known abusers and turn over records on them for decades . This process has finally begun , but the church ’ s obdurate culture of concealment remains , said David Clohessy , who led the group for nearly 30 years .
“ They continue to be as secretive as possible , parceling out the least amount of information possible and only under great duress , ” Clohessy said . “ They are absolute masters at hairsplitting — always have been and still are . ”
“ Do we now know the names of more predator priests than before ? Yes , of course . Are we anywhere near full transparency ? Absolutely not . ”
Larry Giacalone at his home . Giacalone , 55 , says Donahue molested him at the age of 12 at his East Boston parish . ( Kayana Szymczak for ███ )
Until recently , only a few dozen bishops had released lists of priests with credible allegations against them . Many did so only when compelled by courts , as a condition of bankruptcy proceedings .
That changed after August 2018 , when the Pennsylvania attorney general , Josh Shapiro , published a 900-page grand jury report detailing not only abuse but a systematic cover-up by church leaders throughout the state . The report came just weeks after the resignation of then- Cardinal Theodore McCarrick , the former archbishop of Washington , D.C. , and one of the highest ranking Catholic leaders ever felled by abuse allegations .
“ The overall feel was like 2002 happening all over again , ” Kevin Eckery , a Diocese of San Diego senior administrator , said , referring to the intense scrutiny that followed a Pulitzer Prize-winning Boston Globe investigation into sexual abuse by priests . “ You could see that there was a need for a response that was about action and not a response that was about more words . ”
Many of the 178 dioceses that have released new or updated lists of accused clergy since last year have cited the Pennsylvania grand jury report as a reason for doing so .
Still , without a consensus among church leaders on what constitutes a credible accusation , bishops have used vastly different standards to determine who should be named .
The Archdiocese of Seattle , which released its list prior to the grand jury report , began by dividing allegations into three categories : cases in which priests admitted the allegations or where allegations were “ established ” by reports from multiple victims ; cases that clearly could not have happened ; and cases that fell into a gray area , like those that were never fully investigated at the time they were reported . The archdiocese decided it would name priests whose cases fell into the first category and leave out the second group , but it sought additional guidance on the third set of cases .
“ There ’ s the question of who determines it to be credible , ” said Mary Santi , the chancellor and chief of staff for the Archdiocese of Seattle . “ We decided that we couldn ’ t be the determiners of that . ”
The Seattle Archdiocese brought in McChesney to help choose which names to disclose . Dozens of dioceses have turned to outside advisers , hiring former judges , former local law enforcement agents and law firms while others relied on internal review boards , composed of mostly non-clergy members .
Ultimately , dioceses have set different limits on what to publish . The Archdiocese of Kansas City in Kansas disclosed the names of priests even in cases in which officials could not substantiate the allegations themselves . In New Hampshire , the Diocese of Manchester ’ s bishop also opted for greater transparency than most , disclosing clergy members who were currently under investigation and who had died before an inquiry was complete .
Other jurisdictions , however , drew tighter lines , sometimes based on idiosyncratic criteria . In Nebraska , the Archdiocese of Omaha leaves out names of seminarians with “ substantiated ” allegations of abuse against minors . In Ohio , the Diocese of Toledo did not identify priests who died before a victim came forward because they “ posed no threat , ” the diocese ’ s website explained .
SNAP leaders have pushed the diocese to publish those names , so far to no avail . “ Their lack of transparency is devastating to those left in their wake , ” Claudia Vercellotti , a SNAP leader in Toledo , said . “ It defies logic that even when the church leader is dead , they are still protecting them over offering healing and transparency to the victims . ”
Many dioceses have chosen not to include members of religious orders , such as the Jesuits , who have been accused of abuse . Religious order members , who make up 30 % of U.S. priests , are taught and ordained within those orders , but they often spend much of their time working in the parishes and schools of local dioceses .
The Archdiocese of Milwaukee , at the direction of its court-appointed bankruptcy committee , discloses extensive information about each accused priest it names , including timelines of their careers and documentation of when and where they abused their victims .
But it leaves out religious order priests and priests who died before victims reported the abuse . Names of the deceased are only added if enough victims come forward to “ show a trend , ” though the archdiocese does not define how many allegations that would require .
Jerry Topczewski , chief of staff for Milwaukee Archbishop Jerome Listecki , said there ’ s room for debate over which accused clergy members should be named , but each diocese has to draw the line somewhere .
“ At some point you have to make a decision , ” Topczewski said . “ Someone ’ s always going to say your list isn ’ t good enough , which we have people say , ‘ Your list is incomplete. ’ Well , I only control the list I can control and that ’ s diocesan priests . ”
Jerry Topczewski , chief of staff for Milwaukee Archbishop Jerome Listecki . ( Darren Hauck , special to ███ )
It ’ s impossible to know how many accused clergy members dioceses have opted not to put on their lists .
Bishop Accountability applies different standards for inclusion on its list than church leaders , tracking public accusations against nuns and other clergy members often left off the official rolls .
As a result , there are sometimes substantial gaps between the group ’ s tallies and those of dioceses .
The Archdiocese of Boston currently lists 171 names . Bishop Accountability lists 279 , including dozens of religious order priests omitted from the official list as well as several priests who died before victims came forward .
“ For every person who ’ s left off a list , bishops ought to be aware that they are retraumatizing survivors and doubling the insult and doubling the pain , ” Terence McKiernan , the founder of Bishop Accountability , said .
Over his 40-year career , Alfredo Prado was accused of abusing children repeatedly , in nearly every corner of Texas where he was assigned by his order , the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate .
Today , he ’ s named on six separate diocesan lists of credibly accused priests . Yet each jurisdiction gives different information about him , making it difficult to piece together the arc of his career , the totality of his wrongdoing or what became of him .
The year Prado was ordained is shown on one list as 1958 and on two lists as 1957 . The Diocese of San Angelo and the Diocese of Victoria refer to him as “ Alfred ” rather than “ Alfredo. ” San Antonio is the only diocese that discloses the total number of children he was accused of abusing within its jurisdiction , five .
His status is also characterized differently from one diocese to another . He ’ s described as suspended by the Diocese of Corpus Christi , dismissed from his religious order and the clerical state by the Archdiocese of San Antonio , and laicized ( or returned to the lay state ) by the Diocese of San Angelo . The Diocese of Amarillo adds that he fled to Costa Rica , but it doesn ’ t say when ( according to news reports , it was in the early 2000s ) . The Diocese of San Angelo says Prado died , but doesn ’ t list the year . Only the Diocese of Victoria provides a complete bio for Prado , noting each time his status changed , though the list does not confirm he ’ s dead .
███ contacted Prado ’ s order , which has not released its own list ; an administrator said the order did not know if Prado was alive or dead .
The Several Variations of Alfredo Prado Details published by dioceses about Alfredo Prado , a former priest accused of sexual abuse , are inconsistent among the six that listed him . Loading ...
Prado ’ s story is a striking example of inconsistencies in the information that bishops disclose about accused clergy members . Perhaps most remarkable is that it happened in Texas , where church leaders have made an effort to coordinate their releases . Nationally , the disparities in disclosures are even more pronounced .
The Range of Disclosure Lists posted by the Diocese of Sacramento , California , the Diocese of Ogdensburg , New York , and the Diocese of San Bernardino , California , show varied levels of information . Allen Tan/███
At one end is the Diocese of Sacramento in California , which issues a release on each credibly accused clergy member , outlining identifying information that helps distinguish one priest from another such as their ordination dates , seminaries , birthdays and every place they served within the diocese . Leaders also disclose each accusation submitted against the clergy member , including the year it was reported , the nature of the abuse and the victim ’ s age and gender .
The Diocese of Ogdensburg in upstate New York is at the other end of the spectrum . Its list provides the first and last name of accused priests , with hardly any additional information .
Most disclosures fall somewhere in between . The Diocese of San Bernardino in California , for example , outlines each clergy members ’ current status in the church , the assignments they held within the diocese , the dates of abuse and when the diocese reported the incident to law enforcement .
Dioceses consistently label clergy who have died as “ deceased , ” which accounts for about half of the priests in ███ ’ s database . Jurisdictions are far less uniform in giving information about living members ’ current locations or standing in the church . Over 700 clergy members ’ status isn ’ t given or is marked as “ unknown . ”
Details about credibly accused priests ’ abuse are scarce . Church leaders have disclosed the number of allegations made against roughly 10 % of the clergy members they ’ ve named , according to a ███ data analysis .
In the early 2000s , dioceses across the country filled out detailed surveys compiled by researchers at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice for the first-ever nationwide study of sexual abuse by clergy . The USCCB mandated the study as one of the new safety initiatives outlined in the 2002 Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People . Dioceses have continued reporting new allegations annually to the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate at Georgetown University .
Two John Jay researchers who helped diocesan employees fill out the initial surveys say that sometimes the lack of details about abuse by priests stems from sparse recordkeeping or different ways of defining abuse , especially when it comes to older allegations .
“ It was thought about differently , so it was recorded differently than it would be today , ” one of the researchers , Karen Terry , said .
Still , dioceses have other information that they often do not disclose , including schools or parishes clergy members were assigned to while serving in a diocese .
A map at the headquarters of the Archdiocese of Milwaukee shows its 10 counties , churches and schools . ( Darren Hauck , special to ███ )
McChesney , whose firm , Kinsale Management Consulting , has worked with a few dozen dioceses and religious orders on their disclosures over more than a decade , says dioceses typically keep thorough records of who is serving and when .
“ If you want to find out if somebody was baptized in 1889 in La Crosse , Wisconsin , you can find that , ” she said .
Disclosing those details can help survivors , especially those who were young at the time of their abuse , to distinguish between clergy with common or similar names , McChesney said .
Only about 58 % of the clergy members listed have information about what parishes or schools they served in . Often , the assignment histories provided by dioceses list only a priest ’ s appointments within that diocese , not where they worked or what positions they held over the rest of their careers .
“ It ’ s so simple , ” McChesney said . “ All it takes is a good research look and frankly , if you look sometimes at websites of dioceses and universities in the area , you can put that together . ”
Mary Gautier , a senior research associate at the Georgetown center , said smaller dioceses with limited budgets don ’ t always have the money or staff to dig through their archives .
“ One thing that the church is very good at is recordkeeping ... but it ’ s very , very time consuming and labor intensive to really go through years and years and years of personnel records and track all this out , ” Gautier said . “ And I mean doing hand searches . There ’ s none of this computerized , of course . ”
After his years in Boston , Donahue spent much of the last 20 years of his career serving in Honduras , where he established and ran schools funded by his organization , the Olancho Aid Foundation . He was back in the United States for medical care in 2015 when he was informed of the first of two abuse allegations made against him . The second accusation , by Giacalone , came in 2017 .
In the interview with ███ , Donahue denied both men ’ s allegations and said he assumed his accusers had confused him with someone else or were looking for a payoff from the church .

It took 40 years and three bouts of cancer for Larry Giacalone to report his claim of childhood sexual abuse at the hands of a Boston priest named Richard Donahue.

Giacalone sued Donahue in 2017, alleging the priest molested him in 1976, when Giacalone was 12 and Donahue was serving at Sacred Heart Parish. The lawsuit never went to trial, but a compensation program set up by the archdiocese concluded that Giacalone “suffered physical injuries and emotional injuries as a result of physical abuse” and directed the archdiocese to pay him $73,000.

Even after the claim was settled and the compensation paid in February 2019, however, the archdiocese didn’t publish Donahue’s name on its list of accused priests. Nor did it three months later when Giacalone’s lawyer, Mitchell Garabedian, criticized the church publicly for not adding Donahue’s name to the list.

Church leaders finally added Donahue to the list last month after ProPublica asked why he hadn’t been included. But that, too, sowed confusion. Despite the determination that Giacalone was entitled to compensation, Donahue’s name was added to a portion of the list for priests accused in cases deemed “unsubstantiated” — where the archdiocese says it does not have sufficient evidence to determine whether the clergy member committed the alleged abuse.

“To award a victim a substantial amount of money, yet claim that the accused is not a pedophile, is an insult to one’s intelligence,” said Garabedian, who has handled hundreds of abuse cases over the last 25 years. “It’s a classic case of the archdiocese ducking, delaying and avoiding issues.”

Donahue, in an interview with ProPublica, denied the allegation by Giacalone.

Search the Database Search lists of U.S. Catholic clergy that have been deemed credibly accused of sexual abuse or misconduct. Credibly Accused Over the last year and a half, U.S. dioceses and religious orders covering most of the Catholics in the country have released lists of what they regard as “credibly accused” abusers who have served in their ranks. You can search these lists in our interactive database.

Over the last year and a half, the majority of U.S. dioceses, as well as nearly two dozen religious orders, have released lists of abusers currently or formerly in their ranks. The revelations were no coincidence: They were spurred by a 2018 Pennsylvania grand jury report, which named hundreds of priests as part of a statewide clergy abuse investigation. Nationwide, the names of more than 5,800 clergy members have been released so far, representing the most comprehensive step toward transparency yet by a Catholic Church dogged by its long history of denying and burying abuse by priests.

But even as bishops have dedicated these lists to abuse victims and depicted the disclosures as a public acknowledgement of victims’ suffering, it has become clear that numerous alleged abusers have been omitted and that there is no standard for determining who each diocese considers credibly accused.

A spokesman for the Boston Archdiocese initially said Donahue wasn’t on its list of accused priests because he was still being investigated and subsequently called the delay an “oversight.”

Even when dioceses and religious orders identify credibly accused clergy members, the information they provide about those named varies widely. Some jurisdictions turn over far more specifics about problem priests — from where they worked to the number of their victims to the details of their wrongdoing — than others.

The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, or USCCB, has issued no instructions on disclosures related to credibly accused priests, leaving individual dioceses and religious orders to decide for themselves how much or how little to publish. The USCCB says it does not have the authority to order dioceses to release names or to resolve disputes over who should be on the lists, though in 2002 after a scandal in Boston, the conference did put in place new protocols intended to ensure alleged abuse by clergy was reported and tracked.

“Recognizing the authority of the local bishop, and the fact that state and local laws vary, the decision of whether and how to best release lists and comply with varying civil reporting laws have been the responsibility of individual dioceses,” said Chieko Noguchi, a USCCB spokeswoman.

While the USCCB can propose policies for church leaders in the U.S., the bishops themselves are appointed by the pope and answer to him.

ProPublica has collected the 178 lists released by U.S. dioceses and religious orders as of Jan. 20 and created a searchable database that allows users to look up clergy members by name, diocese or parish. This represents the first comprehensive picture of the information released publicly by bishops around the country. Some names appear multiple times. In many cases, that accounts for priests who were accused in more than one location. In other instances, dioceses have acknowledged when priests who served in their jurisdiction have been reported for abuse elsewhere.

Kathleen McChesney, a former FBI official who helped establish a new set of child protection protocols within the USCCB in the early 2000s, has urged bishops and religious orders for nearly two decades to create a comprehensive list of accused clergy. She said our database will allow the public to better track dioceses’ disclosures, rather than seeing each list in isolation.

“People don’t know where to look,” McChesney said. “The contribution of the one list will help a lot of people to perhaps identify someone that they believe abused them.”

Still, much crucial information remains missing. Despite the recent surge of releases, 41 dioceses and dozens more religious orders have yet to publish lists, including five of seven dioceses in Florida, home to more than 2 million Catholics.

Where Catholics Are Still Waiting for Transparency Forty-one dioceses and eparchies serving over 9 million Catholics in the United States have not released lists. These are the 10 largest. See all dioceses and look up credibly accused clergy in our interactive database. Diocese State Catholics Archdiocese of the Military Services District of Columbia 1,800,000 Diocese of Rockville Centre New York 1,508,515 Diocese of Fresno California 1,200,000 Archdiocese of Miami Florida 790,530 Archdiocese of San Francisco California 444,800 Diocese of Palm Beach Florida 297,070 Diocese of Worcester Massachusetts 281,690 Diocese of Fall River Massachusetts 269,102 Diocese of Venice Florida 237,120 Diocese of Grand Rapids Michigan 222,903 Catholic population numbers from the 2019 Pontifical Yearbook (Annuario Pontificio)

The database also doesn’t include many accused clergy members whom bishops have yet to acknowledge, even if they’ve issued lists. An organization called Bishop Accountability has long maintained its own database of publicly accused priests, drawn from court records, news articles and church documents. The organization’s list includes more than 450 names connected to dioceses that have not released disclosures.

The Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, or SNAP, an advocacy organization for victims of clergy abuse, has pushed dioceses to identify known abusers and turn over records on them for decades. This process has finally begun, but the church’s obdurate culture of concealment remains, said David Clohessy, who led the group for nearly 30 years.

“They continue to be as secretive as possible, parceling out the least amount of information possible and only under great duress,” Clohessy said. “They are absolute masters at hairsplitting — always have been and still are.”

“Do we now know the names of more predator priests than before? Yes, of course. Are we anywhere near full transparency? Absolutely not.”

A Lack of Standards

Until recently, only a few dozen bishops had released lists of priests with credible allegations against them. Many did so only when compelled by courts, as a condition of bankruptcy proceedings.

That changed after August 2018, when the Pennsylvania attorney general, Josh Shapiro, published a 900-page grand jury report detailing not only abuse but a systematic cover-up by church leaders throughout the state. The report came just weeks after the resignation of then- Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, the former archbishop of Washington, D.C., and one of the highest ranking Catholic leaders ever felled by abuse allegations.

“The overall feel was like 2002 happening all over again,” Kevin Eckery, a Diocese of San Diego senior administrator, said, referring to the intense scrutiny that followed a Pulitzer Prize-winning Boston Globe investigation into sexual abuse by priests. “You could see that there was a need for a response that was about action and not a response that was about more words.”

Many of the 178 dioceses that have released new or updated lists of accused clergy since last year have cited the Pennsylvania grand jury report as a reason for doing so.

Pennsylvania Grand Jury Report Spurs New Disclosures Loading...

Still, without a consensus among church leaders on what constitutes a credible accusation, bishops have used vastly different standards to determine who should be named.

The Archdiocese of Seattle, which released its list prior to the grand jury report, began by dividing allegations into three categories: cases in which priests admitted the allegations or where allegations were “established” by reports from multiple victims; cases that clearly could not have happened; and cases that fell into a gray area, like those that were never fully investigated at the time they were reported. The archdiocese decided it would name priests whose cases fell into the first category and leave out the second group, but it sought additional guidance on the third set of cases.

“There’s the question of who determines it to be credible,” said Mary Santi, the chancellor and chief of staff for the Archdiocese of Seattle. “We decided that we couldn’t be the determiners of that.”

The Seattle Archdiocese brought in McChesney to help choose which names to disclose. Dozens of dioceses have turned to outside advisers, hiring former judges, former local law enforcement agents and law firms while others relied on internal review boards, composed of mostly non-clergy members.

Ultimately, dioceses have set different limits on what to publish. The Archdiocese of Kansas City in Kansas disclosed the names of priests even in cases in which officials could not substantiate the allegations themselves. In New Hampshire, the Diocese of Manchester’s bishop also opted for greater transparency than most, disclosing clergy members who were currently under investigation and who had died before an inquiry was complete.

Other jurisdictions, however, drew tighter lines, sometimes based on idiosyncratic criteria. In Nebraska, the Archdiocese of Omaha leaves out names of seminarians with “substantiated” allegations of abuse against minors. In Ohio, the Diocese of Toledo did not identify priests who died before a victim came forward because they “posed no threat,” the diocese’s website explained.

SNAP leaders have pushed the diocese to publish those names, so far to no avail. “Their lack of transparency is devastating to those left in their wake,” Claudia Vercellotti, a SNAP leader in Toledo, said. “It defies logic that even when the church leader is dead, they are still protecting them over offering healing and transparency to the victims.”

Many dioceses have chosen not to include members of religious orders, such as the Jesuits, who have been accused of abuse. Religious order members, who make up 30% of U.S. priests, are taught and ordained within those orders, but they often spend much of their time working in the parishes and schools of local dioceses.

The Archdiocese of Milwaukee, at the direction of its court-appointed bankruptcy committee, discloses extensive information about each accused priest it names, including timelines of their careers and documentation of when and where they abused their victims.

But it leaves out religious order priests and priests who died before victims reported the abuse. Names of the deceased are only added if enough victims come forward to “show a trend,” though the archdiocese does not define how many allegations that would require.

Jerry Topczewski, chief of staff for Milwaukee Archbishop Jerome Listecki, said there’s room for debate over which accused clergy members should be named, but each diocese has to draw the line somewhere.

“At some point you have to make a decision,” Topczewski said. “Someone’s always going to say your list isn’t good enough, which we have people say, ‘Your list is incomplete.’ Well, I only control the list I can control and that’s diocesan priests.”

It’s impossible to know how many accused clergy members dioceses have opted not to put on their lists.

Bishop Accountability applies different standards for inclusion on its list than church leaders, tracking public accusations against nuns and other clergy members often left off the official rolls.

As a result, there are sometimes substantial gaps between the group’s tallies and those of dioceses.

The Archdiocese of Boston currently lists 171 names. Bishop Accountability lists 279, including dozens of religious order priests omitted from the official list as well as several priests who died before victims came forward.

“For every person who’s left off a list, bishops ought to be aware that they are retraumatizing survivors and doubling the insult and doubling the pain,” Terence McKiernan, the founder of Bishop Accountability, said.

Lost in the Archives

Over his 40-year career, Alfredo Prado was accused of abusing children repeatedly, in nearly every corner of Texas where he was assigned by his order, the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate.

Today, he’s named on six separate diocesan lists of credibly accused priests. Yet each jurisdiction gives different information about him, making it difficult to piece together the arc of his career, the totality of his wrongdoing or what became of him.

The year Prado was ordained is shown on one list as 1958 and on two lists as 1957. The Diocese of San Angelo and the Diocese of Victoria refer to him as “Alfred” rather than “Alfredo.” San Antonio is the only diocese that discloses the total number of children he was accused of abusing within its jurisdiction, five.

His status is also characterized differently from one diocese to another. He’s described as suspended by the Diocese of Corpus Christi, dismissed from his religious order and the clerical state by the Archdiocese of San Antonio, and laicized (or returned to the lay state) by the Diocese of San Angelo. The Diocese of Amarillo adds that he fled to Costa Rica, but it doesn’t say when (according to news reports, it was in the early 2000s). The Diocese of San Angelo says Prado died, but doesn’t list the year. Only the Diocese of Victoria provides a complete bio for Prado, noting each time his status changed, though the list does not confirm he’s dead.

ProPublica contacted Prado’s order, which has not released its own list; an administrator said the order did not know if Prado was alive or dead.

The Several Variations of Alfredo Prado Details published by dioceses about Alfredo Prado, a former priest accused of sexual abuse, are inconsistent among the six that listed him. Loading...

Prado’s story is a striking example of inconsistencies in the information that bishops disclose about accused clergy members. Perhaps most remarkable is that it happened in Texas, where church leaders have made an effort to coordinate their releases. Nationally, the disparities in disclosures are even more pronounced.

The Range of Disclosure Lists posted by the Diocese of Sacramento, California, the Diocese of Ogdensburg, New York, and the Diocese of San Bernardino, California, show varied levels of information. Allen Tan/ProPublica

At one end is the Diocese of Sacramento in California, which issues a release on each credibly accused clergy member, outlining identifying information that helps distinguish one priest from another such as their ordination dates, seminaries, birthdays and every place they served within the diocese. Leaders also disclose each accusation submitted against the clergy member, including the year it was reported, the nature of the abuse and the victim’s age and gender.

The Diocese of Ogdensburg in upstate New York is at the other end of the spectrum. Its list provides the first and last name of accused priests, with hardly any additional information.

Most disclosures fall somewhere in between. The Diocese of San Bernardino in California, for example, outlines each clergy members’ current status in the church, the assignments they held within the diocese, the dates of abuse and when the diocese reported the incident to law enforcement.

Dioceses consistently label clergy who have died as “deceased,” which accounts for about half of the priests in ProPublica’s database. Jurisdictions are far less uniform in giving information about living members’ current locations or standing in the church. Over 700 clergy members’ status isn’t given or is marked as “unknown.”

Details about credibly accused priests’ abuse are scarce. Church leaders have disclosed the number of allegations made against roughly 10% of the clergy members they’ve named, according to a ProPublica data analysis.

In the early 2000s, dioceses across the country filled out detailed surveys compiled by researchers at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice for the first-ever nationwide study of sexual abuse by clergy. The USCCB mandated the study as one of the new safety initiatives outlined in the 2002 Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People. Dioceses have continued reporting new allegations annually to the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate at Georgetown University.

Two John Jay researchers who helped diocesan employees fill out the initial surveys say that sometimes the lack of details about abuse by priests stems from sparse recordkeeping or different ways of defining abuse, especially when it comes to older allegations.

“It was thought about differently, so it was recorded differently than it would be today,” one of the researchers, Karen Terry, said.

Still, dioceses have other information that they often do not disclose, including schools or parishes clergy members were assigned to while serving in a diocese.

McChesney, whose firm, Kinsale Management Consulting, has worked with a few dozen dioceses and religious orders on their disclosures over more than a decade, says dioceses typically keep thorough records of who is serving and when.

“If you want to find out if somebody was baptized in 1889 in La Crosse, Wisconsin, you can find that,” she said.

Disclosing those details can help survivors, especially those who were young at the time of their abuse, to distinguish between clergy with common or similar names, McChesney said.

Only about 58% of the clergy members listed have information about what parishes or schools they served in. Often, the assignment histories provided by dioceses list only a priest’s appointments within that diocese, not where they worked or what positions they held over the rest of their careers.

“It’s so simple,” McChesney said. “All it takes is a good research look and frankly, if you look sometimes at websites of dioceses and universities in the area, you can put that together.”

Mary Gautier, a senior research associate at the Georgetown center, said smaller dioceses with limited budgets don’t always have the money or staff to dig through their archives.

“One thing that the church is very good at is recordkeeping ... but it’s very, very time consuming and labor intensive to really go through years and years and years of personnel records and track all this out,” Gautier said. “And I mean doing hand searches. There’s none of this computerized, of course.”

Decades of Rage

After his years in Boston, Donahue spent much of the last 20 years of his career serving in Honduras, where he established and ran schools funded by his organization, the Olancho Aid Foundation. He was back in the United States for medical care in 2015 when he was informed of the first of two abuse allegations made against him. The second accusation, by Giacalone, came in 2017.

In the interview with ProPublica, Donahue denied both men’s allegations and said he assumed his accusers had confused him with someone else or were looking for a payoff from the church. One accuser says he was abused for several years, up until 1981, but Donahue noted that in 1980, he moved to another assignment, elsewhere in Massachusetts.

“I never met either one of them,” Donahue said in the interview at his house in Cape Cod. “From a faith perspective, I’m trying to think there’s a reason I’ve gone through this cross, for the last three years, with these false allegations. Why me? I don’t know.”

After the first abuse allegation, in 2015, Donahue was prohibited by the archdiocese from participating in public ministry or entering parish or school property and was barred from returning to his work in Honduras.

The accuser who came forward in 2015, also represented by Garabedian, has submitted a claim through the archdiocese’s compensation program and is waiting for the church to decide if the claim is credible, Garabedian said.

Giacalone, now 55, says Donahue’s abuse led to decades of rage, alcoholism and drug use. He said he started drinking the day Donahue touched him. “What was I going to turn to?” he told ProPublica. “I thought I’d get relief. The first couple times, yeah, it helped me forget. But getting stinking drunk doesn’t really do anything for you.”

Giacalone said that he was held back in school and dropped out at one point, and that he had trouble holding down work and had run-ins with the police from an early age. In December 2010, he faced assault charges after his wife told police he had threatened and pushed her; the charges were dropped after she refused to go forward with a case.

He doesn’t blame the dispute with his wife or other low points in his life directly on his sexual abuse, but says it colored everything that followed. “It all stems, mostly, from that incident,” he said.

When a reporter told Giacalone that the Boston Archdiocese had found his accusation against Donahue to be “unsubstantiated,” even after the decision that Giacalone had to be compensated, he shook his head.

Pew and Gallup — two of the most reputable polling firms in America — both come to a similar figure . About 10 percent of Americans say they do not believe in God , and this figure has been slowly creeping up over the decades .
But maybe this isn ’ t the whole story . University of Kentucky psychologists Will Gervais and Maxine Najle have long suspected that a lot of atheists aren ’ t showing up in these polls . The reason : Even in our increasingly secular society , there ’ s still a lot of stigma around not believing in God . So when a stranger conducting a poll calls and asks the question , it may be uncomfortable for many to answer truthfully .
Gervais and Najle recently conducted a new analysis on the prevalence of atheists in America . And they conclude the number of people who do not believe in God may be even double that counted by these polling firms .
“ There ’ s a lot of atheists in the closet , ” Gervais says . “ And ... if they knew there are lots of people just like them out there , that could potentially promote more tolerance . ”
People are embarrassed to tell strangers they don ’ t believe in God
Currently , if you ’ re seeking data to answer the question , “ How many Americans do not believe in God ? ” you have two main sources .
First is the Pew Research Center . Most recently , Pew found that around 3 percent of Americans say they are atheists . It also found that a larger group — around 9 percent — say they do not believe in God or a universal spirit . ( Which goes to show that you may not believe in God but could still be uncomfortable calling yourself an atheist — because that term implies a strong personal identity and an outright rejection of religious rituals . ) Gallup also regularly asks the question point blank — “ Do you believe in God ? ” The last time it asked , in 2016 , 10 percent of respondents said no .
Gervais ’ s experience studying the stigma around atheism the world over made him suspect these numbers are wrong .
Study after study has shown that most people ( even other atheists ) believe atheists are less moral . “ We ’ ll give participants a little vignette , a story about someone doing something immoral , and probe their intuition about who they think the perpetrator was , ” Gervais says . “ And time and time again , people intuitively assume whoever is out there doing immoral stuff doesn ’ t believe in God . ”
So it would make sense that when Pew or Gallup calls , people who don ’ t believe in God may be reluctant to say so . “ We shouldn ’ t expect people to give a stranger over the phone an honest answer to that question , ” Gervais says .
So recently , Gervais and Najle designed a test to find these “ closet atheists. ” Their results were recently published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science .
So if you can ’ t ask people outright whether they ’ re atheist and get an honest response , how do you go about finding them ?
Gervais and Najle set up a very subtle test . They sent a nationally representative poll to 2,000 Americans , who were randomly assigned to two conditions .
The first condition asked participants to read through a bunch of statements like , “ I am a vegetarian , ” “ I own a dog , ” and , “ I have a dishwasher in my kitchen . ”
All the participants had to do was simply write down the number of statements that were true for them .
The value of this method is that participants don ’ t have to directly say , “ I am a vegetarian , ” or , “ I ’ m a dog owner ” — they only have to acknowledge the number of statements that apply to them . That alone should zero out any embarrassment or hesitance to admit to a particular item .
That ’ s important because the other 1,000 or so participants saw the exact same list — but with one statement added : “ I believe in God . ”
By comparing the responses between the two groups , Gervais and Najle could then estimate how many people don ’ t believe in God . ( Because both groups of 1,000 poll takers should , in theory , have the same number of vegetarians , dog owners , and so on in each group , any increases in the number of agreed-to statements from the first group to the second should be reflective of the number of people who don ’ t believe in God . )
One thing is clear from the results : Much more than 10 or 11 percent of the country ( as assessed in Gallup and Pew polling ) does not believe in God . “ We can say with a 99 percent probability that it ’ s higher than [ 11 percent ] , ” said Gervais .
His best estimate : Around 26 percent of Americans don ’ t believe in God . “ According to our samples , about 1 in 3 atheists in our country do n't feel comfortable disclosing their lack of belief , ” Najle explains in an email .
Gervais admits this method isn ’ t perfect , and yields an answer with a wide margin of error . ( On the other end of the margin of error , around 35 percent of Americans don ’ t believe in God . ) But the most fundamental question he and Najle are asking here is do polling firms like Gallup and Pew undercount atheists ? And it seems the answer is yes .
Gervais and Najle also concurrently replicated the study with a second sample of 2,000 participants , and got similar results . ( In this second sample , they framed the atheism question in the negative — “ I do not believe in God ” — which yielded a slightly lower number of atheists . This could be because people are a bit more anxious to respond to such a definite phrase as , “ No , I do not believe in God . ” )
Could this really be true ? A few grains of salt .
I ran Gervais and Najle ’ s conclusion by Greg Smith , who directs Pew ’ s polling efforts on religion . He ’ s not yet ready to buy it .
“ I would be very reluctant to conclude that phone surveys like ours are underestimating the share the public who are atheists to that kind of magnitude , ” he says .
For one , Smith says , Pew has asked questions on religion both on the phone and online and didn ’ t see much of a difference . You ’ d expect if people were unwilling to say that they ’ re atheists over the phone to a stranger , they ’ d be slightly more likely to input it into a computer . ( Though Pew ’ s online questioning still has participants directly answer the question , instead of asking people to merely list the numbers of items they agree with . Even online , people might be uneasy answering the question . )
Also , Smith points out a weird quirk in Gervais ’ s data .
In one of the trials , instead of adding the “ I don ’ t believe in God ” measure to the list , the survey added a nonsense phrase : “ I do not believe that 2 + 2 is less than 13. ” And 34 percent of their participants agreed . Bizarre indeed . The researchers ’ explanation ? “ It may reflect any combination of genuine innumeracy [ lack of math skills ] , incomprehension of an oddly phrased item , participant inattentiveness or jesting , sampling error , or a genuine flaw in the ... technique , ” Gervais and Najle write in the paper .
But they still think their measure is valid . When they limited the sample to people who were self-professed atheists ( as measured in a separate question ) , 100 percent said they didn ’ t believe in God , which is correct . “ It is unlikely that a genuinely invalid method would track self-reported atheism this precisely , ” they write .
Still , more research is needed . “ In time , we 'll hopefully be able to refine our methods and find other indirect measurement techniques , ” Gervais says . ( Overall , kudos to Gervais and Najle for being forthright about their curious finding . In the past , psychologists have had incentives to avoid printing this type of contradictory finding in their papers . )
For a lot of us , belief in God is not a binary
There ’ s something else to consider here : Our experience with religion can ’ t really be boiled down to one question — “ Do you believe in God ? ”
Many of us have a complicated relationship with religion . There are plenty of people celebrating Easter and Passover this week not because they have devout faith , but because it ’ s a cultural tradition they cherish and identify with .
Pew regularly finds data that supports this multifaceted view . When people in their surveys say , “ I believe in God , ” Pew will often ask a follow-up question : “ How certain are you ? ” And they find that not everyone is so sure .
About a quarter of the US population say they believe in God but are less than absolutely certain of it , Smith says .
The lesson : Belief in God doesn ’ t exist as a binary . Not everyone is certain about what they feel ; many people have shades of gray . “ There are gradations of belief , ” Smith says . “ It ’ s not that it ’ s wrong to ask ‘ yes or no , ’ but it ’ s not the whole story . ”
And Gervais admits : This measure doesn ’ t capture the complex and contradictory feelings many people have about religion . ( And Najle adds that these data “ are limited to the U.S. and should not be generalized beyond that . ” )
But in the data , they also find some small evidence that the stigma around atheism is changing . When they break the numbers down by demographics , they find that baby boomer and millennials report similar levels of disbelief ( even though traditional polling shows baby boomers are more likely to believe in god ) . This could be because younger people feel less anxious about their atheism .
“ It could be underlying belief levels haven ’ t changed , ” Gervais says , comparing the generations , “ but norms have . ”","Here’s a simple question: How many Americans don’t believe in God?

Pew and Gallup — two of the most reputable polling firms in America — both come to a similar figure. About 10 percent of Americans say they do not believe in God, and this figure has been slowly creeping up over the decades.

So when a stranger conducting a poll calls and asks the question, it may be uncomfortable for many to answer truthfully.

Gervais and Najle recently conducted a new analysis on the prevalence of atheists in America. And they conclude the number of people who do not believe in God may be even double that counted by these polling firms.

“There’s a lot of atheists in the closet,” Gervais says. “And ... if they knew there are lots of people just like them out there, that could potentially promote more tolerance.”

People are embarrassed to tell strangers they don’t believe in God

Currently, if you’re seeking data to answer the question, “How many Americans do not believe in God?” you have two main sources.

First is the Pew Research Center. Most recently, Pew found that around 3 percent of Americans say they are atheists. It also found that a larger group — around 9 percent — say they do not believe in God or a universal spirit. (Which goes to show that you may not believe in God but could still be uncomfortable calling yourself an atheist — because that term implies a strong personal identity and an outright rejection of religious rituals.) Gallup also regularly asks the question point blank — “Do you believe in God?” The last time it asked, in 2016, 10 percent of respondents said no.

Gervais’s experience studying the stigma around atheism the world over made him suspect these numbers are wrong.

Study after study has shown that most people (even other atheists) believe atheists are less moral. “We’ll give participants a little vignette, a story about someone doing something immoral, and probe their intuition about who they think the perpetrator was,” Gervais says. “And time and time again, people intuitively assume whoever is out there doing immoral stuff doesn’t believe in God.”

So it would make sense that when Pew or Gallup calls, people who don’t believe in God may be reluctant to say so. “We shouldn’t expect people to give a stranger over the phone an honest answer to that question,” Gervais says.

So recently, Gervais and Najle designed a test to find these “closet atheists.” Their results were recently published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science.

How to find “closet atheists”

So if you can’t ask people outright whether they’re atheist and get an honest response, how do you go about finding them?

Gervais and Najle set up a very subtle test. They sent a nationally representative poll to 2,000 Americans, who were randomly assigned to two conditions.

The first condition asked participants to read through a bunch of statements like, “I am a vegetarian,” “I own a dog,” and, “I have a dishwasher in my kitchen.”

All the participants had to do was simply write down the number of statements that were true for them.

The value of this method is that participants don’t have to directly say, “I am a vegetarian,” or, “I’m a dog owner” — they only have to acknowledge the number of statements that apply to them. That alone should zero out any embarrassment or hesitance to admit to a particular item.

That’s important because the other 1,000 or so participants saw the exact same list — but with one statement added: “I believe in God.”

By comparing the responses between the two groups, Gervais and Najle could then estimate how many people don’t believe in God. (Because both groups of 1,000 poll takers should, in theory, have the same number of vegetarians, dog owners, and so on in each group, any increases in the number of agreed-to statements from the first group to the second should be reflective of the number of people who don’t believe in God.)

One thing is clear from the results: Much more than 10 or 11 percent of the country (as assessed in Gallup and Pew polling) does not believe in God. “We can say with a 99 percent probability that it’s higher than [11 percent],” said Gervais.

His best estimate: Around 26 percent of Americans don’t believe in God. “According to our samples, about 1 in 3 atheists in our country don't feel comfortable disclosing their lack of belief,” Najle explains in an email.

Gervais admits this method isn’t perfect, and yields an answer with a wide margin of error. (On the other end of the margin of error, around 35 percent of Americans don’t believe in God.) But the most fundamental question he and Najle are asking here is do polling firms like Gallup and Pew undercount atheists? And it seems the answer is yes.

Gervais and Najle also concurrently replicated the study with a second sample of 2,000 participants, and got similar results. (In this second sample, they framed the atheism question in the negative — “I do not believe in God” — which yielded a slightly lower number of atheists. This could be because people are a bit more anxious to respond to such a definite phrase as, “No, I do not believe in God.”)

Could this really be true? A few grains of salt.

I ran Gervais and Najle’s conclusion by Greg Smith, who directs Pew’s polling efforts on religion. He’s not yet ready to buy it.

“I would be very reluctant to conclude that phone surveys like ours are underestimating the share the public who are atheists to that kind of magnitude,” he says.

For one, Smith says, Pew has asked questions on religion both on the phone and online and didn’t see much of a difference. You’d expect if people were unwilling to say that they’re atheists over the phone to a stranger, they’d be slightly more likely to input it into a computer. (Though Pew’s online questioning still has participants directly answer the question, instead of asking people to merely list the numbers of items they agree with. Even online, people might be uneasy answering the question.)

Also, Smith points out a weird quirk in Gervais’s data.

In one of the trials, instead of adding the “I don’t believe in God” measure to the list, the survey added a nonsense phrase: “I do not believe that 2 + 2 is less than 13.” And 34 percent of their participants agreed. Bizarre indeed. The researchers’ explanation? “It may reflect any combination of genuine innumeracy [lack of math skills], incomprehension of an oddly phrased item, participant inattentiveness or jesting, sampling error, or a genuine flaw in the ... technique,” Gervais and Najle write in the paper.

But they still think their measure is valid. When they limited the sample to people who were self-professed atheists (as measured in a separate question), 100 percent said they didn’t believe in God, which is correct. “It is unlikely that a genuinely invalid method would track self-reported atheism this precisely,” they write.

Still, more research is needed. “In time, we'll hopefully be able to refine our methods and find other indirect measurement techniques,” Gervais says. (Overall, kudos to Gervais and Najle for being forthright about their curious finding. In the past, psychologists have had incentives to avoid printing this type of contradictory finding in their papers.)

For a lot of us, belief in God is not a binary

There’s something else to consider here: Our experience with religion can’t really be boiled down to one question — “Do you believe in God?”

Many of us have a complicated relationship with religion. There are plenty of people celebrating Easter and Passover this week not because they have devout faith, but because it’s a cultural tradition they cherish and identify with.

Pew regularly finds data that supports this multifaceted view. When people in their surveys say, “I believe in God,” Pew will often ask a follow-up question: “How certain are you?” And they find that not everyone is so sure.

About a quarter of the US population say they believe in God but are less than absolutely certain of it, Smith says.

The lesson: Belief in God doesn’t exist as a binary. Not everyone is certain about what they feel; many people have shades of gray. “There are gradations of belief,” Smith says. “It’s not that it’s wrong to ask ‘yes or no,’ but it’s not the whole story.”

And Gervais admits: This measure doesn’t capture the complex and contradictory feelings many people have about religion. (And Najle adds that these data “are limited to the U.S. and should not be generalized beyond that.”)

But in the data, they also find some small evidence that the stigma around atheism is changing. When they break the numbers down by demographics, they find that baby boomer and millennials report similar levels of disbelief (even though traditional polling shows baby boomers are more likely to believe in god). This could be because younger people feel less anxious about their atheism.

“It could be underlying belief levels haven’t changed,” Gervais says, comparing the generations, “but norms have.”",www.vox.com,left,b5hbxKhB4QASkurI

The Church said in a statement that the General Synod , its legislative body , voted on Tuesday to issue an official apology and commission an outside expert to prepare a report on racism , race and ethnicity in the church .
Speaking at the synod , the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby , who is the church 's most senior bishop , said there was `` no doubt '' that the Church of England was still `` deeply institutionally racist '' .

The Windrush generation

The statement from the church specifically mentions the so-called Windrush generation , the first large group of Caribbean migrants to arrive in the United Kingdom after World War II.

They were invited by the UK government to come and help rebuild Britain after the devastation of the war. Hundreds of thousands of people came from former British colonies. Until a new immigration law came into force in 1973, Commonwealth citizens and their children had the automatic right to live and work in the UK.

When successive British governments adopted a tougher approach to illegal immigration in recent years, descendants of these first immigrants found themselves under scrutiny.

The government adopted new laws in 2012 that require employers, landlords and health service providers to demand evidence of legal immigration status.

Some descendants of the Windrush generation have struggled to prove their status, because they don't have these required documents. As a consequence, some lost their jobs, others were evicted from their homes, and a few were reported to have been threatened with deportation.

The government was forced to apologize -- repeatedly -- for their treatment of the Windrush generation and their descendants. Now, the Church of England has followed.

For a time he enjoyed the celebrity of heroism and hob-knobbing with Hollywood. He met and married a beautiful woman named Cynthia Applewhite and life was good. But when all the glitz and glamour faded and reality set in, reoccurring nightmares of war and memories of Louie’s torture by his enemies tormented him.

To escape these horrors, Louie turned to alcohol. Pent-up anger overcame him.

His wife who genuinely loved him felt she had no choice but to divorce him. The man who had endured horrific physical and mental abuse, and emerged unbroken from the ravages of war, had succumbed to an enemy that would not let go -- himself.

When my father invited people to turn their lives over to Jesus Christ, she responded by accepting Him as her Lord and Savior. That night Cynthia informed Louie that because of this decision she had made, she would not divorce him.

Last week , eight attacks — including four in just 48 hours — sent a familiar shock wave rippling through the Jewish community . Then on Saturday came the horrific stabbing in Monsey , New York . The poison of Jew-hatred is spreading .
Like many of you , I ’ m thinking , “ Not this subject again. ” How many columns can be devoted to it ? I ’ ve read them . I ’ ve written them . It ’ s exhausting , and it ’ s dreary . Jews are being beaten up , anti-Semitism flows some years and ebbs in others . So what ?
Mayor Bill de Blasio released his usual by-the-numbers statement . “ Hate doesn ’ t have a home in our city , ” he tweeted . But hate does have a home here , and it has found it while Hizzoner has mostly looked away .
The mayor added : “ In light of recent anti-Semitic attacks , the NYPD will increase their presence in Borough Park , Crown Heights and Williamsburg. ” But the recent attacks have spread to Midtown Manhattan and Gravesend , Brooklyn . The problem has gotten worse while inaction paralyzed the mayor .
I first wrote about the uptick in May . The reason the city ’ s liberal political class was ignoring it , I ­argued , is that the criminals don ’ t fit their picture of Evil Bigots . They aren ’ t , for the most part , MAGA hat-wearing white guys with tiki torches . In fact , many of the attackers are people of color , as investigative reporting by Tablet ’ s Armin Rosen and others has shown .
Imagine if they were white ­nationalists . How much faster would the mayor and other city leaders have taken action ?
“ A lot of folks were told it was unacceptable to be anti-Semitic , ” de Blasio said in May . “ It was ­unacceptable to be racist , and now they ’ re getting more permission. ” The message was subtle but unmistakable : De Blasio was trying to pin the attacks in bright-blue New York on President Trump .
see also De Blasio 's whitewashing on anti-Semitism Here ’ s what ’ s been happening in New York City over the ...
Hizzoner didn ’ t surrender the fantasy for some time . In June , he said : “ I want to be very , very clear , the violent threat , the threat that is ideological , is very much from the right . ”
He left unclear how the Big ­Apple had come to be populated by ideological far-right types beating up on Jews . His comments ­underscored his inability to truly counter the type of street-level ­anti-Semitism spreading through the city .
Will he face the facts now ? Or will Jews need to actually die , not just be pummeled , for our leaders to grasp the threat ?
“ Anti-Semitism is an attack on the values of our city — and we will confront it head-on , ” de Blasio tweeted after this latest round of violence against Jews in the city . He has to stop beating around the bush . These attacks aren ’ t an ­attack on “ our values. ” They ’ re attacks on visibly Jewish people .
Even Sunday , after the Monsey stabbings , he blamed Trump and “ Washington ” for creating “ an atmosphere of hate . ”
De Blasio needs to stop trying to find a “ them ” to be the opposite of his “ us. ” His juvenile obsession with having the right adversaries allows anti-Semitism to flourish .
I used to write about Europeans and their apathetic attitudes ­toward the Jew-hatred around them . Synagogues torched , Jews beaten — just another day on the Continent .
But now the demon is here , in America . Worse , it ’ s stalking Jews with increasing regularity in New York City , my city , home to the largest Jewish population outside Israel . Hizzoner ’ s vague universalist rhetoric obscures this raw reality .

It ’ s complicit .","Anti-Semitic attacks continue to shake our city and state. Last week, eight attacks — including four in just 48 hours — sent a familiar shock wave rippling through the Jewish community. Then on Saturday came the horrific stabbing in Monsey, New York. The poison of Jew-hatred is spreading.

Like many of you, I’m thinking, “Not this subject again.” How many columns can be devoted to it? I’ve read them. I’ve written them. It’s exhausting, and it’s dreary. Jews are being beaten up, anti-Semitism flows some years and ebbs in others. So what?

But it matters — gravely.

Mayor Bill de Blasio released his usual by-the-numbers statement. “Hate doesn’t have a home in our city,” he tweeted. But hate does have a home here, and it has found it while Hizzoner has mostly looked away.

The mayor added: “In light of recent anti-Semitic attacks, the NYPD will increase their presence in Borough Park, Crown Heights and Williamsburg.” But the recent attacks have spread to Midtown Manhattan and Gravesend, Brooklyn. The problem has gotten worse while inaction paralyzed the mayor.

I first wrote about the uptick in May. The reason the city’s liberal political class was ignoring it, I ­argued, is that the criminals don’t fit their picture of Evil Bigots. They aren’t, for the most part, MAGA hat-wearing white guys with tiki torches. In fact, many of the attackers are people of color, as investigative reporting by Tablet’s Armin Rosen and others has shown.

Imagine if they were white ­nationalists. How much faster would the mayor and other city leaders have taken action?

“A lot of folks were told it was unacceptable to be anti-Semitic,” de Blasio said in May. “It was ­unacceptable to be racist, and now they’re getting more permission.” The message was subtle but unmistakable: De Blasio was trying to pin the attacks in bright-blue New York on President Trump.

Hizzoner didn’t surrender the fantasy for some time. In June, he said: “I want to be very, very clear, the violent threat, the threat that is ideological, is very much from the right.”

He left unclear how the Big ­Apple had come to be populated by ideological far-right types beating up on Jews. His comments ­underscored his inability to truly counter the type of street-level ­anti-Semitism spreading through the city.

Will he face the facts now? Or will Jews need to actually die, not just be pummeled, for our leaders to grasp the threat?

“Anti-Semitism is an attack on the values of our city — and we will confront it head-on,” de Blasio tweeted after this latest round of violence against Jews in the city. He has to stop beating around the bush. These attacks aren’t an ­attack on “our values.” They’re attacks on visibly Jewish people.

Even Sunday, after the Monsey stabbings, he blamed Trump and “Washington” for creating “an atmosphere of hate.”

De Blasio needs to stop trying to find a “them” to be the opposite of his “us.” His juvenile obsession with having the right adversaries allows anti-Semitism to flourish.

I used to write about Europeans and their apathetic attitudes ­toward the Jew-hatred around them. Synagogues torched, Jews beaten — just another day on the Continent.

But now the demon is here, in America. Worse, it’s stalking Jews with increasing regularity in New York City, my city, home to the largest Jewish population outside Israel. Hizzoner’s vague universalist rhetoric obscures this raw reality.

And it isn’t just his ideological blinders. The mayor has also helped create an anti-police ­atmosphere, in which the vigilant presence of officers is considered a bad thing. At an anti-police rally last month, there were signs calling for violence against the NYPD.

De Blasio’s response? He insinuated that the idea that there’s anti-police sentiment in our city is, yes, another right-wing plot.

In 2020, I don’t want to read ­another column like this one. All Jews want is to live our lives in safety. To ensure that, the mayor will have to stop using the violence against us to fight his invisible political foes.

De Blasio’s ideology has led to apathy, which, in turn, has resulted in injured Jews in our city. It’s time for his administration to take serious action, starting by flooding hot-spot neighborhoods with ­police officers empowered to act.

A striking display of compassion from the brother of a murder victim to his killer was, to some, a heart-wrenching example of empathy. But to others, it was a painful example of African Americans forced to respond to acts of violence with understanding, writes Barrett Holmes Pitner.

Their hug lasted nearly a minute as those in the courtroom openly wept from this stunning show of compassion.

Some seasoned court commentators described it as the most powerful moment they had ever seen in a courtroom. And it generated headlines all around the world.

After Guyger and Brandt Jean's embrace, Judge Tammy Kemp, who is black, left her judge's bench and also embraced Guyger. Kemp gave Guyger a Bible and the two of them prayed together before Guyger was led away from the courtroom.

In most situations, compassion and empathy do not prompt heated debates, but in the US, the actions of Brandt Jean and Judge Kemp have rekindled a complex conversation about race and inequality.

American culture has historically depicted slave rebellions as unwarranted acts of black aggression against white Americans, and as the black community has pursued freedom and equality there has always been a profound debate about the level of anger black America can constructively express towards white America.

Titans of the black intelligentsia have long debated various approaches for black equality and the best ways to channel and express black anger. During the civil rights struggle of the 1960s, the conflicting philosophies of Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X highlighted this tension.

When looking at the facts of the case, there are ample reasons for the black community to be angry.

On 6 September, 2018, Guyger returned home to her apartment complex after finishing work as a Dallas police officer.

Essentially, Miller believed that Guyger should not be charged with murder because she was not paying attention when she murdered Jean.

According to Hansford, America's cultural stifling and stigmatising of black anger has made forgiveness one of the few recourses for the black community. The alleged illegitimacy of African American anger has many American manifestations - notably the ""Angry Black Woman"" and ""dangerous"" black men - and America has long mythologized the alleged benefit of the black community forgiving white America.

Brandt Jean's decision to forgive Guyger remains a personal decision, but Judge Kemp's decision forces America to contend with the tragic subjectivity of our justice system.

Unless Judge Kemp normally embraces, prays, and gifts a Bible to those she sends to prison, America must ask why Guyger warranted this degree of compassion and others did not. Does this undermine Kemp's impartiality?

""What is justice in this case? If you're going to bust into someone's house and shoot them dead, and then get five years in prison and a hug from the judge. Are you okay with that? And why don't similar sentences and shows of compassion happen more often?"" says Hansford.

For many members of the black community, who also struggle to express their anger at America's systemic oppression, this trial represents one of many examples of how precarious and under threat black life has always been in America. Compassion might feel right in the moment, but the debate still rages as to whether it brings America closer to a semblance of racial equality.

The roots of the present-day anti-Semitic motif go through the Middle Ages and all the way back to antiquity .
Anti-Semitism has many exceptional qualities . Unlike most forms of racism , it is a conspiracy theory . Like all conspiracy theories , it is a search for the Devil , or for the Devil ’ s agents on earth . They are imagined not as an underclass to be exploited and despised but as a preternaturally powerful elite that enslaves and destroys humankind . The anti-Semite “ punches up ” at the Jews who close the road to deliverance from oppression .
Despite its lethality , anti-Semitism is the form of racism most often erased , excused , and even encouraged by people who identify as “ antiracist. ” One explanation for this phenomenon , increasingly dangerous as harassment , vandalism , and violence against Jews rise across the West , is the failure of Holocaust education to emphasize the importance of conspiracism in Nazi ideology . For their part , soi-disant American antiracists render Jews “ white ” and “ privileged ” through a limited lens of race and power , taking an approach that is an allotrope of anti-Semitism and disqualifies Jews from concern .
So when U.S. representatives Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar resolved to visit Israel in August to showcase to the world its peculiar evil , and it emerged that Miftah , the Palestinian non-governmental organization co-sponsoring their trip , had published on its website that Jews bake Christian blood into their matzoh , most major media ignored it . For them the story was the erosion of liberal democracy by the tag team of Trump and Netanyahu , who had barred entry to the congresswomen . There is little indication that the blood libel stirred concern on the left where just a month earlier “ Never again ” was intoned relentlessly about Trump ’ s “ concentration camps ” at the border .
The omission is striking . Blood libel is the purest expression of Jew-hatred there is . To overlook it is not just to miss a spectacular instance of bigotry ; it is to be oblivious to anti-Semitism . The reason the blood libel has pride of place in the persecution of Jews is that it exemplifies anti-Semitism ’ s worst exceptional quality . Most types of racism define their victims as an “ other ” in relation to the group and regard them as less than human . Anti-Semitism , like all conspiracy theories , marks its target as an “ other ” in relation to humanity and regards the target as anti-human .
This dynamic has been present since the beginning of Western civilization . In his book Europe ’ s Inner Demons , the historian Norman Cohn demonstrates that by the second century a popular “ fantasy ” had emerged that civilization was threatened by a secret society “ addicted to practices which were felt to be wholly abominable. ” Of course , xenophobia has always assumed the existence of in-groups and out-groups . Generally , out-groups are opposed to in-groups through stereotypes that suggest the inferiority of the former . Ancient Greeks , for example , regarded various foreign peoples as childlike babblers . Romans thought their Jewish subjects smelled bad — a prejudice that survived in Europe long after the Empire fell .
Conspiracist xenophobia uses stereotypes that suggest much more — a set of behaviors , terrible and extranormal , of which only anti-human conspirators could be capable . These include cannibalism , atrocious sexual practices such as incest and pedophilia , and the sexualized worship of monstrous gods . Rituals are performed in clandestine ceremonies . At the center there is often a child , typically a young boy , murdered and consumed for purposes of black magic .
Ritual murder was a “ stock charge ” in the ancient world . Dio Cassius accused three separate cabals — the Cataline conspirators and Egyptians and Alexandrian Jews in revolt against Rome — of sacrificing a boy and eating his entrails to inaugurate their plots for power . The Greek grammarian Apion applied the canard against all Jews , although in that era it was Christians who suffered the most as a result of stereotypes that reduced some people to the status of the anti-human . In 177 the Romans martyred believers near present-day Lyons , torturing their pagan slaves into corroborating familiar rumors — that their Christian masters were an incest cult who sacrificed and devoured children .
After Christianity was established as the state religion of the Roman Empire in the fourth century , those lurid fantasies simmered underground for the better part of a millennium . Meanwhile , Christians refined their theology of combat between the forces of good and the forces of evil : between God and Satan , between Christ and Antichrist , and between the righteous people and the demonic people who served as their agents on earth . In that morally supercharged xenophobia , Satan was attached to groups set apart as the “ other. ” The scope of the anti-human conspiracy became cosmic .
While Christian heretics and women thought to be witches would suffer unimaginably from this association , the Jews were destined to reap the worst of it in the form of the Holocaust . ( The word alludes , with the grimmest irony , to a “ burnt offering. ” ) Various passages of the New Testament were read as confirmation of the idea of Jewish guilt for killing Christ and of Jewish communion with the Devil .
In the medieval mind , the association between Jews and the Devil grew . Shortly before Easter in 1144 , a young boy named William was found dead in the sallow grass of a heath near the lively center of Norwich , England . His body , stripped naked save for a jacket and shoes , showed signs of violence . He had been gagged with a piece of wood . Despairing relatives accused local Jews of the crime , but the charge didn ’ t take . Five years later , a Benedictine monk hoping to establish a local cult spun the rumors into a tale of ritual murder .
The myth of little William spread , partly because it met a subterranean need we all share : to explain and dramatize terrible events that happen for mysterious or mundane reasons . Over the next hundred years , copycat claims arose throughout Europe . Yet the mature blood accusation — that Jews ritually murder Christians to harvest their blood for Passover — wouldn ’ t become standard until the 14th century . The thinking about Jews and blood needed to develop before it might make emotional sense .
Christians in the Middle Ages regarded Jews as sorcerers , allied with demons . Little distinction was made between magic and medicine . When the charges of ritual murder were spreading , Jews were widely thought to suffer from peculiar maladies , many of which caused blood loss : hemorrhages , hemorrhoids , quinsy , scrofula , skin diseases , purulent sores ; Jewish men were said to menstruate along with women , and Jewish babies to be born with one hand fixed to their foreheads , requiring surgery to detach . The recipes of medieval magic often focused on sickness and health , and sometimes they called for blood or body parts . Jews were assumed to need non-Jewish blood to be well . Christian life and Jewish life were literally held to be inversely related .
The effect of such fantasies was demonstrated in 1475 when a little boy named Simon went missing in Trent . Local Jews were seized and tortured into confessing that they ritually slaughtered him and drained his blood . Many were burned alive . Blood had become the preferred motif for expressing what medieval Christians conceived of as a parasitical Jewish project to destroy their civilization . While the Nazi movement thought itself superior to Christianity , it imported wholesale the idea of the Jews as the Devil ’ s agents , coupled to the anti-human stereotype that was embodied by the medieval blood libel . Rumors of blood libel and incidents related to it recurred in Europe until even after the Nazi surrender .
In the blood-libel piece posted on the Miftah site in 2013 , President Obama was said to have held an imprudent Passover seder at the White House , where he enjoyed “ Jewish cuisine ” that was likely prepared with the blood of Christians . Under intense criticism , Miftah eventually retracted and apologized , but the medieval pitch of the piece was so true that I browsed their website for similar material and quickly found an article by Bouthaina Shaaban , who is now Bashar Assad ’ s media adviser . There Shaaban writes that Israel stole “ Ukrainian children in order to harvest their organs. ” The blood libel was transferred to the Arab world by Christian missionaries , surfacing in a famous case at Damascus in 1840 . Today it is a recurring feature of Arab and Muslim anti-Semitism .
It would be a mistake to think that the phenomenon as it exists today is exclusively a Middle Eastern vice . As in the ancient world , the blood libel and other canards about the anti-human can be applied to any enemy . In the Pizzagate affair , far-right opponents of the Hillary Clinton campaign spread the rumor that a pizzeria in Washington , D.C. , was a hub for human trafficking , child sex , and Satanic ritual abuse by high-ranking members of the Democratic party . The premises were shot up by a conspiracy theorist with an AR-15 .
Often , of course , the targets in the present day , as in the Middle Ages , are Jewish . Alex Jones raves that CNN correspondent Brian Stelter is a “ literal demon spawn ” who is “ drunk on our children ’ s blood. ” Louis Farrakhan preaches that “ pedophilia and sexual perversion institutionalized in Hollywood . . . can be traced to Talmudic principles and . . . Satanic influence under the name of Jew . ”
It would also be a mistake to think that anti-Semitism is confined to the political Right . Karl Marx , in 1847 , repeated the ancient calumny that “ Christians really did slaughter human beings and eat and drink human flesh at Communion. ” The Second Intifada and the Arab–Israeli impasse retrained focus on the Jews . In 2001 journalist Chris Hedges wrote in Harper ’ s that Israeli soldiers “ entice children like mice into a trap and murder them for sport. ” On Holocaust Memorial Day in 2003 , The Independent ran a political cartoon that showed Ariel Sharon eating the head of a Palestinian baby .

We can not afford double standards . In Poland in the aftermath of the Holocaust , 42 Jewish residents of Kielce were murdered by their neighbors acting on rumors that Jews had kidnapped a young boy .

A changing America, that’s the subject of this evening’s “Talking Points Memo”.

Interesting poll from the Associated Press about immigration. When asked do you favor or oppose providing a legal way for illegal immigrants already in the U.S.A. to stay in the country legally: 50 percent favor, 48 percent oppose. When asked do you favor or oppose providing a way for immigrants who live in the U.S.A illegally but whose children are U.S. citizens or permanent residents to say legally: 57 percent favor; 40 percent oppose. The poll was taken among American by adults.

Another finding: three-quarters of Republicans say they would prefer a candidate who would undo President Obama’s executive actions on immigration. So there is a big split between Democrats and Republicans. But the majority, according to the A.P. poll, would consider policies that are beneficial to illegal aliens. That’s a change.

On the religious front: another poll very provocative. According to a Pew Research study of 35,000 American adults Christianity is on the decline. 2007: 78.4 percent of Americans describe themselves as Christian. Last year 2014 that number drops to it 70.6 percent. Among the non- Christian faiths, Jewish Americans up slightly; Muslims up half a percentage point to just under one percent of the population.

However the biggest growing segment of religion, those who reject it – – atheists, agnostic, nothing, up 50 percent to 22.8 percent of the population now. So what’s happening?

There is no question that people of faith are being marginalized by a secular media and pernicious entertainment. The rap industry for example often glorifies depraved behavior and that sinks into the minds of some young people, the group that is most likely to reject religion. Also many movies and TV shows promote non traditional values.

Truth is if you are a person of faith the media generally thinks you are a loon. The prevailing wisdom especially among young Americans is whatever is good for me is good, period. The overall good be damned — pardon the pun.

We see that reflected in the attitude on drugs. There is a strong move to legalize them and decriminalize even the sale of poisons like heroin and cocaine. Any student of history knows that when a nation turns inward toward the pursuit of individual gratification, the country is in trouble. Rome — the best example. The citizens there ultimately rejected sacrificing for their republican — for their republic, I should say — and the empire collapsed.

“Talking Points” believes the same thing is happening in America today. But it can be fixed if the electorate finally wakes up. That is a big if. The main reason Christianity is on the decline is poor leadership and corruption within the Catholic Church. The priest scandal devastated the Catholic landscape in America.

Although the founding fathers wanted freedom of religion, they did not want a secular nation. That’s clear in the writings of Jefferson and Madison. The founders believing that a strong moral code put forth by religion protects people from harm and avarice.

On the immigration front chaos is simply overwhelming. Americans remain essentially a fair people. They know the system is broken. And they know our leaders are playing politics with people’s lives. There is a fair way to deal with illegal immigration and Americans want that put into place.

Adding it all up, there is no question the country is changing for the worse. And that’s why the upcoming election is, perhaps, the most important presidential vote in our lifetime.

And that’s the memo.",www.breitbart.com,right,UYmkEDmKKRYUgkCe

Police presence was increased at places of worship across New York City on Tuesday after a man burst into a Brooklyn synagogue yelling ""Kill the Jews!"" and stabbing a rabbinical student, police said.

The suspect was fatally shot by a police officer in a tense standoff caught on amateur video.

""This was an isolated incident that appears to involve an individual known to the police department, who has a history of being emotionally disturbed,"" NYPD spokesman John Miller said. ""That said, given the concern that the news of the story might bring to other houses of worship in the city... you will see some enhanced coverage in terms of police presence.""

A witness recorded parts of the police standoff on a cellphone. The chilling video shows Calvin Peters, 49, refusing an officer's repeated order to ""drop the ------- knife."" Seconds later one gunshot is heard. Police said no other shots were fired.

Levi Rosenblat, 22, was hospitalized in stable condition with a wound from a 9-inch knife with a 4.5-inch blade, police said.

Israel Gottdenger, 26, told The New York Post he entered the building with Peters.

""It's a very public building and people of all kinds are always walking in, white, black, everyone,"" Gottdenger said. But soon ""he was just going crazy. He said 'I want to sit down, I want to get a Bible, who wants to die tonight,' he kept changing his words. He was either really high on drugs or (emotionally disturbed).""

Rabbi Motti Seligson of Chabad-Lubavitch Hasidic world headquarters in Crown Heights described police as ""heroic."" According to witnesses, Peters was heard saying repeatedly ""Kill the Jews,"" said Chaim Landa, a spokeswoman for Chabad-Lubavitch. Several other people immediately intervened, Landa said.

After the stabbing, witness flagged down a patrol officer, who confronted Peters and told him to put the knife down. More officers soon responded. The video picks up with the officers aiming guns at the man.

Peters several times chides the officers: ""You gonna shoot me?!"" The officer responds, ""If you don't drop the knife I will.""

Peters puts down the knife, then picks it back up as the officer shouts ""Stay the ---- away from the knife now!""

The man is seen pacing with the knife, but the actual shooting is not seen on the video recorded on a witness's phone. James O'Neil, NYPD's chief of department, said Peters ""advanced on the officer"" and was shot once in the torso.

The man was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead. Peters had a history of mental illness and had been arrested 19 times since 1982, most recently in 2006 for drugs, police said. He had also been to the Chabad-Lubavitch before, which is open to the public at all hours.

religion_and_faith,Pew Research Center,1,https://www.pewforum.org/2019/10/17/in-u-s-decline-of-christianity-continues-at-rapid-pace/,"In U.S., Decline of Christianity Continues at Rapid Pace",2019-10-17,,"The religious landscape of the United States continues to change at a rapid clip . In ███ telephone surveys conducted in 2018 and 2019 , 65 % of American adults describe themselves as Christians when asked about their religion , down 12 percentage points over the past decade . Meanwhile , the religiously unaffiliated share of the population , consisting of people who describe their religious identity as atheist , agnostic or “ nothing in particular , ” now stands at 26 % , up from 17 % in 2009 .
Both Protestantism and Catholicism are experiencing losses of population share . Currently , 43 % of U.S. adults identify with Protestantism , down from 51 % in 2009 . And one-in-five adults ( 20 % ) are Catholic , down from 23 % in 2009 . Meanwhile , all subsets of the religiously unaffiliated population – a group also known as religious “ nones ” – have seen their numbers swell . Self-described atheists now account for 4 % of U.S. adults , up modestly but significantly from 2 % in 2009 ; agnostics make up 5 % of U.S. adults , up from 3 % a decade ago ; and 17 % of Americans now describe their religion as “ nothing in particular , ” up from 12 % in 2009 . Members of non-Christian religions also have grown modestly as a share of the adult population .
These are among the key findings of a new analysis of trends in the religious composition and churchgoing habits of the American public , based on recent ███ random-digit-dial ( RDD ) political polling on the telephone . The data shows that the trend toward religious disaffiliation documented in the Center ’ s 2007 and 2014 Religious Landscape Studies , and before that in major national studies like the General Social Survey ( GSS ) , has continued apace .
███ ’ s 2007 and 2014 Religious Landscape Studies were huge national RDD surveys , each of which included interviews with more than 35,000 respondents who were asked dozens of detailed questions about their religious identities , beliefs and practices . The Center has not yet conducted a third such study , and when the Landscape Study is repeated , it is likely to use new methods that may prevent it from being directly comparable to the previous studies ; growing challenges to conducting national surveys by telephone have led the Center to rely increasingly on self-administered surveys conducted online .
But while no new Religious Landscape Study is available or in the immediate offing , the Center has collected five additional years of data ( since the 2014 Landscape Study ) from RDD political polls ( see detailed tables ) . The samples from these political polls are not as large as the Landscape Studies ( even when all of the political polls conducted in a year are combined ) , but together , 88 surveys from 2009 to 2019 included interviews with 168,890 Americans .
These surveys do not include nearly as many questions about religion as the Landscape Studies do . However , as part of the demographic battery of questions that ask respondents about their age , race , educational attainment and other background characteristics , each of these political polls also include one basic question about religious identity – “ What is your present religion , if any ? Are you Protestant , Roman Catholic , Mormon , Orthodox such as Greek or Russian Orthodox , Jewish , Muslim , Buddhist , Hindu , atheist , agnostic , something else , or nothing in particular ? ”
Additionally , most of these political polls include a question about religious attendance – “ Aside from weddings and funerals , how often do you attend religious services ? More than once a week , once a week , once or twice a month , a few times a year , seldom , or never ? ” Taken together , these two questions ( one about religious identity , the other about religious attendance ) can help shed light on religious trends in the U.S .
The data shows that just like rates of religious affiliation , rates of religious attendance are declining . Over the last decade , the share of Americans who say they attend religious services at least once or twice a month dropped by 7 percentage points , while the share who say they attend religious services less often ( if at all ) has risen by the same degree . In 2009 , regular worship attenders ( those who attend religious services at least once or twice a month ) outnumbered those who attend services only occasionally or not at all by a 52 % -to-47 % margin . Today those figures are reversed ; more Americans now say they attend religious services a few times a year or less ( 54 % ) than say they attend at least monthly ( 45 % ) .
The changes underway in the American religious landscape are broad-based . The Christian share of the population is down and religious “ nones ” have grown across multiple demographic groups : white people , black people and Hispanics ; men and women ; in all regions of the country ; and among college graduates and those with lower levels of educational attainment . Religious “ nones ” are growing faster among Democrats than Republicans , though their ranks are swelling in both partisan coalitions . And although the religiously unaffiliated are on the rise among younger people and most groups of older adults , their growth is most pronounced among young adults .
Furthermore , the data shows a wide gap between older Americans ( Baby Boomers and members of the Silent Generation ) and Millennials in their levels of religious affiliation and attendance . More than eight-in-ten members of the Silent Generation ( those born between 1928 and 1945 ) describe themselves as Christians ( 84 % ) , as do three-quarters of Baby Boomers ( 76 % ) . In stark contrast , only half of Millennials ( 49 % ) describe themselves as Christians ; four-in-ten are religious “ nones , ” and one-in-ten Millennials identify with non-Christian faiths .
Only about one-in-three Millennials say they attend religious services at least once or twice a month . Roughly two-thirds of Millennials ( 64 % ) attend worship services a few times a year or less often , including about four-in-ten who say they seldom or never go . Indeed , there are as many Millennials who say they “ never ” attend religious services ( 22 % ) as there are who say they go at least once a week ( 22 % ) .
While the trends are clear – the U.S. is steadily becoming less Christian and less religiously observant as the share of adults who are not religious grows – self-described Christians report that they attend religious services at about the same rate today as in 2009 . Today , 62 % of Christians say they attend religious services at least once or twice a month , which is identical to the share who said the same in 2009 . In other words , the nation ’ s overall rate of religious attendance is declining not because Christians are attending church less often , but rather because there are now fewer Christians as a share of the population .
The data suggests that Christians are declining not just as a share of the U.S. adult population , but also in absolute numbers . In 2009 , there were approximately 233 million adults in the U.S. , according to the Census Bureau . ███ ’ s RDD surveys conducted at the time indicated that 77 % of them were Christian , which means that by this measure , there were approximately 178 million Christian adults in the U.S. in 2009 . Taking the margin of error of the surveys into account , the number of adult Christians in the U.S. as of 2009 could have been as low as 176 million or as high as 181 million .
Today , there are roughly 23 million more adults in the U.S. than there were in 2009 ( 256 million as of July 1 , 2019 , according to the Census Bureau ) . About two-thirds of them ( 65 % ) identify as Christians , according to 2018 and 2019 ███ RDD estimates . This means that there are now roughly 167 million Christian adults in the U.S. ( with a lower bound of 164 million and an upper bound of 169 million , given the survey ’ s margin of error ) .
Meanwhile , the number of religiously unaffiliated adults in the U.S. grew by almost 30 million over this period .
The share of Americans who describe themselves as Mormons has held steady at 2 % over the past decade . Meanwhile , the share of U.S. adults who identify with non-Christian faiths has ticked up slightly , from 5 % in 2009 to 7 % today . This includes a steady 2 % of Americans who are Jewish , along with 1 % who are Muslim , 1 % who are Buddhist , 1 % who are Hindu , and 3 % who identify with other faiths ( including , for example , people who say they abide by their own personal religious beliefs and people who describe themselves as “ spiritual ” )

Today , 17 % of Americans say they never attend religious services , up from 11 % a decade ago . Similarly , the decline in regular churchgoing is attributable mainly to the shrinking share of Americans who say they attend religious services at least once a week , which was 37 % in 2009 and now stands at 31 % .

Similarly , the decline in regular churchgoing is attributable mainly to the shrinking share of Americans who say they attend religious services at least once a week , which was 37 % in 2009 and now stands at 31 % . The trends documented in ███ surveys closely resemble those found in the long-running General Social Survey ( GSS ) , a project of the independent research organization NORC at the University of Chicago , with principal funding from the National Science Foundation . In GSS surveys conducted in the early 2000s ( 2000 to 2004 ) , 80 % of U.S. adults identified as Christians , including 54 % who described themselves as Protestants and 25 % who were Catholic . By the late 2010s , 71 % of GSS respondents described themselves as Christians ( 48 % Protestant , 23 % Catholic ) . Over the same period , the GSS found that religious “ nones ” grew from 14 % of the U.S. adult population to 22 % .
The point estimates from the GSS and ███ surveys ( that is , the share of adults who identify as Protestant or Catholic or as religious “ nones ” ) are not directly comparable ; the two studies ask different questions and employ different modes of survey administration . But the fact that the direction of the trend is similar in both studies strongly suggests that both are picking up on real and significant change underway in the U.S. religious landscape .
Similarly , the GSS finds that a declining share of U.S. adults say they attend religious services regularly . In the most recent GSS studies , 43 % of respondents say they attend religious services at least monthly , down from 47 % in the early 2000s and 50 % in the early 1990s . Meanwhile , the share of U.S. adults who say they “ never ” attend religious services now stands at 27 % , up from 18 % in the early 2000s and roughly double the share who said this in the early 1990s ( 14 % ) .

In the most recent GSS studies , 43 % of respondents say they attend religious services at least monthly , down from 47 % in the early 2000s and 50 % in the early 1990s .

Catholics no longer constitute a majority of the U.S. Hispanic population . In ███ RDD surveys conducted in 2018 and 2019 , 47 % of Hispanics describe themselves as Catholic , down from 57 % a decade ago . Meanwhile , the share of Hispanics who say they are religiously unaffiliated is now 23 % , up from 15 % in 2009 .
These findings about the religious composition of Hispanics closely resemble those from ███ ’ s National Surveys of Latinos ( NSL ) – a nationally representative survey of U.S. Latino adults fielded almost every year . ( See the detailed tables for complete trends in the religious composition of Hispanics based on both ███ political surveys and the NSL . )
Among white adults , the share of people who say they attend religious services a few times a year or less now exceeds the share who attend monthly or more ( 57 % vs. 42 % ) ; a decade ago , the white population was evenly divided between those who went to church at least monthly and those who did not . Regular churchgoers still outnumber those who infrequently or never go to religious services among black Americans ( 58 % vs. 41 % ) , though the share of people who say they attend religious services a few times a year or less often has risen over the last decade among black Americans , just as it has among the population as a whole . U.S. Hispanics are now about evenly divided between those who say they attend religious services at least once or twice a month ( 51 % ) and those who say they attend a few times a year or less ( 49 % ) .

U.S. Hispanics are now about evenly divided between those who say they attend religious services at least once or twice a month ( 51 % ) and those who say they attend a few times a year or less ( 49 % ) . There is still a gender gap in American religion .

The religious landscape of the United States continues to change at a rapid clip. In Pew Research Center telephone surveys conducted in 2018 and 2019, 65% of American adults describe themselves as Christians when asked about their religion, down 12 percentage points over the past decade. Meanwhile, the religiously unaffiliated share of the population, consisting of people who describe their religious identity as atheist, agnostic or “nothing in particular,” now stands at 26%, up from 17% in 2009.

Both Protestantism and Catholicism are experiencing losses of population share. Currently, 43% of U.S. adults identify with Protestantism, down from 51% in 2009. And one-in-five adults (20%) are Catholic, down from 23% in 2009. Meanwhile, all subsets of the religiously unaffiliated population – a group also known as religious “nones” – have seen their numbers swell. Self-described atheists now account for 4% of U.S. adults, up modestly but significantly from 2% in 2009; agnostics make up 5% of U.S. adults, up from 3% a decade ago; and 17% of Americans now describe their religion as “nothing in particular,” up from 12% in 2009. Members of non-Christian religions also have grown modestly as a share of the adult population.

These are among the key findings of a new analysis of trends in the religious composition and churchgoing habits of the American public, based on recent Pew Research Center random-digit-dial (RDD) political polling on the telephone. The data shows that the trend toward religious disaffiliation documented in the Center’s 2007 and 2014 Religious Landscape Studies, and before that in major national studies like the General Social Survey (GSS), has continued apace.

Pew Research Center’s 2007 and 2014 Religious Landscape Studies were huge national RDD surveys, each of which included interviews with more than 35,000 respondents who were asked dozens of detailed questions about their religious identities, beliefs and practices. The Center has not yet conducted a third such study, and when the Landscape Study is repeated, it is likely to use new methods that may prevent it from being directly comparable to the previous studies; growing challenges to conducting national surveys by telephone have led the Center to rely increasingly on self-administered surveys conducted online.

But while no new Religious Landscape Study is available or in the immediate offing, the Center has collected five additional years of data (since the 2014 Landscape Study) from RDD political polls (see detailed tables). The samples from these political polls are not as large as the Landscape Studies (even when all of the political polls conducted in a year are combined), but together, 88 surveys from 2009 to 2019 included interviews with 168,890 Americans.

These surveys do not include nearly as many questions about religion as the Landscape Studies do. However, as part of the demographic battery of questions that ask respondents about their age, race, educational attainment and other background characteristics, each of these political polls also include one basic question about religious identity – “What is your present religion, if any? Are you Protestant, Roman Catholic, Mormon, Orthodox such as Greek or Russian Orthodox, Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu, atheist, agnostic, something else, or nothing in particular?”

Additionally, most of these political polls include a question about religious attendance – “Aside from weddings and funerals, how often do you attend religious services? More than once a week, once a week, once or twice a month, a few times a year, seldom, or never?” Taken together, these two questions (one about religious identity, the other about religious attendance) can help shed light on religious trends in the U.S.

The data shows that just like rates of religious affiliation, rates of religious attendance are declining. Over the last decade, the share of Americans who say they attend religious services at least once or twice a month dropped by 7 percentage points, while the share who say they attend religious services less often (if at all) has risen by the same degree. In 2009, regular worship attenders (those who attend religious services at least once or twice a month) outnumbered those who attend services only occasionally or not at all by a 52%-to-47% margin. Today those figures are reversed; more Americans now say they attend religious services a few times a year or less (54%) than say they attend at least monthly (45%).

The changes underway in the American religious landscape are broad-based. The Christian share of the population is down and religious “nones” have grown across multiple demographic groups: white people, black people and Hispanics; men and women; in all regions of the country; and among college graduates and those with lower levels of educational attainment. Religious “nones” are growing faster among Democrats than Republicans, though their ranks are swelling in both partisan coalitions. And although the religiously unaffiliated are on the rise among younger people and most groups of older adults, their growth is most pronounced among young adults.

Furthermore, the data shows a wide gap between older Americans (Baby Boomers and members of the Silent Generation) and Millennials in their levels of religious affiliation and attendance. More than eight-in-ten members of the Silent Generation (those born between 1928 and 1945) describe themselves as Christians (84%), as do three-quarters of Baby Boomers (76%). In stark contrast, only half of Millennials (49%) describe themselves as Christians; four-in-ten are religious “nones,” and one-in-ten Millennials identify with non-Christian faiths.

Only about one-in-three Millennials say they attend religious services at least once or twice a month. Roughly two-thirds of Millennials (64%) attend worship services a few times a year or less often, including about four-in-ten who say they seldom or never go. Indeed, there are as many Millennials who say they “never” attend religious services (22%) as there are who say they go at least once a week (22%).

While the trends are clear – the U.S. is steadily becoming less Christian and less religiously observant as the share of adults who are not religious grows – self-described Christians report that they attend religious services at about the same rate today as in 2009. Today, 62% of Christians say they attend religious services at least once or twice a month, which is identical to the share who said the same in 2009. In other words, the nation’s overall rate of religious attendance is declining not because Christians are attending church less often, but rather because there are now fewer Christians as a share of the population.

Other key takeaways from the new analysis include:

The data suggests that Christians are declining not just as a share of the U.S. adult population, but also in absolute numbers. In 2009, there were approximately 233 million adults in the U.S., according to the Census Bureau. Pew Research Center’s RDD surveys conducted at the time indicated that 77% of them were Christian, which means that by this measure, there were approximately 178 million Christian adults in the U.S. in 2009. Taking the margin of error of the surveys into account, the number of adult Christians in the U.S. as of 2009 could have been as low as 176 million or as high as 181 million.

Today, there are roughly 23 million more adults in the U.S. than there were in 2009 (256 million as of July 1, 2019, according to the Census Bureau). About two-thirds of them (65%) identify as Christians, according to 2018 and 2019 Pew Research Center RDD estimates. This means that there are now roughly 167 million Christian adults in the U.S. (with a lower bound of 164 million and an upper bound of 169 million, given the survey’s margin of error).

Meanwhile, the number of religiously unaffiliated adults in the U.S. grew by almost 30 million over this period.

The share of Americans who describe themselves as Mormons has held steady at 2% over the past decade. Meanwhile, the share of U.S. adults who identify with non-Christian faiths has ticked up slightly, from 5% in 2009 to 7% today. This includes a steady 2% of Americans who are Jewish, along with 1% who are Muslim, 1% who are Buddhist, 1% who are Hindu, and 3% who identify with other faiths (including, for example, people who say they abide by their own personal religious beliefs and people who describe themselves as “spiritual”)

Today, 17% of Americans say they never attend religious services, up from 11% a decade ago. Similarly, the decline in regular churchgoing is attributable mainly to the shrinking share of Americans who say they attend religious services at least once a week, which was 37% in 2009 and now stands at 31%.

The trends documented in Pew Research Center surveys closely resemble those found in the long-running General Social Survey (GSS), a project of the independent research organization NORC at the University of Chicago, with principal funding from the National Science Foundation. In GSS surveys conducted in the early 2000s (2000 to 2004), 80% of U.S. adults identified as Christians, including 54% who described themselves as Protestants and 25% who were Catholic. By the late 2010s, 71% of GSS respondents described themselves as Christians (48% Protestant, 23% Catholic). Over the same period, the GSS found that religious “nones” grew from 14% of the U.S. adult population to 22%.

The point estimates from the GSS and Pew Research Center surveys (that is, the share of adults who identify as Protestant or Catholic or as religious “nones”) are not directly comparable; the two studies ask different questions and employ different modes of survey administration. But the fact that the direction of the trend is similar in both studies strongly suggests that both are picking up on real and significant change underway in the U.S. religious landscape.

Similarly, the GSS finds that a declining share of U.S. adults say they attend religious services regularly. In the most recent GSS studies, 43% of respondents say they attend religious services at least monthly, down from 47% in the early 2000s and 50% in the early 1990s. Meanwhile, the share of U.S. adults who say they “never” attend religious services now stands at 27%, up from 18% in the early 2000s and roughly double the share who said this in the early 1990s (14%).

Catholics no longer constitute a majority of the U.S. Hispanic population. In Pew Research Center RDD surveys conducted in 2018 and 2019, 47% of Hispanics describe themselves as Catholic, down from 57% a decade ago. Meanwhile, the share of Hispanics who say they are religiously unaffiliated is now 23%, up from 15% in 2009.

These findings about the religious composition of Hispanics closely resemble those from Pew Research Center’s National Surveys of Latinos (NSL) – a nationally representative survey of U.S. Latino adults fielded almost every year. (See the detailed tables for complete trends in the religious composition of Hispanics based on both Pew Research Center political surveys and the NSL.)

Among white adults, the share of people who say they attend religious services a few times a year or less now exceeds the share who attend monthly or more (57% vs. 42%); a decade ago, the white population was evenly divided between those who went to church at least monthly and those who did not. Regular churchgoers still outnumber those who infrequently or never go to religious services among black Americans (58% vs. 41%), though the share of people who say they attend religious services a few times a year or less often has risen over the last decade among black Americans, just as it has among the population as a whole. U.S. Hispanics are now about evenly divided between those who say they attend religious services at least once or twice a month (51%) and those who say they attend a few times a year or less (49%).

But women, like men, have grown noticeably less religious over the last decade. The share of “nones” among women has risen by 10 percentage points since 2009 – similar to the increase among men. And the share of women who identify as Christian has fallen by 11 points (from 80% to 69%) over that same period.

Among Protestants, declines were larger in the South, where Protestants now account for 53% of the adult population, down from 64% in 2009.

Religious “nones” now make up fully one-third of Democrats. And about six-in-ten people who identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party say they attend religious services no more than a few times a year.

She calls on “leaders everywhere” to condemn “white supremacist terrorists,” one of the smallest hate groups on Earth, but never calls on leaders everywhere to condemn Islamist terrorists, the largest hate group on Earth.

These two tweets tell you a lot about Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. But far more importantly, they tell you a lot about the Left.

The U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments Wednesday in a major case that could dramatically alter the line separating church and state.

At issue is a Montana state constitutional amendment that bars direct and indirect taxpayer aid to religious institutions. Conservative religious groups and advocates of school choice are challenging the ""no-aid"" provision.

They have long sought to invalidate state constitutional amendments that prohibit taxpayer funding from going to religious schools. Given that Montana is one of 38 states with a ""no-aid"" provision, the court's eventual decision could have far-reaching consequences.

religion_and_faith,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/2018/6/1/17396182/jordan-peterson-alt-right-religion-catholicism,The religious hunger that drives Jordan Peterson’s fandom,2018-06-01,Tara Isabella Burton,"Few self-professed public intellectuals have captured the spirit of the moment like Jordan Peterson , the Canadian clinical pop philosopher whose atavistic advocacy of masculinist revivalism has made him the de facto guru of the right .
Peterson ’ s philosophy — enumerated in TED talks , YouTube videos for his 1.2 million subscribers , and self-help books ( his latest venture , 12 Rules for Life , topped several best-seller charts ) — is deceptively simple . Culture , he says , has historically been a battle between order ( traditionally conceived of as masculine ) and chaos ( traditionally feminine ) .
The great myths and legends of history , to say nothing of religious narratives , are supposedly rooted in this dichotomy : a dichotomy that humans crave . Our postmodern , post-Marxist ( left-wing , liberal , politically correct ) era has lost touch with this duality . We ’ ve become collectively feminized . In an era in which , in Peterson ’ s account , boys can “ decide to be ” girls , women abandon their natural and biological identity as caregivers , and men no longer stand up straight to “ be men , ” identities and contrast lose their meaning . The clear borders of culture have been dissolved .
But if men ( and , by and large , Peterson ’ s advice is geared to men ) stand tall , if they clean their rooms , if they embrace order and the kind of performative dominance so ubiquitous in the animal kingdom ( Peterson ’ s philosophy is spiked with a heady dose of evolutionary psychology ) , they can somehow get back to this longed-for primordial state . In so doing , the narrative goes , they will rediscover a sense of meaning and purpose the West has lost .
“ In the West , ” Peterson writes in 12 Rules , “ we have been withdrawing from our tradition- , religion- and even nation-centred cultures . ”
Peterson ’ s overarching narrative is one of renewal : make the West great again
There is nothing particularly novel or controversial about Peterson ’ s theories , which read like a Wikipedia summary of the philosophy of Nietzsche . The Birth of Tragedy traced the cultural tension between the “ Apollonian ” forces of order and the “ Dionysian ” ethos of chaos a good century and a half before Peterson .
But Peterson ’ s public persona has made him far more controversial than his relatively anodyne theories might suggest . After all , he first came to prominence for publicly refusing to use the preferred pronouns of his transgender students . Increasingly , he ’ s been associated with his fan base , which includes many on the alt-right , men ’ s rights activists , incels , and other reactionary corners of the internet landscape — though it should be noted that Peterson has often criticized the alt-right , and sees his message of personal responsibility as a path out of it .
What ’ s fascinating about Peterson is not the novelty of his ideas , but their power , and the quasi-religious influence he exerts on his followers . In a New York Times profile of Peterson , Nellie Bowles interviews a devotee who sees in Peterson ’ s philosophy a kind of grand unifying theory that made him rediscover religion . In Peterson ’ s interpretation of biblical stories , he says , he found the truth of his sexual frustration .
“ It made sense in a primordial way when he breaks down Adam and Eve , the snake and chaos , ” Bowles quotes her source as saying . “ Eve made Adam self-conscious . Women make men self-conscious because they ’ re the ultimate judge . I was like , ‘ Wow this is really true . ’ ”
It ’ s easy enough to dismiss Peterson , as some of his critics have done , as catering to the sexual frustrations and perceived loss of status of ( usually ) straight ( usually ) white ( usually ) men . But to do so is dangerous because it overlooks the degree to which Peterson has tapped into something very real , very necessary , and very strong : a legitimate spiritual hunger for meaning that , combined with the eroticized trappings of “ countercultural ” transgression , alchemize into a heady intellectual cocktail . ( Peterson declined through a representative to be interviewed for this article . )
The idea of the “ rebellious traditionalist ” — someone who at once hungers for an idealized past and is somehow considered thoroughly punk rock for doing so — is a perennial one , particularly in reactionary and far-right circles .
Take Julius Evola , the right-wing Italian philosopher active in the middle of the 20th century and who has been influential to modern right-wing figures , including Steve Bannon . He popularized the capital-T version of Traditionalism as an occult phenomenon : an attempt to recapture what he believed to be a primordial spiritual truth that all world religions had somehow fallen away from . Evola made his reactionary tendencies radical , describing his goals in highly sexualized and countercultural terms ( his most famous book title was the aptly named Revolt Against the Modern World ) .
We can see this ethos , too , in a number of reactionary and right-leaning movements today . It ’ s inherent , of course , in the very promise of “ Make America Great Again , ” and those who gleefully pepper the rhetoric of renewal with self-aggrandizing references to being “ deplorable. ” But it also finds expression in a number of other reactionary movements . The rise of Trad Catholicism ( not to mention Weird Catholic Twitter ) is one example — one that , for many , is a positive one : an opportunity to find identity through meaningful faith .
Yet we see it , too , in the rise of the alt-right , the “ manosphere , ” and the myriad intersecting — and at times intellectually contradictory — internet sub-movements that , for many of their members , operate as quasi-religions .
When I was interviewing a relatively well-known member of an alt-right Twitter group for an unrelated project a few months ago , he said that his excitement around the community was , in fact , something akin to a religious hunger . Referring to the concept of “ meme magic , ” the idea that various internet forums “ memed ” Trump into the presidency , he told me , “ It was like the whole world was enchanted . ”
It is that hunger for enchantment that Peterson capitalizes on so successfully .
Peterson ’ s appeal lies in his ability to speak to a fundamental human need
To dismiss Jordan Peterson ’ s appeal as just misogyny , or just “ straight white male victimhood ” ( even as these elements play a major part in his popularity ) , is to fundamentally misunderstand the nature of his success . What Peterson understands , and is able to capitalize on , is that people need stories . He understands that the cultural potency of images and myths , and the human need for them , are two of the strongest forces in the world . It is impossible to understand the appeal of any traditionalist or nostalgic movement without recognizing that , for better or for worse , they fulfill a legitimate emotional , aesthetic , and spiritual need .
That does not mean that Peterson is right ( the actual content of his self-help book is sufficiently vague and ill-defined that it ’ s really impossible to say he ’ s right or wrong ) ; nor that we should all become traditional Catholics ; nor ( of course ! ) that the racism , sexism , and outright Nazism that defines so much of the alt-right is excusable .
However , understanding why these kinds of movements are attractive to a wide variety of people who consider themselves , accurately or not , to be disenfranchised demands a serious engagement with the aesthetic and emotional appeal of what , for lack of a better term , I ’ ll call traditionalism : largely but not exclusively right-wing movements loosely defined by the rejection of modernity and promise of return to a better time . ( I ’ m distinguishing lowercase traditionalism from capital-T Traditionalism , Evola ’ s more technically conceived occult movement . )
This form of traditionalism is what Peterson talks about when he writes in 12 Rules that “ we have been withdrawing from our tradition- , religion- and even nation-centred cultures ” and that we must “ find sufficient meaning in individual consciousness and experience ” by revisiting “ the great myths ... of the past . ”
What traditionalist movements do , in their various ways , is provide adherents with two sensations . The first is the sense of the mythic . To be a believer is to live in a world of gods and monsters , good and evil , chaos and order . The world has an inherently meaningful and exciting structure .
The second is the opportunity to participate in that movement : a participation that blends the security of belonging to a cohesive group with the thrill of cultural transgression . To be a traditionalist is , increasingly , to be countercultural .
Without understanding that particular aesthetic appeal of contemporary traditionalism — that highly specific blend of rigidity and transgression — it is impossible to fully understand why so many people are drawn to it , and subsequently , all too often , to its handmaidens : sexism , racism , violence .
Let me declare a few biases here . I ’ m a religious Episcopalian Christian , one who instinctively feels an aesthetic connection to what is known as “ high church , ” “ smells and bells ” liturgy , and to traditional forms of Catholicism , even as my political views on some social issues put me at odds with elements of Catholic doctrine . As a result , I understand , and empathize with , some of the broader yearnings of traditionalism , even as I reject their right-wing political manifestations . In writing this essay , I neither wish to condemn those who in good faith hunger for meaningfulness nor to condone the far-right political stances into which men like Peterson steer their followers .
The hunger for meaning , for surety , for “ order ” — to use Peterson ’ s well-loved term — is a legitimate one . So , too , is the aesthetic appeal of perceived counterculturalism : the idealized rebel who defies bourgeois social norms . The irony , of course , is that many of the young straight white men who see themselves as “ countercultural ” because of their “ political incorrectness ” are doing little more than reinforcing the status quo .
But how is it that right-wing movements capitalize so effectively on both ?
The “ aesthetic ” mode has long been associated with right-wing movements
So what am I talking about when I talk about the “ aesthetic ” appeal of right-wing movements ? German culture critic Walter Benjamin , in his in 1936 essay “ The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction , ” writes that right-wing movements , which reach their zenith in fascism , represent “ the introduction of aesthetics into political life. ” While Benjamin is writing about fascism specifically here , his argument encompasses reactionary and right-wing movements more broadly .
While left-wing movements , he writes , work by advocating for “ affecting the property structure ” of capitalism , right-wing movements offer the masses a chance to “ express themselves ” while keeping the social order largely intact .
The ideal of traditionalist right-wing movements — which include , but are not limited to , fascist movements — is a kind of transformation of a person ’ s individual life into a mythic story . The narrative of return , the primordial “ going back ” that defines , say , “ make America Great Again ” ( or “ make Catholicism weird again ” ) , is fundamentally an aesthetic one : galvanizing the human desire to live a meaningful story . The imagined past is a place of structure , of significance .
We find this taken to extremes in , for example , explicitly fascist movements , which very much operate on this principle . Italian dictator Benito Mussolini , in his 1932 manifesto on fascism , makes his movement sound almost like a religion — a way for ordinary people to conceive of themselves as belonging to a world of mythic heroes . “ Fascism , ” he writes , “ respects the God of ascetics , saints , and heroes , and it also respects God as conceived by the ingenuous and primitive heart of the people , the God to whom their prayers are raised. ” Aestheticism , in this context , is the process by which individual political grievances are elevated to the level of myth .
Of course , this sense of nostalgia is totally ahistoric . History is very rarely as binary as myth , and human beings have been subverting the kind of grand dualistic categories ( masculine versus feminine , chaos versus order ) that Peterson idealizes for exactly as long as they ’ ve been around . Peterson devotes a whole section of his book to analyzing the creation narrative in the first chapter of Genesis in the Bible as the triumph of rational order , the divine word , over the symbolic “ formless deep ” of feminine chaos . After an extended discussion of the masculine nature of order and the feminine nature of chaos , Peterson comes to the conclusion that Genesis 1 recounts the “ emergence of order from chaos . ”
It ’ s not a wrong reading of Genesis 1 , exactly , but it ’ s seriously incomplete . The idea of the formation of the world as a result of a battle between order and chaos is , Peterson rightly notes , a common trope .
It ’ s an idea known to biblical scholars as chaoskampf ( chaos struggle ) , and it has analogues in other ancient Near Eastern creation myths , like the Babylonian Enuma Elish , in which the god Marduk defeats the water goddess Tiamat in order to create the world . Interestingly , Peterson does not cite these . ( Peterson has written about the Enuma Elish elsewhere , although it is absent from his account of Genesis 1 , in 12 Rules , which does not feature historical textual criticism . )
It ’ s also a dated ( and some scholars would say discredited ) academic idea . For many more contemporary biblical scholars , such as John Day , the authors of Genesis 1 were actively responding to , and rejecting , that chaoskampf tradition as expressed in other ancient Near Eastern creation myths : presenting a God who does not battle against chaos but encompasses it . Day writes frequently on how the writer of Genesis 1 “ demythologized ” earlier creation narratives ( including the ancient Near Eastern corpus , Psalm 104 , and the Egyptian Hymn to the Aten ) .
In other words , the very beginning of the Bible represents a literary subversion of the binary trope Peterson insists has defined human culture .
Now , Day is far from the only Old Testament scholar out there , and , certainly , biblical scholarship contains differing critical views . But by failing to engage with any of them , Peterson reduces what ’ s a very complex matter of biblical interpretation — one that involves Genesis 1 , as a text , in dialogue and opposition to other ancient Near Eastern creation myths — to a vague mythic archetype .
It ’ s just one example of the many ways Peterson has flattened history to fit mythic categories , rather than recognizing that these categories have , historically , always been in flux .
But just because these ideas aren ’ t historic , or linked to any genuine earlier time , doesn ’ t negate the fact that they incredibly powerful . The mythic quality of “ order versus chaos , ” as a narrative , transcends any place or time . If Peterson , and those like him , are successful at anything , they are successful at realizing just how vital symbolic , mythic categories are to the human experience .
Viktor Frankl , a Holocaust survivor and writer , famously came to the conclusion that a hunger for meaningfulness is at the heart of the human experience . In his best-selling 1946 account of his Holocaust experience , Man ’ s Search for Meaning , he posits that his ability to find structure even in the most horrific circumstances allowed him to survive psychologically .
Insofar as traditionalist ideas can provide a sense of order and meaning , they ’ re incredibly effective .
The idea of “ counterculturalism ” is central to the traditionalist narrative
There ’ s another element to understanding the attraction of contemporary traditionalist movements : sex appeal .
From Jordan Peterson ’ s fanboys to the wider alt-right , the idea that traditionalism is inherently countercultural is inextricably bound up with the idea that it ’ s somehow sexy , exciting , or a little bit punk . ( As I ’ ve previously written , the eroticization of the right wing is a longstanding cultural trope . )
There 's a new counterculture emerging on campuses and free speech is at the front lines https : //t.co/pleNcrDW3G — Jordan B Peterson ( @ jordanbpeterson ) July 5 , 2017
Peterson makes this dynamic explicit . One of his YouTube lectures is even called “ Growing Up and Being Useful is The New Counterculture . ”
Traditionalist movements often sell themselves as countercultural . The modern world ( or so the right-wing narrative often goes ) is corrupt , morally decrepit , decadent , and decayed . Standards have slipped . But by adopting a kind of moral or physical rigidity — something Peterson frequently demands of his followers , encouraging them to stand up straight or work out more or clear their rooms or take their meds — the adherent can somehow reject the temptations and vagaries of the modern world . It ’ s a curious fusion of orthodoxy and punk : an embrace of older values as a means of putting up the middle finger to contemporary ones .
That aesthetic , and the idea of traditionalism as a transgressive , countercultural identity , continues to dominate . Peterson characterizes himself as a warrior , a brave soldier willing to risk life and limb ( or at least career ) in order to ( to use a common right-wing phrase ) “ own the libs ” and stand up to political correctness . To follow Peterson is thus to be able to participate in the thrill of being transgressive without , well , having to do anything particularly transgressive .
Demanding a return to patriarchy — as many in the alt-right , incel , and men ’ s rights activists communities have done , and as Peterson himself has done — aren ’ t particularly transgressive behaviors . Indeed , one might say they remain explicitly culturally sanctioned . But the Petersonian narrative is one that allows adherents to identify themselves as dangerous ( even sexy ) transgressive figures without making actual demands on them .
The conflation of traditionalism and counterculturalism in its current form became particularly prominent in the late 19th and early 20th century . This was a time when secularism , urbanization , industrialization , and the rise of the urban middle class all served to make nostalgic “ traditionalism ” more appealing to those who felt themselves to be left behind by these developments .
In Europe , England , and America , at least , Catholicism was one of the major canvases on which these tensions played out . The works of writers like Graham Greene , Evelyn Waugh , and ( the Anglican , but very much aesthetically Catholic ) T.S . Eliot all embody these tropes .
Writing for the progressive Catholic magazine Commonweal , Patrick Baumann notes the abiding popularity among Catholics of the 1945 novel Brideshead Revisited , by Evelyn Waugh . In that novel ’ s denouement , the protagonist Charles ’ s love interest , Julia , renounces him , because she , in accordance with Catholic teaching , can not bring herself to remarry after a divorce . Although faith has not been a huge part of her life to this point , and although Julia and Charles would suffer little to no social recourse for doing so , Julia can not bring herself to ignore the “ twitch on the thread ” : a deep sense of conscience and sin .
She turns her back on Charles ( and on a permissive society ) . Charles later converts to Catholicism himself . It ’ s a hideous , difficult , and upsetting ending — from a secular perspective , Julia has made two people miserable for no reason . But it ’ s also an intensely powerful one : Julia ’ s abnegation is a willful rejection of bourgeois social norms in favor of a higher , harder calling . ( It ’ s a thoroughly punk move . )
Something of that aesthetic permeates the modern crop of traditionalist Catholics today . The Brideshead argument may have reached its zenith this year when a priest writing for the Catholic magazine First Things defended the 1858 Edgardo Mortara kidnapping — in which an illicitly baptized Jewish child was removed from his parents under Catholic law — as an example of the triumph of Catholic doctrine over morality .
Perhaps nowhere is the Petersonian aesthetic of transgressive traditionalism more apparent than in certain corners of the reactionary internet . Under the wider umbrella of the “ alt-right ” , a number of reactionary groups — some explicitly white nationalist or white supremacist , some less clearly defined — have sprung up , taking the Petersonian ethos to its extreme .
Among culturally telling permutations of the wider alt-right Twitter is an internet personality known as Bronze Age Pervert .
That ’ s not altogether clear . His profile photograph is of an impossibly buff man facing away from the camera . His bio identifies him as an “ Aspiring Nudist Bodybuilder . Free speech and anti-xenoestrogen activist. ” He ’ s been cited to me by a number of sources familiar with the cultural landscape of something of a leadership figure among devotees of Pepe the Frog . He frequently condemns other alt-right figures , such as Richard Spencer , at times suggesting they might be in league with the FBI .
His posts veer between retweeting MRA rhetoric about “ roasties ” ( slang for women with multiple sexual partners ) , claiming that Jordan Peterson plagiarized his suggestion of “ enforced monogamy ” from him ( in an earlier forum post , he claimed women should be reduced to breeding stock ) , and celebrating on # HandsomeThursdays the physiques of chiseled , muscular Aryan and Slavic men . It ’ s not clear , in his internet-slang-laced posts , where performative trolling ends and authentic far-right views begin , nor does it necessarily matter .
Nobody knows who Bronze Age Pervert is . But among a subset of internet denizens , he ’ s something of a demigod : a Jordan Peterson in miniature . He was well-known enough for the neoreactionary and proto-alt-right thinker Curtis Yarvin ( better known by his pseudonym , Mencius Moldbug ) to name-check him in a recent interview with an Atlantic journalist , telling Rosie Gray that Bronze Age Pervert was his contact inside the White House . While this seems to have been an attempt to troll Gray , it speaks to Bronze Age Pervert ’ s relative notoriety within this tight community .
An anonymous follower of his on another neoreactionary blog declared him the leader of the alt-right in language that , though comically over the top , nevertheless speaks to the fundamental mythic tendency of these movements :
Bursting away the built up rust of the last centuries so new myths may be sung . He frees us from the constrictions of historicism and geographism- placing the race question in the light of the Faustian imperial infinity . By having us all take up barbarism the Right is spared from the civcuck middling elements having too much a say ... new culture will be anti-fragile to the attaqs against it , it will soon give us victory . Long live our liege lord .
It ’ s , of course , ridiculous . But it ’ s also illustrative . What Peterson makes implicit , Bronge Age Pervert and his followers make explicit : the intersection of trolling ( complete with language taken straight from Internet memes ) and traditionalism . The traditionalist aesthetic allows for both an embrace of an imagined past — in which order is triumphant over chaos — and a thoroughly contemporary assumption of transgression .
Bronze Age Pervert is an embodiment of the strange and effective tension between nostalgia and transgression that makes men like Peterson so popular . His blend of say-anything internet irony , highly eroticized valorization of splendid “ warrior ” bodies , and atavistic appeals to return to an era when men were real men is as close as you can get to a distillation of the Petersonian essence .
In a Twitter DM interview , Bronze Age Pervert told me that he did not call himself a traditionalist “ because there ’ s no tradition I can think of that I ’ m trying to preserve. ” He looks , he said , to Homeric and Classical Greek thought , as well as to Tibetan Buddhism , but isn ’ t trying to “ adopt or revive ” them .
“ Most traditions are hostile to beauty and excellence , ” he said , although he believes in a “ biological hierarchy ” that privileges some traditions over others ( he ’ s a fan of the French , the Greeks , the Japanese ; he dislikes Ashkenazi Jews ) .
no usually like contorted pose for physiq display , but I believe he is engaging in yogic position on # HandsomeThursday ... calling forth powers of Left Hand Path pic.twitter.com/CmivNHEIgl — Bronze Age Pervert ( @ bronzeagemantis ) May 24 , 2018
He believes in the “ purgation of the corruption of the world and its rejuvenation through an age of barbarism , ” and promised to send me his manifesto .
He sent me a quote from a tweetbot posting quotes from controversial scholar Camille Paglia about how the “ great modernists ” — Joyce , Proust , Woolf , and others — had “ absorbed the great classical tradition , ” and thus , “ their gestures of rebellion make sense and have power . The power of rebellion comes from the power of tradition. ” ( I was unable to substantiate this quote in Paglia ’ s work , although it echoes a number of themes common in her writing . ) He denies that he and the rest of the community he calls # FrogTwitter advocate for any particular political project , like , say , a white ethnostate .
Rather , he says , they share a “ dissatisfaction with modern life in many ways for the same reasons liberals were dissatisfied before . ... It ’ s a world that ’ s tightly controlled , repressive , ugly , extremely polluted. ” The modern world is an “ open-air prison . ”
The very act of saying absurd or politically correct things , he says , is a form of transgression . “ There ’ s this completely failed and boring sclerotic establishment , and they deserve to be mocked . ”
Yet Bronze Age Pervert ’ s lack of interest in historical tradition only intensifies the mythic nature of the ideology he promotes . It ’ s traditionalism without a tradition — a valorization of warrior imagery and mythic heroes in the absence of any historic anchor . When his fans see the images he posts , he says , “ Many feel as if they ’ ve escaped the gravity of this trash world and returned to a time when the natural beauty of man could be displayed . ”
Let me be clear : I ’ m not citing Bronze Age Pervert here because I believe his ideology deserves a platform . However , understanding the popularity of figures like Peterson more generally requires understanding what it looks like when the subtext of these highly aesthetic ideologies is made text . Peterson ’ s implicit rhetoric of order and chaos , once distilled , leads us inexorably to # HandsomeThursdays .
One of the best books ever written about the appeal of right-wing movements is one that is not explicitly political . It is Muriel Spark ’ s 1961 The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie . Ostensibly the story of several school girls and their charismatic teacher , the book explores how the titular Miss Brodie — a canonical fascist and Nazi sympathizer — corrupts her young charges by making them feel special and clever .
Her chosen “ set ” is set apart from ordinary girls . Echoing fascist rhetoric of Mussolini ( whom she admires as a “ man ... of action ” ) , Miss Brodie promises her students “ Goodness , Truth and Beauty ” over safety , filling their heads with beautiful and appealing stories of history and art and promising them that they , one day , will ascend into the number of the glorious . In reality , she pushes them into toxic and inappropriate sexual relationships and indirectly causes the death of one of them .
What makes the book so powerful is that it understands the fundamental draw of right-wing traditionalist ideology . It fulfills authentic needs — for meaningfulness , for a sense of structure — by providing adherents with a sense of their own “ specialness ” in a mythic narrative created for them , a specialness further intensified by the highly eroticized thrill of transgression .
It is easy , and necessary , to condemn the racism , sexism , and classism that make ideologies like Peterson ’ s so popular . But it ’ s vital to understand their effectiveness in order to counter it . What Peterson and even Bronze Age Pervert understand is that people fundamentally need stories of meaning , and that in an increasingly secular age , those stories are not necessarily culturally present .","Few self-professed public intellectuals have captured the spirit of the moment like Jordan Peterson, the Canadian clinical pop philosopher whose atavistic advocacy of masculinist revivalism has made him the de facto guru of the right.

Peterson’s philosophy — enumerated in TED talks, YouTube videos for his 1.2 million subscribers, and self-help books (his latest venture, 12 Rules for Life, topped several best-seller charts) — is deceptively simple. Culture, he says, has historically been a battle between order (traditionally conceived of as masculine) and chaos (traditionally feminine).

The great myths and legends of history, to say nothing of religious narratives, are supposedly rooted in this dichotomy: a dichotomy that humans crave. Our postmodern, post-Marxist (left-wing, liberal, politically correct) era has lost touch with this duality. We’ve become collectively feminized. In an era in which, in Peterson’s account, boys can “decide to be” girls, women abandon their natural and biological identity as caregivers, and men no longer stand up straight to “be men,” identities and contrast lose their meaning. The clear borders of culture have been dissolved.

But if men (and, by and large, Peterson’s advice is geared to men) stand tall, if they clean their rooms, if they embrace order and the kind of performative dominance so ubiquitous in the animal kingdom (Peterson’s philosophy is spiked with a heady dose of evolutionary psychology), they can somehow get back to this longed-for primordial state. In so doing, the narrative goes, they will rediscover a sense of meaning and purpose the West has lost.

“In the West,” Peterson writes in 12 Rules, “we have been withdrawing from our tradition-, religion- and even nation-centred cultures.”

Peterson’s overarching narrative is one of renewal: make the West great again

There is nothing particularly novel or controversial about Peterson’s theories, which read like a Wikipedia summary of the philosophy of Nietzsche. The Birth of Tragedy traced the cultural tension between the “Apollonian” forces of order and the “Dionysian” ethos of chaos a good century and a half before Peterson.

But Peterson’s public persona has made him far more controversial than his relatively anodyne theories might suggest. After all, he first came to prominence for publicly refusing to use the preferred pronouns of his transgender students. Increasingly, he’s been associated with his fan base, which includes many on the alt-right, men’s rights activists, incels, and other reactionary corners of the internet landscape — though it should be noted that Peterson has often criticized the alt-right, and sees his message of personal responsibility as a path out of it.

What’s fascinating about Peterson is not the novelty of his ideas, but their power, and the quasi-religious influence he exerts on his followers. In a New York Times profile of Peterson, Nellie Bowles interviews a devotee who sees in Peterson’s philosophy a kind of grand unifying theory that made him rediscover religion. In Peterson’s interpretation of biblical stories, he says, he found the truth of his sexual frustration.

“It made sense in a primordial way when he breaks down Adam and Eve, the snake and chaos,” Bowles quotes her source as saying. “Eve made Adam self-conscious. Women make men self-conscious because they’re the ultimate judge. I was like, ‘Wow this is really true.’”

It’s easy enough to dismiss Peterson, as some of his critics have done, as catering to the sexual frustrations and perceived loss of status of (usually) straight (usually) white (usually) men. But to do so is dangerous because it overlooks the degree to which Peterson has tapped into something very real, very necessary, and very strong: a legitimate spiritual hunger for meaning that, combined with the eroticized trappings of “countercultural” transgression, alchemize into a heady intellectual cocktail. (Peterson declined through a representative to be interviewed for this article.)

The idea of the “rebellious traditionalist” — someone who at once hungers for an idealized past and is somehow considered thoroughly punk rock for doing so — is a perennial one, particularly in reactionary and far-right circles.

Take Julius Evola, the right-wing Italian philosopher active in the middle of the 20th century and who has been influential to modern right-wing figures, including Steve Bannon. He popularized the capital-T version of Traditionalism as an occult phenomenon: an attempt to recapture what he believed to be a primordial spiritual truth that all world religions had somehow fallen away from. Evola made his reactionary tendencies radical, describing his goals in highly sexualized and countercultural terms (his most famous book title was the aptly named Revolt Against the Modern World).

We can see this ethos, too, in a number of reactionary and right-leaning movements today. It’s inherent, of course, in the very promise of “Make America Great Again,” and those who gleefully pepper the rhetoric of renewal with self-aggrandizing references to being “deplorable.” But it also finds expression in a number of other reactionary movements. The rise of Trad Catholicism (not to mention Weird Catholic Twitter) is one example — one that, for many, is a positive one: an opportunity to find identity through meaningful faith.

Yet we see it, too, in the rise of the alt-right, the “manosphere,” and the myriad intersecting — and at times intellectually contradictory — internet sub-movements that, for many of their members, operate as quasi-religions.

When I was interviewing a relatively well-known member of an alt-right Twitter group for an unrelated project a few months ago, he said that his excitement around the community was, in fact, something akin to a religious hunger. Referring to the concept of “meme magic,” the idea that various internet forums “memed” Trump into the presidency, he told me, “It was like the whole world was enchanted.”

It is that hunger for enchantment that Peterson capitalizes on so successfully.

Peterson’s appeal lies in his ability to speak to a fundamental human need

To dismiss Jordan Peterson’s appeal as just misogyny, or just “straight white male victimhood” (even as these elements play a major part in his popularity), is to fundamentally misunderstand the nature of his success. What Peterson understands, and is able to capitalize on, is that people need stories. He understands that the cultural potency of images and myths, and the human need for them, are two of the strongest forces in the world. It is impossible to understand the appeal of any traditionalist or nostalgic movement without recognizing that, for better or for worse, they fulfill a legitimate emotional, aesthetic, and spiritual need.

That does not mean that Peterson is right (the actual content of his self-help book is sufficiently vague and ill-defined that it’s really impossible to say he’s right or wrong); nor that we should all become traditional Catholics; nor (of course!) that the racism, sexism, and outright Nazism that defines so much of the alt-right is excusable.

However, understanding why these kinds of movements are attractive to a wide variety of people who consider themselves, accurately or not, to be disenfranchised demands a serious engagement with the aesthetic and emotional appeal of what, for lack of a better term, I’ll call traditionalism: largely but not exclusively right-wing movements loosely defined by the rejection of modernity and promise of return to a better time. (I’m distinguishing lowercase traditionalism from capital-T Traditionalism, Evola’s more technically conceived occult movement.)

This form of traditionalism is what Peterson talks about when he writes in 12 Rules that “we have been withdrawing from our tradition-, religion- and even nation-centred cultures” and that we must “find sufficient meaning in individual consciousness and experience” by revisiting “the great myths ... of the past.”

What traditionalist movements do, in their various ways, is provide adherents with two sensations. The first is the sense of the mythic. To be a believer is to live in a world of gods and monsters, good and evil, chaos and order. The world has an inherently meaningful and exciting structure.

The second is the opportunity to participate in that movement: a participation that blends the security of belonging to a cohesive group with the thrill of cultural transgression. To be a traditionalist is, increasingly, to be countercultural.

Without understanding that particular aesthetic appeal of contemporary traditionalism — that highly specific blend of rigidity and transgression — it is impossible to fully understand why so many people are drawn to it, and subsequently, all too often, to its handmaidens: sexism, racism, violence.

Let me declare a few biases here. I’m a religious Episcopalian Christian, one who instinctively feels an aesthetic connection to what is known as “high church,” “smells and bells” liturgy, and to traditional forms of Catholicism, even as my political views on some social issues put me at odds with elements of Catholic doctrine. As a result, I understand, and empathize with, some of the broader yearnings of traditionalism, even as I reject their right-wing political manifestations. In writing this essay, I neither wish to condemn those who in good faith hunger for meaningfulness nor to condone the far-right political stances into which men like Peterson steer their followers.

The hunger for meaning, for surety, for “order” — to use Peterson’s well-loved term — is a legitimate one. So, too, is the aesthetic appeal of perceived counterculturalism: the idealized rebel who defies bourgeois social norms. The irony, of course, is that many of the young straight white men who see themselves as “countercultural” because of their “political incorrectness” are doing little more than reinforcing the status quo.

But how is it that right-wing movements capitalize so effectively on both?

The “aesthetic” mode has long been associated with right-wing movements

So what am I talking about when I talk about the “aesthetic” appeal of right-wing movements? German culture critic Walter Benjamin, in his in 1936 essay “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,” writes that right-wing movements, which reach their zenith in fascism, represent “the introduction of aesthetics into political life.” While Benjamin is writing about fascism specifically here, his argument encompasses reactionary and right-wing movements more broadly.

While left-wing movements, he writes, work by advocating for “affecting the property structure” of capitalism, right-wing movements offer the masses a chance to “express themselves” while keeping the social order largely intact.

The ideal of traditionalist right-wing movements — which include, but are not limited to, fascist movements — is a kind of transformation of a person’s individual life into a mythic story. The narrative of return, the primordial “going back” that defines, say, “make America Great Again” (or “make Catholicism weird again”), is fundamentally an aesthetic one: galvanizing the human desire to live a meaningful story. The imagined past is a place of structure, of significance.

We find this taken to extremes in, for example, explicitly fascist movements, which very much operate on this principle. Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, in his 1932 manifesto on fascism, makes his movement sound almost like a religion — a way for ordinary people to conceive of themselves as belonging to a world of mythic heroes. “Fascism,” he writes, “respects the God of ascetics, saints, and heroes, and it also respects God as conceived by the ingenuous and primitive heart of the people, the God to whom their prayers are raised.” Aestheticism, in this context, is the process by which individual political grievances are elevated to the level of myth.

Of course, this sense of nostalgia is totally ahistoric. History is very rarely as binary as myth, and human beings have been subverting the kind of grand dualistic categories (masculine versus feminine, chaos versus order) that Peterson idealizes for exactly as long as they’ve been around. Peterson devotes a whole section of his book to analyzing the creation narrative in the first chapter of Genesis in the Bible as the triumph of rational order, the divine word, over the symbolic “formless deep” of feminine chaos. After an extended discussion of the masculine nature of order and the feminine nature of chaos, Peterson comes to the conclusion that Genesis 1 recounts the “emergence of order from chaos.”

It’s not a wrong reading of Genesis 1, exactly, but it’s seriously incomplete. The idea of the formation of the world as a result of a battle between order and chaos is, Peterson rightly notes, a common trope.

It’s an idea known to biblical scholars as chaoskampf (chaos struggle), and it has analogues in other ancient Near Eastern creation myths, like the Babylonian Enuma Elish, in which the god Marduk defeats the water goddess Tiamat in order to create the world. Interestingly, Peterson does not cite these. (Peterson has written about the Enuma Elish elsewhere, although it is absent from his account of Genesis 1, in 12 Rules, which does not feature historical textual criticism.)

It’s also a dated (and some scholars would say discredited) academic idea. For many more contemporary biblical scholars, such as John Day, the authors of Genesis 1 were actively responding to, and rejecting, that chaoskampf tradition as expressed in other ancient Near Eastern creation myths: presenting a God who does not battle against chaos but encompasses it. Day writes frequently on how the writer of Genesis 1 “demythologized” earlier creation narratives (including the ancient Near Eastern corpus, Psalm 104, and the Egyptian Hymn to the Aten).

In other words, the very beginning of the Bible represents a literary subversion of the binary trope Peterson insists has defined human culture.

Now, Day is far from the only Old Testament scholar out there, and, certainly, biblical scholarship contains differing critical views. But by failing to engage with any of them, Peterson reduces what’s a very complex matter of biblical interpretation — one that involves Genesis 1, as a text, in dialogue and opposition to other ancient Near Eastern creation myths — to a vague mythic archetype.

It’s just one example of the many ways Peterson has flattened history to fit mythic categories, rather than recognizing that these categories have, historically, always been in flux.

But just because these ideas aren’t historic, or linked to any genuine earlier time, doesn’t negate the fact that they incredibly powerful. The mythic quality of “order versus chaos,” as a narrative, transcends any place or time. If Peterson, and those like him, are successful at anything, they are successful at realizing just how vital symbolic, mythic categories are to the human experience.

Viktor Frankl, a Holocaust survivor and writer, famously came to the conclusion that a hunger for meaningfulness is at the heart of the human experience. In his best-selling 1946 account of his Holocaust experience, Man’s Search for Meaning, he posits that his ability to find structure even in the most horrific circumstances allowed him to survive psychologically.

Insofar as traditionalist ideas can provide a sense of order and meaning, they’re incredibly effective.

The idea of “counterculturalism” is central to the traditionalist narrative

There’s another element to understanding the attraction of contemporary traditionalist movements: sex appeal.

From Jordan Peterson’s fanboys to the wider alt-right, the idea that traditionalism is inherently countercultural is inextricably bound up with the idea that it’s somehow sexy, exciting, or a little bit punk. (As I’ve previously written, the eroticization of the right wing is a longstanding cultural trope.)

There's a new counterculture emerging on campuses and free speech is at the front lines https://t.co/pleNcrDW3G — Jordan B Peterson (@jordanbpeterson) July 5, 2017

Peterson makes this dynamic explicit. One of his YouTube lectures is even called “Growing Up and Being Useful is The New Counterculture.”

Traditionalist movements often sell themselves as countercultural. The modern world (or so the right-wing narrative often goes) is corrupt, morally decrepit, decadent, and decayed. Standards have slipped. But by adopting a kind of moral or physical rigidity — something Peterson frequently demands of his followers, encouraging them to stand up straight or work out more or clear their rooms or take their meds — the adherent can somehow reject the temptations and vagaries of the modern world. It’s a curious fusion of orthodoxy and punk: an embrace of older values as a means of putting up the middle finger to contemporary ones.

That aesthetic, and the idea of traditionalism as a transgressive, countercultural identity, continues to dominate. Peterson characterizes himself as a warrior, a brave soldier willing to risk life and limb (or at least career) in order to (to use a common right-wing phrase) “own the libs” and stand up to political correctness. To follow Peterson is thus to be able to participate in the thrill of being transgressive without, well, having to do anything particularly transgressive.

Demanding a return to patriarchy — as many in the alt-right, incel, and men’s rights activists communities have done, and as Peterson himself has done — aren’t particularly transgressive behaviors. Indeed, one might say they remain explicitly culturally sanctioned. But the Petersonian narrative is one that allows adherents to identify themselves as dangerous (even sexy) transgressive figures without making actual demands on them.

The alt-right aesthetic isn’t limited to Peterson

The conflation of traditionalism and counterculturalism in its current form became particularly prominent in the late 19th and early 20th century. This was a time when secularism, urbanization, industrialization, and the rise of the urban middle class all served to make nostalgic “traditionalism” more appealing to those who felt themselves to be left behind by these developments.

In Europe, England, and America, at least, Catholicism was one of the major canvases on which these tensions played out. The works of writers like Graham Greene, Evelyn Waugh, and (the Anglican, but very much aesthetically Catholic) T.S. Eliot all embody these tropes.

Writing for the progressive Catholic magazine Commonweal, Patrick Baumann notes the abiding popularity among Catholics of the 1945 novel Brideshead Revisited, by Evelyn Waugh. In that novel’s denouement, the protagonist Charles’s love interest, Julia, renounces him, because she, in accordance with Catholic teaching, cannot bring herself to remarry after a divorce. Although faith has not been a huge part of her life to this point, and although Julia and Charles would suffer little to no social recourse for doing so, Julia cannot bring herself to ignore the “twitch on the thread”: a deep sense of conscience and sin.

She turns her back on Charles (and on a permissive society). Charles later converts to Catholicism himself. It’s a hideous, difficult, and upsetting ending — from a secular perspective, Julia has made two people miserable for no reason. But it’s also an intensely powerful one: Julia’s abnegation is a willful rejection of bourgeois social norms in favor of a higher, harder calling. (It’s a thoroughly punk move.)

Something of that aesthetic permeates the modern crop of traditionalist Catholics today. The Brideshead argument may have reached its zenith this year when a priest writing for the Catholic magazine First Things defended the 1858 Edgardo Mortara kidnapping — in which an illicitly baptized Jewish child was removed from his parents under Catholic law — as an example of the triumph of Catholic doctrine over morality.

Perhaps nowhere is the Petersonian aesthetic of transgressive traditionalism more apparent than in certain corners of the reactionary internet. Under the wider umbrella of the “alt-right”, a number of reactionary groups — some explicitly white nationalist or white supremacist, some less clearly defined — have sprung up, taking the Petersonian ethos to its extreme.

Among culturally telling permutations of the wider alt-right Twitter is an internet personality known as Bronze Age Pervert.

Who is Bronze Age Pervert?

That’s not altogether clear. His profile photograph is of an impossibly buff man facing away from the camera. His bio identifies him as an “Aspiring Nudist Bodybuilder. Free speech and anti-xenoestrogen activist.” He’s been cited to me by a number of sources familiar with the cultural landscape of something of a leadership figure among devotees of Pepe the Frog. He frequently condemns other alt-right figures, such as Richard Spencer, at times suggesting they might be in league with the FBI.

His posts veer between retweeting MRA rhetoric about “roasties” (slang for women with multiple sexual partners), claiming that Jordan Peterson plagiarized his suggestion of “enforced monogamy” from him (in an earlier forum post, he claimed women should be reduced to breeding stock), and celebrating on #HandsomeThursdays the physiques of chiseled, muscular Aryan and Slavic men. It’s not clear, in his internet-slang-laced posts, where performative trolling ends and authentic far-right views begin, nor does it necessarily matter.

Nobody knows who Bronze Age Pervert is. But among a subset of internet denizens, he’s something of a demigod: a Jordan Peterson in miniature. He was well-known enough for the neoreactionary and proto-alt-right thinker Curtis Yarvin (better known by his pseudonym, Mencius Moldbug) to name-check him in a recent interview with an Atlantic journalist, telling Rosie Gray that Bronze Age Pervert was his contact inside the White House. While this seems to have been an attempt to troll Gray, it speaks to Bronze Age Pervert’s relative notoriety within this tight community.

An anonymous follower of his on another neoreactionary blog declared him the leader of the alt-right in language that, though comically over the top, nevertheless speaks to the fundamental mythic tendency of these movements:

Bursting away the built up rust of the last centuries so new myths may be sung. He frees us from the constrictions of historicism and geographism- placing the race question in the light of the Faustian imperial infinity. By having us all take up barbarism the Right is spared from the civcuck middling elements having too much a say ... new culture will be anti-fragile to the attaqs against it, it will soon give us victory. Long live our liege lord.

It’s, of course, ridiculous. But it’s also illustrative. What Peterson makes implicit, Bronge Age Pervert and his followers make explicit: the intersection of trolling (complete with language taken straight from Internet memes) and traditionalism. The traditionalist aesthetic allows for both an embrace of an imagined past — in which order is triumphant over chaos — and a thoroughly contemporary assumption of transgression.

Bronze Age Pervert is an embodiment of the strange and effective tension between nostalgia and transgression that makes men like Peterson so popular. His blend of say-anything internet irony, highly eroticized valorization of splendid “warrior” bodies, and atavistic appeals to return to an era when men were real men is as close as you can get to a distillation of the Petersonian essence.

In one tweet, Bronze Age Pervert posts a painting of a naked wood nymph with a thoroughly Nietzschean caption: “return of the maenads ...... imagine being torn limb from limb by crazed bacchant-gril as irregular drums beat and very thin, circular demented melody plays on two flutes handled by goat-men ... I want such death.”

In a Twitter DM interview, Bronze Age Pervert told me that he did not call himself a traditionalist “because there’s no tradition I can think of that I’m trying to preserve.” He looks, he said, to Homeric and Classical Greek thought, as well as to Tibetan Buddhism, but isn’t trying to “adopt or revive” them.

“Most traditions are hostile to beauty and excellence,” he said, although he believes in a “biological hierarchy” that privileges some traditions over others (he’s a fan of the French, the Greeks, the Japanese; he dislikes Ashkenazi Jews).

He believes in the “purgation of the corruption of the world and its rejuvenation through an age of barbarism,” and promised to send me his manifesto.

He sent me a quote from a tweetbot posting quotes from controversial scholar Camille Paglia about how the “great modernists” — Joyce, Proust, Woolf, and others — had “absorbed the great classical tradition,” and thus, “their gestures of rebellion make sense and have power. The power of rebellion comes from the power of tradition.” (I was unable to substantiate this quote in Paglia’s work, although it echoes a number of themes common in her writing.) He denies that he and the rest of the community he calls #FrogTwitter advocate for any particular political project, like, say, a white ethnostate.

Rather, he says, they share a “dissatisfaction with modern life in many ways for the same reasons liberals were dissatisfied before. ... It’s a world that’s tightly controlled, repressive, ugly, extremely polluted.” The modern world is an “open-air prison.”

The very act of saying absurd or politically correct things, he says, is a form of transgression. “There’s this completely failed and boring sclerotic establishment, and they deserve to be mocked.”

Yet Bronze Age Pervert’s lack of interest in historical tradition only intensifies the mythic nature of the ideology he promotes. It’s traditionalism without a tradition — a valorization of warrior imagery and mythic heroes in the absence of any historic anchor. When his fans see the images he posts, he says, “Many feel as if they’ve escaped the gravity of this trash world and returned to a time when the natural beauty of man could be displayed.”

Let me be clear: I’m not citing Bronze Age Pervert here because I believe his ideology deserves a platform. However, understanding the popularity of figures like Peterson more generally requires understanding what it looks like when the subtext of these highly aesthetic ideologies is made text. Peterson’s implicit rhetoric of order and chaos, once distilled, leads us inexorably to #HandsomeThursdays.

One of the best books ever written about the appeal of right-wing movements is one that is not explicitly political. It is Muriel Spark’s 1961 The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie. Ostensibly the story of several school girls and their charismatic teacher, the book explores how the titular Miss Brodie — a canonical fascist and Nazi sympathizer — corrupts her young charges by making them feel special and clever.

Her chosen “set” is set apart from ordinary girls. Echoing fascist rhetoric of Mussolini (whom she admires as a “man ... of action”), Miss Brodie promises her students “Goodness, Truth and Beauty” over safety, filling their heads with beautiful and appealing stories of history and art and promising them that they, one day, will ascend into the number of the glorious. In reality, she pushes them into toxic and inappropriate sexual relationships and indirectly causes the death of one of them.

What makes the book so powerful is that it understands the fundamental draw of right-wing traditionalist ideology. It fulfills authentic needs — for meaningfulness, for a sense of structure — by providing adherents with a sense of their own “specialness” in a mythic narrative created for them, a specialness further intensified by the highly eroticized thrill of transgression.

It is easy, and necessary, to condemn the racism, sexism, and classism that make ideologies like Peterson’s so popular. But it’s vital to understand their effectiveness in order to counter it. What Peterson and even Bronze Age Pervert understand is that people fundamentally need stories of meaning, and that in an increasingly secular age, those stories are not necessarily culturally present.

It’s just a shame we don’t have better storytellers.",www.vox.com,left,PpXsuu7oR5TrZMlB

""There was just something about him,'' Maggie said. "" I don't know what it was, but you believed him. On the crusades, on TV, he spoke, and you listened.''

But some said Graham's impact already has diminished. Several years ago, when Balmer asked one of his classes at Dartmouth if they knew who Billy Graham was, only 25% raised a hand.

Robert described him as essentially a phenomenon of the Greatest and Boomer generations.

The Trump administration is right to champion Americans’ right to religious liberty.

Last Monday, the Department of Justice announced the creation of its new Religious Liberty Task Force, a working group within the agency formed to protect the “first freedom” recognized in the Bill of Rights.

Promptly following the announcement, a cyber-mob inadvertently confirmed the importance of the new initiative.

Participants practically trampled each other in a mad dash to denounce the Religious Liberty Task Force as the latest sign that the end is nigh. Evidently, it’s just a matter of time before a nefarious coalition of “Christian nationalists” and real-life characters from The Handmaid’s Tale take over the country by force.

By the time Tuesday morning rolled around, New York Times best-selling author Kurt Eichenwald had emerged as the clear winner in the online race to the bottom. Artfully combining snark with ignorance and downright dishonesty — all in the space of just one tweet — Eichenwald provided a well-rounded sampling of the outcry against the DOJ.

“I am delighted that Religious Liberty Task Force will finally protect people who face problems because of their religions: Muslims, Jews, Sikhs and other religious minorities,” Eichenwald tweeted. “What? Oh, this is just about hating gays and forcing people to say Merry Christmas? What a shock.”

While Eichenwald’s hot take gained plenty of traction, others — including one uniquely bizarre essay by a self-identified Baptist pastor writing at NBCNews.com — joined him in building a false narrative that only Christians who still hold to a biblical definition of marriage stand to gain from the DOJ’s new efforts.

But the knee-jerk reactions ignored a truly unifying reality that the task force — indeed, religious liberty itself — represents.

Yes, the DOJ’s commitment to uphold the First Amendment’s guarantee of the free exercise of religion applies to Christians (like Masterpiece Cakeshop owner Jack Phillips, who was one of the panelists at the DOJ’s Summit on Religious Liberty), but every American wins when the government allows religious adherents to peacefully live out their beliefs.

Religious liberty applies to every American, not just one group. Far from the caricature Eichenwald and others put forward, the list of panelists at the DOJ Summit included Muslims, Jews, and Sikhs working together to ensure the American promise of religious liberty to adherents to any faith — including secularism and atheism.

`` I would like for all of us , after these days of grace , that we find courage to walk in the presence of God ... and to build the church with the blood of Christ , '' the pope continued . `` Only this way will the church move forward . ''
During the service , the cardinals prayed for the new pope and Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI so `` that he may serve the Church while hidden to the world , in a life dedicated to prayer and meditation , '' the Vatican said .
When Jorge Bergoglio stepped onto the balcony at the Vatican on Wednesday evening to reveal himself as the new leader of the world 's 1.2 billion Catholics , he made history as the first non-European pope of the modern era , the first from Latin America , the first Jesuit and the first to assume the name Francis .
Francis began Thursday by praying at the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome , a place of special significance for the Jesuits .
His next public appearance is likely to be Sunday . The new pontiff will `` very probably '' celebrate Mass at St. Peter 's and then deliver the traditional Angelus blessing , said the Rev . Federico Lombardi , a Vatican spokesman .
But it wo n't be until Tuesday that Francis will be formally installed as pope .
That 's by design . The day coincides with the Feast of St. Joseph , the patron saint of Italy .
In a letter dated Wednesday to Rome 's chief rabbi , the new pope promised `` renovated cooperation '' between Catholics and Jews .
`` I vividly hope I 'll contribute to the progress '' of relations between Jewish and Catholic people that they `` have known starting from the Vatican II Council '' in the 1960s , Francis wrote to Riccardo Di Segni .
The new pope said he was also acting in a spirit of `` helping the world to be always more in harmony with the will of the Creator . ''
The new pontiff will meet with all the cardinals , not just those who were eligible to vote for him , on Friday and will hold an audience with the media on Saturday , Lombardi said .
Already , a picture is emerging of a humble man who shies away from the trappings of his new status and is devoted to his pastoral duties .
As pope , Francis will have plenty to deal with . He takes the helm of a Roman Catholic Church that has been rocked in recent years by sex abuse by priests , and claims of corruption and infighting among the church hierarchy .
Reflecting the urgency of those concerns , a group representing the alleged victims of sexual abuse by priests has written an open letter to Francis requesting a meeting .
`` Your predecessor met only a few times with a few carefully chosen victims in tightly choreographed settings , as he visited nations where this crisis had reached a fever pitch , '' the letter from the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests states .
`` We write today seeking a different kind of meeting -- one in which our respective organizations -- yours , huge and struggling , and ours , small and struggling -- can begin to work together to safeguard children across the globe . ''
Meanwhile , in Los Angeles , one alleged victim of priest sex abuse , Michael Duran , urged Pope Francis to give Catholics new hope and make priests and cardinals accountable for their actions in cases where children have been sexually abused by clergymen .
Duran said he was sexually abused for three years by a Los Angeles Archdiocese priest beginning in 1983 , when Duran was 11 .
He and three other men allegedly sexually abused as boys by the same priest settled their lawsuits for $ 9.9 million against the archdiocese , Cardinal Roger Mahony and the now defrocked priest . Mahony was among the 115 cardinals in Rome who participated in the papal election this week .
Duran said he felt vindicated by the settlement . He and his attorney said authorities should investigate Mahony for his handling of child abuse complaints against the former priest , Michael Baker . The priest , who could n't be reached for comment , served a prison sentence for molesting boys , Duran 's attorneys said .
The 76-year-old leader , who served as the archbishop of Buenos Aires , is the first pope to take the name in honor of St. Francis of Assisi , revered among Catholics for his work with the poor .
The pontiff is a follower of the church 's most social conservative wing . As a cardinal , he clashed with the government of Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner over his opposition to gay marriage and free distribution of contraceptives .
He was runner-up in the 2005 papal conclave , behind then-Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger .
The new pope brings together the first and the developing worlds . Latin America is home to 480 million Catholics .
Francis ' first public appearance as pope -- when he appealed for the crowds to pray for him before he gave a blessing -- suggested a `` different pastoral style '' in comparison with the more academic approach of Benedict , said Lombardi .
Francis is someone who has had `` a day-to-day link with the population and ordinary people '' during his many years at the head of a large diocese in Buenos Aires , he said .
He also sought to dampen concerns prompted by media reports that the new pope has only one lung .
Although Francis had part of one lung removed when he was a young man , the whole lung was not removed and the new pope is in good health , Lombardi said .
CNN iReporter Cesar Sotolongo in Lima , Peru , said the election of a Latin American pope , particularly from the Jesuit order , marked `` a new chapter '' for the Catholic Church .
Originally from Florida , Sotolongo also has his own advice for Francis : `` The pope should shape the church with what he has been doing during his career ( as an example ) , '' he said . `` Stay in contact with the people , communicate clearly , promote the unification of faith and ... represent the word of Jesus . ''
Born in Buenos Aires to an Italian immigrant father , Francis is known for his simplicity .
Details given by Lombardi on Thursday of Francis ' first hours as pope reinforce that impression -- one which may go down well with his global flock , many of whom live in poverty or are feeling the squeeze of austerity .
Francis stood , rather than sitting on a throne , to receive the oath of allegiance from his fellow cardinals after his election , and for his appearance on the balcony wore just a white cassock and a simple cross , eschewing gold or jewels , Lombardi said .
Also , on the ride back from the Sistine Chapel to the Santa Marta residence , he declined the papal car that had been prepared for him and instead took the bus with other cardinals , Lombardi said .
And Francis thanked the other cardinals at dinner , joking , `` May God forgive you for what you have done , '' Lombardi said .
Francis will remove the seals from the official papal apartments Thursday but will not move in until renovations are complete , he added . The new pontiff will live in a suite at the Santa Marta residence until the papal apartments are ready .
In Buenos Aires , Francis chose to live in an apartment rather than the archbishop 's palace , passed on a chauffeured limousine , took the bus to work and cooked his own meals .
He was ordained by the Jesuits in 1969 . He became co-archbishop of Buenos Aires in 1997 and sole archbishop of that city one year later .
He was made a cardinal in 2001 and served as president of the Argentine bishops conference from 2005 to 2011 .
As a Jesuit , Francis is a member of the Society of Jesus , one of the biggest and most important orders in the church .
Jesuits are recognized for their exceptional educational institutions and focus on social justice .
`` Jesuits are characterized by their service to the church ... but trying to avoid positions of power , '' said Lombardi , the Vatican spokesman , who is also a Jesuit . `` I am absolutely convinced that we have a pope who wants to serve .
`` His election was the election of a rejection of power . ''
His selection of the name of Pope Francis is `` the most stunning '' choice and `` precedent shattering , '' CNN Vatican analyst John Allen said . `` The new pope is sending a signal that this will not be business as usual . ''
The name symbolizes `` poverty , humility , simplicity and rebuilding the Catholic Church , '' Allen said .
Miguel Diaz , a former U.S. ambassador to the Holy See , agreed , calling the new pontiff 's choice of names `` very significant . ''
`` Francis of Assisi is the saint who opted for the little ones in God 's kingdom , '' he said . `` This man represents a change and could potentially be a great gift for leadership , servant leadership , for all of us within the church and society . ''
It is something the Catholic Church says it desperately needs .
`` If you look back over the past years -- the crisis of abuse , the scandals here at the Vatican , financial mismanagement , questions about the leaks and everything -- when you step back from it all , every crisis we faced ultimately is a crisis of holiness that we 've missed the calling , '' said the Rev . Thomas Rosica , the Vatican 's deputy spokesman .
`` We 've moved far away from what we 're supposed to be . ''
Word of the election of Pope Francis , who was not considered a frontrunner among analysts , quickly spread around the globe , with everyone from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to U.S. President Barack Obama offering congratulations .
`` As the first pope from the Americas , his selection also speaks to the strength and vitality of a region that is increasingly shaping our world , and alongside millions of Hispanic Americans , those of us in the United States share the joy of this historic day , '' Obama said .
Ban said the new pope shares common goals with the United Nations , from the promotion of peace to social justice . `` We also share the conviction that we can only resolve the interconnected challenges of today 's world through dialogue , '' he said .
There is likely to be no shortage of invitations for Pope Francis to travel to the four corners of the globe in the pursuit of such goals .
Syria 's Patriarch Gregory III Laham of Antioch , who heads the Melkite Greek Catholic Church , on Thursday invited Francis to visit Syria , Jerusalem and Lebanon for peace and reconciliation , according to Syria 's official news agency .
Israeli President Shimon Peres and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas also urged him to visit the Middle East .
`` He 'll be a welcome guest in the Holy Land , as a man of inspiration that can add to the attempt to bring peace in a stormy area , '' said Peres .
Nowhere was the reaction to Francis ' selection as pope more heartfelt than in Latin America .
`` I am truly still very surprised ... not just that a Latino pope came out , but that he is an Argentinian from Buenos Aires , '' the Rev . Eduardo Mangiarotti , an Argentine priest , told CNN en Español .
It 's a `` huge event '' not only for the church in Latin America but worldwide , he said .
Cardinal Theodore McCarrick , archbishop emeritus of Washington , greeted the selection with `` extraordinary joy . ''
`` I have been hoping that we would move into the Southern Hemisphere , and especially I think many of us had hoped ... we would have a pope who would come from Latin America , '' he said .
`` One-half of the Catholics in the world are from Latin America , so this is a way the cardinals have very graciously acknowledged that . ''
Filipino priest and CNN iReporter Joel Camaya was among the tens of thousands who witnessed history Wednesday night in St. Peter 's Square , as Francis emerged on the balcony .
`` The multitude , from all parts of the world , were ecstatic to be in the square for this beautiful occasion , '' he said . `` This was one event that left me teary-eyed and thanking God for making me a Catholic .

""As the first pope from the Americas, his selection also speaks to the strength and vitality of a region that is increasingly shaping our world, and alongside millions of Hispanic Americans, those of us in the United States share the joy of this historic day,"" Obama said.

Ban said the new pope shares common goals with the United Nations, from the promotion of peace to social justice. ""We also share the conviction that we can only resolve the interconnected challenges of today's world through dialogue,"" he said.

There is likely to be no shortage of invitations for Pope Francis to travel to the four corners of the globe in the pursuit of such goals.

Syria's Patriarch Gregory III Laham of Antioch, who heads the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, on Thursday invited Francis to visit Syria, Jerusalem and Lebanon for peace and reconciliation, according to Syria's official news agency.

Israeli President Shimon Peres and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas also urged him to visit the Middle East.

""He'll be a welcome guest in the Holy Land, as a man of inspiration that can add to the attempt to bring peace in a stormy area,"" said Peres.

Nowhere was the reaction to Francis' selection as pope more heartfelt than in Latin America.

""I am truly still very surprised ... not just that a Latino pope came out, but that he is an Argentinian from Buenos Aires,"" the Rev. Eduardo Mangiarotti, an Argentine priest, told CNN en Español.

It's a ""huge event"" not only for the church in Latin America but worldwide, he said.

Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, archbishop emeritus of Washington, greeted the selection with ""extraordinary joy.""

""I have been hoping that we would move into the Southern Hemisphere, and especially I think many of us had hoped ... we would have a pope who would come from Latin America,"" he said.

""One-half of the Catholics in the world are from Latin America, so this is a way the cardinals have very graciously acknowledged that.""

Filipino priest and CNN iReporter Joel Camaya was among the tens of thousands who witnessed history Wednesday night in St. Peter's Square, as Francis emerged on the balcony.

""The multitude, from all parts of the world, were ecstatic to be in the square for this beautiful occasion,"" he said. ""This was one event that left me teary-eyed and thanking God for making me a Catholic.""",www.cnn.com,left,eS972uk3nWLdzWM0

The pope 's declarations on poverty and economic justice may have been a new turn for the church , but the rest of the 84-page document was a regurgitation of the same old doctrine .
Specifically , the church 's hard line on abortion and other issues of reproductive justice remains as rigid and as dangerous as ever . Which is why the timing of the American Civil Liberty Union 's lawsuit alleging gross medical negligence against the United States Congress of Catholic Bishops , filed just days after the pope released his `` Evangelii Gaudium , '' felt significant . The suit was a necessary reminder that a church doctrine that refuses to respect women 's bodily autonomy and the medical judgment of doctors -- no matter how progressive its economic agenda -- is still a dangerous thing . ( Related : Economic justice and reproductive justice are not distinct agendas , but I digress . )
The lawsuit was filed on behalf of Tamesha Means , a 27-year-old mother of two who presented at the emergency room of a Catholic hospital in Michigan -- the only hospital within 30 miles -- after her water broke while she was 18 weeks pregnant . According to the suit , Means ' fetus had virtually no chance of survival , but the hospital did not tell her this information , nor did it tell her that the safest treatment option would be to induce labor in order to terminate the doomed pregnancy .
Instead , she says she was sent home with Tylenol . When she returned later that same night , bleeding and with an elevated temperature , she says the hospital attempted to send her home a second time . Means experienced a painful miscarriage while the hospital staff was in the process of filing her discharge papers . ( Mercy Health Muskegon has declined to comment . )
“ Each time I went into the hospital , the same thing happened , ” Means said in a statement . “ They should act like it ’ s their mother or sister or daughter they ’ re treating . I pray to God someone stops this from happening again . My life could have been taken . I was in a very dangerous situation . ”
Notice that Means said she prays that this does n't happen to anyone else . She is part of a growing number of people of faith who believe that the Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services -- the religious guidelines that dictate what care can and can not be administered in a Catholic hospital -- are dangerously at odds with quality medical care .
The movement against the religious directives enforced at Catholic hospitals includes many Catholics who want comprehensive healthcare for themselves and their neighbors -- without interference from American bishops or the Vatican .
`` Most people are shocked to learn about the impact that the bishops have on everyday healthcare , and that absolutely includes healthcare that takes place at Catholic hospitals , '' Meghan Smith , a domestic program associate at progressive advocacy group Catholics for Choice , told ███ .
And while the bishops may govern the care available at Catholic hospitals , the American public pays for it . These hospitals benefit from significant amounts of public funding , including state and federal grants for Title X family planning programs , Medicare and Medicaid . Despite receiving public subsidies , Catholic hospitals regularly deny basic reproductive health services based on religious directives that openly defy medical best practice . Giving bishops with zero medical expertise this kind of discretionary authority is dangerous for patients , dangerous for doctors and an outrageous overstep to many Catholics .
`` There are 68 million Catholics in the United States , and only 250 of them are bishops , '' Smith continued . `` The vast majority of Catholics disagree with the bishops on sex , sexuality and reproductive healthcare . ''
Not only do a majority of Catholics disagree with their church 's absolutes on issues like contraception and abortion care , they tend to disregard them entirely . Around 98 percent of sexually active Catholic women have at some point in their lives used a form of birth control that the Vatican does not approve of , and they have abortions at the same rate as other groups of women , around 28 percent . Recent data also reveals that 65 percent of Catholics believe that hospitals and clinics that receive public money should not be allowed to deny medical services based on religious doctrine , and 68 percent of Catholic women do n't want a Catholic hospital to be the only medical care option in their communities .
All of which explains why so many Catholics are pushing back against the expansion of Catholic hospitals , which currently serve one in six people seeking medical attention . In Baltimore last year , a group of Catholic doctors led protests against the University of Maryland Medical System 's merger with a Catholic hospital , explaining that it was because of their faith -- not in spite of it -- that they wanted their community hospital to provide comprehensive care to all patients , including birth control , miscarriage management and abortion care . In a letter opposing the partnership , the group wrote , `` Our faith 's call for social justice for all ... compels us to speak out against the disproportionate impact the continued influence that the [ American bishops ' ] directives ... would have on our neighbors . ''
Catholic legislators in Louisville , Ky. , were also among the loudest voices opposing a Catholic hospital merger with their local hospital , explaining that a partnership with a Catholic Health Initiatives-affiliate would mean less care for the people of Louisville , who , they said , `` have a right to be worried '' about religious doctrine interfering with their care .
`` St. Mary 's is a division of Catholic Health Initiatives , which means the hospital will soon be playing by different rules , '' wrote Rep. Thomas J. Burch and Rep. Mary Lou Marzian in an editorial opposing the merger . `` The Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services govern Catholic-owned or affiliated institutions , including hospitals , and they follow a different calculus for patients ' treatment . According to Michael Rowan , executive vice president of Catholic Health Initiatives , the merger 'will mean greater access to care . ' In reality , the directives will assure women less access to reproductive health care . ''
Like the doctors in Baltimore and Louisville , many Catholics ground their support for comprehensive healthcare -- and opposition to the expansion of Catholic hospitals that enforce the bishops ' directives -- directly in their faith . `` When Catholic hospitals are n't providing the services that a community needs , they are not providing the services that Catholics want , '' Smith explained .
Talk to a rank-and-file Catholic , and they will likely tell you the same thing . Judith Ceja , a Catholic nurse from Queens , N.Y. ( who also happens to be my aunt ) , told ███ , `` Every woman has a right to make a decision about her body , and the right to safe medical care . There is no church , no man , no president to stand in the way of that .
`` The Catholic Church , the way it is now , if we do n't come to terms with our doctrine , we are going to lose people , '' she continued . `` People will practice Catholicism -- they will practice their faith to be good kind people -- but they will not be going to church . ''
And she 's right . Only 41 percent of American Catholics attend Mass regularly , and that number drops to 30 percent among younger Catholics , who are increasingly at odds with the entrenched positions of church leadership .
When asked if she believed her views on reproductive rights make her any less of a Catholic , Ceja responded with a definitive `` no . ''

The latest twist started to unravel in October when Pope Francis ordered Swiss Guard gendarmes to raid the Holy See ’ s Financial Information Authority ( AIF ) office inside Vatican City , carrying out boxes of papers and computer hard drives . They tacked up what amounted to a “ Wanted Dead or Alive ” sign on the Vatican ’ s fortified gates to keep out the administrators while they started sifting through reams of curious expenditures in the Vatican ’ s financial books .
They came up with quite a few surprises about the way money donated for the poor was being used , including some dubious real estate interests , connections to an even more dubious Maltese financier , and investments in movies that , good or bad , don ’ t exactly square with church doctrine .
One of the more peculiar items on the spreadsheet was property on Sloane Avenue in London . It included luxury apartments in a former Harrods warehouse . The Vatican press office said at the time further investigations would be “ carried out over time . ”
Among the latest of those investigations is a tie to the Centurion Global Fund based in Malta , which has proven itself to be a hotbed of corruption . The Maltese prime minister is currently spending most of his time blockaded in his office in Valletta while angry protesters demand he resign over his alleged ties to the assassination of anti-corruption journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia two years ago .
“ While investing in mainstream entertainment is hardly sinful , the great contradiction is that the Catholic Church preaches to the devout that homosexuality is a sin . ”
At least two-thirds of the Centurion Global Fund ’ s capital assets are fed by the Vatican Secretariat of State , under which the Vatican financial authority operated , according to documents seen by Corriere Della Sera newspaper in Italy . The fund is run by Enrico Crasso , a 71-year-old Italian with a Swiss fiscal address who also runs Sogenel Holding , referred to as a “ reference point ” for key financial transactions for the Vatican Bank .
Crasso ’ s office walls are lined with personal letters signed by various Vatican secretaries of state and he has even been awarded a gold medal of merit from the pope . He alone decides how the Vatican money–about $ 78 million–entrusted to him through the Malta fund is spent to get the highest return .
The documents seen by Corriere Della Sera list his recent investments with the church ’ s money . Among them are around $ 2.2 million in a company called Italian Independent , run by Fiat founder Gianni Agnelli ’ s flamboyant grandson Lapo Elkann , who was arrested in New York in 2017 for faking his own kidnapping , allegedly to pay off a drug debt owed to a male escort .
Another $ 11 million went to an Italian businessman named Enrico Preziosi , who is an entrepreneur who owns the Genoa soccer team and who was caught up in a little legal trouble in the early 2000s for manipulating the price of soccer players to falsify accounting . He was fined around $ 15,000 and banned from soccer for four months .

But the most curious item on the report to come out so far is a $ 4.5 million expenditure recorded in February of this year related to finance for the 2019 films Men in Black : International and Elton John ’ s rather steamy biopic Rocketman , which portrays the entertainer ’ s drug problems and is the first studio movie to portray gay sex between men in an authentic way .

The money that feeds the Centurion Fund reportedly comes from investments made by the pope ’ s “ Peter ’ s Pence ” charity , which is fed by global dioceses that collect the money specifically for the poor on one given day of the year , often the last Sunday in June which is close to the feast days of saints Peter and Paul .
Peter ’ s Pence is not part of a local church ’ s Sunday collection basket , but a separate collection earmarked specifically for the papal fund . According to the charity ’ s website , the money is supposed to be channeled directly to the poor .
“ The Peter ’ s Pence collection is a gesture of solidarity , ” the site states . “ Through it , every member of the faithful can participate in the Pope ’ s activity . It is an activity that supports the most needy and ecclesial communities in difficulty who approach the Apostolic See for help . ”
Wednesday , the Wall Street Journal reported that the fund , which brings in more than $ 55 million annually and is worth about $ 700 million to date , is also spent on filling the gaps in the Vatican ’ s internal administrative budget . The paper alleges that just 10 percent is spent on charitable works , according to documentation it obtained .

religion_and_faith,Fox Online News,2,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/03/14/world-watches-as-cardinals-convene-for-2nd-day-papal-conclave/,Argentine Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio named new pope,2013-03-14,,"Pope Francis held his first mass as leader of the Catholic Church Thursday , urging cardinals that the church should stick to its roots and avoid modern temptations .
In his first homily at the Sistine Chapel , Jorge Mario Bergoglio , the 76-year-old Argentine cardinal who was elected pope by his peers on Wednesday , warned that the church risked becoming a `` pitiful '' non-governmental organization unless it goes through spiritual renewal and focuses on the message of Jesus Christ , Sky News reports .
`` If we do not confess to Christ what would we be ? '' Francis said . `` We would end up a pitiful NGO . What would happen would be like when children make sand castles and then it all falls down . ''
Francis and all the cardinals in attendance wore light yellow robes over their cassocks , while the new pope spoke in Italian without notes .
Earlier Thursday , Francis stopped by his hotel to pick up his luggage and pay the bill himself and praying at Rome 's main basilica dedicated to the Virgin Mary .
More On This ... Pope Francis : The new leader of the Catholic Church
He entered the St. Mary Major basilica through a side entrance just after 8 a.m. and left about 30 minutes later .
`` He spoke to us cordially , like a father , '' Father Ludovico Melo , a priest who prayed with Pope Francis , told Reuters . `` We were given 10 minutes ' advance notice that the pope was coming . ''
After becoming the first pontiff from the Americans , Francis had told a crowd of some 100,000 people packed in rain-soaked St. Peter 's Square just after his election that he intended to pray Friday to the Madonna `` that she may watch over all of Rome . ''
Bergoglio chose the name Francis , drawing connections to the humble 13th-century saint who saw his calling as trying to rebuild the church in a time of turmoil .
Benedict 's longtime aide , Monsignor Georg Gaenswein , accompanied Francis to the visit Thursday morning at St. Mary Major . In addition to being Benedict 's secretary , Gaenswein is also the prefect of the papal household and will be arranging the new pope 's schedule .
Like many Latin American Catholics , Francis has a particular devotion to the Virgin Mary , and his visit to the basilica was a reflection of that . He prayed before a Byzantine icon of Mary and the infant Jesus , the Protectress of the Roman People .
`` He had a great devotion to this icon of Mary and every time he comes from Argentina he visits this basilica , '' said one of the priests at the basilica , the Rev . Elio Montenero . `` We were surprised today because he did not announce his visit . ''
He then went into the main altar area of the basilica and prayed before relics of the manger in Bethlehem where Jesus is said to have been born — an important pilgrimage spot for Jesuits .
Members of his flock were charmed Thursday when Francis stopped by the Vatican-owned residence where he routinely stays during visits to Rome .
The Rev . Pawel Rytel-Andrianek , who teaches at the nearby Pontifical Holy Cross University and is staying at the residence , said he did n't just come to get his luggage , noting that anyone could have come to get his suitcases .
`` He wanted to come here because he wanted to thank the personnel , people who work in this house , '' he said . Francis met with the staff in the dining room . `` He greeted them one by one , no rush , the whole staff , one by one , '' Rytel-Andrianek said , noting that the pope knew everyone by name .
`` People say that he never in these 20 years asked for a ( Vatican ) car , '' he said . `` Even when he went for the conclave with a priest from his diocese , he just walked out to the main road , he picked up a taxi and went to the conclave . So very simple for a future pope . ''
Francis has also spoken by phone with Benedict , who became the first pope to resign in 600 years and has been living at the papal retreat in Castel Gandolfo . Francis was expected to visit him this week , but a Vatican spokesman , the Rev . Thomas Rosica , said Francis would n't make the trip to Castel Gandolfo on Thursday , and probably would n't go Friday , either .
The visit is significant because Benedict 's resignation has raised concerns about potential power conflicts emerging from the peculiar situation of having a reigning pope and a retired one .
As the long-time archbishop of Buenos Aires , Francis has spent nearly his entire career at home in Argentina , overseeing churches and shoe-leather priests . In choosing a 76-year-old pope , the cardinals clearly decided that they did n't need a vigorous , young pope who would reign for decades but rather a seasoned , popular and humble pastor who would draw followers to the faith and help rebuild a church stained by scandal .
Groups of supporters waved Argentine flags Wednesday night in St. Peter 's Square as Francis , wearing simple white robes , made his first public appearance as pope .
Chants of `` Long live the pope ! '' arose from the throngs of faithful , many with tears in their eyes . Crowds went wild as the Vatican and Italian military bands marched through the square and up the steps of the basilica , followed by Swiss Guards in silver helmets and full regalia .
Francis appeared on the balcony of St. Peter 's Basilica just after a church official announced `` Habemus Papum '' -- `` We have a pope '' -- and gave Bergoglio 's name in Latin .

Now , a Latin American Jesuit has been elected head of the 1.2-billion strong Catholic Church .","Pope Francis held his first mass as leader of the Catholic Church Thursday, urging cardinals that the church should stick to its roots and avoid modern temptations.

In his first homily at the Sistine Chapel, Jorge Mario Bergoglio, the 76-year-old Argentine cardinal who was elected pope by his peers on Wednesday, warned that the church risked becoming a ""pitiful"" non-governmental organization unless it goes through spiritual renewal and focuses on the message of Jesus Christ, Sky News reports.

""If we do not confess to Christ what would we be?"" Francis said. ""We would end up a pitiful NGO. What would happen would be like when children make sand castles and then it all falls down.""

Francis and all the cardinals in attendance wore light yellow robes over their cassocks, while the new pope spoke in Italian without notes.

Earlier Thursday, Francis stopped by his hotel to pick up his luggage and pay the bill himself and praying at Rome's main basilica dedicated to the Virgin Mary.

He entered the St. Mary Major basilica through a side entrance just after 8 a.m. and left about 30 minutes later.

""He spoke to us cordially, like a father,"" Father Ludovico Melo, a priest who prayed with Pope Francis, told Reuters. ""We were given 10 minutes' advance notice that the pope was coming.""

After becoming the first pontiff from the Americans, Francis had told a crowd of some 100,000 people packed in rain-soaked St. Peter's Square just after his election that he intended to pray Friday to the Madonna ""that she may watch over all of Rome.""

Bergoglio chose the name Francis, drawing connections to the humble 13th-century saint who saw his calling as trying to rebuild the church in a time of turmoil.

Benedict's longtime aide, Monsignor Georg Gaenswein, accompanied Francis to the visit Thursday morning at St. Mary Major. In addition to being Benedict's secretary, Gaenswein is also the prefect of the papal household and will be arranging the new pope's schedule.

Like many Latin American Catholics, Francis has a particular devotion to the Virgin Mary, and his visit to the basilica was a reflection of that. He prayed before a Byzantine icon of Mary and the infant Jesus, the Protectress of the Roman People.

""He had a great devotion to this icon of Mary and every time he comes from Argentina he visits this basilica,"" said one of the priests at the basilica, the Rev. Elio Montenero. ""We were surprised today because he did not announce his visit.""

He then went into the main altar area of the basilica and prayed before relics of the manger in Bethlehem where Jesus is said to have been born — an important pilgrimage spot for Jesuits.

Members of his flock were charmed Thursday when Francis stopped by the Vatican-owned residence where he routinely stays during visits to Rome.

The Rev. Pawel Rytel-Andrianek, who teaches at the nearby Pontifical Holy Cross University and is staying at the residence, said he didn't just come to get his luggage, noting that anyone could have come to get his suitcases.

""He wanted to come here because he wanted to thank the personnel, people who work in this house,"" he said. Francis met with the staff in the dining room. ""He greeted them one by one, no rush, the whole staff, one by one,"" Rytel-Andrianek said, noting that the pope knew everyone by name.

""People say that he never in these 20 years asked for a (Vatican) car,"" he said. ""Even when he went for the conclave with a priest from his diocese, he just walked out to the main road, he picked up a taxi and went to the conclave. So very simple for a future pope.""

Francis has also spoken by phone with Benedict, who became the first pope to resign in 600 years and has been living at the papal retreat in Castel Gandolfo. Francis was expected to visit him this week, but a Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Thomas Rosica, said Francis wouldn't make the trip to Castel Gandolfo on Thursday, and probably wouldn't go Friday, either.

The visit is significant because Benedict's resignation has raised concerns about potential power conflicts emerging from the peculiar situation of having a reigning pope and a retired one.

As the long-time archbishop of Buenos Aires, Francis has spent nearly his entire career at home in Argentina, overseeing churches and shoe-leather priests. In choosing a 76-year-old pope, the cardinals clearly decided that they didn't need a vigorous, young pope who would reign for decades but rather a seasoned, popular and humble pastor who would draw followers to the faith and help rebuild a church stained by scandal.

Groups of supporters waved Argentine flags Wednesday night in St. Peter's Square as Francis, wearing simple white robes, made his first public appearance as pope.

Chants of ""Long live the pope!"" arose from the throngs of faithful, many with tears in their eyes. Crowds went wild as the Vatican and Italian military bands marched through the square and up the steps of the basilica, followed by Swiss Guards in silver helmets and full regalia.

Francis appeared on the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica just after a church official announced ""Habemus Papum"" -- ""We have a pope"" -- and gave Bergoglio's name in Latin.

""Ladies and Gentlemen, good evening,"" he said to wild cheers before making a reference to his roots in Latin America, which accounts for about 40 percent of the world's Roman Catholics.

Francis asked for prayers for himself, and for retired Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, whose resignation paved the way for the conclave that brought the first Jesuit to the papacy.

""You know that the work of the conclave is to give a bishop to Rome,"" Francis said. ""It seems as if my brother cardinals went to find him from the end of the earth. Thank you for the welcome.""

Bergoglio has shown a keen political sensibility as well as the kind of self-effacing humility that fellow cardinals value highly, according to his official biographer, Sergio Rubin. He showed that humility on Wednesday, saying that before he blessed the crowd he wanted their prayers for him and bowed his head.

""Good night, and have a good rest,"" he said before going back into the palace.

In a lifetime of teaching and leading priests in Latin America, which has the largest share of the world's Catholics, Francis has been known for modernizing an Argentine church that had been among the most conservative in Latin America.

Like other Jesuit intellectuals, Bergoglio has focused on social outreach. Catholics are still buzzing over his speech last year accusing fellow church officials of hypocrisy for forgetting that Jesus Christ bathed lepers and ate with prostitutes.

Francis, the son of middle-class Italian immigrants, is known as a humble man who denied himself the luxuries that previous Buenos Aires cardinals enjoyed. Bergoglio often rode the bus to work, cooked his own meals and regularly visited the slums that ring Argentina's capital.

He came close to becoming pope in 2005, reportedly gaining the second-highest vote total in several rounds of voting before he bowed out of the running in the conclave that elected Pope Benedict XVI.

American Cardinal Timothy Dolan gave an inside glimpse into the drama of the conclave in his talk at the American seminary.

When the tally reached the necessary 77 votes to make Bergoglio pope, Dolan said, the cardinals erupted in applause. And when he accepted the momentous responsibility thrust upon him -- ''there wasn't a dry eye in the place,"" Dolan recounted.

Pope Francis has hinted that the use of contraception by women at risk of contracting the Zika virus may be permissible.

The pontiff insisted that abortion remained a crime but said avoiding pregnancy was ""not an absolute evil"".

His remarks came in response to a question about how best to tackle the Zika outbreak across Latin America.

The virus has been linked to the microcephaly birth defects in babies, which can cause development problems.

Roman Catholic teachings currently ban the use of contraception.

""We must not confuse the evil consisting of avoiding a pregnancy with abortion,"" Pope Francis told reporters on a flight returning home from a visit to Mexico.

""Abortion is not a theological problem. It is a human problem, medical. One person is killed to save another. It is evil in itself, it is not a religious evil, it is a human evil,"" he said.

Analysis - Caroline Wyatt, Religious Affairs Correspondent

The Pope's comments about avoiding pregnancy in areas where the Zika virus is prevalent are an immensely significant moment. While he does not specifically condone artificial contraception, which is against Roman Catholic teaching, he appears to signal an unexpected openness to the idea if used in order to prevent further infection.

Asked directly whether the Church would consider it permissible to use contraceptives in order to prevent transmission of Zika, Pope Francis said that in some cases the ""lesser of two evils"" could be applied and spoke of example of Blessed Paul VI, a Pope in the early 1960s who allowed nuns in Africa to use birth control in order to prevent them conceiving children from rape.

That leaves the door open to Catholic families in affected areas to follow their own consciences on the matter. However, the Pope made abundantly clear that abortion remained ""a crime, an absolute evil,"" while birth control was not an ""absolute"" evil.

Scientists said on Thursday that links between the Zika virus and microcephaly have been strengthened by a study involving pregnant women in Brazil.

The research confirmed the presence of Zika virus in the amniotic fluid of two women who had had Zika-like symptoms during their pregnancies.

Brazilian experts say this suggests the virus can infect the foetus. But World Health Organisation experts caution the link is not proven and expect to release more information in the next few weeks.

The United Nations and aid organisations have urged countries hit by the virus to ensure women have access to contraception to reduce the risk of infection and the right to abortion should they decide to terminate a pregnancy.

Many Latin American countries outlaw abortion or allow it only if the mother's life is in danger.

After initially saying little about the outbreak, Catholic leaders in the region had recently begun to assert the Church's opposition to what it terms ""artificial"" birth control and abortion.

According to Bishop Curry , the welcome his family found decades ago at the Episcopal Church , which is 83 percent white , set into motion his own journey toward the priesthood , when his mother was handed the same communion chalice as the white parishioners .
Curry 's father `` was dumbfounded , '' he told worshippers at Sunday 's ceremony . `` Years later , he would say he joined the Episcopal Church because he really had n't imagined that could happen in America . He said any church where blacks and whites drink out of the same cup knows something about the Gospel I want to be a part of . ''
Curry vowed to continue his predecessor 's work towards social justice and racial reconciliation : In 2008 , for example , Bishop Jefferts Schori presided at a two-day service to `` publicly apologize for [ the church 's ] involvement in the institution of Transatlantic Slavery . ''
The Episcopal Church is hardly alone in seeking what Christin Taylor , writing for the liberal Christian magazine `` Sojourners , '' called `` The White Church 's Second Chance . '' In the sudden intensification of racial social justice efforts following tragedies in Ferguson , Mo. , Baltimore , Md. , and many others , some traditionally white congregations see an opportunity to right wrongs that they say they have failed to address in the past .
Christianity has a decidedly mixed past , and possibly present , when it comes to racial justice : throughout the abolitionist movement , Civil War , and Reconstruction , for instance , pro- and anti-slavery Christians alike used Bible verses to support their positions .
Ms. Taylor shares her surprise , and pain , to realize that Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. 's famous `` Letter from Birmingham Jail , '' describing the urgency of change for African Americans , was written from the Baptist minister to fellow men of faith .
`` I felt that the white ministers , priests , and rabbis of the South would be some of our strongest allies , '' Dr. King wrote , yet too many `` have remained silent behind the anesthetizing security of stained-glass windows . ''
As recently as 2011 , Harvard professor Michael I. Norton found that white Americans ' perceptions of racial injustice differed sharply from those of blacks ' , with many whites believing it was largely a thing of the past . As The New York Times put it , many of Norton 's white respondents ' views `` diverge far from reality '' on issues such as equal pay and health disparities .
But that may be changing : in August , WBBM-TV News in Chicago reported on a poll that showed 44 percent of white Americans consider racism to be `` a major problem . '' In 2010 , that number was just 27 percent .
`` We voted on if we were going to put a Black Lives Matter sign on our lawn and it was the first unanimous vote in our church 's memory , '' Evanston , Il . Unitarian Church Rev . Bret Lortie told CBS .
Majority-white churches across the country have staked Black Lives Matter banners in their yards . In numerous cases , however , they return to find the signs vandalized — frequently with the word `` Black '' covered up — or face harassment online , reported UU World , the magazine of the Unitarian Universalist Association .
So many congregations across the denominational spectrum have reported backlash that the Unitarian Universalist Association provides an online resource for churches who find themselves targeted .
The harassment is intimidating , especially for congregations not used to entering social-political fray , but `` the experience of having a sign vandalized is only a passing glimpse of the terror of living as a person of color in a racist society , '' Rev . Jake Morrill , of Oak Ridge UU Church in Tennessee , told UU World 's Joshua Eaton . `` It was important to me that our congregation not adopt the stance of victim when our sign was vandalized . Our congregation 's welfare is not the point of Black Lives Matter . ''
Baltimore Rev . Dr. Jamal Bryant told the Huffington Post that he believes the movement has brought churches back into the `` larger community , '' where he thinks Jesus would have wanted it . `` Much of what Jesus did didn ’ t happen in the temple , '' he pointed out .

While protests and banners may signal churches ' commitment , they 're just a start . Earlier this month , the Episcopal Church organized a `` pilgrimage '' for young adults to Ferguson , Mo. , where they would spend their time on `` holy ground '' to brainstorm advocacy projects to bring back to their own communities .
`` It is incumbent on us , if we are to create a new future , to engage the past , '' Curry said during his tenure as the Bishop of North Carolina . Congregations must","Declaring that ""God has work for us to do,"" Bishop Michael Curry was installed as the Episcopal Church's first black leader Monday at the Washington National Cathedral, accepting the ceremonial crozier from outgoing Presiding Bishop Katharine Jefferts Schori, the Church's first female leader.

According to Bishop Curry, the welcome his family found decades ago at the Episcopal Church, which is 83 percent white, set into motion his own journey toward the priesthood, when his mother was handed the same communion chalice as the white parishioners.

Curry's father ""was dumbfounded,"" he told worshippers at Sunday's ceremony. ""Years later, he would say he joined the Episcopal Church because he really hadn't imagined that could happen in America. He said any church where blacks and whites drink out of the same cup knows something about the Gospel I want to be a part of.""

Curry vowed to continue his predecessor's work towards social justice and racial reconciliation: In 2008, for example, Bishop Jefferts Schori presided at a two-day service to ""publicly apologize for [the church's] involvement in the institution of Transatlantic Slavery.""

The Episcopal Church is hardly alone in seeking what Christin Taylor, writing for the liberal Christian magazine ""Sojourners,"" called ""The White Church's Second Chance."" In the sudden intensification of racial social justice efforts following tragedies in Ferguson, Mo., Baltimore, Md., and many others, some traditionally white congregations see an opportunity to right wrongs that they say they have failed to address in the past.

Christianity has a decidedly mixed past, and possibly present, when it comes to racial justice: throughout the abolitionist movement, Civil War, and Reconstruction, for instance, pro- and anti-slavery Christians alike used Bible verses to support their positions.

Ms. Taylor shares her surprise, and pain, to realize that Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s famous ""Letter from Birmingham Jail,"" describing the urgency of change for African Americans, was written from the Baptist minister to fellow men of faith.

""I felt that the white ministers, priests, and rabbis of the South would be some of our strongest allies,"" Dr. King wrote, yet too many ""have remained silent behind the anesthetizing security of stained-glass windows.""

As recently as 2011, Harvard professor Michael I. Norton found that white Americans' perceptions of racial injustice differed sharply from those of blacks', with many whites believing it was largely a thing of the past. As The New York Times put it, many of Norton's white respondents' views ""diverge far from reality"" on issues such as equal pay and health disparities.

But that may be changing: in August, WBBM-TV News in Chicago reported on a poll that showed 44 percent of white Americans consider racism to be ""a major problem."" In 2010, that number was just 27 percent.

""We voted on if we were going to put a Black Lives Matter sign on our lawn and it was the first unanimous vote in our church's memory,"" Evanston, Il. Unitarian Church Rev. Bret Lortie told CBS.

Majority-white churches across the country have staked Black Lives Matter banners in their yards. In numerous cases, however, they return to find the signs vandalized — frequently with the word ""Black"" covered up — or face harassment online, reported UU World, the magazine of the Unitarian Universalist Association.

So many congregations across the denominational spectrum have reported backlash that the Unitarian Universalist Association provides an online resource for churches who find themselves targeted.

The harassment is intimidating, especially for congregations not used to entering social-political fray, but ""the experience of having a sign vandalized is only a passing glimpse of the terror of living as a person of color in a racist society,"" Rev. Jake Morrill, of Oak Ridge UU Church in Tennessee, told UU World's Joshua Eaton. ""It was important to me that our congregation not adopt the stance of victim when our sign was vandalized. Our congregation's welfare is not the point of Black Lives Matter.""

Baltimore Rev. Dr. Jamal Bryant told the Huffington Post that he believes the movement has brought churches back into the ""larger community,"" where he thinks Jesus would have wanted it. ""Much of what Jesus did didn’t happen in the temple,"" he pointed out.

The Southern Poverty Law Center ( SPLC ) recently released an in-depth report on terrorism in the United States . Covering April 2009 to February 2015 , the report ( titled “ The Age of the Wolf ” ) found that during that period , “ more people have been killed in America by non-Islamic domestic terrorists than jihadists. ” The SPLC asserted that “ the jihadist threat is a tremendous one , ” pointing out that al-Qaeda ’ s attacks of September 11 , 2001 remain the deadliest in U.S. history . But the study also noted that the second deadliest was carried out not by Islamists , but by Timothy McVeigh in Oklahoma City on April 19 , 1995—and law enforcement , the SPLC stressed , are doing the public a huge disservice if they view terrorism as an exclusively Islamist phenomenon .
The report , in a sense , echoed the assertions that President Barack Obama made when he spoke at the National Prayer Breakfast in February and stressed that Muslims don ’ t have the market cornered on religious extremism . In the minds of far-right Republicans , Obama committed the ultimate sin by daring to mention that Christianity has a dark side and citing the Crusades and the Spanish Inquisition as two examples from the distant past . Obama wasn ’ t attacking Christianity on the whole but rather , was making the point that just as not all Christians can be held responsible for the horrors of the Inquisition , not all Muslims can be blamed for the violent extremism of ISIS ( the Islamic State , Iraq and Syria ) , the Taliban , al-Qaeda or Boko Haram . But Obama certainly didn ’ t need to look 800 or 900 years in the past to find examples of extreme Christianists committing atrocities . Violent Christianists are a reality in different parts of the world—including the United States—and the fact that the mainstream media don ’ t give them as much coverage as ISIS or Boko Haram doesn ’ t mean that they don ’ t exist .
Below are six extreme Christianist groups that have shown their capacity for violence and fanaticism .
A network of violent Christianists that has been active since the early 1980s , the Army of God openly promotes killing abortion providers—and the long list of terrorists who have been active in that organization has included Paul Jennings Hill ( who was executed by lethal injection in 2003 for the 1994 killings of abortion doctor John Britton and his bodyguard James Barrett ) , John C. Salvi ( who killed two receptionists when he attacked a Planned Parenthood clinic in Brookline , Massachusetts in 1994 ) and Eric Rudolph , who is serving life in prison for his role in the Olympic Park bombing in Atlanta in 1996 and other terrorist acts . Rudolph , in fact , has often been exalted as a Christian hero on the Army of God ’ s website , as have fellow Army of God members such as Scott Roeder ( who is serving life without parole for murdering Wichita , Kansas-based abortion doctor George Tiller in 2009 ) , Shelley Shannon ( who attempted to kill Tiller in 2003 ) and Michael Frederick Griffin ( who is serving a life sentence for the 1993 killing of Dr. David Gunn , an OB-GYN , in Pensacola , Florida ) .
Although primarily an anti-abortion organization , the Army of God also has a history of promoting violence against gays . And one of the terrorist acts that Rudolph confessed to was bombing a lesbian bar in Atlanta in 1997 .
2 . Eastern Lightning , a.k.a . the Church of the Almighty God
Founded in Henan Province , China in 1990 , Eastern Lightning ( also known as the Church of the Almighty God or the Church of the Gospel ’ s Kingdom ) is a Christianist cult with an end-time/apocalypse focus : Eastern Lightning believes that the world is coming to an end , and in the meantime , its duty is to slay as many demons as possible . While most Christianists have an extremely patriarchal viewpoint ( much like their Islamist counterparts ) and consider women inferior to men , Eastern Lightning believe that Jesus Christ will return to Earth in the form of a Chinese woman . But they are quite capable of violence against women : in May 2014 , for example , members of the cult beat a 37-year-old woman named Wu Shuoyan to death in a McDonalds in Zhaoyuan , China when she refused to give them her phone number . Eastern Lightning members Zhang Lidong and his daughter , Zhang Fan , were convicted of murder for the crime and executed in February . In a 2014 interview in prison , Lidong expressed no remorse when he said of Shuoyan , “ I beat her with all my might and stamped on her too . She was a demon . We had to destroy her . ”
Eastern Lightning ’ s other acts of violence have ranged from the killing of a grammar school student in 2010 ( in retaliation , police believe , for one of the child ’ s relatives wanting to leave the cult ) to cult member Min Yongjun using a knife to attack an elderly woman and a group of schoolchildren in Chenpeng in 2012 . Christian groups are not exempt from Eastern Lightning ’ s fanaticism : in 2002 , cult members kidnapped 34 members of a Christian group called the China Gospel Fellowship and held them captive for two months in the hope of forcing them to join their cult . Although mainly active in the communist People ’ s Republic of China , Eastern Lighting has been trying to expand its membership in Hong Kong .
The mainstream media have had much to say about the Islamist brutality of Boko Haram , but one terrorist group they haven ’ t paid nearly as much attention to is the Lord ’ s Resistance Army—which was founded by Joseph Kony ( a radical Christianist ) in Uganda in 1987 and has called for the establishment of a severe Christian fundamentalist government in that country . The LRA , according to Human Rights Watch , has committed thousands of killings and kidnappings—and along the way , its terrorism spread from Uganda to parts of the Congo , the Central African Republic ( CAR ) and South Sudan . The word “ jihadist ” is seldom used in connection with the LRA , but in fact , the LRA ’ s tactics are not unlike those of ISIS or Boko Haram . And the governments Kony hopes to establish in Sub-Saharan Africa would implement a Christianist equivalent of Islamic Sharia law .
India is not only a country of Hindus and Sikhs , but also , of Muslims , Buddhists , Catholics and Protestants . Most of India ’ s Christians are peaceful , but a major exception is the National Liberation Front of Tripura ( NLFT ) . Active in the state of Tripura in Northeastern India since 1989 , NLFT is a paramilitary Christianist movement that hopes to secede from India and establish a Christian fundamentalist government in Tripura . NLFT has zero tolerance for any religion other than Christianity , and the group has repeatedly shown a willingness to kill , kidnap or torture Hindus who refuse to be converted to its extreme brand of Protestant fundamentalism .
In 2000 , NLFT vowed to kill anyone who participated in Durga Puja ( an annual Hindu festival ) And in May 2003 , at least 30 Hindus were murdered during one of NLFT ’ s killing sprees .
White supremacist groups don ’ t necessarily have a religious orientation : some of them welcome atheists as long as they believe in white superiority . But the Christian Identity movement specifically combines white supremacist ideology with Christianist terrorism , arguing that violence against non-WASPs is ordained by God and that white Anglo Saxon Protestants are God ’ s chosen people . The modern Christian Identity movement in the U.S. has been greatly influenced by the Ku Klux Klan—an organization that has committed numerous acts of terrorism over the years—and in the 1970s , new Christian Identity groups like the Aryan Nations and the Covenant , the Sword and the Arm of the Lord ( CSA ) emerged . Another Christian Identity group of recent decades has been the Phineas Priesthood , whose members have been involved in violent activities ranging from abortion clinic bombings to bank robberies ( mainly in the Pacific Northwest ) . On November 28 , 2014 , Phineas Priesthood member Larry Steven McQuilliams went on a violent rampage in Austin , Texas—where he fired over 100 rounds at various targets ( including a federal courthouse , the local Mexican Consulate building and a police station ) before being shot and killed by police .
One of the ironic things about some Christianists is the fact that although they believe that Jews must be converted to Christianity , they consider themselves staunch supporters of Israel . And some of them believe in violently forcing all Muslims out of Israel . The Concerned Christians , a Christianist doomsday cult that was founded by pastor Monte “ Kim ” Miller in Denver in the 1980s , alarmed Colorado residents when , in 1998 , at least 60 of its members suddenly quit their jobs , abandoned their homes and went missing—and it turned out there was reason for concern . In 1999 , Israeli officials arrested 14 members of the Concerned Christians in Jerusalem and deported them from Israel because they suspected them of plotting terrorist attacks against Muslims . One likely target , according to Israeli police , was Jerusalem ’ s al-Aqsa Mosque—the same mosque that was targeted in 1969 ( when a Christianist from Australia named Denis Michael Rohan unsuccessfully tried to destroy it by arson ) and , Israeli police suspect , was a likely target in 2014 ( when Adam Everett Livix , a Christianist from Texas , was arrested by Israeli police on suspicion of plotting to blow up Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem ) .
In 2008 , Denver ’ s KUSA-TV ( an NBC affiliate ) reported that members of the Concerned Citizens had gone into hiding and that Miller hadn ’ t been seen in ten years .","6 modern-day Christian terrorist groups our media conveniently ignores They don't get the coverage of ISIS or Boko Haram, but organizations like ""The Army of God"" are no less dangerous

Billy Graham , the world-renowned evangelist whose ministry changed the lives of hundreds of millions of people , has died at age 99 at his home in North Carolina .
Graham 's impact transformed America 's religious life and reached around the world . He eventually became a counselor to presidents and the most widely heard Christian evangelist in history .
Spokesman Mark DeMoss says Graham died at his home in North Carolina on Wednesday morning . Graham 's personal physician , Lucian Rice , said he did n't die of any particular illness , instead , `` he just wore out . '' But Graham wanted the world to know , he 's not really dead , he 's just moved to heaven .
This famous quote from Billy Graham sums up his perspective on eternity : “ Someday you will read or hear that Billy Graham is dead . Don ’ t you believe a word of it . I shall be more alive than I am now . I will just have changed my address . I will have gone into the presence of God . ''
William Franklin Graham was born November 7 , 1918 , four days before the end of World War I .
Raised on a dairy farm during the Great Depression , he developed a strong work ethic , a work ethic that was clearly evident through six decades of ministry .
Rev . Graham shared the gospel of Jesus Christ to nearly 215 million people in live audiences in more than 185 countries and territories .
Hundreds of millions more have been reached through radio , television , film , books and the internet .
Billy Graham gave his heart to Jesus Christ at 16 . His profound conversion happened under the ministry of traveling evangelist Mordecai Ham .
Answering God 's call to the ministry , he was ordained in 1939 by a church in the Southern Baptist Convention .
Four years later , he graduated from Wheaton College in Illinois , where he met and married his wife , Ruth .
`` All I remember is going back home and kneeling down that night and saying , Lord , if you 'd let me spend the rest of my life with that man , I would consider it the greatest privilege , '' Ruth Graham once said . `` And fortunately , I did n't know what I was praying . If I 'd known what lay ahead , I would n't have had the nerve to pray a prayer like that . ''
Billy Graham gained his primary evangelistic experience on radio , and then through Youth for Christ , an organization founded to minister to young people and servicemen during World War II .
Following the war , Graham preached throughout the United States and Europe .
His ministry with Youth for Christ opened doors for a series of interdenominational city-wide campaigns in the late 40s .
Graham 's Los Angeles Crusade in 1949 brought international recognition . Originally scheduled for three weeks , the meetings were extended to more than eight weeks .
`` In the city of Los Angeles , the largest tent ever erected for a revival meeting is now complete , '' the news media reported at the time .
The tent seated 6,500 people , and several thousand more stood around the sides .
Graham 's team established prayer chains throughout the city to intercede for the crusade .
One prayer warrior , known as Mrs. Edwards , felt a supernatural compulsion to call the legendary newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst and tell him about Billy Graham .
From that call , Hearst issued the now famous command , `` puff Graham , '' which means highly promote this man .
The Los Angeles crusade became front page news . That led to overflow crowds and extended runs for many of the crusades that followed .
One in London lasted 12 weeks , and a crusade in New York City ran for 16 weeks .

''","Rev. Billy Graham, the world-renowned evangelist whose ministry changed the lives of hundreds of millions of people, has died at age 99 at his home in North Carolina.

Graham's impact transformed America's religious life and reached around the world. He eventually became a counselor to presidents and the most widely heard Christian evangelist in history.

Spokesman Mark DeMoss says Graham died at his home in North Carolina on Wednesday morning. Graham's personal physician, Lucian Rice, said he didn't die of any particular illness, instead, ""he just wore out."" But Graham wanted the world to know, he's not really dead, he's just moved to heaven.

This famous quote from Billy Graham sums up his perspective on eternity: “Someday you will read or hear that Billy Graham is dead. Don’t you believe a word of it. I shall be more alive than I am now. I will just have changed my address. I will have gone into the presence of God.""

William Franklin Graham was born November 7, 1918, four days before the end of World War I.

Raised on a dairy farm during the Great Depression, he developed a strong work ethic, a work ethic that was clearly evident through six decades of ministry.

Rev. Graham shared the gospel of Jesus Christ to nearly 215 million people in live audiences in more than 185 countries and territories.

Hundreds of millions more have been reached through radio, television, film, books and the internet.

Billy Graham gave his heart to Jesus Christ at 16. His profound conversion happened under the ministry of traveling evangelist Mordecai Ham.

Answering God's call to the ministry, he was ordained in 1939 by a church in the Southern Baptist Convention.

Four years later, he graduated from Wheaton College in Illinois, where he met and married his wife, Ruth.

""All I remember is going back home and kneeling down that night and saying, Lord, if you'd let me spend the rest of my life with that man, I would consider it the greatest privilege,"" Ruth Graham once said. ""And fortunately, I didn't know what I was praying. If I'd known what lay ahead, I wouldn't have had the nerve to pray a prayer like that.""

Billy Graham gained his primary evangelistic experience on radio, and then through Youth for Christ, an organization founded to minister to young people and servicemen during World War II.

Following the war, Graham preached throughout the United States and Europe.

His ministry with Youth for Christ opened doors for a series of interdenominational city-wide campaigns in the late 40s.

Graham's Los Angeles Crusade in 1949 brought international recognition. Originally scheduled for three weeks, the meetings were extended to more than eight weeks.

""In the city of Los Angeles, the largest tent ever erected for a revival meeting is now complete,"" the news media reported at the time.

The tent seated 6,500 people, and several thousand more stood around the sides.

Graham's team established prayer chains throughout the city to intercede for the crusade.

One prayer warrior, known as Mrs. Edwards, felt a supernatural compulsion to call the legendary newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst and tell him about Billy Graham.

From that call, Hearst issued the now famous command, ""puff Graham,"" which means highly promote this man.

The Los Angeles crusade became front page news. That led to overflow crowds and extended runs for many of the crusades that followed.

One in London lasted 12 weeks, and a crusade in New York City ran for 16 weeks.

""Now I'm going to ask you to get up out of your seat, hundreds of you, men, women, young people,"" Graham preached in his powerful, familiar voice in that New York outreach.

Even gang members turned in their weapons at the New York crusade.

Green,"One of the more popular and enduring accounts of America ’ s past is that of its religious founding . Belief that the British-American colonies were settled largely by religiously devout people in search of spiritual freedom , that the United States government was founded in part on religious principles , that the Founders intended to create a “ Christian nation , ” and that America is a specially chosen nation whose success has been directed by divine providence has resonated in the national psyche for generations . Versions of this account have existed since the founding era and have persisted through times of national distress , trial , and triumph . They represent a leading theme in our nation ’ s historical narrative , frequently intertwined with expressions of patriotism and American exceptionalism .
Opinion polls indicate that many Americans hold vague , if not explicit , ideas about the nation ’ s religious foundings . According to a 2008 study by the First Amendment Center , over 50 percent of Americans believe that the U.S Constitution created a Christian nation , notwithstanding its express prohibitions on religious establishments and religious tests for public office holding . A similar study conducted by the Pew Forum on Religion in Public Life revealed even higher numbers , noting that “ Americans overwhelmingly consider the U.S. a Christian nation : Two-in-three ( 67 % ) characterize the nation this way. ” Other studies indicate that a majority of Americans believe that the nation ’ s political life should be based on “ Judeo-Christian principles , ” if the nation ’ s founding principles are not already .
Assertions of the nation ’ s religious origins and of divine providence behind the crafting of the governing instruments are especially popular among politicians . In fact , religious declarations by elected officials are so common today that they have become routine , if not banal . Frequently , allusions of God ’ s providence are ambiguous and are used simply as a ceremonial flourish , obviating the need for further elaboration . President Ronald Reagan , who was not a devout churchgoer despite his support from the evangelical Religious Right , regularly alluded to the nation ’ s providential past , remarking in one speech , “ Can we doubt that only a Divine Providence placed this land , this island of freedom , here as a refuge for all those people in the world who yearn to breathe free ? ” One could argue that Reagan ’ s embrace of a providential past was uncritical , if not undisciplined : in his acceptance speech at the 1980 Republican National Convention , Reagan displayed his legendary disregard for consistency by declaring America to be “ our portion of His creation ” while praising the contributions of the deist Tom Paine ! One particularly delicious statement is Dwight Eisenhower ’ s iconic remark that “ our form of Government has no sense unless it is founded in a deeply felt religious faith , and I don ’ t care what it is ! ” Usually , such rhetoric does little more than affirm a national “ civil religion , ” where the nation ’ s institutions and its destiny take on an indeterminate , quasi-sacred quality . Such utterances largely fulfill a unifying , ceremonial purpose .
Many politicians , however , have gone farther by advancing specific claims about America ’ s religious past and its significance for the present . At times , Reagan embraced a fuller notion of the myth . In a 1984 prayer breakfast , he declared that “ faith and religion play a critical role in the political life of our nation , ” asserting that the Founders had affirmed this relationship . “ Those who created our country , ” Reagan remarked , “ understood that there is a divine order which transcends the human order. ” The Founders viewed the government as “ a form of moral order , ” which found its basis in religion . Reagan was not alone among politicians on the conservative spectrum . In May 2010 , former Republican vice presidential candidate and Alaska governor Sarah Palin declared on Fox News that people should “ [ g ] o back to what our founders and our founding documents meant . They ’ re quite clear that we would create law based on the God of the Bible and the Ten Commandments . It ’ s pretty simple. ” And no modern politician drew more allusions to the nation ’ s religious heritage than did George W. Bush . A conservative evangelical , Bush frequently revealed his belief in America ’ s Christian origins , once affirming that “ [ o ] ur country was founded by men and women who realized their dependence on God and were humbled by His providence and grace. ” The Founders did more than simply acknowledge their obligation toward God , however ; for Bush , America was specially chosen , “ not because we consider ourselves a chosen nation ” but because “ God moves and chooses [ us ] as He wills. ” For Bush , this history had practical applications for present policies , legitimizing his enlistment of religious organizations to operate government-funded social service programs from a “ faith perspective ” ( i.e. , the “ Faith-Based Initiative ” ) . It also supported an active religious ( i.e. , Christian ) voice in the public realm : “ The faith of our Founding Fathers established the precedent that prayers and national days of prayer are an honored part of our American way of life , ” Bush insisted . As historian Richard T. Hughes has written about Bush , in his embrace of the myth , Bush “ thoroughly confused the Christian view of reality with the purposes of the United States . ”
Such rhetoric usually receives a pass from the mainstream press , perhaps because of its ubiquity . On occasion , the press criticizes a politician for too closely associating the nation ’ s history and goals with God ’ s purpose , but reporters usually consider such statements as being off-limits for critique . Possibly , this is because there is a long history of public officials from both political parties aligning the national will with God ’ s plan . Democrat Woodrow Wilson , our most evangelical president between Rutherford B. Hayes and Jimmy Carter , once said , “ America was born a Christian nation . America was born to exemplify that devotion to the elements of righteousness which are derived from the revelations of Holy Scripture. ” And the nation ’ s most beloved president , Abraham Lincoln , regularly averred that the nation was subject to God ’ s will , and to his judgment . Still , not all religious allusions have been the same . Lincoln ’ s religious rhetoric was often in the form of a jeremiad , calling the nation to a moral accountability . Lincoln was careful not to align God with the Union side during the Civil War , noting in his Second Inaugural Address that both sides “ read the same Bible and pray [ ed ] to the same God [ while ] invok [ ing ] His aid against the other. ” And Jimmy Carter , a devout Southern Baptist , also drew a line between supplicating God ’ s blessings and sanctifying the nation . Despite the nuanced rhetoric of some of our political leaders , religious declarations by politicians perpetuate the impression that America was specially ordained by God and that the nation ’ s governing documents and institutions reflect Christian values .
The resiliency of a belief in America ’ s religious origins , particularly of its “ chosen ” status , is , in part , perplexing . American religious exceptionalism has not been taught in the nation ’ s public schools since the mid-1900s , though the theme was common in school curricula , either explicitly or implicitly , for the first 150 years of public schooling . Yet the narrative persists , much of it from a religious or patriotic perspective , fueled by popular literature and the media and promoted by evangelical pastors and conservative politicians and commentators .
One explanation for the popularity of this account is that the idea of America ’ s religious founding has a protean , chameleon-like quality . For many people , the concept may mean little more than that America was settled in part by religious dissenters who helped establish a regime of religious liberty unmatched in the world at that time . For a related group , it is the belief that religious perspectives and values pervaded the colonial and revolutionary periods , and that the Founders—however they are defined—relied on those values , among others , in constructing the ideological basis for republican government . Closely associated with this last understanding is the sense that people of the founding generation were at ease with public acknowledgments of and support for religion , and that the Founders believed that moral virtue was indispensable for the nation ’ s well-being . A majority of Americans likely hold the above views to one degree or another . And all of these perspectives find degrees of support in the historical record . The above views , however , do not necessarily involve claims that America was specially chosen by God in the model of Old Testament Israel or that promote a form of religious exceptionalism , that is , a belief in the unique status and mission of the United States in the world . The embrace of religious exceptionalism represents the chief ideological break between the above perspectives and the remainder .
The next view , in level of intensity , shares much in common with the last perspective but elevates the role of religion from being one of many ideologies informing the founding era to a status of prominence . It argues that religion—frequently defined as Calvinism—was the chief energizing propulsion of the founding ideology and that the American democratic system can not be understood without appreciating its Christian roots . This perspective often emphasizes the religious piety of the Founders and their generation , disputing claims that a majority of the early leaders were religious rationalists or that the populace was generally non-churchgoing . The final perspective that can be distinguished under this broad taxonomy includes an additional claim of a divine intervention in the nation ’ s creation—that America was an especially chosen nation and that the Founders acted as they did due to God ’ s providential guiding hand . Under this last perspective , the nation ’ s past and founding documents assume an almost sacred quality . As can be appreciated , due to the variety of potential understandings and fluidity between perspectives , it can be difficult to decipher what one means when speaking of America ’ s Christian heritage or of it being a “ Christian nation. ” A vague assertion is likely to resonate with a large number of people .
Still , a distinctive argument about America ’ s religious foundings , one that encompasses the last two perspectives , has emerged in recent years , finding an audience among religious and political conservatives . Ever since the nation ’ s bicentennial , conservatives have raised claims about America ’ s Christian heritage in their efforts to gain the moral ( and political ) high ground in the ongoing culture wars . These arguments take on several forms , from asserting that the Founders relied on a pervasive Calvinist ideology when crafting notions of republicanism to claiming that the Founders were devout Christians and were guided in their actions by divine providence . As evidence , proponents point to public statements and official actions during the founding period—for example , thanksgiving day proclamations—that purportedly demonstrate a reliance on religious principles in the ordering of the nation ’ s political and legal institutions . A plethora of books have been published that attest to the Founders ’ religious piety and to their belief about the role of religion in civil government . Although these books are usually weak on historical scholarship , they project a degree of authority by frequently “ disclosing ” previously “ unknown ” historical data , purposely ignored ( allegedly ) by professional historians . The common theme , as expressed by popular evangelical author Tim LaHaye ( of the Left Behind series ) , is that an orthodox “ Christian consensus ” existed at the time of the founding and that the Founders intended to incorporate Judeo-Christian principles into the founding documents . As another writer summarizes the claim :
The history of America ’ s laws , its constitutional system , the reason for the American Revolution , or the basis of its guiding political philosophy can not accurately be discussed without reference to its biblical roots .
Connected to this central theme is a second common claim : that scholars , judges , and the liberal elite have censored America ’ s Christian past in a conspiracy to install a regime of secularism . Public school textbooks and college history courses generally avoid references to America ’ s religious heritage , creating the impression in the minds of students that that past did not exist . LaHaye calls this omission a “ deliberate rape of history , ” asserting that “ [ t ] he removal of religion as history from our schoolbooks betrays the intellectual dishonesty of secular humanist educators and reveals their blind hostility to Christianity. ” This account is promoted in textbooks published for private evangelical schools and Christian homeschoolers , with the popular God and Government asserting that there is “ a staggering amount of religious source material that shows the United States of America was founded as a Christian nation. ” But tragically , “ [ f ] or generations the true story of America ’ s faith has been obscured by those who deny the providential work of God in history . ”
Likely no person has written more about America ’ s Christian past , or has done more to promote ideas of a distinct Christian nationhood , than David Barton , a self-taught “ historian ” who is the darling of conservative politicians such as Newt Gingrich , Mike Huckabee , and Glenn Beck . Barton asserts that “ virtually every one of the fifty-five Founding Fathers who framed the Constitution were members of orthodox Christian churches and that many were outspoken evangelicals. ” According to Barton , these men believed that God intervened directly in the founding process and intended for Christian principles to be integrated into the operations of government . Even though scholars overwhelmingly criticize his writings , particularly his methodology of cherry-picking quotations of leading figures , Barton ’ s interpretation commands a large following . Religious and political conservatives , predisposed to distrust the liberal academy , remain impressed by Barton ’ s massive collection of historical documents demonstrating a “ Christian consensus ” at the founding .
The number of contemporary authors on the quest for a Christian America is legion . The Christian America concept moves beyond a simple and fundamental acknowledgement of Christianity ’ s significance in American history to a belief that the United States was established as a decidedly Christian nation . Driven by the belief that separation of church and state is a myth foisted upon the American people by secular courts and scholars , defenders of Christian America historiography claim they are merely recovering accurate American history from revisionist historians conspiring to expunge any remnant of Christianity from America ’ s past .
In characterizing the issue in such dire terms for people of faith , it is little wonder that the claim of America ’ s special religious past continues to resonate .
To a degree , these proponents—I will term them “ religionists ” —are not tilting at imaginary windmills . For more than sixty years the dominant legal interpretation of the nation ’ s constitutional founding was that the Founders intended to establish a “ high wall of separation between church and state , ” as Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black declared in 1947 . The model was Thomas Jefferson ’ s metaphorical Wall , and its scripture was James Madison ’ s Memorial and Remonstrance , not those annoyingly contrary actions like the First Congress ’ s appointment of a chaplain in 1789 . The high point—or low point , depending on one ’ s perspective—came in 1962 and 1963 , when the Supreme Court struck down nonsectarian prayer and Bible reading in the nation ’ s schools , practices that had extended back to the beginnings of American public education and that were viewed by many as affirming the nation ’ s gratitude to a beneficent God . Even though the high court never held that public schools could not teach about the nation ’ s religious heritage if done from an academic perspective , rather than from a devotional one—with the Court going out of its way to reaffirm that a “ [ child ’ s ] education is not complete without a study of comparative religion or the history of religion and its relationship to the advancement of civilization ” —most curriculum planners avoided addressing this contentious subject . For many religious conservatives , the Supreme Court ’ s embrace of a secular-oriented jurisprudence of church-state separation was unsettling and went against their understandings about the nation ’ s religious heritage .
Religionists have also rightly perceived hostility to Christian nation claims from the secular academy . For years , the scholarly historical canon maintained that the Founders relied chiefly on rational Enlightenment norms , not religious ones , when fashioning the nation ’ s governing principles . Lawyer and historian Leo Pfeffer led the way for the “ secularist ” interpretation in the 1950 and 1960s , to be followed by scholars such as Leonard Levy , Gordon Wood , Jon Butler , Frank Lambert , Geoffrey Stone , and Isaac Kramnick and R. Lawrence Moore in their popular book , The Godless Constitution . While these scholars acknowledge the importance of religious thought and movements during the revolutionary period , they see a variety of ideological impulses that influenced the founding generation . Still , most scholars vigorously dispute religionist claims about the “ centrality of religious ideas ” behind the Revolution , of the “ fact of a substantial spiritual dimension to our founding , ” or that “ Revolutionary-era political thought was , above all , Protestant inspired . ”
A third position has emerged recently in this debate , one that could be termed an “ accommodationist ” approach . This movement has been led chiefly—though not entirely—by scholars with conservative religious or political leanings . Their scholarship has sought to document the diversity in religious sentiment , particularly forms of Protestant orthodoxy , among members of the founding generation , including those within the political leadership . In addition , accommodationists have worked to expand the pool of influential Founders , arguing that the church-state views of icons Thomas Jefferson and James Madison “ are among the least representative of the founders. ” They criticize the accepted canon as a “ selective approach to history ” that “ distort [ s ] . . . the founders ’ collective views on religion , religious liberty , and church state relations. ” The book titles promoting this interpretation are revealing : The Forgotten Founders on Religion and Public Life ; and Forgotten Features of the Founding . Like religionist writers , this perspective frequently emphasizes the Founders ’ personal religious piety and their commitment to a public virtue . It asserts that the Founders could be both professing Christians and political rationalists and committed to a moderate scheme of church-state separation . These scholars frequently side with the religionists regarding the Founders ’ belief in divine providence and their reliance on “ higher ” norms when conceptualizing legal rights and liberties . In contrast , accommodationists generally agree with secularist scholars about the variety of ideological impulses that informed the founding period , although they usually place more weight on religious statements and actions by the Founders . This latter emphasis means that accommodationist scholars are closer to religionists in asserting the primacy of religious thought during the founding period . While this effort to expand on the diversity of thought during the founding period is commendable , it often becomes blurred by corresponding efforts to marginalize the impact of leading Founders who held heterodox religious views ( e.g. , Thomas Jefferson , Benjamin Franklin ) .
While most , though not all , accommodationist scholars are not agenda driven , their conclusions often confirm the claims of Christian nationalists like LaHaye and Barton . In particular , the religionist position has drawn support from conservative legal scholars who have criticized the Supreme Court ’ s “ separationist ” interpretation of church-state relations , particularly the Stone-Warren-Burger Courts ’ reliance on the writings of Jefferson and Madison . As one leading scholar , Harold Berman , writing in the mid-1980s , maintained :
[ Prior to the 1940s ] America professed itself to be a Christian country . Even two generations ago , if one asked Americans where our Constitution—or , indeed , our whole concept of law—came from , on what it was ultimately based , the overwhelming majority would have said , “ the Ten Commandments , ” or “ the Bible , ” or perhaps “ the law of God . ”
Berman bemoaned that since that time , America ’ s public philosophy had “ shifted radically from a religious to a secular theory of law , from a moral to a political or instrumental theory , and from a communitarian to an individualistic theory. ” A decade later , Yale law professor Stephen Carter charged in his missive , The Culture of Disbelief , that there was a pervasive disregard of faith in the popular culture , one that was perpetuated by a secular-leaning elite . Other scholars with evangelical leanings have more willingly embraced parts of the religionist argument—chiefly that religion was a leading factor inspiring and motivating the Founders—thus validating major claims of the popular religionist writers .
This renewed attention to the nation ’ s Christian foundings has not gone unnoticed by sympathetic politicians and officials , such as the members of the Texas State Board of Education , and conservative judges such as William Rehnquist , Antonin Scalia , and Clarence Thomas . This narrative has impacted the content of social science curriculum in Texas schools and the judicial interpretation of First Amendment jurisprudence . Justices have cited the nation ’ s religious heritage in upholding legislative prayers and displays of Christian crosses and the Ten Commandments on government property . During the Cold War , the justices once declared that “ [ w ] e are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being. ” Conservative justices have dusted off that statement , while adding “ that the Founding Fathers believed devoutly that there was a God and that the unalienable rights of man were rooted in Him is clearly evidenced in their writings , from the Mayflower Compact to the Constitution itself. ” Religion , Chief Justice Rehnquist concluded , “ has been closely identified with our history and government. ” Armed with this historical ammunition , religious and legal conservatives give notice that the accepted interpretation of the nation ’ s non-religious founding is contestable territory .
Excerpted from `` Inventing a Christian America : The Myth of the Religious Founding '' by Steven K. Green . Published by Oxford University Press . Copyright 2015 by Steven K. Green . Reprinted with permission of the publisher . All rights reserved .","One of the more popular and enduring accounts of America’s past is that of its religious founding. Belief that the British-American colonies were settled largely by religiously devout people in search of spiritual freedom, that the United States government was founded in part on religious principles, that the Founders intended to create a “Christian nation,” and that America is a specially chosen nation whose success has been directed by divine providence has resonated in the national psyche for generations. Versions of this account have existed since the founding era and have persisted through times of national distress, trial, and triumph. They represent a leading theme in our nation’s historical narrative, frequently intertwined with expressions of patriotism and American exceptionalism.

Opinion polls indicate that many Americans hold vague, if not explicit, ideas about the nation’s religious foundings. According to a 2008 study by the First Amendment Center, over 50 percent of Americans believe that the U.S Constitution created a Christian nation, notwithstanding its express prohibitions on religious establishments and religious tests for public office holding. A similar study conducted by the Pew Forum on Religion in Public Life revealed even higher numbers, noting that “Americans overwhelmingly consider the U.S. a Christian nation: Two-in-three (67%) characterize the nation this way.” Other studies indicate that a majority of Americans believe that the nation’s political life should be based on “Judeo-Christian principles,” if the nation’s founding principles are not already.

Assertions of the nation’s religious origins and of divine providence behind the crafting of the governing instruments are especially popular among politicians. In fact, religious declarations by elected officials are so common today that they have become routine, if not banal. Frequently, allusions of God’s providence are ambiguous and are used simply as a ceremonial flourish, obviating the need for further elaboration. President Ronald Reagan, who was not a devout churchgoer despite his support from the evangelical Religious Right, regularly alluded to the nation’s providential past, remarking in one speech, “Can we doubt that only a Divine Providence placed this land, this island of freedom, here as a refuge for all those people in the world who yearn to breathe free?” One could argue that Reagan’s embrace of a providential past was uncritical, if not undisciplined: in his acceptance speech at the 1980 Republican National Convention, Reagan displayed his legendary disregard for consistency by declaring America to be “our portion of His creation” while praising the contributions of the deist Tom Paine! One particularly delicious statement is Dwight Eisenhower’s iconic remark that “our form of Government has no sense unless it is founded in a deeply felt religious faith, and I don’t care what it is!” Usually, such rhetoric does little more than affirm a national “civil religion,” where the nation’s institutions and its destiny take on an indeterminate, quasi-sacred quality. Such utterances largely fulfill a unifying, ceremonial purpose.

Many politicians, however, have gone farther by advancing specific claims about America’s religious past and its significance for the present. At times, Reagan embraced a fuller notion of the myth. In a 1984 prayer breakfast, he declared that “faith and religion play a critical role in the political life of our nation,” asserting that the Founders had affirmed this relationship. “Those who created our country,” Reagan remarked, “understood that there is a divine order which transcends the human order.” The Founders viewed the government as “a form of moral order,” which found its basis in religion. Reagan was not alone among politicians on the conservative spectrum. In May 2010, former Republican vice presidential candidate and Alaska governor Sarah Palin declared on Fox News that people should “[g]o back to what our founders and our founding documents meant. They’re quite clear that we would create law based on the God of the Bible and the Ten Commandments. It’s pretty simple.” And no modern politician drew more allusions to the nation’s religious heritage than did George W. Bush. A conservative evangelical, Bush frequently revealed his belief in America’s Christian origins, once affirming that “[o]ur country was founded by men and women who realized their dependence on God and were humbled by His providence and grace.” The Founders did more than simply acknowledge their obligation toward God, however; for Bush, America was specially chosen, “not because we consider ourselves a chosen nation” but because “God moves and chooses [us] as He wills.” For Bush, this history had practical applications for present policies, legitimizing his enlistment of religious organizations to operate government-funded social service programs from a “faith perspective” (i.e., the “Faith-Based Initiative”). It also supported an active religious (i.e., Christian) voice in the public realm: “The faith of our Founding Fathers established the precedent that prayers and national days of prayer are an honored part of our American way of life,” Bush insisted. As historian Richard T. Hughes has written about Bush, in his embrace of the myth, Bush “thoroughly confused the Christian view of reality with the purposes of the United States.”

Such rhetoric usually receives a pass from the mainstream press, perhaps because of its ubiquity. On occasion, the press criticizes a politician for too closely associating the nation’s history and goals with God’s purpose, but reporters usually consider such statements as being off-limits for critique. Possibly, this is because there is a long history of public officials from both political parties aligning the national will with God’s plan. Democrat Woodrow Wilson, our most evangelical president between Rutherford B. Hayes and Jimmy Carter, once said, “America was born a Christian nation. America was born to exemplify that devotion to the elements of righteousness which are derived from the revelations of Holy Scripture.” And the nation’s most beloved president, Abraham Lincoln, regularly averred that the nation was subject to God’s will, and to his judgment. Still, not all religious allusions have been the same. Lincoln’s religious rhetoric was often in the form of a jeremiad, calling the nation to a moral accountability. Lincoln was careful not to align God with the Union side during the Civil War, noting in his Second Inaugural Address that both sides “read the same Bible and pray[ed] to the same God [while] invok[ing] His aid against the other.” And Jimmy Carter, a devout Southern Baptist, also drew a line between supplicating God’s blessings and sanctifying the nation. Despite the nuanced rhetoric of some of our political leaders, religious declarations by politicians perpetuate the impression that America was specially ordained by God and that the nation’s governing documents and institutions reflect Christian values.

Pope Francis has changed the teachings of the Catholic faith to officially oppose the death penalty in all circumstances, the Vatican has said.

The Catechism of the Church, a codified doctrine which sums up teachings, had previously stated that the death penalty could be used in some cases.

It now says it is ""inadmissible because it is an attack on the inviolability and dignity of the person"".

A collision course with conservatives in the US?

By James Reynolds, BBC News, Rome

The Catholic Church may base its faith on an unchanging Bible, but that does not stop the institution from updating some of its most important teachings.

Centuries ago, popes called Christians to Holy War, commanded their own armies, and showed little anxiety about the killing of their enemies. In modern times, popes have re-invented themselves as symbols of global peace. But until now the Church had taught that the death penalty was ""an acceptable, albeit extreme means of safeguarding the common good"".

Pope Francis - who has made mercy a theme of his papacy - has now decided that this has to change by ruling the death penalty ""inadmissible"". This may put the Church in direct conflict with conservative Catholics in the US who insist that capital punishment is justified.

Historically, the Church has mostly been unopposed to the death penalty, including into the 20th Century. In 1952, Pope Pius XII said it was not a violation of the universal right to life.

Pope John Paul II argued for imprisonment over execution wherever possible, although Joseph Ratzinger, who later became Pope Benedict XVI, wrote that the death penalty could be permissible.

Where is the death penalty still legal?

The death penalty is still legal in 53 countries around the world.

In the United States, where 22% of the population are Catholic, execution is still legal in 31 states.

It is still also legal in Cuba, Dominica and Uganda - where about half of their populations are Catholic.

The only place in Europe where it is still legal is Belarus, which has a sizeable Catholic minority of about 7% of the population.

""Rise of LGBT rights in general, and especially the court's same-sex marriage decision, are the only explanation for their resurgence in political salience,"" he said, referring to religious freedom laws.

Religious institutions encounter real difficulties

Religious freedom bills have actually been growing since the U.S. Religious Freedom Restoration Act became law in 1993, which was designed to prohibit the federal government from ""substantially burdening"" a person's exercise of religion.

The law passed with the backing of a broad-based coalition, but it wasn't set against the more recent backdrop of gay rights or the wave of marriage equality laws and court rulings that culminated in the Obergefell decision.

Tim Holbrook, a professor of law at Emory University School of Law, wrote a CNN opinion piece last year following the landmark decision, saying same-sex marriages have created difficulties for religious institutions.

""As Chief Justice John Roberts asked: Will religious institutions that provide married student housing be forced to allow same-sex married couples into such housing, even if their faith finds same-sex relationships to conflict with their beliefs?"" wrote Holbrook, an LGBT commentator.

""Can a religious employer refuse to hire, or even fire, someone who is in a same-sex marriage? These interstitial areas will have to be addressed,"" Holbrook wrote.

Douglas Laycock, a constitutional scholar at the University of Virginia Law School who helped win passage of Religious Freedom Restoration Act, said state RFRAs have been underenforced.

""But they have done some good in cases that do not involve culture war issues and that the press has mostly not covered,"" he said.

Some examples: cases involving Orthodox Jewish prisoners wanting kosher meals and churches barred from feeding the homeless.

Laycock added, ""We tell our children we provide liberty and justice 'for all.' What we need to implement that promise are strong gay-rights laws, with strong religious exemptions for religious organizations and for individuals and very small businesses in religious contexts.""

Clash manifests in real life

Real-world examples added fuel to the debate.

In September, a county clerk in Kentucky spent six days in jail for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.

Rowan County clerk Kim Davis refused to give licenses to same-sex couples despite the Supreme Court's decision in June that legalized same-sex marriage across the country. She claimed that doing so would violate her Christian convictions against same-sex marriage.

""There is no political support for respecting the liberty of both sides,"" Laycock said.

""The Republicans don't want gay-rights laws. ... And the Democrats don't want religious exemptions. The earlier generation of gay-rights laws all have exemptions for churches and religious nonprofits, but it appears that gay-rights groups are no longer willing to agree to such exemptions.""

States respond to local LGBT protections

In November, Houston voters rejected the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, a 2014 measure intended for protecting LGBT rights.

The ballot issue drew national attention, with conservative opponents claiming the law would allow troubled men to go into women's restrooms and locker rooms.

The campaign to undo HERO became a focal point for the right, which spent millions and recruited an assortment of local celebrities to their cause, including former Houston Astros star outfielder Lance Berkman.

Critics say the Houston referendum and an accompanying wave of so-called bathroom bills discriminate against transgender people. Corporations voiced their opposition and even threatened to use their economic muscle to block them.

Last month, North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory signed into law a measure that blocked cities from allowing transgender people to use public bathrooms designated for the sex as which they identify. House Bill 2 (the Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act) was passed on the heels of a Charlotte city ordinance allowing transgender people to use the bathrooms of their choice.

The law reserves to the state the right to pass nondiscrimination legislation, saying state laws supersede local ordinances.

In response, PayPal announced that it had canceled plans to open a new global operations center in Charlotte, costing the state's largest city 400 jobs.

States proceed despite backlash

The cycle of action and reaction has become familiar, if not entirely predictable: Social conservatives lament instances where business owners find themselves in hot water for controversial statements or actions; targeted measures are enacted; social liberals denounce the measures; business interests become involved.

A year ago, Indiana's legislature passed a law intended to protect Christian businesses that did not want to provide services to gays and lesbians -- particularly for same-sex weddings. But a week later -- driven by businesses' concerns over discrimination -- the law was amended so that it could not be used to override current and future civil rights protections, including local anti-discrimination ordinances.

Since 1993, 21 states have enacted religious freedom laws and amendments modeled after the RFRA, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Ten other states are considering similar legislation, according to the conference.

Laycock said 11 states have interpreted their constitutions to include RFRA-like protection.

""I suspect the legislators who support these laws are just currying favor with the religious right wing,"" said Lupu, the GWU constitutional law expert. ""They'll get political credit for the support, and any governor who vetoes will get the blame from the religious right.""

Laycock called the threat of boycotts ""ill-informed and deeply intolerant of religious minorities.""

""But they are real, and they have intimidated some governors and some legislatures,"" he said.

""In places where these bills have passed ... I think we have to assume [there are] deep-red Republicans who don't care what anyone else thinks, or who even delight in flouting elite opinion.""

Francis commended four Americans in particular , whom he held up as examples of pursuing the common good : Abraham Lincoln , for his pursuit of liberty ; Martin Luther King Jr. , for his commitment to nonviolence and pluralism ; Trappist monk Thomas Merton , for his commitment to dialogue and peace ; and Dorothy Day , for her “ social activism , her passion for justice and for the cause of the oppressed . ”
None of them are exactly conservative , but Day in particular is noted as a radical social activist . She founded the Catholic Worker Movement , which took root during the Great Depression , and urged Catholics to form small , autonomous communities to lead simple lives devoted to the gospel and serving the poor . In addition to being a socialist , Day was outspoken in her support of pacifism and labor rights . “ I think it was extraordinary that he cited her as one of the most important people in recent American history . This would be one of the very , very few times that somebody as radical as Dorothy Day was mentioned , '' Sen. Bernie Sander told the Washington Post .
The abortion switcheroo . In defiance of the specific guidance not to try to score political points by clapping at partisan applause lines in Francis ’ speech , congressional conservatives leapt to their feet the moment Francis delivered the Vatican ’ s standard coded language about abortion , mentioning “ our responsibility to protect and defend human life at every stage of its development. ” Imagine their shock when he immediately followed that with , “ This conviction had led me , from the beginning of my ministry , to advocate at different levels for the global abolition of the death penalty. ” Psych .
Catholic social teaching has long put opposition to the death penalty on the same plane as opposition to abortion , most famously with Chicago Archbishop Joseph Bernardin ’ s “ seamless garment ” doctrine , which held sway in the mid-1980s as progressive bishops reminded Catholics that opposition to the death penalty and nuclear war was just as important as abortion
Calling arms deals “ money drenched in blood. ” Speaking of death , what about all those arms deals the Republicans are so fond of ? Francis wanted to know who is selling the bad guys all these weapons and why : “ Why are deadly weapons being sold to those who plan to inflict untold suffering on individuals and society ? ” The answer , according to the pontiff , is “ money : money that is drenched in blood , often innocent blood . In the face of this shameful and culpable silence , it is our duty to confront the problem and to stop the arms trade. ” I ’ m sure the GOP and all the defense contractors who give them money will get right on that .
Reminding the GOP we ’ re all foreigners . As in his speech at the White House on Tuesday , Francis felt the need to once again remind those who are making intolerance toward immigrants their political stock-in-trade that they , like him , are likely the descendants of immigrant families . “ [ M ] illions of people came to this land to pursue their dream of building a future in freedom , ” he said , adding , “ We , the people of this continent , are not fearful of foreigners , because most of us were once foreigners . I say this to you as the son of immigrants , knowing that so many of you are also descended from immigrants . ”
Catholic social teaching reminds Catholics of their duty to “ welcome the stranger . ”
In one of the most moving passages of his speech , Francis said , “ Let us seek for others the same possibilities which we seek for ourselves . Let us help others to grow , as we would like to be helped ourselves . In a word , if we want security , let us give security ; if we want life , let us give life ; if we want opportunities , let us provide opportunities . ”
Confronting the climate naysayers . Francis made it clear that combating climate change , development and technology can coexist . He explicitly rebuked many conservative critics of his climate change encyclical `` Laudato si , '' who claim that he is anti-commerce and wants to stifle development or reduce the world to subsistence-level farming to stop climate change . “ The right use of natural resources , the proper application of technology and the harnessing of the spirit of enterprise are essential elements of an economy which seeks to be modern , inclusive and sustainable , ” he said , adding , “ In this regard , I am confident that America ’ s outstanding academic and research institutions can make a vital contribution in the years ahead . ”
On the plus for conservatives side , Francis did talk about the need for “ the voice of faith to continue to be heard , ” but in the case of this particular voice , conservatives probably wish he would just be quiet .
Patricia Miller is the author of “ Good Catholics : The Battle Over Abortion in the Catholic Church. ” Her work on politics , sex and religion has appeared in the Atlantic , the Nation , Huffington Post , and Ms. Magazine .","Despite all the talk that Pope Francis’ address to Congress wouldn’t be political or partisan, it turns out it was both. And, as I predicted here in Salon, it definitely leaned to one side of the aisle. In fact, if you were a conservative Republican, Thursday morning in the Congress was not your finest moment, as Pope Francis laid bare all the ways that the Republican agenda counters Catholic social teaching, from its harsh treatment of immigrants to its fossil fuel-burning disdain for the natural world.

And Francis’ call for politicians to work for the common good was an implicit rebuke to the do-nothing, obstructionist GOP agenda that’s in service to their corporatist, Chamber of Commerce overlords. “Your own responsibility as members of Congress is to enable this country, by your legislative activity, to grow as a nation. …You are called to defend and preserve the dignity of your fellow citizens in the tireless and demanding pursuit of the common good, for this is the chief aim of all politics,” he said.

PHILADELPHIA — Pope Francis celebrated Mass with hundreds of thousands in the streets of the City of Brotherly Love on Sunday, closing his historic six-day visit to the U.S. where he drew big and enthusiastic crowds wherever he went.

His visit to Philadelphia, the third leg of his U.S. trip that also took him to New York and Washington, coincided with the World Meeting of Families, and Francis used his final scheduled public appearance of the trip to connect faith with family.

In his homily, Francis told the faithful that much like happiness, ""holiness is always tied to little gestures.""

""These little gestures are those we learn at home, in the family; they get lost amid all the other things we do, yet they do make each day different,"" Francis said. ""They are the quiet things done by mothers and grandmothers, by fathers and grandfathers, by children. They are little signs of tenderness, affection and compassion.""

At the conclusion of his Mass, Francis made one small personal request. “I ask you to pray for me,"" Francis said. ""Don’t forget!”

Later on Sunday, in a farewell speech attended by Vice President Biden and his family, Francis recalled details of the USA trip, including his visit to New York's Ground Zero, ""the place that speaks so powerfully of the mystery of evil.""

""Yet we know with certainty that evil never has the last word,"" he said, to applause from the crowd. ""In God’s merciful plan, love and peace triumph over all.”

Francis' last officials words: “May God bless you all — God bless America.”

His flight, a private American Airlines jet, departed for Rome around 7:45 p.m. ET. He was scheduled to speak to reporters once in the air.

Pope Francis trip highlighted by unscripted moments

Organizers earlier on Sunday said the Mass, which Francis celebrated a stone's throw away from the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art made famous in the movie Rocky, was expected to draw as many as 1 million participants. It capped a busy day for the pontiff, who spoke to victims of clergy sex abuse and vowed to provide ""careful oversight"" to protect young believers in the future.

He also visited a correctional facility where he blessed inmates and made an unscheduled stop at a local Jesuit university.

Catholics, as well as non-Catholics who are simply fans of ""the people's pope,"" began flooding the Benjamin Franklin Parkway early on an overcast Sunday in hopes of landing a prime spot to bid Francis farewell. The parkway, an iconic thoroughfare, was dotted with big screens to watch the 78-year-old pontiff deliver his final message to the American people before his return trip to Rome.

Boisterous church groups banging drums and singing songs went suddenly silent as the first strains of the musical preludes of the service wafted over the city streets. Crowds blocks away joined in the chanting and prayers as Mass began.

As I discussed in the following article from 2014 , this has been a long time coming .
One of the things that made Archbishop Oscar Romero so extraordinary , I realized long after I met him and long after he was murdered , was that at first he seemed to be so ordinary . When I went to interview him in early 1980 , I was led to believe I ’ d be meeting a man who would change the world , or , at least , the little world of El Salvador . But he seemed on first encounter to be very gray , more a forgettable clerk than a firebrand cleric . Not a revolutionary , certainly . Not a martyr . Not a saint .
In his quiet , affable , good-humored way , he never seemed to want to be any of those things , in any case , and yet in the minds of millions of people , especially in Latin America , he became all of them .
Only the popes held out against him . For three decades the theological machinery of John Paul II and Benedict XVI prevented the martyred Romero from advancing toward the formal title of saint , a long process that was fast-tracked for John Paul II himself , and also for much less sympathetic figures like the founder of the wealthy and secretive order Opus Dei .
Yes , symbolic gestures were made . John Paul II twice visited Romero ’ s tomb in the cathedral in San Salvador . But the conservative popes from Poland and Germany did n't like the way people fighting for the rights of the poor — some of whom were communists , many of whom were leftists wrapped up in what was called “ the theology of liberation ” — adopted Romero as a symbol . John Paul and Benedict both detested that current in the church , seeing it as a front for politics , not faith . As Benedict told reporters in 2007 , “ the problem was that a political party wanted to take [ Romero ] for itself as a flag , as an emblematic figure. ” Benedict conceded this was “ unjust , ” but “ for reasons of prudence , ” it was said , Romero ’ s beatification was put on hold .
Last week , finally , Pope Francis , from Argentina , told reporters bluntly that the Salvadoran ’ s path toward official sainthood had been blocked by his predecessors and “ now it is unblocked . ”
Perhaps even more importantly , Francis suggested that once Romero moves forward on the way to formal sainthood , others who were even more closely identified with liberation theology than he was — and who paid with their lives — could follow on the same path .
One of those was a Jesuit , like the pope , named Rutilio Grande . In 1977 Grande gave a famous homily in Apopa , El Salvador , warning that “ very soon the Bible and the Gospel will not be able to come across our borders . We will get the covers , nothing more , because all the pages are ‘ subversive. ’ ” And if Jesus of Nazareth were to come to El Salvador , Grande told his flock , Christ would be arrested and “ crucified all over again. ” Shortly afterward , Grande and two others with him were murdered .
The killing went on and on . In December 1980 , four American churchwomen were raped and murdered by members of the Salvadoran Guardia Nacional . In 1989 , the widely respected rector of San Salvador ’ s Universidad Centroamericana , along with five other Jesuits , a housekeeper and her daughter , were slaughtered by officers from the Salvadoran government that was , by then , getting heavy support from Washington .
These men and women who died for their faith must be at once inspiring and troubling for Francis , who identifies so closely with the poor himself that conservative Catholics have tied themselves in knots trying to portray him as a friend , or at least not the enemy , of capitalism . Certainly his personal warmth and humility is , in many respects , reminiscent of Romero ’ s .
Francis was himself a witness to the dirty wars in Latin America in the 1970s and ’ 80s that cost so many priests and nuns their lives . At the height of the violence he was the provincial superior of all the Jesuits in Argentina , which should have been an influential position . He has done penance since , feeling that he and his fellow churchmen did not speak out strongly enough against the atrocities taking place in the name of anti-communism .
So , Pope Francis makes a nod to the theological hurdles that martyrs must pass through to become saints on the roster of the Catholic Church : “ For me Romero is a man of God , but the process has to be followed , and the Lord too has to give his sign. ” But there is no question where this pope ’ s sympathies lie , and any believer who knows Romero ’ s story would have to think that the Lord has given many signs .
Still , the Vatican will call in its experts . We will hear , no doubt , that Romero ’ s blood , stored separately from his embalmed body , was still liquid years later . Indeed , a vial was given to John Paul . People will testify they were cured of dread diseases when they prayed to Romero . And there will be debates about whether or not Romero died in odium fidei , at the hands of those who hated his faith , which would make him a martyr more quickly eligible for sainthood . As Pope Francis said last week , “ this is a task for the theologians. ” But it ’ s likely the pontiff will give them guidance .
When I was covering the wars in Central America , all of us knew that the archbishop would be killed . After the murder of Rutilio Grande , who was his friend , Romero began to speak out ever more critically of the government and of the rich in a country where the gap between the wealthy and the poor — really , the oligarchs and the peasantry — was on a feudal scale . The gray cleric , who had been given the position of archbishop partly because he seemed so uncontroversial , began to articulate the hopes and dreams and finally the desperation of the dispossessed . Guerrillas with Cuban backing were making a bid for power . But Romero became the most visible and most important enemy of the oligarchs and of those in the military and on its margins who defended their interests .
One day a cameraman friend of mine went out to a rural community where Romero was performing a mass wedding ceremony for campesinos who had lived together for years as husband and wife , but had never had their marriage blessed by the church . On the way back , the cameraman ran into a group of men who looked like the thugs usually associated with the right-wing death squads . He struck up a conversation with them and realized that , indeed , they had been sent to kill the archbishop , but when his car approached and they saw him , and he stopped and talked to them , they could not do it .
Then on March 23 , Romero delivered a truly impassioned homily . “ I want to make a special appeal to soldiers , national guardsmen , and policemen : each of you is one of us , ” he said . “ The peasants you kill are your own brothers and sisters . When you hear a man telling you to kill , remember God ’ s words , ‘ thou shalt not kill. ’ No soldier is obliged to obey a law contrary to the law of God . In the name of God , in the name of our tormented people , I beseech you , I implore you ; in the name of God I command you to stop the repression . ”
The next evening , Romero was saying mass in the chapel at the hospice where he lived in a tiny room near the infirm and the dying . A gunman on the road outside shot him through the heart .
At Romero ’ s funeral a week later , tens of thousands of mourners turned out knowing there was a chance they might be killed , and at least 35 of them died when shooting erupted — whether by the military or the guerrillas or both remains disputed . Most of the dead were crushed in the panic . I was there , and I can tell you the miracle was that any of us survived .
Someday in the not too distant future , Romero will be beatified . And then , if Pope Francis is still with us , we may well see the leftist saints come marching in .","On Wednesday, the Vatican announced officially that Pope Francis has given final approval to several sainthood causes, including that of slain Salvadoran Archbishop Oscar Romero. As I discussed in the following article from 2014, this has been a long time coming.

—Christopher Dickey, March 7, 2018

One of the things that made Archbishop Oscar Romero so extraordinary, I realized long after I met him and long after he was murdered, was that at first he seemed to be so ordinary. When I went to interview him in early 1980, I was led to believe I’d be meeting a man who would change the world, or, at least, the little world of El Salvador. But he seemed on first encounter to be very gray, more a forgettable clerk than a firebrand cleric. Not a revolutionary, certainly. Not a martyr. Not a saint.

In his quiet, affable, good-humored way, he never seemed to want to be any of those things, in any case, and yet in the minds of millions of people, especially in Latin America, he became all of them.

Only the popes held out against him. For three decades the theological machinery of John Paul II and Benedict XVI prevented the martyred Romero from advancing toward the formal title of saint, a long process that was fast-tracked for John Paul II himself, and also for much less sympathetic figures like the founder of the wealthy and secretive order Opus Dei.

Yes, symbolic gestures were made. John Paul II twice visited Romero’s tomb in the cathedral in San Salvador. But the conservative popes from Poland and Germany didn't like the way people fighting for the rights of the poor — some of whom were communists, many of whom were leftists wrapped up in what was called “the theology of liberation” — adopted Romero as a symbol. John Paul and Benedict both detested that current in the church, seeing it as a front for politics, not faith. As Benedict told reporters in 2007, “the problem was that a political party wanted to take [Romero] for itself as a flag, as an emblematic figure.” Benedict conceded this was “unjust,” but “for reasons of prudence,” it was said, Romero’s beatification was put on hold.

Last week, finally, Pope Francis, from Argentina, told reporters bluntly that the Salvadoran’s path toward official sainthood had been blocked by his predecessors and “now it is unblocked.”

Perhaps even more importantly, Francis suggested that once Romero moves forward on the way to formal sainthood, others who were even more closely identified with liberation theology than he was — and who paid with their lives — could follow on the same path.

One of those was a Jesuit, like the pope, named Rutilio Grande. In 1977 Grande gave a famous homily in Apopa, El Salvador, warning that “very soon the Bible and the Gospel will not be able to come across our borders. We will get the covers, nothing more, because all the pages are ‘subversive.’” And if Jesus of Nazareth were to come to El Salvador, Grande told his flock, Christ would be arrested and “crucified all over again.” Shortly afterward, Grande and two others with him were murdered.

The killing went on and on. In December 1980, four American churchwomen were raped and murdered by members of the Salvadoran Guardia Nacional. In 1989, the widely respected rector of San Salvador’s Universidad Centroamericana, along with five other Jesuits, a housekeeper and her daughter, were slaughtered by officers from the Salvadoran government that was, by then, getting heavy support from Washington.

These men and women who died for their faith must be at once inspiring and troubling for Francis, who identifies so closely with the poor himself that conservative Catholics have tied themselves in knots trying to portray him as a friend, or at least not the enemy, of capitalism. Certainly his personal warmth and humility is, in many respects, reminiscent of Romero’s.

Francis was himself a witness to the dirty wars in Latin America in the 1970s and ’80s that cost so many priests and nuns their lives. At the height of the violence he was the provincial superior of all the Jesuits in Argentina, which should have been an influential position. He has done penance since, feeling that he and his fellow churchmen did not speak out strongly enough against the atrocities taking place in the name of anti-communism.

So, Pope Francis makes a nod to the theological hurdles that martyrs must pass through to become saints on the roster of the Catholic Church: “For me Romero is a man of God, but the process has to be followed, and the Lord too has to give his sign.” But there is no question where this pope’s sympathies lie, and any believer who knows Romero’s story would have to think that the Lord has given many signs.

Still, the Vatican will call in its experts. We will hear, no doubt, that Romero’s blood, stored separately from his embalmed body, was still liquid years later. Indeed, a vial was given to John Paul. People will testify they were cured of dread diseases when they prayed to Romero. And there will be debates about whether or not Romero died in odium fidei, at the hands of those who hated his faith, which would make him a martyr more quickly eligible for sainthood. As Pope Francis said last week, “this is a task for the theologians.” But it’s likely the pontiff will give them guidance.

When I was covering the wars in Central America, all of us knew that the archbishop would be killed. After the murder of Rutilio Grande, who was his friend, Romero began to speak out ever more critically of the government and of the rich in a country where the gap between the wealthy and the poor — really, the oligarchs and the peasantry — was on a feudal scale. The gray cleric, who had been given the position of archbishop partly because he seemed so uncontroversial, began to articulate the hopes and dreams and finally the desperation of the dispossessed. Guerrillas with Cuban backing were making a bid for power. But Romero became the most visible and most important enemy of the oligarchs and of those in the military and on its margins who defended their interests.

One day a cameraman friend of mine went out to a rural community where Romero was performing a mass wedding ceremony for campesinos who had lived together for years as husband and wife, but had never had their marriage blessed by the church. On the way back, the cameraman ran into a group of men who looked like the thugs usually associated with the right-wing death squads. He struck up a conversation with them and realized that, indeed, they had been sent to kill the archbishop, but when his car approached and they saw him, and he stopped and talked to them, they could not do it.

Then on March 23, Romero delivered a truly impassioned homily. “I want to make a special appeal to soldiers, national guardsmen, and policemen: each of you is one of us,” he said. “The peasants you kill are your own brothers and sisters. When you hear a man telling you to kill, remember God’s words, ‘thou shalt not kill.’ No soldier is obliged to obey a law contrary to the law of God. In the name of God, in the name of our tormented people, I beseech you, I implore you; in the name of God I command you to stop the repression.”

The next evening, Romero was saying mass in the chapel at the hospice where he lived in a tiny room near the infirm and the dying. A gunman on the road outside shot him through the heart.

At Romero’s funeral a week later, tens of thousands of mourners turned out knowing there was a chance they might be killed, and at least 35 of them died when shooting erupted — whether by the military or the guerrillas or both remains disputed. Most of the dead were crushed in the panic. I was there, and I can tell you the miracle was that any of us survived.

Someday in the not too distant future, Romero will be beatified. And then, if Pope Francis is still with us, we may well see the leftist saints come marching in.",www.thedailybeast.com,left,xwgvJelSStij89H7

“ God does not regard the fetus as a soul , no matter how far gestation has progressed , ” he wrote in a 1968 Christianity Today article . “ Clearly , then , in contrast to the mother , the fetus is not reckoned as a soul . ”
More than five decades later , a lot has changed . In that time , a concerted effort to place anti-abortion views at the core of the religious right has succeeded in rallying conservative Christians against reproductive rights .
But the success of the Christian anti-abortion movement has overshadowed another group of religious Americans : those who say that the right to abortion is part of their religion . This group includes Jews , Muslims , and even Christians who believe their faith allows—and sometimes even requires—abortion under certain circumstances . They say the right to abortion is a constitutional one , protected not only by the right to privacy , but by the freedom to exercise religion .
“ There 's a lot of folks who are pro-choice or support reproductive dignity and freedom because of their faith and not in spite of it , ” said Rev . Katey Zeh , an ordained Baptist minister and CEO of the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice .
As Roe v. Wade is threatened by increasingly restrictive state bills and a Supreme Court stacked against reproductive rights , pro-choice Jews , Muslims , and Christians may soon be forced to come to the legal defense of abortion in a way its never been argued before : as a religious right .
The clearest argument for abortion as a religious liberty belongs to the Jewish faith . Eighty-three percent of Jewish Americans say abortion should be legal , which makes them the most pro-abortion group of all affiliations , including the non-religious .
“ This is n't something that 's a huge controversy in the Jewish community , ” said Rabbi Danya Ruttenberg , who has authored two books on sex and feminism within Judaism . “ It is universally understood that there are times when abortion is actually required , according to Jewish law. ” This is the case when a pregnant person ’ s life is in danger . In that circumstance , there is consensus among Jewish decisors ( rabbis who decide on matters in Jewish law ) that an abortion is not just allowed but is necessary .
“ As long as the unborn remains a fetus , it does not have a status of personhood equal to its mother , and therefore may be sacrificed to save the life of the mother , ” wrote scholar and researcher Rabbi Yehuda Shurpin . In Judaism , the fetus is regarded as a part of the mother , “ like a hand or a foot , ” Rabbi Ruttenberg said .
These positions are largely based on Oholot 7:6 , which reads :
A woman who was having trouble giving birth , they cut up the fetus inside her and take it out limb by limb , because her life comes before its life .
In this circumstance , if the government were to deny an abortion to a Jewish person , many Jewish authorities argue that the government would be preventing them from exercising the duties of their faith . “ If you make it impossible for them to have this procedure then you are saying that your law is more important than my life , your law is more important than my traditions and commandments to our people , ” Rabbi Ruttenberg said .
While there is a near consensus on abortion in cases where a pregnancy endangers a person ’ s life , attitudes on abortion in other cases differ among Jewish authorities . Some believe abortion is permissible if having a child will cause a mother extreme suffering or distress , while others prefer to judge circumstances individually .
“ There are a lot of even ultra-Orthodox decisors that say if this pregnancy is going to cause the woman pain , suffering of some kind—and there 's understanding that sometimes suffering is material , sometimes suffering is mental—that is something that our tradition says is a reason to have an abortion , ” Rabbi Ruttenberg said .
In the United States , Reform and Conservative Jewish groups have been strong supporters of the broad legalization of abortion since before Roe v. Wade . The founder of the Jane Collective , one of the first underground abortion access networks , was a Jewish woman named Heather Booth . While Orthodox organizations supporting the broad legalization of abortion are less common , they too have been involved in abortion politics . Notably , in 2016 , the ultra-Orthodox group Agudath Israel of America sent a letter to the governor stating their opposition to an Ohio bill that proposed restricting abortion at six weeks . The bill , they said , would violate their religious freedom .
Though perhaps the strongest evidence for abortion as a religious right belongs to Judaism , it is not the only religion under which abortion is permitted .
Many Muslims , for example , believe in the permissability of abortion under specific circumstances—though opinions on abortion in Islam vary depending who you ask . “ Various forms of Muslim religious authority do n't always agree on the permissibility of abortion and under what circumstances it would be permissible , ” said Zahra Ayubi , an assistant professor of gender and Islamic bioethics at Dartmouth College .
Still , there are some perspectives on abortion in Islam that are more mainstream than others , like the belief that abortion before the fifth month of pregnancy is permissable . This opinion is largely based on a Hadith that says the ensoulment of a fetus occurs 120 days after conception .
Similar to Judaism , many Muslims also believe in life-saving abortion . “ In a scenario in which there is fatal harm to the mother , I would say a majority of Muslim authority figures would agree abortion would be permissible , ” Ayubi said .
While there are certainly anti-abortion Muslims , for Muslims who are pro-choice “ because of their faith and not in spite of it ” —as Rev . Zeh put it—banning life-saving abortion or abortion before 17 weeks , or 120 days , could be considered infringing on their religious freedoms . And a reality in which that happens isn ’ t far-fetched : in 2019 , six states passed six to eight week abortion bans that have been blocked from becoming law—so far .
Also last year , Alabama , which has one of the highest Muslim populations in the country , passed a temporarily blocked abortion ban that prohibits abortion at all stages of a pregnancy and even in the case of rape or incest , making only one exception for the endangerment of the mother ’ s life . In response , local and national Jewish groups and figures largely condemned the ban .
Like in Islam , many Buddhists and Hindus disagree on the permissability of abortion within their respective religions . Still , the majority of Muslims , Buddhists , and Hindus in America support legal abortion .
As Catholicism and evangelicalism dominate the conversation on abortion and religion within the U.S. , pro-choice Christian voices , like that of Rev . Zeh , have been drowned out .
“ As a follower of Christianity , as a minister of Christianity , ” she said , “ to me the core message is really about , first of all , love and compassion and care for the neighbor but also really eliminating systems of oppression no matter what kind they are . ”
Though Christian scripture does not mention abortion specifically , popular attitudes towards abortion in Christianity have changed with the ages , as ordained minister Rebecca Todd Peters points out in her book Trust Women : A Progressive Christian Argument for Reproductive Justice . “ Abortion is not a major topic of concern in the church until the late twentieth century , ” she writes .
It was then that a political—not theological—effort was made by Republicans , specifically Richard Nixon , to recruit Catholic Democratic voters by polarizing the issue of abortion . Evangelicals and Protestants later followed as a result of targeted political campaigns hoping to unite Christians under conservative cultural issues . In the late 1960s , very few evangelical Protestants mobilized alongside Catholics against abortion . Today , 77 percent of white , evangelical Protestants say abortion should be illegal in all or most cases , even more than Catholics , who fall at 56 percent , according to the Pew Research Center .
Rev . Zeh sees her work at the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice as a continuation of her religious tradition . The organization follows in the footsteps of groups like the Clergy Consultation Service on Abortion , a group of Protestant ministers and Jewish rabbis who opened a clinic in 1970 in order to provide affordable and accessible abortion to women .
In other words , advocacy for abortion as a religious right is not new . The religious right , Zeh said , “ does n't speak for everybody . But it 's almost served as an erasure of the prophetic work that people were doing , you know , before the 1980s . We 're trying to disrupt the idea that religion equals anti-choice . ”","When evangelical professor Bruce Waltke shared a standard biblical interpretation in favor of abortion in 1968, his words were hardly controversial.

The clearest argument for abortion as a religious liberty belongs to the Jewish faith. Eighty-three percent of Jewish Americans say abortion should be legal, which makes them the most pro-abortion group of all affiliations, including the non-religious.

“This isn't something that's a huge controversy in the Jewish community,” said Rabbi Danya Ruttenberg, who has authored two books on sex and feminism within Judaism. “It is universally understood that there are times when abortion is actually required, according to Jewish law.” This is the case when a pregnant person’s life is in danger. In that circumstance, there is consensus among Jewish decisors (rabbis who decide on matters in Jewish law) that an abortion is not just allowed but is necessary.

Abortion as a religious right in Christianity

As Catholicism and evangelicalism dominate the conversation on abortion and religion within the U.S., pro-choice Christian voices, like that of Rev. Zeh, have been drowned out.

“As a follower of Christianity, as a minister of Christianity,” she said, “to me the core message is really about, first of all, love and compassion and care for the neighbor but also really eliminating systems of oppression no matter what kind they are.”

Though Christian scripture does not mention abortion specifically, popular attitudes towards abortion in Christianity have changed with the ages, as ordained minister Rebecca Todd Peters points out in her book Trust Women: A Progressive Christian Argument for Reproductive Justice. “Abortion is not a major topic of concern in the church until the late twentieth century,” she writes.

It was then that a political—not theological—effort was made by Republicans, specifically Richard Nixon, to recruit Catholic Democratic voters by polarizing the issue of abortion. Evangelicals and Protestants later followed as a result of targeted political campaigns hoping to unite Christians under conservative cultural issues. In the late 1960s, very few evangelical Protestants mobilized alongside Catholics against abortion. Today, 77 percent of white, evangelical Protestants say abortion should be illegal in all or most cases, even more than Catholics, who fall at 56 percent, according to the Pew Research Center.

Rev. Zeh sees her work at the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice as a continuation of her religious tradition. The organization follows in the footsteps of groups like the Clergy Consultation Service on Abortion, a group of Protestant ministers and Jewish rabbis who opened a clinic in 1970 in order to provide affordable and accessible abortion to women.

In other words, advocacy for abortion as a religious right is not new. The religious right, Zeh said, “doesn't speak for everybody. But it's almost served as an erasure of the prophetic work that people were doing, you know, before the 1980s. We're trying to disrupt the idea that religion equals anti-choice.”",www.vice.com,left,gt8J3kX95l6nTUHP

He says his strength in the past few months `` has deteriorated ''
A new pope should be chosen by Easter , a spokesman says
No more than 117 cardinals will select the next pontiff
The spiritual leader of 1.2 billion Roman Catholics , Pope Benedict XVI , surprised the world Monday by saying he will resign at the end of the month `` because of advanced age . ''
It 's the first time a pope has stepped down in nearly 600 years .
`` Strength of mind and body are necessary , strength which in the last few months has deteriorated in me to the extent that I have had to recognize my incapacity to adequately fulfill the ministry entrusted to me , '' said Benedict , 85 , according to the Vatican .
The news startled the Catholic world and led to frenzied speculation about who would replace him , including a debate about the merits of naming a pontiff from the developing world , where the church continues to grow , versus one from Europe , where it has deep historical roots .
But that decision will not be made by Benedict , who will leave his post at 8 p.m. on February 28 , said the Rev . Federico Lombardi , a Vatican spokesman .

`` Before Easter , we will have the new pope , '' he said .
While Benedict wo n't be directly involved in his successor 's selection , his influence will undoubtedly be felt . He appointed 67 of the 117 cardinals that -- as of Monday -- are set to make the decision .
The number of electors could drop to 115 , as two cardinals will turn 80 in March , when their age makes them ineligible to cast a vote . More than two thirds of whatever the final number must agree on the next pope , a decision that will be announced to the world in the form a puff of white smoke emerging from a chimney in the Vatican .
CNN Senior Vatican Analyst John Allen said that means the next pope , no matter where he is from , will probably continue in Benedict 's conservative tradition , which has seen the church take a firm line on issues such as abortion , birth control and divorce .
The pope , born Joseph Ratzinger , will first head to the pope 's summer residence before he likely retires to a monastery and devotes himself to a life of reflection and prayer , Lombardi said . He wo n't be involved in managing the church after his resignation .
In a sign of just how rare an event this is , church officials are n't sure what the pope will be called after he leaves the office .
While not quite unprecedented , his resignation is certainly historic . The last pope to step down before his death was Gregory XII , who in 1415 quit to end a civil war within the church in which more than one man claimed to be pope .
Benedict took months to decide that he was n't up for the job anymore , Lombardi said .
`` It 's not a decision he has just improvised , '' the Vatican spokesman said .
A family friend in Regensburg , Germany , told CNN that Benedict had been thinking resigning for some time because of his age . He had discussed the decision with his older brother , the Rev . Georg Ratzinger , according to the friend , who asked not to be named because he does not speak for Georg Ratzinger .

Several years ago , Benedict had suggested he would be open to resigning should his health fail , Allen said . But no one expected him to do so this soon .
Jannet Walsh , a CNN iReporter from Murdock , Minnesota , counts herself among those `` shocked '' by the news of his resignation . But she said it was an admirable decision because he seemingly recognized that he could not adequately `` carry out his office as pope '' given his health .
`` The resignation of the pope is actually a very selfless act , and it should be applauded , '' Walsh said .
Joseph Ratzinger was born and raised in Germany , where he briefly served in the Hitler Youth , despite his objections , and the German military during World War II . He then established himself as a leading theologian , professor and local Catholic leader before rising up the Vatican ranks .
He was dean of the College of Cardinals in 2005 when he became the sixth German to be picked as pope , albeit the first since the 11th century . At the time , the church was facing several pressing issues , including declining popularity in parts of the world and a growing crisis over the church 's role in handling molestation accusations against priests around the world .
Given his age at the time -- 78 -- he was widely seen as a caretaker pope , a bridge to the next generation after the long tenure of John Paul II , a popular , globe-trotting pontiff whose early youth and vigor gave way to such frailty in later years that he required help walking and was often hard to hear during public addresses .
As an aide to John Paul , Benedict served as a strict enforcer of his conservative social doctrine . To no one 's surprise , he continued to espouse a conservative doctrine after taking the office himself . He frequently warned of a `` dictatorship of relativism . ''
`` In a world which he considered relativist and secular and so on , his main thrust was to re-establish a sense of Catholic identity for Catholics themselves , '' said Delia Gallagher , contributing editor for Inside the Vatican magazine .
Not everyone embraced this conservatism . CNN iReporter Egberto Willies , a former Catholic , said positions such as opposing the distribution of condoms to curb the AIDS epidemic in Africa shows how `` outdated '' the church under Benedict was .
`` This is a pope that was so conservative that many of his values simply , in today 's world , made no sense , '' said Willies , a resident of Kingwood , Texas .
Bill Donohue , of the conservative U.S. Catholic League , credited Benedict for working to reduce friction among adherents of various faiths , something that was a key part of John Paul 's mission as well .
`` The pope made it clear that religious freedom was not only a God-given right , it was 'the path to peace , ' '' Donohue said .
But Mohammed Shafiq , chief executive of the Ramadhan Foundation , offered a different take . He referenced a 2006 speech Benedict made in which he quoted from 14th century Byzantine emperor Manuel II Paleologus saying the Muslim Prophet Mohammed brought into the world `` things only evil and inhuman . '' These remarks spurred protests by Muslims worldwide and an apology from the pope .
`` This sadly meant the hard work of his predecessor Pope John Paul II was tarnished and required extensive work to rebuild ties between Christianity and Islam , '' Shafiq said . `` That is something he has tried to do over the past eight years , and we do wish it could have started better than it did . ''
In his tone , demeanor and actions , Benedict was notably different from his predecessor . Where John Paul wowed crowds around the world with his mastery of numerous languages , Benedict 's influence will be felt through his writings , part of his training as a college professor , Gallagher said .
Benedict became pope at the height of the molestation scandal involving Catholic priests , with complaints of sexual abuse and lawsuits over the issue tearing at the church and threatening its moral standing around the world .
In 2008 , he acknowledged `` the shame which we have all felt '' over abuse reports and said those responsible for the `` evils '' should face justice . Two years later in 2010 -- the same year that he issued new rules aimed at stopping abuse -- he said abusive priests `` disfigured their ministry '' and brought `` profound shame and regret '' on the church .
The new rules included allowing church prosecution of suspected molesters for 20 years after the incidents occurred , up from 10 years previously . The rules also made it a church crime to download child pornography and allowed the pope to remove a priest without a formal Vatican trial .
`` No one did more to successfully address the problem of priestly sexual abuse than Joseph Ratzinger , '' Donohue said .
But others -- such as Barbara Blaine , president of Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests -- say the opposite is true .
`` I would hate for him to be remembered as someone who did the right thing because from our perspective , Pope Benedict 's record has been abysmal , '' Blaine said .
In 2010 , The New York Times reported that church officials , including Ratzinger , had failed to act in the case of a Wisconsin priest accused of molesting up to 200 boys . The Times reported that church officials stopped proceedings against the priest after he wrote Ratzinger , who was at the time the cardinal in charge of the group that oversees Catholic Church doctrine .
Ratzinger never answered the letter , according to the Times , and church officials have said he had no knowledge of the situation . But a lawyer who obtained internal church paperwork said at the time that it `` shows a direct line from the victims through the bishops and directly to the man who is now pope . ''
Also in 2010 , the Times reported that the future pope -- while serving as the archbishop in Munich -- had been copied on a memo informing him that a priest accused of molesting children was being returned to pastoral work . At the time , a spokesman for the archdiocese said Ratzinger received hundreds of memos a year , and it was highly unlikely that he had read it .
Victims ' groups are pressing the International Criminal Court to prosecute Benedict in the sex abuse scandal and say the resignation wo n't change that , according to Pam Spees , of the public policy law firm Center for Constitutional Rights , which is helping SNAP pursue the case .
In a statement issued Monday , Blaine said the church should choose a new pope dedicated to preventing sexual abuse by priests .
`` For the church to truly embody the spiritual teachings of Jesus Christ , it must be led by a pontiff who demands transparency , exposes child-molesting clerics , punishes wrongdoers and enablers , cooperates with law enforcement and makes true amends to those who were hurt so greatly by Catholic priests , employees and volunteers , '' she said .
For others , the next pope must be someone who not only can satisfactorily address this scandal and other issues , but he also must be able to speak to all Catholics and others -- especially younger people -- in a way that resonates with them .
`` I know that my grandparents think of the whole church a little bit differently than my generation does , '' said Kaleigh Forst , a student , in New York City . `` I feel like we could use somebody maybe a little younger , that has a new perspective . ''
Whatever his past , few expected Benedict to announce he was stepping down , including world and Catholic leaders , who voiced admiration for his decision and the man himself .
U.S. Vice President Joe Biden , himself a Catholic , said he thought the pope set `` an incredibly high standard '' by understanding his own limitations and how they might affect the church .
`` The decision reinforces for me as a practicing Catholic that this is a man of great integrity and looking out for what he believes is in the best interest of our church , '' Biden said . `` I admire him for it . ''
British Prime Minister David Cameron said Benedict `` will be missed as a spiritual leader to millions. `` Cameron 's Irish counterpart , Enda Kenny , praised Benedict for decades of leadership and service , as well as his decision to resign .
`` It reflects his profound sense of duty to the Church , and also his deep appreciation of the unique pressures of spiritual leadership in the modern world , '' Kenny said in a prepared statement .
Archbishop Vincent Nichols , the president of the Catholic Bishops ' Conference of England and Wales , said the decision `` shocked and surprised everyone . ''
`` Yet , on reflection , I am sure that many will recognize it to be a decision of great courage and characteristic clarity of mind and action , '' he said .
`` It 's like watching your own Dad get old and admit he 's not up to all the duties that being the head of a family involves , '' Dolan said . `` And there 's a somberness , there 's a sadness there . ''","Story highlights Pope Benedict XVI surprises the world with his decision to step down

He says his strength in the past few months ""has deteriorated""

A new pope should be chosen by Easter, a spokesman says

No more than 117 cardinals will select the next pontiff

The spiritual leader of 1.2 billion Roman Catholics, Pope Benedict XVI, surprised the world Monday by saying he will resign at the end of the month ""because of advanced age.""

It's the first time a pope has stepped down in nearly 600 years.

""Strength of mind and body are necessary, strength which in the last few months has deteriorated in me to the extent that I have had to recognize my incapacity to adequately fulfill the ministry entrusted to me,"" said Benedict, 85, according to the Vatican.

The news startled the Catholic world and led to frenzied speculation about who would replace him, including a debate about the merits of naming a pontiff from the developing world, where the church continues to grow, versus one from Europe, where it has deep historical roots.

But that decision will not be made by Benedict, who will leave his post at 8 p.m. on February 28, said the Rev. Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman.

""Before Easter, we will have the new pope,"" he said.

While Benedict won't be directly involved in his successor's selection, his influence will undoubtedly be felt. He appointed 67 of the 117 cardinals that -- as of Monday -- are set to make the decision.

The number of electors could drop to 115, as two cardinals will turn 80 in March, when their age makes them ineligible to cast a vote. More than two thirds of whatever the final number must agree on the next pope, a decision that will be announced to the world in the form a puff of white smoke emerging from a chimney in the Vatican.

CNN Senior Vatican Analyst John Allen said that means the next pope, no matter where he is from, will probably continue in Benedict's conservative tradition, which has seen the church take a firm line on issues such as abortion, birth control and divorce.

Resignation 'not a decision he has just improvised'

The pope, born Joseph Ratzinger, will first head to the pope's summer residence before he likely retires to a monastery and devotes himself to a life of reflection and prayer, Lombardi said. He won't be involved in managing the church after his resignation.

In a sign of just how rare an event this is, church officials aren't sure what the pope will be called after he leaves the office.

One possibility, Allen said, is ""bishop emeritus of Rome.""

While not quite unprecedented, his resignation is certainly historic. The last pope to step down before his death was Gregory XII, who in 1415 quit to end a civil war within the church in which more than one man claimed to be pope.

Benedict took months to decide that he wasn't up for the job anymore, Lombardi said.

""It's not a decision he has just improvised,"" the Vatican spokesman said.

A family friend in Regensburg, Germany, told CNN that Benedict had been thinking resigning for some time because of his age. He had discussed the decision with his older brother, the Rev. Georg Ratzinger, according to the friend, who asked not to be named because he does not speak for Georg Ratzinger.

Several years ago, Benedict had suggested he would be open to resigning should his health fail, Allen said. But no one expected him to do so this soon.

Jannet Walsh, a CNN iReporter from Murdock, Minnesota, counts herself among those ""shocked"" by the news of his resignation. But she said it was an admirable decision because he seemingly recognized that he could not adequately ""carry out his office as pope"" given his health.

""The resignation of the pope is actually a very selfless act, and it should be applauded,"" Walsh said.

Benedict's legacy

Joseph Ratzinger was born and raised in Germany, where he briefly served in the Hitler Youth, despite his objections, and the German military during World War II. He then established himself as a leading theologian, professor and local Catholic leader before rising up the Vatican ranks.

He was dean of the College of Cardinals in 2005 when he became the sixth German to be picked as pope, albeit the first since the 11th century. At the time, the church was facing several pressing issues, including declining popularity in parts of the world and a growing crisis over the church's role in handling molestation accusations against priests around the world.

Given his age at the time -- 78 -- he was widely seen as a caretaker pope, a bridge to the next generation after the long tenure of John Paul II, a popular, globe-trotting pontiff whose early youth and vigor gave way to such frailty in later years that he required help walking and was often hard to hear during public addresses.

As an aide to John Paul, Benedict served as a strict enforcer of his conservative social doctrine. To no one's surprise, he continued to espouse a conservative doctrine after taking the office himself. He frequently warned of a ""dictatorship of relativism.""

""In a world which he considered relativist and secular and so on, his main thrust was to re-establish a sense of Catholic identity for Catholics themselves,"" said Delia Gallagher, contributing editor for Inside the Vatican magazine.

Not everyone embraced this conservatism. CNN iReporter Egberto Willies , a former Catholic, said positions such as opposing the distribution of condoms to curb the AIDS epidemic in Africa shows how ""outdated"" the church under Benedict was.

""This is a pope that was so conservative that many of his values simply, in today's world, made no sense,"" said Willies, a resident of Kingwood, Texas.

Bill Donohue, of the conservative U.S. Catholic League, credited Benedict for working to reduce friction among adherents of various faiths, something that was a key part of John Paul's mission as well.

""The pope made it clear that religious freedom was not only a God-given right, it was 'the path to peace,'"" Donohue said.

But Mohammed Shafiq, chief executive of the Ramadhan Foundation, offered a different take. He referenced a 2006 speech Benedict made in which he quoted from 14th century Byzantine emperor Manuel II Paleologus saying the Muslim Prophet Mohammed brought into the world ""things only evil and inhuman."" These remarks spurred protests by Muslims worldwide and an apology from the pope.

""This sadly meant the hard work of his predecessor Pope John Paul II was tarnished and required extensive work to rebuild ties between Christianity and Islam,"" Shafiq said. ""That is something he has tried to do over the past eight years, and we do wish it could have started better than it did.""

In his tone, demeanor and actions, Benedict was notably different from his predecessor. Where John Paul wowed crowds around the world with his mastery of numerous languages, Benedict's influence will be felt through his writings, part of his training as a college professor, Gallagher said.

Allen called Benedict a ""great teaching pope.""

Praised, criticized for actions regarding sex abuse

Benedict became pope at the height of the molestation scandal involving Catholic priests, with complaints of sexual abuse and lawsuits over the issue tearing at the church and threatening its moral standing around the world.

In 2008, he acknowledged ""the shame which we have all felt"" over abuse reports and said those responsible for the ""evils"" should face justice. Two years later in 2010 -- the same year that he issued new rules aimed at stopping abuse -- he said abusive priests ""disfigured their ministry"" and brought ""profound shame and regret"" on the church.

The new rules included allowing church prosecution of suspected molesters for 20 years after the incidents occurred, up from 10 years previously. The rules also made it a church crime to download child pornography and allowed the pope to remove a priest without a formal Vatican trial.

""No one did more to successfully address the problem of priestly sexual abuse than Joseph Ratzinger,"" Donohue said.

But others -- such as Barbara Blaine, president of Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests -- say the opposite is true.

""I would hate for him to be remembered as someone who did the right thing because from our perspective, Pope Benedict's record has been abysmal,"" Blaine said.

In 2010, The New York Times reported that church officials, including Ratzinger, had failed to act in the case of a Wisconsin priest accused of molesting up to 200 boys. The Times reported that church officials stopped proceedings against the priest after he wrote Ratzinger, who was at the time the cardinal in charge of the group that oversees Catholic Church doctrine.

Ratzinger never answered the letter, according to the Times, and church officials have said he had no knowledge of the situation. But a lawyer who obtained internal church paperwork said at the time that it ""shows a direct line from the victims through the bishops and directly to the man who is now pope.""

Also in 2010, the Times reported that the future pope -- while serving as the archbishop in Munich -- had been copied on a memo informing him that a priest accused of molesting children was being returned to pastoral work. At the time, a spokesman for the archdiocese said Ratzinger received hundreds of memos a year, and it was highly unlikely that he had read it.

Victims' groups are pressing the International Criminal Court to prosecute Benedict in the sex abuse scandal and say the resignation won't change that, according to Pam Spees, of the public policy law firm Center for Constitutional Rights, which is helping SNAP pursue the case.

In a statement issued Monday, Blaine said the church should choose a new pope dedicated to preventing sexual abuse by priests.

""For the church to truly embody the spiritual teachings of Jesus Christ, it must be led by a pontiff who demands transparency, exposes child-molesting clerics, punishes wrongdoers and enablers, cooperates with law enforcement and makes true amends to those who were hurt so greatly by Catholic priests, employees and volunteers,"" she said.

For others, the next pope must be someone who not only can satisfactorily address this scandal and other issues, but he also must be able to speak to all Catholics and others -- especially younger people -- in a way that resonates with them.

""I know that my grandparents think of the whole church a little bit differently than my generation does,"" said Kaleigh Forst, a student, in New York City. ""I feel like we could use somebody maybe a little younger, that has a new perspective.""

World, Catholic leaders express surprise, admiration

There have been at least 10 anti-Semitic attacks in the New York area during the holiday celebrations , but many of the city ’ s Jewish residents remain most stunned by a machete-wielding man who burst into a rabbi ’ s home during Hanukkah . In New York , anti-Semitic hate crimes were 63 % higher in 2019 than in 2018 , officials say . One of the most disturbing aspects of this particular epidemic of violent anti-Semitism , experts say , is that it transcends ideological boundaries .
“ People were always quite comfortable here , ” says Rabbi Romiel Daniel . He notes that Jews in the United States , and in New York City in particular , have always felt an unprecedented level of inclusion . “ But suddenly in the last two or three years , the climate has changed . It is something where you tend to always look over your back all the time . ”
More than half the residents in this part of Queens are part of the kaleidoscope of Jewish traditions represented in New York . And yet the Rego Park Jewish Center found it necessary to install bulletproof doors and other security measures .
Rabbi Romiel Daniel felt something particularly poignant this Hanukkah season as he and his congregation sang the words of “ Ma ’ oz Tsur , ” a 13th-century Hebrew poem that is sung each night during the ceremonial lighting of the menorah ’ s candles .
“ It is a song about the victory of the weak over the strong , a victory of good over evil , a victory of the holy over the unholy , as such , ” says Rabbi Daniel , head of the Rego Park Jewish Center , a synagogue in Queens . “ It ’ s about the fact that all this was possible , not because of man ’ s strength at all , but because God was on our side . ”
But Ma ’ oz Tsur , which recounts the history of God ’ s saving acts and is often translated as “ Rock of Ages , ” also carries a lamentation : “ Our salvation takes too long , and there is no end to the bad days , ” worshippers sing in the final stanza .
There have been at least 10 anti-Semitic attacks in the New York region during this year ’ s holiday celebrations , officials say , but many of the city ’ s Jewish residents remain most stunned by the attack of a machete-wielding man who burst into a rabbi ’ s home in Monsey Saturday evening , injuring five of a group who had gathered to celebrate the seventh night of Hanukkah .
The attack came 2 1/2 weeks after a pair of assailants in Jersey City , New Jersey , a man and a woman , targeted a kosher supermarket in a Jewish neighborhood , shooting and killing four , including a police officer . Since then , Jewish residents , most of them from Orthodox and Hasidic communities , have been accosted on the streets .
This April , a gunman shot and killed a worshipper in an attack on a synagogue in Poway , California , wounding three others . In October 2018 , a gunman stormed into Pittsburgh ’ s Tree of Life synagogue , killing 11 and wounding six .
“ We can not overstate the fear people are feeling right now , ” tweeted New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio , who called the recent acts of anti-Semitic violence a crisis and a nationwide epidemic . “ I ’ ve spoken to longtime friends who , for the first time in their lives , are fearful to show outward signs of their Jewish faith . ”
Such feelings , says Rabbi Daniel , have come as a shock for many of the members of his synagogue , who include a number of Holocaust survivors , such as the Jewish Center ’ s chairwoman , Ruth Lowenstein , who witnessed the burning of her family ’ s synagogue in Berlin .
More than half the residents in this part of Queens are part of the kaleidoscope of Jewish traditions represented in New York , which include many different Hasidic and Orthodox traditions , as well as Conservative , Reform , and secular . Tens of thousands of Russian-speaking Bukharan Jews from Uzbekistan and Tajikistan have also made their homes here .
“ People were always quite comfortable here – even I have always been very comfortable here , to tell you frankly , ” says Rabbi Daniel . He notes , as others have , that Jewish people in the United States , and in New York City in particular , have always felt an unprecedented level of inclusion and equality when compared with other countries , and other times of history .
“ But suddenly in the last two or three years , the climate has changed , ” he says . “ It is something where you tend to always look over your back all the time . It ’ s a constant feeling , that it is not as safe as it should be , even here . ”
His synagogue decided to install a series of bulletproof glass doors a few years ago , just inside the ornate outer doors . Visitors are now required to buzz into the office and school , along with other security protocols .
Indeed , as the Monitor reported in 2018 , there has been a reawakening of overt and violent anti-Semitism throughout the United States and Europe . In New York City , anti-Semitic hate crimes are up 63 % this year , officials say , with 152 reports of crimes in 2019 , compared with 93 in 2018 .
“ We are in some ways where we have always been , which is that humans are prewired to see an us and a them , ” says Ken Stern , an expert on anti-Semitism at Bard College in New York . “ And there are lots of messages in society from politics , from media and other places , that reinforce that sort of view of the world – that we ’ re not all one big happy human family , but we are looking and highlighting and searching for differences . ”
“ Anti-Semitism is one of those manifestations of that world view , ” continues Professor Stern , “ because historically Jews are seen as an other , a danger , and conspiring to harm non-Jews . We do know that when there is a glorification of the us versus them mentality , anti-Semitism is always going to rise . ”
But one of the most disturbing aspects of this particular epidemic of violent anti-Semitism , many experts say , is the fact that it is transcending ideological and cultural boundaries . Even though many of the attacks can be linked to neo-Nazis and classic white supremacists , it has been coming from many other parts of society as well .
“ On the radical right , they often glorify violence , ” says Gunther Jikeli , who studies the history of anti-Semitism at Indiana University Bloomington . “ When you saw how the radical right were discussing the Pittsburgh shootings , nobody questioned the violence . They either glorified the murderer or said , ‘ Oh , he ’ s stupid , just killing elderly Jews . ’ ”
“ On the left , it ’ s more to do with their worldview of anti-imperialism and anticolonialism , where the Jews are somehow in line with imperialists and the colonialism of the state of Israel , ” says Professor Jikeli . “ You have American college campuses where pro- or even neutral Israeli sentiments are attacked in the name of ideology that has its roots in Mao , Che Guevara , and Third World-ism . ”
At the same time , the violence can not be bifurcated into easy right- and left-wing political categories , observers say .
“ While we have seen an increase in extremist movements , we ’ re also seeing new groupings of possible extremists that either aren ’ t clearly identifiable , or who are a mixture , ” says Brian Levin , director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University , San Bernardino . “ We saw that with the El Paso terrorist , who borrowed from ecofascism and [ fears of ] automation . ”
“ Today ’ s world is not this boxed lunch , but everything is spilled over with each other , ” says Mr. Levin . “ There is anti-Semitism on the left , misogyny being shared by fundamentalists and nationalists of all stripes , ecofascism , and appropriations of cultural symbols . ”
The attacks this holiday season have drawn attention to the anti-Semitism within many black communities , which also manifests in varying ways , experts say .
One of the Jersey City assailants was a member of the Black Hebrew Israelites , more than 100 branches of which have been designated as hate groups according to the Southern Poverty Law Center . After the shooting rampage , one of the city ’ s Board of Education trustees , Joan Terrell-Paige , disparaged the outpouring of grief and support for the Hasidic community .
“ Where was all this faith and hope when Black homeowners were threatened , intimidated , and harassed by I WANT TO BUY YOUR HOUSE brutes of the Jewish community ? ” Ms. Terrell-Paige wrote in a lengthy Facebook post . Though her words praising the attackers sparked outrage and calls for her resignation , she told reporters she did not regret what she said .
“ Anti-Semitic ideas ... they can be on the radical right , but they are also available in other forms on the left and in other forms in African-American communities , ” says Professor Jikeli , author of “ Muslim Antisemitism in Europe. ” “ These boundaries to voicing anti-Semitism are not as high as they were 10 or 20 years ago . ”
“ The media has difficulty in addressing that and naming this group of perpetrators , ” he continues . “ That means that the boundaries are less high for those on the margins than for others , ” a phenomenon he often sees in similarly marginalized communities in Europe .
The lowering of such boundaries can also be seen throughout the kind of discourse that has risen within the anonymity of the digital age , its increasingly siloed communities , and the rise of nationalism throughout the globe , many observers say .
“ The people who are most susceptible to fear – and that includes people with mental conditions and the angriest among us – the more that fear is validated by a bully pulpit and overall coarse political milieu , that makes this a wildfire that crosses both sides of the ideological ridge , ” says Mr. Levin .
Responding to Jewish leaders , officials in New York have bolstered the police presence in many majority Jewish neighborhoods , and civic groups such as the Guardian Angels have announced they would also be patrolling areas where many of the attacks have occurred .
Yes , the fear is potent , and his people have felt such fear for millennia , says Rabbi Daniel . But that ’ s the precise meaning of this year ’ s just-completed holiday celebrations , and the song they sing each of the eight nights they light the menorah .

Shortly before midday a marching band headed along the main avenue towards the Vatican. Police officers shepherded back onlookers who got too close.

Thousands of tourists and pilgrims then walked the short distance to St Peter's Square. They looked up to the balcony of the Basilica. Those at the back looked at video screens set up on either side of the square.

The crowd cheered as the Pope stepped out to deliver his Christmas message to the city and the world. He spoke quietly in Italian. He called for peace in a number of conflicts - in the Middle East and Africa in particular.

The Pope's calls for peace are not new. Throughout the year, he delivers regular appeals for an end to conflict during his Sunday Angelus blessing given from the window of his official apartment in the Vatican.

On Christmas Day, the Pope makes the same call. But his stage - and his audience - are much bigger.

In his Christmas Day address, he also asked for peace in Ukraine, Nigeria, in Libya, South Sudan and other parts of Africa.

He called for comfort for the families of the 132 children killed in a Taliban attack in Pakistan last week - and for the victims of the Ebola epidemic.

On Wednesday he made a surprise telephone call to refugees in a camp near Irbil, in Iraq's northern Kurdistan region.

""You are like Jesus on Christmas night. There was no room for him either,"" he told them.

The skeptical brain may hold the answer,2015-07-05,Lala Stone,"Christopher Obal used to be a Christian . He grew up in Queens , New York , and when he was 5 years old , his parents left Catholicism for a very different form of Christianity . While they didn ’ t claim a specific denomination , he said the churches they went to would probably be described as Pentecostal , evangelical and charismatic .
“ We attended churches where people spoke in tongues , and believed in the gifts of the spirit as well as a God who spoke to his people frequently , ” he said .
As an adolescent Obal was obsessed with discovering God ’ s plan for his life and doing God ’ s will . At the age of 18 , he attended Oral Roberts University , a conservative Christian college in Tulsa , Oklahoma . But while at college , he began to question his beliefs . Now , while he ’ s open to the possibility of “ god , gods , goddesses , aliens , universal consciousness , or whatever , ” he ’ s not affiliated with any religion . The rest of his family remains devoutly religious .
Obal is one of only a small percentage of Americans who grew up in religious households and are now religion-free . A 2008 report by the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life found that only 12.7 percent of people raised in a particular faith eventually become unaffiliated with any religious group . Why did Obal abandon Christianity , while his friends and family remained faithful ?
As with many things regarding human nature , the answer is complicated . But a good place to start is the nature of belief itself .
It ’ s no surprise that most Americans believe in God , according to science writer and skeptic Michael Shermer . In his book “ The Believing Brain , ” he explains how belief was beneficial to human evolution . He said that “ the tendency to find patterns in both meaningful and meaningless noise ” -- or , as he calls it , `` patternicity '' -- developed as a way to keep humans alive .
He gives the example of an early human hearing a “ rustle in the grass. ” Is it a hungry predator or is it the wind ? If the person assumes it ’ s a hungry predator but it ’ s actually the wind , he or she will come to no harm . But if the person believes it ’ s the wind when it ’ s actually a hungry predator , it could mean death . So , the tendency to be overly cautious and falsely believe leads to being able to pass on those cautious , believing genes . Or , as Shermer puts it , “ we are the descendants of those who were most successful at finding patterns . ”
Shermer adds that once humans see the patterns , they tend to infuse them with “ meaning , intention , and agency. ” He calls this `` agenticity . '' How does this lead to supernatural belief ?
“ God is the ultimate pattern that explains everything that happens , ” he wrote , “ the ultimate intentional agent . ”
Shermer cites studies that show a heavy “ genetic influence on intentional belief. ” And he says that “ people who grow up in religious families and later become religious do so because they have inherited a disposition to resonate positively with religious sentiments . ”
In the popular book “ The God Gene , ” American geneticist Dean Hamer proposed something similar . He said that “ we have a genetic predisposition for spiritual belief that is expressed in response to , and shaped by , personal experience and the cultural environment . ”
Belief was a positive development for the evolution of our species , and we haven ’ t evolved beyond it . According to a May Gallup poll , 86 percent of Americans believe in God . The question now becomes : Why doesn ’ t everyone believe in God ?
Many researchers have asked this same question . Some studies suggest that a skeptical brain works differently than a believing brain . One example is a 2012 study titled “ Is it Just a Brick Wall or a Sign From the Universe : An fMRI Study of Supernatural Believers and Skeptics. ” In this experiment , the participants ’ brain activity was monitored while they read a scenario , then looked at a picture . They were asked what thoughts that image would evoke if they were in that scenario , then saw that picture on a poster as they were walking down the street .
For example , imagine you just had a job interview . You walk down the street , and see a poster of a business suit . How would that make you feel ? What does that poster mean ? The supernaturally inclined were more likely to see it as a meaningful omen , a sign that they would get the job . The skeptics in the group did not see any significance in the image .
The researchers found that one region of the brain ( the right inferior frontal gyrus ) “ was activated more strongly in skeptics than in supernatural believers. ” The more active that part of the brain , the less likely participants were to find supernatural meaning in the images . The researchers think this is because the active region of the brain is associated with cognitive inhibition .
Cognitive inhibition is the mind ’ s ability to stop or override a certain mental process -- the ability to stop unwanted thoughts , for example , or to weed out irrelevant information . One example of where cognitive inhibition is useful is in overcoming prejudice . If people want to avoid discriminating , they need to inhibit or suppress any negative stereotypes they might have toward a certain group of people .
For the people in the study , seeing a business suit in a poster was not logically connected to their chances of getting the job in any way . Still , supernatural believers found meaning there . They weren ’ t willing ( or able ) to suppress the thought that “ this is a sign I will get the job. ” The findings of this study supported the researchers ’ hypothesis that “ a skeptical attitude toward supernatural phenomena is associated with stronger cognitive inhibition. ” And , as many skeptics formerly held supernatural beliefs , the researchers propose that “ developmental increases in cognitive inhibition may be among the factors that contribute to the decline of these beliefs . ”
It may have been just this that led Elizabeth Cady , a former evangelical Christian currently living in San Francisco , to her current agnosticism . When asked what it was that made her change her beliefs , she had a quick response .
“ I had some gay friends in high school , ” she said , “ that got me into the questioning thing . ”
Forming a positive relationship with people who were condemned by her religion required that she inhibit her religious belief that “ homosexuality is bad. ” This led her to question other beliefs as well . She wouldn ’ t be able to question those beliefs if she wasn ’ t able to suppress her church teachings in the first place .
British blogger Jonny Scaramanga had a similar experience . Scaramanga grew up in in a fundamentalist Christian household in England and is now an atheist . His journey to atheism began with listening to secular music and being surprised at how he felt .
“ That music made me feel happier than Christian music ever had , which contradicted what I 'd been taught , ” he said . “ It also made me comfortable with listening to ideas I did n't agree with , and it made me feel like non-Christians were n't so bad . ”
This is another example of strong cognitive inhibition . He was able to suppress the belief that secular music was evil , and that led to his being able to entertain other ideas that conflicted with his religious beliefs .
Of course , one ’ s brain isn ’ t the only factor in whether or not someone is religious . The biggest factor in someone ’ s current religious belief is his or her parents ’ religious belief . As noted earlier , Shermer thinks this is mainly because of an inherited genetic predisposition . But Vern L. Bengtson and Norella M. Putney , the authors of the book “ Families and Faith : How Religion Is Passed Down Across Generations , ” have a different , more sociological approach . They looked at the progression of religious faith from parents to children in order to figure out “ what families should or should not do to be effective in sustaining religious continuity . ”
Not surprisingly , the biggest factor in parents being able to successfully pass on their religion to their children was their relationship with their children . The authors found that “ parents who interact with their children during their formative years in a warm , affirming and respectful manner are more likely to pass on their religious tradition , beliefs , and practices. ” Other things that aid successful transmission include having parents of the same faith who do not divorce and having a strong relationship with grandparents of the same faith .
On the other hand , religious conflict between parents and children was one of the most common routes from religion to atheism . If resistant children were forced into religious activities , they often rebelled as soon as they had the chance .
So , a child with weak cognitive inhibition and a positive relationship with his married parents of the same faith is likely to carry on in the religious family tradition . A child with strong cognitive inhibition who is forced to go to church against his will is likely to rebel .
Was the latter the case with Obal ? He shared his parents ’ belief as a child , but his parents “ bribed ” him into going to Oral Roberts University , so there was some religious conflict . As for cognitive inhibition ? Well , he did successfully inhibit his religious belief .
When asked what led to his change in beliefs , Obal has a long list of items that led to his disillusionment with religion . He worked at the Oral Roberts University Television station and said this experience led him to see that “ this whole world of TV evangelism and [ religious network ] Trinity Broadcasting was just a scam. ” Also , he saw many friends and family blindly support the war in Iraq after 9/11 and began to think they were influenced by propaganda instead of following God . This led him to question Christianity as a whole .
He gave some credit to a certain plant as well .
“ I started using marijuana , which opened my mind , ” he said . “ So my thought process became a bit more critical towards religion and the implausible cornerstones of faith . ”
Along with cognitive inhibition and familial transmission , this sounds like something that requires further research .

One example of where cognitive inhibition is useful is in overcoming prejudice. If people want to avoid discriminating, they need to inhibit or suppress any negative stereotypes they might have toward a certain group of people.

For the people in the study, seeing a business suit in a poster was not logically connected to their chances of getting the job in any way. Still, supernatural believers found meaning there. They weren’t willing (or able) to suppress the thought that “this is a sign I will get the job.” The findings of this study supported the researchers’ hypothesis that “a skeptical attitude toward supernatural phenomena is associated with stronger cognitive inhibition.” And, as many skeptics formerly held supernatural beliefs, the researchers propose that “developmental increases in cognitive inhibition may be among the factors that contribute to the decline of these beliefs.”

It may have been just this that led Elizabeth Cady, a former evangelical Christian currently living in San Francisco, to her current agnosticism. When asked what it was that made her change her beliefs, she had a quick response.

“I had some gay friends in high school,” she said, “that got me into the questioning thing.”

Forming a positive relationship with people who were condemned by her religion required that she inhibit her religious belief that “homosexuality is bad.” This led her to question other beliefs as well. She wouldn’t be able to question those beliefs if she wasn’t able to suppress her church teachings in the first place.

British blogger Jonny Scaramanga had a similar experience. Scaramanga grew up in in a fundamentalist Christian household in England and is now an atheist. His journey to atheism began with listening to secular music and being surprised at how he felt.

“That music made me feel happier than Christian music ever had, which contradicted what I'd been taught,” he said. “It also made me comfortable with listening to ideas I didn't agree with, and it made me feel like non-Christians weren't so bad.”

This is another example of strong cognitive inhibition. He was able to suppress the belief that secular music was evil, and that led to his being able to entertain other ideas that conflicted with his religious beliefs.

Of course, one’s brain isn’t the only factor in whether or not someone is religious. The biggest factor in someone’s current religious belief is his or her parents’ religious belief. As noted earlier, Shermer thinks this is mainly because of an inherited genetic predisposition. But Vern L. Bengtson and Norella M. Putney, the authors of the book “Families and Faith: How Religion Is Passed Down Across Generations,” have a different, more sociological approach. They looked at the progression of religious faith from parents to children in order to figure out “what families should or should not do to be effective in sustaining religious continuity.”

Not surprisingly, the biggest factor in parents being able to successfully pass on their religion to their children was their relationship with their children. The authors found that “parents who interact with their children during their formative years in a warm, affirming and respectful manner are more likely to pass on their religious tradition, beliefs, and practices.” Other things that aid successful transmission include having parents of the same faith who do not divorce and having a strong relationship with grandparents of the same faith.

On the other hand, religious conflict between parents and children was one of the most common routes from religion to atheism. If resistant children were forced into religious activities, they often rebelled as soon as they had the chance.

So, a child with weak cognitive inhibition and a positive relationship with his married parents of the same faith is likely to carry on in the religious family tradition. A child with strong cognitive inhibition who is forced to go to church against his will is likely to rebel.

Was the latter the case with Obal? He shared his parents’ belief as a child, but his parents “bribed” him into going to Oral Roberts University, so there was some religious conflict. As for cognitive inhibition? Well, he did successfully inhibit his religious belief.

When asked what led to his change in beliefs, Obal has a long list of items that led to his disillusionment with religion. He worked at the Oral Roberts University Television station and said this experience led him to see that “this whole world of TV evangelism and [religious network] Trinity Broadcasting was just a scam.” Also, he saw many friends and family blindly support the war in Iraq after 9/11 and began to think they were influenced by propaganda instead of following God. This led him to question Christianity as a whole.

He gave some credit to a certain plant as well.

“I started using marijuana, which opened my mind,” he said. “So my thought process became a bit more critical towards religion and the implausible cornerstones of faith.”

Along with cognitive inhibition and familial transmission, this sounds like something that requires further research.

The attacks on tourists and Easter worshippers in Sri Lanka are an attack on humanity . On a day devoted to love , redemption , and renewal , we pray for the victims and stand with the people of Sri Lanka . — Barack Obama ( @ BarackObama ) April 21 , 2019
But then some right-wingers noticed that other prominent figures on the left , including Hillary Clinton and Julián Castro , had used the phrase Easter worshippers too . Soon , a suspicion arose : “ Easter worshippers ” is a euphemism used by “ people who don ’ t want to say ‘ Christians. ’ ” “ We ’ re actually called Christians not ‘ Easter worshippers ’ wouldn ’ t hurt to maybe just say that , ” a National Review writer tweeted . Obama and friends “ could not bring themselves to identify the victims of the attacks as ‘ Christians , ’ ” Breitbart huffed , deeming the phrase a “ Sympathy Snub. ” An op-ed in the Washington Times called Obama and Clinton “ anti-Christian . ”
Some went further , interpreting the term Easter worshipper as a false claim that Christians worship the holiday of Easter . “ We don ’ t worship Easter , ” Laura Ingraham tweeted . “ We worship Jesus Christ. ” Others , including One America News Network host Jack Posobiec , claimed to have never heard the term Easter worshipper before Sunday .
Before Sunday , to be clear , the term Easter worshipper was considered straightforward enough that the AP used it in a headline about another recent church-based international tragedy : “ Tourists , Easter Worshippers Lament Closure of Notre Dame. ” Nevertheless , let me try to help : “ Easter worshippers ” describes Christians in church on Easter Sunday . The term is more descriptive than “ Christians , ” because it conveys the additional fact that the victims were actively celebrating Easter when they were killed . They are worshippers , and it is Easter . If it helps , try putting the emphasis on worshippers in the phrase : It ’ s Easter worshippers , not Easter-worshippers .

I would argue that it takes a true savant of exquisitely attuned grievance collection to read an individual reference to “ Easter worshippers ” as an attempt to avoid acknowledging Christianity . Easter is the most important holiday in the Christian calendar . “ Easter ” has no other meaning . As a celebration , it is far less secularly degraded than Christmas . Bunnies aside , it is basically inaccessible as a holiday to anyone uncomfortable with acknowledging the story of the resurrection of Jesus Christ . If anything , “ Easter worshippers ” puts extra emphasis on the religious nature of the attack by pointing out that it happened on a day of special spiritual meaning to victims . It implies : Not only did you attack Christians , you did it today of all days .
There are arguments for preferring “ Christians ” to “ Easter worshippers ” in this context . Southern Baptist writer and professor Denny Burk argued that persecuted Christians may prefer the straightforward term Christians because it highlights the faith they are willing to die for . That would be a stronger argument if Obama and other Democrats had used a term like Sri Lankans , without any religious meaning . But again , they did not do that . They used a term that is inextricably associated with Christianity . ( In other contexts , in fact , conservative Christians make the point that not all holiday churchgoers are “ real ” Christians . As early-20th-century evangelist Billy Sunday once put it : “ Going to church doesn ’ t make you a Christian any more than going to a garage makes you an automobile . ” )
By my count , Beto O ’ Rourke is the only major 2020 presidential candidate who used the word Christian in his tweet lamenting the attacks . That includes Trump , who mentioned the “ attack on churches and hotels ” but did not as of yet name the religious group who might have been worshipping in those churches .
Of course , “ Easter worshippers ” was never the real problem . The meat of the outrage is not that Democrats are afraid of the word Christian or that “ Easter worshippers ” is somehow an inaccessibly confusing phrase . The real implication is that Democrats supposedly have an insufficient concern for Christians as a persecuted identity group . This is an old theme : Obama came under attack in 2015 for failing to mention the religion of victims of a terrorist attack in Kenya , for example . He was regularly criticized by the same cohort for failing to use the exact term Islamic terrorism . As Family Research Council president Tony Perkins put it at the time , “ When it comes to persecuted Christians , not only do we not have action , we rarely get words . ”
President Donald Trump has been more willing to offer “ words. ” He has spoken publicly about attacks on Christians in Nigeria , an ongoing issue that the American Christian media follows closely . The first draft of his 2017 “ refugee ban ” carved out exceptions for religious minorities from the Middle East , which he promoted on the Christian Broadcasting Network as a favor to Christians : “ If you were a Muslim you could come in , but if you were a Christian , it was almost impossible . … And I thought it was very , very unfair , ” he said .

Francis’ announcement on Tuesday — outlined in two papal documents and coming after he appointed a special commission on the subject a year ago — was framed as an effort to fix inefficiencies in the annulment procedure and not as an endorsement of divorce.",www.nytimes.com,left,8OeeVopDFMWB2JbE

White Christians are no longer a majority in America, but they still make up nearly three-quarters of the Republican Party, according to a sweeping new study of faith in America being released Wednesday.

White Christians accounted for 80% of the U.S. population when Jimmy Carter was president; that number had dropped to 54% by 2006, and white Christians now make up only 43% of the U.S. population, as the number of people unaffiliated with any religion has swelled.

But the GOP remains about 73% white Christian — down slightly from 10 years ago — and 35% evangelical, despite the fact that white evangelical protestants now make up only 17% of the U.S. population, according to the yearlong survey of more than 100,000 people by PRRI, a public policy research firm that specializes in issues of faith.

By contrast, fewer than one-third of Democrats are white Christians, down from about 50% a decade ago.

“We are seeing this widening gap between the two political parties,” said PRRI CEO Robert P. Jones.

“If you think about some of the big worries the founding fathers had about political parties, it was that they would accentuate factionalism rather than smoothing it over,” Jones said. “I think we are really seeing that. We are seeing increasingly the Republican Party becoming more and more a white Christian party that is heavily rooted in the South and Midwest and the Democratic Party kind of following along these demographic changes, becoming less white and less Christian.”

As race and religion become strong predictors of party affiliation, Jones said, “this looks more and more like a tribal identity than a political affiliation.”

Outside politics, the PRRI survey shows a dramatic shift in the nation’s religious views, with a big increase in the number of people — especially young people — declaring themselves “unaffiliated.” About 24% of Americans are now religiously unaffiliated, up from about 10% in 1995. Among people aged 18-29, that number rises to just shy of 40%.

The PRRI survey found 20 states where the “unaffiliated” make up a larger percentage population than other single faith group, including Democratic strongholds like Vermont, Oregon and Washington along with traditional “red” states like Montana, Idaho and Wyoming.

But these unaffiliated Americans are not much of a political force. PRRI reported in September that the unaffiliated make up only about 12% of the vote in any national election. And the Pew Research Center on Religion and Public Life reported in January that the 115th Congress is a little over 90% Christian, a number that has remained largely unchanged for decades.

John Green, director of the Bliss Center of Applied Politics at the University of Akron, said the numbers in the PRRI survey largely reaffirm long-developing trends in American politics, but that does not mean they are without concern for both parties.

""There are real costs for political parties becoming too closely identified with one religious group or cultural group,"" Green said. Some Republicans voiced concern in the 1980s, as the party began to emphasize a strong faith-based agenda, that it would be at risk of alienating moderates and non-religious people.

By the same token, he said, ""there are Democratic leaders today worried about becoming a non-religious party or an anti-white-Christian party.""

But Green noted that ethic identity has always been a significant component of American political parties, and ""a kind of tribal pattern is not a new thing at all.""

Neither the Republican nor the Democratic Party seemed interested in discussing the faith of their members.

religion_and_faith,Guest Writer,1,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/22/why-pope-francis-matters-even-if-youre-not-catholic.html,OPINION: Why Pope Francis matters (even if you're not Catholic),2015-09-22,Michael Guillen,"As an evangelical Christian , I can see at least three reasons why Pope Francis and his six-day visit to our nation should matter to all Americans , not just Catholics .
First , the pope matters because he represents half of the world ’ s 2.18 billion Christians . And he reminds us that no other religion comes close to matching Christianity ’ s vast geographical , cultural and racial diversity . According to the Pew Research Center : “ Christians are … so far-flung , in fact , that no single continent or region can indisputably claim to be the center of global Christianity. ” For that reason , no Grand Mufti or Grand Ayatollah , no Chief Rabbi , no Dalai Lama , can hope to travel the four corners of the world and elicit the kind of superstar-like greeting that is accorded to a Pope Francis or a Billy Graham .
Second , Francis matters because he reminds us that the pope is not only a head of state – Vatican City is the smallest independent nation in the world but also one of the most influential – he is also meant to be a pastor . And no other pontiff in my lifetime has shepherded his planet-wide flock as humbly , tenderly , or cheerily as Francis .
Pope Francis reminds everyone that we Americans aren ’ t the center of the universe – gasp ! – but that we are a nation mightily blessed by a God who values a humble spirit and a hospitable heart .
Third , Pope Francis matters because he reminds us of how terribly divided we ’ ve become not only in the United States , but globally . Francis himself leans left in his severe upbraiding of wanton capitalism and his belief in manmade climate change . And he leans right in his unshakeable opposition to abortion and his defense of the Biblical definition of marriage , which is the consecrated union of a man and a woman . Yet he holds the two opposing views so sincerely and thoughtfully , and is so likeable in the process , that he makes it hard for the rest of us to go on demonizing our political opponents .
In his day , Jesus was a study in sharp contrasts . In his zealous concern for the poor , he behaved like a true man of the people . But in his seeming inattention to the atrocities being committed by the Roman Empire , which in Jesus ’ time was at the height of its awful power , he came across as indifferent to the political plight of his fellow Jews .
The Bible reports that Jesus enjoyed a three-year honeymoon , during which he played to enlarging , adoring crowds of poor and oppressed Jews . They cheered him on , followed him everywhere , as he performed miracles and called out the Temple leadership for their arrogance and hypocrisies .
But then they all turned on him – the people , the Temple priesthood , the Roman government – and he ended up being crucified . He was a sinless man who preached love and forgiveness , but everyone turned on him when they discovered he was not everything they wanted him to be .
Pope Francis is now smack in the middle of the third year of his papacy ’ s honeymoon period . He is hugely popular because he comes across as a man of the people , an unpretentious servant of God who clearly loves the down-and-out exceedingly more than he does the stuffy , pompous trappings of his office . It ’ s no wonder President Obama is going to meet him at the airport immediately upon his arrival – who wouldn ’ t want Francis on his team ?
But what will happen to Francis ’ s popularity if he uses his visit to the Democrat-controlled White House tomorrow to reiterate – albeit lovingly – his hardline stand against abortion and gay marriage ? President Obama has reportedly invited to the reception a handful of LGBT activists antagonistic to the Catholic church . And what will happen to the pope ’ s soaring popularity if he uses his visit to the Republican-controlled Congress on Thursday to sound off about manmade climate change ? Many conservative members of the House and Senate fervently cite scientific evidence that climate change is mostly natural .
In short , how popular will this Jesus-like Francis be when liberals and conservatives are reminded that he is not everything they want him to be ?
Having said that , I believe that even if the pope ’ s popularity takes a hit after this revealing , first-ever , up-close-and-personal time with us here in the United States , the richest nation in the world , it ’ s fairly certain he will continue being enormously well-liked globally , where poverty is the norm .
That ’ s the final , important reason why Pope Francis should matter to us . He reminds everyone that we Americans aren ’ t the center of the universe – gasp ! – but that we are a nation mightily blessed by a God who values a humble spirit and a hospitable heart . Heavenly qualities that I expect and pray will be greatly in evidence during the next six exciting days .","As an evangelical Christian, I can see at least three reasons why Pope Francis and his six-day visit to our nation should matter to all Americans, not just Catholics.

Yet he holds the two opposing views so sincerely and thoughtfully, and is so likeable in the process, that he makes it hard for the rest of us to go on demonizing our political opponents.

Still, he is vulnerable. Like Jesus.

In his day, Jesus was a study in sharp contrasts. In his zealous concern for the poor, he behaved like a true man of the people. But in his seeming inattention to the atrocities being committed by the Roman Empire, which in Jesus’ time was at the height of its awful power, he came across as indifferent to the political plight of his fellow Jews.

Pope Francis is now smack in the middle of the third year of his papacy’s honeymoon period.

“ Whether they ’ re right in worrying about that or not , only time will tell , ” continues Professor Muñoz . “ But certainly that ’ s a fear social conservatives have . ”
“ Traditional religious believers certainly feel under attack , ” says Vincent Phillip Muñoz . “ I mean , there ’ s been a huge cultural shift over the last handful of years , an increasing acceptance of LGBT rights , and for many traditional religious believers , they worry that their beliefs are no longer welcome , or even will no longer be tolerated . ”
In three end-of-term decisions , the U.S. Supreme Court has elevated religious liberty – which was taken up in legislation in the 1990s to offer protections to Native American religions – and weighted the rights of Christians above those of women and LGBTQ Americans . The rulings come amid a rapidly changing U.S. society , where a majority of Americans believe in equal rights for LGBTQ Americans and fewer Americans identify as religious .
Last week , in one of the Supreme Court ’ s major rulings about the meaning of religious freedom and the separation of church and state , Justice Samuel Alito wrote a passionate account of the ugly anti-Catholic animus that once animated the country ’ s education policies .
At issue in the first of three end-of-term rulings – each hailed by religious conservatives as an important victory for the cause of religious liberty , and decried by critics as allowing religious Americans to infringe on the rights of others – was the state of Montana ’ s no-aid provision , or so-called Blaine amendment . Such provisions , long enshrined in 37 state constitutions , restrict public funding from religious establishments and , proponents say , maintain a careful “ wall of separation ” between church and state .
In Espinoza v. Montana , Justice Alito described how the nation ’ s Blaine amendments were rooted in 19th- and 20th-century Protestant bigotry and a central part of efforts to stave off “ sectarian ” Catholic schools and their foreign ideas and ways of worship .
The court ’ s majority said the state ’ s no-aid provision violated the First Amendment ’ s free exercise clause when it excluded religious schools and families from a tax-credit scholarship program . “ They are members of the community too , ” the court said in the 5-4 decision in Espinoza . “ Their exclusion from the scholarship program here is odious to our Constitution and can not stand . ”
Taken together , all three decisions continue the Supreme Court ’ s prioritization of religious liberty as it expands this protected and unique sphere in American social life . On the one hand , the decisions of the current court could be seen as chipping away at the wall of separation – an extra-textual First Amendment metaphor that often makes religious conservatives bristle .
But at the same time , the decisions this term and over the past few years have been refortifying the wall of separation , bolstering its height and thickness even as it expands religious establishments ’ many exemptions from the country ’ s social and legal norms otherwise . As a result , the court ’ s left-leaning critics say , many women and LGBTQ Americans have found their own freedoms especially curtailed .
All three decisions , too , come amid a rapidly changing U.S. society in which fewer Americans identify as religious and where a majority of Americans have welcomed married same-sex couples and others into the country ’ s traditional norms and affirmed their equal rights – a seismic shift few thought possible even a decade ago , experts say .
As a result , “ traditional religious believers certainly feel under attack , ” says Vincent Phillip Muñoz , professor of religion and public life at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana . “ I mean , there ’ s been a huge cultural shift over the last handful of years , an increasing acceptance of LGBT rights , and for many traditional religious believers , they worry that their beliefs are no longer welcome , or even will no longer be tolerated . ”
“ Whether they ’ re right in worrying about that or not , only time will tell , ” continues Professor Muñoz , whose work was cited by both Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Clarence Thomas in their opinions in Espinoza . “ But certainly that ’ s a fear social conservatives have . ”
For some liberal-leaning scholars , such fear , rooted in a sense of cultural vulnerability expressed by other minority groups , risks becoming reactionary . Like Justice Alito ’ s passionate account of what might be called WASP supremacy or a Protestant bigotry toward foreign religious “ others , ” religious conservatives have in many ways begun to see themselves as a despised and ridiculed class .
“ In their eagerness to assume the mantle of oppression for Catholics and other Christians in the U.S. , Justice Alito and other conservatives seem to want to join the current cultural zeitgeist , or this particular cultural moment when we are trying to figure out how to respond to centuries of oppression , ” says Jessie Hill , professor at the School of Law at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland , noting similar recent descriptions of the Tulsa race massacre of 1921 .
“ But it ’ s really not exactly the same thing in a lot of ways , ” she continues . “ One of which , and the most obvious is , Catholics have tremendous political and cultural power right now . ”
It was not always the case . In his concurring opinion Justice Alito , who , like four others on the nation ’ s high court , is Roman Catholic , expressed an implicit sense of grievance and vulnerability .
At the outset , the conservative justice admitted that such historical appeals are not normally part of his interpretive toolbox . In a previous case this year that recounted the ugly history of racism in the jury rules of Oregon and Louisiana , he noted he had dissented , arguing that only the texts of these laws , and not their historical contexts , should constitute the court ’ s primary focus .
“ But I lost , and [ the case ] is now precedent , ” he wrote . “ If the original motivation for the laws mattered there , it certainly matters here . ”
Including a picture of a famous cartoon from 1871 that “ depicts Catholic priests as crocodiles slithering hungrily toward American children as a public school crumbles in the background , ” Justice Alito described how religious bigotry not only infused the nation ’ s elites , but also erupted in episodes of violence and murder .
“ In Massachusetts and elsewhere , Catholic students were beaten and expelled for refusing to read from the King James Bible , ” Justice Alito wrote . “ In New York , a mob destroyed the residence of Bishop John Hughes , who had argued that , if the State was going to fund religious public education , it should also support church schools . ”
Most notorious were the Philadelphia Bible riots in 1844 : “ Months of scaremongering broke out into riots that left two of the city ’ s Catholic churches burned and several people dead , ” he continued . Among the proponents of Blaine amendments , he also noted , was the Ku Klux Klan .
Even before the Supreme Court ’ s landmark Obergefell decision in 2015 , which legalized same-sex marriage in all 50 states , the rapid pace of social change led many religious conservatives to emphasize their influence in the federal judiciary . They sought out legal pathways to opt out of the ritual aspects of same-sex weddings in the public sphere , even while seeking more room to freely exercise their deeply held religious convictions unencumbered by certain civil rights protections for sexual minorities and women .
“ While these rulings will certainly disappoint those who want a stronger wall of separation between church and state , these conservative Supreme Court outcomes are exactly why evangelicals so strongly support President Trump , ” says Mark Miller , director of the law and society program at Clark University in Worcester , Massachusetts . “ Their top priority is getting conservative judges on the courts who will read these constitutional clauses in ways that the religious right favors . ”
In the final week of the Supreme Court ’ s current term , such priorities have appeared to pay off . In the first of two opinions issued Wednesday , the court continued to reshape its religious freedom jurisprudence , expanding a doctrine known as the “ ministerial exception ” and bolstering religious institutions ’ exemptions from general employment discrimination laws .
Courts should not be able to intervene in a religious institution ’ s employment disputes , the justices ruled in Our Lady of Guadalupe School v. Morrissey-Berru . Nor , more significantly , should courts question whom religious institutions deem “ ministerial ” and thus exempt from employment discrimination protections .
In a dissent , Justice Sonia Sotomayor , who is also Catholic , joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , contrasted this ruling with the Espinoza decision last week , and focused on the vulnerabilities of women , LGTBQ people , and others affected by expanding exemptions for the nation ’ s religious groups .
“ Recently , this court has lamented a perceived ‘ discrimination against religion , ’ ” she wrote . “ Yet here it swings the pendulum in the extreme opposite direction , permitting religious entities to discriminate widely and with impunity for reasons wholly divorced from religious beliefs . ”
“ The inherent injustice in the court ’ s conclusion will be impossible to ignore for long , particularly in a pluralistic society like ours , ” she added .
Wednesday ’ s second ruling , a 7-2 decision holding that businesses and other entities can claim religious and moral exemptions from the Affordable Care Act ’ s contraceptive mandate , follows a similar theme , according to some justices .
There were no constitutional issues at question in the case , Little Sisters of the Poor v. Pennsylvania , and the majority held that the Trump administration ’ s expanded exemptions were lawful . In a dissent , however , Justice Ginsburg , joined by Justice Sotomayor , accused the court of departing from its long-held “ balanced approach ” to ensuring that “ the religious beliefs of some [ don ’ t ] overwhelm the rights and interests of others who do not share those beliefs . ”
“ Today , for the first time , the Court casts totally aside countervailing rights and interests in its zeal to secure religious rights to the nth degree , ” she added .
But Professor Muñoz points out that the Supreme Court also issued a groundbreaking and far-reaching victory for LGBTQ rights this June when it redefined “ sex ” and thus greatly expanded civil rights protections to include sexual minorities in the workplace .
“ It ’ s hard for people to remember that , originally , the idea of religious exemptions and , you know , carving out a robust sphere of protection for religious individuals and institutions , that was liberal jurisprudence 50 years ago , ” he says , noting that state and federal “ religious freedom restoration acts ” began as efforts to shield the religious rituals of Native peoples from certain generally applicable drug laws .
“ In a way , this has been the year of nondiscrimination – nondiscrimination for progressive groups as well as religious groups , ” continues Professor Muñoz . “ And it ’ s not so obvious that this is against the wall of separation . ”","Some liberal-leaning scholars question whether the legacies of religious bigotry are necessarily similar to those surrounding racism and white supremacy. “It’s really not exactly the same thing in a lot of ways,” says Professor Jessie Hill. “One of which, and the most obvious is, Catholics have tremendous political and cultural power right now.”

“Whether they’re right in worrying about that or not, only time will tell,” continues Professor Muñoz. “But certainly that’s a fear social conservatives have.”

“Traditional religious believers certainly feel under attack,” says Vincent Phillip Muñoz. “I mean, there’s been a huge cultural shift over the last handful of years, an increasing acceptance of LGBT rights, and for many traditional religious believers, they worry that their beliefs are no longer welcome, or even will no longer be tolerated.”

It was not always the case. In his concurring opinion Justice Alito, who, like four others on the nation’s high court, is Roman Catholic, expressed an implicit sense of grievance and vulnerability.

Including a picture of a famous cartoon from 1871 that “depicts Catholic priests as crocodiles slithering hungrily toward American children as a public school crumbles in the background,” Justice Alito described how religious bigotry not only infused the nation’s elites, but also erupted in episodes of violence and murder.

“In Massachusetts and elsewhere, Catholic students were beaten and expelled for refusing to read from the King James Bible,” Justice Alito wrote. “In New York, a mob destroyed the residence of Bishop John Hughes, who had argued that, if the State was going to fund religious public education, it should also support church schools.”

Most notorious were the Philadelphia Bible riots in 1844: “Months of scaremongering broke out into riots that left two of the city’s Catholic churches burned and several people dead,” he continued. Among the proponents of Blaine amendments, he also noted, was the Ku Klux Klan.

Changing U.S. society

Even before the Supreme Court’s landmark Obergefell decision in 2015, which legalized same-sex marriage in all 50 states, the rapid pace of social change led many religious conservatives to emphasize their influence in the federal judiciary. They sought out legal pathways to opt out of the ritual aspects of same-sex weddings in the public sphere, even while seeking more room to freely exercise their deeply held religious convictions unencumbered by certain civil rights protections for sexual minorities and women.

“While these rulings will certainly disappoint those who want a stronger wall of separation between church and state, these conservative Supreme Court outcomes are exactly why evangelicals so strongly support President Trump,” says Mark Miller, director of the law and society program at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts. “Their top priority is getting conservative judges on the courts who will read these constitutional clauses in ways that the religious right favors.”

In the final week of the Supreme Court’s current term, such priorities have appeared to pay off. In the first of two opinions issued Wednesday, the court continued to reshape its religious freedom jurisprudence, expanding a doctrine known as the “ministerial exception” and bolstering religious institutions’ exemptions from general employment discrimination laws.

Courts should not be able to intervene in a religious institution’s employment disputes, the justices ruled in Our Lady of Guadalupe School v. Morrissey-Berru. Nor, more significantly, should courts question whom religious institutions deem “ministerial” and thus exempt from employment discrimination protections.

In a dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who is also Catholic, joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, contrasted this ruling with the Espinoza decision last week, and focused on the vulnerabilities of women, LGTBQ people, and others affected by expanding exemptions for the nation’s religious groups.

“Recently, this court has lamented a perceived ‘discrimination against religion,’” she wrote. “Yet here it swings the pendulum in the extreme opposite direction, permitting religious entities to discriminate widely and with impunity for reasons wholly divorced from religious beliefs.”

“The inherent injustice in the court’s conclusion will be impossible to ignore for long, particularly in a pluralistic society like ours,” she added.

End of the “balanced approach”?

Wednesday’s second ruling, a 7-2 decision holding that businesses and other entities can claim religious and moral exemptions from the Affordable Care Act’s contraceptive mandate, follows a similar theme, according to some justices.

There were no constitutional issues at question in the case, Little Sisters of the Poor v. Pennsylvania, and the majority held that the Trump administration’s expanded exemptions were lawful. In a dissent, however, Justice Ginsburg, joined by Justice Sotomayor, accused the court of departing from its long-held “balanced approach” to ensuring that “the religious beliefs of some [don’t] overwhelm the rights and interests of others who do not share those beliefs.”

“Today, for the first time, the Court casts totally aside countervailing rights and interests in its zeal to secure religious rights to the nth degree,” she added.

But Professor Muñoz points out that the Supreme Court also issued a groundbreaking and far-reaching victory for LGBTQ rights this June when it redefined “sex” and thus greatly expanded civil rights protections to include sexual minorities in the workplace.

“It’s hard for people to remember that, originally, the idea of religious exemptions and, you know, carving out a robust sphere of protection for religious individuals and institutions, that was liberal jurisprudence 50 years ago,” he says, noting that state and federal “religious freedom restoration acts” began as efforts to shield the religious rituals of Native peoples from certain generally applicable drug laws.

“In a way, this has been the year of nondiscrimination – nondiscrimination for progressive groups as well as religious groups,” continues Professor Muñoz. “And it’s not so obvious that this is against the wall of separation.”",www.csmonitor.com,center,sbrSNZ0MM3TIEMSf

Trump Stands Up for Religious Freedom

On the religious freedom front, the president defended the importance of faith-based adoption agencies which have been under attack from the Left lately.

These agencies are being discriminated against because of their biblical beliefs about marriage and sexuality.

""We will always protect our country's long and proud tradition of faith-based adoption. My administration is working to ensure that faith-based adoption agencies are able to help vulnerable children find their forever families, while following their deeply held beliefs,"" Trump said.

To my mind , that outrage — if we can call it an outrage — was overblown .
But “ Easter worshippers ” is a different thing entirely . Responding to the slaughter of hundreds of Christians during Easter attacks by radical Islamic terrorists , a number of prominent Democratic politicians chose to issue statements that glaringly omit any direct mention of the faith identity of the victims .
Barack Obama said this : “ The attacks on tourists and Easter worshippers in Sri Lanka are an attack on humanity . On a day devoted to love , redemption , and renewal , we pray for the victims and stand with the people of Sri Lanka . ”
Hillary Clinton seemed to be working literally from the same script : “ On this holy weekend for many faiths , we must stand united against hatred and violence . I ’ m praying for everyone affected by today ’ s horrific attacks on Easter worshippers and travelers in Sri Lanka . ”

I have been a Christian all my life and if I ’ ve ever heard the term “ Easter worshipper , ” or something like it , it would have been in reference to Christians who only go to church on Christmas and Easter .

Unless , of course , there is some reason why they don ’ t want to explicitly acknowledge the group in question . And that appears to be the case here .
As it happens , we don ’ t need to wonder how the likes of Clinton and Obama would respond to a similar attack against Muslims . There was just such an attack a few weeks ago in New Zealand . Let ’ s look at their statements .
Obama : “ Michelle and I send our condolences to the people of New Zealand . We grieve with you and the Muslim community . All of us must stand against hatred in all its forms . ”
Clinton : “ My heart breaks for New Zealand & the global Muslim community . We must continue to fight the perpetuation and normalization of Islamophobia and racism in all its forms . White supremacist terrorists must be condemned by leaders everywhere . Their murderous hatred must be stopped . ”
This gives the game away . No rational person could fail to notice a stark contrast between these statements and the ones issued in response to nearly 300 butchered Christians on Easter Sunday . They both make sure to use the word “ Muslim. ” Clinton goes further and ropes in “ Islamophobia ” and “ [ w ] hite supremacist terrorists. ” Not only does she omit “ Christian ” from her comments on Sri Lanka , but she certainly says nothing about “ Christophobia ” and “ Islamic terrorists . ”
Are we supposed to believe that this is a mere coincidence ? If so , is it also a coincidence that Hillary Clinton , who accidentally forgot the word “ Christian ” yesterday on Easter , did not forget the phrase “ LGBT community ” after the shooting at a gay club in Orlando three years ago ?

This dichotomy would be thrown wildly out of balance and sent into disarray if Christians were admitted into the victim column — especially because they are so often victimized by Muslim extremists .
No , the Democrats can ’ t have that . So they usually ignore the genocide of Christians , and often enact policies that make it worse . And when they are forced , on the rare occasion , to acknowledge an attack of this sort , they will do it without saying anything that might give ignorant Americans the impression that there is a real systematic problem of Christians being constantly blown up and murdered by Muslim extremists .

One requester demanded that Jack Phillips bake a cake for Satan , complete with a working sex toy .
Another request involved a cake that was blue on the outside and pink on the inside — which wasn ’ t a problem until the caller said it was meant to commemorate her transition from male to female .
Just weeks after the Supreme Court ruled that Colorado bungled its case against Mr. Phillips over the same-sex wedding cake and found the state showed “ hostility ” to his religious beliefs , the state ’ s Civil Rights Commission slapped him with a judgment over the transgender cake .
He said the state crossed the line into harassment and sued Tuesday in federal court , asking a judge to order it to leave him alone .
“ For over six years now , Colorado has been on a crusade to crush plaintiff Jack Phillips … because its officials despise what he believes and how he practices his faith , ” his attorneys say in the lawsuit .
Mr. Phillips and Masterpiece Cakeshop have been at the spear ’ s tip of the clash between gay rights advocates and devout business owners , who say their beliefs are trampled when they are forced to provide services for messages that they find offensive .
Mr. Phillips has plowed new ground with his argument that his cakes are art and that requiring him to bake cakes conveying messages he disagrees with interferes with his religious beliefs and his First Amendment free speech rights .
Colorado and other states say that is not a good enough reason to violate their public accommodation laws , which prohibit businesses from refusing service to anyone based on religion , race , sexual orientation or national origin .
The justices in June found that the state does have the power to protect gay residents ’ access to services , but they also ruled that the Civil Rights Commission showed striking hostility toward Mr. Phillips ‘ religious beliefs that tainted the panel ’ s ruling . They ordered the commission to conduct a do-over , with instructions to give Mr. Phillips ‘ deeply held beliefs more respect .
Since his case reached the high court , Mr. Phillips said , he has faced “ venomous ” harassment including death threats and “ countless hateful phone calls. ” He also lost 40 percent of his income and had to cut more than half of his workforce .
He said a Colorado lawyer , August Scardina , has made a crusade out of pestering him with outrageous cake requests and then complaining to state officials when he refuses .
On the day the Supreme Court accepted his case , he said , Ms. Scardina called to ask for the blue and pink transgender cake .
She called back later that year , he says in his lawsuit , asking for a “ birthday ” cake for Satan , showing the prince of darkness smoking marijuana .
On the June day when the Supreme Court ruled on the same-sex wedding cake case , someone claiming to be from the Church of Satan emailed a request for a three-tiered cake with “ a large figure of Satan , licking a 9-inch black Dildo . ”
“ I would like the dildo to be an actual working model , that can be turned on before we unveil the cake , ” the request read .
A few weeks later , Mr. Phillips said , he believes Ms. Scardina visited his shop and asked for a cake with a pentagram — which he said he refused because of its association with witchcraft .
Mr. Phillips said he would be willing to bake a cake for Ms. Scardina with a message that is not objectionable to him and would sell her any of the pre-made cakes in his shop . But forcing him to make a cake with a message he disagrees with goes too far , he said .
Ms. Scardina didn ’ t respond to a request for comment , but , she said in her complaint last year that the store had no problem baking the blue and pink cake until it became clear that it was meant to celebrate the transition from male to female .
The Civil Rights Commission concluded that the shop ’ s refusal wasn ’ t about the message but rather his disapproval of the customer and that it violated her rights as part of two protected classes : her sex and her gender identity .
The commission , which declined a request for comment , cited in its June ruling the Supreme Court ’ s decision and pointed to the justices ’ affirmation that Colorado can protect gay people ’ s access to services .
Mr. Phillips ‘ complaint says the commission is singling him out . He points to commissioners ’ decision not to cite other bakeries that refused to make cakes for a Christian man who wanted them to contain messages opposing same-sex marriage .
Sen. Ben Sasse , Nebraska Republican , said Colorado is headed down a troubling path .
“ A state powerful enough to tell bakers what to bake is powerful enough to tell journalists what stories to write . This is not healthy for the country , ” he said .
Kristen Waggoner , a lawyer for the religious liberty law firm Alliance Defending Freedom , which is representing Mr. Phillips , said there is little question that the state has it in for Mr. Phillips .
“ You have to capture what he has been through to understand the way that Colorado has set out to ruin his life and his vocation , ” she said .
But Jennifer Pizer , policy director at Lambda Legal , a pro-LGBTQ organization , said by representing people such as Mr. Phillips , Alliance Defending Freedom is promoting a “ religious license to discriminate . ”
“ Given the already harsh conditions for many LGBT people , and for transgender Americans in particular , ADF ’ s dedication to discrimination should be recognized as profoundly problematic and inconsistent with essential civil rights norms , ” Ms. Pizer said .
While the high court sent Mr. Phillips ‘ case back to Colorado , as well as a case involving a florist in Washington who declined to work on a same-sex wedding , other cases are winding their way through the courts .
Robert Tuttle , a law professor at George Washington University , said one of those cases will end up at the Supreme Court , forcing the justices to settle the free-speech versus gay rights clash , which they ducked in their June ruling .
“ It doesn ’ t tell you what happens if an administrative process [ without ] that sort of overt bias still decides the cake shop is liable , and my guess is that ’ s what is going to happen in Washington state , ” Mr. Tuttle said .","The Christian baker who fought in the Supreme Court to preserve his right to refuse to make cakes for same-sex weddings says he is now the target of harassment by Colorado and some of its more mischievous residents, who have made a crusade out of trying to force him to bake cakes offensive to him.

In 1992 , during an interview with ███ 's Pat Robertson , he said faith is crucial for anyone leading the country .
`` I do n't believe that an atheist could be president of the United States , '' he said . `` Anybody that did not have something bigger than himself or herself -- and faith is the answer . ''
Bush spoke about regular prayers at meals and before bed with his wife Barbara . He also agreed with Robertson about the need for it in the Oval Office .
Robertson noted that Abraham Lincoln once said he could n't handle the job except on his knees and Bush responded , `` Yes , you have to . ''
He explained , `` The more I am there the more I understood what Lincoln meant , the more I understood the need to have some lift , some strength greater than yourself . ''
Bush spoke of turning to prayer especially in 1990 before he ordered the start of Operation Desert Shield in response to Iraq 's invasion of Kuwait . That operation required a dramatic increase in US troops sent to the Persian Gulf .
`` I especially found that at the time I had to make this -- now it looks easy -- but a crucial decision to commit someone else 's sons and daughters into combat , '' he told Robertson . `` The decision rests only with the president for that -- only the president -- and there was certainly time and need for prayer on that . ''
In 2007 , he spoke about his spirituality during a dedication ceremony for the Billy Graham Library in Charlotte , North Carolina .
`` I 've always viewed my faith as a personal matter , an intensely personal matter and that 's just the way I 'm wired , '' he said . `` There 's nothing self-conscious , however , about my relationship with Jesus Christ and thanks to Billy I have come to understand this all important relationship in deeper and more meaningful ways . ''
Bush 's casket will rest in the Capitol rotunda all day Tuesday for the public to pay its respects .
A presidential aircraft designated as `` Special Air Mission 41 '' flew his casket to the nation 's capital on Monday . Bush 's eldest son , President George W. Bush , and other family members flew on the flight .
On Wednesday at 11 a.m. , President Trump and the first lady will attend an invitation-only state funeral for Bush at the National Cathedral .
Afterwards , the casket will be flown back to Houston for a service at St. Martin 's Episcopal Church on Thursday , followed by a private ceremony and burial at the Bush presidential library on the campus of Texas A & M University in College Station .
He will be buried alongside his wife Barbara , who died in April , and their daughter Robin Bush , who died of leukemia in 1953 at age 3 .","The 41st president of the United States was not one to regularly talk about his faith, but he understood its importance, especially in the Oval Office.

He explained, ""The more I am there the more I understood what Lincoln meant, the more I understood the need to have some lift, some strength greater than yourself.""

Bush spoke of turning to prayer especially in 1990 before he ordered the start of Operation Desert Shield in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. That operation required a dramatic increase in US troops sent to the Persian Gulf.

""I especially found that at the time I had to make this--now it looks easy--but a crucial decision to commit someone else's sons and daughters into combat,"" he told Robertson. ""The decision rests only with the president for that--only the president--and there was certainly time and need for prayer on that.""

In 2007, he spoke about his spirituality during a dedication ceremony for the Billy Graham Library in Charlotte, North Carolina.

""I've always viewed my faith as a personal matter, an intensely personal matter and that's just the way I'm wired,"" he said. ""There's nothing self-conscious, however, about my relationship with Jesus Christ and thanks to Billy I have come to understand this all important relationship in deeper and more meaningful ways.""

Bush's casket will rest in the Capitol rotunda all day Tuesday for the public to pay its respects.

Bush died Friday in Houston at age 94.

A presidential aircraft designated as ""Special Air Mission 41"" flew his casket to the nation's capital on Monday. Bush's eldest son, President George W. Bush, and other family members flew on the flight.

On Wednesday at 11 a.m., President Trump and the first lady will attend an invitation-only state funeral for Bush at the National Cathedral.

Afterwards, the casket will be flown back to Houston for a service at St. Martin's Episcopal Church on Thursday, followed by a private ceremony and burial at the Bush presidential library on the campus of Texas A&M University in College Station.

He will be buried alongside his wife Barbara, who died in April, and their daughter Robin Bush, who died of leukemia in 1953 at age 3.",www1.cbn.com,right,1XetWjMMUaOSxYTx

So what does this mean for transgender Catholics? Here, five trans Catholics respond.

Thomas: Gender isn’t about choice

[Name changed to protect identity.]

There is no evidence in this document that its authors have spent any time listening to transgender or intersex people.

“Gender identity” is not about choosing which gender you would rather be, but noticing which gender you already are, as a gift given to you by God. For most transgender people, transgenderism can be more accurately defined as “experiencing as given a gender different from the gender associated with your sex as identified at birth.”

It’s disappointing that they’re writing out of ignorance about the actual lived experiences and thoughts of trans and intersex folks, but it was a gentler and less condemnatory document than others I’ve read. Their advice about listening was good; they just have to take it.

Cameron: I can’t read this

I’ve decided not to read it because I know it is not going to change my mind about how I live my life. I’ve been a better place emotionally recently, and know that reading it would only upset me.

Colleen: They can’t take the church away from me

In approaching the matter of sexuality and gender, the authors have failed to cite any but church documents. There is no reference made to the scientific advances made in the last half-century regarding the whole realm of human sexuality. It is not sufficient to suggest, as these authors do, that males have XY chromosomes and females have XX chromosomes.

All in all, this is a rear-guard attempt to defend a hyper-conservative Catholic view that, especially in light of the sex abuse/church cover-up scandal, seems almost laughable were it not so tragic.

Does this all leave me in doctrinal limbo? Well, it certainly sends a signal that some folk in the higher echelons of the church are trying to turn back the clock. However, if you’ll forgive me bowdlerizing Ira Gershwin’s fabulous lyric, when it comes to the church, “they can’t take that away from me.”

Scotty: I can’t do this anymore

I couldn’t read the entire thing. Frankly, I got irritated at the beginning with [their focus on] gender theory. There is actual science and medical knowledge that the church is choosing to ignore. It’s not theory.

I’m irritated that once again the church has chosen to diminish and limits my lived experience while saying that they are listening. They’re not.

Lately, every time I start to soften a little bit and think about maybe going back to church, something awful like this happens. ... I’m sick of being abused by those who are supposed to be my family. I can’t make room in my life for that anymore.

Hilary: I’m ready for dialogue

There will be a few transgender Catholics who will take them at their word and use the title to promote a dialogue. If they want to have one, I am ready. But there will be many more who will finally concede that the church is just too irrelevant to life in the 21st century and will find other spiritual homes.

Then there are those who will be attacked and marginalized by people who will find justification for their prejudice in this paper. All of that is heartbreaking.

Pope Francis once said that Christians must have “ cheerful faces and eyes full of joy ” . But there was little evidence of those emotions as Donald Trump descended on the Vatican on Wednesday for his first face-to-face meeting with the Argentinian pontiff .
The encounter was ultimately considered a success following a rocky start to the pair ’ s relationship last year , when Francis questioned Trump ’ s Christian credentials . But despite a warm trading of gifts and humorous exchange between Pope Francis and the first lady , Melania Trump – in which the pope asked if she fed him a popular kind of Slovenian cake – the meeting was noteworthy for its sombre tone at the start .
Play Video 0:14 Pope Francis asks Melania Trump : 'What do you feed him ? ' – video
Greeting the US president in the papal library , Francis did not exude his usual warmth and cheerfulness even as Trump proclaimed that it was a “ great honour ” to meet him .
Photographs taken after their meeting showed a glum-looking pope , in contrast to the smiles when Francis met Trump ’ s predecessor , Barack Obama , who reportedly used to carry a rosary with him that was given to him by the pontiff .
The tensions were perhaps to be expected : the two disagree on the issues that lie closest to Francis ’ s heart , from climate change to the need to integrate and accept migrants of all faiths .
As they sat down opposite one another at a large wooden desk , Francis signalled to the president that it was best to talk out of the earshot of reporters and cameras , who were quickly led out of the papal library . The two then had a 29-minute chat with only the interpreter present , not quite as long as the nearly hour-long conversation the pope had with Obama when they met in 2014 .
“ Obviously there was no evidence of the great chemistry he had with Obama . There was something special there with him , ” said Austen Ivereigh , the pope ’ s biographer .
“ I think it was a solemn occasion that called for formality and protocol and both demonstrated that … they looked much more relaxed at the end , ” he added .
The discussion was described as cordial in a statement by the Holy See , which said “ satisfaction was expressed ” for the good US relationship with the Vatican and their “ joint commitment in favour of life , and freedom of worship and conscience ” .
“ It is hoped that there may be serene collaboration between the state and the Catholic church in the United States , engaged in service to the people in the fields of healthcare , education and assistance to immigrants , ” the statement said .
Left unsaid was the fact that the Trump administration ’ s policies on migrants have been condemned by Francis ’ s allies in the US , including Joe Tobin , the archbishop of Newark , New Jersey .
They also discussed world affairs , including interfaith dialogue and peace in the Middle East , with emphasis on the protection of Christians .
Rex Tillerson , the US secretary of state who accompanied the president , later confirmed that Trump and Francis had a “ pretty extensive ” conversation about terrorist threats and the radicalisation of young people .
By the end of the half-hour private meeting , once the door to the library was reopened , Francis seemed more chipper . Upon meeting the first lady , he asked her whether she fed her husband potica , the pope ’ s favourite Slovenian dessert . An interpreter then asked Melania : “ What do you give him to eat ? ” . It was unclear whether the first lady understood the remark , and seemed to say , “ pizza ? ” before smiling and answering , “ yes ” .
The US president was also accompanied by his daughter Ivanka , her husband , Jared Kushner , national security adviser HR McMaster , and personal assistant Keith Schiller , as well as press aides .
Trump arrived at the Vatican at about 8.30am after spending the night at the residence of the US ambassador to Italy . That post has not yet been filled by Trump ’ s administration .
Trump was led into the frescoed halls of the Vatican with Melania – dressed in a traditional black dress and veil , as is custom but not mandatory – walking a few feet behind him .
“ It ’ s not like Trump Tower in New York , ” a German archbishop , Georg Gänswein , could be overheard joking to Trump as the president ’ s entourage shuffled into a Vatican elevator .
As is customary , the two exchanged gifts . Trump offered the pope a large box that he said was filled with books written by Martin Luther King .
“ This is a gift for you , ” Trump was overheard saying . “ I think you will enjoy them . I hope you do . ”
Francis gave Trump a large medallion that depicted an olive branch , a symbol of peace , to which the president replied : “ We can use peace. ” The medallion is traditionally offered to politicians , though the symbol varies .
The pope also offered Trump some of his latest writings , known as encyclicals , including his work on the need to protect the environment . “ Well , I will be reading them , ” Trump said .

Pope Francis once said that Christians must have “cheerful faces and eyes full of joy”. But there was little evidence of those emotions as Donald Trump descended on the Vatican on Wednesday for his first face-to-face meeting with the Argentinian pontiff.

The encounter was ultimately considered a success following a rocky start to the pair’s relationship last year, when Francis questioned Trump’s Christian credentials. But despite a warm trading of gifts and humorous exchange between Pope Francis and the first lady, Melania Trump – in which the pope asked if she fed him a popular kind of Slovenian cake – the meeting was noteworthy for its sombre tone at the start.

Greeting the US president in the papal library, Francis did not exude his usual warmth and cheerfulness even as Trump proclaimed that it was a “great honour” to meet him.

Photographs taken after their meeting showed a glum-looking pope, in contrast to the smiles when Francis met Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, who reportedly used to carry a rosary with him that was given to him by the pontiff.

The tensions were perhaps to be expected: the two disagree on the issues that lie closest to Francis’s heart, from climate change to the need to integrate and accept migrants of all faiths.

As they sat down opposite one another at a large wooden desk, Francis signalled to the president that it was best to talk out of the earshot of reporters and cameras, who were quickly led out of the papal library. The two then had a 29-minute chat with only the interpreter present, not quite as long as the nearly hour-long conversation the pope had with Obama when they met in 2014.

“Obviously there was no evidence of the great chemistry he had with Obama. There was something special there with him,” said Austen Ivereigh, the pope’s biographer.

“I think it was a solemn occasion that called for formality and protocol and both demonstrated that … they looked much more relaxed at the end,” he added.

The discussion was described as cordial in a statement by the Holy See, which said “satisfaction was expressed” for the good US relationship with the Vatican and their “joint commitment in favour of life, and freedom of worship and conscience”.



“It is hoped that there may be serene collaboration between the state and the Catholic church in the United States, engaged in service to the people in the fields of healthcare, education and assistance to immigrants,” the statement said.

Left unsaid was the fact that the Trump administration’s policies on migrants have been condemned by Francis’s allies in the US, including Joe Tobin, the archbishop of Newark, New Jersey.

They also discussed world affairs, including interfaith dialogue and peace in the Middle East, with emphasis on the protection of Christians.

Rex Tillerson, the US secretary of state who accompanied the president, later confirmed that Trump and Francis had a “pretty extensive” conversation about terrorist threats and the radicalisation of young people.

By the end of the half-hour private meeting, once the door to the library was reopened, Francis seemed more chipper. Upon meeting the first lady, he asked her whether she fed her husband potica, the pope’s favourite Slovenian dessert. An interpreter then asked Melania: “What do you give him to eat?”. It was unclear whether the first lady understood the remark, and seemed to say, “pizza?” before smiling and answering, “yes”.

The US president was also accompanied by his daughter Ivanka, her husband, Jared Kushner, national security adviser HR McMaster, and personal assistant Keith Schiller, as well as press aides.

Trump was led into the frescoed halls of the Vatican with Melania – dressed in a traditional black dress and veil, as is custom but not mandatory – walking a few feet behind him.

“It’s not like Trump Tower in New York,” a German archbishop, Georg Gänswein, could be overheard joking to Trump as the president’s entourage shuffled into a Vatican elevator.

As is customary, the two exchanged gifts. Trump offered the pope a large box that he said was filled with books written by Martin Luther King.

“This is a gift for you,” Trump was overheard saying. “I think you will enjoy them. I hope you do.”

Francis gave Trump a large medallion that depicted an olive branch, a symbol of peace, to which the president replied: “We can use peace.” The medallion is traditionally offered to politicians, though the symbol varies.

The pope also offered Trump some of his latest writings, known as encyclicals, including his work on the need to protect the environment. “Well, I will be reading them,” Trump said.

As the president left the room, he expressed gratitude to the man he once called disgraceful for questioning his faith. The dispute was related to Trump’s proposal to build a wall between Mexico and the US – a policy the pontiff had said was not Christian.

' | REUTERS Pope resigning on Feb. 28
VATICAN CITY ( AP ) - Pope Benedict XVI announced Monday that he would resign on Feb. 28 because he was simply too infirm to carry on - the first pontiff to do so in nearly 600 years . The decision sets the stage for a conclave to elect a new pope before the end of March .
The 85-year-old pope announced his decision in Latin during a meeting of Vatican cardinals on Monday morning .
He emphasized that carrying out the duties of being pope - the leader of more than a billion Roman Catholics worldwide - requires `` both strength of mind and body . ''
`` After having repeatedly examined my conscience before God , I have come to the certainty that my strengths due to an advanced age are no longer suited to an adequate exercise of the Petrine ministry , '' he told the cardinals . `` I am well aware that this ministry , due to its essential spiritual nature , must be carried out not only by words and deeds but no less with prayer and suffering .
`` However , in today 's world , subject to so many rapid changes and shaken by questions of deep relevance for the life of faith , in order to govern the barque of St. Peter and proclaim the Gospel , both strength of mind and body are necessary - strengths which in the last few months , has deteriorated in me to the extent that I have had to recognize my incapacity to adequately fulfill the ministry entrusted to me . ''
The last pope to resign was Pope Gregory XII , who stepped down in 1415 in a deal to end the Great Western Schism among competing papal claimants .
Benedict called his choice `` a decision of great importance for the life of the church . ''
The move sets the stage for the Vatican to hold a conclave to elect a new pope by mid-March , since the traditional mourning time that would follow the death of a pope does n't have to be observed .
There are several papal contenders in the wings , but no obvious front-runner - the same situation when Benedict was elected pontiff in 2005 after the death of Pope John Paul II .
When Benedict was elected pope at age 78 - already the oldest pope elected in nearly 300 years - he had been already planning to retire as the Vatican 's chief orthodoxy watchdog to spend his final years writing in the `` peace and quiet '' of his native Bavaria .
Contenders to be his successor include Cardinal Angelo Scola , archbishop of Milan , Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn , the archbishop of Vienna , and Cardinal Marc Ouellet , the Canadian head of the Vatican 's office for bishops .
Longshots include Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York . Although Dolan is popular and backs the pope 's conservative line , the general thinking is that the Catholic Church does n't need a pope from a `` superpower . ''
All cardinals under age 80 are allowed to vote in the conclave , the secret meeting held in the Sistine Chapel where cardinals cast ballots to elect a new pope . As per tradition , the ballots are burned after each voting round ; black smoke that snakes out of the chimney means no pope has been chosen , while white smoke means a pope has been elected .
Popes are allowed to resign ; church law specifies only that the resignation be `` freely made and properly manifested . ''
Only a handful have done so , however and there 's good reason why it has n't become commonplace : Might the existence of two popes - even when one has stepped down - lead to divisions and instability in the church ? Might a new resignation precedent lead to pressures on future popes to quit at the slightest hint of infirmity ?
Benedict himself raised the possibility of resigning if he were simply too old or sick to continue on in 2010 , when he was interviewed for the book `` Light of the World . ''
`` If a pope clearly realizes that he is no longer physically , psychologically and spiritually capable of handling the duties of his office , then he has a right , and under some circumstances , also an obligation to resign , '' Benedict said .
The former Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger had an intimate view as Pope John Paul II , with whom he had worked closely for nearly a quarter-century , suffered through the debilitating end of his papacy .","Benedict called his choice 'a decision of great importance for the life of the church.' | REUTERS Pope resigning on Feb. 28

He emphasized that carrying out the duties of being pope - the leader of more than a billion Roman Catholics worldwide - requires ""both strength of mind and body.""

""After having repeatedly examined my conscience before God, I have come to the certainty that my strengths due to an advanced age are no longer suited to an adequate exercise of the Petrine ministry,"" he told the cardinals. ""I am well aware that this ministry, due to its essential spiritual nature, must be carried out not only by words and deeds but no less with prayer and suffering.

""However, in today's world, subject to so many rapid changes and shaken by questions of deep relevance for the life of faith, in order to govern the barque of St. Peter and proclaim the Gospel, both strength of mind and body are necessary - strengths which in the last few months, has deteriorated in me to the extent that I have had to recognize my incapacity to adequately fulfill the ministry entrusted to me.""

The last pope to resign was Pope Gregory XII, who stepped down in 1415 in a deal to end the Great Western Schism among competing papal claimants.

Benedict called his choice ""a decision of great importance for the life of the church.""

The move sets the stage for the Vatican to hold a conclave to elect a new pope by mid-March, since the traditional mourning time that would follow the death of a pope doesn't have to be observed.

There are several papal contenders in the wings, but no obvious front-runner - the same situation when Benedict was elected pontiff in 2005 after the death of Pope John Paul II.

When Benedict was elected pope at age 78 - already the oldest pope elected in nearly 300 years - he had been already planning to retire as the Vatican's chief orthodoxy watchdog to spend his final years writing in the ""peace and quiet"" of his native Bavaria.

Contenders to be his successor include Cardinal Angelo Scola, archbishop of Milan, Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn, the archbishop of Vienna, and Cardinal Marc Ouellet, the Canadian head of the Vatican's office for bishops.

Longshots include Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York. Although Dolan is popular and backs the pope's conservative line, the general thinking is that the Catholic Church doesn't need a pope from a ""superpower.""

All cardinals under age 80 are allowed to vote in the conclave, the secret meeting held in the Sistine Chapel where cardinals cast ballots to elect a new pope. As per tradition, the ballots are burned after each voting round; black smoke that snakes out of the chimney means no pope has been chosen, while white smoke means a pope has been elected.

Popes are allowed to resign; church law specifies only that the resignation be ""freely made and properly manifested.""

Only a handful have done so, however and there's good reason why it hasn't become commonplace: Might the existence of two popes - even when one has stepped down - lead to divisions and instability in the church? Might a new resignation precedent lead to pressures on future popes to quit at the slightest hint of infirmity?

Benedict himself raised the possibility of resigning if he were simply too old or sick to continue on in 2010, when he was interviewed for the book ""Light of the World.""

""If a pope clearly realizes that he is no longer physically, psychologically and spiritually capable of handling the duties of his office, then he has a right, and under some circumstances, also an obligation to resign,"" Benedict said.

The former Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger had an intimate view as Pope John Paul II, with whom he had worked closely for nearly a quarter-century, suffered through the debilitating end of his papacy.",www.politico.com,left,S16P2OTOkGWMiiWS

religion_and_faith,Christian Science Monitor,1,http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2015/0416/Are-religious-accommodations-an-American-tradition-worth-preserving,Are religious accommodations an American tradition worth preserving?,2015-04-16,Warren Richey,"The recent backlash against “ religious accommodation ” laws in Indiana and Arkansas is evidence of an increasingly bitter confrontation that is dividing the country and threatens to diminish the scope of religious liberty in America .
That is the conclusion of a number of scholars and experts who are urging the United States Supreme Court to consider this confrontation when it hears oral argument on April 28 in a potential landmark case involving same-sex marriage .
On one side are gay couples who are seeking the full benefits of equal treatment and dignity in a society that has long forced them into second-class status , or substantially worse .
On the other side are religious conservatives , who say they are being coerced to support and/or participate in activities that offend their religious beliefs .
Gay rights activists , sensing an approaching victory at the Supreme Court , are growing more aggressive in challenging the conservatives . Many argue that any accommodation of religious beliefs in the context of gay rights would amount to a “ license to discriminate . ”
Conservatives counter that the issue is freedom of conscience . Religious accommodations traditionally have been provided to avoid the prospect of coercion against one ’ s faith , they say .
Indiana and Arkansas were just the latest flashpoints in what could become a major turning point . For the first time in US history , a sizeable social and political force seems intent on sharply restraining or eliminating religious accommodations , according to scholars who study religious freedom .
Now with the Supreme Court poised to take up same-sex marriage , some advocates are hoping the high court will offer much-needed guidance to a nation torn between conflicting values .
Some states , like Indiana , have tried to address the religious accommodation side of the equation , while others , like Utah , have taken a more comprehensive approach – addressing religion accommodations and antidiscrimination laws together .
The stakes involve more than just whether same-sex couples will be able to obtain a cake , or photographs , or flowers for their wedding . Ultimately at stake is a quintessential requirement of life in America : tolerance – on each side for the other .
Douglas Laycock , a leading scholar of religious liberty , has staked out a middle ground position in the looming confrontation between gay rights and religious rights . He calls his approach “ liberty and justice for all . ”
“ Same-sex civil marriage is a great advance for human liberty . But failure to attend to the religious-liberty implications will create a whole new set of problems for the liberties of those religious organizations and believers who can not conscientiously recognize or facilitate such marriages , ” writes Mr. Laycock , a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law , in a friend-of-the-court brief .
He is urging the high court to recognize a constitutional right to same-sex marriage . And he believes states should pass laws barring discrimination based on sexual orientation .
But he also favors robust religious freedom restoration laws at the state level , and he is urging the justices to make clear in their opinion that religious conservatives retain broad freedom to live their lives in accord with their highest sense of morality and faith .
“ The gain for human liberty will be greatly undermined if same-sex couples now force religious dissenters to violate conscience in the same way that those dissenters , when they had the power to do so , forced same-sex couples to hide in the closet , ” Laycock said .
“ That is what will happen , unless this Court clearly directs the lower courts to protect religious liberty as well as same-sex civil marriage , ” he told the justices .
In a speech last fall , Sen. Orrin Hatch ( R ) of Utah warned that religious liberty was under attack – and losing ground . “ What was once a broad consensus here in the United States that religious freedom deserves special protection has recently crumbled , ” he said .
The senator said that gay rights organizations and other advocacy groups were increasingly opposed to religious exemptions that a few years ago would have passed without dissent .
“ From my perspective , it appears that now these groups believe they are ‘ winning ’ the argument and therefore have no need for religious accommodations , ” he said . “ Whereas in the past they were willing to respect religious freedom , now that they believe they have the upper hand they are ready to disregard religious liberty altogether . ”
Last June , the Supreme Court pushed back against this trend in a 5-to-4 decision upholding a religious accommodation for the owners of Hobby Lobby .
Within weeks of that ruling , 56 senators voted to overturn the decision and eliminate the accommodation . The tally , only four votes short of the 60 needed to advance the bill , included every Senate Democrat and three Republicans .
The uproar sparked by Indiana ’ s passage of its own Religious Freedom Restoration Act ( RFRA ) in late March illustrates the potential high stakes for religious conservatives .
Indiana lawmakers and Republican Gov . Mike Pence encountered a swift and unrelenting backlash by a well-organized gay rights campaign supported by major business leaders , Democratic governors , and others threatening to unleash an economic boycott against an entire state .
Those threats prompted Republican leaders in Indiana and Arkansas to quickly retreat and water down their religious freedom laws .
It also directed a national spotlight on the intersection of gay rights and religious rights .
It did so in part by focusing on an eight-table pizza shop in Walkerton , Ind .
Memories Pizza owner Kevin O ’ Connor and his daughter , Crystal , said they would serve any gay or lesbian customers in the shop . But they added that they would refuse to cater a same-sex wedding because such a ceremony would offend their religious beliefs about marriage .
The store closed for eight days after receiving threats and hate mail . At the same time , supporters on a fundraising website contributed more than $ 840,000 to the shop .
The action against Memories Pizza erupted not from an actual request for service from a gay couple . It resulted from a hypothetical question from a local television news reporter .
Other well-known cases involve a Colorado bakery ’ s refusal to bake a wedding cake for a same-sex marriage ceremony , a New Mexico photographer ’ s refusal to photograph a same-sex commitment ceremony , and a Washington florist ’ s decision not to design floral arrangements for a same-sex wedding .
In each case , the Christian business owner said the refusal was based on a sincerely-held religious belief about the sanctity of marriage . And in each case , the courts ruled that the Christian owners violated laws prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation .
“ In the last year or so , with the rise of the push for gay rights , it is beyond wanting there to be an appreciation and respect for gay rights . Now a segment of our population is seeking to have that right trump religious freedom , ” said Jeffrey Mateer , a lawyer with Liberty Institute in Plano , Texas .
“ We are seeing people of faith being attacked , discriminated against , and losing their jobs because they are speaking out on the marriage issue , ” Mr. Mateer said .
A private evangelical college in Massachusetts may lose its accreditation over the school ’ s code of conduct that prohibits students , faculty , and staff from engaging in “ sexual relations outside of marriage and homosexual practice . ”
The Atlanta fire chief was terminated in January after officials discovered that the chief , an evangelical Christian , had written a self-published religious book in which he expressed a personal view that homosexuality was a “ sexual perversion ” morally equivalent to “ pederasty ” and “ bestiality . ”
The California Supreme Court recently enacted a rule barring all state judges from serving in any role with the Boy Scouts . The court took the action because the Boy Scouts prohibit gay men and lesbians from serving as adult leaders .
It isn ’ t just a matter of filing lawsuits or challenging the award of government benefits to certain businesses . The broader campaign often portrays religious conservatives as bigots . The strategy appears aimed at discrediting any claim to the American tradition of solicitude to religious adherents involving sincere matters of faith .
“ That ’ s one way of looking at it , ” says Yale Law School Professor William Eskridge . “ Here ’ s another way . What counts as a religious reason is highly dynamic . ”
In the 1960s , opponents of the Civil Rights Act used the Bible to try to justify continued discrimination against African-Americans , notes Professor Eskridge , a leading scholar of gay rights . It didn ’ t work . The tactic was swept aside as the tide of public opinion embraced the principle of equality for African-Americans .
Eskridge suggests it is only a matter of time before gay rights become normalized across the country , and religious and moral arguments are swept aside and discarded .
“ One of the lessons of history unfortunately is that very often the line between bigotry and religious doctrine or religious faith is not a clear-cut line , particularly when public opinion is swiftly changing , ” Eskridge said .
The professor predicted that as the nation ’ s rapid embrace of gay rights continues , public norms and the law will also change . So will religious practice and belief , he said .
“ We ’ ve already seen it . And we are going to continue to see it , ” he said . “ Some religions are literally changing their doctrine . ”
So where does that leave the state of interplay between gay rights activists and religious conservatives ?
The legal landscape is a patchwork . Even if the US Supreme Court rules in late June that all 50 states must issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples , only 22 states currently have laws prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation .
That means that gay men and lesbians are vulnerable to discrimination in 28 states .
Some observers view the recent ugly flare-up in the culture war in both states as a missed opportunity .
Had officials in Indiana and Arkansas sought to pass their new religious freedom restoration laws in concert with new legal protections for the lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender ( LGBT ) community , the energy invested in threatened boycotts and waging heated protests would have been expended instead on celebrations of leadership and progress , these analysts say .
Robin Fretwell Wilson knows how to get this done . She was an adviser to the effort do it in one of the most conservative states in America .
“ At a time of great change , people have to know what the rules are , ” says Ms. Fretwell , a professor at the University of Illinois College of Law . The idea is to get the relevant parties around a table and negotiate a set of rules acceptable to all .
It employs a common sense approach : If you are sensitive to our concerns , we ’ ll be sensitive to yours .
The result was the Utah Compromise . It passed the Republican-controlled state legislature and was signed into law last month with the blessing of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints .
When it takes effect on May 11 , it will mark the first time in state history that gay men , lesbians , bisexuals , and transgender people have specific legal protections prohibiting discrimination in housing and employment because of sexual orientation or gender identity .
“ Utah gets it right on every single score , ” Wilson says . “ They did something good and decent for the LGBT community , but they did not make it come at the expense of religious believers . I think that ’ s huge . ”
The workplace protections apply to all businesses with 15 or more workers , including state agencies , local governments , and school districts . It does not apply to religious organizations , religious schools , and wholly-owned subsidiaries of religious organizations . It also exempts the Boy Scouts .
The compromise has its critics . Some say it does not go far enough .
For example , the Utah Compromise does not address the thorny issue of public accommodations – whether a small business such as a bakery , wedding planner , or florist must participate in same-sex wedding ceremonies if they have religious objections .
But within the compromise are the seeds of a solution to that problem , as well , Wilson says .
The agreement establishes a right for any qualified person in Utah to get married at a county clerk ’ s office . But under the agreement , no official in any clerk ’ s office can be fired or otherwise forced to officiate a same-sex wedding if they have a religious objection .
Instead , every clerk ’ s office in Utah – including in rural counties – must have a process that provides a willing celebrant to any same-sex couple seeking to marry at the clerk ’ s office .
There is a term for this kind of approach . It is called religious accommodation .
Wilson says she is developing a similar model that may offer a compromise for religious business owners who are worried about getting sued over their religious objections to participating in a same-sex wedding .
In the medical field , there are recognized abortion conscience clauses that exempt certain medical professionals from involvement in that procedure because of their religious beliefs . In effect , someone else takes their place through a prearranged process .
“ When that happens , no one says you are being mean to the lady who wants an abortion , ” Wilson said . “ We don ’ t even think about it that way . ”
The same prearranged process could be set up at a Christian-owned bakery or flower shop . In essence , those parts of the business serving same-sex marriages would be handled by workers ( in-house or by contract ) who do not have a religious objection to such ceremonies .
“ The idea that you show up in the moment and get refused by a religious person is really , really hard to choke down . I don ’ t think the gay rights people are going to be able to bargain to that , ” Wilson says . “ And the idea that you suddenly let gay rights run roughshod over every religious person in the community is also hard to choke down . ”
She adds : “ So if we can find a model where everybody gets served and religious people don ’ t have to leave those jobs , I think we ’ d do a really good thing . ”
Wilson ’ s approach holds great promise , particularly in conservative red states looking for solutions or to avoid economic boycotts . But not everyone is ready and willing to negotiate a cease-fire in the culture war .
That ’ s where the concept of a RFRA may become essential as an increasing number of cases move into the courts .
Much of the controversy last month in Indiana and Arkansas was premised on misinformation and misconceptions on both sides of the debate , according to legal experts .
Some conservatives were under the false impression that a RFRA would offer guaranteed protection against lawsuits by same-sex couples . And some gay rights activists argued , incorrectly , that the Indiana RFRA would be a “ license to discriminate . ”
The debate kicked up gobs of dust and fury , but shed almost no light on the real purpose of passing a state RFRA , analysts say .
“ I don ’ t think it is right to view RFRAs in light of gay rights specifically , because RFRA has always protected religious minority groups , ” says Eric Rassbach , a lawyer at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty in Washington .
He says RFRAs have helped protect a Santeria priest seeking an exemption from a local ordinance outlawing goat sacrifices ; it is being invoked to help native Americans who need an exemption from federal law to possess eagle feathers . The law has been used to uphold the right of a Sikh accountant to pass through security at a federal building in possession of her religious “ kirpan , ” a small dull dagger that is as symbolic to Sikhs as the cross is to Christians .
In January , the US Supreme Court applied a RFRA-like statute and ruled that the Arkansas prison system must allow a Muslim inmate to grow a short beard in compliance with his religious faith . That ruling was 9 to 0 .
“ If people want to go around stopping RFRAs or neutering RFRAs , the people who are going to be hurt will be the religious minorities – the Sikhs , the native Americans , the Muslims , the Orthodox Jews , ” Mr. Rassbach said .
“ I think that is a real problem for our society because we are not getting less religiously diverse , we are becoming more heterogeneous , ” he said .
The purpose of passing a religious freedom restoration law is not to grant a right to engage in anti-gay discrimination , Rassbach and other analysts say . The law isn ’ t designed to work that way , and it hasn ’ t worked that way in practice .
No religious exemption sought under RFRA has ever been granted in any case involving alleged sexual orientation discrimination .
That doesn ’ t mean there won ’ t be an accommodation granted in the future . But these results suggest RFRA is no “ license to discriminate . ”
The real license to discriminate in Indiana was the state ’ s lack of a statute prohibiting discrimination because of sexual orientation . That is a license to discriminate , legal experts say .
In contrast , the purpose of a RFRA is different . The law is designed to allow a neutral judge to weigh the competing interests when a law that is applied broadly imposes a significant burden on sincerely-held religious beliefs .
When that happens , there must be proof that the provision advances a compelling government interest and that it is tailored to do that in a way least restrictive of religious faith .
This approach was not dreamed up in some backroom legislative chamber in Indiana . It is a legal standard that was recognized as a constitutional guarantee for the entire country and was enforced by the US Supreme Court from 1963 to 1990 .
In 1963 the Supreme Court granted a religious exemption to a Seventh Day Adventist who was denied unemployment benefits after she was fired for refusing to work on her Sabbath day .
In 1972 , the high court reaffirmed this pro-religion accommodation standard when it granted a religious exemption to Amish families who objected to a Wisconsin law that required all children under 17 to attend public school . The state law clashed with Amish traditions , including home-schooling older children .
In 1981 , the Supreme Court granted a religious exemption to a Jehovah ’ s Witness who was denied unemployment compensation benefits after he lost his job for refusing to work in a department that produced war materials .
Despite this broad , constitutional protection of religious conscience , religious adherents didn ’ t always prevail . In 1983 , Bob Jones University argued for a religious exemption from a federal regulation prohibiting tax-exempt organizations from discriminating on the basis of race . The university had a rule barring interracial dating .
The high court held that the government had a fundamental – and overriding – interest in ending any vestige of racial discrimination in education .
Though the decision did not diminish the importance of religious accommodations in general , it put religious adherents on notice : fighting discrimination is a compelling government interest that can outweigh a claim for religious accommodation .
Then , in 1990 , the high court abruptly changed course . The justices were presented with a case involving two drug counselors who were fired for their sacramental use of peyote as members of the Native American Church . They were also denied unemployment benefits . The two sued the state of Oregon , seeking a religious accommodation that would allow them to collect the benefits .
A divided Supreme Court ruled that the free exercise clause of the Constitution did not authorize a religious exemption from laws of general applicability .
This was a major constitutional shift that made it more difficult for religious adherents – particularly those in minority religions – to seek accommodations from general laws that imposed significant burdens on their faith .
Congress responded in 1993 by passing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act . ( It passed the House by voice vote , and the Senate 97 to 3 . ) The statute reestablished the same national legal standard of religious accommodation that had been enforced by the high court from 1963 to 1990 .
Then in 1997 , the Supreme Court ruled that the federal RFRA only applied to federal law , not at the state or local level .
In response to that decision , states began enacting their own religious freedom restoration acts . Currently , 22 states – including Indiana and Arkansas – have enacted RFRAs .
In addition , 11 other states have interpreted their state constitutions as providing guarantees of religious liberty consistent with the standard enforced by the US Supreme Court from 1963 to 1990 .
Thus , 33 of the 50 states have in some fashion embraced the broad concept of offering religious accommodations .
How the approaching legal battles will play out is uncertain .
Some cases will be preempted by automatic exemptions from discrimination laws that have long been granted to religious organizations and affiliated groups .
But the stage is now set for litigation over public accommodations related to same-sex marriages . Ironically , most of those cases will be litigated not in conservative “ red ” states , but in liberal “ blue ” states that have already accepted gay marriage . That ’ s because there are no antidiscrimination statutes in most red states that would allow a same-sex couple to file a lawsuit .
“ It is that middle area of the small business , individual proprietorship , the mom and pop enterprise ; that ’ s the area where this is going to bite , ” Eskridge says . “ That is in play and it is highly dynamic . ”
The professor sees the legal landscape shifting against accommodation claims . “ Accommodations that would have been given in courts 10 years ago are not going to be given in courts 10 years from now , or even today in some cases . ”
In courts across the country the critical question is going to be whether it is possible to strike a balance between discrimination and religious accommodation .
What is at stake is more fundamental than cakes , and photographs , and flowers . It is whether at some point politicians and judges begin to look for ways to defuse disputes so that both sides can start moving forward together toward tolerance and acceptance .
“ What was so devastating for the religious community was to be seen as saying we have to have our religious freedom so that we can knock down your gay rights . When they say stuff like that – which is just ugly – they lose , ” Wilson says .
“ But on the other side , if the gay rights guys say I have to run you out of business in order for me to win , that is just as ugly , and they will lose , ” she says .","The recent backlash against “religious accommodation” laws in Indiana and Arkansas is evidence of an increasingly bitter confrontation that is dividing the country and threatens to diminish the scope of religious liberty in America.

A middle-ground position for Supreme Court?

Douglas Laycock, a leading scholar of religious liberty, has staked out a middle ground position in the looming confrontation between gay rights and religious rights. He calls his approach “liberty and justice for all.”

“Same-sex civil marriage is a great advance for human liberty. But failure to attend to the religious-liberty implications will create a whole new set of problems for the liberties of those religious organizations and believers who cannot conscientiously recognize or facilitate such marriages,” writes Mr. Laycock, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law, in a friend-of-the-court brief.

He is urging the high court to recognize a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. And he believes states should pass laws barring discrimination based on sexual orientation.

But he also favors robust religious freedom restoration laws at the state level, and he is urging the justices to make clear in their opinion that religious conservatives retain broad freedom to live their lives in accord with their highest sense of morality and faith.

“The gain for human liberty will be greatly undermined if same-sex couples now force religious dissenters to violate conscience in the same way that those dissenters, when they had the power to do so, forced same-sex couples to hide in the closet,” Laycock said.

“That is what will happen, unless this Court clearly directs the lower courts to protect religious liberty as well as same-sex civil marriage,” he told the justices.

In a speech last fall, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R) of Utah warned that religious liberty was under attack – and losing ground. “What was once a broad consensus here in the United States that religious freedom deserves special protection has recently crumbled,” he said.

The senator said that gay rights organizations and other advocacy groups were increasingly opposed to religious exemptions that a few years ago would have passed without dissent.

“From my perspective, it appears that now these groups believe they are ‘winning’ the argument and therefore have no need for religious accommodations,” he said. “Whereas in the past they were willing to respect religious freedom, now that they believe they have the upper hand they are ready to disregard religious liberty altogether.”

Last June, the Supreme Court pushed back against this trend in a 5-to-4 decision upholding a religious accommodation for the owners of Hobby Lobby.

Within weeks of that ruling, 56 senators voted to overturn the decision and eliminate the accommodation. The tally, only four votes short of the 60 needed to advance the bill, included every Senate Democrat and three Republicans.

Backlash in Indiana and beyond

The uproar sparked by Indiana’s passage of its own Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) in late March illustrates the potential high stakes for religious conservatives.

Indiana lawmakers and Republican Gov. Mike Pence encountered a swift and unrelenting backlash by a well-organized gay rights campaign supported by major business leaders, Democratic governors, and others threatening to unleash an economic boycott against an entire state.

Those threats prompted Republican leaders in Indiana and Arkansas to quickly retreat and water down their religious freedom laws.

It also directed a national spotlight on the intersection of gay rights and religious rights.

It did so in part by focusing on an eight-table pizza shop in Walkerton, Ind.

Memories Pizza owner Kevin O’Connor and his daughter, Crystal, said they would serve any gay or lesbian customers in the shop. But they added that they would refuse to cater a same-sex wedding because such a ceremony would offend their religious beliefs about marriage.

The store closed for eight days after receiving threats and hate mail. At the same time, supporters on a fundraising website contributed more than $840,000 to the shop.

The action against Memories Pizza erupted not from an actual request for service from a gay couple. It resulted from a hypothetical question from a local television news reporter.

Other well-known cases involve a Colorado bakery’s refusal to bake a wedding cake for a same-sex marriage ceremony, a New Mexico photographer’s refusal to photograph a same-sex commitment ceremony, and a Washington florist’s decision not to design floral arrangements for a same-sex wedding.

In each case, the Christian business owner said the refusal was based on a sincerely-held religious belief about the sanctity of marriage. And in each case, the courts ruled that the Christian owners violated laws prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation.

“In the last year or so, with the rise of the push for gay rights, it is beyond wanting there to be an appreciation and respect for gay rights. Now a segment of our population is seeking to have that right trump religious freedom,” said Jeffrey Mateer, a lawyer with Liberty Institute in Plano, Texas.

“We are seeing people of faith being attacked, discriminated against, and losing their jobs because they are speaking out on the marriage issue,” Mr. Mateer said.

Among other cases cited by conservatives:

A private evangelical college in Massachusetts may lose its accreditation over the school’s code of conduct that prohibits students, faculty, and staff from engaging in “sexual relations outside of marriage and homosexual practice.”

The Atlanta fire chief was terminated in January after officials discovered that the chief, an evangelical Christian, had written a self-published religious book in which he expressed a personal view that homosexuality was a “sexual perversion” morally equivalent to “pederasty” and “bestiality.”

The California Supreme Court recently enacted a rule barring all state judges from serving in any role with the Boy Scouts. The court took the action because the Boy Scouts prohibit gay men and lesbians from serving as adult leaders.

A 'highly dynamic' area of law

It isn’t just a matter of filing lawsuits or challenging the award of government benefits to certain businesses. The broader campaign often portrays religious conservatives as bigots. The strategy appears aimed at discrediting any claim to the American tradition of solicitude to religious adherents involving sincere matters of faith.

“That’s one way of looking at it,” says Yale Law School Professor William Eskridge. “Here’s another way. What counts as a religious reason is highly dynamic.”

In the 1960s, opponents of the Civil Rights Act used the Bible to try to justify continued discrimination against African-Americans, notes Professor Eskridge, a leading scholar of gay rights. It didn’t work. The tactic was swept aside as the tide of public opinion embraced the principle of equality for African-Americans.

Eskridge suggests it is only a matter of time before gay rights become normalized across the country, and religious and moral arguments are swept aside and discarded.

“One of the lessons of history unfortunately is that very often the line between bigotry and religious doctrine or religious faith is not a clear-cut line, particularly when public opinion is swiftly changing,” Eskridge said.

The professor predicted that as the nation’s rapid embrace of gay rights continues, public norms and the law will also change. So will religious practice and belief, he said.

“We’ve already seen it. And we are going to continue to see it,” he said. “Some religions are literally changing their doctrine.”

Utah's seeds of a solution

So where does that leave the state of interplay between gay rights activists and religious conservatives?

The legal landscape is a patchwork. Even if the US Supreme Court rules in late June that all 50 states must issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, only 22 states currently have laws prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation.

That means that gay men and lesbians are vulnerable to discrimination in 28 states.

Among those 28 states: Indiana and Arkansas.

Some observers view the recent ugly flare-up in the culture war in both states as a missed opportunity.

Had officials in Indiana and Arkansas sought to pass their new religious freedom restoration laws in concert with new legal protections for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community, the energy invested in threatened boycotts and waging heated protests would have been expended instead on celebrations of leadership and progress, these analysts say.

Robin Fretwell Wilson knows how to get this done. She was an adviser to the effort do it in one of the most conservative states in America.

“At a time of great change, people have to know what the rules are,” says Ms. Fretwell, a professor at the University of Illinois College of Law. The idea is to get the relevant parties around a table and negotiate a set of rules acceptable to all.

It employs a common sense approach: If you are sensitive to our concerns, we’ll be sensitive to yours.

The result was the Utah Compromise. It passed the Republican-controlled state legislature and was signed into law last month with the blessing of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

When it takes effect on May 11, it will mark the first time in state history that gay men, lesbians, bisexuals, and transgender people have specific legal protections prohibiting discrimination in housing and employment because of sexual orientation or gender identity.

“Utah gets it right on every single score,” Wilson says. “They did something good and decent for the LGBT community, but they did not make it come at the expense of religious believers. I think that’s huge.”

The workplace protections apply to all businesses with 15 or more workers, including state agencies, local governments, and school districts. It does not apply to religious organizations, religious schools, and wholly-owned subsidiaries of religious organizations. It also exempts the Boy Scouts.

The compromise has its critics. Some say it does not go far enough.

For example, the Utah Compromise does not address the thorny issue of public accommodations – whether a small business such as a bakery, wedding planner, or florist must participate in same-sex wedding ceremonies if they have religious objections.

But within the compromise are the seeds of a solution to that problem, as well, Wilson says.

The agreement establishes a right for any qualified person in Utah to get married at a county clerk’s office. But under the agreement, no official in any clerk’s office can be fired or otherwise forced to officiate a same-sex wedding if they have a religious objection.

Instead, every clerk’s office in Utah – including in rural counties – must have a process that provides a willing celebrant to any same-sex couple seeking to marry at the clerk’s office.

There is a term for this kind of approach. It is called religious accommodation.

Wilson says she is developing a similar model that may offer a compromise for religious business owners who are worried about getting sued over their religious objections to participating in a same-sex wedding.

In the medical field, there are recognized abortion conscience clauses that exempt certain medical professionals from involvement in that procedure because of their religious beliefs. In effect, someone else takes their place through a prearranged process.

“When that happens, no one says you are being mean to the lady who wants an abortion,” Wilson said. “We don’t even think about it that way.”

The same prearranged process could be set up at a Christian-owned bakery or flower shop. In essence, those parts of the business serving same-sex marriages would be handled by workers (in-house or by contract) who do not have a religious objection to such ceremonies.

“The idea that you show up in the moment and get refused by a religious person is really, really hard to choke down. I don’t think the gay rights people are going to be able to bargain to that,” Wilson says. “And the idea that you suddenly let gay rights run roughshod over every religious person in the community is also hard to choke down.”

She adds: “So if we can find a model where everybody gets served and religious people don’t have to leave those jobs, I think we’d do a really good thing.”

Wilson’s approach holds great promise, particularly in conservative red states looking for solutions or to avoid economic boycotts. But not everyone is ready and willing to negotiate a cease-fire in the culture war.

That’s where the concept of a RFRA may become essential as an increasing number of cases move into the courts.

Confusion over what an RFRA actually does

Much of the controversy last month in Indiana and Arkansas was premised on misinformation and misconceptions on both sides of the debate, according to legal experts.

Some conservatives were under the false impression that a RFRA would offer guaranteed protection against lawsuits by same-sex couples. And some gay rights activists argued, incorrectly, that the Indiana RFRA would be a “license to discriminate.”

Uncritical press reports parroted this line, over and over.

The debate kicked up gobs of dust and fury, but shed almost no light on the real purpose of passing a state RFRA, analysts say.

“I don’t think it is right to view RFRAs in light of gay rights specifically, because RFRA has always protected religious minority groups,” says Eric Rassbach, a lawyer at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty in Washington.

He says RFRAs have helped protect a Santeria priest seeking an exemption from a local ordinance outlawing goat sacrifices; it is being invoked to help native Americans who need an exemption from federal law to possess eagle feathers. The law has been used to uphold the right of a Sikh accountant to pass through security at a federal building in possession of her religious “kirpan,” a small dull dagger that is as symbolic to Sikhs as the cross is to Christians.

In January, the US Supreme Court applied a RFRA-like statute and ruled that the Arkansas prison system must allow a Muslim inmate to grow a short beard in compliance with his religious faith. That ruling was 9 to 0.

“If people want to go around stopping RFRAs or neutering RFRAs, the people who are going to be hurt will be the religious minorities – the Sikhs, the native Americans, the Muslims, the Orthodox Jews,” Mr. Rassbach said.

“I think that is a real problem for our society because we are not getting less religiously diverse, we are becoming more heterogeneous,” he said.

The purpose of passing a religious freedom restoration law is not to grant a right to engage in anti-gay discrimination, Rassbach and other analysts say. The law isn’t designed to work that way, and it hasn’t worked that way in practice.

No religious exemption sought under RFRA has ever been granted in any case involving alleged sexual orientation discrimination.

That doesn’t mean there won’t be an accommodation granted in the future. But these results suggest RFRA is no “license to discriminate.”

The real license to discriminate in Indiana was the state’s lack of a statute prohibiting discrimination because of sexual orientation. That is a license to discriminate, legal experts say.

In contrast, the purpose of a RFRA is different. The law is designed to allow a neutral judge to weigh the competing interests when a law that is applied broadly imposes a significant burden on sincerely-held religious beliefs.

When that happens, there must be proof that the provision advances a compelling government interest and that it is tailored to do that in a way least restrictive of religious faith.

How courts have viewed the issue

This approach was not dreamed up in some backroom legislative chamber in Indiana. It is a legal standard that was recognized as a constitutional guarantee for the entire country and was enforced by the US Supreme Court from 1963 to 1990.

In 1963 the Supreme Court granted a religious exemption to a Seventh Day Adventist who was denied unemployment benefits after she was fired for refusing to work on her Sabbath day.

In 1972, the high court reaffirmed this pro-religion accommodation standard when it granted a religious exemption to Amish families who objected to a Wisconsin law that required all children under 17 to attend public school. The state law clashed with Amish traditions, including home-schooling older children.

In 1981, the Supreme Court granted a religious exemption to a Jehovah’s Witness who was denied unemployment compensation benefits after he lost his job for refusing to work in a department that produced war materials.

Despite this broad, constitutional protection of religious conscience, religious adherents didn’t always prevail. In 1983, Bob Jones University argued for a religious exemption from a federal regulation prohibiting tax-exempt organizations from discriminating on the basis of race. The university had a rule barring interracial dating.

The high court held that the government had a fundamental – and overriding – interest in ending any vestige of racial discrimination in education.

Though the decision did not diminish the importance of religious accommodations in general, it put religious adherents on notice: fighting discrimination is a compelling government interest that can outweigh a claim for religious accommodation.

Then, in 1990, the high court abruptly changed course. The justices were presented with a case involving two drug counselors who were fired for their sacramental use of peyote as members of the Native American Church. They were also denied unemployment benefits. The two sued the state of Oregon, seeking a religious accommodation that would allow them to collect the benefits.

A divided Supreme Court ruled that the free exercise clause of the Constitution did not authorize a religious exemption from laws of general applicability.

This was a major constitutional shift that made it more difficult for religious adherents – particularly those in minority religions – to seek accommodations from general laws that imposed significant burdens on their faith.

Congress responded in 1993 by passing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. (It passed the House by voice vote, and the Senate 97 to 3.) The statute reestablished the same national legal standard of religious accommodation that had been enforced by the high court from 1963 to 1990.

Then in 1997, the Supreme Court ruled that the federal RFRA only applied to federal law, not at the state or local level.

In response to that decision, states began enacting their own religious freedom restoration acts. Currently, 22 states – including Indiana and Arkansas – have enacted RFRAs.

In addition, 11 other states have interpreted their state constitutions as providing guarantees of religious liberty consistent with the standard enforced by the US Supreme Court from 1963 to 1990.

Thus, 33 of the 50 states have in some fashion embraced the broad concept of offering religious accommodations.

Where we go from here

How the approaching legal battles will play out is uncertain.

Some cases will be preempted by automatic exemptions from discrimination laws that have long been granted to religious organizations and affiliated groups.

But the stage is now set for litigation over public accommodations related to same-sex marriages. Ironically, most of those cases will be litigated not in conservative “red” states, but in liberal “blue” states that have already accepted gay marriage. That’s because there are no antidiscrimination statutes in most red states that would allow a same-sex couple to file a lawsuit.

“It is that middle area of the small business, individual proprietorship, the mom and pop enterprise; that’s the area where this is going to bite,” Eskridge says. “That is in play and it is highly dynamic.”

The professor sees the legal landscape shifting against accommodation claims. “Accommodations that would have been given in courts 10 years ago are not going to be given in courts 10 years from now, or even today in some cases.”

In courts across the country the critical question is going to be whether it is possible to strike a balance between discrimination and religious accommodation.

What is at stake is more fundamental than cakes, and photographs, and flowers. It is whether at some point politicians and judges begin to look for ways to defuse disputes so that both sides can start moving forward together toward tolerance and acceptance.

The alternative is more Indiana-style protests and boycotts.

“What was so devastating for the religious community was to be seen as saying we have to have our religious freedom so that we can knock down your gay rights. When they say stuff like that – which is just ugly – they lose,” Wilson says.

“But on the other side, if the gay rights guys say I have to run you out of business in order for me to win, that is just as ugly, and they will lose,” she says.",www.csmonitor.com,center,fT29oFjodKDUBo5L

The California Court of Appeals rules that a transgender patient can sue a Catholic hospital for refusing to perform a hysterectomy .
Yesterday , the California Court of Appeals issued a truly remarkable opinion in a truly remarkable case . It held that a Catholic hospital could indeed face legal liability for failing to perform a hysterectomy as part of a female-to-male “ transition ” — even though its policy broadly bans sterilization surgery generally ( not just for trans individuals ) and even though the hospital referred the patient to a non-Catholic facility in the same network . The patient obtained the hysterectomy a mere three days after the original scheduled surgery date and sued anyway .
The facts of the case are simple . The plaintiff , Evan Minton , initially scheduled a hysterectomy for August 30 , 2016 , at Mercy San Juan Medical Center ( part of the Dignity Health hospital network ) as a treatment for gender dysphoria . Mercy is a Catholic hospital , and the day before the scheduled surgery , Mercy canceled the procedure . It cited the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops ’ “ Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services. ” As the court noted , “ The Directives prohibit direct sterilization and require that bodily and functional integrity be protected and preserved . ”
In other words , a Catholic hospital was upholding basic Catholic religious doctrine .
Mercy ’ s president then recommended that Minton ’ s doctor obtain emergency admitting privileges at nearby Methodist Hospital , which is also a Dignity Health facility . The doctor obtained privileges and performed the surgery on September 2 , 2016 . Minton then sued Dignity Health , claiming that he was the victim of gender identity discrimination .
The trial court dismissed his complaint , but yesterday the California Court of Appeals revived his claims . It held that Dignity Health could protect the religious liberty of its Catholic institutions only if “ it can provide all persons with full and equal medical care at comparable facilities not subject to the same religious restrictions . ”
It also held that even the short , three-day waiting period between the initial scheduled surgery at Mercy and the actual surgery at Methodist did not constitute “ full and equal medical care. ” Instead , the court wrote , the plaintiff “ experienced a startling and painful notification that the surgery would not go forward. ” When the plaintiff ’ s surgery was cancelled , “ he was subjected to discrimination . ”
Note the burden this ruling places on Catholic institutions — they will be compelled to provide care unless they actively facilitate the provision of care elsewhere , and even the most brief delays are legally intolerable .
The case was decided under California state law , by a California appeals court , applying a California statutory and constitutional analysis . But the federal constitution applies here as well , and that brings me to the Supreme Court . This upcoming term it can decide a case that could and should transform the fight for religious liberty and decisively protect the right of religious institutions to uphold church teachings in the provision of their public services .
That case is called Sharonell Fulton v. City of Philadelphia , and the pending cert petition challenges the city ’ s punitive actions against Catholic Social Services based on CSS ’ s refusal to “ provide written endorsements for same-sex couples which contradict its religious teachings on marriage. ” While Fulton and the California case are obviously not identical , a ruling protecting religious liberty in Fulton would create a federal precedent that the California state court would be required to consider .
Moreover , the petitioners in Fulton are asking the Supreme Court to correct a historical wrong . They ’ re asking the court to reverse Antonin Scalia ’ s great mistake — his opinion in Employment Division v. Smith that gutted the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment and greatly expanded state authority over religious individuals and religious institutions .
At present , blue states across the United States are attempting to use expansive nondiscrimination to coerce religious institutions to violate their religious principles as a condition for providing charitable or commercial services in their states . Even in the absence of evidence that any LGBT person has been denied access to adoption services or medical care , states are still bringing down the hammer .
For example , in Fulton , the city took action against CSS even though not one LGBT couple had approached CSS for foster services from its opening in 1917 through the filing of the case in 2018 . In the California case , the court ruled that there could be actionable discrimination even though the LGBT plaintiff obtained the services he sought from the defendant in the case .
Given these facts , it often appears as if activist states ( and their activist allies at , for example , the ACLU ) are less interested in ensuring that LGBT patients and families have access to care or services ( which they do ) than in bringing religious organizations into compliance with the moral mandates of the sexual revolution .
Make no mistake , there are times when religious-liberty claims should yield to nondiscrimination statutes . The Supreme Court was right to decide in Newman v.

ANALYSIS/OPINION:

President Obama put on his preaching clothes yesterday and drove up Connecticut Avenue to the Washington Hilton to deliver a sermon to the choir. He took his text from the first chapter of the Book of Moral Equivalence and let the choir have both barrels.

He spoke from the pulpit of the National Prayer Breakfast, organized as an occasion of Christian congressmen six decades ago, and has evolved into an occasion for politicians to come together not so much to pray as to be seen praying. Such prayers are often lectures to heaven, attempts to straighten God out on what’s going on down here.

Mr. Obama has so far been unable to talk very much about Islamic terrorism, or even to say the words “Islamic” and “terrorism” in the same sentence. Perhaps the prayer breakfast was the time and place he had been waiting for, to say what everyone in the world knows is true, that Islam, distorted or not, has been giving the world a royal pain in that certain private place, and should straighten up and fly right into the 21st century.

Alas, no. If he wants an appropriate time and place, he’s still looking for it. His speechwriters gave him the usual things to say about religious freedom, the trite and true about how everybody should have the right to practice his faith however he chooses, to change his faith if he chooses, or to practice no faith at all if that’s what nourishes his soul, and no offense if he thinks he doesn’t have one. (The pronouns here are collective, including both male and female, but the president, who is politically correct to a considerable fault, avoids pronouns except the vertical one.)

He didn’t call out anyone by name, though the place in the world where someone risks keeping his head on his shoulders for changing his religious “faith” is neither Presbyterian nor Buddhist, Hindu nor Hottentot. So where are the places the fatwa is feared, where an imam can casually write a sentence of death for the faithful to carry out? He didn’t say. He probably figured everyone already knows the answer to that one.

How can people of faith, he asks, reconcile “the profound good, the strength, the tenacity, the compassion and love that can flow from all our faiths operate alongside those who seek to hijack religious [faith] for their own murderous ends?”

Humanity, he said, has been grappling with this puzzle throughout history, and just to make sure that everyone knows who he’s talking about, he called out offenders by name.

“Lest we get on our high horse and think this is unique to some other place, remember that during the Crusades and the Inquisition, people committed terrible deeds in the name of Christ. In our home country, slavery and Jim Crow all too often was justified in the name of Christ.”

The president is correct, of course, that many bad things have been done by people who called themselves Christians. But they were not celebrated in the faith for the sin and the outrage, bur roundly rebuked: In the words of the ancient black spiritual, “everybody talkin’ ‘bout heaven ain’t goin’ there.” If Mr. Obama wants to think Jim Crow was a Baptist deacon, he’s entitled, and rebuking the hubris of Christians, to challenge them to dismount from the high horse, is a useful thing to do.

But given the widespread and well-founded suspicion that Mr. Obama is soft on those who, as he says, distort Islam to justify jihad, why did he choose a Christian prayer breakfast to equate the faith of most of his constituents to the barbarism of the cult whose proper name he cannot bring himself to say?

Intolerance is all about us, and confronting it is often difficult, and most Christians agree with the president that God compels the faithful to try. Mr. Obama’s prescription is a useful one, and maybe in a rare fit of introspection he was preaching not only to the choir but to himself.

“First,” he said, “we should start with some basic humility. I believe that the starting point of faith is some doubt — not being so full of yourself and so confident that you are right and that God speaks only to us, and doesn’t speak to others, that somehow we alone are in possession of the truth.”

Strong words, and welcome words. We all need to hear them. But the president’s invoking the Crusades — the last Crusader left Europe for Jerusalem 700 years ago — sounds like something remembered from a radical mosque. He’s preaching tolerance to the wrong congregation.

""I think that the fact is that it's not just words on the part of this administration,"" said Frank Gaffney. ""I believe that the President's efforts on behalf of Pastor Brunson made clear that he used the instruments of American power.""

Gaffney, CEO of Save the Persecuted Christians, says it's now up to the rest of the world to follow suit.

""The most important message, he very much did deliver on the fact by his presence at this event. He put the nations of the world on notice,"" he said.

The President urged nations to repeal laws that restrict religious freedom and increase prosecution towards crimes against people of faith.

""To stop the crimes against people of faith, release prisoners of conscience, repeal laws restricting freedom of religion and belief, protect the vulnerable, the defenseless, and the oppressed, America stands with believers in every country who ask only for the freedom to live according to the faith that is within their own hearts,"" he said.",www1.cbn.com,right,3DhvFK8pGqxEmhQb

The Argentinian is not the first pope from outside Europe

He uses public transportation and refused to elevate himself on a platform above cardinals

From the Vatican to Buenos Aires, Catholics worldwide rejoiced when Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio became the new pope.

He's the first Jesuit and the first Latin American in modern times to lead the world's 1.2 billion Catholics.

But in some ways, he's just a normal guy.

Here are five things to know about Pope Francis:

1. His name says a lot about him

Unlike other recent pontiffs -- John Paul II, Benedict XVI -- Pope Francis doesn't have a numeral after his name. That's because he's the first to take the name Francis.

The pope wanted to honor St. Francis of Assisi , an admirer of nature and a servant to the poor and destitute.

St. Francis of Assisi was born the son of a rich cloth merchant. But he lived in rags among beggars at St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.

Those close to Pope Francis see similarities between the two men.

""Francis of Assisi is ... someone who turned his back on the wealth of his family and the lifestyle he had, and bonded with lepers and the poor,"" said the Rev. Thomas Rosica, the Vatican's deputy spokesman. ""Here's this pope known for his care for AIDS patients and people who are very sick. Who is known for his concern with single mothers whose babies were refused to be baptized by priests in his diocese.

""He scolded those priests last year and said, 'How can you turn these people away when they belong to us? '""

2. He's not actually the first pope from outside Europe

Sure, Francis is the first non-European pope in modern times. But back in the 8th century, a Syrian -- Pope St. Gregory III -- led the church from 731 to 741 A.D.

We've also had popes from Bethlehem (St. Evaristus, from 97 to 105 A.D.), Jerusalem (Pope Theodore I, from 642 to 649) and modern-day Libya (Saint Victor I, from 189 to 199). Several other Syrians have also been pontiff in the last few millennia.

Of course, the majority of popes have been Italian. But with Francis' appointment, the tide could be shifting to outside Europe.

3. He's a pope of the people

In some ways, Pope Francis is just a normal guy.

""The new pope is a very humble man,"" said the Rev. Eduardo Mangiarotti, an Argentine priest. ""He takes public transport every day.""

He also chose to live in an apartment instead of the archbishop's palace, passed on a chauffeured limousine and cooked his own meals, CNN Vatican analyst John Allen wrote in a profile published by National Catholic Reporter.

In his first public act as pontiff, Pope Francis broke with tradition by asking the estimated 150,000 people packed into St. Peter's Square to pray for him, rather than him blessing the crowd first.

""He is a very simple man,"" said Luis R. Zarama, auxiliary bishop of Atlanta. ""It's very clear from the way he approached the people and asked them to bless him and pray for him. It's a beautiful sign of closeness and humility.""

The pontiff broke with another tradition by refusing to use a platform to elevate himself above the cardinals standing with him as he was introduced to the world as Pope Francis.

""He said I'll stay down here,"" said Cardinal Timothy Dolan, archbishop of New York and the president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. ""He met each of us on our own level.""

4. He comes with a side of controversy

Francis opposes same-sex marriage and abortion, which isn't surprising as leader of the socially conservative Catholic church.

But as a cardinal, Francis clashed with the government of Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner over his opposition to gay marriage and free distribution of contraceptives.

His career as a priest in Argentina coincided with the so-called Dirty War -- and some say the church didn't do enough to confront the military dictatorship.

As many as 30,000 people died or disappeared during the seven-year period that began with a coup in 1976.

""Our research focused on the plight of the disappeared,"" said Susanna Flood, media director for Amnesty International.

5. He faces a host of challenges ahead

Francis takes the helm of a church that has been rocked in recent years by sex abuse by priests and claims of corruption and infighting among the church hierarchy.

He may need to find a way to draw new Catholics into the church where it is in decline, said Phillip M. Thompson, executive director of the Aquinas Center of Theology at Emory University.

And he'll also need to find ways of working with shifting viewpoints among Catholics. In the United States, for example, 90% of Catholics are using contraception and 82% think it is morally permissible.

""The church has conservative positions on human sexuality, bioethics, etc., but liberal positions on issues such as economic regulation, the death penalty and immigration,"" Thompson said.

The president previewed his idea earlier this month at the Evangelicals for Trump rally at the King Jesus International Ministry in Florida , saying he would take action to safeguard students ' and teachers ' First Amendment rights to pray in school .
`` We will not allow faithful Americans to be bullied by the hard Left , '' Trump said .
Now the US Department of Education is sending letters to officials in all 50 states to ensure students and teachers do n't face discrimination for practicing their right of religious freedom .
Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos explained the new rules protect students ' right to pray , but they also go beyond that to protect faith-based student groups and much more : `` The Department 's efforts will level the playing field between religious and non-religious organizations competing for federal grants , as well as protect First Amendment freedoms on campus and the religious liberty of faith-based institutions . ''
White House Domestic Policy Director Joe Grogan said , `` We 're going to be making it clear that students have the right to pray publicly in school if they so choose . ''
Due to cases where the law has been misunderstood , today 's announcement reinforces what 's on the books . Grogan says it will `` remind the chief education officers in all 50 states that students have the right to pray at their own direction , to gather at their own direction , to bring the Bible to school if they choose to , to bring the Koran or the Torah in . ''
The bottom line is this : Public schools now risk losing federal funds if they violate students ' rights to religious expression .
The prayer announcement comes on Religious Freedom Day , an annual event held on January 16 to mark America 's long history of protecting religious liberty going all the way back to the 1786 passage of Thomas Jefferson 's Virginia Statute of Religious Freedom .
`` A society without religion can not prosper . A nation without faith can not endure , because justice , goodness and peace can not prevail without the glory of Almighty God , '' Trump said this month at his evangelical rally . `` For America to thrive in the 21st Century we must renew faith and family as the center of American life . ''
`` These angry radicals want to impose absolute conformity by censoring speech , tearing down crosses and symbols of faith and banning religious believers from public life , '' he said . `` But we will not back down , we are standing tall for the values that we hold dear . ''
`` I will be taking action to safeguard students ' and teachers ' First Amendment rights to pray in our schools , '' Trump said . `` They want to take that right along with many other rights . ''
`` My administration will never stop fighting for Americans of faith , '' he said . `` I really do believe we have God on our side . ''
Franklin Graham tweeted , `` Thank you President Trump for protecting and empowering the right to student-led prayer in schools . ''
Dr. David Jeremiah , pastor of Shadow Mountain Community Church , praised the president 's effort to defend the right to pray in school .
`` President Trump has made the right decision to give America 's children permission to pray again in our public schools . It 's absurd that generations of our children , in our public schools , have been raised to think that there 's little to no place for faith outside of one 's church , one 's home or one 's heart . Our public schools ought to be places where people of faith feel free to be who they are , and -of course- no one really believes doing so constitutes enforcing one 's personal faith on another . Our founding fathers would be utterly astonished that the one thing we thought wise was to deprive our children of their faith through America 's education system . Ca n't we just agree that America is better off when people of faith pray , beginning with our children ? ''
Family Research Council President Tony Perkins said , `` For years , we 've watched secularists pressure school administrators into telling students that they ca n't pray , read their Bibles , or talk about their faith in class . Some school officials are willing participants in the secularists ' intimidation campaign while others fear the lack of funding to fight threatened lawsuits . Now the tables are turned . The onus is now on states to certify that they are compliant with U.S. Department of Education guidelines which protect students ' religious freedom . If schools fail to protect religious freedom , they now run the risk of losing federal funding . With this and his other announced rules , President Trump is continuing the drumbeat of religious freedom and the long march toward restoring religious freedom in the public square . ''
Rev . Johnnie Moore , a commissioner for the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom , is applauding the move , saying it 's just the latest proof that President Trump is a champion of religious freedom .
`` The White House is n't saying whether one should pray or to whom or what they should pray to , they are simply making it clear that in the United States students have First Amendment rights also , and our 'separation of church and state ' was n't intended to suppress a vibrant religious life in America but to facilitate it . Jefferson 's letter to the Danbury Baptists , where he referenced this separation , was actually more about protecting the church from the State than the State from the church , '' Moore said .
He says he experienced a taste of the discrimination that other faith-filled students often experience in America 's public schools .
`` I found my personal faith in middle and high school as my family moved several times among multiple states and I attended multiple public schools . When I became passionate about my Christianity , I decided to start prayer meetings at each of my schools . I generally did so outside of school - before school - because these public schools , even in the Bible Belt , had a total paranoia about the separation of church and state which required us students to pray in the cold or rain , outside , '' Moore recalls .
`` Even in those environments that were more open , the approval processes seemed intentionally burdensome . I was once called into a principal 's office in one of my high schools for trying to have a Bible study during the lunch hour . It was totally absurd . ''
Rev . Samuel Rodriguez , president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference , said , `` This is a decision that should be celebrated by Democrats and by Republicans , by the religious and the irreligious , by all Americans from sea to shining sea who recognize the brilliance of the American idea was n't in a fear of religion but in the vibrancy of faith . Faith to believe that God exists or that he does n't , faith to pray before we legislate or anchor our pledge and our currency in subservience to a higher power .

Pope Francis wasted no time injecting politics into his visit to the White House on Wednesday , opening hisremarkswith a pointed reminder that the United States has a historical commitment to welcoming immigrants and following it with an exhortation to halt climate change .
`` As the son of an immigrant family , I am happy to be a guest in this country , which was largely built by such families , '' the pope said before President Barack Obama and an eager crowd of 11,000 on the South Lawn . He added later : `` I find it encouraging that you are proposing an initiative for reducing air pollution . Accepting the urgency , it seems clear to me also that climate change is a problem which can no longer be left to a future generation . ''
The pope 's comments came ahead of his much-anticipated speech on Thursday to Congress , where Republicans have resisted climate change legislation as well as efforts to reform the immigration system . At least one GOP lawmaker has promised to skip the pope 's speech because of his advocacy on the climate change issue , while Sen. Bernie Sanders , who has been surging in the Democratic presidential primary race , on WednesdayhailedFrancis ' `` very , very progressive agenda . ''
Still , the Argentine-born 78-year-old pontiff , who is on his first-ever visit to the United States , did n't come across as entirely in sync with Obama and Democratic priorities . One of the first issues he raised during his public remarks was the importance of protecting religious liberty , a hot topic in the United States in the wake of the jailing of a Kentucky clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to gay couples .
Francis , speaking slowly in English , a language he 's not that comfortable with , did n't specify any particular aspect of the religious liberty debate in the U.S . However , he appeared to be nodding toward the struggle between the church and the White House over provisions in the health reform law that required insurance coverage of birth control , which U.S. bishops have strongly resisted .
Even as he insisted that American Catholics are `` committed to building a society which is truly tolerant and inclusive , '' Francis also said , “ With countless other people of good will , they are likewise concerned that efforts to build a just and wisely ordered society respect their deepest concerns and their right to religious liberty . ”
The president also spoke about religious freedom , but with a more global view .
“ Here in the United States , we cherish religious liberty , ” Obama said . “ Yet around the world at this very moment , children of God , including Christians , are targeted and even killed because of their faith . Believers are prevented from gathering at their places of worship . The faithful are imprisoned . Churches are destroyed . So we stand with you in defense of religious freedom and interfaith dialogue , knowing that people everywhere must be able to live out their faith free from fear and intimidation . ”
Francis was met at the White House with the type of pomp reserved for only the most special of visitors . Vatican and U.S. flags were raised along the streets , while a red , white and blue draped stage was set for a welcoming ceremony which was largely secular , with bands playing the national anthems of the United States and the Holy See , which is a nation as well as the seat of the Roman Catholic church .
The lines to see Francis started forming along the carefully blocked off streets around the White House well before 4 a.m . Many of the spectators were dressed in their finest and carried small U.S. and Vatican flags ; one woman wore a tarp-like cape bearing a picture of the smiling pontiff .
The crowd included many people of Hispanic descent anxious to see the first Latin American pope , and any reference he made to immigrants or Latin America drew huge cheers . Many also applauded when the pope spoke about climate change and the environment . At one point , he referenced Martin Luther King Jr. in saying that when it comes to the planet , a gift of God , `` we have defaulted on a promissory note and now is the time to honor it . ''

Pope Francis wasted no time injecting politics into his visit to the White House on Wednesday, opening hisremarkswith a pointed reminder that the United States has a historical commitment to welcoming immigrants and following it with an exhortation to halt climate change.

""As the son of an immigrant family, I am happy to be a guest in this country, which was largely built by such families,'' the pope said before President Barack Obama and an eager crowd of 11,000 on the South Lawn. He added later: ""I find it encouraging that you are proposing an initiative for reducing air pollution. Accepting the urgency, it seems clear to me also that climate change is a problem which can no longer be left to a future generation.''

The pope's comments came ahead of his much-anticipated speech on Thursday to Congress, where Republicans have resisted climate change legislation as well as efforts to reform the immigration system. At least one GOP lawmaker has promised to skip the pope's speech because of his advocacy on the climate change issue, while Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has been surging in the Democratic presidential primary race, on WednesdayhailedFrancis' ""very, very progressive agenda.""

Still, the Argentine-born 78-year-old pontiff, who is on his first-ever visit to the United States, didn't come across as entirely in sync with Obama and Democratic priorities. One of the first issues he raised during his public remarks was the importance of protecting religious liberty, a hot topic in the United States in the wake of the jailing of a Kentucky clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to gay couples.

Francis, speaking slowly in English, a language he's not that comfortable with, didn't specify any particular aspect of the religious liberty debate in the U.S. However, he appeared to be nodding toward the struggle between the church and the White House over provisions in the health reform law that required insurance coverage of birth control, which U.S. bishops have strongly resisted.

Even as he insisted that American Catholics are ""committed to building a society which is truly tolerant and inclusive,'' Francis also said, “With countless other people of good will, they are likewise concerned that efforts to build a just and wisely ordered society respect their deepest concerns and their right to religious liberty.”

The president also spoke about religious freedom, but with a more global view.

“Here in the United States, we cherish religious liberty,” Obama said. “Yet around the world at this very moment, children of God, including Christians, are targeted and even killed because of their faith. Believers are prevented from gathering at their places of worship. The faithful are imprisoned. Churches are destroyed. So we stand with you in defense of religious freedom and interfaith dialogue, knowing that people everywhere must be able to live out their faith free from fear and intimidation.”

Francis was met at the White House with the type of pomp reserved for only the most special of visitors. Vatican and U.S. flags were raised along the streets, while a red, white and blue draped stage was set for a welcoming ceremony which was largely secular, with bands playing the national anthems of the United States and the Holy See, which is a nation as well as the seat of the Roman Catholic church.

The lines to see Francis started forming along the carefully blocked off streets around the White House well before 4 a.m. Many of the spectators were dressed in their finest and carried small U.S. and Vatican flags; one woman wore a tarp-like cape bearing a picture of the smiling pontiff.

The crowd included many people of Hispanic descent anxious to see the first Latin American pope, and any reference he made to immigrants or Latin America drew huge cheers. Many also applauded when the pope spoke about climate change and the environment. At one point, he referenced Martin Luther King Jr. in saying that when it comes to the planet, a gift of God, ""we have defaulted on a promissory note and now is the time to honor it.""

Obama’s welcoming statement was laced with references to God and faith, and he praised the pontiff as ""a living example of Jesus' teachings” because of his humility, embrace of simplicity and generosity. Obama also thanked Francis for helping broker the recent rapprochement between the U.S. and Cuba and for his public statements against war, in favor of helping refugees, and in favor of tackling climate change.

“You remind us that in the eyes of God our measure as individuals, and as societies, is not determined by wealth or power or station or celebrity, but by how well we hew to Scripture’s call to lift up the poor and the marginalized, to stand up for justice and against inequality, and to ensure that every human being is able to live in dignity — because we are all made in the image of God,” Obama said.

For more than a century, popes have made nuanced criticisms of the free-market capitalism that drives the American dream. But Pope Francis, with an unprecedented vigor, is locking horns with much that Washington and Wall Street hold dear. Why does he take such a hard line?

In the two-plus years since his election, he has enchanted and bewildered the world in equal measure with his compassion and his contradictions. But he has also proved himself a wily and sophisticated politician. Understanding this side of Francis—capable of crafty maneuvering, unafraid of confrontation, ready to seek out unlikely allies—is essential for understanding the complicated effect he is having on American politics.

The pope born in Argentina as Jorge Mario Bergoglio has been called both a Marxist and a reactionary. But unpack the long biography of this 78-year-old cleric, and a more complex and intriguing reality emerges. Francis has never embraced one particular political ideology, though he has been comfortable around people who have. His first boss, the woman who ran the Buenos Aires chemistry laboratory where he worked, was a Communist whose diligence and integrity he greatly admired. “Marxist ideology is wrong,” the pope said in 2013, “but in my life I have known many Marxists who are good people, so I don’t feel offended.”

What has shaped Francis, instead, is his lived experience. Born into an Italian immigrant family, he has a long-standing bias toward the underdog and those who must struggle to survive. The most formative part of his priestly life was the 19 years he spent among the very poorest in the shantytowns of Buenos Aires, where he was known as the “bishop of the slums.”

But there is another key to understanding the pope’s worldview. His predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, was above all a theologian. Pope John Paul II, before that, was originally an actor and a philosopher. But Francis trained as a scientist. One of his adages is: “Facts are more important than ideas.” The intersection of these two threads in Francis’ life—his sympathy for the poor and his insistence that reality comes before theory—help account for how the United States and its unrestrained capitalism have come into the papal crosshairs.

It’s not Marxism. ... It’s classic Catholic social teaching, as developed by previous popes.”



In July, Pope Francis delivered his fiercest condemnation of contemporary capitalism to date, addressing an assembly of political and community activists in Bolivia. Behind global capital’s indifference to the poor and the planet and all the “pain, death and destruction” it brings, he said, there lies “the stench of what Basil of Caesarea—one of the church’s first theologians—called ‘the dung of the devil.’ An unfettered pursuit of money rules. The service of the common good is left behind.” In this “subtle dictatorship,” capital has become an idol. In response, Francis called for change—“real change, structural change”—using the word no fewer than 32 times. Land, lodging and labor were “sacred rights,” and working for their “just distribution” was a “moral obligation” and, for Christians, a “commandment.”

Such talk has had an immediate impact in American politics. The AFL-CIO’s policy director Damon Silvers, who is not a Catholic, said: “I couldn’t recall any leader of any religion in my lifetime speaking so plainly about economic justice and how that is at the core of how we human beings are supposed to treat each other.” At the other end of the political spectrum, Fox News’ Greg Gutfeld, a former altar boy, labeled the pope “the most dangerous man on the planet.” Big Catholic donors like American billionaire Ken Langone, working to raise $180 million for the restoration of St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New York, have been so upset by the pope’s unvarying pronouncements that they warned cardinals that wealthy Catholics might stop giving to the church. The pope’s aversion to red-blooded capitalism is just too apocalyptic for America’s tycoons—overlooking the curative powers of technology, ignoring the way the free market had lifted millions from poverty and refusing to consider that Catholic teaching on contraception is partly to blame for our overcrowded planet.

Yet Francis’ supporters argue that he is not advocating a specific political program; rather than taking political sides, he is trying to open people’s minds to the generosity, openness and inclusiveness of the gospel. “It’s not Marxism,” one cardinal told me. “It’s classic Catholic social teaching, as developed by previous popes.” What, after all, is Francis’ joyful embrace of the poor and the rejected—kissing a man with a terrible skin disease, visiting thousands of African migrants washed up on Europe’s shores in Lampedusa, Italy—but an echo of Jesus of Nazareth?

(CNN) -- Liberal American Catholics greet almost anything uttered by Pope Francis with glee, but his latest pronouncement has them scratching their heads. Headlines proclaiming ""Pope says evolution, Big Bang are real"" could have been written in 1950.

That's when Pope Pius XII announced that Catholic doctrine and evolution could be compatible, an attitude endorsed--and even expanded upon--by Pope John Paul II, who said evolution is ""more than a hypothesis"" and ""effectively proven fact."" Pope Francis is just following in those footsteps.

""God is not a divine being or a magician, but the creator who brought everything to life,"" the Pope said Monday in an address to a gathering on ""Evolving Concepts of Nature,"" hosted by the Pontifical Academy of Sciences. ""Evolution in nature is not inconsistent with the notion of creation, because evolution requires the creation of things that evolve.""

So why all the headlines? Three reasons, I believe.

First, some saw Pope Francis' predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, as backtracking on openness to evolution, preferring instead the concept of ""intelligent design,"" which accepts some aspects of evolution but not others (such as its being undirected).

Francis' words, then, indicate that the church is back on track with its openness toward evolutionary theory.

Secondly, Francis is newsworthy, plain and simple. The ""church-has-new-open-leader"" narrative has taken hold, and anything he says is presented as groundbreaking -- even if previous, more traditional, popes said it before he did.

In the same vein, much of the media cling to the image of the church as anti-science. It's not all their fault, what with the church's opposition to artificial birth control, assisted reproduction, stem cell research and other medical procedures accepted by a majority of Americans, even a majority of American Catholics. That the whole Galileo thing is still baggage, some 400 years later, seems unfair, though.

The truth is that the first person to propose what would become the ""Big Bang Theory"" was a Catholic priest, Msgr. Georges Lemaître, a Belgian astronomer and professor of physics, who was never persecuted by the church for his ideas.

Which brings me to the third, and most likely reason for the hoopla around Francis' words about evolution. Because too many traditionalist Catholics have aligned themselves with Protestant evangelicals for political purposes, some of those evangelical beliefs and teachings have rubbed off on them.

While they may come together over opposition to abortion or same-sex marriage, these Catholics may find themselves joining other ""conservative"" causes, such as opposing immigration, programs for the poor and, yes, evolution in textbooks--all things Catholic teaching currently support.

It's been said that conservatives from various religious traditions often have more in common with other conservatives than they do with liberals from their own religious tradition. (Of course, the same is said about liberals.) While the number of Catholics joining ranks with evangelicals on issues such as opposing evolution is small, the two groups have become conflated in the perception of many.

On the way home from religious education class a few weeks ago, my son and I were discussing the creation story. ""It's just a myth,"" he announced, repeating my previous explanation that while the Bible stories contain truth, they didn't all necessarily happen.

If a 7-year-old can get it, it seems others can, too.

But in his first appearance Thursday at the National Prayer Breakfast , President Trump reaffirmed that he will be a strong advocate for the priorities of conservative Christians – a key part of his political base .
The first days of Trump ’ s presidency have been marked by a series of actions demonstrating that commitment . And on Thursday , he added another : a pledge to overturn a law that forbids political speech by tax-exempt churches .
“ I will get rid of and totally destroy the Johnson Amendment , and allow our representatives of faith to speak freely and without fear of retribution , ” Trump said , referring to a 1954 measure that bars churches from endorsing and opposing political candidates . Congress would have to approve a repeal .
Trump had made such a pledge during the campaign , but his reference Thursday added new urgency to that goal . And it builds on an already-robust record of advocacy for the priorities of religious conservatives :
• The Supreme Court nomination of Neil Gorsuch , a strong social conservative . Judge Gorsuch has never ruled in an abortion case , but he has sided with religious conservatives in key cases and wrote a book opposing physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia .
• The appearance by Trump ’ s vice president , Mike Pence , and a top adviser , Kellyanne Conway , at last week ’ s annual antiabortion march . Vice President Pence was the highest-level government official ever to appear in person at the March for Life .
• The reinstatement , by executive order , of a US government ban on funding for international groups that provide abortion counseling .
• Agreement , in a TV interview , that “ persecuted Christians ” would be given priority as refugees .
Trump is also reportedly considering an executive order titled “ Establishing a Government-Wide Initiative to Respect Religious Freedom. ” Such a move would reassure religious conservatives , though critics say it could curtail the rights of gay , lesbian , bisexual , and transgender people .
“ Evangelicals are particularly important to Trump , ” says John Green , an expert on religion and politics at the University of Akron in Ohio . “ On two issues – abortion and the Supreme Court – he made some pretty strong promises during the campaign , and at least so far he has kept them . ”
The irony is lost on no one . Trump ’ s personal background – a thrice-married , casino-owning billionaire who at times has spoken of women in crude terms – does not suggest a pious man . Trump himself referred to his past at the Republican National Convention last summer . He thanked “ the evangelical and religious community ” for its support on his way to the GOP nomination , then added : “ I ’ m not sure I totally deserve it . ”
As a crucial part of the Republican coalition , white evangelicals delivered for Trump on Election Day . They made up between 35 and 40 percent of the Republican vote , according to exit polls . All told , Trump won 80 percent of the white evangelical vote – the highest percentage for a Republican presidential nominee since 2004 .
“ During the campaign some polls seemed to show there would be a falloff in the [ evangelical ] vote for Trump , ” says James Guth , an expert on religion and politics at Furman University in Greenville , S.C. “ But when it came to Election Day , they fell in line . ”
Dislike of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton , and her strong support for abortion and gay rights , also helped . But evangelical voters could have just stayed home . What proved to be pivotal , says Professor Guth , is the Supreme Court seat left vacant by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia and Senate Republicans ’ unwillingness to consider President Obama ’ s nominee , Merrick Garland .
“ My evangelical friends , that ’ s what sealed the deal for a lot of them , ” Guth says . “ They were very disturbed by Trump , but then they thought about that Supreme Court seat . ”
Evangelical leaders were divided over Trump during the campaign , with some strongly supporting him and others in the “ never Trump ” camp . The never-Trumpers are still worth watching , says Guth , “ because if Trump undertakes policies that run against the evangelical grain , there will be a group of evangelical leaders willing and ready to criticize him . And that might turn some opinion around in the long run . ”
But for now , Trump is staying close to his religious base of support . One of the first interviews of his presidency went to the Christian Broadcasting Network , in which he said that , as president , he relies on God more than ever .
“ I would say that the office is so powerful that you need God even more , ” Trump told The Brody File last Friday . “ There ’ s almost not a decision that you make when you ’ re sitting in this position that isn ’ t a really life-altering position . So God comes in even more so . ”
At Thursday ’ s prayer breakfast , Trump spoke of how the prayers of Americans have sustained and inspired him .
“ What I hear most often as I travel the country are five words that never , ever fail to touch my heart . That 's , ‘ I am praying for you , ’ `` Trump said .
Trump is a professed Presbyterian , and was raised in that faith , with his Scottish-immigrant mother as his primary influence . On Thursday , he mentioned being sworn in on the Bible from which his mother taught him and his siblings as young children .
But his religious upbringing also included attendance , as a teenager , at Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan , where the Rev . Norman Vincent Peale preached “ the power of positive thinking. ” Dr. Peale had two identities – one as a motivational speaker , the other as a traditional preacher , the Rev . Michael Brown , senior minister of Marble Collegiate , tells CNN .
`` Out there in civic centers he would say , over and over , 'You can , if you think you can , ' `` Reverend Brown says . `` In the pulpit of our church he would quote Philippians 4 , 'You can do all things through Christ . ' ``
Trump biographers point to Peale ’ s “ positive thinking ” philosophy as central to Trump ’ s drive as a businessman .
But for many conservative evangelicals , happy to have a receptive audience in the White House after eight years of Mr. Obama , Trump ’ s religious back story matters less than his actions today . And for those with doubts , the presence of Pence in the White House is reassuring . Pence calls himself “ a Christian , a conservative , and a Republican – in that order . ”
“ Pence is a poster child for evangelical conservative politics , and has been for a long time , ” says Guth . “ His presence [ on the ticket ] reassured a lot of people . ”
One issue of concern to Christian conservatives , gay rights , may be one in which Trump isn ’ t prepared to go all in . After recent reports that Trump was ready to rescind an Obama order granting workplace protections for federal LGBT employees , the White House put out a statement saying those protections would remain .
The statement added that “ the president is proud to have been the first ever GOP nominee to mention the LGBTQ community in his nomination acceptance speech . ”
Professor Green says that Christian conservatives are likely to approach this issue pragmatically . “ They have fairly low expectations of what they expect from the political leaders they support , ” he says .

In addition , young evangelicals are increasingly comfortable with the concept of same-sex marriage and other gay rights in a way that they are not with abortion .
But none of this means that Trump will not eventually enact a measure to promote religious freedom in a way that is seen as hostile to gays and lesbians . The proposed draft order on religious freedom could allow companies that do business with the federal government to decline to work with gay and lesbian couples on adoptions and other services , according to ABC News .","Donald Trump has never been known primarily as a man of faith.

Evangelical leaders were divided over Trump during the campaign, with some strongly supporting him and others in the “never Trump” camp. The never-Trumpers are still worth watching, says Guth, “because if Trump undertakes policies that run against the evangelical grain, there will be a group of evangelical leaders willing and ready to criticize him. And that might turn some opinion around in the long run.”

Need for faith

But for now, Trump is staying close to his religious base of support. One of the first interviews of his presidency went to the Christian Broadcasting Network, in which he said that, as president, he relies on God more than ever.

“I would say that the office is so powerful that you need God even more,” Trump told The Brody File last Friday. “There’s almost not a decision that you make when you’re sitting in this position that isn’t a really life-altering position. So God comes in even more so.”

At Thursday’s prayer breakfast, Trump spoke of how the prayers of Americans have sustained and inspired him.

“What I hear most often as I travel the country are five words that never, ever fail to touch my heart. That's, ‘I am praying for you,’ "" Trump said.

Trump is a professed Presbyterian, and was raised in that faith, with his Scottish-immigrant mother as his primary influence. On Thursday, he mentioned being sworn in on the Bible from which his mother taught him and his siblings as young children.

But his religious upbringing also included attendance, as a teenager, at Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan, where the Rev. Norman Vincent Peale preached “the power of positive thinking.” Dr. Peale had two identities – one as a motivational speaker, the other as a traditional preacher, the Rev. Michael Brown, senior minister of Marble Collegiate, tells CNN.

""Out there in civic centers he would say, over and over, 'You can, if you think you can,' "" Reverend Brown says. ""In the pulpit of our church he would quote Philippians 4, 'You can do all things through Christ.' ""

Trump biographers point to Peale’s “positive thinking” philosophy as central to Trump’s drive as a businessman.

The Pence factor

But for many conservative evangelicals, happy to have a receptive audience in the White House after eight years of Mr. Obama, Trump’s religious back story matters less than his actions today. And for those with doubts, the presence of Pence in the White House is reassuring. Pence calls himself “a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican – in that order.”

“Pence is a poster child for evangelical conservative politics, and has been for a long time,” says Guth. “His presence [on the ticket] reassured a lot of people.”

One issue of concern to Christian conservatives, gay rights, may be one in which Trump isn’t prepared to go all in. After recent reports that Trump was ready to rescind an Obama order granting workplace protections for federal LGBT employees, the White House put out a statement saying those protections would remain.

The statement added that “the president is proud to have been the first ever GOP nominee to mention the LGBTQ community in his nomination acceptance speech.”

Professor Green says that Christian conservatives are likely to approach this issue pragmatically. “They have fairly low expectations of what they expect from the political leaders they support,” he says.

In addition, young evangelicals are increasingly comfortable with the concept of same-sex marriage and other gay rights in a way that they are not with abortion.

But none of this means that Trump will not eventually enact a measure to promote religious freedom in a way that is seen as hostile to gays and lesbians. The proposed draft order on religious freedom could allow companies that do business with the federal government to decline to work with gay and lesbian couples on adoptions and other services, according to ABC News.",www.csmonitor.com,center,Xj8EYYpClxWGsN0B

People from around the world gathered in Washington, DC, Thursday morning for the 66th annual National Prayer Breakfast.

More than 3,500 attendees were at the Washington Hilton for the event – among them, President Donald Trump and members of Congress.

Watch the full National Prayer Breakfast below:

The president stressed the importance of religious freedom and reminded those present that America is one nation under God.

""Our rights are not given to us by man. Our rights come from our Creator. No matter what, no earthly force can take those rights away,"" Trump told the audience.

""When Americans are able to live by their convictions, to speak openly of their faith and to teach their children what is right, our families thrive, our communities flourish, and our nation can achieve anything at all,"" he said.

The president also pointed to God's hand at work in the world today.

Congressman Steve Scalise (R-LA), who narrowly survived being shot last year at a congressional baseball event, also spoke at the breakfast event. Scalise has publicly praised God for helping him survive the shooting, saying previously, ""I am definitely a living example that miracles really do happen.""

During his prayer breakfast speech, Scalise again pointed to God over and over again, in his own story of survival as well as in references to American government.

""This was a nation founded with a deep belief in God,"" Scalise said, pointing to the way the Founding Fathers talked about faith and God as they were establishing a new nation.

""You can't separate church from state,"" Scalise continued. ""This idea that you could just check your faith at the door... faith is part of who you are, it's part of who I am.""

Rep. Randy Hultgren, co-chair of the 2018 National Prayer Breakfast, explained to CBN's John Jessup the significance of the annual event and how it impacted his own faith in Jesus Christ. Watch below:

In an interview with French newspaper La Croix , Pope Francis strongly implied that the terrorists who attacked Paris and Brussels did so because they “ grew up in a ghetto . ”
He also applauded the election of Muslim mayor of London , Sadiq Khan , stating it “ illustrates the need for Europe to rediscover its capacity to integrate , ” evoking “ Pope Gregory the Great , who negotiated with the people known as barbarians who were subsequently integrated . ”
However , the situation of mass Muslim migration that Europe now faces is distinctly different : the “ barbarians ” ( the term referring in this case to Franks , Lombards and Visigoths ) were Europeans , and did not follow a religion which historically , violently , conquered dozens of countries and preached supremacy .
Even today , the Muslim country Indonesia is currently committing what has been widely described as a genocide against Christian West Papuans with mass migration , violence and the banning of Papuan nationalism .
Pope Francis also claimed Europe ’ s declining birth rate is a “ grave problem ” that makes mass Muslim migration “ necessary. ” He described this “ demographic emptiness ” as a result of “ a selfish search for well-being . ”
The Pope stated that Muslims and Christians need to learn to live peacefully together , citing Lebanon as a good example of this . Though Lebanon is perhaps not the best illustration for the Pontiff to draw upon .
Lebanon was a majority Christian country up until the 1960s . In the 1970s , after an influx of Muslim refugees , tens of thousands of Christians were ethnically cleansed from the country .
Since 2005 there have been as many as 14 terrorist attacks a year in Lebanon , and the UK government ’ s travel advice on Lebanon advises against traveling to certain parts of the country as there is a “ high threat from terrorism . ”

Polls show the vast majority of people in Islamic countries , apart from Saudi Arabia and Pakistan , widely disapprove of the garment .
Suggesting that the fear of migration in Europe is partly based on a fear of Islam , Pope Francis was asked whether he felt that such fears are justified . He said he didn ’ t think that “ there is a fear of Islam as such but of [ Islamic State ] and its war of conquest , which is partly drawn from Islam . ”

Her right to religious liberty has been grossly violated,2015-09-08,"Mike Huckabee, On Tbn.","Today , September 8 , I am holding a prayer vigil and rally for liberty in Grayson , Kentucky . I will call on Judge David Bunning to release Kim Davis on the grounds that her right to religious liberty has been grossly violated under the Constitution of these United States of America .
When I warned that the Supreme Court ’ s decision on marriage would lead to the criminalization of Christianity in America I was dismissed by many as an alarmist and my comments were mocked by the chattering class . Now , just two months after the court 's lawless ruling , an elected county clerk has been put in jail by an unelected judge for refusing to issue a “ marriage '' license to a same-sex couple , removing all doubts about criminalization of Christianity in this country .
When the people of Kentucky elected Democrat Kim Davis as county clerk , the state ’ s constitution affirmed that marriage is between one man and one woman . The amendment passed with 75 percent of the people ’ s vote .
Today , I ask on behalf of Kim : “ Under what law is she authorized to issue homosexual couples a marriage license ? ” Can you site the specific right in the Constitution ? Is there a statute , passed by Congress that actually says that the five unelected lawyers in the majority of the court ’ s opinion were right to throw out the very definition of marriage and make up one on their own ?
Today , I ask on behalf of Kim : “ Under what law is she authorized to issue homosexual couples a marriage license ? ” Can you site the specific right in the Constitution ?
In the Obergefell decision , the Supreme Court ruled same-sex couples have the right to get married . Whether you personally agree with that or not does n't matter in Kim ’ s case . What does matter , is that the Supreme Court can not and did not make a law . It only made a ruling on a law .
Kim 's stand for religious liberty is a pivotal moment in our nation 's history . Will we continue to pretend as though the Supreme Court is the `` Supreme Branch '' with the authority and ability to make laws ? It most certainly is not . The Supreme Court is one of three co-equal branches of government under our Constitution . It is no more the `` Supreme Branch '' than it is the `` Supreme Being '' with the authority to redefine the laws of nature or of nature 's God !
What we know for sure is that The Judicial Branch is constitutionally prohibited from writing laws , there are religious liberty protections in the Kentucky constitution and Kentucky statute and the plaintiffs in the case did not seek Kim ’ s incarceration . Despite these facts , Kim Davis was thrown in jail for contempt , which means she was given no possibility of bail .
That seems even more ludicrous when you consider many of the America 's most evil and notorious serial killers , murderers , rapists , mafia bosses and presidential assassins were actually let out on bail :
? John A. Gotti : Son of Gambino crime family leader
All of these dangerous criminals were given bail . A Democrat county clerk in Kentucky who is a Christian was not .
No one went to jail when San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom ordered city clerks to issue same-sex marriage licenses in direct disobedience to California law . More recently , No one went to jail when San Francisco was set up as a sanctuary city – sheltering dangerous illegal immigrant felons in defiance of federal law . Not only did Newsom NOT go to jail , he ’ s now the lieutenant governor of the state !
I am appalled at our government ’ s willingness to accommodate the religious beliefs of all religions , but Christianity .
When I traveled to Guantanamo Bay , I was amazed by how well we treated foreign Muslim terrorist detainees . The U.S. government provides prayer mats and special meals that conform to Islamic restrictions , but we can ’ t accommodate the religious beliefs of a popularly elected Christian county clerk in Kentucky ? We have lost our moral compass as a country when our government accommodates militant Muslims but not conservative Christians .
As a governor for ten and a half years , I followed the Constitution of my state and of the United States . The rule of law is a foundation of our democracy .
But the reason why our laws are respected by the American people is because our Constitution guarantees reasonable safeguards to protect the rights of dissenters .
I refuse to sit silently as our Constitution is torched and the courts violate our fundamental rights . We did not fight a revolution against the tyranny of one unelected monarch so we could surrender our freedoms and abandon our Constitution to the tyranny of five unaccountable , unelected lawyers .
This shredding of the most fundamental civil rights of our citizens can not stand . I will fight for , and protect , the religious liberty of every American .

religion_and_faith,Guest Writer - Right,2,https://townhall.com/columnists/michaelbrown/2017/07/01/draft-n2349016,Don’t Sell Your Soul in Defense of President Trump,2017-07-01,"Michael Brown, Matt Vespa, Bronson Stocking, ""Cortney OBrien"", Timothy Meads, Julio Rosas","The opinions expressed by columnists are their own and do not represent the views of Townhall.com .
I ’ m all for defending our president when he ’ s the subject of unjust attacks . And as a follower of Jesus , I voted for him , despite my misgivings . I ’ m also very happy to point out the many good things he has already done as president . But I will not sacrifice my ethics and demean my faith to defend his wrongful words . To do that is to lose all credibility before a watching world .
Plenty of Christians and non-Christians had a hard time understanding how so many of us evangelicals could vote for a candidate who seemed to be so thoroughly un-evangelical . But when we explained that we were voting against Hillary , that Supreme Court appointees were important to us , and that Trump seemed to care about religious liberties , many of them understood our vote . They see we ’ re not whitewashing him or denying his faults . Some dissenters can even respect our choice .
But when we find it necessary to defend his every word , we discredit ourselves and tarnish our witness .
What prompted me to pen this article was the recent series of Trump tweets regarding MSNBC ’ s Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski . The president wrote :
Really now , for the most powerful elected official on the planet to call liberal newscasters “ Psycho Joe ” and “ low I.Q . Crazy Mika ” is indefensible . ( Let ’ s not even discuss the “ bleeding ” reference and where that leads . ) And to defend him – I mean for us to defend him as Christian conservatives – is even less defensible .
We can be loyal to the president and still be ashamed of such language . We can support him and still say , “ Mr . President , you demean yourself with such behavior , and you ’ ll never get the respect you desire if you sink so low. ” In fact , that ’ s what real loyalty and support looks like .
But when we find it necessary to stand up for him , as if he ’ s the weak little victim being attacked by these terrible giants , we also demean ourselves . And what if it was your son or daughter or spouse or parent that the president was attacking with such language ? How would you feel ? When he does this , he ultimately hurts himself .
One man responded to my tweet saying , “ This perfect Savior had a very blue collar flavor which we try to scrub away with our sensibilities . Newscasters need accountability too . ”
First , no one is denying that newscasters need accountability , and there are a slew of conservative newscasters blasting the liberals day and night ( and vice versa ) . Second , and more importantly , it is ridiculous and almost obscene to compare our perfect Savior ’ s rebukes of sinners with the president calling TV journalists Psycho and Crazy .
But this man who tweeted to me was not the only one to make the Trump-Jesus comparison . At least two ministers defended Trump on my Twitter account , with one also comparing Trump ’ s words to those of Jesus and Paul . ( I ’ m just referencing them here rather than posting their tweets here ; perhaps they ’ ve had a change of heart . You know things are really bad when ministers of the gospel compare Trump ’ s words to those of Jesus . )
One Christian woman was indignant with me : “ You 've gone too far ! You Sir , are not God Almighty and do not speak for Him ! ”
I ’ ve gone too far by saying we ought not defend the president ’ s childlike words ?

I’m all for defending our president when he’s the subject of unjust attacks. And as a follower of Jesus, I voted for him, despite my misgivings. I’m also very happy to point out the many good things he has already done as president. But I will not sacrifice my ethics and demean my faith to defend his wrongful words. To do that is to lose all credibility before a watching world.

Plenty of Christians and non-Christians had a hard time understanding how so many of us evangelicals could vote for a candidate who seemed to be so thoroughly un-evangelical. But when we explained that we were voting against Hillary, that Supreme Court appointees were important to us, and that Trump seemed to care about religious liberties, many of them understood our vote. They see we’re not whitewashing him or denying his faults. Some dissenters can even respect our choice.

But when we find it necessary to defend his every word, we discredit ourselves and tarnish our witness.

What prompted me to pen this article was the recent series of Trump tweets regarding MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski. The president wrote:

In response to this, I tweeted:

Really now, for the most powerful elected official on the planet to call liberal newscasters “Psycho Joe” and “low I.Q. Crazy Mika” is indefensible. (Let’s not even discuss the “bleeding” reference and where that leads.) And to defend him – I mean for us to defend him as Christian conservatives – is even less defensible.

We can be loyal to the president and still be ashamed of such language. We can support him and still say, “Mr. President, you demean yourself with such behavior, and you’ll never get the respect you desire if you sink so low.” In fact, that’s what real loyalty and support looks like.

But when we find it necessary to stand up for him, as if he’s the weak little victim being attacked by these terrible giants, we also demean ourselves. And what if it was your son or daughter or spouse or parent that the president was attacking with such language? How would you feel? When he does this, he ultimately hurts himself.

One man responded to my tweet saying, “This perfect Savior had a very blue collar flavor which we try to scrub away with our sensibilities. Newscasters need accountability too.”

First, no one is denying that newscasters need accountability, and there are a slew of conservative newscasters blasting the liberals day and night (and vice versa). Second, and more importantly, it is ridiculous and almost obscene to compare our perfect Savior’s rebukes of sinners with the president calling TV journalists Psycho and Crazy.

But this man who tweeted to me was not the only one to make the Trump-Jesus comparison. At least two ministers defended Trump on my Twitter account, with one also comparing Trump’s words to those of Jesus and Paul. (I’m just referencing them here rather than posting their tweets here; perhaps they’ve had a change of heart. You know things are really bad when ministers of the gospel compare Trump’s words to those of Jesus.)

One Christian woman was indignant with me: “You've gone too far! You Sir, are not God Almighty and do not speak for Him!”

I’ve gone too far by saying we ought not defend the president’s childlike words? I’ve gone too far in suggesting that the president would do well to read what Proverbs says about the conduct of kings? (I tweeted out the Proverbs reference during the interaction.) I’ve gone too far in saying that we, as followers of Jesus, should find these tweets embarrassing?

Another wrote, “No need to be ashamed, hope he keeps it up.” Yes, I hope that the president keeps disparaging people in the crudest, most immature manner. I’m cheering you on!

Still another added: “Christians don't look at the faults of a person just the answer to them. Not ashamed of a person who doesn't hide their emotions.”

I wonder what these Christians would be saying if Hillary Clinton were our president and she was the one ridiculing conservative newscasters in such crass terms?

Then there were those who felt sorry for Mr. Trump. They tweeted that the media is not fair to him and that he gets death threats all the time. Surely he has to protect himself!

Once again, such responses boggle the mind. He is the most protected man on the planet, and to my knowledge, these newscasters are not trying to kill him. And how, pray tell, is he defending himself by calling them ugly names? If they misrepresent him, he can set the record straight, but he need not throw mud in their faces. The mud he throws will only splatter back. And the best way to push back against his critics is to push forward with the agenda they hate.

But for us to defend his every tweet is to make ourselves into stooges more than supporters, helping no one in the end.

This week, Ann Coulter attacked Sean Hannity, writing, “Sean Hannity, bless his heart, has the zeal of the late Trump convert. He would endorse communism if Trump decided to implement the policies of ‘The Communist Manifesto.’ (Which the GOP's health care bill actually does!)”

I will leave that battle to them, but the reminder for us is that loyalty does not require blind allegiance.

On Wednesday, the Pope will hold his first public events in Washington.

Here are five things to watch on this historic day.

1. A political Pope

Francis has sharp political opinions on many of the most pressing issues facing the world today, from climate change to immigration and religious freedom.

The question is: How deeply will he delve into domestic U.S. politics?

The Pope is scheduled to make a short speech at the Rose Garden in the White House on Wednesday morning, and Vatican sources say we can expect him to outline the major themes of his five-day visit to the United States.

2. The Pope and the President

After the Rose Garden ceremony, Francis and President Barack Obama are expected to meet privately in the Oval Office.

There are many issues on which both men agree -- and they seem, personally, to get along well.

Pope Francis laughs alongside US President Barack Obama upon his arrival at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, September 22.

But there are also issues on which the Pope and President disagree, and it will be interesting to see the statements that emerge from the private meeting.

Watch, in particular, for references to religious freedom, a big area of contention between the U.S. Catholic bishops and the White House, who have battled over the contraception mandate in Obama's signature health care law.

3. Crowds, crowds and more crowds

By early Wednesday morning, crowds had already lined up along the route Pope Francis is expected to tour in his ""popemobile.""

4. A good scolding?

Catholic Church sources are keen to hear what Pope Francis will tell a big meeting of bishops Wednesday morning at St. Matthew's Cathedral in Washington.

The Catholic Church in the United States has been struggling in recent years, losing many members in part because of self-inflicted injuries like the clergy sex-abuse scandal.

Will Pope Francis give them a papal pep talk or take them to task?

5. A controversial saint

In his last planned event on Wednesday, Pope Francis will canonize Junipero Serra at a large Mass outside Washington's Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception.

The canonization is a huge point of pride for Latino Americans, and Serra, an 18th-century missionary from Spain, will be the first saint ever canonized on American soil. But to Native Americans, Serra was no saint. They say he came to conquer and convert their communities.",www.cnn.com,left,QxxAHITnijpYtYR9
religion_and_faith,Christian Science Monitor,1,http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2015/0705/Gay-marriage-ruling-leaves-debate-about-religious-liberty-wide-open,Gay marriage ruling leaves debate about religious liberty wide open,2015-07-05,Warren Richey,"Two blockbuster cases dominated the docket at the United States Supreme Court in its recently-concluded term – one stands as a civil rights landmark , the other is slipping into quiet obscurity .
In its 2014-15 term , the high court decided 74 cases , including rulings upholding the president ’ s power to determine US policy over the contested status of Jerusalem , permitting Texas to exclude the confederate flag from specialty license plates , and barring prosecutors from treating an undersized grouper as the legal equivalent of a shredded document .
But by far the term ’ s biggest decisions came in the court ’ s historic ruling for same-sex marriage and in a 6-to-3 vote upholding distribution of tax credits in President Obama ’ s health care reform law .
While the same-sex marriage decision will reverberate for years , the high court ’ s ruling in the Obamacare case has quickly fallen off the national radar now that the once-dire threat to millions of health insurance policies has subsided .
In contrast , Justice Anthony Kennedy ’ s decision in the same-sex marriage case is a transformative event . It marks the most significant civil rights decision by the high court in at least a generation – a kind of gay rights version of Brown v. Board of Education .
In his decision , Justice Kennedy established that the fundamental right to marry embraces all Americans – regardless of sexual orientation .
In the 5-to-4 ruling , the high court said that state bans on same-sex marriage violate due process and equal protection rights of the Fourteenth Amendment .
The decision effectively ends a rancorous state-by-state debate over marriage , and extends a welcoming hand to a segment of American society that has faced open hostility and discrimination .
As such , the marriage decision represents a huge victory for the lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender ( LGBT ) community , their friends , families , and other supporters .
“ This decision affirms what millions of Americans already believe in their hearts . When all Americans are treated as equal , we are all more free , ” President Obama said in comments shortly after the ruling .
But the case that sharply divided the court itself has also left the country sharply divided . Religious conservatives feel they are under siege and are looking for ways to fight back or protect themselves .
Recognizing this , Kennedy ’ s decision hints at matters beyond gay marriage and anticipates the next big high court showdown – a bitter national struggle pitting gay rights against religious liberty .
Analysts say Kennedy went out of his way in his decision to avoid labeling religious conservatives as bigots or motivated by animosity toward homosexuals . That posture is critical , they say , because it leaves open a way for the court in future cases to balance the competing interests of religious conservatives with the growing rights and clout of gay Americans .
“ Kennedy , I think , wants to keep the court ’ s options open to respect religious and traditional marriage libertarian rights to exclude or to discriminate , ” Yale Law Professor William Eskridge told a recent gathering of the American Constitution Society .
“ Justice Kennedy is loath to close off those options , ” he said .
Professor Eskridge noted that Kennedy provided the decisive fifth vote in a 2000 high court case that upheld the Boy Scouts ’ right to bar gay men from serving as scoutmasters . To the Boy Scouts , the decision affirmed their right to associate with like-minded individuals . To the rejected scoutmaster , the decision endorsed blatant anti-gay discrimination .
Washington Appellate Lawyer Gene Schaerr said in a Heritage Foundation briefing that Justice Kennedy went “ out of his way in numerous places in his opinion to try to suggest respect for the religious viewpoint on this issue . ”
“ Those of us who care about religious liberty can be grateful that Justice Kennedy ’ s opinion dodged some big bullets , ” Mr. Schaerr said . “ But the opinion , unintentionally I think , launched a number of grenades that are still in the air . ”
He noted that some religious organizations may soon face loss of their tax exempt status unless they jettison their opposition to same-sex marriage , and religious colleges may discover their accreditation is in jeopardy if they are found to discriminate against same-sex married couples in violation of constitutional rights .
In contrast to the historic same-sex marriage landmark with its ongoing repercussions , the high court challenge to President Obama ’ s health care reform law is fast on its way to being forgotten .
Had a majority of justices agreed with the plaintiffs that the Affordable Care Act barred the distribution of tax credits thorough federal health care exchanges set up in 34 states , that decision would have gutted the ACA and left millions of Americans unable to afford any health insurance .
Instead , the court essentially gave the Obama administration the benefit of the doubt over what the majority justices said were “ a few examples of inartful drafting . ”
Writing for the majority in the 6-to-3 decision , Chief Justice John Roberts said it would make no sense for Congress to create a law meant to advance universal health care by allowing tax subsidies only in health care exchanges established by a state – rather than also in exchanges set up by the federal government .
“ Congress passed the Affordable Care Act to improve health insurance markets , not to destroy them , ” Chief Justice Roberts wrote .
It marked the second time the chief justice had joined the high court ’ s liberal wing to save the ACA from its potential demise at the nation ’ s highest court . In June 2012 , Roberts joined with the court ’ s liberal wing to uphold the controversial measure after concluding that the law ’ s mandated insurance requirement amounted to a tax rather than a penalty .
The chief justice ’ s twin rescue operations prompted Justice Antonin Scalia to quip in a dissenting opinion that rather than calling the law Obamacare , it should be renamed SCOTUScare . ( SCOTUS is an acronym for Supreme Court of the United States . )
Beyond the two blockbusters , the court ’ s term produced several other notable decisions .
In an 8-to-1 decision , the court put employers on notice that they must recognize the need to accommodate religious practices of their workers or job applicants , even when a job applicant fails to request an accommodation .
In that case the court ruled for a Muslim teen who was rejected for a job at an Abercrombie Kids store because she wore a headscarf .
In its 10th year under Chief Justice Roberts , the court remains essentially a conservative body . But you wouldn ’ t know it from this year ’ s highest profile cases . Of the top 10 decisions of the term , analysts classify eight as liberal victories . Only two of the top 10 decisions are said to embrace a conservative approach .
This pendulum-like movement at the court between liberal and conservative rulings is due in large part to Justice Kennedy ’ s position at or near the center of the nine-member court .
He is , thus , frequently positioned to cast the fifth and deciding vote in controversial cases .
The chief justice has also occasionally swung over to join the liberal wing in high profile cases , as both he and Kennedy did in the Obamacare decision .
Despite that exception , Kennedy ’ s power to singlehandedly decide major cases was on full display this term .
He provided the deciding vote in a ruling that an independent commission formed in Arizona by ballot initiative did not violate the Constitution ’ s `` elections clause . ''
The decision is a major victory for election reform advocates . It upholds similar commissions in six other states and gives a green light to others looking for ways to reduce the involvement of partisan politics in drawing election districts .
Kennedy also swung over to join his liberal colleagues in a redistricting case in Alabama . In that case the court agreed to keep alive a challenge to a voting map drawn by the Republican-controlled state legislature . Minority groups charged the map illegally undercut black voting clout in the state .
Kennedy also played a key role in holding off an effort by the court ’ s conservatives to bar the use of so-called disparate impact discrimination claims under the Fair Housing Act .
The case marked the third time in recent years that the court ’ s conservatives had sought to take up a case to strike down the disparate impact approach under the FHA .
The disparate impact theory of discrimination permits lawsuits when a statistical analysis shows that minorities suffer disproportionate harm from a particular policy – even when that policy is racially neutral .
Instead of joining the conservatives , Kennedy sided with the liberal wing and wrote the majority opinion upholding disparate impact lawsuits under the FHA , but also seeking to impose limits on such suits when they might lead to racial quotas .
Apart from the string of liberal wins , the high court produced two conservative victories among the term ’ s top cases . Both were made possible by the swing vote of Kennedy .
In one , the court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency must take the cost of compliance into account when considering whether to regulate toxic air pollutants emitted from coal- and oil-fired power plants .
In the second conservative victory , the court upheld Oklahoma ’ s use of the drug midazolam as part of its three-drug lethal injection protocol despite the involvement of that same drug in three botched executions last year .
Again , with Kennedy ’ s support , the court said three Oklahoma death row inmates had failed to prove that the state ’ s use of midazolam presented an intolerable risk that the condemned prisoners would suffer severe pain during the execution process .
The case was important because capital punishment abolitionists have been working to dry up the availability of certain drugs used in lethal injections . The ruling will make it easier for states like Oklahoma to continue to use midazolam , and to continue carry out executions .
The case is also notable because two liberal justices , Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg , announced that they believe the time has come to declare the death penalty unconstitutional .
That announcement is expected to trigger a new round of litigation in death penalty cases with an eye toward bringing a dispute to the high court that might facilitate a decision striking down capital punishment throughout the US . As in most other high profile cases , the outcome in that one would likely , once again , come down to the vote of Justice Kennedy .","Two blockbuster cases dominated the docket at the United States Supreme Court in its recently-concluded term – one stands as a civil rights landmark, the other is slipping into quiet obscurity.

In its 2014-15 term, the high court decided 74 cases, including rulings upholding the president’s power to determine US policy over the contested status of Jerusalem, permitting Texas to exclude the confederate flag from specialty license plates, and barring prosecutors from treating an undersized grouper as the legal equivalent of a shredded document.

“This decision affirms what millions of Americans already believe in their hearts. When all Americans are treated as equal, we are all more free,” President Obama said in comments shortly after the ruling.

Kennedy's carefully worded decision

But the case that sharply divided the court itself has also left the country sharply divided. Religious conservatives feel they are under siege and are looking for ways to fight back or protect themselves.

Recognizing this, Kennedy’s decision hints at matters beyond gay marriage and anticipates the next big high court showdown – a bitter national struggle pitting gay rights against religious liberty.

He noted that some religious organizations may soon face loss of their tax exempt status unless they jettison their opposition to same-sex marriage, and religious colleges may discover their accreditation is in jeopardy if they are found to discriminate against same-sex married couples in violation of constitutional rights.

SCOTUScare?

In contrast to the historic same-sex marriage landmark with its ongoing repercussions, the high court challenge to President Obama’s health care reform law is fast on its way to being forgotten.

Had a majority of justices agreed with the plaintiffs that the Affordable Care Act barred the distribution of tax credits thorough federal health care exchanges set up in 34 states, that decision would have gutted the ACA and left millions of Americans unable to afford any health insurance.

But that’s not what happened.

Instead, the court essentially gave the Obama administration the benefit of the doubt over what the majority justices said were “a few examples of inartful drafting.”

Writing for the majority in the 6-to-3 decision, Chief Justice John Roberts said it would make no sense for Congress to create a law meant to advance universal health care by allowing tax subsidies only in health care exchanges established by a state – rather than also in exchanges set up by the federal government.

“Congress passed the Affordable Care Act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them,” Chief Justice Roberts wrote.

It marked the second time the chief justice had joined the high court’s liberal wing to save the ACA from its potential demise at the nation’s highest court. In June 2012, Roberts joined with the court’s liberal wing to uphold the controversial measure after concluding that the law’s mandated insurance requirement amounted to a tax rather than a penalty.

The chief justice’s twin rescue operations prompted Justice Antonin Scalia to quip in a dissenting opinion that rather than calling the law Obamacare, it should be renamed SCOTUScare. (SCOTUS is an acronym for Supreme Court of the United States.)

Beyond the two blockbusters, the court’s term produced several other notable decisions.

In an 8-to-1 decision, the court put employers on notice that they must recognize the need to accommodate religious practices of their workers or job applicants, even when a job applicant fails to request an accommodation.

In that case the court ruled for a Muslim teen who was rejected for a job at an Abercrombie Kids store because she wore a headscarf.

A conservative court's liberal swing

In its 10th year under Chief Justice Roberts, the court remains essentially a conservative body. But you wouldn’t know it from this year’s highest profile cases. Of the top 10 decisions of the term, analysts classify eight as liberal victories. Only two of the top 10 decisions are said to embrace a conservative approach.

This pendulum-like movement at the court between liberal and conservative rulings is due in large part to Justice Kennedy’s position at or near the center of the nine-member court.

He is, thus, frequently positioned to cast the fifth and deciding vote in controversial cases.

The chief justice has also occasionally swung over to join the liberal wing in high profile cases, as both he and Kennedy did in the Obamacare decision.

Despite that exception, Kennedy’s power to singlehandedly decide major cases was on full display this term.

He provided the deciding vote in a ruling that an independent commission formed in Arizona by ballot initiative did not violate the Constitution’s ""elections clause.""

The decision is a major victory for election reform advocates. It upholds similar commissions in six other states and gives a green light to others looking for ways to reduce the involvement of partisan politics in drawing election districts.

Kennedy also swung over to join his liberal colleagues in a redistricting case in Alabama. In that case the court agreed to keep alive a challenge to a voting map drawn by the Republican-controlled state legislature. Minority groups charged the map illegally undercut black voting clout in the state.

Kennedy also played a key role in holding off an effort by the court’s conservatives to bar the use of so-called disparate impact discrimination claims under the Fair Housing Act.

The case marked the third time in recent years that the court’s conservatives had sought to take up a case to strike down the disparate impact approach under the FHA.

The disparate impact theory of discrimination permits lawsuits when a statistical analysis shows that minorities suffer disproportionate harm from a particular policy – even when that policy is racially neutral.

Instead of joining the conservatives, Kennedy sided with the liberal wing and wrote the majority opinion upholding disparate impact lawsuits under the FHA, but also seeking to impose limits on such suits when they might lead to racial quotas.

Conservative victories

Apart from the string of liberal wins, the high court produced two conservative victories among the term’s top cases. Both were made possible by the swing vote of Kennedy.

In one, the court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency must take the cost of compliance into account when considering whether to regulate toxic air pollutants emitted from coal- and oil-fired power plants.

In the second conservative victory, the court upheld Oklahoma’s use of the drug midazolam as part of its three-drug lethal injection protocol despite the involvement of that same drug in three botched executions last year.

Again, with Kennedy’s support, the court said three Oklahoma death row inmates had failed to prove that the state’s use of midazolam presented an intolerable risk that the condemned prisoners would suffer severe pain during the execution process.

The case was important because capital punishment abolitionists have been working to dry up the availability of certain drugs used in lethal injections. The ruling will make it easier for states like Oklahoma to continue to use midazolam, and to continue carry out executions.

The case is also notable because two liberal justices, Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, announced that they believe the time has come to declare the death penalty unconstitutional.

That announcement is expected to trigger a new round of litigation in death penalty cases with an eye toward bringing a dispute to the high court that might facilitate a decision striking down capital punishment throughout the US. As in most other high profile cases, the outcome in that one would likely, once again, come down to the vote of Justice Kennedy.",www.csmonitor.com,center,3khF8uETWo2rfuMQ

`` So many friends in my contacts , '' the 54-year-old explained , gesturing to his mobile phone , `` they are non-Muslims , and we have been living like brothers . [ But ] we ca n't talk to them now , to ask how they are doing , because we have lost that connection . ''
On April 21 , at least 149 people were killed when a suicide bomber targeted St Sebastian 's church in Negombo , one of six coordinated bombings that killed 269 people and wounded more than 500 others across the South Asian island nation .
The bombings rocked the country , which had not seen such violence since the conclusion of its 26-year civil war in 2009 . Soon after the attacks , the authorities said the National Thowheed Jamath ( NTJ ) , a local armed group that has ties to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL or ISIS ) , was responsible . Police said Zahran Hashim , a `` radical '' Sri Lankan Muslim preacher from the island 's eastern region , had masterminded the bombings .
The claim sent shockwaves through Sri Lanka , where a Muslim minority of about 10 percent of the country 's 21.8 million population had largely been living in peace .

In Negombo , located 40km ( 25 miles ) north of the capital Colombo , the news instantly got the Muslim community worried , residents told ███ .
`` [ We were told by Christian friends ] that Muslims , you should n't come here , even to the hospital , '' said Salim Siraj , 37 , a local Muslim community leader , who explained that many Muslims rushed to the hospital or attack site to try to help . `` The Muslims who went to help those people , they were chased back and told not to come . ''
In an instant , Siraj said , years of trust and harmony had evaporated .
`` We had no idea what has happened and who is behind it , but already it was framed that it was done by the Muslim community . So we were stuck in the middle : we ca n't even go and help them , but also we ca n't even defend ourselves . ''
Hours later , the reprisals began . First , unidentified men attacked the town 's numerous Muslim-run businesses , throwing stones through shop windows or leaving pork - forbidden in Islam - outside Muslim butcher shops .
About two weeks later , dozens of Christians rampaged into a Muslim neighbourhood , damaging more than 85 houses and scores of vehicles over the course of an hour and a half , as police enforced a curfew on the city , Muslim community members said .
In other towns , Sinhala Buddhist mobs also attacked Muslim communities , resulting in widespread damage and at least one death .

As Sri Lanka gears up for a presidential election , in which national security has become a core campaign issue , the tensions in Negombo illustrate growing divisions between religious communities as a result of the April attacks and subsequent retaliations .
According to an International Crisis Group ( ICG ) report , Muslims have been increasingly targeted by arbitrary arrests , attacks and business boycotts . Since April , at least 1,800 Muslims have been arrested in connection with the bombings , the report says , with more than 300 still in custody .
A police spokesperson was unable to confirm the figures to ███ .
A few kilometres away from Negombo 's main mosque , St Sebastian 's Church gleams in the winter sun , now almost completely rebuilt after the attack . Worshippers fill the pews for Sunday service and spill out into a grey-bricked courtyard lined with palm trees .
Rohini Kothalawala , 45 , a housewife who converted to Christianity from Buddhism 30 years ago , was in one of the front pews when the bomb exploded .
`` There was a loud 'dhoom ' sound inside , '' she said , standing under the shade of a tree beside the church . `` There was like a brown smoke , so we could n't see anyone inside the church . ''

Other Christians in Negombo told ███ that they , too , were refusing to patronise businesses owned by Muslims because of the attacks , although some explained that they had recently begun to ease the boycott .
Father Sachitha Jayalath , a priest at St Sebastian 's , said the level of suspicion of the Muslim community , after widespread arrests and police claims that `` weapons caches '' had been recovered across the island following the attacks , was understandable .
`` At many places , there were weapons found out , so obviously one can ask 'OK , did they all know this , were they planning for something like that , for another ethnic conflict ? ' , '' said Jayalath as he sat at his desk in a terracotta-roofed building adjacent to the church . `` I think it is obviously reasonable to ask that question . ''
Local Muslims , however , said they felt they were being deliberately alienated from their friends and neighbours by those seeking to demonise the community .

In what has been a raucous and divisive election campaign , Gotabaya Rajapaksa , of the opposition Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna ( SLPP ) , has emerged as a marginal frontrunner in a race where any advantage is razor-thin .
Rajapaksa , brother of former two-term president Mahinda Rajapaksa and a former defence chief who oversaw the end of the civil war , announced his candidacy for president within days of the attacks . He has made a point of making national security a major campaign issue , accusing the government of `` dismantling '' intelligence structures he had set up when he was in government .
Sajith Premadasa , the ruling United National Party ( UNP ) candidate , has also distanced himself from the government on certain issues , and promised to address widespread failures of the state 's security and intelligence apparatus identified by a parliamentary investigation report released last month .
The attacks targeting Sri Lanka 's Muslim minority following the Easter bombings were not , however , the first time the Muslim community has been in the crosshairs in recent years . Since 2011 , Buddhist nationalist groups have held several protests and rallies - some of which devolved into riots and attacks on Muslims - calling for a Sinhalese-dominated form of government , according to the ICG report .

Athuraliye Rathana , a member of parliament and prominent Buddhist monk , has been a part of that campaign , calling for Muslim universities and certain mosques to be shut down , and for Muslim politicians to be investigated for ties to armed groups .
In May , Rathana undertook a hunger strike protest demanding that two provincial governors and a minister - all Muslims - resign over his allegations that they were supporting armed groups . Within days , all three were forced to leave office , with an additional six Muslim ministers resigning in protest . The allegations remain unproven , although a court case is pending .

`` I do n't think the future for Muslims will be better . What I think is that 'bad ' is better than 'worse ' . ''","Negombo, Sri Lanka - Sitting in the tiled courtyard of a silver-domed mosque in the western Sri Lankan coastal town of Negombo, Aslam Ghafoor said he fears that his neighbours no longer trust him.

""So many friends in my contacts,"" the 54-year-old explained, gesturing to his mobile phone, ""they are non-Muslims, and we have been living like brothers. [But] we can't talk to them now, to ask how they are doing, because we have lost that connection.""

On April 21, at least 149 people were killed when a suicide bomber targeted St Sebastian's church in Negombo, one of six coordinated bombings that killed 269 people and wounded more than 500 others across the South Asian island nation.

The bombings rocked the country, which had not seen such violence since the conclusion of its 26-year civil war in 2009. Soon after the attacks, the authorities said the National Thowheed Jamath (NTJ), a local armed group that has ties to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS), was responsible. Police said Zahran Hashim, a ""radical"" Sri Lankan Muslim preacher from the island's eastern region, had masterminded the bombings.

The claim sent shockwaves through Sri Lanka, where a Muslim minority of about 10 percent of the country's 21.8 million population had largely been living in peace.

In Negombo, located 40km (25 miles) north of the capital Colombo, the news instantly got the Muslim community worried, residents told Al Jazeera.

""[We were told by Christian friends] that Muslims, you shouldn't come here, even to the hospital,"" said Salim Siraj, 37, a local Muslim community leader, who explained that many Muslims rushed to the hospital or attack site to try to help. ""The Muslims who went to help those people, they were chased back and told not to come.""

In an instant, Siraj said, years of trust and harmony had evaporated.

""We had no idea what has happened and who is behind it, but already it was framed that it was done by the Muslim community. So we were stuck in the middle: we can't even go and help them, but also we can't even defend ourselves.""

Hours later, the reprisals began. First, unidentified men attacked the town's numerous Muslim-run businesses, throwing stones through shop windows or leaving pork - forbidden in Islam - outside Muslim butcher shops.

About two weeks later, dozens of Christians rampaged into a Muslim neighbourhood, damaging more than 85 houses and scores of vehicles over the course of an hour and a half, as police enforced a curfew on the city, Muslim community members said.

In other towns, Sinhala Buddhist mobs also attacked Muslim communities, resulting in widespread damage and at least one death.

As Sri Lanka gears up for a presidential election, in which national security has become a core campaign issue, the tensions in Negombo illustrate growing divisions between religious communities as a result of the April attacks and subsequent retaliations.

According to an International Crisis Group (ICG) report, Muslims have been increasingly targeted by arbitrary arrests, attacks and business boycotts. Since April, at least 1,800 Muslims have been arrested in connection with the bombings, the report says, with more than 300 still in custody.

A police spokesperson was unable to confirm the figures to Al Jazeera.

'Pieces of flesh'

A few kilometres away from Negombo's main mosque, St Sebastian's Church gleams in the winter sun, now almost completely rebuilt after the attack. Worshippers fill the pews for Sunday service and spill out into a grey-bricked courtyard lined with palm trees.

Rohini Kothalawala, 45, a housewife who converted to Christianity from Buddhism 30 years ago, was in one of the front pews when the bomb exploded.

""There was a loud 'dhoom' sound inside,"" she said, standing under the shade of a tree beside the church. ""There was like a brown smoke, so we couldn't see anyone inside the church.""

Kothalawala recalled how, for the first few moments, she stood, in shock, rooted to the spot. Her 26-year-old daughter had to drag her outside.

Outside, she said she could smell ""meat and blood"", but was still unable to process what had happened.

""There were people screaming outside, there were people bleeding. But I didn't feel it as much. I was just wiping blood and pieces of flesh off my children.""

Shortly after, she walked back into the church to find a plastic bag with her belongings in it.

""I bent down to get the bag, and on the bench behind me, I looked back and saw lying on the bench a severed head.""

She later learned that it belonged to the bomber.

Since that day, Kothalawala has not gone to a shop or business owned by a Muslim.

""We don't want to go those shops, because they are the ones who came into our church, where we were worshipping our Lord, and they did this to us,"" she said, emphasising the word ""our"".

There is a crack [between people], and you can't fix it. Once a thing cracks, it's very difficult to fix it again … the crack will remain. Now our lives are almost over. Our time is finished, but for the next generation, it will be very difficult for them. Why? Because wherever we go, they look at us differently. Muhammad Iftikhar, Muslim businessman

The world-renowned tenor Andrea Bocelli, country singer Nathan Carter and acclaimed Irish singer Daniel O'Donnell were among those who performed.

The Ireland that the Pope is visiting is a different country to that which greeted Pope John Paul II in 1979.

Since the Polish pope's visit, there have been huge changes in public attitudes to social issues including abortion, contraception, divorce and same-sex marriage.

The country voted for constitutional change on same sex-marriage in 2015 and voted overwhelmingly to overturn its strict abortion law in May.

Pope Francis heard Mr Varadkar, a gay man, speak out against the traditional Catholic teaching on the family.

The taoiseach said that the Republic of Ireland had modernised its laws, ""understanding that marriages do not always work, that women should make their own decisions and that families come in many forms"" - including those headed by a lone parent, same-sex parents or parents who are divorced and remarried.",www.bbc.com,center,3wXADF6kUO3WYj8i

The Vatican has announced an end to an overhaul of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious — an abrupt conclusion to a five-year doctrinal overhaul of the main umbrella group for nuns in the U.S. that began in 2012.

The Vatican said Thursday that it has accepted a report on the overhaul of the LCWR ""marking the conclusion of the Doctrinal Assessment"" of the umbrella group.

Walker, Michael Brendan Dougherty, Matthew Continetti, Daniel J. Mahoney, Andrew C. Mccarthy, Kevin D. Williamson, John Mccormack, Mario Loyola, Armond White","Supporters sing the national anthem as they wait for President Donald Trump to make a speech to evangelical supporters in Miami , Fla. , January 3 , 2020 . ( Eva Marie Uzcategui/Reuters )
It ’ s a complicated situation for religious conservatives . But these are complicated times .
In January 2021 , someone will take the presidential oath of office , and religious conservatives will undoubtedly play a crucial role in whom it will be . Their influence will be the focus of an untold number of postmortems , of the type they ’ ve been accustomed to hearing since 2016 , when the notorious “ 81 percent ” of evangelicals voted for the unlikeliest of candidates : Donald Trump . There are two competing interpretations of Trump ’ s enthusiastic support from religious conservatives : that it is a lesser-of-two-evils transaction based on self-interest , or that it shows a voting bloc compromised by every form of democratic vice , whether racism , nativism , or nationalism .
If trends hold , there will be a similar turnout in 2020 . Rather than wait for the postmortem , I can tell you what will happen now : Millions of religious conservatives will approach their votes with a political realism that requires balancing undesirable tensions and conflicting realities . They will vote not so much for Donald Trump — with his uncouth speech and incessantly immature tweets — as they will vote against the worldview of the Democratic platform . Those who make this calculation are not sell-outs , nor have they forfeited the credibility of their values carte blanche . For blind allegiance does not explain the voting relationship . That religious conservatives are not progressives does . Between Never Trump and Always Trump is a third category : Reluctant Trump . Voters in this category don ’ t get the fair hearing they deserve , since they defy the simple binary portrayal of religious conservatives as either offended by Trump or sold out to him .
Whatever scorn religious conservatives receive from secular and religious elites — whether fairly or unfairly — for abandoning their principles , exhibiting moral hypocrisy , or being complicit in an administration that Americans hear almost daily is an ‘ existential threat ’ to America , the reality is that religious conservatives of this third-way variety approach politics with far more complexity and internal tension than journalists claim . I should know , for I am a religious conservative . I ’ ve been schooled in their institutions . I am not writing the all-too-typical renunciation and self-hating hit piece to distance myself from my fellow religious conservatives . I embrace them as my people . But I ’ m not making this argument for myself . I ’ m making it on behalf of those I live with , talk to , and know to be nobler than the representation they get in the media . While I did not vote for Trump in 2016 , I ’ ve backed off my former insistence that a Trump vote means automatically surrendering one ’ s principles .
As a religious conservative who has lived , worked , and operated among religious conservatives at the levels of public policy , congregational life , grassroots , and academia , I find that the constant volley of attacks directed at them misses the layers and rationales that undergird their voting profiles , mature political reflections , and political psyches .
Critics , whether secular or religious , are right to note the odd relationship between religious conservatives and Donald Trump . The refrain is familiar : To anyone with a conscience , Trump is both lewd and prurient , a man whose life has involved adultery , misogyny , racial insensitivity , vainglory , profanity , deceit , sexual aggression , divorce , fornication , casinos , and porn . Religious conservatives should not accept these vices , but rather denounce them . With Trump , it ’ s easier to find what offends the religious-conservative conscience than to find what does not .
Here was a man whose career and persona typify all that religious conservatives have protested in American culture . Or , lest we overlook recent history , a persona that religious conservatives spent the late 1990s imputing to President Bill Clinton . Critics of religious conservatives correctly point out what seems a glaring contradiction : Some religious-conservative leaders ignore or downplay moral indiscretions when it is their political party in power . Though religious conservatives don ’ t believe morality is relative , the moral outrage directed at Clinton is notably absent with Trump .
But an event on October 10 , 2019 explains the odd-couple relationship of religious conservatives and Donald Trump . That evening , during a CNN townhall on LGBTQ issues , the now-former Democratic presidential candidate Beto O ’ Rourke proclaimed that churches failing to toe the line on gay and transgender rights would lose their tax-exempt status in his administration . O ’ Rourke ’ s comments represented a high-water mark of a culture that has jettisoned anything resembling a Christian moral ecology . Never mind that O ’ Rourke ’ s candidacy is over . It was an Overton Window–shifting moment .
O ’ Rourke ’ s comments reminded religious conservatives why so many of them voted for Trump in 2016 , even if doing so felt hypocritical and seemed like a betrayal of their principles — and why they will likely do so again in 2020 , despite their realism about his character . O ’ Rourke ’ s promise to remove tax exemptions only reinforced the embattled mentality of most religious conservatives , which mobilizes them as voters . The problem was not only with O ’ Rourke ’ s tax policy , however . It ’ s also that the rhetoric of progressives around sexual orientation and gender identity logically leads to the conclusion that O ’ Rourke simply dared to state honestly : It is illogical to say that Christianity is “ harmful ” to gay and transgender persons and then not to want it somehow punished . For years , religious conservatives predicted that the sexual revolution would eventually affect government policy and directly threaten churches . They can now point to O ’ Rourke and other examples as evidence of a massive cultural shift that has realized their predictions . Even the most convinced progressive should sympathize with religious conservatives who are concerned about federal law possibly turning against them .
While Christians must cast off both unwarranted fear and moral panic , rejecting both does not remove the real concerns that persist among religious conservatives . Most criticisms of how religious conservatives understand the world miss the mark . They fail to capture fully the moral landscape and moral contrasts that are formed by believing in a world richly enchanted with divine order . Christians who refract cultural disputes through sexuality and gender do so not because they are obsessed with either , but because the two reflect larger debates about morality , human nature , authority , the role of government , and the nature of justice . Our moral debates are not ephemeral ; they are , rather , metaphysical and cosmological . Thus , when religious conservatives of the Reluctant Trump variety vote , they are not thinking merely about one man , even if he has reconfigured the relationship between character and electability and defined both the presidency and elections as character tests downward . They are thinking about the larger moral worldview to which the party is committed .
In my experience , huge numbers of religious conservatives are not proud about voting for Trump . They don ’ t need any more hot takes denouncing them as irredeemable hypocrites . Their consciences bear a discomfort governed by their love for America and the reputation of their faith . But if these religious conservatives have to choose between the dueling dumpster fires of either Trump or a possible Bernie Sanders presidency , they will vote overwhelmingly for Trump . And anyone who misunderstands this will continue projecting onto religious conservatives the usual tired bromides that refuse to reckon with a complicated situation .
Some religious conservatives may see the world in moral terms — right and wrong ; black and white . But there ’ s a long moral tradition , as far back as Augustine , that sees our world in shades of gray . The City of God lives as earthly inhabitants of the City of Man ; thus , our world is imperfect . We are to be “ in the world , but not of it. ” History does not progress only toward human perfection . In this calculus , religious conservatives might see moral contrasts in black and white , but see voting for a morally compromised figure whose administration pushes back against progressivism as an uncomfortable shade of gray . They understand that , in a fallen world , they will not always be able to vote for candidates of good character and policy . Sometimes , all the candidates are deeply flawed , and a judgment is required of how to steward faithfully one ’ s democratic privileges .
O ’ Rourke ’ s remarks were consistent with a larger profile of issues in which religious conservatives see a moral obligation to engage , even if that means using a blunt instrument like President Trump . These voters are willing to strike a straight lick with a crooked stick , but that doesn ’ t mean that they can ’ t see that the stick is crooked . Consider the Democrats ’ garish and unapologetic devotion to abortion in the latest stages of pregnancy . Anyone who wonders why religious conservatives can not bring themselves to vote for Democrats simply does not understand the religiously formed conscience that shudders at America ’ s abortion regime . This sentiment was intensified during last week ’ s State of the Union address , when Democrats sat stone-faced at President Trump ’ s call for banning late-term abortion . A moment of such moral contrast demonstrates why religious conservatives do not care about the endless think pieces criticizing them as soulless hypocrites . They will endure that criticism if it means the chance to end abortion through Supreme Court appointments .
To the average religious conservative ( like me ) , there is no moral ambiguity about abortion . It must be stopped . It ’ s a morally transcendent issue . The figures bear out the astonishing loss of life sanctioned by American law . That does not make other issues totally irrelevant to religious conservatism . It does evidence a moral urgency that forces religious conservatives to triage their votes . Immigration policy matters . Police brutality can not fall on deaf ears . Opioid addiction is ravaging America . Religious conservatives care about these issues and work to find solutions . But to religious conservatives , these concerns do not rise to the level of what seems to be a targeted , lavishly funded assault on human life itself , one proceeding from a worldview that rejects the metaphysical claims of Christianity . Progressives may not like how religious conservatives rank what are morally transcendent issues . But progressives have their own morally transcendent issues as well .
Call it self-preservation , or call it transactional politics , but religious conservatives continue to find themselves forced into alliance with a party whose nominal leader once declared that he has no need to ask for God ’ s forgiveness . If this does not strike enthusiastic , religious-conservative Trump voters as odd , it might be that their faith is being more influenced by their politics than vice versa . It might be convenient to blame all of this apparent hypocrisy on religious conservatives ’ being cheap dates . But it is also a political reality that the Democratic Party bears responsibility for creating . Its uncompromising alliance with basic violations of the Ten Commandments , the First Amendment , and natural law means its platform flows from a moral ecology that has put believers on the defensive . This rationale echoes the sentiment of Princeton professor Robert George , who acknowledged that support for Trump “ is based on a prudential judgment that the overall situation for the common good would be made much worse if he were to lose to one of the Democrats . And they fear — with justification — that the consequences for themselves and their religious institutions would be dire if such a thing were to happen. ” O ’ Rourke ’ s admission only furthers that mindset . Religious conservatives are faced with the undesired situation of choosing between two alternatives : a compromised , unqualified figurehead , or a disastrous policy platform that bears the marks of intrinsic evil , such as abortion .
That ’ s the settlement that most religious conservatives live with when it comes to Trump . They ’ ll settle for a morally compromised , ill-tempered man restrained by the Constitution if it means incremental wins . No religious conservative I know does not wince , grimace , or eyeroll at many of President Trump ’ s actions , even those who voted for him with more enthusiasm than I am comfortable with . They see him as a compromised contrast to their faith . These religious conservatives are stuck between the tensions of embarrassment when the president ’ s petulant rage is on full 280-character display , and relief when they see a policy action or personnel decision that they prefer .
In this regard , religious conservatives show the best and worst about American politics . In the best sense , they demonstrate the tensions of believing in something morally transcendent , yet being restrained by compromised political realities that require painful , incremental compromise . The best of religious conservatism understands that this moment is one of great tension and unease , and that for religious conservatism to be coherent , its message must be credible . And President Trump ’ s persona is an affront to a morally serious religious conservatism . But honest religious conservatism knows that in a fallen political order , some degree of compromise will be necessary , even if uncomfortable .
In the worst sense , they can be intoxicated by close proximity to power , in turn doing the bidding of their superiors for a seat at the table . If I ’ m right that the vast majority of religious conservatives only reluctantly support Trump , it still does not exonerate religious leaders who rush to Trump ’ s defense whenever his latest indiscretion surfaces . I understand the rationale that leads a Christian to vote for Donald Trump ; I don ’ t understand expending energy to make him something he ’ s not , or to dismiss his indiscretions as common misbehavior . The worst of religious conservatism is on cable news imputing to Trump an almost-Constantinian prestige , uniting nationalist fervor with religious revivalism . We can not countenance a subversion of our faith that reduces piety down to power .
Cable-news catechumens need rebuke . A little less deserving of rebuke are those who chastise Trump voters that make pained voting decisions . Those who hope to sway voters away from Trump through endless berating think pieces will fail . Nor will religious conservatives heed lectures on the problems of moral compromise in voting for Trump from other co-religionists who easily justified their votes for Obama on faith grounds . Only one who neither fully endorses everything that the Trump administration supports , nor mockingly condescends to voters whose legitimate cultural angst leads them to reluctantly pull the lever for Trump , can be persuasive .
I don ’ t know anyone who fails to express serious misgivings about Donald Trump . I say that as the Midwestern son of a factory worker who grew up amid corn fields . That does not mean that unfailingly loyal Trump supporters do not exist . They do , and they need a gut-examination on what is most important : power or integrity . Yet the popular media narrative has frustratingly often overlooked or ignored this reality altogether . Instead , a more convenient , if not intellectually dishonest , portrait emerges that vents rage at “ white evangelicalism. ” By placing outsized focus on religious conservatives ’ slavish devotion to Trump , this tactic discredits the foundations of religious conservatism by putting more blame at their feet than is fair or accurate to reality .
I write as neither a Trump critic nor Trump apologist , nor am I defending a vote for Trump in 2020 . I am also not attempting a statistical breakdown . Statistics do not , and can not , capture the complexity of religious conservatives . Monocausal explanations such as fear , nostalgia , and power are silly . My experience with actual religious conservatives — not the zoo-like Neanderthal depiction that fits the desired stereotype — suggests a lot more is going on behind the craven Trump-devotion caricature . I write to explain what is going on . Progressives will likely not be persuaded that religious conservatives are correct for voting how they do ; but perhaps they could better understand the rationale . If progressives can not , it only confirms the suspicions of many religious conservatives that America suffers from moral balkanization , wherein its citizens are occupying incompatible moral universes .
To understand this complexity , take my real-life friend . Let ’ s call him Steve . Steve is a white evangelical in his forties , a middle-school teacher , the father of two daughters , and a deacon at his Southern Baptist church . These are identities that media narratives depict as culprits for Trump ’ s ascension : White , male , Christian , middle-class , husband , father . He ’ s the token “ white evangelical ” that the media depicts as red-state reprobates .
But there is more to Steve . Steve serves the homeless , sees diversity as a pillar of God ’ s creation , and helped an Iraqi refugee family resettle in his own hometown . I daresay he cares more about justice in real life than those who preen about it on Twitter .
Steve voted for Trump , and will again . Why ? For one , he thinks abortion is America ’ s Holocaust , and will not support any party that supports abortion on demand . Whatever Trump ’ s eccentricities are , Steve won ’ t vote for a progressive , even if the media tells him that to do so would save America and its institutions . For Steve , saving abstractions like “ America ” and its “ institutions ” can make America a lot less worthy of survival if abortion on demand continues apace . To the average religious conservative , in fact , saving America means saving it from the scourge of abortion .
Those are the stakes that many religious conservatives live with . My advice to progressives is that , if they want religious conservatives to let go of their devotion to the Republican Party ’ s platform , progressives should weaken their commitment to unfettered abortion access . The same goes for their support for gender fluidity , and opposition to any person or institution that does not affirm such things as gay marriage . Until that happens , complaining about “ white evangelicalism ” and ascribing to it every imaginable authoritarian impulse will be like shouting into a void ; no one will listen .
Also , in Steve ’ s thinking , the mainstream media is so blinded by its anti-Trump rage that it has seriously impaired its credibility . This is not # FakeNews conspiracy-peddling , but a real belief that the media ’ s trustworthiness has collapsed under its derangement . Trump criticism becomes ignorable once every action of Trump is subject to criticism .
Steve does not think President Trump is a Christian . He ’ s embarrassed by Trump ’ s moral failings and thinks he ’ s a terrible model for his daughters . But is this the stereotypical “ white evangelical ” responsible for America ’ s downfall , who wants to revive racism and drive immigrants out of this country ? No .
Steve ’ s approach embodies the complexity of voting . Some vote for the person on the ballot . Others vote for the platform , not the person . Others are voting for the personnel of an administration . In this paradigm , the office of the presidency is bigger than just one man . It is not so much a matter of who occupies the office as much as it a serious consideration of whom the president will choose for all levels of government . Another rationale would be a policy preference . Perhaps a person votes for the overall economic model that a president ’ s administration would implement . The last paradigm would be one of political necessity : Somebody is going to be president , and whatever trade-offs will have to be made , candidate A is on the whole preferable to candidate B. I can not bind someone ’ s conscience for making strained , calculated trade-offs , but many in the media do .
Whatever relationship there is between religious conservatives and Trump is not one of principle . It is a pragmatic concession yielding to the realities of living in a fallen , fractured world where perfect candidates are unavailable . Whatever results , the history and tensions of religious conservative support for Donald Trump will be a memory of discomfort and awkwardness .
What ’ s the downside to this argument ? The bargain religious conservatives struck with Trump on good things like judges and legislation will make it appear as though this group has to continue defending his presidency when there is little will to do so . It ’ s likely the anguished religious conservatives will be drowned out by a chorus of far more loyal supporters , and in turn be difficult to identify as a niche constituency that is not wholly in Trump ’ s corner .
The best step forward for Reluctant Trump religious conservatives is to keep their conscience and integrity unstained . This means calling balls and strikes on a man whose administration is advancing good things , but who is discolored by vices and impulses that make total fealty impossible .
Most people who vote are not obsessed with politics . It ’ s not where their identities are found . These are people whose primary identity is that of a mother , father , or employee . Not everything about them can be explained by , or reduced to , their politics . They support a flawed candidate , and aren ’ t ashamed to say so . They are genuine in their faith convictions . If they vote this way , I ’ m not going to judge them or impute to them the worst offenses imaginable . Neither should you .
When I hear the oft-mentioned 81 percent figure , and how this number demonstrates a total capitulation of religious conservatism to power-hungry self-interestedness , I wonder : Should religious conservatives repudiate their moral and policy convictions just because Donald Trump is in the White House ? Should they then vote for the Democratic candidate , or not vote at all ? The constant criticism of religious conservatives ’ voting en masse for Donald Trump never comes with a suggestion of better alternatives .
What are religious conservatives like my friend Steve to do ? Of course , voting for one of the major parties is not a moral obligation . Maybe the progressive request is to simply sit 2020 out ? Vote third party ? While these are conscionable solutions , I have never heard a satisfying answer that takes into consideration that someone will be president . And a simple vote does not reflect the underlying tension at play in people like Steve .
Donald Trump is not the savior of American Christianity . At best , he ’ s a bed of nails on the road , temporarily halting secularism ’ s advance .
Yet the choice for so many religious conservatives is between someone who is crude and profane but who will defend their values and an eloquent politician who will undermine their faith and advance an agenda they see as barbaric and unjust .
Here ’ s my plea from one religious conservative to other religious conservatives in 2020 . If the majority of us vote for Trump , let ’ s do so not because he ’ s a Protector of the Faith or a champion for “ taking America back. ” He ’ s neither . Instead , view him as a flawed , complex political figure whose admixture of vanity and pragmatism is resulting in a political agenda that is less hostile to Christianity than its alternatives .
There must be an Augustinian account that takes stock of politics in a fallen age . Moral and political realism has been on short order , and now is the time for its rebirth . The witness of religious conservatism in 2020 can be neither silence , capitulation , devotion , nor derangement . Political realism is inescapably driving people to make some type of decision . If religious conservatives are going to pursue political realism , do so as resident aliens and alien residents , people who know this world is not all there is , and lay claim to the promise of a world to come .","Supporters sing the national anthem as they wait for President Donald Trump to make a speech to evangelical supporters in Miami, Fla., January 3, 2020.

It’s a complicated situation for religious conservatives. But these are complicated times.

In January 2021, someone will take the presidential oath of office, and religious conservatives will undoubtedly play a crucial role in whom it will be. Their influence will be the focus of an untold number of postmortems, of the type they’ve been accustomed to hearing since 2016, when the notorious “81 percent” of evangelicals voted for the unlikeliest of candidates: Donald Trump. There are two competing interpretations of Trump’s enthusiastic support from religious conservatives: that it is a lesser-of-two-evils transaction based on self-interest, or that it shows a voting bloc compromised by every form of democratic vice, whether racism, nativism, or nationalism.

If trends hold, there will be a similar turnout in 2020. Rather than wait for the postmortem, I can tell you what will happen now: Millions of religious conservatives will approach their votes with a political realism that requires balancing undesirable tensions and conflicting realities. They will vote not so much for Donald Trump — with his uncouth speech and incessantly immature tweets — as they will vote against the worldview of the Democratic platform. Those who make this calculation are not sell-outs, nor have they forfeited the credibility of their values carte blanche. For blind allegiance does not explain the voting relationship. That religious conservatives are not progressives does. Between Never Trump and Always Trump is a third category: Reluctant Trump. Voters in this category don’t get the fair hearing they deserve, since they defy the simple binary portrayal of religious conservatives as either offended by Trump or sold out to him.

Whatever scorn religious conservatives receive from secular and religious elites — whether fairly or unfairly — for abandoning their principles, exhibiting moral hypocrisy, or being complicit in an administration that Americans hear almost daily is an ‘existential threat’ to America, the reality is that religious conservatives of this third-way variety approach politics with far more complexity and internal tension than journalists claim. I should know, for I am a religious conservative. I’ve been schooled in their institutions. I am not writing the all-too-typical renunciation and self-hating hit piece to distance myself from my fellow religious conservatives. I embrace them as my people. But I’m not making this argument for myself. I’m making it on behalf of those I live with, talk to, and know to be nobler than the representation they get in the media. While I did not vote for Trump in 2016, I’ve backed off my former insistence that a Trump vote means automatically surrendering one’s principles.

As a religious conservative who has lived, worked, and operated among religious conservatives at the levels of public policy, congregational life, grassroots, and academia, I find that the constant volley of attacks directed at them misses the layers and rationales that undergird their voting profiles, mature political reflections, and political psyches.

Critics, whether secular or religious, are right to note the odd relationship between religious conservatives and Donald Trump. The refrain is familiar: To anyone with a conscience, Trump is both lewd and prurient, a man whose life has involved adultery, misogyny, racial insensitivity, vainglory, profanity, deceit, sexual aggression, divorce, fornication, casinos, and porn. Religious conservatives should not accept these vices, but rather denounce them. With Trump, it’s easier to find what offends the religious-conservative conscience than to find what does not.

Here was a man whose career and persona typify all that religious conservatives have protested in American culture. Or, lest we overlook recent history, a persona that religious conservatives spent the late 1990s imputing to President Bill Clinton. Critics of religious conservatives correctly point out what seems a glaring contradiction: Some religious-conservative leaders ignore or downplay moral indiscretions when it is their political party in power. Though religious conservatives don’t believe morality is relative, the moral outrage directed at Clinton is notably absent with Trump.

But an event on October 10, 2019 explains the odd-couple relationship of religious conservatives and Donald Trump. That evening, during a CNN townhall on LGBTQ issues, the now-former Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke proclaimed that churches failing to toe the line on gay and transgender rights would lose their tax-exempt status in his administration. O’Rourke’s comments represented a high-water mark of a culture that has jettisoned anything resembling a Christian moral ecology. Never mind that O’Rourke’s candidacy is over. It was an Overton Window–shifting moment.

O’Rourke’s comments reminded religious conservatives why so many of them voted for Trump in 2016, even if doing so felt hypocritical and seemed like a betrayal of their principles — and why they will likely do so again in 2020, despite their realism about his character. O’Rourke’s promise to remove tax exemptions only reinforced the embattled mentality of most religious conservatives, which mobilizes them as voters. The problem was not only with O’Rourke’s tax policy, however. It’s also that the rhetoric of progressives around sexual orientation and gender identity logically leads to the conclusion that O’Rourke simply dared to state honestly: It is illogical to say that Christianity is “harmful” to gay and transgender persons and then not to want it somehow punished. For years, religious conservatives predicted that the sexual revolution would eventually affect government policy and directly threaten churches. They can now point to O’Rourke and other examples as evidence of a massive cultural shift that has realized their predictions. Even the most convinced progressive should sympathize with religious conservatives who are concerned about federal law possibly turning against them.

While Christians must cast off both unwarranted fear and moral panic, rejecting both does not remove the real concerns that persist among religious conservatives. Most criticisms of how religious conservatives understand the world miss the mark. They fail to capture fully the moral landscape and moral contrasts that are formed by believing in a world richly enchanted with divine order. Christians who refract cultural disputes through sexuality and gender do so not because they are obsessed with either, but because the two reflect larger debates about morality, human nature, authority, the role of government, and the nature of justice. Our moral debates are not ephemeral; they are, rather, metaphysical and cosmological. Thus, when religious conservatives of the Reluctant Trump variety vote, they are not thinking merely about one man, even if he has reconfigured the relationship between character and electability and defined both the presidency and elections as character tests downward. They are thinking about the larger moral worldview to which the party is committed.

In my experience, huge numbers of religious conservatives are not proud about voting for Trump. They don’t need any more hot takes denouncing them as irredeemable hypocrites. Their consciences bear a discomfort governed by their love for America and the reputation of their faith. But if these religious conservatives have to choose between the dueling dumpster fires of either Trump or a possible Bernie Sanders presidency, they will vote overwhelmingly for Trump. And anyone who misunderstands this will continue projecting onto religious conservatives the usual tired bromides that refuse to reckon with a complicated situation.

Some religious conservatives may see the world in moral terms — right and wrong; black and white. But there’s a long moral tradition, as far back as Augustine, that sees our world in shades of gray. The City of God lives as earthly inhabitants of the City of Man; thus, our world is imperfect. We are to be “in the world, but not of it.” History does not progress only toward human perfection. In this calculus, religious conservatives might see moral contrasts in black and white, but see voting for a morally compromised figure whose administration pushes back against progressivism as an uncomfortable shade of gray. They understand that, in a fallen world, they will not always be able to vote for candidates of good character and policy. Sometimes, all the candidates are deeply flawed, and a judgment is required of how to steward faithfully one’s democratic privileges.

O’Rourke’s remarks were consistent with a larger profile of issues in which religious conservatives see a moral obligation to engage, even if that means using a blunt instrument like President Trump. These voters are willing to strike a straight lick with a crooked stick, but that doesn’t mean that they can’t see that the stick is crooked. Consider the Democrats’ garish and unapologetic devotion to abortion in the latest stages of pregnancy. Anyone who wonders why religious conservatives cannot bring themselves to vote for Democrats simply does not understand the religiously formed conscience that shudders at America’s abortion regime. This sentiment was intensified during last week’s State of the Union address, when Democrats sat stone-faced at President Trump’s call for banning late-term abortion. A moment of such moral contrast demonstrates why religious conservatives do not care about the endless think pieces criticizing them as soulless hypocrites. They will endure that criticism if it means the chance to end abortion through Supreme Court appointments.

To the average religious conservative (like me), there is no moral ambiguity about abortion. It must be stopped. It’s a morally transcendent issue. The figures bear out the astonishing loss of life sanctioned by American law. That does not make other issues totally irrelevant to religious conservatism. It does evidence a moral urgency that forces religious conservatives to triage their votes. Immigration policy matters. Police brutality cannot fall on deaf ears. Opioid addiction is ravaging America. Religious conservatives care about these issues and work to find solutions. But to religious conservatives, these concerns do not rise to the level of what seems to be a targeted, lavishly funded assault on human life itself, one proceeding from a worldview that rejects the metaphysical claims of Christianity. Progressives may not like how religious conservatives rank what are morally transcendent issues. But progressives have their own morally transcendent issues as well.

Call it self-preservation, or call it transactional politics, but religious conservatives continue to find themselves forced into alliance with a party whose nominal leader once declared that he has no need to ask for God’s forgiveness. If this does not strike enthusiastic, religious-conservative Trump voters as odd, it might be that their faith is being more influenced by their politics than vice versa. It might be convenient to blame all of this apparent hypocrisy on religious conservatives’ being cheap dates. But it is also a political reality that the Democratic Party bears responsibility for creating. Its uncompromising alliance with basic violations of the Ten Commandments, the First Amendment, and natural law means its platform flows from a moral ecology that has put believers on the defensive. This rationale echoes the sentiment of Princeton professor Robert George, who acknowledged that support for Trump “is based on a prudential judgment that the overall situation for the common good would be made much worse if he were to lose to one of the Democrats. And they fear — with justification — that the consequences for themselves and their religious institutions would be dire if such a thing were to happen.” O’Rourke’s admission only furthers that mindset. Religious conservatives are faced with the undesired situation of choosing between two alternatives: a compromised, unqualified figurehead, or a disastrous policy platform that bears the marks of intrinsic evil, such as abortion.

* * *

That’s the settlement that most religious conservatives live with when it comes to Trump. They’ll settle for a morally compromised, ill-tempered man restrained by the Constitution if it means incremental wins. No religious conservative I know does not wince, grimace, or eyeroll at many of President Trump’s actions, even those who voted for him with more enthusiasm than I am comfortable with. They see him as a compromised contrast to their faith. These religious conservatives are stuck between the tensions of embarrassment when the president’s petulant rage is on full 280-character display, and relief when they see a policy action or personnel decision that they prefer.

In this regard, religious conservatives show the best and worst about American politics. In the best sense, they demonstrate the tensions of believing in something morally transcendent, yet being restrained by compromised political realities that require painful, incremental compromise. The best of religious conservatism understands that this moment is one of great tension and unease, and that for religious conservatism to be coherent, its message must be credible. And President Trump’s persona is an affront to a morally serious religious conservatism. But honest religious conservatism knows that in a fallen political order, some degree of compromise will be necessary, even if uncomfortable.

In the worst sense, they can be intoxicated by close proximity to power, in turn doing the bidding of their superiors for a seat at the table. If I’m right that the vast majority of religious conservatives only reluctantly support Trump, it still does not exonerate religious leaders who rush to Trump’s defense whenever his latest indiscretion surfaces. I understand the rationale that leads a Christian to vote for Donald Trump; I don’t understand expending energy to make him something he’s not, or to dismiss his indiscretions as common misbehavior. The worst of religious conservatism is on cable news imputing to Trump an almost-Constantinian prestige, uniting nationalist fervor with religious revivalism. We cannot countenance a subversion of our faith that reduces piety down to power.

Cable-news catechumens need rebuke. A little less deserving of rebuke are those who chastise Trump voters that make pained voting decisions. Those who hope to sway voters away from Trump through endless berating think pieces will fail. Nor will religious conservatives heed lectures on the problems of moral compromise in voting for Trump from other co-religionists who easily justified their votes for Obama on faith grounds. Only one who neither fully endorses everything that the Trump administration supports, nor mockingly condescends to voters whose legitimate cultural angst leads them to reluctantly pull the lever for Trump, can be persuasive.

I don’t know anyone who fails to express serious misgivings about Donald Trump. I say that as the Midwestern son of a factory worker who grew up amid corn fields. That does not mean that unfailingly loyal Trump supporters do not exist. They do, and they need a gut-examination on what is most important: power or integrity. Yet the popular media narrative has frustratingly often overlooked or ignored this reality altogether. Instead, a more convenient, if not intellectually dishonest, portrait emerges that vents rage at “white evangelicalism.” By placing outsized focus on religious conservatives’ slavish devotion to Trump, this tactic discredits the foundations of religious conservatism by putting more blame at their feet than is fair or accurate to reality.

I write as neither a Trump critic nor Trump apologist, nor am I defending a vote for Trump in 2020. I am also not attempting a statistical breakdown. Statistics do not, and cannot, capture the complexity of religious conservatives. Monocausal explanations such as fear, nostalgia, and power are silly. My experience with actual religious conservatives — not the zoo-like Neanderthal depiction that fits the desired stereotype — suggests a lot more is going on behind the craven Trump-devotion caricature. I write to explain what is going on. Progressives will likely not be persuaded that religious conservatives are correct for voting how they do; but perhaps they could better understand the rationale. If progressives cannot, it only confirms the suspicions of many religious conservatives that America suffers from moral balkanization, wherein its citizens are occupying incompatible moral universes.

To understand this complexity, take my real-life friend. Let’s call him Steve. Steve is a white evangelical in his forties, a middle-school teacher, the father of two daughters, and a deacon at his Southern Baptist church. These are identities that media narratives depict as culprits for Trump’s ascension: White, male, Christian, middle-class, husband, father. He’s the token “white evangelical” that the media depicts as red-state reprobates.

But there is more to Steve. Steve serves the homeless, sees diversity as a pillar of God’s creation, and helped an Iraqi refugee family resettle in his own hometown. I daresay he cares more about justice in real life than those who preen about it on Twitter.

Steve voted for Trump, and will again. Why? For one, he thinks abortion is America’s Holocaust, and will not support any party that supports abortion on demand. Whatever Trump’s eccentricities are, Steve won’t vote for a progressive, even if the media tells him that to do so would save America and its institutions. For Steve, saving abstractions like “America” and its “institutions” can make America a lot less worthy of survival if abortion on demand continues apace. To the average religious conservative, in fact, saving America means saving it from the scourge of abortion.

Those are the stakes that many religious conservatives live with. My advice to progressives is that, if they want religious conservatives to let go of their devotion to the Republican Party’s platform, progressives should weaken their commitment to unfettered abortion access. The same goes for their support for gender fluidity, and opposition to any person or institution that does not affirm such things as gay marriage. Until that happens, complaining about “white evangelicalism” and ascribing to it every imaginable authoritarian impulse will be like shouting into a void; no one will listen.

Also, in Steve’s thinking, the mainstream media is so blinded by its anti-Trump rage that it has seriously impaired its credibility. This is not #FakeNews conspiracy-peddling, but a real belief that the media’s trustworthiness has collapsed under its derangement. Trump criticism becomes ignorable once every action of Trump is subject to criticism.

Steve does not think President Trump is a Christian. He’s embarrassed by Trump’s moral failings and thinks he’s a terrible model for his daughters. But is this the stereotypical “white evangelical” responsible for America’s downfall, who wants to revive racism and drive immigrants out of this country? No.

Steve’s approach embodies the complexity of voting. Some vote for the person on the ballot. Others vote for the platform, not the person. Others are voting for the personnel of an administration. In this paradigm, the office of the presidency is bigger than just one man. It is not so much a matter of who occupies the office as much as it a serious consideration of whom the president will choose for all levels of government. Another rationale would be a policy preference. Perhaps a person votes for the overall economic model that a president’s administration would implement. The last paradigm would be one of political necessity: Somebody is going to be president, and whatever trade-offs will have to be made, candidate A is on the whole preferable to candidate B. I cannot bind someone’s conscience for making strained, calculated trade-offs, but many in the media do.

Whatever relationship there is between religious conservatives and Trump is not one of principle. It is a pragmatic concession yielding to the realities of living in a fallen, fractured world where perfect candidates are unavailable. Whatever results, the history and tensions of religious conservative support for Donald Trump will be a memory of discomfort and awkwardness.

What’s the downside to this argument? The bargain religious conservatives struck with Trump on good things like judges and legislation will make it appear as though this group has to continue defending his presidency when there is little will to do so. It’s likely the anguished religious conservatives will be drowned out by a chorus of far more loyal supporters, and in turn be difficult to identify as a niche constituency that is not wholly in Trump’s corner.

The best step forward for Reluctant Trump religious conservatives is to keep their conscience and integrity unstained. This means calling balls and strikes on a man whose administration is advancing good things, but who is discolored by vices and impulses that make total fealty impossible.

Most people who vote are not obsessed with politics. It’s not where their identities are found. These are people whose primary identity is that of a mother, father, or employee. Not everything about them can be explained by, or reduced to, their politics. They support a flawed candidate, and aren’t ashamed to say so. They are genuine in their faith convictions. If they vote this way, I’m not going to judge them or impute to them the worst offenses imaginable. Neither should you.

When I hear the oft-mentioned 81 percent figure, and how this number demonstrates a total capitulation of religious conservatism to power-hungry self-interestedness, I wonder: Should religious conservatives repudiate their moral and policy convictions just because Donald Trump is in the White House? Should they then vote for the Democratic candidate, or not vote at all? The constant criticism of religious conservatives’ voting en masse for Donald Trump never comes with a suggestion of better alternatives.

What are religious conservatives like my friend Steve to do? Of course, voting for one of the major parties is not a moral obligation. Maybe the progressive request is to simply sit 2020 out? Vote third party? While these are conscionable solutions, I have never heard a satisfying answer that takes into consideration that someone will be president. And a simple vote does not reflect the underlying tension at play in people like Steve.

Donald Trump is not the savior of American Christianity. At best, he’s a bed of nails on the road, temporarily halting secularism’s advance.

Yet the choice for so many religious conservatives is between someone who is crude and profane but who will defend their values and an eloquent politician who will undermine their faith and advance an agenda they see as barbaric and unjust.

Here’s my plea from one religious conservative to other religious conservatives in 2020. If the majority of us vote for Trump, let’s do so not because he’s a Protector of the Faith or a champion for “taking America back.” He’s neither. Instead, view him as a flawed, complex political figure whose admixture of vanity and pragmatism is resulting in a political agenda that is less hostile to Christianity than its alternatives.

There must be an Augustinian account that takes stock of politics in a fallen age. Moral and political realism has been on short order, and now is the time for its rebirth. The witness of religious conservatism in 2020 can be neither silence, capitulation, devotion, nor derangement. Political realism is inescapably driving people to make some type of decision.

Declaring `` no one should be censoring sermons , '' Trump announced the order , which fulfilled a campaign pledge , during a Rose Garden ceremony Thursday attended by religious leaders , activists and Vice President Pence .
“ We will not allow people of faith to be targeted , bullied or silenced again and we will never stand for religious discrimination , ” Trump said before signing the order , which states it is now administration policy is “ to protect and vigorously promote religious liberty . ”
The ban on political speech from the pulpit is rooted in an amendment introduced in 1954 by then-Democratic Sen. Lyndon Johnson that gave the IRS authority to punish tax-exempt charitable organizations , including churches , for making political endorsements or getting involved in political campaigns .
The order directs the IRS to exercise maximum enforcement discretion to alleviate the burden of the so-called Johnson Amendment .
In addition , it instructs the Treasury Department not to target the tax-exempt status of churches and other institutions if they express support for political candidates .
The order also directs the Department of Justice to ensure religious protections are afforded to individuals and groups , such as Little Sisters of the Poor , a group of nuns who take a vow of poverty in serving the elderly .
In his introductory remarks , Pence said the National Day of Prayer is a time to reaffirm “ the vital role people of faith play in American society ” and praised the president for marking the day in such a public manner .
Trump campaigned against the ban and pledged in his address to the Republican National Convention that he would “ work very hard to repeal that language and to protect free speech for all Americans . ”
Trump called up several of the Little Sisters of the Poor members and congratulated them on their landmark victory in the Supreme Court over the issue of the contraceptive mandate included in ObamaCare .
According to Trump , more than 50 religious groups filed lawsuits against the Obama administration for violating their religious liberty .
Before the final order was released , several religious liberty groups expressed support for the administration ’ s actions .
“ The first freedom in the Bill of Rights is religious freedom . America was born on the foundation of religious freedom and it is one of our most cherished liberties . There could be no better day to sign an executive order on religious freedom than the National Day of Prayer , ” said Mat Staver , chairman of Liberty Counsel .
Mark Rienzi , counsel for The Becket Fund , said on Twitter he was encouraged by the “ promise of the protection ” coming from the White House and looked forward to seeing the final language .
The Becket Fund is the public interest law firm which has represented the Little Sisters of the Poor in their fight to be exempted from ObamaCare ’ s contraceptive mandate .
The executive order drew critics from the left and the right .
`` If the … EO on religious liberty ends up being what media outlets are currently reporting , then it 'll be woefully inadequate , '' tweeted Ryan Anderson , a senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation .
The American Civil Liberties Union argued the executive actions constitute “ a broadside to our country ’ s long-standing commitment to the separation of church and state ” that will divide the nation and permit discrimination .
`` President Trump ’ s efforts to promote religious freedom are thinly-veiled efforts to unleash his conservative religious base into the political arena while also using religion to discriminate . It ’ s a dual dose of pandering to a base and denying reproductive care . We will see Trump in court , again , ” said ACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero in a statement .","President Trump marked the National Day of Prayer by signing an executive order aimed at boosting religious freedom by easing IRS restrictions against political activities by tax-exempt religious organizations, including churches.

Declaring ""no one should be censoring sermons,"" Trump announced the order, which fulfilled a campaign pledge, during a Rose Garden ceremony Thursday attended by religious leaders, activists and Vice President Pence.

“We will not allow people of faith to be targeted, bullied or silenced again and we will never stand for religious discrimination,” Trump said before signing the order, which states it is now administration policy is “to protect and vigorously promote religious liberty.”

EXECUTIVE ORDER: PROMOTING FREE SPEECH AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY

The ban on political speech from the pulpit is rooted in an amendment introduced in 1954 by then-Democratic Sen. Lyndon Johnson that gave the IRS authority to punish tax-exempt charitable organizations, including churches, for making political endorsements or getting involved in political campaigns.

The order directs the IRS to exercise maximum enforcement discretion to alleviate the burden of the so-called Johnson Amendment.

In addition, it instructs the Treasury Department not to target the tax-exempt status of churches and other institutions if they express support for political candidates.

The order also directs the Department of Justice to ensure religious protections are afforded to individuals and groups, such as Little Sisters of the Poor, a group of nuns who take a vow of poverty in serving the elderly.

In his introductory remarks, Pence said the National Day of Prayer is a time to reaffirm “the vital role people of faith play in American society” and praised the president for marking the day in such a public manner.

Trump campaigned against the ban and pledged in his address to the Republican National Convention that he would “work very hard to repeal that language and to protect free speech for all Americans.”

Trump called up several of the Little Sisters of the Poor members and congratulated them on their landmark victory in the Supreme Court over the issue of the contraceptive mandate included in ObamaCare.

According to Trump, more than 50 religious groups filed lawsuits against the Obama administration for violating their religious liberty.

Before the final order was released, several religious liberty groups expressed support for the administration’s actions.

“The first freedom in the Bill of Rights is religious freedom. America was born on the foundation of religious freedom and it is one of our most cherished liberties. There could be no better day to sign an executive order on religious freedom than the National Day of Prayer,” said Mat Staver, chairman of Liberty Counsel.

Mark Rienzi, counsel for The Becket Fund, said on Twitter he was encouraged by the “promise of the protection” coming from the White House and looked forward to seeing the final language.

The Becket Fund is the public interest law firm which has represented the Little Sisters of the Poor in their fight to be exempted from ObamaCare’s contraceptive mandate.

The executive order drew critics from the left and the right.

""If the … EO on religious liberty ends up being what media outlets are currently reporting, then it'll be woefully inadequate,"" tweeted Ryan Anderson, a senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation.

The American Civil Liberties Union argued the executive actions constitute “a broadside to our country’s long-standing commitment to the separation of church and state” that will divide the nation and permit discrimination.

""President Trump’s efforts to promote religious freedom are thinly-veiled efforts to unleash his conservative religious base into the political arena while also using religion to discriminate. It’s a dual dose of pandering to a base and denying reproductive care. We will see Trump in court, again,” said ACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero in a statement.

“This is the most shocking piece of evidence I’ve seen in the 12 years of religious liberty work that I’ve been doing,” said Hiram Sasser, the Liberty Institute’s director of litigation.

I reached out to the superintendent of Broward County Schools as well as the chairman of the school board. Neither returned my messages.

Last Christmas Giovanni received a Bible from his local church. It quickly became a prized possession and one of his favorite books to read.

“I love reading my Bible any time that I’m allowed to read it,” the boy told me in a telephone conservation.

So that’s why Giovanni brought his Bible to school -- to read his Bible during a 90-minute session designated for free reading.

Yet one group of local clergy has been working hard to secure a seat at the table – arranging a series of intimate meetings with White House hopefuls . The Love 2020 participants have raced , sometimes with just a few hours ’ notice , to meet with candidates in churches , barns , anywhere they can get a brief audience with the person who might be their next president . They say they ’ re trying to reframe what faith-based political action can look like , and inject faith-based , moral concerns into Democratic presidential politics .
In 2008 , then-candidate Barack Obama ’ s campaign team called on religious leaders in New Hampshire individually , according to the Rev . Jason Wells , executive director of the New Hampshire Council of Churches . This cycle , campaigns don ’ t seem to be wooing faith leaders as they used to , Mr. Wells says .
The Rev . Jonathan Hopkins wishes every candidate for president would grapple with a troubling truth about this city : Many working people aren ’ t making ends meet . Some are still in their Walmart uniforms when they ’ re fed at the soup kitchen where he and his congregants volunteer .
Now , with the Feb. 8 New Hampshire primary fast approaching , Mr. Hopkins is finding he doesn ’ t have to wish quite so much . He ’ s part of a group of New Hampshire clergy who have been meeting with White House hopefuls , in an effort to inject faith-based , moral concerns into Democratic presidential politics . For the candidates , these Love 2020 events offer a chance to get cozy with religious movers and shakers who , they hope , might sway some of the voters in their flocks .
Mr. Hopkins wants to know what each candidate will do to break the cycle of poverty for working people . So far , he ’ s participated in sit-downs with Sens . Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren , and Pete Buttigieg , former mayor of South Bend , Indiana .
“ We are asking questions that are not being asked of them in general , ” says Mr. Hopkins , pastor of Concordia Lutheran Church in Concord . It ’ s an arena where spirituality is explored – even with candidates like Senator Sanders , who describes himself as “ not particularly religious . ”
“ Bernie , for sure , he ’ s got some spiritual depth , ” says Mr. Hopkins . “ Maybe not religious depth , but spiritual depth . ... He said we all should care about the least among us . ”
Sessions with 11 Democratic candidates and one Republican ( former Massachusetts Gov . Bill Weld ) were all open to the press , according to Love 2020 organizers . But when Mr. Buttigieg sat down with the group in early January at St. Paul ’ s Church in downtown Concord , campaign staffers insisted that this reporter wait outside , despite having been invited to cover the event . They gave no reason , saying only that the meeting was private .
Mr. Buttigieg , an Episcopalian , is hardly shy about his Christian faith , which he often invokes on the campaign trail as a moral guide for shaping policy positions . “ What ’ s important to me is to make sure that I ’ m engaging with [ faith leaders ] and with those that they guide and care for , ” he said after the meeting , as a black SUV waited to whisk him to a Nashua town hall event . With recent polls showing a tight race in New Hampshire , the campaign was perhaps taking no chances on a religion-charged gaffe .
Courtesy of Arnie Alpert The Rev . Jonathan Hopkins speaks with Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg , the former mayor of South Bend , Indiana , during a Love 2020 event Jan. 4 , 2020 , in Concord , New Hampshire . It ’ s an effort to connect clergy with candidates in a Democratic Party that ’ s increasingly secular .
Navigating the sensitive terrain where faith meets progressive politics is par for the course for Love 2020 , a project of the Granite State Organizing Project ( GSOP ) , which brings together religious leaders , community organizers , and labor unions to tackle issues such as immigration and economic justice . It ’ s an effort to connect clergy with candidates in a Democratic Party that ’ s increasingly secular and cautiously experimenting to find where faith fits , if anywhere , in its political mix .
For candidates , courting clergy support is nothing new – not even here , in what is , according to Gallup and the Pew Research Center , one of America ’ s least religious states . In 2008 , then-candidate Barack Obama ’ s campaign team called on religious leaders individually , according to the Rev . Jason Wells , executive director of the New Hampshire Council of Churches . Inspired by the outreach , Mr. Wells , who was then a parish rector , volunteered for Mr. Obama by canvassing door to door in his time off .
This time around , campaigns don ’ t seem to be wooing faith leaders individually as they used to , Mr. Wells says .
Indeed , Love 2020 was born to fill a void , organizers say , amid a growing dearth of meaningful dialogue with candidates . Campaigns are often most concerned with preventing unscripted soundbites , notes Arnie Alpert , co-director of the New Hampshire Program of the American Friends Service Committee , a Quaker-based activist organization . For example , when Senator Warren does her famous selfie line for photos , “ her staff people take your phone from you , and then they take the ‘ selfie , ’ ” Mr. Alpert says with a laugh . “ What that does is keep you from using your phone to actually record the interaction . ”
Progressive faith leaders believe Love 2020 provides a meaningful alternative – and they ’ ve been working hard to secure a seat at the table in New Hampshire . They have raced , sometimes with just a few hours ’ notice , to meet with candidates in churches , barns , anywhere they can get a brief audience with the person who might be their next president . They say they ’ re trying to reframe what faith-based political action can look like .
“ We do not talk about abortion , we do not talk about the traditional faith-based things , ” said Eva Castillo , a Venezuelan immigrant who directs the New Hampshire Alliance of Immigrants and Refugees . “ We show them a different face of faith , you know ? More open-minded , more equalizing . ”
All the major Democratic contenders , with the exception so far of former Vice President Joe Biden , have carved out time to meet with the Love 2020 group of clerics , each of whom has a local following and a measure of clout .
“ This spotlight on our state gives us a chance to influence the national dialogue , ” says GSOP Executive Director Sarah Jane Knoy . “ To focus on our shared values and our common humanity – because the current national dialogue is very divisive and , I think , really kind of hateful . ”
For local religious leaders , Love 2020 also provides a platform to ask the kinds of values questions candidates don ’ t always hear elsewhere . In a video of the Buttigieg session , provided by Love 2020 organizers , the Rt . Rev . Robert Hirschfeld , bishop of the Episcopal Church of New Hampshire , can be heard asking : “ What ’ s in your soul ? What ’ s in your heart that is going to help us reknit together the torn social fabric ? ”
Mr. Buttigieg responded that when he ’ s campaigning , his soul is “ just out there for everyone to see . ”
“ There is a crisis of belonging in our country that I think is propelling everything from the brokenness of our politics to mental health issues ” including rising rates of suicide and drug addiction , he told the group . “ Holding the American project together depends so much on whether we can create that sense of belonging . ... It may well be the most important function of the presidency . ”
The clergy also minister to the candidates they meet , much as evangelical leaders have done when laying hands on President Donald Trump and praying for him . Mr. Hirschfeld led Mr. Buttigieg and the assembled group in prayer .

The Rev . Sarah Rockwell of St. Andrew ’ s Church in Manchester offered another kind of spiritual support to Mr. Buttigieg , as he navigates the pressures and personal tolls of running for president . “ Keeping a marriage intact – it is not easy , ” Ms. Rockwell quietly said to the candidate as they left the meeting room . “ You are in my prayers , and so is he . ”
“ Thank you , ” Mr. Buttigieg said with a smile . “ Keep the prayers coming . ”","“We do not talk about abortion; we do not talk about the traditional faith-based things,” said Eva Castillo, a Venezuelan immigrant who directs the New Hampshire Alliance of Immigrants and Refugees. “We show them a different face of faith, you know?

They say they’re trying to reframe what faith-based political action can look like, and inject faith-based, moral concerns into Democratic presidential politics.

In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama’s campaign team called on religious leaders in New Hampshire individually, according to the Rev. Jason Wells, executive director of the New Hampshire Council of Churches. This cycle, campaigns don’t seem to be wooing faith leaders as they used to, Mr. Wells says.

The Rev. Jonathan Hopkins wishes every candidate for president would grapple with a troubling truth about this city: Many working people aren’t making ends meet. Some are still in their Walmart uniforms when they’re fed at the soup kitchen where he and his congregants volunteer.

Now, with the Feb. 8 New Hampshire primary fast approaching, Mr. Hopkins is finding he doesn’t have to wish quite so much. He’s part of a group of New Hampshire clergy who have been meeting with White House hopefuls, in an effort to inject faith-based, moral concerns into Democratic presidential politics. For the candidates, these Love 2020 events offer a chance to get cozy with religious movers and shakers who, they hope, might sway some of the voters in their flocks.

Mr. Hopkins wants to know what each candidate will do to break the cycle of poverty for working people. So far, he’s participated in sit-downs with Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, and Pete Buttigieg, former mayor of South Bend, Indiana.

“We are asking questions that are not being asked of them in general,” says Mr. Hopkins, pastor of Concordia Lutheran Church in Concord. It’s an arena where spirituality is explored – even with candidates like Senator Sanders, who describes himself as “not particularly religious.”

“Bernie, for sure, he’s got some spiritual depth,” says Mr. Hopkins. “Maybe not religious depth, but spiritual depth. ... He said we all should care about the least among us.”

Sessions with 11 Democratic candidates and one Republican (former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld) were all open to the press, according to Love 2020 organizers. But when Mr. Buttigieg sat down with the group in early January at St. Paul’s Church in downtown Concord, campaign staffers insisted that this reporter wait outside, despite having been invited to cover the event. They gave no reason, saying only that the meeting was private.

Mr. Buttigieg, an Episcopalian, is hardly shy about his Christian faith, which he often invokes on the campaign trail as a moral guide for shaping policy positions. “What’s important to me is to make sure that I’m engaging with [faith leaders] and with those that they guide and care for,” he said after the meeting, as a black SUV waited to whisk him to a Nashua town hall event. With recent polls showing a tight race in New Hampshire, the campaign was perhaps taking no chances on a religion-charged gaffe.

Courtesy of Arnie Alpert The Rev. Jonathan Hopkins speaks with Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, during a Love 2020 event Jan. 4, 2020, in Concord, New Hampshire. It’s an effort to connect clergy with candidates in a Democratic Party that’s increasingly secular.

Navigating the sensitive terrain where faith meets progressive politics is par for the course for Love 2020, a project of the Granite State Organizing Project (GSOP), which brings together religious leaders, community organizers, and labor unions to tackle issues such as immigration and economic justice. It’s an effort to connect clergy with candidates in a Democratic Party that’s increasingly secular and cautiously experimenting to find where faith fits, if anywhere, in its political mix.

For candidates, courting clergy support is nothing new – not even here, in what is, according to Gallup and the Pew Research Center, one of America’s least religious states. In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama’s campaign team called on religious leaders individually, according to the Rev. Jason Wells, executive director of the New Hampshire Council of Churches. Inspired by the outreach, Mr. Wells, who was then a parish rector, volunteered for Mr. Obama by canvassing door to door in his time off.

This time around, campaigns don’t seem to be wooing faith leaders individually as they used to, Mr. Wells says.

Indeed, Love 2020 was born to fill a void, organizers say, amid a growing dearth of meaningful dialogue with candidates. Campaigns are often most concerned with preventing unscripted soundbites, notes Arnie Alpert, co-director of the New Hampshire Program of the American Friends Service Committee, a Quaker-based activist organization. For example, when Senator Warren does her famous selfie line for photos, “her staff people take your phone from you, and then they take the ‘selfie,’” Mr. Alpert says with a laugh. “What that does is keep you from using your phone to actually record the interaction.”

Progressive faith leaders believe Love 2020 provides a meaningful alternative – and they’ve been working hard to secure a seat at the table in New Hampshire. They have raced, sometimes with just a few hours’ notice, to meet with candidates in churches, barns, anywhere they can get a brief audience with the person who might be their next president. They say they’re trying to reframe what faith-based political action can look like.

“We do not talk about abortion, we do not talk about the traditional faith-based things,” said Eva Castillo, a Venezuelan immigrant who directs the New Hampshire Alliance of Immigrants and Refugees. “We show them a different face of faith, you know? More open-minded, more equalizing.”

All the major Democratic contenders, with the exception so far of former Vice President Joe Biden, have carved out time to meet with the Love 2020 group of clerics, each of whom has a local following and a measure of clout.

“This spotlight on our state gives us a chance to influence the national dialogue,” says GSOP Executive Director Sarah Jane Knoy. “To focus on our shared values and our common humanity – because the current national dialogue is very divisive and, I think, really kind of hateful.”

For local religious leaders, Love 2020 also provides a platform to ask the kinds of values questions candidates don’t always hear elsewhere. In a video of the Buttigieg session, provided by Love 2020 organizers, the Rt. Rev. Robert Hirschfeld, bishop of the Episcopal Church of New Hampshire, can be heard asking: “What’s in your soul? What’s in your heart that is going to help us reknit together the torn social fabric?”

Mr. Buttigieg responded that when he’s campaigning, his soul is “just out there for everyone to see.”

“There is a crisis of belonging in our country that I think is propelling everything from the brokenness of our politics to mental health issues” including rising rates of suicide and drug addiction, he told the group. “Holding the American project together depends so much on whether we can create that sense of belonging. ... It may well be the most important function of the presidency.”

The clergy also minister to the candidates they meet, much as evangelical leaders have done when laying hands on President Donald Trump and praying for him. Mr. Hirschfeld led Mr. Buttigieg and the assembled group in prayer.

The Rev. Sarah Rockwell of St. Andrew’s Church in Manchester offered another kind of spiritual support to Mr. Buttigieg, as he navigates the pressures and personal tolls of running for president. “Keeping a marriage intact – it is not easy,” Ms. Rockwell quietly said to the candidate as they left the meeting room. “You are in my prayers, and so is he.”

“Thank you,” Mr. Buttigieg said with a smile. “Keep the prayers coming.”",www.csmonitor.com,center,PCbZiK9rBnwSo9LC

The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops ( USCCB ) condemned new regulations to implement President Obama ’ s July 21

These regulations were put in place by the Department of Labor last week in an update “ to add gender identity and sexual orientation to the classes it protects ” against discrimination .
`` This rule will extend protections to millions of workers who are employed by or seek jobs with federal contractors and subcontractors , ensuring that sexual orientation and gender identity are never used as justification for workplace discrimination by those that profit from taxpayer dollars , '' said Patricia A.

However the bishops called these regulations “ a serious threat to freedom of conscience and religious liberty . ”
“ Additionally , the regulations advance the false ideology of ‘ gender identity , ’ which ignores biological reality and harms the privacy and associational rights of both contractors and their employees , ” the bishops noted .
“ Our Church teaches that ' [ e ] very sign of unjust discrimination ' against those who experience same-sex attraction 'should be avoided ' ( Catechism of the Catholic Church , CCC 2358 ) -- but it appears on an initial reading that these regulations would prohibit far more than that ‘ unjust discrimination , ’ ” the bishops said in a statement on Friday .

USA TODAY

BERLIN — Pope Francis called on religious communities and Catholic parishes across Europe on Sunday to take on the crush of migrants that have been pouring into the continent recently.

He said the Vatican will shelter two families who are ""fleeing death.""

Francis cited Mother Teresa, the European-born nun who cared for the poorest in India, in making his appeal. ""Faced with the tragedy of tens of thousands of refugees who are fleeing death by war and by hunger, and who are on a path toward a hope for life, the Gospel calls us to be neighbors to the smallest and most abandoned, to give them concrete hope,"" Francis said, adding that it's not enough to say, ""Have courage, hang in there.""

The pope’s plea comes as thousands more refugees from war-torn countries such as Syria and Afghanistan were expected to arrive in Austria and Germany on Sunday. The migrants were traveling from Hungary where they had been stranded for days as European leaders debate how to best handle the surge.

On Saturday, about 7,000 people crossed the border on foot from Hungary to Austria. A similar amount arrived into Munich's central train station by Saturday evening.



""I appeal to the parishes, the religious communities, the monasteries and sanctuaries of all Europe to ... take in one family of refugees,"" Pope Francis said after his Sunday address in the Vatican, according to Reuters.



There are more than 25,000 parishes in Italy alone, and more than 12,000 in Germany, where many of the Syrians fleeing civil war and people trying to escape poverty and hardship in other countries say they want to end up.



The pope’s call was another in a series of recent public interventions by the Vatican to end conflicts and reconcile differences between countries, from Mideast peace meetings to brokering talks between the U.S. and Cuba.



According to Reuters, the crowd in St. Peter's Square on Sunday applauded as the pontiff, himself the grandson of Italian emigrants to Argentina, said: ""Every parish, every religious community, every monastery, every sanctuary of Europe, take in one family.""



Authorities in Budapest had refused to let the migrants travel amid confusion from European Union member states about what to do with the new arrivals.



Europe is absorbing tens of thousands of people this year from Africa, the Middle East and Asia who are desperate to reach the region.



Gulf states idle as migrant crisis swells in Europe

People from Syria, Afghanistan and Eritrea fleeing conflict and repression in those nations represent the largest number of people on the move.



More than 3,700 people around the world have died in 2015 as they attempt to escape war, persecution and economic hardship, according to the International Organization for Migration.



Europe, with its relatively robust welfare states and infrastructure for asylum seekers, is better placed, many argue, to handle the influx than nations in the Middle East region. Persian Gulf states have donated millions of dollars but have not resettled people in significant numbers. That inaction has brought them criticism from some quarters.



Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Sunday his government was considering accepting more Syrian refugees.

Around half of Syria's population of 20 million have fled the country or been displaced internally amid a civil war that has raged for over four years.

Authorities in Cyprus rescued 114 people Sunday about 50 miles off the coast of the Mediterranean island after the fishing boat they were in ran into trouble.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel meanwhile is holding crisis talks on the thousands of refugees and migrants who want to come to Germany.

She wants other EU member states to take more refugees.

Berlin estimates that up to 800,000 people may seek asylum in Germany before the end of the year, far more than any other EU country, and the chancellor is also concerned that extremists may try to stoke anti-refugee sentiment.

Some far-right groups in Germany, for example, protested the arrival of refugees and migrants from Hungary in Dortmund overnight.

religion_and_faith,Fox Online News,2,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/10/29/houston-mayor-drops-bid-to-subpoena-pastors-sermons/,OPINION: Houston mayor drops bid to subpoena pastors' sermons,2014-10-29,Todd Starnes,"Subpoenas issued to five Houston pastors demanding all sermons and correspondence dealing with homosexuality , gender identity and the city 's Equal Rights ordinance have been withdrawn , the city ’ s first openly lesbian mayor announced at a Wednesday press conference .
`` After much contemplation and discussion , I am directing the city legal department to withdraw the subpoenas issued to the five Houston pastors who delivered the petitions , the anti-HERO petitions , to the city of Houston and who indicated that they were responsible for the overall petition effort , '' said Mayor Annise Parker in remarks covered by television station KPRC .
My column on the issue sparked a bit of national outrage – well – a lot of national outrage . To be honest it was a full-scale hullabaloo . City Hall was deluged with telephone calls , letters , emails – along with hundreds of Bibles and sermons . More than 50,000 supporters signed a petition .
Nevertheless , the mayor still seems hell-bent on defending the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance – a piece of legislation that will in part give grown men who identify as women the right to use the restrooms of their choice .
`` It is extremely important to me to protect our Equal Rights Ordinance from repeal , and it is extremely important to me to make sure that every Houstonian knows that their lives are valid and protected and acknowledged , '' Parker said . `` We are going to continue to vigorously defend our ordinance against repeal efforts . ''
The subpoenas were issued in response to a lawsuit filed related to the so-called bathroom bill . An overwhelming number of religious groups were opposed to a provision of the law that would allow men who identify as women to use the restrooms of their choice .
Critics gathered 50,000 signatures to petition the city to put the issue on the ballot . But the city attorney threw out the petitions – alleging there were not enough legitimate signatures .
Erik Stanley , an attorney for Alliance Defending Freedom , represented the five pastors . He said he was gratified the mayor withdrew the subpoenas .
“ She really had no choice but to withdraw the subpoenas , ” Stanley told me . “ She was roundly criticized from the right and the left – from all across the nation . ”
Stanley said the mayor ’ s actions were a violation of the First Amendment and an abuse of power .
“ They were only intended to intimidate and to bully pastors into silence , ” he said of the subpoenas . “ It sent a terrible message to the faith community in Houston and across the country . ”
Pastor Steve Riggle was one of the ministers who was subpoenaed .
“ You are not a little dictator to do whatever you want – and that ’ s what we have right now in Houston , Texas , ” he said . “ It ’ s important that everybody keep their eye on what ’ s happening here . ”
The Family Research Council is hosting a nationally-simulcast rally at Riggle ’ s mega-church on Sunday . Thousands are expected to attend “ I Stand Sunday ” in person and more than 2,500 churches and home groups have signed up to air the simulcast .
The event includes messages from former Arkansas Gov . Mike Huckabee , Duck Commander Phil Robertson , and yours truly – among others .
“ This is what bullies do when people stand up to them , ” said Family Research Council President Tony Perkins . “ They back down . ”
Perkins told me the response to “ I Stand Sunday ” has been overwhelming .
“ Americans realize this agenda is not simply about equal rights , ” he said . “ It ’ s about elevated sexual behavior above religious freedom . Americans are tired of being bullied by the left . ”
And let ’ s be honest , folks – that ’ s exactly what ’ s been happening in the Lone Star State . Christians are getting bullied by Houston ’ s mayor and city attorney .
And the only way to stop the bullying is to allow the good people of Houston the right to vote on that nondiscrimination ordinance .
“ This is about political intimidation , ” Perkins said . “ And that intimidation continues as long as the citizens are denied the right to vote on this ordinance . ”

""After much contemplation and discussion, I am directing the city legal department to withdraw the subpoenas issued to the five Houston pastors who delivered the petitions, the anti-HERO petitions, to the city of Houston and who indicated that they were responsible for the overall petition effort,"" said Mayor Annise Parker in remarks covered by television station KPRC.

My column on the issue sparked a bit of national outrage – well – a lot of national outrage. To be honest it was a full-scale hullabaloo. City Hall was deluged with telephone calls, letters, emails – along with hundreds of Bibles and sermons. More than 50,000 supporters signed a petition.

Nevertheless, the mayor still seems hell-bent on defending the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance – a piece of legislation that will in part give grown men who identify as women the right to use the restrooms of their choice.

""It is extremely important to me to protect our Equal Rights Ordinance from repeal, and it is extremely important to me to make sure that every Houstonian knows that their lives are valid and protected and acknowledged,"" Parker said. ""We are going to continue to vigorously defend our ordinance against repeal efforts.""

The subpoenas were issued in response to a lawsuit filed related to the so-called bathroom bill. An overwhelming number of religious groups were opposed to a provision of the law that would allow men who identify as women to use the restrooms of their choice.

Critics gathered 50,000 signatures to petition the city to put the issue on the ballot. But the city attorney threw out the petitions – alleging there were not enough legitimate signatures.

Erik Stanley, an attorney for Alliance Defending Freedom, represented the five pastors. He said he was gratified the mayor withdrew the subpoenas.

“She really had no choice but to withdraw the subpoenas,” Stanley told me. “She was roundly criticized from the right and the left – from all across the nation.”

Stanley said the mayor’s actions were a violation of the First Amendment and an abuse of power.

“They were only intended to intimidate and to bully pastors into silence,” he said of the subpoenas. “It sent a terrible message to the faith community in Houston and across the country.”

Pastor Steve Riggle was one of the ministers who was subpoenaed.

“You don’t mess with the pulpits,” he told me.

His opinion of the mayor remains unchanged.

“You are not a little dictator to do whatever you want – and that’s what we have right now in Houston, Texas,” he said. “It’s important that everybody keep their eye on what’s happening here.”

The Family Research Council is hosting a nationally-simulcast rally at Riggle’s mega-church on Sunday. Thousands are expected to attend “I Stand Sunday” in person and more than 2,500 churches and home groups have signed up to air the simulcast.

The event includes messages from former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Duck Commander Phil Robertson, and yours truly – among others.

“This is what bullies do when people stand up to them,” said Family Research Council President Tony Perkins. “They back down.”

Perkins told me the response to “I Stand Sunday” has been overwhelming.

“Americans realize this agenda is not simply about equal rights,” he said. “It’s about elevated sexual behavior above religious freedom. Americans are tired of being bullied by the left.”

And let’s be honest, folks – that’s exactly what’s been happening in the Lone Star State. Christians are getting bullied by Houston’s mayor and city attorney.

And the only way to stop the bullying is to allow the good people of Houston the right to vote on that nondiscrimination ordinance.

“This is about political intimidation,” Perkins said. “And that intimidation continues as long as the citizens are denied the right to vote on this ordinance.”

Randy White, the pastor of the First Baptist Church in Katy said his congregation is prepared to fight.

“They will stand for any kind of removal of pulpit freedom,” he told me. “The pastor, the church, the congregation has got to be able to speak their mind on issues.”

White delivered an impassioned sermon about religious liberty that went viral online.

“I will not turn over a jot or a tittle,” he announced from the pulpit. He warned that turning over any sermons to the government is the “first step towards totalitarianism.”

But he warned that the fight is not over in Houston.

“We haven’t won,” he said. ‘The citizenry of Houston is still denied the right to petition and to vote on this matter,” he said.

And quite frankly, I’m not sure Houston’s mayor will allow them to vote.

On Tuesday a group of clergy met with Houston’s mayor. Afterwards, some of those ministers met with Pastor Riggle. They relayed a portion of the private conversation they had with the mayor.

“She told them, ‘I’m not going to let the citizens of Houston vote on my civil rights,’” Riggle said.

Friends -- that is a very chilling statement.

And it’s just more that whenever you see the word “nondiscrimination” it usually means religious folks are being discriminated against.

The answer should be obvious : Of course the Constitution does not require states to subsidize religious education—to the contrary , it limits the government ’ s ability to finance religion . Yet the court ’ s conservative majority may be prepared to turn the First Amendment on its head , compelling states to underwrite the religious indoctrination of children .
Wednesday ’ s case , Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue , demonstrates just how far the Supreme Court has shifted to the right in recent years . SCOTUS did not uphold vouchers for parochial schools until 2002 ’ s Zelman v. Simmons-Harris , a 5–4 decision that drew sharp dissents from the liberal justices . Zelman opened the door to “ indirect funding ” for religious education , which proliferated in its wake : Today , 29 states , the District of Columbia , and Puerto Rico provide either vouchers or tax credits that reimburse parents who send their children to sectarian institutions .
Montana is one of those states , but it might not be for much longer . In 2015 , the legislature enacted a program that gave a tax credit of up to $ 150 to individuals who donate to scholarship organizations . These groups then use the donations to award scholarships to students who attend private schools , including religious ones . But the Montana constitution bars the state from using public funds to aid any school that is “ controlled in whole or in part by any church , sect , or denomination. ” In light of this provision , the Montana Supreme Court ruled the tax credit scheme unlawful in 2018 . Rather than limit state funding to secular schools , the court invalidated the entire program .
The plaintiffs in Espinoza , who are represented by the libertarian Institute for Justice , are parents who wanted scholarships to keep their children at a Christian school . They allege that the Montana Supreme Court violated the First Amendment ’ s free exercise clause by axing the scheme . But the plaintiffs have a problem . The core of their argument is that once states fund private schools , they have to include religious schools . Montana , however , can no longer fund any private schools , secular or sectarian . So , the plaintiffs make the broader claim that states can not stop funding all private schools to avoid giving money to religious ones .
During arguments on Wednesday , the liberal justices were skeptical of all this . Because of the Montana Supreme Court ’ s decision , Justice Elena Kagan told the Institute for Justice ’ s Richard Komer , “ whether you go to a religious school or you go to a secular private school , you ’ re in the same boat. ” So “ there is no discrimination at this point going on , is there ? ” Komer claimed that the Montana Supreme Court itself discriminated against religious students by shooting down the tax credit program . Does that mean , Justice Sonia Sotomayor wondered , that Montana has “ to keep the program alive ? ” Yes , Komer said : Once “ the state chose to give aid , ” it could not stop giving aid to refrain from helping parochial schools .
This claim is , to put it mildly , a stretch . There is some precedent for the idea that states can ’ t deny funding to religious institutions because they are religious . In 2017 ’ s Trinity Lutheran v. Comer , the court held that Missouri violated free exercise by refusing to let a church daycare center compete for a grant to resurface its playground . The exclusion of a church from a public benefit “ solely because it is a church , ” the court declared , “ is odious to our Constitution. ” But Trinity Lutheran was explicitly limited to “ express discrimination based on religious identity with respect to playground resurfacing , ” and disclaimed any impact on “ religious uses of funding . ”
Everyone agrees that religious schools , unlike the daycare center , will use taxpayer money to indoctrinate students . So Komer ’ s argument is pretty radical , a far cry from Trinity Lutheran . Just how radical ? In his brief , Komer wrote that a student may not be “ forced to choose between attending a school that accords with her beliefs or receiving thousands of dollars in government benefits. ” But doesn ’ t that mean states have to fund religious education in par with public education ? Komer ’ s claim would seem to give every child a First Amendment right to attend religious schools on the taxpayer ’ s dime .
Justice Stephen Breyer raised this point with Jeffrey Wall , principal deputy solicitor general , who supported the plaintiffs . If a state spends $ 500 million on public education , Breyer asked , does it have to give the same amount to parochial schools ? Wall said no , but Breyer wasn ’ t satisfied . “ What , ” he asked , “ is the difference ? ” Chief Justice John Roberts—who was remarkably perky given his side hustle presiding over the Senate ’ s impeachment trial—had the same question . He asked Adam Unikowsky , who represents Montana , whether Komer ’ s theory “ leads to a situation where the funding that goes to public schools ” would “ have to go to religious schools , ” as well . Unikowsky wasn ’ t sure , but the chief seemed troubled by the possibility .
Predictably , Justices Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh went to bat for Montana ’ s religious families , framing them as victims of appalling discrimination . Kavanaugh told Unikowsky that “ grotesque religious bigotry against Catholics ” was the “ clear motivation ” for Montana ’ s ban on sectarian aid . But as Unikowsky told Kavanaugh , Montana ’ s ban was enacted in 1972 , not to burden religion but to protect it from state interference . Thirty-seven states have similar provisions in their constitutions , and school choice proponents assert that they were motivated by anti-Catholic bias . It ’ s true that Reconstruction-era nativists favored these provisions—but so did advocates for universal education regardless of creed .
Alito tried a different angle : Imagine if a state shut down a scholarship program because money was “ mostly going to blacks and we don ’ t like that. ” If that ’ s unconstitutional—and it surely is—isn ’ t it also unconstitutional to shut down a program because money went to religious schools ?
“ We just don ’ t think that race and religion are identical for all constitutional reasons , ” Unikowsky said . “ Basically , what you ’ re saying , ” Alito snapped , is that “ the difference between this and race is : it ’ s permissible to discriminate on the basis of religion. ” Breyer jumped in to help : “ Yes , ” he said , “ race is different from religion . Why ? There is no establishment clause in regard to race . What is the establishment clause ? Well , it has something to do with not supporting religion . And there is nothing more religious , except perhaps for the service in the church itself , than religious education . ”
Here , Breyer came the closest of any justice to acknowledging a foundational principle oddly obscured in this case : The Constitution mandates the separation of church and state for good reason . Stillwater Christian School , where the plaintiffs send their children , inculcates students with a theology-based anti-LGBTQ ideology . So do at least three other schools that participate in the scholarship program , as HuffPost reported on Thursday . One places “ homosexual and lesbian behavior ” in the same category as “ incest ” and “ bestiality ” while stating that no “ non-Christian ” or “ uncommitted Christian ” could teach there . Another expels students on the basis of “ lesbian , gay , bisexual and/or transgender conduct ” and requires employees “ to affirm that they have not and will not engage in such behaviors . ”
Christian schools have a right to teach this ideology , and Christian parents have a right to send their children to these schools . But shouldn ’ t Montana taxpayers also have a right not to subsidize these teachings , which may violate their own religious beliefs or freedom of conscience ? Can ’ t state embrace the principles of the establishment clause by declining to compel residents to fund faiths that clash with their own beliefs ? If parents want their children to learn that same-sex intimacy is no different from bestiality , is everyone else obligated to help pay for those lessons ?
The fate of Espinoza lies , as usual , in Roberts ’ hands . Because the chief seemed concerned about the alarming implications of the plaintiffs ’ argument , he might join with the liberals to throw out the case . But it ’ s just as likely that the five conservatives will order Montana to revive its tax credit scheme and proclaim that once states give money to private schools , there ’ s not takebacks because religious schools would otherwise face discrimination . That outcome might appear narrow , because it does not force states to fund religious schools in the first place . But it would actually constitute a revolutionary rewrite of the First Amendment .

Pennsylvania Avenue was beginning to buzz. The pope was about to finish his speech to Congress, and crowds of people started lining the street to catch a glimpse of the pontiff.

So far, Pope Francis has become the first pontiff to speak before a joint meeting of Congress. He's also the first pope to canonize a saint on U.S. soil.

But the thing that everybody is talking about is that he's definitely the first pope to ride around town in a little tiny car.

Bill Newbrough, 51, and his co-workers stood on the sidewalk. They were talking about the car.

This is Washington, after all, and this motorcade is slightly different from the ones they've seen before. Newbrough remembered that Mikhail Gorbachev's limo in the '80s was so big that it could only make turns along the main avenues.

""It looks like a clown car when they all get in it. But it's just such a perfect metaphor for his message,"" he said.

For example, when Francis became a cardinal in Argentina, he still used the subway. When he became pope, he shunned a Vatican driver and rode a bus back to the Vatican hotel.

Former U.S. Cardinal Theodore McCarrick has been defrocked by Pope Francis after Vatican officials found him guilty of sexual crimes against minors and adults, the Vatican said Saturday.

McCarrick was a powerful fundraiser in the church. He is the highest-ranking clergy to be laicized by the clerical state. The action strips McCarrick, 88, of priestly rights and bars him from celebrating Mass.

Hundreds of priests have been defrocked for sexual abuse, but laicizing someone of McCarrick's rank is an “almost revolutionary,” move for the church, Kurt Martens, a Catholic University of America canon law professor, told The New York Times.

In July 2018, Pope Francis accepted McCarrick's resignation amid the sex abuse scandal. McCarrick was a retired cardinal at the time and faced allegations of sexually abusing a minor nearly five decades ago when he was a priest in New York. He was also accused of engaging in sexual misconduct with adults while he served in New Jersey.

On Jan. 11, McCarrick — who had once served as the archbishop of Washington — was found guilty of “solicitation in the Sacrament of Confession, and sins against the Sixth Commandment with minors and adults, with the aggravating factor of the abuse of power,” the Vatican said.

The Sixth Commandment addresses sexual behavior.

McCarrick had been embroiled in a scandal that included an apparent open secret that he slept with adult seminarians. He was also found guilty by the Vatican of soliciting for sex while hearing confession.

The sexual abuse of minors by priests and its systematic coverup has been a decades-long crisis for the church. McCarrick's defrocking comes days before Francis is set to lead an international gathering of bishops on the issue of sexual abuse among clergy.

An appeal by McCarrick was rejected and the Vatican said that the decision announced Saturday is final and no longer subject to future appeals.

The meeting between the pontiff and a woman who went to jail for five days for defying a Supreme Court order to allow same-sex couples to marry came before Francis made comments about “ conscientious objection ” as a human right , even for government officials .
In some ways , the meeting fit with the pope ’ s focus on the “ spirit of encounter ” as well as his unorthodox meetings with people he calls on the “ peripheries. ” And it also came days after he met with nuns fighting an Obamacare mandate on contraceptives , another front in the American cultural wars .
But the 15-minute tête-à-tête at the Vatican Embassy in Washington also jarred a number of narratives from the pope ’ s historic visit , suggesting to some critics that the pontiff condoned Davis ’ actions – which critics say amount to imposing her personal religious beliefs , in violation of the Constitution , on same-sex couples seeking marriage licenses .
The decision by the pope to give his personal blessing – and a rosary – to Davis thrust the pontiff into one of America ’ s most volatile cultural battles .
In other ways , however , Francis focused Rome ’ s gaze on the changing dynamics of religious freedom in the progressive era , offering a moment of pause for many Americans to consider growing questions about how the United States handles religious objections to same-sex unions .
“ I think both sides have either tried to vilify or champion Kim Davis in one way or another , but what they ’ re forgetting is that the central issue here is of religious freedom in the US , and how we treat it . What does it mean , and what are its boundaries ? ” says Joe Valenzano , an expert on religious rhetoric at the University of Dayton in Ohio . “ The fact is , both sides have made just a colossal mess out of this to further their own perspective , rather than focusing on what could be a productive conversation for society . ”
The Vatican confirmed the meeting , but gave no further commentary , potentially suggesting that it didn ’ t want to get into the political details of the struggle over same-sex marriage in Rowan County , Ky. For some Vatican observers , it wasn ’ t surprising that the pope , a religious figure , met with someone who has become a lightning rod for her religious beliefs .
The pope “ took somebody on the front of the newspapers for faith-related concerns and met with her , ” says Professor Valenzano . “ [ The pope told Davis that ] you don ’ t lose faith because you lose a battle . That ’ s not the pope weighing in on the culture wars or endorsing Kim Davis ’ s position . That ’ s the pope endorsing the idea that religion is important to people . ”
Yet for all the pope ’ s focus on moral values , the meeting with Davis and the nuns could have a political impact , writes John Allen Jr. , on Crux , a Catholic news site . For one , he writes , the meeting “ means that Francis has significantly strengthened the hand of the US bishops and other voices in American debates defending religious freedom . ”
The meeting also could give more direct encouragement to other US officials who have declined to offer marriage licenses to same-sex couples . A number of clerks and other government officials have followed Davis ’ s lead , refusing to abide by the Supreme Court ’ s June ruling declaring same-sex marriage a constitutional right .
The problem with that strategy , however , is that Davis , for one , represents what Doug Laycock calls a poor example of a religious martyr . He points out that Davis didn ’ t just want an opt-out from signing marriage licenses for same-sex couples . Instead , after her release from jail , she changed the Rowan County license form to take the name of the county off the form – a change the plaintiffs argue violates the judge ’ s order .
“ Kim Davis gives religious liberty a bad name , and endangers it for everybody , ” says Professor Laycock , a religious liberty expert at the University of Virginia Law School in Charlottesville . “ She does not have to issue marriage licenses . But the county is not entitled to exemption , because the county does not have a religion . That ’ s the fundamental distinction . ”
Those nuances may have been lost on the pope , Mr. Laycock suggests .
“ If you come here from Rome , if you ’ re not closely following this , you don ’ t have any sort of deep understanding of US law , ” he says .
The pontiff made waves in the US during his visit for his attempt to expand the Catholic church ’ s influence beyond the culture wars . He weighed in on climate change and the death penalty , bolstering his bona fides among US liberals . But he also buckled down on church doctrine on abortion and threats to the sanctity of marriage , to the applause of conservatives .
“ I can ’ t have in mind all the cases that can exist about conscientious objection , ” the pope said on the papal plane last week , “ but yes , I can say that conscientious objection is a right that is a part of every human right . It is a right . ”
“ And if a person does not allow others to be a conscientious objector , he denies a right , ” he said , adding , in what may have been a reference to Davis , “ It is a human right , and if a government official is a human person , he has that right . ”
For American political operatives , the pope ’ s message may ultimately be frustrating for its nuance . And that may be just fine with the pontiff . As Elizabeth Buerlin writes in the New Republic , “ Pope Francis maintains a conservative position on the morality of marriage , and he is concerned for Christians who find their practice constrained by law . But he has also emphasized openness toward LGBT Catholics , famously asking , when queried about gay Catholics , ‘ Who am I to judge ? ’ ”
In that way , she writes , Francis has , at least until now , shied away from directly engaging “ the psychodrama of the American culture wars . ”
But by meeting with Davis privately , the pope , at the very least , showed a willingness to take a stand on religious liberty , even if it tarnished his message in the eyes of some Americans .
“ The news that Pope Francis met privately ... with Kim Davis throws a wet blanket on the good will that the pontiff had garnered during his US visit , ” Francis DeBernardo , executive director of gay and lesbian Catholic advocacy group New Ways Ministry , told Reuters in an e-mail .

At the same time , some Americans said the visit may have helped humanize a polarizing figure in the struggle between deeply-felt religious beliefs and the equally deep desire by many gay Americans to marry .

Pity Pope Francis!

He washes the feet of the poor, talks of forgiveness and stresses care of the planet. He even tries to lead by example, rejecting the Vatican's more opulent digs and fancy vestments. Yet Francis elicits a confusing mix of emotions. Love. Admiration. Scorn. And fear.

Yes, fear.

Democrats call that a fantasy,2019-03-16,,"WASHINGTON – When Democrats argued about a House member 's comments on Israel and U.S. lawmakers , many saw it as an emerging dispute between the party 's old guard and some of its younger members .
President Donald Trump saw it as a political opportunity with Jewish voters .
In tweets , public statements and speeches to supporters , Trump and his aides are trying to use claims of anti-Semitism to pry Jewish voters away from their longtime allegiance to the Democratic Party .
In his latest effort , a Friday morning tweet , Trump said Jewish people were leaving the Democratic Party in what he called a `` Jexodus , '' though he did not cite evidence for such a shift . He said Republicans were `` waiting with open arms '' for Jewish voters . `` Remember Jerusalem ( U.S. Embassy ) and the horrible Iran Nuclear Deal ! '' he tweeted .
The phrase `` Jexodus '' stirred controversy on Twitter with some users calling it offensive to Jewish people .
Democrats increased their share of the Jewish vote between the 2016 and 2018 elections , from 71 percent to 79 percent . A new Gallup report , based on tracking poll data from 2018 , said that `` one in six U.S. Jews identify as Republican . '' About half described themselves as Democrats .
`` 'Jexodus ' is a Republican fantasy that will fail , '' said Halie Soifer , executive director of the Jewish Democratic Council of America . Soifer was among many who said they were offended by Trump 's term .
Divide and attract – it 's a familiar tactic for the politically aggressive president who has also tried to woo members of other familiar Democratic constituencies , including women and African-Americans .
`` He 's always stirring the pot , '' said Stuart Rothenberg , senior editor at the Inside Elections newsletter .
Trump 's efforts to paint the Democratic party as anti-Jewish came after tweets and comments by freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar , D-Minn. , who suggested that pro-Israel lobbying groups controlled U.S. lawmakers through political money .
While some Democrats said the remarks played into anti-Semitic slurs about how Jewish money controls American politics , Omar said they were `` not intended to offend my constituents or Jewish Americans as a whole . '' Several Democrats said Omar was being attacked unfairly .
Seeking to foment Democratic discord , Trump issued a March 5 tweet that described Omar 's `` terrible comments '' as `` a dark day for Israel ! ''
Three days later , after a fractious House debate over a resolution condemning hate , Trump raised the stakes while speaking with reporters as he left the White House on a weekend trip to Florida , describing the Democrats as an `` anti-Israel party . ''
`` They 've become an anti-Jewish party and that 's too bad , '' he said while en route to Alabama to review tornado damage .
During his weekend in Florida , Trump reportedly went even further : The website Axios reported the president told donors during a fundraiser at this Mar-a-Lago estate that `` the Democrats hate Jewish people . ''
Jesse Lehrich , a foreign-policy spokesman for 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton , said Trump 's attacks ring hollow from a man who spoke sympathetically of some of the white supremacists who held a 2017 march in Charlottesville , Virginia .
`` American Jews overwhelmingly vote Democratic , and a brazen attempt to weaponize anti-Semitism by a man who has mainstreamed bigotry seems like a bad way to win them over , '' Lehrich said .
Matthew Brooks , executive director of the Republican Jewish Coalition , said `` there 's a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of support '' among Jewish voters for what Trump is doing , though he has not seen any new polling on the question .
Brooks also said Trump is appealing to Jewish donors and was `` smart to do so . ''
In terms of elections , Jewish voters have remained overwhelmingly Democratic during the Trump political era .
According to exit polling conducted for a consortium of news organizations for the 2016 election , Clinton defeated Trump 71 percent to 24 percent among Jewish voters . In last year 's congressional elections , according to those exit polls , Jews broke for Democratic candidates over Republican ones by 79 percent to 17 percent .
While Jewish voters are a small part of the electorate – 3 percent in 2016 ; 2 percent in 2018 – they are a significant segment in key swing states like Florida and Pennsylvania . That 's why the the Trump campaign , and the Democrats , are making a concerted effort to attract them .
Soifer , the executive director of the Jewish Democratic Council of America , cited the drop-off of Jewish support for Republicans in the 2018 midterm elections to say that Trump and the GOP are losing traction with these voters .
Many voters know that Trump has appeared to welcome support from white supremacists who have also engaged in anti-Semitism , Soifer said : `` There is what he tweets and then there is reality . ''
A Gallup report released Thursday said that , according to 2018 data , 52 percent of Jewish-Americans described themselves as Democrats , while only 16 percent identified themselves as Republicans . Among Jewish respondents , 26 percent approved of Trump 's performance as president ; 71 percent disapproved .
Gallup added : `` With Jewish Americans representing about 2 % of the U.S. population , most opinion polls do not have enough Jewish respondents in a single poll to report reliable estimates for the group . ''
Aides said Trump will continue pursuing Jewish votes as he seeks re-election in 2020 . `` The long history of anti-Semitism from Ilhan Omar and the failure of House Democrats to take appropriate action in response has shown all Americans that Democrats stand squarely with their radical left base , '' said Michael Glassner , the campaign 's chief operating officer .
Trump 's basic argument , a claim that Democrats have failed a longtime constituency , is one he has used with other groups of voters , particularly African-Americans – and there is evidence he is having success .
According to a YouGov daily tracking poll released Monday , 15 percent of African-Americans somewhat or strongly approved of the president 's job performance – still low but better than his election numbers . Trump carried only 8 percent the African-American vote in 2016 , according to exit polls .
Rothenberg , the senior editor at Inside Elections , said there is no doubt some Democrats are uncomfortable with some of the new voices in the Democratic Party , but there are also some uncomfortable with Trump and how he `` goes overboard '' with his `` stream-of-consciousness aggression . ''
`` Could it move a handful of Jewish votes ? Yeah , I guess it could , '' Rothenberg said . `` But , on the other hand , Trump is very simplistic ... He is a very polarizing figure . ''","David Jackson

WASHINGTON – When Democrats argued about a House member's comments on Israel and U.S. lawmakers, many saw it as an emerging dispute between the party's old guard and some of its younger members.

President Donald Trump saw it as a political opportunity with Jewish voters.

In his latest effort, a Friday morning tweet, Trump said Jewish people were leaving the Democratic Party in what he called a ""Jexodus,"" though he did not cite evidence for such a shift. He said Republicans were ""waiting with open arms"" for Jewish voters. ""Remember Jerusalem (U.S. Embassy) and the horrible Iran Nuclear Deal!"" he tweeted.

The phrase ""Jexodus"" stirred controversy on Twitter with some users calling it offensive to Jewish people.

Democrats increased their share of the Jewish vote between the 2016 and 2018 elections, from 71 percent to 79 percent. A new Gallup report, based on tracking poll data from 2018, said that ""one in six U.S. Jews identify as Republican."" About half described themselves as Democrats.

""'Jexodus' is a Republican fantasy that will fail,"" said Halie Soifer, executive director of the Jewish Democratic Council of America. Soifer was among many who said they were offended by Trump's term.

Divide and attract – it's a familiar tactic for the politically aggressive president who has also tried to woo members of other familiar Democratic constituencies, including women and African-Americans.

""He's always stirring the pot,"" said Stuart Rothenberg, senior editor at the Inside Elections newsletter.

Trump's efforts to paint the Democratic party as anti-Jewish came after tweets and comments by freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., who suggested that pro-Israel lobbying groups controlled U.S. lawmakers through political money.

While some Democrats said the remarks played into anti-Semitic slurs about how Jewish money controls American politics, Omar said they were ""not intended to offend my constituents or Jewish Americans as a whole."" Several Democrats said Omar was being attacked unfairly.

Trump, meanwhile, went on offense.

Seeking to foment Democratic discord, Trump issued a March 5 tweet that described Omar's ""terrible comments"" as ""a dark day for Israel!""

Three days later, after a fractious House debate over a resolution condemning hate, Trump raised the stakes while speaking with reporters as he left the White House on a weekend trip to Florida, describing the Democrats as an ""anti-Israel party.""

""They've become an anti-Jewish party and that's too bad,"" he said while en route to Alabama to review tornado damage.

During his weekend in Florida, Trump reportedly went even further: The website Axios reported the president told donors during a fundraiser at this Mar-a-Lago estate that ""the Democrats hate Jewish people.""

Jesse Lehrich, a foreign-policy spokesman for 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, said Trump's attacks ring hollow from a man who spoke sympathetically of some of the white supremacists who held a 2017 march in Charlottesville, Virginia.

""American Jews overwhelmingly vote Democratic, and a brazen attempt to weaponize anti-Semitism by a man who has mainstreamed bigotry seems like a bad way to win them over,"" Lehrich said.

Matthew Brooks, executive director of the Republican Jewish Coalition, said ""there's a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of support"" among Jewish voters for what Trump is doing, though he has not seen any new polling on the question.

""Everything at this point is anecdotal,"" he said.

Brooks also said Trump is appealing to Jewish donors and was ""smart to do so.""

In terms of elections, Jewish voters have remained overwhelmingly Democratic during the Trump political era.

According to exit polling conducted for a consortium of news organizations for the 2016 election, Clinton defeated Trump 71 percent to 24 percent among Jewish voters. In last year's congressional elections, according to those exit polls, Jews broke for Democratic candidates over Republican ones by 79 percent to 17 percent.

While Jewish voters are a small part of the electorate – 3 percent in 2016; 2 percent in 2018 – they are a significant segment in key swing states like Florida and Pennsylvania. That's why the the Trump campaign, and the Democrats, are making a concerted effort to attract them.

Soifer, the executive director of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, cited the drop-off of Jewish support for Republicans in the 2018 midterm elections to say that Trump and the GOP are losing traction with these voters.

Many voters know that Trump has appeared to welcome support from white supremacists who have also engaged in anti-Semitism, Soifer said: ""There is what he tweets and then there is reality.""

A Gallup report released Thursday said that, according to 2018 data, 52 percent of Jewish-Americans described themselves as Democrats, while only 16 percent identified themselves as Republicans. Among Jewish respondents, 26 percent approved of Trump's performance as president; 71 percent disapproved.

Gallup added: ""With Jewish Americans representing about 2% of the U.S. population, most opinion polls do not have enough Jewish respondents in a single poll to report reliable estimates for the group.""

Aides said Trump will continue pursuing Jewish votes as he seeks re-election in 2020. ""The long history of anti-Semitism from Ilhan Omar and the failure of House Democrats to take appropriate action in response has shown all Americans that Democrats stand squarely with their radical left base,"" said Michael Glassner, the campaign's chief operating officer.

Trump's basic argument, a claim that Democrats have failed a longtime constituency, is one he has used with other groups of voters, particularly African-Americans – and there is evidence he is having success.

According to a YouGov daily tracking poll released Monday, 15 percent of African-Americans somewhat or strongly approved of the president's job performance – still low but better than his election numbers. Trump carried only 8 percent the African-American vote in 2016, according to exit polls.

Rothenberg, the senior editor at Inside Elections, said there is no doubt some Democrats are uncomfortable with some of the new voices in the Democratic Party, but there are also some uncomfortable with Trump and how he ""goes overboard"" with his ""stream-of-consciousness aggression.""

""Could it move a handful of Jewish votes? Yeah, I guess it could,"" Rothenberg said. ""But, on the other hand, Trump is very simplistic ... He is a very polarizing figure.""",www.usatoday.com,center,dUkwJdbe0Vz4RgC7

International Christian Concern ( ICC ) , a Christian persecution watchdog group , reports the ruling handed down by a two-judge panel is in direct opposition to the Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Act which forbids marriage below the age of 18 .
The ruling came during the latest court hearing into the kidnapping , forced conversion and marriage of Huma Younus , a 14-year-old Christian girl .
As ███ News reported , Younus was kidnapped by three men from her home in Karachi last October . The men waited on her parents to leave the house before forcibly taking the young girl . She was reportedly taken to Dera Gazi Khan , a city in the Punjab province of Pakistan , more than 370 miles from her home .
Since then , the girl 's parents have been doing everything they can to recover their daughter .
Younus ' parents received documents from the abductors a few days after she was taken , including papers showing her alleged conversion to Islam and a marriage certificate . The girl 's mother Nagina said the papers are fake because the date on documents was the same as the day when her daughter was abducted .
In an effort to rescue their daughter , the family argued the marriage to a man named Jabbar was invalid under the Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Act . The Christian couple supplied the court with baptismal and school documents proving Huma is 14 , according to the ICC . She was born on May 22 , 2005 , the Independent Catholic News reports .
The law in question was passed almost six years ago in an effort to stop forced marriages to minors in the province . The practice is prevalent among Hindus and Christian girls , according to various media outlets .
During the court hearing , judges Muhammad Iqbal Kalhoro and Irshad Ali Shah ruled that the marriage between Huma and Jabbar is valid because she has already had her first period .
`` Once again , justice has been defeated and , once again , our state has shown itself unable to treat Christians as Pakistani citizens , '' Nagheena Younus , Huma 's mother , told Aid to the Church in Need ( ACN ) .
Huma 's parents have vowed to take her case to the Supreme Court of Pakistan .
`` On February 3rd we went to the Sindh High Court but our little girl was not in the courtroom . If we do not get justice , we will address the case to the Supreme Court of Pakistan . We believe that the government and the judges are delaying the decision because our girl is 14 years old . They want to wait for her to turn 18 and then close the case , '' she explained .
Tabassum Yousaf , Younus ' lawyer , told the ACN they hoped the law could have been applied for the first time in Huma 's case .
`` But evidently in Pakistan these laws are formulated and approved only to improve the image of the country in front of the international community , ask for development funds , and freely trade Pakistani products on the European market , '' he said .
Another hearing in the case has been scheduled for March 4 .
In an email to ███ News , ICC President Jeff King responded to the court 's ruling .
`` Pakistan 's High Court decision to rule in favor of underage marriage is wrong on so many levels . In the last few years , the world has been awakened to the disastrous practice and effects of child marriage ( child brides ) through various organizations and brave female voices throughout the world , '' King wrote . `` I 've yet to see these campaigners , though , touch on one aspect of the practice that allows Christians around the world to have their daughters kidnapped , often never to be seen again . That is the issue of forced marriage and forced conversion in Muslim countries . ''
King explained that young Christian women are frequently targeted by Muslim men .
`` In the most fundamentalist Muslim countries ( ie . Pakistan , Egypt , and others ) , where Christians are a minority , young Christian girls are routinely targeted by Muslim men , '' he noted . `` It usually starts with a young Christian girl being approached by a Muslim boy or man with a request to date or marry . If these requests are ignored , she will start to hear how she 's too pretty to be a Christian and other statements that represent a more dangerous level of harassment . ''
The ICC president adds that the family usually knows the perpetrator .
`` Usually , and often tragically , the next step is that she will be kidnapped , drugged , beaten , and raped multiple times , and often the family knows who is responsible , '' King continued . `` In a fundamentalist , shame-based culture , the girl 's prospects for marriage , and a decent life , are permanently ruined . She is left feeling incredibly useless and ashamed . Then , she will be presented with an offer to save her dignity by being married to her rapist . If she refuses , she will be raped and beaten repeatedly . ''
King says Pakistani law enforcement officials are of little help to parents .
`` When the parents inquire of the police and try to get them to do something , they will be presented with a statement from their daughter saying that she has become a Muslim , '' he continued . `` If the Christian parents continue to fight , they 're often slapped around and threatened with arrest . If the parents are especially brave , the daughter is often then dragged in front of them in a drugged state ( with her torturer and rapist in the room ) to say that she is a Muslim and does n't wish to come home – never making eye contact with her parents . ''
King pointed out to ███ News that none of this is a rare occurrence , unfortunately .
`` So it is with tremendous sadness that we receive the news that Pakistan 's High Court has allowed this practice to continue . Even more tragically , it means that for 14-year-old Huma , whose case the trial was based on , will not be returned to her parents and is probably lost to them forever , '' he concluded .","A Pakistan high court has handed down a ruling based on Islamic ""sharia"" law that says men in Pakistan can marry underage girls as long as they have had their first menstrual cycle.

White House aides said the president ’ s meeting with the pope in the Oval Office on Wednesday will focus on their shared values and won ’ t address policy specifics .
“ Their focus in the context of this meeting will not be about politics , not about specific policies , but rather about the kinds of values that both men have dedicated their lives to championing , ” said White House press secretary Josh Earnest . “ There is no plan or strategy that ’ s been put in place to try to stage an event that will advance anybody ’ s political agenda . ”
Mr . Earnest , addressing the Islamic State ’ s persecution of Christians in Syria and Iraq , said one of the values that Mr. Obama shares with Pope Francis “ is a commitment to religious liberty — standing up for the rights of religious minorities around the world . ”
“ That has long been a value that President Obama has prioritized , ” he said .
Whether or not it was timed to coincide with the pope ’ s arrival , HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell gave a speech Tuesday at Howard University ’ s College of Medicine on progress made under the Affordable Care Act .
The Supreme Court is increasingly likely to take up one or more challenges to the Obamacare contraception mandate . A panel of the 8th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis ruled last week that forcing two Missouri organizations to offer contraceptive coverage to employees — even indirectly — would violate the groups ’ religious freedoms .
Every other appeals court to consider the issue has ruled in opposition to the 8th Circuit , and the Supreme Court usually steps in to resolve such splits . The other courts have said the administration has done enough to accommodate the objections of religiously affiliated nonprofit organizations such as universities , hospitals and charities .
The Becket Fund ’ s petitions to the high court involve the Little Sisters of the Poor and Houston Baptist University , both of which are challenging the mandate on religious grounds . The court is expected to decide in October whether to hear one or more of the cases .
“ I think it ’ s unlikely that the court would refuse to address the issue , which is affecting hundreds if not thousands of religious organizations across the country , ” Mr. Baxter said .
“ The administration shouldn ’ t be picking and choosing between religious organizations . The bishops who run the dioceses around the country have been exempted from the mandate , there ’ s no reason why the nuns , like Little Sisters of the Poor , or other religious organizations shouldn ’ t also be exempt , ” he said .","Pope Francis is arriving in the U.S. at a time when the faithful are facing broad challenges in court over the limits of religious liberty.

“That has long been a value that President Obama has prioritized,” he said.

Whether or not it was timed to coincide with the pope’s arrival, HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell gave a speech Tuesday at Howard University’s College of Medicine on progress made under the Affordable Care Act.

The Supreme Court is increasingly likely to take up one or more challenges to the Obamacare contraception mandate. A panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis ruled last week that forcing two Missouri organizations to offer contraceptive coverage to employees — even indirectly — would violate the groups’ religious freedoms.

Every other appeals court to consider the issue has ruled in opposition to the 8th Circuit, and the Supreme Court usually steps in to resolve such splits. The other courts have said the administration has done enough to accommodate the objections of religiously affiliated nonprofit organizations such as universities, hospitals and charities.

The Becket Fund’s petitions to the high court involve the Little Sisters of the Poor and Houston Baptist University, both of which are challenging the mandate on religious grounds. The court is expected to decide in October whether to hear one or more of the cases.

“I think it’s unlikely that the court would refuse to address the issue, which is affecting hundreds if not thousands of religious organizations across the country,” Mr. Baxter said.

“The administration shouldn’t be picking and choosing between religious organizations. The bishops who run the dioceses around the country have been exempted from the mandate, there’s no reason why the nuns, like Little Sisters of the Poor, or other religious organizations shouldn’t also be exempt,” he said.

Remarkably , he found that in response to the question , “ Which of these do you think most likely describes what Obama believes deep down ? Muslim , Christian , atheist , spiritual , or I don ’ t know , ” 54 percent of Republicans said Obama is Muslim . Only nine percent said he is Christian .
Writing at the Washington Post ’ s Monkey Cage blog , Theodoridis elaborated :
The percentage selecting “ Muslim ” is notably higher than in other polls conducted on this topic . This difference likely depends on how the question is phrased . Previous survey questions about Obama ’ s religion tend to sound like a pop quiz — such as “ do you happen to know the religious faith of Barack Obama ? ” But by asking “ what Obama believes deep down ? ” I was intentionally granting respondents license to stray from the pesident ’ s self-reported Christian faith . This reveals a prevalent willingness to distrust this pesident or categorize him as “ the other ” in terms of religion . Of course , respondents could also be “ cheerleading ” — using a survey question to express their general dislike of Obama rather than a genuine view about his religious faith . But , if these results were largely driven by anti-Obama cheerleading , we should expect more respondents , especially Republicans , to choose the very unpopular category of “ atheist. ” Relatively few do so .
Previous ruminations on the Obama-is-a-secret-Muslim theme have suggested various sources for it : ignorance , Fox News , racism , too much World Net Daily in your diet .
Theodoridis ’ post was inspired by Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker ’ s remarks that he didn ’ t know whether Obama is a Christian . But do other elected Republicans suggest that Obama is not only not a Christian , but a Muslim ? I ran a search in the Congressional Record for recent floor speeches in which the word Islam or Islamic and the President appear . This is snapshot , of course , and the number of constituents who actually listen to these speeches is infinitesimal . But if elected Republicans aren ’ t afraid to question Obama ’ s religious commitments for the permanent record , think of what they might say to constituents in smaller settings , or the well that they are drawing from when they make remarks in Congressional sessions for which they receive no pushback , and in fact receive encouragement .
Republicans drew from recent conservative complaints that Obama refuses to say that Islamic State and other terrorist groups are “ Islamic , ” that he doesn ’ t take the threat of terrorism seriously , and he is insufficiently protective of American exceptionalism .
On February 24 , 2015 , Rep. Mark Walker ( R-NC ) said on the House floor that his constituents “ shared with me their frustration at the ambiguous language from this administration in describing the evils of radical Islamist terrorism , ” and that he himself has “ grown weary at the timidity ” of Obama , who “ continues to be defensive , at best. ” He went on :
At first glance , the silence appears to be passive or poor leadership . But I am inclined to believe that the President ’ s posture is not one of weakness but , rather , an intentional directive in both rhetoric and action . It appears that his promise to take our country in a fundamentally new direction is being played out in realtime . Instead of defending our liberty and our way of life , which is the most charitable in the world , our President seems to scoff at the belief that our country has been uniquely blessed by God . I would be remiss today if I did not pause and remember our Egyptian Christian brothers in the recent barbaric attacks in Libya . ISIS murdered innocent husbands and fathers who clearly died for their faith and their beliefs . Just this morning , we hear further reports out of Syria that Islamic State militants have abducted dozens of Christians , including women and children . Weeks prior , the President chastised the Christian community for getting on their judgmental high horses . Yet , in describing our martyred brothers from Egypt , the President refused to even utter the word , “ Christian. ” The undermining of our beliefs has become an issue with this President .
Contrary to Walker ’ s statement , which echoes a claim circulating in conservative circles that Obama did not identify the Coptic victims of the Islamic State massacre as Christians , at last week ’ s summit on countering religious extremism , Obama noted that that Islamic State ’ s “ slaughter of EgyptianChristians in Libya has shocked the world. ” Notice , in Walker ’ s speech , the juxtaposition of the statement that Obama “ seems to scoff at the belief that our country has been uniquely blessed by God ” ( i.e. , he ’ s not a Christian ) with his own remembrance of the murdered Egyptian Christians “ who clearly died for their faith and their beliefs . ”
Some of the floor statements come from ardent Christian supporters of Israel , who contrast Obama negatively with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .
In a February 5 , 2015 floor speech , Rep. Trent Franks ( R-AZ ) called Netanyahu “ one of the most prescient voices that we have in the entire world to address some of the subjects and some of the dangers that face the United States of America. ” In contrast , Franks claimed , Obama “ chooses to listen to these mysterious voices of those who did not vote in our Nation ’ s election , ” yet “ has sought to go after and silence ” Netanyahu . ( He did not specify whose “ mysterious voices ” were whispering in Obama ’ s ear . ) Franks questioned whether Obama is “ so naive or , worse , so arrogant as to believe that we can have any type of credible , diplomatic agreement ” with Iran .
Rep. Ted Poe ( R-TX ) , in February 2 , 2015 floor remarks , asked , “ this administration also refuses to say that we are at war with radical Islam . There is so much sensitivity in the White House over its statements that one is puzzled to wonder : Why are they sensitive about calling terrorists ‘ terrorists ? ' ”
The next day in a floor speech , Rep. Louie Gohmert ( R-TX ) , after describing atrocities committed by terrorists , added , “ I guess if you are part of this administration , you shouldn ’ t consider that to be all that radical because this administration , under their watch , with Commander in Chief Barack Obama , had orders given to remove crosses from the chapels on our military installations. ” ( Gohmert repeats this claim , despite it having been debunked in 2013 ; the military , according to FactCheck.org , “ has a longstanding policy against permanent religious symbols being attached to military chapels. ” ) In the speech , two days before the National Prayer Breakfast , Gohmert noted Obama ’ s upcoming appearance , adding , “ I am greatly appreciative of the President ’ s espoused faith. ” ( emphasis mine ) .
In a January 14 , 2015 stemwinder , after laying out a litany of Obama ’ s alleged sins in failing to recognizing “ that radical Islam is a threat to our very existence and way of life , ” Gohmert delivered a brief lecture on how Christians are supposed to act ( and govern ) :
I have Christian friends that say : Yes , but as Christians , we are supposed to turn the other cheek . That is as individuals . Individual Christians should live out the beatitudes as Christ gave them . But the government has a different role . If you do evil , you should be afraid because the government , within the bounds of Christianity–Romans 13:4–is supposed to punish the evil , eliminate the evils , and protect your people . I don ’ t try to convert anybody using my position in government , but for those who misunderstand Christian teaching , you need to read Romans 13 .
Romans 13 is about submission to governmental authority , and the particular verse Gohmert cited reads : “ For the one in authority is God ’ s servant for your good . But if you do wrong , be afraid , for rulers do not bear the sword for no reason . They are God ’ s servants , agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer. ” In other words , Obama isn ’ t punishing ( purportedly Islamic ) wrongdoers ; he therefore doesn ’ t understand what Gohmert believes to be biblical imperatives for governing . Draw your own conclusions .
Of course Poe , Franks , and Gohmert represent the far right flank of their party , but their fellow Republicans don ’ t dispute them .

That 's the top finding — one that will ricochet through American faith , culture and politics — in the Pew Research Center 's newest report , `` America 's Changing Religious Landscape , '' released Tuesday .
This trend `` is big , it 's broad and it 's everywhere , '' said Alan Cooperman , Pew 's director of religion research .
Christianity still dominates American religious identity ( 70 % ) , but the survey shows dramatic shifts as more people move out the doors of denominations , shedding spiritual connections along the way .
Atheists and agnostics have nearly doubled their share of the religious marketplace , and overall indifference to religion of any sort is rising as well . Only the historically black Protestant churches have held a steady grip through the years of change .
Remember the familiar map of American religion ? The South : A bastion of white evangelicals . The Northeast : Cradle of Catholics . The Midwest : Nest of Mainline Protestants . The West : Incubator of `` nones '' — people who claim no religious brand label .
The shrinking numbers of Christians and their loss of market share is the most significant change since 2007 ( when Pew did its first U.S . Religious Landscape survey ) and the new , equally massive survey of 35,000 U.S. adults .

WASHINGTON — The United States is a significantly less Christian country than it was seven years ago.

That's the top finding — one that will ricochet through American faith, culture and politics — in the Pew Research Center's newest report, ""America's Changing Religious Landscape,"" released Tuesday.

This trend ""is big, it's broad and it's everywhere,"" said Alan Cooperman, Pew's director of religion research.

Christianity still dominates American religious identity (70%), but the survey shows dramatic shifts as more people move out the doors of denominations, shedding spiritual connections along the way.

Atheists and agnostics have nearly doubled their share of the religious marketplace, and overall indifference to religion of any sort is rising as well. Only the historically black Protestant churches have held a steady grip through the years of change.

Remember the familiar map of American religion? The South: A bastion of white evangelicals. The Northeast: Cradle of Catholics. The Midwest: Nest of Mainline Protestants. The West: Incubator of ""nones"" — people who claim no religious brand label.

Well, scratch all that in the new topography.

The shrinking numbers of Christians and their loss of market share is the most significant change since 2007 (when Pew did its first U.S. Religious Landscape survey) and the new, equally massive survey of 35,000 U.S. adults.

The percentage of people who describe themselves as Christians fell about 8 points — from 78.4% to 70.6%. This includes people in virtually all demographic groups, whether they are ""nearing retirement or just entering adulthood, married or single, living in the West or the Bible Belt,"" according to the survey report.

State by state and regional data show:

Massachusetts is down on Catholics by 10 percentage points. South Carolina is down the same degree on evangelicals. Mainline Protestants, already sliding for 40 years or more, declined all over the Midwest by 3 to 4 percentage points.The Southern Baptist Convention and the United Methodist Church, the country's two largest Protestant denominations, are each down roughly the same 1.4 to 1.5 percentage points.Every tradition took a hit in in the West as the number of people who claim no religious brand continues to climb.

Christian faiths are troubled by generational change — each successive group is less connected than their parents — and by ""switching"" at all ages, the report shows. While nearly 86% of Americans say they grew up as Christians, nearly one in five (19%) say they aren't so anymore.

""Overall, there are more than four former Christians for every convert to Christianity,"" said Cooperman.

Although evangelicals are part of the decline, their slide has been less steep. They benefit from more people joining evangelical traditions, but they're hurt by generational change and by America's increased diversity.

According to the survey, white ""born-again or evangelical"" Protestants — closely watched for their political clout within the GOP — now account for 19% of American adults, down slightly from 21% in 2007.

Politicians should take note, said Mike Hout, a sociologist and demographer at New York University who is also a co-director of the General Social Survey.

""Traditionally, we thought religion was the mover and politics were the consequence,"" he said. Today, it's the opposite.

Many of today's formerly faithful left conservative evangelical or Catholic denominations because ""they saw them align with a conservative political agenda and they don't want to be identified with that,"" Hout said.

Catholics dropped both in market share and in real numbers. Despite their high retention rate for people reared in the faith, they have a low conversion rate. Today, Cooperman said, 13% of U.S. adults are former Catholics, up from 10% in 2007.

Generational shifts are also hurting Catholic numbers. Greg Smith, Pew's associate director of research, said ""just 16% of the 18-to-24-year-olds today are Catholic, and that is not enough to offset the numbers lost to the aging and switching.""

Where are they going? To religious nowhere.

The ""nones"" — Americans who are unaffiliated with brand-name religion — are the new major force in American faith. And they are more secular in outlook — and ""more comfortable admitting it"" than ever before, said John Green, director of the Bliss Institute of Applied Politics at the University of Akron.

Their growth spans the generations, as well as racial and ethnic groups, said Green, a senior fellow in religion and American politics for the Pew Research Center.

""Nones,"" at 22.8% of the U.S. (up from 16% just eight years ago) run second only to evangelicals (25.4%) and ahead of Catholics (20.8%) in religious market share.

The ""nones"" numbers are now big enough to show noteworthy diversity:

Atheists rose from 1.6% to 3.1%, and agnostics from 2.4% to 4%. Combined, there are more ""nones"" than Evangelical Lutherans, United Methodists and Episcopalians all together.

""More people know the facts, and more people realize they are not alone,"" Silverman said. And with these shifts, the stigma of coming out as an atheist is lessening.

""It's now impossible for an atheist to think he is alone in this world. They are automatically empowered,"" said Silverman.

The bulk of the ""nones"" (15.8%, up from 12.1% in 2007) don't even commit to any view on God. Instead, they say they believe ""nothing in particular.""

But among the ""nothings,"" there's a distinct split between ""spiritual"" and totally indifferent ""nones.""

Thirty percent of all ""nones"" still showed ""a sort of religious pulse"" by saying that religion is still at least somewhat important to them, said Cooperman.

However, the bulk of this group (39%) are not agnostic, atheist or vaguely spiritual — they're just not interested. Religion is not even somewhat important to them.

Other trends of note:

religion_and_faith,FiveThirtyEight,1,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-christian-right-has-a-new-strategy-on-gay-marriage/,The Christian Right Has A New Strategy On Gay Marriage,2017-12-05,Amelia Thomson-Deveaux,"The next broadside in the culture wars arrives on the Supreme Court ’ s doorstep Tuesday in the unlikely form of a Colorado bakery owner named Jack Phillips . Phillips is a devout Christian who closes his shop on Sundays and refuses to take business that he says violates his religious beliefs — including making cakes celebrating Halloween , atheism and “ any form of marriage other than between a husband and a wife. ” In doing so , he is defying his state ’ s anti-discrimination law , and the Supreme Court will now hear oral arguments on whether he has the right to do so .
The case , Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission , represents a pivotal new legal strategy for the Christian conservative movement grounded in religious liberty claims rather than arguments that the law should reflect their values . But it ’ s also a sign that the Christian right — which once professed to speak for America ’ s “ moral majority ” — is tacitly conceding a loss in its long-standing battle over gay rights . While religious conservatives have consistently cast themselves as at odds with dominant liberal , secular forces , this case indicates that they are beginning to adapt to life as a true cultural minority .
“ Christian conservatives used to try to promote traditional morality for everyone , but now there seems to be a recognition that they just aren ’ t going to win over the culture , ” said Andrew R. Lewis , a political science professor at the University of Cincinnati . “ So they ’ re going to the courts to argue that they ’ re vulnerable like other minorities and they need protections from the broader culture . ”
Resistance to gay rights was one of the Christian right ’ s earliest and most successful rallying cries , and opposition to same-sex marriage has been a galvanizing issue for the constituency since as early as 1993 , when a Hawaii court struck down a gay marriage ban and Christian conservatives rushed to implement same-sex marriage restrictions around the country .
Christian right leaders like James Dobson , Pat Robertson and Ralph Reed frequently cast Christians as a group victimized by a cabal of secular liberal elites intent on dethroning traditional religious values . But rather than seeking to carve out space for these values within the secular mainstream , as Phillips is doing , they used this rhetoric to urge Christians to help turn back the tide . This broader strategy made sense , given that opposition to gay marriage was common among religious Americans at the time , although white evangelicals ’ antagonism was particularly vehement : In 2001 , only 13 percent of white evangelicals , 30 percent of black Protestants , 38 percent of white mainline Protestants and 40 percent of Catholics were in support .
After the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court invalidated the state ’ s ban on same-sex marriage in 2003 , Christian conservatives struck back with anti-gay marriage ballot initiatives during the 2004 presidential election . But despite these short-term gains , support for same-sex marriage rose exponentially among Americans across the board over the following decade . Today , there are only three religious groups — white evangelical Protestants , Mormons and Jehovah ’ s Witnesses — where a majority of adherents oppose same-sex marriage . And the U.S. Supreme Court essentially shut down the legal paths to opposing gay marriage when it found in 2015 that gay couples have a constitutional right to marry .
So now , Phillips and his attorneys from the Alliance Defending Freedom , a conservative Christian legal organization , are making a two-pronged argument focusing on the rights of religious minorities . ( Neither has so far been persuasive in the lower courts . ) One is that forcing Phillips to bake a custom cake for a gay wedding violates his religious freedom under the free exercise clause of the First Amendment ; the other is that it violates his free speech rights as a self-described “ cake artist ” who would be forced to endorse a ceremony that he finds immoral .
Phillips ’ lawyers aren ’ t the only ones making this case . The issue of “ religious liberty ” has become an increasingly high priority for the broader conservative Christian population , particularly white evangelical Protestants , who are overwhelmingly politically conservative and traditionally seen as the core of the Christian right . Surveys by the Barna Group , a research organization that focuses on Christian trends , found that the number of evangelicals ( white and nonwhite ) who said that religious freedom in the U.S. has become restricted over the past decade rose from 60 percent in 2012 to 77 percent in 2015 . Similarly , according to the Pew Research Center , while only 18 percent of white evangelical Protestant churchgoers reported that they had heard about attacks on religious liberty from the pulpit in recent months in 2012 , a survey from 2016 found that 43 percent of white evangelicals said they had recently heard clergy speak in defense of religious liberty .
This preoccupation with religious liberty appears to have cemented evangelicals ’ conviction that they are uniquely likely to be victimized as a result of their religion : A Public Religion Research Institute survey from earlier this year found that although Americans overall were twice as likely to say there was a lot of discrimination against Muslims than they were to say there was a lot of discrimination against evangelicals ( 66 percent vs. 33 percent ) , 57 percent of white evangelical Protestants believe there is a lot of discrimination against their own group , while only 44 percent said the same for Muslims .
Many white evangelicals see themselves as targets How respondents in different religious groups view discrimination against Christians and Muslims THERE IS A LOT OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST … CHRISTIANS MUSLIMS White mainline Protestants 30 % 63 % White Catholics 26 64 White evangelical Protestants 57 44 Nonwhite Protestants 40 75 Religiously unaffiliated 23 77 All Americans 33 66 Source : Public Religion Research Institute
White evangelical Protestants are also alone among religious groups in their support for the particular religious exemptions they seek . A PRRI survey released in February found that even religious minorities that have won landmark free speech and religious liberty cases in the past , like Jehovah ’ s Witnesses ( an overwhelming majority of whom also say that homosexuality should be discouraged ) , oppose allowing small-business owners to refuse to provide products or services to gay and lesbian people . Even when asked specifically about wedding vendors in another PRRI survey , white evangelical Protestants are the only religious group in which a majority say the business owner should be allowed to refuse service to gay couples .

Steven Brown , a professor of political science at Auburn University who has studied the Christian right ’ s use of the courts , said that cases like Masterpiece Cakeshop are taking the language of rights pioneered by liberal groups over the course of the 20th century to demand even more sweeping protections for religious groups than courts have granted in the past .
“ This is very different from other cases , where you had Jehovah ’ s Witnesses saying they couldn ’ t be forced to say the Pledge of Allegiance in schools , ” he said . It ’ s also a separate situation , Brown said , from instances when Christians argued that a public school or state university violated their free speech rights by restricting the activities of religious student clubs , since “ those are government actors and the purpose of the First Amendment is to protect citizens from government overreach . ”
“ The question here is whether a Christian baker who purports to serve the public gets those protections , ” Brown said . “ That could lead to a dangerous place where anyone can essentially say , ‘ I won ’ t serve your kind . ’ ”
And then there ’ s the question of whether “ religious liberty ” is merely a cover for anti-LGBT discrimination — as some have contended — or whether with cases like Masterpiece Cakeshop , Christian conservatives are shifting to a strategy based on religious pluralism .
It turns out that both may be true . Barna ’ s polling shows that evangelicals are increasingly concerned about protecting their own values and way of life , even at the expense of others ’ : The number of evangelicals who agree that traditional Judeo-Christian values must be given preference in the U.S. rose from 54 percent in 2012 to 76 percent in 2015 , while the number of evangelicals who agree that no one set of values should dominate the country declined from 37 percent to 25 percent over the same period .
But Lewis ’ research also indicates that as they come to terms with their own status as a cultural minority , Christian conservatives may be more accepting of other groups ’ First Amendment rights . In a recent book , Lewis developed a scale to measure support for free speech claims by various unpopular groups and found that evangelicals ’ support rose significantly between 1976 and 2012 .
Along with other political scientists , he also devised an experiment to measure whether exposure to claims about religious rights ( like wedding vendors ’ ability to opt out of same-sex weddings ) increased respondents ’ tolerance in general . He found that after being presented with arguments for religious exemptions , white evangelical Protestants reported more favorable views of groups like Muslims and atheists . “ As they begin to make their own rights claims , it seems that evangelicals may actually become more tolerant of other groups , ” Lewis said .
Regardless of how the Supreme Court rules in this case , the struggle over religious exemptions won ’ t end anytime soon . Some legal scholars have already argued that although a baker ’ s participation in a wedding ceremony may not be significant enough to trigger a free speech exemption , a wedding photographer or singer might have a better case . And even if Phillips wins , future litigation will likely be needed to work out exactly who can claim religious exemptions , and from which laws .
“ Even with Republicans in power in Washington , Christian conservatives have lost one of their biggest battles , ” said Daniel Williams , a professor at the University of West Georgia who studies the Christian right . “ At issue in this case now is just how much of their agenda they ’ ll be able to preserve . ”","The next broadside in the culture wars arrives on the Supreme Court’s doorstep Tuesday in the unlikely form of a Colorado bakery owner named Jack Phillips. Phillips is a devout Christian who closes his shop on Sundays and refuses to take business that he says violates his religious beliefs — including making cakes celebrating Halloween, atheism and “any form of marriage other than between a husband and a wife.” In doing so, he is defying his state’s anti-discrimination law, and the Supreme Court will now hear oral arguments on whether he has the right to do so.

The case, Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, represents a pivotal new legal strategy for the Christian conservative movement grounded in religious liberty claims rather than arguments that the law should reflect their values. But it’s also a sign that the Christian right — which once professed to speak for America’s “moral majority” — is tacitly conceding a loss in its long-standing battle over gay rights. While religious conservatives have consistently cast themselves as at odds with dominant liberal, secular forces, this case indicates that they are beginning to adapt to life as a true cultural minority.

“Christian conservatives used to try to promote traditional morality for everyone, but now there seems to be a recognition that they just aren’t going to win over the culture,” said Andrew R. Lewis, a political science professor at the University of Cincinnati. “So they’re going to the courts to argue that they’re vulnerable like other minorities and they need protections from the broader culture.”

Resistance to gay rights was one of the Christian right’s earliest and most successful rallying cries, and opposition to same-sex marriage has been a galvanizing issue for the constituency since as early as 1993, when a Hawaii court struck down a gay marriage ban and Christian conservatives rushed to implement same-sex marriage restrictions around the country.

Christian right leaders like James Dobson, Pat Robertson and Ralph Reed frequently cast Christians as a group victimized by a cabal of secular liberal elites intent on dethroning traditional religious values. But rather than seeking to carve out space for these values within the secular mainstream, as Phillips is doing, they used this rhetoric to urge Christians to help turn back the tide. This broader strategy made sense, given that opposition to gay marriage was common among religious Americans at the time, although white evangelicals’ antagonism was particularly vehement: In 2001, only 13 percent of white evangelicals, 30 percent of black Protestants, 38 percent of white mainline Protestants and 40 percent of Catholics were in support.

After the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court invalidated the state’s ban on same-sex marriage in 2003, Christian conservatives struck back with anti-gay marriage ballot initiatives during the 2004 presidential election. But despite these short-term gains, support for same-sex marriage rose exponentially among Americans across the board over the following decade. Today, there are only three religious groups — white evangelical Protestants, Mormons and Jehovah’s Witnesses — where a majority of adherents oppose same-sex marriage. And the U.S. Supreme Court essentially shut down the legal paths to opposing gay marriage when it found in 2015 that gay couples have a constitutional right to marry.

So now, Phillips and his attorneys from the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal organization, are making a two-pronged argument focusing on the rights of religious minorities. (Neither has so far been persuasive in the lower courts.) One is that forcing Phillips to bake a custom cake for a gay wedding violates his religious freedom under the free exercise clause of the First Amendment; the other is that it violates his free speech rights as a self-described “cake artist” who would be forced to endorse a ceremony that he finds immoral.

Phillips’ lawyers aren’t the only ones making this case. The issue of “religious liberty” has become an increasingly high priority for the broader conservative Christian population, particularly white evangelical Protestants, who are overwhelmingly politically conservative and traditionally seen as the core of the Christian right. Surveys by the Barna Group, a research organization that focuses on Christian trends, found that the number of evangelicals (white and nonwhite) who said that religious freedom in the U.S. has become restricted over the past decade rose from 60 percent in 2012 to 77 percent in 2015. Similarly, according to the Pew Research Center, while only 18 percent of white evangelical Protestant churchgoers reported that they had heard about attacks on religious liberty from the pulpit in recent months in 2012, a survey from 2016 found that 43 percent of white evangelicals said they had recently heard clergy speak in defense of religious liberty.

This preoccupation with religious liberty appears to have cemented evangelicals’ conviction that they are uniquely likely to be victimized as a result of their religion: A Public Religion Research Institute survey from earlier this year found that although Americans overall were twice as likely to say there was a lot of discrimination against Muslims than they were to say there was a lot of discrimination against evangelicals (66 percent vs. 33 percent), 57 percent of white evangelical Protestants believe there is a lot of discrimination against their own group, while only 44 percent said the same for Muslims.

White evangelical Protestants are also alone among religious groups in their support for the particular religious exemptions they seek. A PRRI survey released in February found that even religious minorities that have won landmark free speech and religious liberty cases in the past, like Jehovah’s Witnesses (an overwhelming majority of whom also say that homosexuality should be discouraged), oppose allowing small-business owners to refuse to provide products or services to gay and lesbian people.

More On This... Pope Francis’ unexpected Hanukkah gift

Just like President Obama loved apologizing for America, Pope Francis likes to apologize for the Catholic Church, thinking that the Church is at its best when it is passive and not offending anyone’s sensibilities.

In his interviews with those in the left-wing media he seeks to impress, Francis has said that the Church needs to stop being ‘obsessed’ with abortion and gay marriage, and instead of seeking to convert people, “we need to get to know each other, listen to each other and improve our knowledge of the world around us.”

This softly-softly approach of not making a fuss has been tried before, and failed. The Second Vatican Council of the 1960’s aimed to “open the windows” of the Church to the modern world by doing just this.

The result was the Catholic version of New Coke. Across the West where the effects were felt, seminaries and convents emptied, church attendance plummeted, and adherence to Church doctrine diminished.

John Paul II and Benedict XVI worked hard to turn this trend around, but now Pope Francis wants the bad old days to resume.

Proof of this is Francis’ aforementioned statement of the Church being obsessed with controversial issues and the need to rebalance by talking about it less.

That Francis didn’t see that this would be translated into headlines of “Pope tells Catholics to shut up about things that offend Sandra Fluke” by every left-wing media outlet shows a terrifying naivety.

Nor do his comments reflect reality.

For years, the majority of priests didn't dare cover controversial topics in their homilies in fear of getting angry letters from pick-and-choose Catholics outraged that their pastor dared to say something out of line with the Democratic Party.

Most parishioners therefore haven’t heard the Church’s argument on controversial topics. Consequently, usage of contraception is only slightly lower in Catholics than in the general population, and support of gay marriage is actually higher in Catholics than the general population. Perhaps talking about it even less isn’t the answer?

In trying to please the media and the modern world, Francis mistakes their glee for respect. Just like Obama thought he’d won over Putin by promising a reset, Francis thinks by talking vacuously about the poor, he will be respected. And it is vacuous -- the pontiff recently asked why it’s news that the stock market drops but not when an old person dies. When your leader is asking, “Why isn’t the newspaper a laundry list of obituaries?” you know you elected the wrong guy.

What effect is this having? For all we’re being told about how ‘disenfranchised’ Catholics are being brought back by Francis ‘reaching out,’ a recent Pew Research study showed that in America, the number of people who identify as Catholic has actually decreased. Lesson: rubbing the egos of Church-hating left-wingers doesn’t make more Catholics, it just makes the Church less respected.

Francis not only panders to enemies and professional grievance mongers, but also attacks his allies. Just as Obama snubs Britain and Israel, Pope Francis swipes at practicing Catholics.

On world matters, Francis’ statements are embarrassing. About communism, a destructive ideology that slaughtered millions of Catholics, he said:

Not such kind words for the free market, however. In his recent apostolic exhortation he slammed unfettered capitalism, calling it ‘a new tyranny.’

Apart from the fact that there is no major nation practicing unfettered capitalism (like Obama, Francis loves attacking straw men) there is more real tyranny in socialist cesspools like Francis’ home of Argentina than in places where capitalism is predominant.

religion_and_faith,CBN,2,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/2017/trump-world-religion-tour,"A President, a Pope, and Peace: Steering World Religions to Common Ground?",2017-05-19,,"THE VATICAN — President Donald Trump 's first overseas foreign trip as president has finally brought him to the Vatican , where he came face-to-face with Pope Francis .
This world religion trip has had it all : kings in the Islamic world , a prime minister in Israel , and now the Pope in Rome .
Today , as Pope Francis greeted President Trump with a warm `` Welcome , '' Trump responded , `` Thank you very much . It 's a great honor . ''
It has been a religious whirlwind for a president whose goal is to root out terrorism by rallying the three major religions in a bid for peace . The Pope 's gift to President Trump was in that vein – a sculpted olive tree , symbolizing peace .
The Pope also gave the president a few books to read , including The Joy of the Gospel , which talks about having a personal relationship with Jesus , along with fighting for social justice around the world .
███ News has had an up-close view of the events unfolding on the president 's trip . We were part of a select group of press who came to the Vatican to witness a bit of history .
Senior administration officials tell ███ News the world religion tour intentionally included the Vatican , to help reset Trump 's relationship with the Pope . It got a bit testy during the presidential campaign .
The POTUS/Pope spat goes back to when the Pontiff took issue with candidate Trump 's insistence on building a `` big beautiful border wall . '' Pope Francis said someone who thinks about building walls and not bridges is not a Christian . And Trump fired back .
`` For a religious leader to question a person 's faith is disgraceful , '' Trump had charged . `` I am proud to be a Christian and as president I will not allow Christianity to be consistently attacked and weakened… [ The Mexican government is ] using the pope as a pawn and they should be ashamed of themselves for doing so , especially when so many lives are involved and when illegal immigration is so rampant . ''
`` A person who says 'no walls , but bridges , ' and the other who says 'walls , not bridges , ' is something which you can not reconcile , '' Italian newspaper columnist Massimo Franco said .
Nina Shea , with the Hudson Institute , tells ███ News the president 's visit to the Vatican is an opportunity to mend fences .
`` Certainly the Pope is leader of a church that has millions of followers , '' Shea said . `` It 's important that he make peace with Pope Francis and vice/versa . ''
There are stark contrasts between the two leaders . They do n't see eye-to-eye on immigration , climate change , or dealing with Syrian refugees . They do agree on stopping religious persecution and combating human trafficking .
There are plenty of important issues in a world that just gets darker by the day . The president believes the world 's three major religions can have a big say in the outcome .
Trump 's visit to Rome came right after he wrapped up a whirlwind tour of Israel , where he called for peace between the Jewish state and her Palestinian neighbors .
Speaking at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem , Trump sounded optimistic as he declared his belief that both sides were eager to move forward in the peace process .
`` We know that peace is possible if we put aside the pain and disagreements of the past , '' the president said .
`` As I have repeatedly said , I am personally committed to helping Israelis and Palestinians achieve a peace agreement , and I had a meeting this morning with President Mahmoud Abbas and I can tell you that the Palestinians are ready to reach for peace – and , from my meeting with my friend Benjamin Netanyahu , I can tell you Israelis are ready to reach for peace as well , '' he continued .
Watch ███ News Chief Political Correspondent David Brody 's analysis of Donald Trump 's speech below :
`` Making peace will not be easy , '' he acknowledged . `` We all know that . Both sides will face tough decisions . But with determination , compromise , and the belief that peace is possible , Israelis and Palestinians can make a deal . ''
Addressing his `` good friend '' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , the president reiterated his commitment to stand with the Jewish state .
`` I stand in awe of the accomplishments of the Jewish people , and I make this promise to you : My administration will always stand with Israel , '' he pledged . `` Through your hardships , you have created one of the most abundant lands in the world . A land that is rich not only in history , culture , and opportunity , but especially in spirit .
Netanyahu for his part thanked the U.S. president for a speech `` that in so few words said so much . ''
'Peace in the Middle East , ' how many times have we heard that before ? But will things be different now that President Trump is on the scene ? The peace process has never seen anything quite like him .
Before Trump was president , he was known as one of the best deal makers in the entire world . Well , now he 's come to Israel , hoping for what he calls `` the ultimate deal '' – peace between Israelis and the Palestinians .
In a speech Tuesday at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem , he assured the Jewish state that he is `` personally committed '' to making that a reality .
`` Palestinians are ready to reach for peace , '' Trump said . `` Benjamin Netanyahu wants peace . ''
Striking a Mideast peace deal , however , is not going to be an easy task . There are plenty of stumbling blocks ahead . But one thing is for sure : All roads lead to Jerusalem .
The ultimate stumbling block in any sort of two-state solution : The fact that both Palestinians and Israelis see Jerusalem as their capital . The official U.S. policy is that it 's disputed territory , but as a candidate , Trump told ███ News he was ready to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem .
`` Well I am for that 100 percent . We are for that 100 percent , '' candidate Trump told us in an interview on the campaign trail at Liberty University .
But things are different now that Trump is president . He 's dialing it back .
He told us in an interview after becoming president , `` Well , there is certainly a chance of it . Absolutely . But we are going to be — we are doing very detailed studies on that and it will come out very soon . I hate to do that because that is not usually me , studies , '' he said , adding , `` But this has two sides to it . It 's not easy . ''
That 's because a provocative step like moving the embassy to Jerusalem may disrupt the peace process before it gets going . So , Trump 's trip to the Mideast came without an embassy announcement . That has been disappointing to many Israelis .
Trump did make history , though . He became the first sitting U.S. president to come to Israel and visit the Western Wall in Jerusalem . Some see that as acceptance – as the United States ' acceptance – of Jerusalem . But some members of the Trump administration wo n't say the wall is part of Israel . It 's all part of a very sensitive process .
`` It 's not easy . I 've heard it 's one of the toughest deals of all . But I have a feeling that we 're going to get there eventually . I hope , '' President Trump said .
`` I do look forward our discussions , which I think are peppered with possibility , '' said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .
There is hope , and it comes from an unlikely customer : Iran .
The administration believes additional Arab nations , like Saudi Arabia , will be willing to work more closely with Israel and stand together against a common enemy , thus advancing the peace process .
███ News talked with Walid Phares , a former foreign policy advisor on the Trump presidential campaign .
`` Definitely President Trump has the intention , '' Phares said . `` He has the heart to it . He wants to achieve it as something big that no previous president has been able to solve , but realities are realities , not just in our politics here in the United States , but in the Middle East . ''
President Trump knows he will have his hands full getting the Palestinians to the table to negotiate . His meeting in Bethlehem with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas was an attempt to see what is possible .
`` We have no problem with Judaism . We have a problem with the occupation , '' Abbas said during a meeting with Trump in Bethlehem , Tuesday morning .
For his part , President Trump is keeping his cards close to the vest . He has n't signaled what a peace plan would look like or how to get there . That 's an intentional move . It 's part of his deal-making DNA . The question is – will that and his big personality be able to push this peace process over the finish line ?
Earlier Tuesday morning Trump met briefly with Abbas . While the U.S. president avoided using the term 'two-state solution , ' Abbas minced no words in presenting new ideas for the resumption of peace talks with Israel .
`` We are keen to open the door to dialogue with our Israeli neighbors in order to create a genuine peace , '' the P.A . leader said . `` Our problem is with the occupation and settlements and the failure of Israel to recognize the state of Palestine in the same way we recognize it . The problem is not between us and Judaism ; it is between us and occupation . ''
Following Monday 's visits to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and the Western Wall in Jerusalem 's Old City , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hosted President Trump for a visit that both leaders described as exceptionally warm .
After their private meeting , the men emerged and gave public comments .
`` We had a terrific discussion today and when I say terrific , it encompasses everything , '' said the prime minister .

Only on The Brody File : Franklin Graham 's Advice for President Trump : Do n't Kiss Up to Saudi Arabia","THE VATICAN — President Donald Trump's first overseas foreign trip as president has finally brought him to the Vatican, where he came face-to-face with Pope Francis.

This world religion trip has had it all: kings in the Islamic world, a prime minister in Israel, and now the Pope in Rome.

Today, as Pope Francis greeted President Trump with a warm ""Welcome,"" Trump responded, ""Thank you very much. It's a great honor.""

It has been a religious whirlwind for a president whose goal is to root out terrorism by rallying the three major religions in a bid for peace. The Pope's gift to President Trump was in that vein – a sculpted olive tree, symbolizing peace.

""We could use some peace,"" Trump said.



The Pope also gave the president a few books to read, including The Joy of the Gospel, which talks about having a personal relationship with Jesus, along with fighting for social justice around the world.



CBN News has had an up-close view of the events unfolding on the president's trip. We were part of a select group of press who came to the Vatican to witness a bit of history.



Senior administration officials tell CBN News the world religion tour intentionally included the Vatican, to help reset Trump's relationship with the Pope. It got a bit testy during the presidential campaign.

The POTUS/Pope spat goes back to when the Pontiff took issue with candidate Trump's insistence on building a ""big beautiful border wall."" Pope Francis said someone who thinks about building walls and not bridges is not a Christian. And Trump fired back.

""For a religious leader to question a person's faith is disgraceful,"" Trump had charged. ""I am proud to be a Christian and as president I will not allow Christianity to be consistently attacked and weakened… [The Mexican government is] using the pope as a pawn and they should be ashamed of themselves for doing so, especially when so many lives are involved and when illegal immigration is so rampant.""

""A person who says 'no walls, but bridges,' and the other who says 'walls, not bridges,' is something which you cannot reconcile,"" Italian newspaper columnist Massimo Franco said.



Nina Shea, with the Hudson Institute, tells CBN News the president's visit to the Vatican is an opportunity to mend fences.

""Certainly the Pope is leader of a church that has millions of followers,"" Shea said. ""It's important that he make peace with Pope Francis and vice/versa.""



There are stark contrasts between the two leaders. They don't see eye-to-eye on immigration, climate change, or dealing with Syrian refugees. They do agree on stopping religious persecution and combating human trafficking.

There are plenty of important issues in a world that just gets darker by the day. The president believes the world's three major religions can have a big say in the outcome.

Trump: 'Peace Is Possible'

Trump's visit to Rome came right after he wrapped up a whirlwind tour of Israel, where he called for peace between the Jewish state and her Palestinian neighbors.

Speaking at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, Trump sounded optimistic as he declared his belief that both sides were eager to move forward in the peace process.

""We know that peace is possible if we put aside the pain and disagreements of the past,"" the president said.

""As I have repeatedly said, I am personally committed to helping Israelis and Palestinians achieve a peace agreement, and I had a meeting this morning with President Mahmoud Abbas and I can tell you that the Palestinians are ready to reach for peace – and, from my meeting with my friend Benjamin Netanyahu, I can tell you Israelis are ready to reach for peace as well,"" he continued.

Watch CBN News Chief Political Correspondent David Brody's analysis of Donald Trump's speech below:

""Making peace will not be easy,"" he acknowledged. ""We all know that. Both sides will face tough decisions. But with determination, compromise, and the belief that peace is possible, Israelis and Palestinians can make a deal.""

Addressing his ""good friend"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the president reiterated his commitment to stand with the Jewish state.

""I stand in awe of the accomplishments of the Jewish people, and I make this promise to you: My administration will always stand with Israel,"" he pledged. ""Through your hardships, you have created one of the most abundant lands in the world. A land that is rich not only in history, culture, and opportunity, but especially in spirit.

Netanyahu for his part thanked the U.S. president for a speech ""that in so few words said so much.""

The Art of the Mideast Deal

'Peace in the Middle East,' how many times have we heard that before? But will things be different now that President Trump is on the scene? The peace process has never seen anything quite like him.

Before Trump was president, he was known as one of the best deal makers in the entire world. Well, now he's come to Israel, hoping for what he calls ""the ultimate deal"" – peace between Israelis and the Palestinians.

In a speech Tuesday at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, he assured the Jewish state that he is ""personally committed"" to making that a reality.

""Palestinians are ready to reach for peace,"" Trump said. ""Benjamin Netanyahu wants peace.""

Striking a Mideast peace deal, however, is not going to be an easy task. There are plenty of stumbling blocks ahead. But one thing is for sure: All roads lead to Jerusalem.

The ultimate stumbling block in any sort of two-state solution: The fact that both Palestinians and Israelis see Jerusalem as their capital. The official U.S. policy is that it's disputed territory, but as a candidate, Trump told CBN News he was ready to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

""Well I am for that 100 percent. We are for that 100 percent,"" candidate Trump told us in an interview on the campaign trail at Liberty University.



But things are different now that Trump is president. He's dialing it back.

He told us in an interview after becoming president, ""Well, there is certainly a chance of it. Absolutely. But we are going to be — we are doing very detailed studies on that and it will come out very soon. I hate to do that because that is not usually me, studies,"" he said, adding, ""But this has two sides to it. It's not easy.""

That's because a provocative step like moving the embassy to Jerusalem may disrupt the peace process before it gets going. So, Trump's trip to the Mideast came without an embassy announcement. That has been disappointing to many Israelis.

Trump did make history, though. He became the first sitting U.S. president to come to Israel and visit the Western Wall in Jerusalem. Some see that as acceptance – as the United States' acceptance – of Jerusalem. But some members of the Trump administration won't say the wall is part of Israel. It's all part of a very sensitive process.

""It's not easy. I've heard it's one of the toughest deals of all. But I have a feeling that we're going to get there eventually. I hope,"" President Trump said.



""I do look forward our discussions, which I think are peppered with possibility,"" said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.



There is hope, and it comes from an unlikely customer: Iran.

The administration believes additional Arab nations, like Saudi Arabia, will be willing to work more closely with Israel and stand together against a common enemy, thus advancing the peace process.

CBN News talked with Walid Phares, a former foreign policy advisor on the Trump presidential campaign.

""Definitely President Trump has the intention,"" Phares said. ""He has the heart to it. He wants to achieve it as something big that no previous president has been able to solve, but realities are realities, not just in our politics here in the United States, but in the Middle East.""



President Trump knows he will have his hands full getting the Palestinians to the table to negotiate. His meeting in Bethlehem with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas was an attempt to see what is possible.



""We have no problem with Judaism. We have a problem with the occupation,"" Abbas said during a meeting with Trump in Bethlehem, Tuesday morning.



For his part, President Trump is keeping his cards close to the vest. He hasn't signaled what a peace plan would look like or how to get there. That's an intentional move. It's part of his deal-making DNA. The question is – will that and his big personality be able to push this peace process over the finish line?

We'll see.

Meeting with Abbas

Earlier Tuesday morning Trump met briefly with Abbas. While the U.S. president avoided using the term 'two-state solution,' Abbas minced no words in presenting new ideas for the resumption of peace talks with Israel.

""We are keen to open the door to dialogue with our Israeli neighbors in order to create a genuine peace,"" the P.A. leader said. ""Our problem is with the occupation and settlements and the failure of Israel to recognize the state of Palestine in the same way we recognize it. The problem is not between us and Judaism; it is between us and occupation.""

Following Monday's visits to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and the Western Wall in Jerusalem's Old City, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hosted President Trump for a visit that both leaders described as exceptionally warm.

After their private meeting, the men emerged and gave public comments.

""We had a terrific discussion today and when I say terrific, it encompasses everything,"" said the prime minister.

He expressed his appreciation for Trump and his strong stance on issues like getting rid of the Iran nuclear deal and combating radical terrorism, noting a major difference between Trump and former President Barack Obama.

""For the first time in my lifetime, I see a real hope for change,"" Netanyahu remarked.

Watch the full press conference below.

Trump called Netanyahu a ""great friend"" and ally, though he stopped short of promising to rip up the Iran nuclear deal. He was also silent on the controversial two-state solution, which some tout as the way to bring lasting peace to the Middle East.

""I've heard it's one of the toughest deals of all, but I have a feeling we'll get there eventually -- I hope,"" Trump said on the complexities of the Israeli-Palestinian relationship.

Trump also spoke about his visit earlier in the day to one of the Jewish religion's most important sights.

""I was deeply moved by my visit today to the Western Wall,"" he said. ""It will leave an impression on me forever.""

Trump is first sitting U.S. president to visit the Western Wall. Donning a yarmulke, he prayed and placed a note in a crevice of the wall. Watch below.



After giving their comments, Trump and Netanyahu left for a private dinner with their wives at the prime minister's residence.



A Game Changer for Israel?

The president's trip marks a pivotal moment for the U.S. relationship with the Jewish state and the future of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.

""Your visit here, Mr. President, is truly historic,"" Netanyahu told Trump earlier after greeting the U.S. commander in chief at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion International Airport.. ""Never before has a first trip of a president of the United States included a trip to Israel. Thank you, Mr. President.""

Price,"Bill O ’ Reilly is a phenomenon . He is the host of the top-rated `` The O ’ Reilly Factor '' and the co-author of a number of bestselling historical books , notably `` Killing Lincoln '' and `` Killing Kennedy . '' To these he has recently added `` Killing Jesus : A History , '' written with Martin Dugard . I must confess to being a frequent viewer of `` The Factor . '' I enjoy Bill O ’ Reilly ’ s humor , and I usually agree with his social and political opinions ( though on some issues he is not quite conservative enough to suit me ) . I want you to be aware of this at the outset , because I want it to be clear I am not one of the man ’ s detractors who look for any opportunity to take him down . This book , a rejoinder to `` Killing Jesus , '' I felt compelled to write by my professional conscience as a New Testament scholar . It is evident to me that Bill O ’ Reilly and Martin Dugard are writing way , way out of their fields of expertise and that they simply do not understand either the principles of critical historiography or the difference between a historical and a religious treatment of a topic .
`` Killing Jesus '' attempts to apply the same principles of journalistic research that worked well enough in O ’ Reilly and Dugard ’ s books on the Lincoln and Kennedy assassinations . But it does not work . I hope to show ( as much as I regret having to ) that the task of reconstructing the events connected with a figure like Jesus Christ , the deity of the Christian faith , and that of writing about modern political figures , is as different as the heavens are from the earth .

From `` Killing History : Jesus in the No-Spin Zone '' ( Prometheus Books , 2014 ) . Reprinted by permission of the publisher .","Bill O’Reilly is a phenomenon. He is the host of the top-rated ""The O’Reilly Factor"" and the co-author of a number of bestselling historical books, notably ""Killing Lincoln"" and ""Killing Kennedy."" To these he has recently added ""Killing Jesus: A History,"" written with Martin Dugard. I must confess to being a frequent viewer of ""The Factor."" I enjoy Bill O’Reilly’s humor, and I usually agree with his social and political opinions (though on some issues he is not quite conservative enough to suit me). I want you to be aware of this at the outset, because I want it to be clear I am not one of the man’s detractors who look for any opportunity to take him down. This book, a rejoinder to ""Killing Jesus,"" I felt compelled to write by my professional conscience as a New Testament scholar. It is evident to me that Bill O’Reilly and Martin Dugard are writing way, way out of their fields of expertise and that they simply do not understand either the principles of critical historiography or the difference between a historical and a religious treatment of a topic.

""Killing Jesus"" attempts to apply the same principles of journalistic research that worked well enough in O’Reilly and Dugard’s books on the Lincoln and Kennedy assassinations. But it does not work. I hope to show (as much as I regret having to) that the task of reconstructing the events connected with a figure like Jesus Christ, the deity of the Christian faith, and that of writing about modern political figures, is as different as the heavens are from the earth. And ""Killing Jesus"" depends essentially upon ignoring that difference. I should estimate that reporting the historical truth about Jesus falls somewhere between documenting the facts about Robin Hood and Superman. It is just not the same thing at all. Another thing I aim to demonstrate is that to treat Jesus as one treats Abe Lincoln tends to make nonsense of the gospels, our main source concerning Jesus. If one loves the gospel accounts and wants to appreciate them by the standards by which they were written, one does not come out where O’Reilly and Dugard do. One does not even begin where they begin.

In both cases we are dealing with a genre very different from straight history.

We also support the Masterpiece Cakeshop baker.,2017-12-06,"Douglas Laycock, Thomas C. Berg, Alexia Fernández Campbell, Aaron Rupar, Marie Cascione, Hannah Brown, Ella Nilsen, Umair Irfan, German Lopez","The Supreme Court heard argument yesterday in Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission . The issue is whether a conservative Christian baker who believes that weddings are inherently religious and that same-sex marriages are religiously prohibited can be required to design and create a cake to celebrate the wedding of a same-sex couple .
The case tests the nation ’ s commitment to liberty and justice for all . And we aren ’ t doing well on the part about “ for all. ” Too many Americans , left and right , religious and secular , want liberty for their own side in the culture wars , but not for the other side .
The Supreme Court sometimes succumbs to these cultural divisions , but perhaps this time it will do better . In Obergefell v. Hodges , announcing the constitutional right to same-sex marriage , Justice Anthony Kennedy and the four liberals opened their opinion by declaring , “ The Constitution promises liberty to all within its reach , ” a liberty that allows persons “ to define and express their identity . ”
Masterpiece Cakeshop tests whether they meant it . Conservative believers are also within the Constitution ’ s reach . Does the Constitution protect their right to define and express their identity in religious terms equally with the right of same-sex couples to define and express their identity in sexual terms ? It should .
The two of us , in briefs and articles , have long urged judges , legislators , and our fellow citizens to protect the right of same-sex couples to marry and protect the right of religious dissenters not to assist with those marriages . That does not mean undercutting nondiscrimination laws in most cases of commercial goods and services . The Court can recognize a carefully defined right in the case of Jack Phillips , the owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop , and make room for both sides in the culture wars .
This is a unique event : a wedding . That makes a difference .
The wedding baker ’ s job , like that of the caterer , florist , photographer , and bridal shop , is to make his part of the wedding the best and most memorable it can be . He is promoting the wedding and the marriage it celebrates . Phillips , the owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop , says he can not do that . Many bakers may feel that their responsibility ends when they deliver the cake . But Phillips feels morally responsible for what he creates and helps to celebrate .
The result is that Phillips no longer makes wedding cakes for anybody . He has surrendered 40 percent of his business and laid off half his employees . Unless the Supreme Court intervenes , this is a permanent loss of occupation . His alternative was to permanently surrender his conscience .
And to what end ? To avoid the one-time offense to the same-sex couple of being turned away and being reminded of what they knew anyway : that some Americans still disapprove of their relationship . Their right to be married and to have a wedding cake were never at issue . Many bakers were eager for their business , and when the story broke , the couple promptly accepted an offer of a free wedding cake .
Same-sex couples and religious dissenters make parallel claims to liberty . They each argue that a core aspect of their identity is so fundamental that it should be left to each individual , free of all nonessential regulation . Their conduct can not be separated from their sexual orientation or their religious beliefs . Believers can no more fail to act on their understanding of God 's will than all gays and lesbians can remain celibate .
They each seek to live out their identities in public as well as in private . Same-sex couples are entitled to free access to the marketplace , but so are religious dissenters . The question is how to maximize access for both sides without requiring either to surrender core elements of their identity .
Finally , both religious dissenters and same-sex couples are condemned by many other Americans . One side sees bigotry ; the other side sees sin . Blue states refuse to protect religious liberty ; red states refuse to enact LGBTQ rights laws .
Most of the commentary on the case has focused on Phillips ’ s free speech claim . But the Court can decide the case on narrower grounds under the Free Exercise Clause , as we urged in a friend-of-the-court brief .
The free exercise claim is inherently limited to sincere religious objectors . And in this case , it is largely limited to weddings , a context that Phillips and many other believers understand as religious . Phillips claims no right to refuse service to gays and lesbians more generally . Any merchant who did so would have a losing case . For if merchants could discriminate anywhere and in any context , the obstacle to LGBTQ participation in the marketplace would be much greater , and the government ’ s interest in protecting them would be much greater . There may be religious conservatives who argue for that ; Phillips and his responsible supporters do not .
Of course Phillips ’ s opponents exaggerate his claim as much as possible . They strain to analogize his case to Jim Crow restaurants turning away black people , or a fundamentalist-owned bank refusing to handle women ’ s accounts . Courts would properly reject such ongoing denials of service — and they did in the Jim Crow era . This case involves a wedding , an event that we all hope to be the center of only once , and even if things go badly , no more than a very few times . This is not the same as visiting a restaurant or bank — it ’ s a rare occasion .
The free exercise claim has been neglected because too many people have read too much into the Supreme Court ’ s 1990 decision in Employment Division v. Smith . The Court said that the Free Exercise Clause does not apply to laws that are “ neutral and generally applicable. ” So Oregon could apply its “ across-the-board criminal prohibition ” to ban Native Americans from using peyote as their sacrament in worship services .
Too many observers have casually assumed that all but the most outrageous laws are neutral and generally applicable — that the Free Exercise Clause now bars only laws that single out religion for uniquely unfavorable regulation , or perhaps only laws that stem from government hostility to the regulated religion . But that is not what the Court said .
The Court did not explicitly define “ neutral and generally applicable law. ” But it gave examples , in Smith and in one later case , Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah , which involved animal sacrifice . Read carefully , those cases say this : If a law permits exceptions for some secular conduct that is analogous to the regulated religious conduct , then the state must also allow a religious exception , or show a compelling reason why not .
When the state exempts the secular conduct from regulation , but not the analogous religious conduct , it is unjustly discriminating against religion . And that is what the Free Exercise Clause forbids .
The secular exceptions need not be broad , or numerous , to require a religious exception . In Smith , the Court reaffirmed an earlier decision requiring South Carolina to pay unemployment compensation to a woman who lost her job for refusing work on her Sabbath . But South Carolina had a rule that allowed unemployment compensation to be paid to workers who refused work for “ good cause. ” There weren ’ t many “ good causes , ” but the Court said there were “ at least some. ” You can refuse work in a strip club even if there are openings , for example , and collect unemployment instead ; you can decline a job because of an unrealistically long commute . The state , the Court concluded , had to put religious reasons for refusing work in the very small set of “ good ” reasons , and not in the vastly larger set of “ bad ” reasons .
In Lukumi , the Court struck down the city of Hialeah ’ s ban on religious sacrifice of animals . In this case , there were many permitted secular reasons for killing animals ( food , hunting , euthanasia , etc . ) , and only a few forbidden reasons . But the Court again decided that such tallying was not required ; it said the Hialeah ordinances did not come close to constitutionality .
Florida law allowed the use of live rabbits to train racing greyhounds . Comparing that state law to the city ’ s ban on animal sacrifice , the Court said that the law “ devalues religious reasons for killing [ animals ] by judging them to be of lesser import than nonreligious reasons . ”
Four federal courts of appeals and several other state and federal courts have recognized that granting even one or a few secular exceptions makes a law less than generally applicable and requires a compelling justification for refusing religious exceptions .
The most prominent of these decisions , written by then-Judge Samuel Alito in 1999 , on the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit , held that a Muslim policeman who wore a beard as a religious duty could challenge the Newark Police Department ’ s ban on facial hair . The department had granted a medical exception for officers with a skin condition aggravated by shaving . That single exception , the court said , made the law non-generally applicable , triggering strict constitutional scrutiny ; granting the medical exception but denying the religious exception “ made a value judgment in favor of secular motivations , but not religious motivations . ”
What the courts said when bakers refused to write anti-gay messages on their cakes
How does all this apply to Masterpiece Cakeshop ? Colorado ’ s public accommodations law prohibits businesses from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation , religion , or other traditional civil rights categories . On its face it has no secular exceptions . But it has been unevenly enforced in practice .
The Colorado Court of Appeals ruled that Phillips discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation by refusing to create a cake celebrating a same-sex marriage — because that celebratory message is closely associated with gays and lesbians . But it explicitly approved three cases holding that other bakers did not discriminate on the basis of religion when they refused to create cakes with a quotation from Leviticus condemning homosexuality — a message obviously associated with a certain set of religious believers . The Colorado regulations are clear that religious discrimination includes not just discrimination based on affiliation , but discrimination based on a particular religious belief — exactly what the other bakers did .
The appeals court said many more inconsistent things about the two sets of cases . It let the protected bakers take responsibility for the message their cakes would send and refuse to send that message . By contrast , it denied that Phillips ’ s wedding cake would send any message , and then said that if his cake did send a message , it would be the customers ’ message , not the baker ’ s . It said that the protected baker ’ s willingness to make other cakes with “ Christian themes ” for other Christian customers was exonerating , but that Phillips ’ s willingness to make anything but a wedding cake for his gay and lesbian customers was irrelevant .
Refusing to create a cake with a message associated with a protected class of customers — whether same-sex couples or conservative Christians — either discriminates against that class or it does not . The message on a cake is either the baker ’ s message or the customer ’ s message , or perhaps the message of both . But the answers to these questions can not vary depending on whether the state agrees with the message , which is how it worked out in the Colorado courts .
Protecting the bakers who refused to make the Leviticus cakes undermines the state ’ s interest in eliminating religious discrimination at least as much as protecting Phillips would undermine the state ’ s interest in eliminating sexual-orientation discrimination .
The state has tried to distinguish the two sets of bakers by saying that the protected bakers would not make the Leviticus cake for anybody . The state court never made that argument . The protected bakers were in the business of making custom cakes with messages and designs requested by customers , and they refused the Leviticus cake because they disapproved a message strongly associated with a particular religious view . Phillips is in the same business , and refused for the same reason ( substituting sexual orientation for religion ) . And suppose Phillips says he wouldn ’ t make a cake with two grooms for anybody . The state ’ s answers at yesterday ’ s oral argument clearly implied that Colorado would say that ’ s sexual orientation discrimination .
We should not have to go through this detailed analysis to protect a simple act of conscience . Same-sex couples should be free to marry , with fancy weddings and wedding cakes , and conscientious objectors should not be required to assist . But under the Supreme Court ’ s interpretation , the Constitution protects religious conscience only against laws that fail its test of general applicability . Fortunately for Jack Phillips , the Colorado law as it was administered fails that test .
Douglas Laycock is a professor of constitutional law at the University of Virginia . Thomas C. Berg is a professor of constitutional law at University of St. Thomas ( Minnesota ) . They have long advocated for protecting same-sex marriage and for protecting religious dissenters .","The Supreme Court heard argument yesterday in Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission. The issue is whether a conservative Christian baker who believes that weddings are inherently religious and that same-sex marriages are religiously prohibited can be required to design and create a cake to celebrate the wedding of a same-sex couple.

The case tests the nation’s commitment to liberty and justice for all. And we aren’t doing well on the part about “for all.” Too many Americans, left and right, religious and secular, want liberty for their own side in the culture wars, but not for the other side.

Hodges, announcing the constitutional right to same-sex marriage, Justice Anthony Kennedy and the four liberals opened their opinion by declaring, “The Constitution promises liberty to all within its reach,” a liberty that allows persons “to define and express their identity.”

Masterpiece Cakeshop tests whether they meant it. Conservative believers are also within the Constitution’s reach. Does the Constitution protect their right to define and express their identity in religious terms equally with the right of same-sex couples to define and express their identity in sexual terms? It should.

The two of us, in briefs and articles, have long urged judges, legislators, and our fellow citizens to protect the right of same-sex couples to marry and protect the right of religious dissenters not to assist with those marriages.

The most prominent of these decisions, written by then-Judge Samuel Alito in 1999, on the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, held that a Muslim policeman who wore a beard as a religious duty could challenge the Newark Police Department’s ban on facial hair. The department had granted a medical exception for officers with a skin condition aggravated by shaving. That single exception, the court said, made the law non-generally applicable, triggering strict constitutional scrutiny; granting the medical exception but denying the religious exception “made a value judgment in favor of secular motivations, but not religious motivations.”

What the courts said when bakers refused to write anti-gay messages on their cakes

How does all this apply to Masterpiece Cakeshop? Colorado’s public accommodations law prohibits businesses from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation, religion, or other traditional civil rights categories. On its face it has no secular exceptions. But it has been unevenly enforced in practice.

The Colorado Court of Appeals ruled that Phillips discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation by refusing to create a cake celebrating a same-sex marriage — because that celebratory message is closely associated with gays and lesbians. But it explicitly approved three cases holding that other bakers did not discriminate on the basis of religion when they refused to create cakes with a quotation from Leviticus condemning homosexuality — a message obviously associated with a certain set of religious believers. The Colorado regulations are clear that religious discrimination includes not just discrimination based on affiliation, but discrimination based on a particular religious belief — exactly what the other bakers did.

The appeals court said many more inconsistent things about the two sets of cases. It let the protected bakers take responsibility for the message their cakes would send and refuse to send that message. By contrast, it denied that Phillips’s wedding cake would send any message, and then said that if his cake did send a message, it would be the customers’ message, not the baker’s. It said that the protected baker’s willingness to make other cakes with “Christian themes” for other Christian customers was exonerating, but that Phillips’s willingness to make anything but a wedding cake for his gay and lesbian customers was irrelevant.

Refusing to create a cake with a message associated with a protected class of customers — whether same-sex couples or conservative Christians — either discriminates against that class or it does not. The message on a cake is either the baker’s message or the customer’s message, or perhaps the message of both. But the answers to these questions cannot vary depending on whether the state agrees with the message, which is how it worked out in the Colorado courts.

Protecting the bakers who refused to make the Leviticus cakes undermines the state’s interest in eliminating religious discrimination at least as much as protecting Phillips would undermine the state’s interest in eliminating sexual-orientation discrimination.

The state has tried to distinguish the two sets of bakers by saying that the protected bakers would not make the Leviticus cake for anybody. The state court never made that argument. The protected bakers were in the business of making custom cakes with messages and designs requested by customers, and they refused the Leviticus cake because they disapproved a message strongly associated with a particular religious view. Phillips is in the same business, and refused for the same reason (substituting sexual orientation for religion). And suppose Phillips says he wouldn’t make a cake with two grooms for anybody. The state’s answers at yesterday’s oral argument clearly implied that Colorado would say that’s sexual orientation discrimination.

We should not have to go through this detailed analysis to protect a simple act of conscience. Same-sex couples should be free to marry, with fancy weddings and wedding cakes, and conscientious objectors should not be required to assist. But under the Supreme Court’s interpretation, the Constitution protects religious conscience only against laws that fail its test of general applicability. Fortunately for Jack Phillips, the Colorado law as it was administered fails that test.

Douglas Laycock is a professor of constitutional law at the University of Virginia. Thomas C. Berg is a professor of constitutional law at University of St. Thomas (Minnesota). They have long advocated for protecting same-sex marriage and for protecting religious dissenters.

Upon his arrival Tuesday, he was greeted by the first family and then taken to the Vatican embassy.

He is now the fourth head of the Catholic Church to visit the United States. While Pope Francis and the current administration have many areas of common ground, he could bring up some sensitive political topics, like the Iran nuclear agreement and the relationship between the United States and Cuba.

The pope's first full day in the United States includes a visit to the White House.

The Wall Street Journal reports the Vatican has objected to some of the guests the Obama administration has invited, including transgender activists, an openly gay Episcopal bishop, and a pro-abortion nun.

Francis Rooney, former ambassador to the Vatican in the George W. Bush administration, Francis Rooney, said the popes critical views on capitalism are shaped by his experience in Argentina and that he believes this trip to the U.S. can possibly changes those views. Click play to watch.

""It's something that we see he's trying to push his own political agenda and the Vatican of course found this offensive. And really the pope doesn't want to be used as a political tool for the Obama administration,"" Arina Grossu, director of the Center for Human Dignity at Family Research Council, said.

Franklin Graham also took exception to the president's actions.

""Is there no end to the lengths the president will go to in order to push his sinful agenda?"" he said in a Facebook post.

After his meetings at the White House, the pope will take part in a parade through the National Mall. Later in the day, he'll hold a canonization at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception.

Francis also called for a fairer world economy , the abolition of the death penalty , the protection of ethnic and religious minorities , the outlawing of the global `` blood '' trade in arms and the protection of the family in a speech sure to please liberals .
The speech underscored the emergence of Pope Francis as a global political leader -- rather than a moral or spiritual voice alone . His boldness in staking out positions on the nation 's most pressing issues could reverberate through Capitol Hill and the 2016 presidential race in the months to come .
Practicing what he preached , the wildly popular pontiff , who has drawn thousands onto the streets along with blanket media coverage during his U.S. visit , then headed to pray and eat with homeless people and to pose for selfies with his adoring flock .
The Pope , who was greeted by cheers as he stepped onto the floor of the House of Representatives and received several standing ovations and sustained applause during his address , did not scold lawmakers -- his tone was more akin to that of a sermon or a pep talk . But he did not shirk from delivering blunt political messages .
He laid out an implicit counter-argument to some conservatives , including 2016 Republican front-runner Donald Trump , who believes that the more than 10 million undocumented immigrants in the country should be deported . He implied that to do so would repudiate America 's founding purpose as a nation born of immigrants seeking a better life .
`` We , the people of this continent , are not fearful of foreigners , because most of us were once foreigners , '' he said , as Vice President Joe Biden and an often tearful Republican House Speaker John Boehner , both Catholics , watched from the dais .
`` I say this to you as the son of immigrants , knowing that so many of you are also descended from immigrants , '' Francis told the audience of lawmakers , top military brass , Supreme Court justices and Cabinet members on the floor of the House .
He made a clear connection between undocumented immigrants in the U.S. and the exodus of Syrians and others into Europe from wars raging in the Middle East .
`` On this continent , too , thousands of persons are led to travel north in search of a better life for themselves and for their loved ones , in search of greater opportunities , '' he said of migrants from Central and South America , indicating they needed to be treated as people seeking refuge rather than as exploiting the United States ' porous borders .
In an apparent rebuke to politicians who have criticized the tide of undocumented immigrants , he continued , `` We must not be taken aback by their numbers , but rather view them as persons , seeing their faces and listening to their stories , trying to respond as best we can to their situation . ''
Then , citing Scripture to drive home his argument , Francis said : `` Let us remember the Golden Rule : 'Do unto others as you would have them do to you . ' ''

He called on often warring lawmakers to honor the example of their greatest national heroes , like Martin Luther King , Jr. and Abraham Lincoln .
Francis appeared to reflect on news coverage of racial violence over the past year and a debate over the place of Muslims in U.S. society that arose in recent weeks .
Citing Martin Luther King 's `` dream of full rights for all their brothers and sisters , '' he urged Americans in the 50 minute speech to remember the civil rights icon 's legacy of `` liberty in plurality and non-exclusion . ''
Referring to turmoil tearing apart the Middle East , Francis warned the world was increasingly a place of fundamentalism and `` brutal atrocities '' sometimes committed in the name of religion , but he warned against a simplistic world view pitting good versus evil or `` the righteous and the sinners . ''
`` We know that in the attempt to be freed of the enemy without , we can be tempted to feed the enemy within , '' Francis warned .
Clearly conscious that many conservatives in Congress are skeptical that mankind is contributing to global warming , he called for a courageous and responsible effort to avert `` environmental deterioration caused by human activity '' and said Congress had an `` important role to play . ''
He also praised efforts in recent months to `` help overcome historic differences linked to painful episodes of the past , '' a passage that President Barack Obama 's supporters may take as approval of his controversial policies towards Cuba and Iran .
Amid criticism that he is overly critical of global capitalism and dismisses its place in lifting millions of people out of poverty , Francis acknowledged that `` business is a noble vocation , directed to producing wealth and improving the world . ''
But he cautioned that wealth should be shared and geared to `` the creation of jobs as an essential part of its service to the common good . ''
He did , however , cut one section of his prepared speech , in which he referred to the Declaration of Independence and said that politics should not be a `` slave to the economy and finance . ''
Vatican spokesman Father Lombardi later said the Pope made a `` little oversight '' and skipped those lines by mistake , with the prepared text of the speech to Congress remaining the official version .
The Pope also counseled members of the unpopular and divided Congress of the need to move forward together in a generous spirit of fraternity .
`` The challenges facing us today call for a renewal of that spirit of cooperation , which has accomplished so much good throughout the history of the United States , '' he said , and called on America to act on his appeals .
`` The complexity , the gravity and the urgency of these challenges demand that we pool our resources and talents and resolve to support one another , with respect for our differences and our convictions of conscience , '' he said .
Francis , who will take part Sunday in a World Meeting of Families in Philadelphia on the last stop of his trip to the United States , also made an oblique reference Thursday to the increasing prevalence of same-sex marriage , which the Supreme Court endorsed nationwide earlier this year .
`` I can not hide my concern for the family , which is threatened , perhaps as never before , from within and without , '' Francis said . `` Fundamental relationships are being called into question , as is the very basis of marriage and the family . ''
The Pope drew cheers , especially from the Republican side of the House , when he spoke of the need to `` protect and defend human life at every stage of its development , '' in a reference to abortion .
But he earned only a smattering of applause when he said that reverence for life also means supporting the global abolition of the death penalty . Francis threw his weight behind efforts to pass criminal justice reform , saying society `` can only benefit from the rehabilitation of those convicted of crimes . ''
There were also signs of a partisan split in the chamber when Francis mentioned global warming and immigration , which Democrats applauded while many Republicans did not .
But despite the progressive content of his speech , Francis appeared to avoid offending anyone .
`` We found ourselves standing up and sitting down more than what we anticipated , '' Republican Sen. Mike Rounds told CNN 's Dana Bash . Former GOP vice presidential nominee Rep. Paul Ryan told CNN that it would be wrong to treat the speech as `` a sort of laundry list of policies . ''

Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders , meanwhile , welcomed the liberal content of an address that he described as dignified and nonpartisan .
After his speech , Francis appeared on the Speaker 's balcony along with bipartisan leaders of Congress and smiled broadly at the thousands of people gathered below on the National Mall . He singled out children for special mention , and asked even those who had no faith and could not pray to send him good wishes .
After making brief remarks in Spanish on the balcony , Francis concluded by declaring in English , `` God bless America ! ''
He then went to St Matthew 's Cathedral to pray with homeless people . He was mobbed by admirers outside , smiling broadly at children and posing for pictures shot on mobile phones , as Secret Service agents and Vatican officials cleared his way through the crowd .
`` In prayer , there are no rich or poor people , '' the pontiff said in the church . `` There are sons and daughters . ''
`` Today I want to be one with you , '' he said . `` I need your support , your closeness . ''
Francis later flew out of Joint Base Andrews outside Washington and headed to New York , where he will ride his popemobile through Manhattan and lead evening prayers at St Patrick 's Cathedral before speaking at the United Nations on Friday . He will conclude his six-day visit to the United States in Philadelphia on Sunday .","Washington (CNN) Pope Francis challenged America Thursday to embrace millions of undocumented immigrants and join a global campaign against climate change and poverty, wading undaunted into the nation's volatile politics in a historic address to Congress.

""We know that in the attempt to be freed of the enemy without, we can be tempted to feed the enemy within,"" Francis warned.

Clearly conscious that many conservatives in Congress are skeptical that mankind is contributing to global warming, he called for a courageous and responsible effort to avert ""environmental deterioration caused by human activity"" and said Congress had an ""important role to play.""

He also praised efforts in recent months to ""help overcome historic differences linked to painful episodes of the past,"" a passage that President Barack Obama's supporters may take as approval of his controversial policies towards Cuba and Iran.

Amid criticism that he is overly critical of global capitalism and dismisses its place in lifting millions of people out of poverty, Francis acknowledged that ""business is a noble vocation, directed to producing wealth and improving the world.""

The pen was later used to sign the peace agreements between the parties earlier this year. Santos, who was awarded the 2016 Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to end the region's longest-running conflict, presented Pope Francis with the pen.

But he cautioned that wealth should be shared and geared to ""the creation of jobs as an essential part of its service to the common good.""

He did, however, cut one section of his prepared speech, in which he referred to the Declaration of Independence and said that politics should not be a ""slave to the economy and finance.""

Vatican spokesman Father Lombardi later said the Pope made a ""little oversight"" and skipped those lines by mistake, with the prepared text of the speech to Congress remaining the official version.

The Pope also counseled members of the unpopular and divided Congress of the need to move forward together in a generous spirit of fraternity.

""The challenges facing us today call for a renewal of that spirit of cooperation, which has accomplished so much good throughout the history of the United States,"" he said, and called on America to act on his appeals.

""The complexity, the gravity and the urgency of these challenges demand that we pool our resources and talents and resolve to support one another, with respect for our differences and our convictions of conscience,"" he said.

Francis, who will take part Sunday in a World Meeting of Families in Philadelphia on the last stop of his trip to the United States, also made an oblique reference Thursday to the increasing prevalence of same-sex marriage, which the Supreme Court endorsed nationwide earlier this year.

""I cannot hide my concern for the family, which is threatened, perhaps as never before, from within and without,"" Francis said. ""Fundamental relationships are being called into question, as is the very basis of marriage and the family.""

The Pope drew cheers, especially from the Republican side of the House, when he spoke of the need to ""protect and defend human life at every stage of its development,"" in a reference to abortion.

But he earned only a smattering of applause when he said that reverence for life also means supporting the global abolition of the death penalty. Francis threw his weight behind efforts to pass criminal justice reform, saying society ""can only benefit from the rehabilitation of those convicted of crimes.""

There were also signs of a partisan split in the chamber when Francis mentioned global warming and immigration, which Democrats applauded while many Republicans did not.

But despite the progressive content of his speech, Francis appeared to avoid offending anyone.

""We found ourselves standing up and sitting down more than what we anticipated,"" Republican Sen. Mike Rounds told CNN's Dana Bash. Former GOP vice presidential nominee Rep. Paul Ryan told CNN that it would be wrong to treat the speech as ""a sort of laundry list of policies.""

Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, meanwhile, welcomed the liberal content of an address that he described as dignified and nonpartisan.

After his speech, Francis appeared on the Speaker's balcony along with bipartisan leaders of Congress and smiled broadly at the thousands of people gathered below on the National Mall. He singled out children for special mention, and asked even those who had no faith and could not pray to send him good wishes.

After making brief remarks in Spanish on the balcony, Francis concluded by declaring in English, ""God bless America!""

He then went to St Matthew's Cathedral to pray with homeless people. He was mobbed by admirers outside, smiling broadly at children and posing for pictures shot on mobile phones, as Secret Service agents and Vatican officials cleared his way through the crowd.

""In prayer, there are no rich or poor people,"" the pontiff said in the church. ""There are sons and daughters.""

""Today I want to be one with you,"" he said. ""I need your support, your closeness.""

Francis later flew out of Joint Base Andrews outside Washington and headed to New York, where he will ride his popemobile through Manhattan and lead evening prayers at St Patrick's Cathedral before speaking at the United Nations on Friday. He will conclude his six-day visit to the United States in Philadelphia on Sunday.",www.cnn.com,left,iuk0Jf6Dorc1zxcm

They still do , and Pope Francis has encouraged them to undercut Trump ’ s agenda .

After Trump and Pence entered office , Tobin , with Pope Francis ’ s blessing , instructed his fellow bishops to ramp up their resistance , “ given the possibility that the administration isn ’ t going to be very interested in the questions that Pope Francis is interested in . ”

Earlier in the week , the Department of Justice sent a letter to California Gov . Gavin Newsom to raise “ several civil rights concerns with the treatment of places of worship ” in his executive orders and “ California Reopening Plan ” documents .
The letter was cosigned by the head of the civil rights division of the DOJ and all of the California office district heads . It reminded the state ’ s executive that “ Laws that do not treat religious activities equally with comparable nonreligious activities are subject to heightened scrutiny under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. ” That scrutiny would come in the form of them watching closely and litigating if necessary .

Mike Pence was savagely attacked by Democrats for backing “anti-gay” legislation, because someone somewhere in the state might use that law to defend against charges of discrimination. Pence looked like a deer in the headlights when confronted about this in national media. That he quickly backed and signed “clarifying” legislation has largely been ignored by his critics.

Increasingly, you’ve had one party that is broadly for the religious freedom of all Americans facing off against another party that thinks the first freedom recognized in the Bill of Rights should take a back seat to other concerns. The latest quarrels over quarantines are only throwing that disagreement into sharper relief.

`` As president , I will always protect religious liberty , '' Trump told faith leaders gathered in the White House Rose Garden . `` Prayer has always been the center of American life . It 's forged the identity and destiny of this great nation that we all love . ''

Trump 's faith initiate aims to allow people to exercise their beliefs freely and give faith-based organizations equal access to government funding .
The order calls for the executive branch to ensure `` conscience protections '' that grants people and institutions free reign `` to practice their faith without fear of discrimination or retaliation by the federal government . '' Here 's what it says :
`` It shall be the policy of the executive branch to vigorously enforce Federal law 's robust protections for religious freedom . The Founders envisioned a Nation in which religious voices and views were integral to a vibrant public square , and in which religious people and institutions were free to practice their faith without fear of discrimination or retaliation by the Federal Government . ''
It also directs the Treasury Department not to target churches or religious groups for speaking about political issues :
`` In particular , the Secretary of the Treasury shall ensure , to the extent permitted by law , that the Department of the Treasury does not take any adverse action against any individual , house of worship , or other religious organization on the basis that such individual or organization speaks or has spoken about moral or political issues from a religious perspective , where speech of similar character has , consistent with law , not ordinarily been treated as participation or intervention in a political campaign on behalf of ( or in opposition to ) a candidate for public office by the Department of the Treasury .

Christian leaders are reacting positively to Trump 's new White House plan to protect religious freedom and to work more closely with the faith community .
Evangelist Franklin Graham praised the move saying , `` I 'm extremely grateful that we have a president who realizes the importance of prayer , faith , and religious freedoms to our nation . ''
Johnnie Moore , an unofficial spokesman for the president 's group of faith advisors , said it 's `` good for America '' that President Trump has welcomed the faith community with open arms .
`` This executive order is the product of the President 's unwavering prioritization of faith and religious liberty and reflects the smart work of people like Jared Kushner and advisors in the policy and public liaison divisions who met with hundreds and hundreds of leaders and government officials to assess ways in which the government can partner more effectively with communities of faith , '' Moore said .
He also points out how important it is for there to be a faith-based liaison associated directly with the White House .
`` Ordering every department of the federal government to work on faith-based partnerships - not just those with faith offices - represents a widespread expansion of a program that has historically done very effective work and now can do even greater work , '' Moore continued .
He says he 'd like to see the White House faith-based effort focus on issues like prison reform , mental health issues , strengthening families , promoting education and meeting humanitarian needs .

California pastor and evangelist Greg Laurie also weighed in with praise for Trump 's latest pro-faith move .
`` I 've always believed that America is better when it 's faithful , together . Anything any administration can do to demonstrate a positive partnership between our faith communities and government , the better off our country will be and so I herald this important initiative that empowers people of faith in America , '' Laurie said .
Author and former Obama White House staffer Michael Wear believes the faith initiative is important work , but remains cautious .
`` It remains to be seen whether this Administration is truly interested in building an initiative that is focused on helping diverse faith communities serve those in need , or if the real value they see is in using the office as a platform where elite political supporters can pose as statesmen , '' Wear said .
“ I hope this Administration will keep the long-view in mind . I hope they will understand the decisions they make now , the focus of the faith-based initiative today , will greatly influence how future administrations consider the role of faith communities in this country , '' he added .

Friday’s news conference could put a strain on pastors because parishioners might pressure them into making hasty decisions. And it threatens to divide congregations who have different opinions about when and how to reopen.

AD

Earlier this year, many pastors received inadequate information on when to close their doors, and some faced deadly consequences. Your announcement makes decisions harder for church leaders by complicating clear public health messaging that caution during reopening is key.

Of course we want to go back to church. Some pastors who began opening in certain states have been preparing for several weeks for how to open safely and in consultation with their local public health officials. But an announcement on Friday does not give pastors adequate time to take the necessary preemptive steps to open by Sunday.

AD

And pastors, just because the president said on Friday churches are “essential” and should reopen does not mean that you should switch the lights back on this Sunday.

Public health experts have urged caution in resuming in-person mass gatherings. Earlier this week, National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins publicly said , “I think as Christians we have to have as our number one priority that we are going to care for the sick and the vulnerable. I cannot see, therefore, that it’s justifiable to bring large numbers of people together even in the name of worship, because of the risk it carries.”

AD

Before any church opens its doors, leaders must spend time setting up policies and guidelines that protect those who will be in attendance using the best science and guidance available.

AD

As leaders who have navigated pastors through natural disasters in the past, we provided a checklist for reopening churches . For instance, we recommend churches reach out to their insurance company to make sure they aren’t putting their congregation financially at risk. Churches also need to be able to secure proper sanitation supplies that would help prevent the possible spread of the coronavirus. Leaders need to recruit and train volunteers to guide the reopening process, such as helping with social distance measures. Leaders especially need to communicate to attendees about possible policy or procedural changes, such as how Communion might look different.

We encourage faith leaders to look to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , which has new guidance, for how best to respond. We have also regularly encouraged church leaders to look to local officials and authorities, including public health agencies, for direction.

Trump’s pronouncement corrupts our country’s ability to respond justly to this pandemic by putting politics over public health. The purpose appeared to be aimed at reaching evangelicals and Catholics, who will be valuable voters in the coming election.

Several faith leaders we have spoken with say people in their congregations, who already are under emotional strain, express a range of opinions about wanting to come back to church buildings. Some will stay away until there is a vaccine, and some want to be (or have been) back the minute it’s possible.

If we gather and cause community outbreaks, as happened in a large church in South Korea , and this week here in the United States in Georgia, Texas and Arkansas, it risks people’s lives. We must care for others in how we reopen.

AD

In some places in the country, starting to gather in person can be done cautiously, wisely and with joy. Those of us who live in areas where caution remains high can continue to be creative in worship, in supporting each other, and in serving our community. If we choose to emphasize the impact on our rights over the public health impact of our gathering, we diminish our love for our neighbor.

As the Apostle Paul once wrote, “ ‘I have the right to do anything,’ you say — but not everything is beneficial. ‘I have the right to do anything’ — but not everything is constructive.”

During the states’ lockdowns, many Christians expressed frustration at seeing liquor stores remain open and categorized as “essential” while houses of worship had to close their doors. Of course houses of worship remain crucial to the lives of many people and provide key resources to their communities. Churches are absolutely essential, but gathering in person is not yet.

He arouses the ire of conservatives and traditionalists , while his more liberal constituency wishes he 'd do more . Maybe that 's why I have so much sympathy for the guy — because when it comes to his relationships , it 's complicated .
The pope just released his first major statement on family of his three-year tenure as leader of the Catholic Church . The paper , released on Friday , is a 263-page call for greater inclusion and tolerance called `` Amoris Laetitia '' — `` The Joy of Love . '' To some , it reads as a groundbreaking step forward from the Vatican for previously shunned individuals like single parents , couples living together outside of marriage and divorced people . To critics , though , it does n't go far enough , still focusing , as a USA Today headline put it , on `` good news for divorced , but not for gays . ''
The document , two years in the making , offers no groundbreaking new proclamations , no official changes in Church policy . It affirms that `` every person regardless of sexual orientation… be respected in his or her dignity and treated with consideration '' while it also insists that `` There are absolutely no grounds for considering homosexual unions to be in any way similar or even remotely analogous to God ’ s plan for marriage and family . '' It lightly acknowledges that `` the upright consciences of spouses who have been generous in transmitting life may lead them , for sufficiently serious reasons , to limit the number of their children '' but does n't come out with any new directives for reproductive rights .
It is not an earth-shattering message . It is not a call for sweeping reform . And to the many whose own lives are not affected by what a bunch of men working in an incredibly old and flawed institution say , it 's not a big deal . But it is nevertheless , to those invested in the Catholic Church and the way it conducts itself in the world , a progressive statement . The letter urges that `` Seeing things with the eyes of Christ inspires the Church ’ s pastoral care for the faithful who are living together , or are only married civilly , or are divorced and remarried… . The Church turns with love to those who participate in her life in an imperfect manner… . The Christian community ’ s care of such persons is not to be considered a weakening of its faith and testimony to the indissolubility of marriage . ''
And maybe this does n't have the tone of a Hillary rally , but as an eternally conflicted feminist Catholic woman , I found this a real mic drop : `` I think particularly of the shameful ill-treatment to which women are sometimes subjected , domestic violence and various forms of enslavement which , rather than a show of masculine power , are craven acts of cowardice . The verbal , physical , and sexual violence that women endure in some marriages contradicts the very nature of the conjugal union . I think of the reprehensible genital mutilation of women practiced in some cultures , but also of their lack of equal access to dignified work and roles of decision-making . ''
And this , in its own way , is also pretty rad : `` Young married couples should be encouraged to develop a routine that gives a healthy sense of closeness and stability through shared daily rituals . These could include a morning kiss , an evening blessing , waiting at the door to welcome each other home , taking trips together and sharing household chores… . As long as we can celebrate , we are able to rekindle our love , to free it from monotony and to color our daily routine with hope . '' Run and tell that , pontiff .
Naturally , Chill Pope 's crazy notions that `` A pastor can not feel that it is enough to simply apply moral laws to those living in '' and advice that `` Each country or region can seek solutions better suited to its culture and sensitive to its traditions and local needs '' has critics fuming . Catholic marriage counselor and writer Rose Sweet told the Washington Post Friday that `` We ’ re dealing with very immature , uninformed people who want Papa Francisco to give them what they want . '' And it 's not hard to find FOX News comments fretting that `` He 's taking the foundation of stone that Christianity is built upon and replacing it with sand because he thinks it 's the thing of the day . ''
Meanwhile , the sentiments of more liberal Catholics can be summed up with the observation of Catholicism scholar Lucetta Scaraffia , who told the New York Times , `` It wasn ’ t as innovative as many had hoped . The result is quite modest with respect to the investment and expectations that the world had . '' Ca n't please everybody . Possibly ca n't please anybody . Well , if that does n't does like every Democratic president , governor , or mayor I 've ever lived under , I do n't know what does .
Running a large institution — a country , a city , a church — is always mired in the politics of compromise . It 's always going to be a game of appeasement . Do I want so much more for women and LGBT persons ? Do I want their rights to live and love in safety and dignity recognized ? Oh , you bet . And I 'm going to keep pushing for that . But I 'm also psyched to have someone in a position of leadership who is n't actively scary , who is n't trying to undo the gains made and turn back the clock . And like Francis , I 'm trying to have hope , even in something that continues to chug along , as he 'd say , in an imperfect manner .","Pope Francis is the most Democratic president the papacy has ever seen.

I think of the reprehensible genital mutilation of women practiced in some cultures, but also of their lack of equal access to dignified work and roles of decision-making.""

And this, in its own way, is also pretty rad: ""Young married couples should be encouraged to develop a routine that gives a healthy sense of closeness and stability through shared daily rituals. These could include a morning kiss, an evening blessing, waiting at the door to welcome each other home, taking trips together and sharing household chores…. As long as we can celebrate, we are able to rekindle our love, to free it from monotony and to color our daily routine with hope."" Run and tell that, pontiff.

Naturally, Chill Pope's crazy notions that ""A pastor cannot feel that it is enough to simply apply moral laws to those living in"" and advice that ""Each country or region can seek solutions better suited to its culture and sensitive to its traditions and local needs"" has critics fuming. Catholic marriage counselor and writer Rose Sweet told the Washington Post Friday that ""We’re dealing with very immature, uninformed people who want Papa Francisco to give them what they want."" And it's not hard to find FOX News comments fretting that ""He's taking the foundation of stone that Christianity is built upon and replacing it with sand because he thinks it's the thing of the day.""

Meanwhile, the sentiments of more liberal Catholics can be summed up with the observation of Catholicism scholar Lucetta Scaraffia, who told the New York Times, ""It wasn’t as innovative as many had hoped. The result is quite modest with respect to the investment and expectations that the world had."" Can't please everybody. Possibly can't please anybody. Well, if that doesn't does like every Democratic president, governor, or mayor I've ever lived under, I don't know what does.

Running a large institution — a country, a city, a church — is always mired in the politics of compromise. It's always going to be a game of appeasement. Do I want so much more for women and LGBT persons? Do I want their rights to live and love in safety and dignity recognized? Oh, you bet. And I'm going to keep pushing for that. But I'm also psyched to have someone in a position of leadership who isn't actively scary, who isn't trying to undo the gains made and turn back the clock. And like Francis, I'm trying to have hope, even in something that continues to chug along, as he'd say, in an imperfect manner.",www.salon.com,left,kxOWjrMsNAecqnlt

religion_and_faith,Daily Beast,0,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-masterpiece-baker-is-back-now-he-wont-make-a-trans-themed-cake,The Masterpiece Baker Is Back. Now He Won’t Make a Trans-Themed Cake.,2018-08-16,Samantha Allen,"All along , Jack Phillips , the Christian baker at the heart of the Masterpiece Cakeshop Supreme Court case has claimed that he doesn ’ t deny service to specific people—just to individuals looking for cakes for specific events , like same-sex weddings .
“ I don ’ t discriminate against anybody—I serve everybody that comes in my shop , ” he told NBC in June , after the Supreme Court ruled that the state of Colorado had been hostile toward his religious beliefs . “ I don ’ t create cakes for every message that people ask me to create . ”
But in the latest legal drama involving Phillips and the anti-LGBT legal group Alliance Defending Freedom , that distinction between person and event is getting harder to maintain . It ’ s almost as if it was a spurious one to begin with .
As the Denver Post reported , the ADF filed a lawsuit Tuesday night on Phillips ’ behalf against Colorado Gov . John Hickenlooper and the Colorado Civil Rights Commission over the fact that the baker ’ s business was found to have violated non-discrimination law by refusing to make a birthday cake for a transgender lawyer named Autumn Scardina who also wanted the dessert to mark the anniversary of her gender transition .
According to the lawsuit , the cake—which Scardina specified in a phone call last June should have “ a blue exterior and pink interior ” —would have “ celebrated messages contrary to [ Phillips ’ ] religious belief that sex—the status of being male or female—is given by God , is biologically determined , is not determined by perceptions or feelings , and can not be chosen or changed . ”
The lawsuit maintains—as Phillips always has—that “ [ his ] decisions on whether to create a custom cake do not focus on who the customer is , but instead depend on what the custom cake will express or celebrate . ”
It also insists that he “ will create countless other custom cakes for people who identify as transgender , ” so long , presumably , as they are not tied to that person ’ s gender transition .
But that ’ s precisely where the distinction between the person and the event begins to break down .
What if a mother of a transgender girl ordered a cake that said “ Happy Birthday , My Beautiful Daughter ” or the wife of a transgender man requested a cake bearing the message “ Happy Anniversary to My Husband ” ?
Would that not violate the baker ’ s religious belief that one ’ s birth-assigned sex can never be changed—even though the cakes themselves are not directly celebrating a transition ?
And given the fact that not every parent , spouse , or friend of a transgender person goes around disclosing that relationship to cake makers , how can Phillips be sure that he is not unwittingly violating his religious beliefs about LGBT people all the time ?
As Zack Ford at ThinkProgress observed , “ If a customer can buy a product , but only if they hide their identity , then the business is clearly discriminating on the basis of that identity . ”
Phillips ’ lawsuit alleges that a woman whom he believes to be Scardina has been repeatedly testing the limits of his willingness to make cakes with requests for Satanic designs , or for cakes bearing symbols that are “ commonly linked to witchcraft ” —and that this cake was part of a pattern of harassment . ( Scardina in her complaint makes no mention of these other alleged incidents , saying that she was denied service after revealing that “ I am a transsexual and that I wanted my birthday cake to celebrate my transition by having a blue exterior and a pink interior . ” )
Whatever other requests Scardina may have made , the birthday cake case requires Phillips to tread especially in order to prove that his business does not discriminate on the basis of gender identity , as prohibited by Colorado state law .
The event is a birthday and the person is a transgender woman but the birthday also carries the added significance of coinciding with another past event : a transition .
That means Phillips has to argue that his issue is not the fact that Scardina is transgender , but the fact that she once transitioned—and if that seems like an arbitrary distinction , that ’ s because it probably is . When a person ’ s identity is the product of an event , it becomes harder to meaningfully separate the two .
Of course , this arbitrariness doesn ’ t necessarily reveal anything new about the greater intentions of the Alliance Defending Freedom , the legal group behind this and several other recent challenges to LGBT rights . Securing a broad right to discriminate against LGBT people on the basis of religious belief has long been the group ’ s apparent goal .
The ADF ’ s blog post about the new Masterpiece case not only misgenders Scardina—referring to her with a male pronoun—it insists that Phillips primarily takes issue with being asked to “ express a message that conflicts with his religious beliefs . ”
The lawsuit itself , too , trots out the same arguments about religious freedom , free speech , and the First Amendment that the ADF used in the Supreme Court to argue that Phillips shouldn ’ t be required to bake a cake for a same-sex wedding . We ’ ve heard this before .
But we can discern from other cases ADF has taken on that the distinction between “ person ” and “ event ” —between individual and “ message ” — is more strategic than anything else .
The ADF , after all , recently represented a Hawaii bed and breakfast owner who argued that she should be able to turn away a same-sex couple because of her religion .
That incident didn ’ t have to do with a specific “ event ” or “ message , ” it was just straight-up discrimination on the basis of religion—and the ADF still represented her , even after losing at the Hawaii Supreme Court level .
By taking on a new Masterpiece case involving a transgender customer , the ADF is coming close to overplaying its hand .
Plenty of Americans bought the argument that wedding service providers like bakers should be able to deny business to same-sex couples , but arguing that a baker should be able to turn away a transgender customer for wanting a birthday cake with transition-related theme could be a harder sell .","All along, Jack Phillips, the Christian baker at the heart of the Masterpiece Cakeshop Supreme Court case has claimed that he doesn’t deny service to specific people—just to individuals looking for cakes for specific events, like same-sex weddings.

After thanking his family , his law clerks , and his mentors , he grew emotional talking about his late Uncle Jack , an Episcopal priest , and his childhood in Colorado .
“ In my childhood it was God and Byron White , ” he said , referencing the former Supreme Court justice whom he clerked for . “ A product of the West , [ Justice White ] modeled for me judicial courage . ”
Indeed , “ God and Byron White ” could be a succinct description for the lines of inquiry Republicans and Democrats can be expected to take when the Senate Judiciary Committee begins questioning Judge Gorsuch Tuesday . As the minority , Democrats ca n't boycott him the way Senate Republicans did with Judge Merrick Garland , nominated by former President Obama . Instead they have tasked themselves with probing for weak spots in a nominee who for many legal observers has a close-to-spotless paper trail .
One line of inquiry that Democrats seem intent on pursuing concerns Gorsuch ’ s reputation as a staunch defender of religious liberty .
His broad interpretations of the rights and protections of religious believers – sometimes at the expense of large numbers of other citizens – have been a cornerstone of his jurisprudence during a decade serving on the US Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit .
“ That he comes down on side of religious liberty , even when it significantly infringes on the autonomy and liberty interests of large numbers of people , I think that ’ s an interesting area worthy of further explanation , ” says Sen. Chris Coons ( D ) of Delaware , a member of the Judiciary Committee , in an exclusive interview with the Monitor .
For a country founded as a sanctuary for people fleeing religious persecution and marginalization around the world , “ I think [ those questions ] should be subject to special consideration , ” he adds . “ The balance of faith and freedom , the balance of free exercise rights and autonomy or self-determination rights , are pretty fundamental questions that go back to the foundation of our country . ”
Gorsuch has pushed the envelope on this question , not least in perhaps his most noteworthy case from the 10th Circuit : “ Hobby Lobby Stores , Inc. v. Sebelius . ”
The case involved a family-owned company based in Oklahoma City that claimed that a mandate in the Affordable Care Act to provide contraception to its 28,000 employees made it complicit in an act that violated its religious beliefs . The 10th Circuit , with Gorsuch in the majority , sided with the company , and the Supreme Court narrowly upheld the decision 5 to 4 .
Along two other judges in the majority , Gorsuch said that he would have gone even further , and that individual business owners under the mandate should be able to make similar claims .
“ All of us face the problem of complicity . All of us must answer for ourselves whether and to what degree we are willing to be involved in the wrongdoing of others , ” he wrote in his opening . “ Whether an act of complicity is or isn ’ t ‘ too attenuated ’ from the underlying wrong is sometimes itself a matter of faith we must respect . ”
Conservatives who oppose such ideas as abortion rights , transgender bathroom access , and same-sex marriage often base their objections on religious grounds . And what concerns people like Senator Coons – who is a devout Presbyterian with both law and divinity degrees from Yale – is the interpretation that religious freedom rights outweigh the rights and protections of others .
“ One of the things I ’ m interested in is essentially allowing the complicity concerns of a small family to trump the liberty concerns of thousands and thousands of people , ” says Coons .
His judicial privileging of religious freedom has seen Gorsuch produce opinions that would likely appeal to liberals – including a majority opinion he wrote ruling that a Wyoming prison must allow a Native American inmate access to the prison ’ s sweat lodge . But his jurisprudence on religious freedom has endeared Gorsuch to conservatives .
Many conservatives also share Gorsuch ’ s view on public displays of religion , with the judge dissenting from majorities in the 10th Circuit on cases that struck down an Oklahoma county ’ s Ten Commandments display ( Gorsuch said the Commandments are not “ just religious ” and thus don ’ t violate the Constitution ) , and that ruled the Utah Highway Patrol couldn ’ t erect 12-foot crosses to memorialize fallen officers . ( Gorsuch believed that a “ reasonable observer ” would not think the crosses promoted Christianity . )
In his opening statement at Monday ’ s hearing , Sen. Jeff Flake ( R ) of Arizona said Gorsuch has “ demonstrated support for religious freedom , ” and then quoted the judge ’ s concurrence in the Hobby Lobby case that religious freedom law “ doesn ’ t just apply to protect popular religious beliefs : it does perhaps its most important work in protecting unpopular religious beliefs , vindicating this nation ’ s long-held aspiration to serve as a refuge of religious tolerance . ”
Besides the observation that he is clearly a man of faith , Gorsuch ’ s own religious leanings aren ’ t that clear . He was raised Catholic and attended Catholic schools , but now attends a progressive Episcopal church in Boulder , Colo . Comments from family members and friends give the impression of a man who is quietly , but deeply , spiritual .
Coons acknowledges that , and adds that “ it ’ s my responsibility to keep an open mind . ”
“ We ’ re both people for whom faith has played a big part in our lives , ” he says . But “ we may reach very different conclusions about what that means for the judicial role in privileging religious freedom over individual autonomy . ”
“ I genuinely enjoyed my [ earlier ] meetings with Judge Gorsuch , ” he adds . “ He ’ s a very engaging person , but I haven ’ t reached any conclusions yet . ”
In his statement on Monday , Coons pointed to “ disturbing trends in affronts to religious liberty , ” including President Trump ’ s campaign promise of a “ Muslim ban ” and the Justice Department ’ s withdrawal of guidance allowing transgender students to use the bathroom that matches their gender identity .
“ I am considering your nomination with an open mind , and I would ask that you would be forthcoming in your responses , ” he said .
“ I believe we must balance our respect for the significance of faith and free exercise with concerns about impacts on other 's liberty , ” he added . “ America needs a Supreme Court justice who will protect the Constitution , not one who will countenance faith or fear of some , as a justification for infringing the liberty of many . ”","Of all the people to speak on the first day of what promises to be a grueling week of hearings, Judge Neil Gorsuch – the man whose confirmation to the US Supreme Court is being deliberated – was notably concise.

“That he comes down on side of religious liberty, even when it significantly infringes on the autonomy and liberty interests of large numbers of people, I think that’s an interesting area worthy of further explanation,” says Sen. Chris Coons (D) of Delaware, a member of the Judiciary Committee, in an exclusive interview with the Monitor.

For a country founded as a sanctuary for people fleeing religious persecution and marginalization around the world, “I think [those questions] should be subject to special consideration,” he adds. “The balance of faith and freedom, the balance of free exercise rights and autonomy or self-determination rights, are pretty fundamental questions that go back to the foundation of our country.”

'The problem of complicity'

Gorsuch has pushed the envelope on this question, not least in perhaps his most noteworthy case from the 10th Circuit: “Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. v. Sebelius.”

The case involved a family-owned company based in Oklahoma City that claimed that a mandate in the Affordable Care Act to provide contraception to its 28,000 employees made it complicit in an act that violated its religious beliefs. The 10th Circuit, with Gorsuch in the majority, sided with the company, and the Supreme Court narrowly upheld the decision 5 to 4.

Along two other judges in the majority, Gorsuch said that he would have gone even further, and that individual business owners under the mandate should be able to make similar claims.

“All of us face the problem of complicity. All of us must answer for ourselves whether and to what degree we are willing to be involved in the wrongdoing of others,” he wrote in his opening. “Whether an act of complicity is or isn’t ‘too attenuated’ from the underlying wrong is sometimes itself a matter of faith we must respect.”

Conservatives who oppose such ideas as abortion rights, transgender bathroom access, and same-sex marriage often base their objections on religious grounds. And what concerns people like Senator Coons – who is a devout Presbyterian with both law and divinity degrees from Yale – is the interpretation that religious freedom rights outweigh the rights and protections of others.

“One of the things I’m interested in is essentially allowing the complicity concerns of a small family to trump the liberty concerns of thousands and thousands of people,” says Coons.

His judicial privileging of religious freedom has seen Gorsuch produce opinions that would likely appeal to liberals – including a majority opinion he wrote ruling that a Wyoming prison must allow a Native American inmate access to the prison’s sweat lodge. But his jurisprudence on religious freedom has endeared Gorsuch to conservatives.

Many conservatives also share Gorsuch’s view on public displays of religion, with the judge dissenting from majorities in the 10th Circuit on cases that struck down an Oklahoma county’s Ten Commandments display (Gorsuch said the Commandments are not “just religious” and thus don’t violate the Constitution), and that ruled the Utah Highway Patrol couldn’t erect 12-foot crosses to memorialize fallen officers. (Gorsuch believed that a “reasonable observer” would not think the crosses promoted Christianity.)

In his opening statement at Monday’s hearing, Sen. Jeff Flake (R) of Arizona said Gorsuch has “demonstrated support for religious freedom,” and then quoted the judge’s concurrence in the Hobby Lobby case that religious freedom law “doesn’t just apply to protect popular religious beliefs: it does perhaps its most important work in protecting unpopular religious beliefs, vindicating this nation’s long-held aspiration to serve as a refuge of religious tolerance.”

'Faith has played a big part in our lives'

Besides the observation that he is clearly a man of faith, Gorsuch’s own religious leanings aren’t that clear. He was raised Catholic and attended Catholic schools, but now attends a progressive Episcopal church in Boulder, Colo. Comments from family members and friends give the impression of a man who is quietly, but deeply, spiritual.

Coons acknowledges that, and adds that “it’s my responsibility to keep an open mind.”

“We’re both people for whom faith has played a big part in our lives,” he says. But “we may reach very different conclusions about what that means for the judicial role in privileging religious freedom over individual autonomy.”

“I genuinely enjoyed my [earlier] meetings with Judge Gorsuch,” he adds. “He’s a very engaging person, but I haven’t reached any conclusions yet.”

In his statement on Monday, Coons pointed to “disturbing trends in affronts to religious liberty,” including President Trump’s campaign promise of a “Muslim ban” and the Justice Department’s withdrawal of guidance allowing transgender students to use the bathroom that matches their gender identity.

“I am considering your nomination with an open mind, and I would ask that you would be forthcoming in your responses,” he said.

“I believe we must balance our respect for the significance of faith and free exercise with concerns about impacts on other's liberty,” he added. “America needs a Supreme Court justice who will protect the Constitution, not one who will countenance faith or fear of some, as a justification for infringing the liberty of many.”",www.csmonitor.com,center,VrGpbOXWUG2T4mLF

WESTAMPTON, N.J. — A man who leaned over a plate of sizzling fajitas to pray can't sue a Westampton restaurant because the dish burned him, an appellate court ruled Wednesday.

Hiram Jimenez sought damages from Applebee's Neighborhood Grill and Bar after a March 2010 incident at the chain's restaurant on Burlington-Mount Holly Road. But an appellate panel said Applebee's can't be held responsible because the hot food posed an ""open and obvious"" danger.

According to the ruling, Jimenez ordered fajitas that were placed in front of him in a ""sizzling skillet."" When he bowed his head ""close to the table,"" the ruling says, Jimenez heard ""a loud sizzling noise, followed by 'a pop noise' and then felt a burning sensation in his left eye and on his face.""

In an incident report prepared for Appelebee's, Jimenez said he was burned on his face, neck and arms after ""grease popped"" on the fajitas.

His lawsuit said a waitress did not warn Jimenez that the dish was hot. It argued Jimenez suffered ""serious and permanent"" injuries ""solely as a result of (Applebee's) negligence when he came in contact with a dangerous and hazardous condition, specifically, 'a plate of hot food'.""

A trial judge dismissed the suit, finding Applebee's — a California-based chain with more than 1,900 restaurants — was not required to warn Jimenez ""against a danger that is open and obvious.""

Jimenez appealed, but a two-judge panel came to the same conclusion.
