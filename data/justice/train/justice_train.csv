Here is our full conversation , prior to Sessions ’ s recusal announcement , lightly edited for clarity .
How do you understand Attorney General Jeff Sessions ’ s Senate testimony and the reports that followed ?
He said they had not had talks with Russians during the political campaign . And now he says , well , what he meant to say was that he had not had contact with the Russians to discuss the political campaign . But that ’ s not what he said .
And if he had contact with the Russians as a United States senator , as a member of the Armed Services Committee , he needed to disclose that and qualify that answer . Then of course he would have had to answer questions about what those conversations were . I will add that it is unusual for a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee to be conducting these types of unilateral discussions with the Russian ambassador . And I think we can rest assured that the Russians have very detailed notes of these conversations or tape recordings of them .
[ Sessions ] misled the Senate , and the Senate was entitled to find out about the communications with the Russians .
Would you say Jeff Sessions committed perjury , or is there some wiggle room ?
This is one of those situations where the testimony was highly misleading . Whether or not it amounts to perjury is debatable . Of course , we had a situation with President Clinton 20 years ago where he was never prosecuted for perjury even though he gave a highly misleading testimony in a civil deposition .
The difference here , of course , is that this is a matter of extreme national importance — what the Russians are doing in the United States and who ’ s been contacting the Russians . Whereas the president ’ s personal sex life is not of importance at all to the American people . [ But ] there are still consequences of such actions , particularly when it comes to issues of national security .
It ’ s very rare for these kinds of perjury cases to move forward . What ’ s the precedent here ?
Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , under the Bush administration , did resign from his post because some members of Congress felt his testimony was misleading — he was never prosecuted for anything . His testimony was never so misleading that he could be prosecuted even with a failure to provide information to Congress . [ But ] it was sufficiently dubious that he did end up resigning .
The attorney general of Richard Nixon , Richard Kleindienst , in 1972 in his own confirmation hearing was asked whether there had been discussions between himself and the White House about a pending antitrust case brought by DOJ against ITT [ International Telephone and Telegraph ] , and Kleindienst said no . And then Leon Jaworski uncovered the Nixon tapes where the president told Kleindienst to drop the ITT case .
Kleindienst ’ s excuse there was that he thought the question in the Senate was about a different time frame than the one in which he communicated with the president — a quite pale excuse . But what ended up happening was that Jaworski prosecuted Kleindienst for crimes of failure to provide accurate information to Congress , which is a misdemeanor — which , of course , falls short of perjury , which is a felony .
Kleindienst was forced to resign as attorney general and was reprimanded by the Arizona bar . There is precedent for this type of testimony which [ is ] misleading , which may not be a blatant lie that amounts to perjury but is more in the debatable category .
The facts now in this investigation are much worse than the facts in the early stages of Watergate , which was a simple break-in ordered by midlevel campaign officials — not by the president .

What have you made of the White House ’ s response to this ? You were the ethics lawyer under the Bush administration — are they following the guidance you would have given in this situation ?
I don ’ t see much of a response . They are blowing it off . It ’ s very clear President Trump needs to immediately find out who in his campaign had any communications with the Russians about anything . Find out what those communications were to the best of his ability and find out who in the administration knew what the Russians were doing . He needs to support a thorough inquiry , not a cover-up — that is the mistake Nixon made with Watergate .
Their public comments have been atrocious so far . They keep accusing CNN of fake news ; then the spokesperson for the Kremlin accuses CNN of fake news . What we are seeing is the White House putting themselves on the same page as the Kremlin , when they [ the Russians ] have been spying on the United States and attacked our democratic system in 2016 . That is a terrible posture they are in . They need to do a complete reversal here .
Don ’ t cover it up . Get the people out that collaborated with the Russians , have a thorough investigation . If there is something that Putin has that is embarrassing to Donald Trump , just tell it to us . They certainly shouldn ’ t be repeating phrases like “ fake news ” that are being repeated by the Kremlin to attack the American media . That is exactly the wrong approach .

I have been a Republican for decades , and the one thing that Republicans and Democrats should have in common is concern about our national security . And in particular the attempts by Russia over the decades — going back to the 1920s — to subvert our government by supporting extremist groups like the American Communist Party , or now white supremacist groups .
This is not a Democratic and Republican issue , and figuring out who in our government is cooperating with the Russians is of the utmost importance . We certainly don ’ t need a McCarthy-type witch hunt , and this shouldn ’ t be abused for political purposes , but it ’ s a critically important issue , and Democrats and Republicans can be united on this . And I certainly don ’ t think the Republican Party should become a pro-Putin party . If it is , we are going to have sort ourselves out .
With a recusal , are there still concerns with an independent review of the Trump campaign ’ s potential ties to Russia ? If so , where ?
At this point , he can ’ t have anything to do with the investigation . It needs to be an independent prosecutor , and can not report to the attorney general and should not be someone who reports to someone who reports to the attorney general .
We absolutely need to find out what happened with the Russians , but this attorney general is not equipped to do that . He is conflicted out .
Do you think this could go further than recusal ? Indictment ?
That ’ s way down the road here . At this point , given the facts we have now , I don ’ t think [ Sessions ] could continue as attorney general . Certainly if he were indicted , he would be forced to step down as attorney general . You don ’ t need indictable conduct for an attorney general to step down .
This may very well fall into the category of what Bill Clinton did or Attorney General Kleindienst did — something falling short of perjury . We will deal with that when we get to it .

The agency’s myriad problems include ignoring many taxpayers’ calls and succumbing last year to a massive computer hack in which hundreds of thousands of taxpayers’ most sensitive information was stolen from IRS computers.

The agency continues to grapple with fallout from the tea party targeting. An inspector general said hundreds of groups’ applications for nonprofit status derailed while the IRS put them through intense scrutiny.

Some groups dropped out rather than face the inquiry, while others battled. At least two groups have been awaiting a decision for more than five years.

IRS officials acknowledged they erred but said the problem was bad training and confusion about a 2010 Supreme Court decision, not an intent to target groups for political purposes. The agency says it tried to follow all nine of the inspector general’s regulations for cleaning up its act.

“IRS responded enthusiastically,” said Judith A. Hagley, the Justice Department lawyer representing the IRS.

The judges Thursday were not convinced.

“How much has really changed?” said Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg.

A lower-court judge sided with the IRS, saying that since most groups were approved, the targeting has stopped. That judge tossed the cases, saying they were now moot.

But the tea party groups pointed to a report last year by the Government Accountability Office that said conservative nonprofit groups were still more likely to face follow-up audits from the IRS, evidence that political targeting was continuing.

justice,Mother Jones,0,https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2019/10/kamala-harris-climate-investigation/,Kamala Harris Says She’ll Prosecute Oil Companies and Utilities for Role in Climate Crisis,,"Rebecca Leber, Will Peischel, Abigail Weinberg, David Corn, Dan Friedman, Matt Cohen, Inae Oh, Molly Schwartz, David Beard","California Senator and 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful Kamala Harris believes the next commander in chief should hold fossil fuel companies accountable for misleading the public about climate change—and she wants to use the full force of the federal government to do so . In an exclusive interview with ███ last week in Dubuque , Iowa , she promised to mobilize the Department of Justice and the EPA to ensure “ that we ’ re going to put pressure on the big companies to do what is required and what is responsible . ”
“ We ’ re going to put pressure on the big companies to do what is required and what is responsible . ”
Asked if the federal government should play a role in investigating fossil fuel companies , Harris said “ absolutely , ” adding “ let ’ s get them not only in the pocket book , but let ’ s make sure there are severe and serious penalties for their behaviors . ”
One of those companies , Harris suggested , could be California ’ s largest utility , Pacific Gas & Electric ( PG & E ) . Earlier this month , PG & E cut the power to an estimated two million people in an effort to minimize its chances of causing a catastrophic fire ; last year ’ s Camp Fire killed 86 people and tipped PG & E into bankruptcy . In recent years , PG & E has invested heavily in renewables , but from 1989 to 1991 , the utility was part of the campaign to delay and derail climate action through the Global Climate Coalition , a group of industry groups that worked to delay and derail regulation through 2002 .
“ Everyone that was part of misinforming the public , misleading the public , and false advertising should be held accountable , ” she says . “ There is , in my vision of the future , a very important role for utilities to play in being held accountable . ”
This was the first time Harris has weighed in on the utility ’ s role after power shut-offs in her home state . In the climate plan she released in September , she promised to flip the switch on Trump-era environmental rollbacks , then implement her own brand of the Green New Deal , a $ 10 trillion investment plan to equip the country for a carbon-neutral future—she hopes by 2045 .
The senator has a less substantial environmental record than some opponents—most notably Bernie Sanders—but she has spoken out about the importance of cleaning up pollution in poor communities . Her Climate Equity Act would assign a score to bills and regulations that judges their impacts on vulnerable places .
Harris has also been sure to emphasize her experience as a prosecutor , when she oversaw the California Department of Justice . From 2011 to 2017 , her office sued several major oil and gas companies for pollution . But last month , during a climate change town hall , Harris claimed to have directed the California Attorney General ’ s office to sue Exxon Mobil in 2016 for misleading the public about the dangers of climate change . In fact , the department only opened an investigation that eventually went nowhere .
The litigation over climate denial and who bears responsibility is still an open question : Exxon is currently on trial in the New York Supreme Court over whether it misled shareholders over climate change impacts , and the Supreme Court will allow the city of Baltimore ’ s case against major oil companies to proceed in state court . These cases and others could persist well into the next administration .
And for that reason , Harris says that she will choose her cabinet members in part based on their commitment to fighting climate change—even for positions outside the EPA . “ The president of the United States gets to appoint her cabinet , ” she says . “ And for me this issue of the climate crisis relates to every aspect of what we do . ”","California Senator and 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful Kamala Harris believes the next commander in chief should hold fossil fuel companies accountable for misleading the public about climate change—and she wants to use the full force of the federal government to do so.

From 2011 to 2017, her office sued several major oil and gas companies for pollution. But last month, during a climate change town hall, Harris claimed to have directed the California Attorney General’s office to sue Exxon Mobil in 2016 for misleading the public about the dangers of climate change. In fact, the department only opened an investigation that eventually went nowhere.

The litigation over climate denial and who bears responsibility is still an open question: Exxon is currently on trial in the New York Supreme Court over whether it misled shareholders over climate change impacts, and the Supreme Court will allow the city of Baltimore’s case against major oil companies to proceed in state court. These cases and others could persist well into the next administration.

And for that reason, Harris says that she will choose her cabinet members in part based on their commitment to fighting climate change—even for positions outside the EPA. “The president of the United States gets to appoint her cabinet,” she says. “And for me this issue of the climate crisis relates to every aspect of what we do.”",www.motherjones.com,left,l99pVzUVpUCBh0xm

Midkiff has now restarted his life : A full-time paralegal in Ocala , Florida , and the president of the board of a national organization providing legal help to incarcerated people , he begins his busy workdays at 5 a.m. And last month , he proposed to his fiancée , Marianna Kuchma , on the beach .
But Midkiff may not have his freedom much longer . Because of a legal dispute over the wording of his 1997 plea agreement for his role in a murder—and despite the fact that he has not committed any new offenses—a Florida court on July 2 ordered him to report back to the Department of Corrections to spend 15 more years in prison . He was given 15 days to challenge the decision .
In its ruling , the 5th District Court of Appeal noted that Midkiff was a legal adult at the time of his crime , not a juvenile deserving of more lenient treatment . At the same time , the court acknowledged in a footnote that Midkiff appeared to have completed his prison time in a “ remarkably favorable way ” and to be a model of rehabilitation .
His former warden agrees . Midkiff is the “ very embodiment of how we would all ideally want the justice system to transform people into productive , loving citizens , ” said Kim Southerland , who ran Marion Correctional Institution when Midkiff was serving much of his sentence there .
A warrant could be issued to take Midkiff back into custody as early as this week , though he is seeking a stay while he pursues an appeal . With the clock ticking , he is scrambling to get his fiancée ’ s engagement ring resized and to pay his elderly mother ’ s bills—he worries that he may never see her again as a free man .
And along with grappling with the possibility of “ going right back to a place where I was told what I can eat , when I can shower , how I can interact with my family , ” Midkiff said , he knows a new danger awaits him in prison : “ I haven ’ t even gotten around to contemplating how I ’ m headed into a COVID-19 breeding ground . ”
In 1996 , when Midkiff was 19 , he and a 17-year-old acquaintance robbed a man in the Orlando area who they thought would have drugs . Midkiff sat in the getaway car while his friend , J. Patrick Swett , went inside the home with a gun . “ This doesn ’ t take away either of our guilt , which I have been trying to reckon with ever since , but nowhere in the realm of possibility did I think he would shoot this person , ” Midkiff said .
Both Midkiff and Swett were charged with first-degree murder ; under the legal doctrine of “ felony murder , ” anyone involved in a crime that turns into a homicide can be charged with the killing even if they didn ’ t pull the trigger . Midkiff agreed to plead guilty to second-degree murder and spend 38 years in prison .
The victim ’ s family , according to court records , wanted the shooter to get a longer sentence than Midkiff , so the judge gave Swett 38 and a half years . ( Neither the victim ’ s family nor Swett , who was also released from prison , could be reached for comment . )
In prison , Midkiff by all accounts transformed himself . He started a program called Story Time Dads , which helped incarcerated fathers record videos of themselves reading books so that their children at home could read along with them . He was also the creator and program coordinator of a prison school called SAGE , which provided dozens of classes on topics including public speaking , interviewing , financial literacy , real estate , creative writing and philosophy .
“ I even started going to him for help—I ’ d ask him , Can you build a new program for me to meet this need , or can you work with these inmates ? ” said Southerland , the former warden .
Midkiff also became a certified law clerk and one of the most prolific “ jailhouse lawyers ” in Florida , according to his advocates across the state .
So he took note when the U.S. Supreme Court issued a series of rulings in the 2010s declaring that prisoners who were sentenced to decades behind bars as juveniles—meaning under 18—deserve to have their sentences reviewed to see if they had grown out of the adolescent mindset that contributed to their crime .
Midkiff ’ s co-defendant , Swett , who was 17 at the time of the crime , sought such a review and was granted a new sentence : time served . He was freed in 2018 .
With the help of an outside attorney , Midkiff immediately filed a motion saying that the original plea agreement , as requested by the victim ’ s family and verbally agreed upon by all parties , said that the shooter should get more prison time than the getaway driver . Therefore , if Swett ’ s sentence was being shortened , so should his . ( The victim ’ s family did not attend Midkiff ’ s hearing to fight his release . )
A judge agreed with Midkiff ’ s argument , and he was released in June 2019 .
Going free after more than two decades “ was kind of like being a newborn except knowing how to walk and how to speak , ” Midkiff said . Once , when he was waiting to cross a street , he jumped when he heard a robotic voice coming from the traffic light say , “ Don ’ t walk ! ” His first night sleeping in a friend ’ s house , in a room with a soft bed and a door that he could open himself , he nearly had a panic attack .
On Midkiff ’ s first Friday out , he went to dinner with Kuchma , who had been writing to him for years after being introduced to him by her mother , who was a prison volunteer . ( The day she had planned to come see him in prison for the first time happened to be the day after he was released ; he had to call her to tell her that he was free and to cancel the visit . ) They ’ ve been together ever since .
They both knew that the Florida attorney general ’ s office had filed an appeal opposing Midkiff ’ s release , but they were not concerned . The trial court judge had ruled strongly in Midkiff ’ s favor , and he had strong evidence of his rehabilitation—support from prison staff and volunteers , as well as colleagues on the outside .
Since his release , Midkiff has worked on hundreds of legal cases , with a special interest in those involving juveniles . He ’ s also still in touch with his former warden , who asks him “ about ideas for how to help these guys , ” Southerland said . “ Which he doesn ’ t have to do . He could just move on with his life and forget prison . ”
In February , Midkiff flew to New York City to speak to law students at New York University about his jailhouse lawyer work .
“ He was so generous with his knowledge , ” said Sukti Dhital , executive director of the NYU School of Law ’ s Robert and Helen Bernstein Institute for Human Rights , who invited Midkiff . “ This story is not just about him but about all those he ’ s served and continues to serve . ”
Through NYU , Midkiff became board president of the Legal Empowerment and Advocacy Hub , which works to democratize the law by helping incarcerated people and pre-trial defendants themselves use it .
Apart from his work , Midkiff has spent the past year enjoying nonprison food and convincing Kuchma ’ s mother and siblings to let him marry her .
But then , after a year of freedom and just weeks after getting engaged , Midkiff ’ s lawyer called him . “ I have bad news , ” Mark O ’ Mara said simply .
The appeals court had found that the language saying that Swett should get more prison time than Midkiff was written in Swett ’ s plea deal , not Midkiff ’ s . Therefore , Midkiff had no legal grounds to benefit from it .
Midkiff had long believed in the legal system—and he had trained himself while incarcerated not to cry . But the tears came quickly .
It all rushed back : “ The 23 years of smells , of sounds , of fears , frustrations , regrets and the great losses of being in prison , ” he said .

Undergirding the court ’ s ruling is the idea that Midkiff , who was a year into being a legal adult at the time of the crime , should not be able to benefit from Supreme Court rulings that said juveniles sent to prison for decades should get a second chance .
“ Juvenile resentencing is not newly discovered evidence ” in an adult ’ s case , the appeals court ruled .
But many experts on crimes committed by teenagers question the basis of the hard line that the court system draws at age 18 . Brain science shows that there is no or very little difference between a 17-year-old and a 19-year-old in terms of impulse control , risk taking , being easily influenced by peer pressure and considering the consequences of one ’ s actions .
“ There is no magic birthday when someone transitions from a child to an adult , ” said Lael E.H. Chester , director of the Emerging Adult Justice Project at the Columbia University Justice Lab , which focuses on 18- to 25-year-olds .
Midkiff ’ s case captures many aspects of what ’ s wrong with the American system of punishing young people , youth advocates said . For instance , the notion that everyone involved in a crime , even the driver , should be charged equally : This especially affects teens , who tend to be influenced to do more impulsive , negative things when they ’ re in groups , research shows . And then there ’ s the notion of thinking of sentences as a strict number of years to be enforced no matter what , ignoring any rehabilitation that has occurred .
Midkiff and his legal team are pursuing a few strategies to keep him out of prison in a state where COVID-19 cases are spiking and 175 percent more common behind bars . But they are running short on time .
The first option would be to get Gov . Ron DeSantis , a Republican , and the state clemency board to commute his sentence . Midkiff had filed a petition for clemency while he was in prison , but once he got out , he assumed it was no longer necessary and let the application lapse ; his lawyers are trying to update it and get it back on the governor ’ s desk .
Kuchma ’ s family members have all written to DeSantis pleading with him to help “ Richie , ” as they call their soon-to-be in-law . “ Our family has embraced him and have a deep respect for who he is today , ” her mother wrote . “ The grandchildren look up to him ! I have never seen my daughter so happy . ”
DeSantis ’ office did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
A spokeswoman for the state attorney general ’ s office , which argued in a brief that Midkiff ’ s original plea deal did not entitle him to a shorter sentence , said in an emailed statement that nothing precludes him from seeking clemency “ considering the unique circumstances of his case. ” She declined to comment further because the case is ongoing .
The other possible route to continuing Midkiff ’ s freedom is through the courts . A three-judge panel of the appeals court decided that he should return to prison ; now he will try convincing either the full court or the Florida Supreme Court , or even a federal court , to take up the case .
If he gets a hearing , Midkiff ’ s legal team said that he would make an argument based on the common-law concept of “ manifest injustice ” : the idea that a ruling that might be internally logical should still be overturned if the resulting unfairness is so clear and directly observable it is shocking to the conscience .
“ I am already free , ” Midkiff said . “ But now it feels like any minute the cops could show up and take me back . ”","By the time Richard Midkiff walked out of a Florida prison last year at age 42, he had spent more than half his life behind bars for a crime he committed when he was 19.

Lee, Christopher S. Stewart, Rob Barry, Shane Harris, Carol.Lee Wsj.Com, Christopher.Stewart Wsj.Com, Rob.Barry Wsj.Com","WASHINGTON—U.S . investigators have examined contacts Attorney General Jeff Sessions had with Russian officials during the time he was advising Donald Trump ’ s presidential campaign , according to people familiar with the matter .
The outcome of the inquiry , and whether it is ongoing , wasn ’ t clear , these people said . The contacts were being examined as part of a wide-ranging U.S. counterintelligence investigation into possible communications between members of Mr. Trump ’ s campaign team and Russian operatives , they said .
The Federal Bureau of Investigation , which has been leading the investigation , didn ’ t immediately respond to a request for comment . The White House directed requests for comment to the Justice Department .
But disclosures about Mr. Sessions ’ contacts led quickly late Wednesday to demands that he step aside from any investigation involving the Trump administration , or that he resign for failing to tell the truth during his confirmation hearing .
“ If there is something there and it goes up the chain of investigation , it is clear to me that Jeff Sessions , who is my dear friend , can not make this decision about Trump , ” said Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R. , S.C. ) , adding that a special prosecutor might be needed .
Mr . Sessions , in a statement placed on Twitter late Wednesday by his spokeswoman , said : “ I never met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign . I have no idea what this allegation is about . It is false . ”
During his confirmation hearing for attorney general in January , Mr . Sessions , a Republican senator from Alabama , testified under oath that he had no contact with Russian officials as a campaign surrogate and never discussed the 2016 election with Russian officials .
But Mr . Sessions spoke with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. , Sergei Kislyak , while the Republican National Convention was under way in Cleveland last summer , according to his spokeswoman , Sarah Flores . He also spoke with Mr. Kislyak on another occasion last year , in a meeting in his Senate office , she said , clarifying that the meeting was in person and not on the phone as she had initially said .
Ms. Flores said the contact last July occurred when Mr . Sessions spoke at a Heritage Foundation event attended by Mr. Kislyak in Cleveland , appearing in his capacity as a senator , not a campaign official . She said several ambassadors approached Mr . Sessions after his speech at the Heritage Foundation event , including Mr. Kislyak .
She said the attorney general wasn ’ t aware that his communications have been under investigation .
During his confirmation hearing in January , Mr . Sessions was asked what he would do if any evidence emerged that someone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government during the campaign and said : “ I ’ m not aware of any of those activities . ”
“ I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I didn ’ t have—did not have communications with the Russians , and I ’ m unable to comment on it , ” he said .
Ms. Flores said Mr . Sessions wasn ’ t required to disclose the contacts because they took place in his capacity as a senator , not a campaign official .
“ The attorney general has been very clear that as a senator he had conversations with the Russian ambassador , ” Ms. Flores said in a statement . “ Last year , the senator had over 25 conversations with foreign ambassadors as a senior member of the Armed Services Committee , including the British , Korean , Japanese , Polish , Indian , Chinese , Canadian , Australian , German and Russian ambassadors . ”
The focus of the U.S. counterintelligence investigation has been on communications between Trump campaign officials and Russia . The inquiry involving Mr . Sessions is examining his contacts while serving as Mr. Trump ’ s foreign-policy adviser in the spring and summer of 2016 , one person familiar with the matter said .
The investigation is being pursued by the FBI , Central Intelligence Agency , National Security Agency and Treasury Department , officials have said . Counterintelligence probes seldom lead to public accusations or criminal charges .
However , the probe , if ongoing , could create a highly unusual and sensitive political dynamic given that the FBI is part of the Justice Department that Mr . Sessions , as attorney general , now leads . Mr . Sessions has only been in office for under a month and the investigation began before he was nominated and approved by the Senate .
The FBI ’ s role in the investigation into Mr. Sessions ’ conversations left the agency “ wringing its hands ” about how to proceed , said one person familiar with the matter .
Mr. Trump asked for the resignation of his national security adviser , Mike Flynn , after Mr. Flynn misled Vice President Mike Pence over the nature of a conversation he had in December with Russia ’ s ambassador to the U.S .
The White House has denied any inappropriate interactions between associates of Mr. Trump and Russian officials . Asked during a news conference in February if anyone advising his campaign had contact with Russia during the campaign , Mr. Trump said “ nobody that I know of . ”
Committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate are investigating Russia ’ s alleged involvement in the election campaign and possible ties or communication between Russian officials and the Trump campaign .
Russia has denied interfering in the U.S. election , blaming accusations on American politicians who want to sabotage relations between the two countries .
Some Republicans contend that the Russia investigations are politically motivated and are being pushed by people who were furious that the FBI , led by its director , James Comey , continued to investigate Hillary Clinton ’ s emails late into the 2016 election campaign . These Republicans say that the Russia investigations will prove to be without foundation .
Until this week , Mr . Sessions had resisted calls to remove himself from any role investigating possible ties between Trump associates and Russia . Democrats have said he should do so because of his place advising the Trump campaign .
On Monday , he suggested he would take himself off a case under certain circumstances , though he left out any specifics . Mr . Sessions told reporters he would “ recuse myself on anything that I should recuse myself on , that ’ s all I can tell you . ”
Late Wednesday , a number of Democrats , including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( D. , Calif. ) and Rep. Elijah Cummings ( D. , Md . ) , said Mr . Sessions should resign for failing to disclose his contacts with Russian officials .
As a senator , Mr . Sessions was a sharp critic of Russia . He supported kicking the country out of the Group of Eight summit and called for sanctions against Moscow for its 2014 invasion of Ukraine .
“ I believe a systematic effort should be undertaken so that Russia feels pain for this , ” Mr . Sessions said at the time .
But his rhetoric softened after he endorsed Mr. Trump , and he advocated better relations with Russia .
Mr . Sessions joined the Trump campaign in February 2016 at a rally in the former senator ’ s home state of Alabama . Within days , Mr. Trump named him chairman of his campaign ’ s national-security advisory committee .
It is unclear whether anyone in Congress knew about the investigation into Mr. Sessions ’ Russian interactions before Mr . Sessions was confirmed .
The investigation into Mr. Sessions ’ communications comes amid calls from Democrats and some Republicans for an independent inquiry into the possible cooperation between the Trump campaign and the Russian government to influence the 2016 election , particularly through cyberattacks .
U.S. intelligence agencies already concluded that Russia hacked the Democratic National Committee and the personal email account of Hillary Clinton ’ s campaign chairman , John Podesta . Emails from both were released on the website WikiLeaks .
At first , Mr. Trump disputed that assessment , but later said : “ I think it was Russia , but we also get hacked by other countries . ”
Justice Department regulations require the attorney general to remove himself from investigations that present a real or perceived conflict of interest . But ultimately , there is no practical mechanism , other than public pressure or an impeachment proceeding , to force the matter .
The law has changed since wide-ranging probes into the Clinton administration , when a three-judge panel could appoint an “ independent counsel ” or a “ special prosecutor. ” Today , the attorney general retains far more control over the scope of a special investigation and its prosecutorial jurisdiction .
Mr . Sessions can also appoint a temporary “ special counsel ” from outside the Justice Department to conduct an investigation into a particularly sensitive matter and possibly prosecute related wrongdoing .
The last name of Jeff Sessions was incorrectly given as Session in an earlier version of this article . ( March 2 )","WASHINGTON—U.S. investigators have examined contacts Attorney General Jeff Sessions had with Russian officials during the time he was advising Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, according to people familiar with the matter.

During his confirmation hearing in January, Mr. Sessions was asked what he would do if any evidence emerged that someone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government during the campaign and said: “I’m not aware of any of those activities.”

“I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I didn’t have—did not have communications with the Russians, and I’m unable to comment on it,” he said.

Ms. Flores said Mr. Sessions wasn’t required to disclose the contacts because they took place in his capacity as a senator, not a campaign official.

“The attorney general has been very clear that as a senator he had conversations with the Russian ambassador,” Ms. Flores said in a statement. “Last year, the senator had over 25 conversations with foreign ambassadors as a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, including the British, Korean, Japanese, Polish, Indian, Chinese, Canadian, Australian, German and Russian ambassadors.”

The focus of the U.S. counterintelligence investigation has been on communications between Trump campaign officials and Russia. The inquiry involving Mr. Sessions is examining his contacts while serving as Mr. Trump’s foreign-policy adviser in the spring and summer of 2016, one person familiar with the matter said.

The investigation is being pursued by the FBI, Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency and Treasury Department, officials have said. Counterintelligence probes seldom lead to public accusations or criminal charges.

However, the probe, if ongoing, could create a highly unusual and sensitive political dynamic given that the FBI is part of the Justice Department that Mr. Sessions, as attorney general, now leads. Mr. Sessions has only been in office for under a month and the investigation began before he was nominated and approved by the Senate.

The FBI’s role in the investigation into Mr. Sessions’ conversations left the agency “wringing its hands” about how to proceed, said one person familiar with the matter.

Mr. Trump asked for the resignation of his national security adviser, Mike Flynn, after Mr. Flynn misled Vice President Mike Pence over the nature of a conversation he had in December with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S.

The White House has denied any inappropriate interactions between associates of Mr. Trump and Russian officials. Asked during a news conference in February if anyone advising his campaign had contact with Russia during the campaign, Mr. Trump said “nobody that I know of.”

Committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate are investigating Russia’s alleged involvement in the election campaign and possible ties or communication between Russian officials and the Trump campaign.

Russia has denied interfering in the U.S. election, blaming accusations on American politicians who want to sabotage relations between the two countries.

Some Republicans contend that the Russia investigations are politically motivated and are being pushed by people who were furious that the FBI, led by its director, James Comey, continued to investigate Hillary Clinton’s emails late into the 2016 election campaign. These Republicans say that the Russia investigations will prove to be without foundation.

Until this week, Mr. Sessions had resisted calls to remove himself from any role investigating possible ties between Trump associates and Russia. Democrats have said he should do so because of his place advising the Trump campaign.

On Monday, he suggested he would take himself off a case under certain circumstances, though he left out any specifics. Mr. Sessions told reporters he would “recuse myself on anything that I should recuse myself on, that’s all I can tell you.”

Late Wednesday, a number of Democrats, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) and Rep. Elijah Cummings (D., Md.), said Mr. Sessions should resign for failing to disclose his contacts with Russian officials.

As a senator, Mr. Sessions was a sharp critic of Russia. He supported kicking the country out of the Group of Eight summit and called for sanctions against Moscow for its 2014 invasion of Ukraine.

“I believe a systematic effort should be undertaken so that Russia feels pain for this,” Mr. Sessions said at the time.

But his rhetoric softened after he endorsed Mr. Trump, and he advocated better relations with Russia.

Mr. Sessions joined the Trump campaign in February 2016 at a rally in the former senator’s home state of Alabama. Within days, Mr. Trump named him chairman of his campaign’s national-security advisory committee.

It is unclear whether anyone in Congress knew about the investigation into Mr. Sessions’ Russian interactions before Mr. Sessions was confirmed.

The investigation into Mr. Sessions’ communications comes amid calls from Democrats and some Republicans for an independent inquiry into the possible cooperation between the Trump campaign and the Russian government to influence the 2016 election, particularly through cyberattacks.

U.S. intelligence agencies already concluded that Russia hacked the Democratic National Committee and the personal email account of Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta. Emails from both were released on the website WikiLeaks.

At first, Mr. Trump disputed that assessment, but later said: “I think it was Russia, but we also get hacked by other countries.”

Justice Department regulations require the attorney general to remove himself from investigations that present a real or perceived conflict of interest. But ultimately, there is no practical mechanism, other than public pressure or an impeachment proceeding, to force the matter.

The law has changed since wide-ranging probes into the Clinton administration, when a three-judge panel could appoint an “independent counsel” or a “special prosecutor.” Today, the attorney general retains far more control over the scope of a special investigation and its prosecutorial jurisdiction.

Mr. Sessions can also appoint a temporary “special counsel” from outside the Justice Department to conduct an investigation into a particularly sensitive matter and possibly prosecute related wrongdoing.

justice,NPR Online News,1,https://www.npr.org/2018/12/09/643444815/all-the-criminal-charges-to-emerge-so-far-from-robert-muellers-investigation,All The Criminal Charges To Emerge So Far From Robert Mueller's Investigation,2018-12-09,Jason Breslow,"All The Criminal Charges To Emerge From Robert Mueller 's Investigation
After nearly two years of work , special counsel Robert Mueller 's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election has officially drawn to a close . Mueller has submitted his findings to Attorney General William Barr , marking the end of an investigation that has resulted in criminal charges against 34 individuals . To date , the special counsel has secured seven guilty pleas and one conviction at trial , but 25 Russians indicted by Mueller are unlikely to ever see a U.S. courtroom .
Among those ensnared by the probe have been the president 's former personal attorney , officials from his 2016 campaign , former aides and advisers and members of Russian intelligence services . While the long-term political implications of the investigation remain far from certain , it has already generated new insights into how Russia targeted the 2016 election , the presidential transition and the Trump family 's business empire .
Roger Stone , a longtime informal adviser to President Trump and self-proclaimed `` dirty trickster , '' was arrested by FBI agents at his home in Florida and charged with seven counts , including obstruction , witness tampering and making false statements in relation to Russian interference in the 2016 election .
The special counsel 's indictment alleges that Stone was in regular contact with WikiLeaks ( identified in the indictment as `` Organization 1 '' ) and the Trump campaign at key moments as stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign were being released to the public ahead of Election Day in 2016 . The timing of these communications , prosecutors allege , suggests officials in the Trump campaign knew ahead of time that WikiLeaks had stolen the emails and was prepared to leak them .
`` After the July 22 , 2016 release of stolen DNC emails by Organization 1 , a senior Trump Campaign official was directed to contact Stone about any additional releases and what other damaging information Organization 1 had regarding the Clinton Campaign . ''
The indictment says Stone `` thereafter told the Trump Campaign about potential future releases . ''
As NPR 's Philip Ewing and Tamara Keith note , the indictment was the first to charge an American in relation to the theft and release of stolen Democratic Party emails . Moreover , `` it shows Mueller wants to try to prove that at least one person in the Trump campaign 's orbit colluded with Russian 's election interference . ''
Stone , who pleaded not guilty , has repeatedly denied that he played any role in helping the Russian attack on the 2016 election . In May , he told NPR that the special counsel was `` following a fake news narrative , which continues to repeat incorrectly that I had advance knowledge of the content source or exact timing of the WikiLeaks disclosures . ''
President Trump 's former campaign chairman pleaded guilty in September 2018 to conspiracy against the United States and conspiracy to obstruct justice — charges that stemmed from a range of alleged crimes committed over more than a decade as a lobbyist and , later , a member of the Trump campaign .
In pleading guilty , Manafort agreed to cooperate with the Mueller investigation . Less than three months later , though , the special counsel 's office told a federal judge in Washington , D.C. , that he had `` breached the plea agreement . ''
Manafort 's attorneys insist he gave the government useful information , but prosecutors said Manafort committed new crimes `` by lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Special Counsel 's Office on a variety of subject matters . ''
U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson ruled that Manafort had intentionally lied to the special counsel 's office , which meant Mueller 's team was no longer bound by the plea agreement .
At sentencing , Jackson ordered Manafort to serve 43 months in federal prison on top of the 47 months he was sentenced to serve in a separate case brought by the special counsel in Virginia . In all , he will serve just under 7 1/2 years .
In the Virginia case — the first to reach trial for the Mueller investigation — prosecutors accused Manafort of failing to pay taxes on millions of dollars that he earned as a consultant for pro-Russia politicians in Ukraine and kept hidden from the IRS .
The jury found Manafort guilty of eight counts in the sprawling tax and bank fraud case but deadlocked on 10 others , prompting U.S. District Judge T.S . Ellis III to declare a mistrial on those charges .
Manafort had been facing as much as 24 years in prison , but Ellis told the court that such a penalty would have been `` excessive , '' adding that Manafort had lived `` an otherwise blameless life . ''
In her sentencing decision , Jackson broke from that assessment . `` It is hard to overstate the number of lies and the amount of fraud involved , '' she said of Manafort 's case . `` A significant portion of his career has been spent gaming the system , '' she also said .
At one time , lawyer Michael Cohen said he would `` take a bullet '' for Donald Trump . But by pleading guilty in November 2018 to lying to Congress , Cohen raised new questions about Trump 's business interests in Russia during a pivotal period of the 2016 presidential campaign .
Cohen admitted that he lied when he told Congress that discussions about a potential Trump Tower project in Moscow ended in January 2016 . Actually , he said , they continued through June of that year .
According to court documents , Cohen also initially said that his overtures to the Russian government went unrequited , but as talks progressed , he eventually heard back from a top aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin : Dmitry Peskov .
Cohen also pleaded guilty in August 2018 to five counts of tax evasion , one count of falsifying submissions to a bank and two campaign finance violations — a plea that directly implicated the president .
The campaign finance violations stem from two payments that Cohen helped arrange ahead of Election Day 2016 to buy the silence of former Playboy model Karen McDougal and adult film actress Stephanie Clifford , also known as Stormy Daniels . The women say they had sexual relationships with Trump .
Trump has acknowledged that he reimbursed Cohen for a $ 130,000 payment to Clifford — but denies the alleged relationships with both women .
Cohen told a federal judge that he made the payments `` in coordination with and at the direction of a candidate for federal office '' and that he did so `` for the principal purpose of influencing the election . ''
On Dec. 12 , 2018 , Cohen was sentenced to 36 months in prison . He had been facing as much as 63 months . Cohen was also ordered to pay nearly $ 2 million for his crimes .
Like Manafort , Rick Gates was once a top aide to Trump , serving as his deputy campaign chairman during the 2016 presidential race and then later as a senior aide on the presidential inaugural committee .
Gates agreed to cooperate with the Mueller investigation after pleading guilty in February 2018 to financial fraud and lying to federal investigators .
He was originally charged alongside Manafort with conspiracy to launder money , making false statements and other charges in connection with their work advising Russia-friendly politicians in Ukraine .
At Manafort 's trial , Gates testified that he and his former partner used offshore bank accounts and wire transfers to hide money from the IRS . Gates faces as much as six years in prison . He has continued cooperating with the government as its investigations continue and has not yet been sentenced .
Alex van der Zwaan became the first person to be sentenced in the Mueller probe after he pleaded guilty to lying to investigators .
The son-in-law of a Russia-based billionaire , van der Zwaan acknowledged in federal court in February 2018 that he had misled investigators about a conversation he had with Gates , the former Trump campaign aide , in September 2016 .
The conversation focused on a report that van der Zwaan 's law firm prepared about the prosecution of Yulia Tymoshenko , a political rival of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych .
He was sentenced to 30 days in prison and a $ 20,000 fine .
Richardo Pinedo is a California man who in February 2018 pleaded guilty to identity fraud .
Pinedo admitted to taking in tens of thousands of dollars by creating hundreds of bank accounts , often using stolen identities . He then sold those accounts on the Web to unidentified foreign users .
It 's unclear to what extent , if any , those users included suspects connected to the Russia investigation . But it 's possible they were used as part of a scheme described by Mueller 's office in which Russians intent on attacking the 2016 election moved money around the world to pay for virtual private networks , Web hosting services and other such cybertools .
In an interview with The New York Times , Pinedo 's attorney , Jeremy I. Lessem , said that if his client 's actions did assist `` any individuals , including foreign nationals , with interfering in the American presidential election , it was done completely without his knowledge or understanding . ''
Pinedo was sentenced to six months in prison , six months of home confinement and 100 hours of community service .
During the 2016 campaign , Michael Flynn led chants of `` lock her up '' at the Republican National Convention , and after Trump 's victory , he was appointed to serve as his first national security adviser .
But he lasted less than a month on the job before resigning , and in December 2017 , he pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador during the transition .
The single count against Flynn related to discussions with Ambassador Sergey Kislyak around two issues : Obama administration sanctions on Russia and a United Nations resolution condemning Israeli settlements .
According to court documents , Flynn denied to investigators that he asked Kislyak to either defeat or delay the U.N. vote on settlements and that he also asked the Russians to refrain from retaliating against the sanctions . The government said Flynn was directed by `` a very senior member '' of the transition team .
Flynn , a former Army general , would eventually admit to misleading the FBI about those conversations , and as part of his plea deal he agreed to cooperate with the special counsel 's investigation . Ahead of his sentencing hearing , prosecutors said Flynn had provided `` substantial '' aid with `` several ongoing investigations , '' telling a court his assistance merited a judge 's consideration .
George Papadopoulos was the first person charged in the Mueller investigation and pleaded guilty in October 2017 to lying to the FBI .
Papadopoulos was a junior foreign policy adviser to the Trump 2016 campaign — one of a number brought on early amid questions about who would advise Trump about foreign affairs . Trump once praised him as an `` excellent guy . ''
In January 2017 , the FBI questioned Papadopoulos about his interactions with a professor based in London who had links to the Russian government . The official told Papadopoulos that the Russians had `` dirt '' on Hillary Clinton in the form of `` thousands of emails , '' according to court documents .
Prosecutors say Papadopoulos went on to use the professor 's connections in an effort to arrange a meeting between the Trump campaign and Russian officials .
In his interview with the FBI , Papadopoulos originally described the professor as `` a nothing , '' but investigators said that , `` In truth ... Papadopoulos understood that the professor had substantial connections to Russian government officials . ''
Papadopoulos ' attorney said when he was sentenced that he did n't recall whether he had communicated the information about the dirt on Clinton to his superiors on the Trump campaign .
He was sentenced to 14 days in prison . In a statement provided to NPR after Papadopoulos ' release in December 2018 , his lawyer emphasized there was no evidence that he had colluded with Russia and that he has never been accused of doing so or of being involved in any plot to undermine the presidential election .
In July 2018 , the Justice Department brought charges against 12 Russian intelligence officers on a litany of alleged crimes related to Russia 's hacking of the Democratic National Committee , the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Clinton presidential campaign .
Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein , who announced the charges , said the defendants worked for the Russian government 's Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff — known by its Russian initials as the GRU .
In a 29-page indictment , the Justice Department outlined how the attackers were able to access and steal sensitive Democratic Party emails and information and then carefully timed their release for maximum political impact through fictitious online personas that included `` DCLeaks '' and `` Guccifer 2.0 . ''
The Russians also targeted state election systems and stole information related to approximately 500,000 voters . However , because Russia is unlikely to extradite the accused suspects , the case is unlikely to go to trial .
Konstantin Kilimnik worked alongside Manafort in Ukraine for more than a decade . He started as a translator and later helped run his lobbying operations in Kiev , according to Politico .
In June 2018 , the special counsel 's office charged Kilimnik with obstruction of justice for allegedly trying to persuade witnesses to lie to the jury in the government 's then-pending case against Manafort . Ultimately , Manafort pleaded guilty and the matter did not go to trial .
Kilimnik is believed to be living in Russia , meaning it is unlikely he will be extradited to the U.S. for trial .
A federal grand jury indicted 13 Russians and three Russian entities in February 2018 for what Rosenstein described to reporters as `` information warfare '' with `` the stated goal of spreading distrust towards the candidates and the political system in general . ''
At the center of the indictment was the work of the Internet Research Agency , the notorious Russian troll farm based in St. Petersburg . It was there , Rosenstein said , that the suspects `` took extraordinary steps to make it appear that they were ordinary American political activists . ''
They created `` hundreds of social media accounts '' to divide Americans around polarizing issues and , according to the indictment , `` engaged in operations primarily intended to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton ... and to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump . ''

Updated April 12, 2019, at 9:12 p.m. ET

After nearly two years of work, special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election has officially drawn to a close. Mueller has submitted his findings to Attorney General William Barr, marking the end of an investigation that has resulted in criminal charges against 34 individuals. To date, the special counsel has secured seven guilty pleas and one conviction at trial, but 25 Russians indicted by Mueller are unlikely to ever see a U.S. courtroom.

Among those ensnared by the probe have been the president's former personal attorney, officials from his 2016 campaign, former aides and advisers and members of Russian intelligence services. While the long-term political implications of the investigation remain far from certain, it has already generated new insights into how Russia targeted the 2016 election, the presidential transition and the Trump family's business empire.

Here's a closer look at who has been charged.

Indicted: Roger Stone

Enlarge this image toggle caption Mark Wilson/Getty Images Mark Wilson/Getty Images

Roger Stone, a longtime informal adviser to President Trump and self-proclaimed ""dirty trickster,"" was arrested by FBI agents at his home in Florida and charged with seven counts, including obstruction, witness tampering and making false statements in relation to Russian interference in the 2016 election.

The special counsel's indictment alleges that Stone was in regular contact with WikiLeaks (identified in the indictment as ""Organization 1"") and the Trump campaign at key moments as stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign were being released to the public ahead of Election Day in 2016. The timing of these communications, prosecutors allege, suggests officials in the Trump campaign knew ahead of time that WikiLeaks had stolen the emails and was prepared to leak them.

According to the indictment:

""After the July 22, 2016 release of stolen DNC emails by Organization 1, a senior Trump Campaign official was directed to contact Stone about any additional releases and what other damaging information Organization 1 had regarding the Clinton Campaign.""

The indictment says Stone ""thereafter told the Trump Campaign about potential future releases.""

As NPR's Philip Ewing and Tamara Keith note, the indictment was the first to charge an American in relation to the theft and release of stolen Democratic Party emails. Moreover, ""it shows Mueller wants to try to prove that at least one person in the Trump campaign's orbit colluded with Russian's election interference.""

Stone, who pleaded not guilty, has repeatedly denied that he played any role in helping the Russian attack on the 2016 election. In May, he told NPR that the special counsel was ""following a fake news narrative, which continues to repeat incorrectly that I had advance knowledge of the content source or exact timing of the WikiLeaks disclosures.""

Convicted: Paul Manafort

Enlarge this image toggle caption Keith Lane/Getty Images Keith Lane/Getty Images

President Trump's former campaign chairman pleaded guilty in September 2018 to conspiracy against the United States and conspiracy to obstruct justice — charges that stemmed from a range of alleged crimes committed over more than a decade as a lobbyist and, later, a member of the Trump campaign.

In pleading guilty, Manafort agreed to cooperate with the Mueller investigation. Less than three months later, though, the special counsel's office told a federal judge in Washington, D.C., that he had ""breached the plea agreement.""

Manafort's attorneys insist he gave the government useful information, but prosecutors said Manafort committed new crimes ""by lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Special Counsel's Office on a variety of subject matters.""

U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson ruled that Manafort had intentionally lied to the special counsel's office, which meant Mueller's team was no longer bound by the plea agreement.

At sentencing, Jackson ordered Manafort to serve 43 months in federal prison on top of the 47 months he was sentenced to serve in a separate case brought by the special counsel in Virginia. In all, he will serve just under 7 1/2 years.

In the Virginia case — the first to reach trial for the Mueller investigation — prosecutors accused Manafort of failing to pay taxes on millions of dollars that he earned as a consultant for pro-Russia politicians in Ukraine and kept hidden from the IRS.

The jury found Manafort guilty of eight counts in the sprawling tax and bank fraud case but deadlocked on 10 others, prompting U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III to declare a mistrial on those charges.

Manafort had been facing as much as 24 years in prison, but Ellis told the court that such a penalty would have been ""excessive,"" adding that Manafort had lived ""an otherwise blameless life.""

In her sentencing decision, Jackson broke from that assessment. ""It is hard to overstate the number of lies and the amount of fraud involved,"" she said of Manafort's case. ""A significant portion of his career has been spent gaming the system,"" she also said.

Pleaded guilty: Michael Cohen

At one time, lawyer Michael Cohen said he would ""take a bullet"" for Donald Trump. But by pleading guilty in November 2018 to lying to Congress, Cohen raised new questions about Trump's business interests in Russia during a pivotal period of the 2016 presidential campaign.

Cohen admitted that he lied when he told Congress that discussions about a potential Trump Tower project in Moscow ended in January 2016. Actually, he said, they continued through June of that year.

According to court documents, Cohen also initially said that his overtures to the Russian government went unrequited, but as talks progressed, he eventually heard back from a top aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin: Dmitry Peskov.

Cohen also pleaded guilty in August 2018 to five counts of tax evasion, one count of falsifying submissions to a bank and two campaign finance violations — a plea that directly implicated the president.

The campaign finance violations stem from two payments that Cohen helped arrange ahead of Election Day 2016 to buy the silence of former Playboy model Karen McDougal and adult film actress Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels. The women say they had sexual relationships with Trump.

Trump has acknowledged that he reimbursed Cohen for a $130,000 payment to Clifford — but denies the alleged relationships with both women.

Cohen told a federal judge that he made the payments ""in coordination with and at the direction of a candidate for federal office"" and that he did so ""for the principal purpose of influencing the election.""

On Dec. 12, 2018, Cohen was sentenced to 36 months in prison. He had been facing as much as 63 months. Cohen was also ordered to pay nearly $2 million for his crimes.

Pleaded guilty: Rick Gates

Like Manafort, Rick Gates was once a top aide to Trump, serving as his deputy campaign chairman during the 2016 presidential race and then later as a senior aide on the presidential inaugural committee.

Before that, Gates spent years as Manafort's protégé.

Gates agreed to cooperate with the Mueller investigation after pleading guilty in February 2018 to financial fraud and lying to federal investigators.

He was originally charged alongside Manafort with conspiracy to launder money, making false statements and other charges in connection with their work advising Russia-friendly politicians in Ukraine.

At Manafort's trial, Gates testified that he and his former partner used offshore bank accounts and wire transfers to hide money from the IRS. Gates faces as much as six years in prison. He has continued cooperating with the government as its investigations continue and has not yet been sentenced.

Pleaded guilty: Alex van der Zwaan

Alex van der Zwaan became the first person to be sentenced in the Mueller probe after he pleaded guilty to lying to investigators.

The son-in-law of a Russia-based billionaire, van der Zwaan acknowledged in federal court in February 2018 that he had misled investigators about a conversation he had with Gates, the former Trump campaign aide, in September 2016.

The conversation focused on a report that van der Zwaan's law firm prepared about the prosecution of Yulia Tymoshenko, a political rival of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych.

He was sentenced to 30 days in prison and a $20,000 fine.

Read the statement of the offense.

Pleaded guilty: Richard Pinedo

Richardo Pinedo is a California man who in February 2018 pleaded guilty to identity fraud.

Pinedo admitted to taking in tens of thousands of dollars by creating hundreds of bank accounts, often using stolen identities. He then sold those accounts on the Web to unidentified foreign users.

It's unclear to what extent, if any, those users included suspects connected to the Russia investigation. But it's possible they were used as part of a scheme described by Mueller's office in which Russians intent on attacking the 2016 election moved money around the world to pay for virtual private networks, Web hosting services and other such cybertools.

In an interview with The New York Times, Pinedo's attorney, Jeremy I. Lessem, said that if his client's actions did assist ""any individuals, including foreign nationals, with interfering in the American presidential election, it was done completely without his knowledge or understanding.""

Pinedo was sentenced to six months in prison, six months of home confinement and 100 hours of community service.

Pleaded guilty: Michael Flynn

During the 2016 campaign, Michael Flynn led chants of ""lock her up"" at the Republican National Convention, and after Trump's victory, he was appointed to serve as his first national security adviser.

But he lasted less than a month on the job before resigning, and in December 2017, he pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador during the transition.

The single count against Flynn related to discussions with Ambassador Sergey Kislyak around two issues: Obama administration sanctions on Russia and a United Nations resolution condemning Israeli settlements.

According to court documents, Flynn denied to investigators that he asked Kislyak to either defeat or delay the U.N. vote on settlements and that he also asked the Russians to refrain from retaliating against the sanctions. The government said Flynn was directed by ""a very senior member"" of the transition team.

Flynn, a former Army general, would eventually admit to misleading the FBI about those conversations, and as part of his plea deal he agreed to cooperate with the special counsel's investigation. Ahead of his sentencing hearing, prosecutors said Flynn had provided ""substantial"" aid with ""several ongoing investigations,"" telling a court his assistance merited a judge's consideration.

Pleaded guilty: George Papadopoulos

Enlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images

George Papadopoulos was the first person charged in the Mueller investigation and pleaded guilty in October 2017 to lying to the FBI.

Papadopoulos was a junior foreign policy adviser to the Trump 2016 campaign — one of a number brought on early amid questions about who would advise Trump about foreign affairs. Trump once praised him as an ""excellent guy.""

In January 2017, the FBI questioned Papadopoulos about his interactions with a professor based in London who had links to the Russian government. The official told Papadopoulos that the Russians had ""dirt"" on Hillary Clinton in the form of ""thousands of emails,"" according to court documents.

Prosecutors say Papadopoulos went on to use the professor's connections in an effort to arrange a meeting between the Trump campaign and Russian officials.

In his interview with the FBI, Papadopoulos originally described the professor as ""a nothing,"" but investigators said that, ""In truth ... Papadopoulos understood that the professor had substantial connections to Russian government officials.""

Papadopoulos' attorney said when he was sentenced that he didn't recall whether he had communicated the information about the dirt on Clinton to his superiors on the Trump campaign.

He was sentenced to 14 days in prison. In a statement provided to NPR after Papadopoulos' release in December 2018, his lawyer emphasized there was no evidence that he had colluded with Russia and that he has never been accused of doing so or of being involved in any plot to undermine the presidential election.

Indicted: Russian intelligence

In July 2018, the Justice Department brought charges against 12 Russian intelligence officers on a litany of alleged crimes related to Russia's hacking of the Democratic National Committee, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Clinton presidential campaign.

Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who announced the charges, said the defendants worked for the Russian government's Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff — known by its Russian initials as the GRU.

In a 29-page indictment, the Justice Department outlined how the attackers were able to access and steal sensitive Democratic Party emails and information and then carefully timed their release for maximum political impact through fictitious online personas that included ""DCLeaks"" and ""Guccifer 2.0.""

The Russians also targeted state election systems and stole information related to approximately 500,000 voters. However, because Russia is unlikely to extradite the accused suspects, the case is unlikely to go to trial.

Indicted: Konstantin Kilimnik

Konstantin Kilimnik worked alongside Manafort in Ukraine for more than a decade. He started as a translator and later helped run his lobbying operations in Kiev, according to Politico.

In June 2018, the special counsel's office charged Kilimnik with obstruction of justice for allegedly trying to persuade witnesses to lie to the jury in the government's then-pending case against Manafort. Ultimately, Manafort pleaded guilty and the matter did not go to trial.

Kilimnik is believed to be living in Russia, meaning it is unlikely he will be extradited to the U.S. for trial.

Indicted: Russian Internet trolls

A federal grand jury indicted 13 Russians and three Russian entities in February 2018 for what Rosenstein described to reporters as ""information warfare"" with ""the stated goal of spreading distrust towards the candidates and the political system in general.""

At the center of the indictment was the work of the Internet Research Agency, the notorious Russian troll farm based in St. Petersburg. It was there, Rosenstein said, that the suspects ""took extraordinary steps to make it appear that they were ordinary American political activists.""

They created ""hundreds of social media accounts"" to divide Americans around polarizing issues and, according to the indictment, ""engaged in operations primarily intended to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton ... and to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump.""

The indictment doesn't assess whether the disinformation scheme succeeded in swaying votes, and the U.S. intelligence community also says it hasn't assessed what kind of effect the scheme had on the outcome of the 2016 White House race. Barring Russia's cooperation in extraditing the accused disinformation specialists, they are unlikely to face trial.

Pleaded guilty: W. Samuel Patten

Greg Craig, a former White House counsel during the Obama administration, was charged with making false statements to and concealing information from federal officials in connection with his work for influential clients in the Ukraine.

Indicted: Julian Assange

As with the indictments against Greg Craig and Samuel Patten, the case against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange wasn't brought by the Mueller team. Rather, Assange was charged by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia.

His arrest had been rumored for months. And even though the Justice Department has outlined the role played by Assange and WikiLeaks in the Russian attack on the 2016 election, the case against him centered on an alleged conspiracy to assist Chelsea Manning in the theft of classified intelligence and government communications.

Mccarthy, John Mccormack, Michael Brendan Dougherty, Mairead Mcardle, Robert Verbruggen, Carrie Severino, Tobias Hoonhout, Rich Lowry, John Fund","Donald Trump waves as he walks out from the White House in Washington , DC ( Reuters : Yuri Gripas )
Up until now , veiled orders have not been thought the equivalent of obstruction .
On April 10 , 2016 , President Obama publicly stated that Hillary Clinton had shown “ carelessness ” in using a private e-mail server to handle classified information , but he insisted that she had not intended to endanger national security ( which is not an element of the relevant criminal statute ) . The president acknowledged that classified information had been transmitted via Secretary Clinton ’ s server , but he suggested that , in the greater scheme of things , its importance had been vastly overstated .
On July 5 , 2016 , FBI director James Comey publicly stated that Clinton had been “ extremely careless ” in using a private email server to handle classified information , but he insisted that she had not intended to endanger national security ( which is not an element of the relevant criminal statute ) . The director acknowledged that classified information had been transmitted via Secretary Clinton ’ s server , but he suggested that , in the greater scheme of things , it was just a small percentage of the emails involved .
Could there be more striking parallels ? A cynic might say that Obama had clearly signaled to the FBI and the Justice Department that he did not want Mrs. Clinton to be charged with a crime , and that , with this not-so-subtle pressure in the air , the president ’ s subordinates dropped the case — exactly what Obama wanted , relying precisely on Obama ’ s stated rationale .
Of course , they ’ re not yawning now . Now it is Donald Trump , not Barack Obama , sending Comey signals . So now , such signals are a major issue — not merely of obstruction of justice , but of high crimes and misdemeanors .
Trump hysteria seems to be a permanent condition , a combustive compound of media-Democrat derangement surrounding a president who keeps providing derangement material . Let ’ s try to keep our feet on the ground , but with a commitment to get the evidence and go wherever it takes us .
For now , we don ’ t have much evidence . Essentially , we ’ ve got single statement , mined by the New York Times from a memo that no one outside a tight circle inside the FBI has seen — indeed , that the Times has not seen . According to anonymous sources , the memo was written by then–FBI director Comey shortly after a private meeting with President Trump — only two of them in the room after Trump asked other officials to leave . This was on February 14 , the day after National Security Adviser Michael Flynn resigned over inaccurate statements he made to senior administration officials in recounting conversations he ’ d had with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak .
Trump is said to have told Comey , “ I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go , to letting Flynn go . He is a good guy . I hope you can let this go . ”
Other than telling us that Comey replied , “ I agree he is a good guy , ” the Times provides no context of the conversation . Its report gives no indication of whether the memo provides such context .
On its face , the statement does not amount to obstruction of justice . Trump could be said to be putting pressure on his subordinate , just as Obama was putting pressure on his subordinates ( Comey included ) last April . But assuming the Times is right about the memo , Trump did not order Comey to drop the case . In fact , Trump ’ s statement is consistent with encouraging Comey to use his own judgment , with the understanding that Trump hoped Comey would come out favorably to Flynn .
But of course , also with the understanding that if Comey pushed to prosecute Flynn , the president — who had the power to fire Comey — was going to be very unhappy . Just as President Obama would have been very unhappy , and in a position to fire Comey , if Mrs. Clinton had been indicted .
It is not frivolous to infer that Trump ’ s statement to Comey was a veiled order . If that is your interpretation , though , you can not avoid the conclusion that Obama ’ s public statements were also veiled orders not to indict Clinton . Up until now , veiled orders have not been thought the equivalent of obstruction of justice .
In light of what I ’ ve previously contended ( viz. , that obstruction of justice is a concept irrelevant to a counterintelligence investigation ) , I must note here that concerns about obstruction of justice in the context of the reported Trump-Comey conversation are legitimate . That is because the conversation does not directly relate to the so-called Russia investigation , which Comey has explained is a counterintelligence inquiry regarding Kremlin interference in the 2016 election . Rather , Trump and Comey were speaking about a criminal investigation of Flynn , ancillary to but separate from the Russia investigation . We are informed that a grand jury in Virginia is considering evidence of transactions involving Flynn , although it is not clear that this was the case on February 14 , when Trump and Comey spoke .
There is good reason to believe that veiled orders , while inappropriate , are not criminal — i.e. , they do not rise to the level of prosecutable obstruction of justice . Obstruction can be a tough crime to prove . It is necessary to establish , beyond a reasonable doubt , that the suspect acted corruptly in impeding or influencing a criminal investigation . That means acting with knowledge that one ’ s conduct was unlawful , and with a specific intent to undermine the truth-seeking function .

Up until now, veiled orders have not been thought the equivalent of obstruction.

On April 10, 2016, President Obama publicly stated that Hillary Clinton had shown “carelessness” in using a private e-mail server to handle classified information, but he insisted that she had not intended to endanger national security (which is not an element of the relevant criminal statute). The president acknowledged that classified information had been transmitted via Secretary Clinton’s server, but he suggested that, in the greater scheme of things, its importance had been vastly overstated.

On July 5, 2016, FBI director James Comey publicly stated that Clinton had been “extremely careless” in using a private email server to handle classified information, but he insisted that she had not intended to endanger national security (which is not an element of the relevant criminal statute). The director acknowledged that classified information had been transmitted via Secretary Clinton’s server, but he suggested that, in the greater scheme of things, it was just a small percentage of the emails involved.

Case dismissed.

Could there be more striking parallels? A cynic might say that Obama had clearly signaled to the FBI and the Justice Department that he did not want Mrs. Clinton to be charged with a crime, and that, with this not-so-subtle pressure in the air, the president’s subordinates dropped the case — exactly what Obama wanted, relying precisely on Obama’s stated rationale.

Yet the media yawned.

Of course, they’re not yawning now. Now it is Donald Trump, not Barack Obama, sending Comey signals. So now, such signals are a major issue — not merely of obstruction of justice, but of high crimes and misdemeanors.

Trump hysteria seems to be a permanent condition, a combustive compound of media-Democrat derangement surrounding a president who keeps providing derangement material. Let’s try to keep our feet on the ground, but with a commitment to get the evidence and go wherever it takes us.

For now, we don’t have much evidence. Essentially, we’ve got single statement, mined by the New York Times from a memo that no one outside a tight circle inside the FBI has seen — indeed, that the Times has not seen. According to anonymous sources, the memo was written by then–FBI director Comey shortly after a private meeting with President Trump — only two of them in the room after Trump asked other officials to leave. This was on February 14, the day after National Security Adviser Michael Flynn resigned over inaccurate statements he made to senior administration officials in recounting conversations he’d had with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak.

Trump is said to have told Comey, “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.”

Other than telling us that Comey replied, “I agree he is a good guy,” the Times provides no context of the conversation. Its report gives no indication of whether the memo provides such context.

On its face, the statement does not amount to obstruction of justice. Trump could be said to be putting pressure on his subordinate, just as Obama was putting pressure on his subordinates (Comey included) last April. But assuming the Times is right about the memo, Trump did not order Comey to drop the case. In fact, Trump’s statement is consistent with encouraging Comey to use his own judgment, with the understanding that Trump hoped Comey would come out favorably to Flynn.

But of course, also with the understanding that if Comey pushed to prosecute Flynn, the president — who had the power to fire Comey — was going to be very unhappy. Just as President Obama would have been very unhappy, and in a position to fire Comey, if Mrs. Clinton had been indicted.

It is not frivolous to infer that Trump’s statement to Comey was a veiled order. If that is your interpretation, though, you cannot avoid the conclusion that Obama’s public statements were also veiled orders not to indict Clinton. Up until now, veiled orders have not been thought the equivalent of obstruction of justice.

Context is critical, and we don’t have it.

In light of what I’ve previously contended (viz., that obstruction of justice is a concept irrelevant to a counterintelligence investigation), I must note here that concerns about obstruction of justice in the context of the reported Trump-Comey conversation are legitimate. That is because the conversation does not directly relate to the so-called Russia investigation, which Comey has explained is a counterintelligence inquiry regarding Kremlin interference in the 2016 election. Rather, Trump and Comey were speaking about a criminal investigation of Flynn, ancillary to but separate from the Russia investigation. We are informed that a grand jury in Virginia is considering evidence of transactions involving Flynn, although it is not clear that this was the case on February 14, when Trump and Comey spoke.

There is good reason to believe that veiled orders, while inappropriate, are not criminal — i.e., they do not rise to the level of prosecutable obstruction of justice. Obstruction can be a tough crime to prove. It is necessary to establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the suspect acted corruptly in impeding or influencing a criminal investigation. That means acting with knowledge that one’s conduct was unlawful, and with a specific intent to undermine the truth-seeking function.

Context is critical, and we don’t have it. All we know is that Trump hoped the criminal investigation would be dropped — but again, did not order it to be dropped — and vouched for Flynn’s character. That may have been inappropriate under the circumstances, but it was not corrupt. Comey surely found it awkward, but he clearly did not perceive it as obstruction. The former director is a highly experienced and meritoriously decorated former prosecutor and investigator. He knows what obstruction of justice is. And the Jim Comey I’ve known for 30 years would not stand for political interference in law enforcement. If he had understood Trump’s remarks as a directive or, worse, a threat, he would have resigned.

It is not enough to say that he did not resign. Unlike the investigation of Mrs. Clinton, the investigation of Flynn has continued. Plus, Comey does not appear to have indicated to his subordinates, to his Justice Department superiors, or to Congress that he felt threatened. Deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein and Comey’s former deputy (now acting director) Andrew McCabe have not intimated, even vaguely, that their investigative activities have been hampered. Again, the investigation is proceeding apace.

There is no question that obstruction of justice is an impeachable offense. But media hyperventilating notwithstanding, the basis for claiming at this point that President Trump obstructed justice is not there . . . unless you also think President Obama obstructed justice last April.

It looks like Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will stay in his post until at least Thursday , when he ’ s set to meet with President Donald Trump .
Monday was a wild day in Washington , as different news reports gave rise to speculation that Rosenstein had resigned or even been fired . It started when Axios reported on Monday morning that Rosenstein offered to resign in a conversation with White House Chief of Staff John Kelly . Others , like the Washington Post and CNN , reported the same .

Statement on Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein : pic.twitter.com/yBgAydv9oR — Sarah Sanders ( @ PressSec ) September 24 , 2018
The conflicting news comes three days after the New York Times reported that the deputy attorney general said he wanted to record conversations with Trump last year and discussed using the 25th Amendment to remove the president from office . Rosenstein denied the report , and one source told the Times that Rosenstein had merely been joking .
But if Rosenstein were on the way out , it would be highly significant news .
Rosenstein is the man responsible for overseeing Mueller ’ s investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government during the 2016 US presidential election . That ’ s because Attorney General Jeff Sessions , Rosenstein ’ s boss , recused himself from the probe after it became clear he ’ d provided false and misleading testimony to Congress about his own contacts with Russia .
Rosenstein has therefore spent more than a year walking a delicate tightrope .
On one hand , he ’ s committed to protecting the investigation from conservatives inside and outside Congress who believed it ’ s biased against the president and had urged Trump to fire the special counsel . But Rosenstein couldn ’ t champion the investigation too much or he ’ d draw Trump ’ s ire .
Rosenstein ’ s possible departure would strike at the heart of the Trump-Russia investigation because Mueller has to run major investigative decisions past the deputy attorney general . Solicitor General Noel Francisco , who would replace Rosenstein if he left , could simply refuse to approve Mueller ’ s requests . That would slow the whole investigation to a crawl — or lead to Mueller ’ s ouster if he felt there was a reason to do so .
Rosenstein had refused to do that . He instead allowed Mueller ’ s probe to proceed unimpeded , while Mueller indicted top members of Trump ’ s campaign , including former campaign chair Paul Manafort , on tax , financial , and bank fraud charges . Manafort later pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy against the US and one count of conspiracy to obstruct justice and is now cooperating with the Mueller investigation .
The future of the Mueller probe , and possibly even Trump ’ s presidency , depends on how well Rosenstein performed his delicate balancing act .
Rosenstein has to keep Trump and the Justice Department happy . That ’ s not easy .
Rosenstein ’ s performance during a congressional hearing last December showed how he has had to navigate the difficult situation he ’ s in .
Here ’ s what happened : On the night of December 12 , mere hours before Rosenstein would testify at a House Judiciary Committee hearing , the Justice Department showed reporters some anti-Trump texts . The messages were from two FBI officials , Peter Strzok and Lisa Page , who had corresponded throughout the 2016 presidential election .
Strzok , a former top FBI counterintelligence official who was on Mueller ’ s investigative team , texted Page that Trump was an “ idiot. ” He also wanted Clinton to defeat Trump in the election — in another message , he wrote : `` God Hillary should win 100,000,000 — 0 . ”
There was also a text that seemingly implied Strzok and Page were working on an “ insurance policy ” in case Trump won the election . But the Wall Street Journal reported on December 18 that Strzok ’ s text was really about the need to investigate possible Trump-Russia ties . Mueller removed Strzok from his staff last July , and the Strzok-Page exchanges remain subject to an internal investigation by the Justice Department . Still , some conservatives in and out of government think these texts show that the Mueller probe was working against the president .
It ’ s unclear if Rosenstein authorized the release of the texts , but some legal analysts thought the DOJ made the messages public the night before Rosenstein ’ s big hearing to curry favor with the anti-Mueller crowd on the House Judiciary Committee .
`` It 's appalling behavior by the department , '' Matthew Miller , a spokesperson for the Justice Department in the Obama administration , told Business Insider about the release of the texts at the time . `` This is an ongoing investigation in which these employees have due-process rights , and the political leadership at DOJ has thrown them to the wolves so Rosenstein can get credit from House Republicans at his hearing . ''
Rosenstein defended the release of the texts during the hearing , saying , `` We consulted with the inspector general to determine that he had no objection to releasing the material , ” in response to a question about the texts by Rep. Jamie Raskin ( D-MD ) . “ If he had , we would not have released it , ” Rosenstein said .
But he also defended Mueller in that same session . Rep. Jerrold Nadler ( D-NY ) , the committee ’ s ranking member , asked Rosenstein the most highly anticipated question of the session : “ If you were ordered today to fire Mr. Mueller , what would you do ? ”
“ If there were good cause , I would act . If there were no good cause , I would not , ” Rosenstein replied . He then went on to defend Mueller personally , saying , “ It would 've been difficult to find anyone more qualified for this job . ”
These exchanges show that Rosenstein was trying to stand up for the probe while still appeasing Trump and his allies . Benjamin Wittes , an expert on national security law at the Brookings Institution , wrote on the Lawfare blog that Rosenstein may pay a price for doing both .
“ Rosenstein here has , at a minimum , contributed to [ the political ] circus — at the expense of his own employees , ” he wrote after the hearing . “ The DOJ and FBI workforces will not forget that . Nor should they . ”
Those 24 hours encapsulated Rosenstein ’ s political two-step . One minute he defended the release of texts that served as ammunition for Mueller critics and Trump allies to lambast the investigation ; the next , he shielded Mueller from criticism by those same anti-Mueller conservatives and Trump allies — and put his own job at risk .
Keeping both sides happy allowed Rosenstein to say he supported his staff while also backing Trump . The deputy attorney general played a deft game , and those who had previously worked with him felt he could pull it off .
“ What you have in Rod is somebody that is battle-tested , ” Julie Myers Wood , a prosecutor and former colleague of Rosenstein ’ s , told me in an interview last December , months before Rosenstein ’ s ouster . “ I can ’ t think of anyone that is more prepared to handle this situation than him . ”
On May 1 , Rosenstein told a crowd that “ the Department of Justice is not going to be extorted. ” He continued : “ We ’ re going to do what ’ s required by the rule of law , and any kind of threats that anybody makes are not going to affect the way we do our job . ”
Rosenstein is in the middle of a major political controversy
Rosenstein has long been considered an apolitical straight shooter by those who worked with him . “ He has a directness about him — there ’ s no bullshit , ” Philip Heymann , Rosenstein ’ s former professor at Harvard Law School and later his colleague , told me before Trump reportedly let Rosenstein go . “ He says what he thinks , but he ’ s always fair . ”
President George W. Bush appointed Rosenstein as the US attorney for Maryland in 2005 . President Barack Obama kept him on , making Rosenstein only one of three US attorneys — out of a total of 93 — retained by the new administration . Rosenstein officially joined the Trump administration last April as deputy attorney general after receiving broad bipartisan support in his confirmation vote .
But Rosenstein finds himself in the middle of a major political controversy just two weeks into his new job . On May 9 , 2017 , he co-authored a letter with Sessions making the case that Trump should fire then-FBI Director James Comey because of how Comey had handled the results of the agency ’ s Clinton investigation .
“ Over the past year , ” Rosenstein wrote , “ the FBI ’ s reputation and credibility have suffered substantial damage , and it has affected the entire Department of Justice . ”
He added : “ I can not defend the director ’ s handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton ’ s emails , and I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken . ”
Trump fired Comey later that day , citing the Sessions-Rosenstein letter as his reason . Pro-Trump Republicans and conservative media applauded the decision to remove Comey , but Democrats were furious . And some of that fury extended to Rosenstein .
Sen. Mark Warner ( D-VA ) told NPR shortly after the Comey firing that he had “ lost any confidence I might have had ” in Rosenstein , whose “ first official action was putting his name on that letter , basically making what appeared to be bogus reasons [ for ] firing the FBI director . ”
Those who know Rosenstein say he recommended firing Comey not because he wanted to please Trump , but rather because he believed Comey hurt the FBI ’ s reputation . “ He ’ s guided by justice , not by politics , ” Steve Levin , a former colleague of Rosenstein ’ s in Maryland , told me in an interview before the firing .
A week later , Rosenstein named Mueller as the special counsel , authorizing him to look into possible Trump-Russia ties as well as “ any matters that arose or may arise from the investigation . ”
It seems quite clear that Rosenstein isn ’ t in Trump ’ s pocket . But Trump himself wondered aloud where Rosenstein ’ s true loyalties lay , tweeting on June 16 , “ I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director ! Witch Hunt . ”
Rosenstein didn ’ t stop Mueller from pursuing the investigation the way he saw fit , and he made every indication that he intended to continue letting Mueller proceed with his investigation .
But if Rosenstein is fired or resigns , Francisco could change all that , especially if Trump applies significant pressure . That said , if Francisco did fire Mueller , the investigation might not be completely undermined , as five Trump associates have pleaded guilty and prosecutors are likely to continue to follow leads from the beginning of the investigation in June 2016 .
And the future is still very unclear . If Francisco doesn ’ t do Trump ’ s bidding , the president could simply fire him . That ’ s possibly more detrimental to the Mueller probe .
Asha Rangappa , a legal expert at Yale 's Jackson Institute for Global Affairs , wrote in a post for the Just Security blog last December that a new deputy attorney general could effectively cripple the Mueller investigation by rejecting Mueller ’ s requests to investigate more people , obtain new evidence , or pursue charges against additional people , for instance .
In effect , Rosenstein ’ s possible ouster now has put the Mueller probe in its most precarious position to date — possibly allowing Trump to escape further investigation into him , his associates , and his family .","Correction and update: A previous version of this article said Rosenstein was out, citing reports from other news outlets.

The conflicting news comes three days after the New York Times reported that the deputy attorney general said he wanted to record conversations with Trump last year and discussed using the 25th Amendment to remove the president from office. Rosenstein denied the report, and one source told the Times that Rosenstein had merely been joking.

But if Rosenstein were on the way out, it would be highly significant news.

Rosenstein is the man responsible for overseeing Mueller’s investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government during the 2016 US presidential election. That’s because Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Rosenstein’s boss, recused himself from the probe after it became clear he’d provided false and misleading testimony to Congress about his own contacts with Russia.

Rosenstein has therefore spent more than a year walking a delicate tightrope.

On one hand, he’s committed to protecting the investigation from conservatives inside and outside Congress who believed it’s biased against the president and had urged Trump to fire the special counsel. But Rosenstein couldn’t champion the investigation too much or he’d draw Trump’s ire.

Rosenstein’s possible departure would strike at the heart of the Trump-Russia investigation because Mueller has to run major investigative decisions past the deputy attorney general. Solicitor General Noel Francisco, who would replace Rosenstein if he left, could simply refuse to approve Mueller’s requests. That would slow the whole investigation to a crawl — or lead to Mueller’s ouster if he felt there was a reason to do so.

Rosenstein had refused to do that. He instead allowed Mueller’s probe to proceed unimpeded, while Mueller indicted top members of Trump’s campaign, including former campaign chair Paul Manafort, on tax, financial, and bank fraud charges. Manafort later pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy against the US and one count of conspiracy to obstruct justice and is now cooperating with the Mueller investigation.

The future of the Mueller probe, and possibly even Trump’s presidency, depends on how well Rosenstein performed his delicate balancing act.

Rosenstein has to keep Trump and the Justice Department happy. That’s not easy.

Rosenstein’s performance during a congressional hearing last December showed how he has had to navigate the difficult situation he’s in.

Here’s what happened: On the night of December 12, mere hours before Rosenstein would testify at a House Judiciary Committee hearing, the Justice Department showed reporters some anti-Trump texts. The messages were from two FBI officials, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, who had corresponded throughout the 2016 presidential election.

Strzok, a former top FBI counterintelligence official who was on Mueller’s investigative team, texted Page that Trump was an “idiot.” He also wanted Clinton to defeat Trump in the election — in another message, he wrote: ""God Hillary should win 100,000,000 — 0.”

There was also a text that seemingly implied Strzok and Page were working on an “insurance policy” in case Trump won the election. But the Wall Street Journal reported on December 18 that Strzok’s text was really about the need to investigate possible Trump-Russia ties. Mueller removed Strzok from his staff last July, and the Strzok-Page exchanges remain subject to an internal investigation by the Justice Department. Still, some conservatives in and out of government think these texts show that the Mueller probe was working against the president.

It’s unclear if Rosenstein authorized the release of the texts, but some legal analysts thought the DOJ made the messages public the night before Rosenstein’s big hearing to curry favor with the anti-Mueller crowd on the House Judiciary Committee.

""It's appalling behavior by the department,"" Matthew Miller, a spokesperson for the Justice Department in the Obama administration, told Business Insider about the release of the texts at the time. ""This is an ongoing investigation in which these employees have due-process rights, and the political leadership at DOJ has thrown them to the wolves so Rosenstein can get credit from House Republicans at his hearing.""

Rosenstein defended the release of the texts during the hearing, saying, ""We consulted with the inspector general to determine that he had no objection to releasing the material,” in response to a question about the texts by Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD). “If he had, we would not have released it,” Rosenstein said.

But he also defended Mueller in that same session. Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), the committee’s ranking member, asked Rosenstein the most highly anticipated question of the session: “If you were ordered today to fire Mr. Mueller, what would you do?”

“If there were good cause, I would act. If there were no good cause, I would not,” Rosenstein replied. He then went on to defend Mueller personally, saying, “It would've been difficult to find anyone more qualified for this job.”

These exchanges show that Rosenstein was trying to stand up for the probe while still appeasing Trump and his allies. Benjamin Wittes, an expert on national security law at the Brookings Institution, wrote on the Lawfare blog that Rosenstein may pay a price for doing both.

“Rosenstein here has, at a minimum, contributed to [the political] circus — at the expense of his own employees,” he wrote after the hearing. “The DOJ and FBI workforces will not forget that. Nor should they.”

Those 24 hours encapsulated Rosenstein’s political two-step. One minute he defended the release of texts that served as ammunition for Mueller critics and Trump allies to lambast the investigation; the next, he shielded Mueller from criticism by those same anti-Mueller conservatives and Trump allies — and put his own job at risk.

Keeping both sides happy allowed Rosenstein to say he supported his staff while also backing Trump. The deputy attorney general played a deft game, and those who had previously worked with him felt he could pull it off.

“What you have in Rod is somebody that is battle-tested,” Julie Myers Wood, a prosecutor and former colleague of Rosenstein’s, told me in an interview last December, months before Rosenstein’s ouster. “I can’t think of anyone that is more prepared to handle this situation than him.”

On May 1, Rosenstein told a crowd that “the Department of Justice is not going to be extorted.” He continued: “We’re going to do what’s required by the rule of law, and any kind of threats that anybody makes are not going to affect the way we do our job.”

Rosenstein is in the middle of a major political controversy

Rosenstein has long been considered an apolitical straight shooter by those who worked with him. “He has a directness about him — there’s no bullshit,” Philip Heymann, Rosenstein’s former professor at Harvard Law School and later his colleague, told me before Trump reportedly let Rosenstein go. “He says what he thinks, but he’s always fair.”

President George W. Bush appointed Rosenstein as the US attorney for Maryland in 2005. President Barack Obama kept him on, making Rosenstein only one of three US attorneys — out of a total of 93 — retained by the new administration. Rosenstein officially joined the Trump administration last April as deputy attorney general after receiving broad bipartisan support in his confirmation vote.

But Rosenstein finds himself in the middle of a major political controversy just two weeks into his new job. On May 9, 2017, he co-authored a letter with Sessions making the case that Trump should fire then-FBI Director James Comey because of how Comey had handled the results of the agency’s Clinton investigation.

“Over the past year,” Rosenstein wrote, “the FBI’s reputation and credibility have suffered substantial damage, and it has affected the entire Department of Justice.”

He added: “I cannot defend the director’s handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton’s emails, and I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken.”

Trump fired Comey later that day, citing the Sessions-Rosenstein letter as his reason. Pro-Trump Republicans and conservative media applauded the decision to remove Comey, but Democrats were furious. And some of that fury extended to Rosenstein.

Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) told NPR shortly after the Comey firing that he had “lost any confidence I might have had” in Rosenstein, whose “first official action was putting his name on that letter, basically making what appeared to be bogus reasons [for] firing the FBI director.”

Those who know Rosenstein say he recommended firing Comey not because he wanted to please Trump, but rather because he believed Comey hurt the FBI’s reputation. “He’s guided by justice, not by politics,” Steve Levin, a former colleague of Rosenstein’s in Maryland, told me in an interview before the firing.

A week later, Rosenstein named Mueller as the special counsel, authorizing him to look into possible Trump-Russia ties as well as “any matters that arose or may arise from the investigation.”

It seems quite clear that Rosenstein isn’t in Trump’s pocket. But Trump himself wondered aloud where Rosenstein’s true loyalties lay, tweeting on June 16, “I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! Witch Hunt.”

The Trump-Russia probe could be in serious trouble

Rosenstein didn’t stop Mueller from pursuing the investigation the way he saw fit, and he made every indication that he intended to continue letting Mueller proceed with his investigation.

But if Rosenstein is fired or resigns, Francisco could change all that, especially if Trump applies significant pressure. That said, if Francisco did fire Mueller, the investigation might not be completely undermined, as five Trump associates have pleaded guilty and prosecutors are likely to continue to follow leads from the beginning of the investigation in June 2016.

And the future is still very unclear. If Francisco doesn’t do Trump’s bidding, the president could simply fire him. That’s possibly more detrimental to the Mueller probe.

Asha Rangappa, a legal expert at Yale's Jackson Institute for Global Affairs, wrote in a post for the Just Security blog last December that a new deputy attorney general could effectively cripple the Mueller investigation by rejecting Mueller’s requests to investigate more people, obtain new evidence, or pursue charges against additional people, for instance.

In effect, Rosenstein’s possible ouster now has put the Mueller probe in its most precarious position to date — possibly allowing Trump to escape further investigation into him, his associates, and his family.",www.vox.com,left,atA8pyENaGlgIQvb

justice,The Intercept,0,https://theintercept.com/2020/04/28/ice-detention-coronavirus-videos/,Women in ICE detention face reprisals for speaking up about fears of COVID-19,2020-04-28,,"As Covid-19 cases spread though Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centers across the U.S. , immigrants locked inside are frantic that they could get sick and die . They are using innovative methods to tell the public about their fears , even as some of their jailers try to silence them , including by locking them in segregation . That is what happened on April 21 to five women at the Irwin County Detention Center in rural Georgia . Using a video-teleconferencing app available to detainees in many ICE facilities , they called one woman ’ s boyfriend , who recorded them describing overcrowding , deficient sanitation , and other conditions at Irwin that made them feel terrified about contracting Covid-19 . One woman began sobbing as she begged to be released . The resulting video ended up on Spanish-language television , social media , and YouTube . In the video , the women said they knew they risked retaliation for going public . Their concerns proved well-founded . Now , according to a lawyer who represents one of them , they are crying at night , knocking on the walls to comfort one another , and screaming through the food slots to talk . The women at Irwin had good reason to fear the spread of the virus . By press time , ICE had reported that 375 immigrants detained nationwide were infected with Covid-19 , as well as 35 ICE employees working at detention facilities .
Detainees are using the jailhouse equivalent of FaceTime or Zoom to speak to the outside world .
ICE has released at least 700 people who have tested positive for Covid-19 or have underlying medical conditions that put them at especially high risk should they become infected . And on April 20 , a federal judge in California ordered the agency to identify all vulnerable immigrants in its custody by the end of the month , including those who are 55 or older , are pregnant , have cancer , or have cardiovascular or respiratory diseases . When the court decision came down , ICE counted about 31,000 immigrants in its detention centers . The agency will not release an updated figure until later this week , but over the last few days , ███ has spoken with immigrants who have medical conditions such as diabetes and cancer who remain in detention . Among the many still locked up , some are using the jailhouse equivalent of FaceTime or Zoom to speak to the outside world . A few years ago , prison phone companies , including Global Tel-Link Corp. , started marketing digital tablets to jails , prisons , and ICE detention facilities . Via the internet , applications such as GTL ’ s “ GettingOut ” provide inmates with audiovisual interaction with the outside world . The sessions cost 21 to 25 cents a minute .
Video visitation is officially meant to encourage socializing with friends and family , and it has become ubiquitous as more and more jails and prisons ban in-person visits — a trend that has intensified because of Covid-19 . But lately , applications like GettingOut are also being deployed by people in detention to advocate for their rights . As their grainy images fill the screens of people who get the calls , detainees present evidence of severe crowding in ICE facilities , a lack of personal protective equipment , and their belief that their dorm-mates are sick with Covid-19 but their cases are unreported . They ask politicians and the public to help them . Groups often take turns speaking one by one , holding handmade signs . Loved ones , immigrant advocates , and journalists are recording these GettingOut sessions . After the media publishes the videos , detainees have been punished — and not just at Irwin . At the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center , for instance , women who made a video had their access to phone calls and television temporarily cut off and video visitation hours permanently reduced . They were threatened with criminal charges if they made more videos , and staff have apparently impeded my ability to use GettingOut to communicate with detainees . The reprisals violate the immigrants ’ First Amendment rights to free expression , the media ’ s rights to communicate with sources , and the public ’ s right to be informed . A Chilling Message On April 17 , three of the women at Irwin used GettingOut to speak with ███ about what had prompted them to make the video . They said they had learned from the news on April 10 that a detained person at Irwin had tested positive for Covid-19 . One woman said her dorm supervisor told her that another detainee was also infected . ICE ’ s online list of Covid-19 cases now includes two detainees at Irwin , which is owned by LaSalle Corrections . LaSalle facilities hold 22 percent of all ICE detainees reportedly infected with the virus . The women talked all weekend and decided that they needed to do something . On Sunday , April 12 , they conducted their group GettingOut session with Anthony , the boyfriend of one of the detained women . She and the others held signs in Spanish and talked about trying to protect themselves against Covid-19 by making face masks out of socks . One speaker described the group ’ s fear that “ they ’ ll retaliate against us for speaking out . We are afraid they ’ ll put us in solitary confinement. ” By Tuesday , the video was being published in Spanish-language media in the U.S . Images of men protesting at Irwin , taken from GettingOut recordings , were also aired .

Then the visual and audio functions of GettingOut ceased to work at the facility for several days . “ You can still use it for texting , ” the mother of one of the detainees told ███ . “ When you try to do a video visit , you just get a white screen. ” Telephones remained available , but many relatives — including this mother — live outside of the U.S. and can ’ t receive calls from prison phones . “ I haven ’ t been able for days to talk to my daughter , ” she said . Tablet and GettingOut service was finally restored on the morning of April 17 . Irwin detainee Diana Cruz Casas has lived in the U.S. since she was a young child . Via telephone and then GettingOut just after service came back on , she told me that she and her dorm-mates had met with an ICE staffer a few days earlier to discuss their grievances and left feeling humiliated and terrified . Cruz Casas , who was asked to translate because the staffer did not speak Spanish , had to relay his chilling remarks to the rest of the women . “ He said that ICE can ’ t do anything if we get sick , ” Cruz Casas said . “ That the hospitals are filled and there ’ s no place to send us . He said that ICE ’ s only job is to deport us , and they make their money doing that . He said we were like roaches that ICE keeps in boxes . To make money. ” Another detainee who attended the meeting told me via GettingOut that she was “ broken by what he said . It is as though we are animals . And there is no one who cares whether we live or die. ” “ He had on a face mask , ” another detainee recalled . “ We have no face masks or any other protection . ”
███ asked Bryan Cox , ICE ’ s southern region public affairs director , to respond to the fact that detainees were being punished for using GettingOut to communicate with the press . Their access , he wrote , “ may be restricted or limited to prevent interference with orderly operation of the facility . Group protest activities clearly potentially fall within the scope of the standard. ” Cox further wrote that “ you are referencing persons who are under arrest and detained in the custody of a federal law enforcement agency. ” In retrospect , his statement was ominous . On April 21 , four days after my conversation with Cruz Casas , she and four other women , including some I had spoken with on GettingOut , were removed from their dorms , most in handcuffs , and put into solitary confinement . They had no access to phones and for the first few days were held incommunicado . Their families were frantic . Ana Fuentes , an immigration attorney in Atlanta , had a standing weekly Skype meeting with one of the women , but she didn ’ t show up for the appointment . “ I ’ ve never had this happen with any client , ” Fuentes said . She was unable to get information about the woman ’ s whereabouts .
On April 24 , Diego Sanchez , an attorney at the Southern Poverty Law Center ’ s Southeast Immigrant Freedom Initiative who represents Anthony ’ s girlfriend , called his client for a scheduled meeting via Skype . She appeared on the screen . Sanchez told me that his client said six guards brought her to the Skype room in handcuffs . She told Sanchez that officials had ordered the women to sign papers admitting that they had acted improperly by making the video . She refused . Cox did not respond to questions from ███ about the reported retaliation against the five women . One woman was released after a day , not only from solitary but also from ICE detention . She is with family now and has told Anthony that she does not want to speak publicly about what happened at Irwin . “ She was told that if she did that , it would make things worse for the women being punished , ” Anthony told ███ . The other four women remain locked up . Sanchez ’ s client was allowed to call Anthony on Saturday . Another woman , who was able to call her aunt in the U.S. , said she had not signed the “ guilt ” paper either . Both women said they have been told that they will stay in solitary for two weeks . A Pattern of Punishment Irwin is not the only ICE jail where immigrants are facing reprisals for trying to talk publicly about their conditions of confinement . The nonprofit group Freedom for Immigrants , which monitors human and civil rights violations against immigrants in detention , posts reports of ICE facilities where organizing has occurred in response to the Covid-19 threat : everything from hunger strikes to petitions to visitation videos for the public . Last week , Freedom for Immigrants counted 29 detention facilities where these actions have taken place . Another organization , Perilous Chronicle , told ███ last week that it had counted 34 ICE-related actions protesting Covid-19 conditions . The group thinks the actual number is much higher . According to Freedom for Immigrants and Perilous Chronicle , several facilities have retaliated against detained people trying to organize .
In late March , I was contacted by several women held in the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center , a rural detention facility about three hours from New Orleans managed by the private prison company the Geo Group . The women spoke to me by phone and GettingOut about their fears of contracting the deadly virus . To date , the Geo Group ’ s facilities have contributed 14 percent of reported Covid-19 cases among ICE employees and detainees . One woman said she knew English and was going to help the others write signs in that language . As I pointed my smartphone at my computer screen , several women took turns silently displaying handwritten signs that described a sick woman in their midst who appeared to have Covid-19 , the crowded conditions , and their terror of getting sick . But before they finished , they suddenly scattered . A guard could be heard yelling and demanding the signs . The video abruptly ended .
The next day , the lead organizer called me . She said that immediately after the incident , the women ’ s access to telephones , tablets , and television was denied for hours . In addition , some of those who ’ d participated in the video were asked for their IDs and told that they would be investigated and punished . On March 30 , ███ ran my story about South Louisiana , accompanied by the women ’ s video . By then , the phones and GettingOut application had been turned back on . The lead organizer told me that South Louisiana ’ s warden , Indalecio Ramos , interrogated them to learn who made the video and said that if anyone made more videos for the media , they would be disciplined . They would not be able to use the tablets for at least two weeks . The facility decreased tablet usage from 15 minutes to 10 minutes per visit and limited their availability to nine hours a day on weekdays , down from 14 hours .
The warden has sent detainees at least one memo threatening criminal charges if they “ incite ” a “ group demonstration . ”
Ramos has since sent detainees at least one memo threatening criminal charges if more than one of them at a time uses a tablet or if they “ incite ” a “ group demonstration. ” The memo mandates that anyone who wants to use a tablet must first show identification , sign a logbook , and then employ cardboard partitions that hide the detainees from one another . Earlier , no ID was required and the partitions were voluntary . Reporters , too , are experiencing reprisals . ICE ’ s rules about detainees speaking to the media are based on pre-technology days , when journalists had to make a written request to ICE for an in-person interview . ICE ’ s own standards specify that “ detainees should not be pressured or coerced out of granting the interview request , nor should the facility in any way retaliate against a detainee for lawful communication with a member of the media or a member of the public. ” Now , however , ICE facilities are trying to prevent GettingOut communication between the press and detained people . On April 22 , after I noticed that I was unable to use the app to reach sources in several ICE facilities , I called GettingOut ’ s customer service line . A representative told me that I had been blocked the day before , because of a request submitted by “ staff ” at the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center . She said the request resulted in my being blocked from all facilities that use GettingOut . Three days later I checked again , spoke with another customer service person , and was again told that “ staff ” had asked for the block . But “ it ’ s really odd , ” the representative said . “ There ’ s no notes ” indicating which facility requested the block . Nevertheless , he added , “ It seems that your account is suspended until 2025 . ”
I am not the only journalist whose ability to interview ICE detainees about Covid-19 has been disrupted . Laura Morel of Reveal , from the Center for Investigative Reporting , published a report on April 7 based on GettingOut sessions she recorded with people locked up at the Pine Prairie ICE Processing Center . Two days later , Morel told ███ , she tried to do follow-up GettingOut sessions with two of her sources but was unable to contact them because their screens read “ SUSPENDED. ” She called their family members , who said the same thing was happening to them . Reveal ’ s general counsel , Victoria Baranetsky , sent a cease-and-desist letter to Pine Prairie regarding what she described as “ putative retaliatory actions ” that would constitute “ a clear violation of the detainees ’ First Amendment privileges as well as Reveal ’ s and the public ’ s rights to receive information about issues of significant national concern. ” Pine Prairie is currently reporting 17 detainees infected with Covid-19 .","As Covid-19 cases spread though Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centers across the U.S., immigrants locked inside are frantic that they could get sick and die.

They said they had learned from the news on April 10 that a detained person at Irwin had tested positive for Covid-19. One woman said her dorm supervisor told her that another detainee was also infected. ICE’s online list of Covid-19 cases now includes two detainees at Irwin, which is owned by LaSalle Corrections. LaSalle facilities hold 22 percent of all ICE detainees reportedly infected with the virus. The women talked all weekend and decided that they needed to do something. On Sunday, April 12, they conducted their group GettingOut session with Anthony, the boyfriend of one of the detained women. She and the others held signs in Spanish and talked about trying to protect themselves against Covid-19 by making face masks out of socks. One speaker described the group’s fear that “they’ll retaliate against us for speaking out. We are afraid they’ll put us in solitary confinement.” By Tuesday, the video was being published in Spanish-language media in the U.S. Images of men protesting at Irwin, taken from GettingOut recordings, were also aired.

Then the visual and audio functions of GettingOut ceased to work at the facility for several days. “You can still use it for texting,” the mother of one of the detainees told The Intercept. “When you try to do a video visit, you just get a white screen.” Telephones remained available, but many relatives — including this mother — live outside of the U.S. and can’t receive calls from prison phones. “I haven’t been able for days to talk to my daughter,” she said. Tablet and GettingOut service was finally restored on the morning of April 17. Irwin detainee Diana Cruz Casas has lived in the U.S. since she was a young child. Via telephone and then GettingOut just after service came back on, she told me that she and her dorm-mates had met with an ICE staffer a few days earlier to discuss their grievances and left feeling humiliated and terrified. Cruz Casas, who was asked to translate because the staffer did not speak Spanish, had to relay his chilling remarks to the rest of the women. “He said that ICE can’t do anything if we get sick,” Cruz Casas said. “That the hospitals are filled and there’s no place to send us. He said that ICE’s only job is to deport us, and they make their money doing that. He said we were like roaches that ICE keeps in boxes. To make money.” Another detainee who attended the meeting told me via GettingOut that she was “broken by what he said. It is as though we are animals. And there is no one who cares whether we live or die.” “He had on a face mask,” another detainee recalled. “We have no face masks or any other protection.”

The Intercept asked Bryan Cox, ICE’s southern region public affairs director, to respond to the fact that detainees were being punished for using GettingOut to communicate with the press. Their access, he wrote, “may be restricted or limited to prevent interference with orderly operation of the facility. Group protest activities clearly potentially fall within the scope of the standard.” Cox further wrote that “you are referencing persons who are under arrest and detained in the custody of a federal law enforcement agency.” In retrospect, his statement was ominous. On April 21, four days after my conversation with Cruz Casas, she and four other women, including some I had spoken with on GettingOut, were removed from their dorms, most in handcuffs, and put into solitary confinement. They had no access to phones and for the first few days were held incommunicado. Their families were frantic. Ana Fuentes, an immigration attorney in Atlanta, had a standing weekly Skype meeting with one of the women, but she didn’t show up for the appointment. “I’ve never had this happen with any client,” Fuentes said. She was unable to get information about the woman’s whereabouts.

They were held incommunicado. Their families were frantic.

On April 24, Diego Sanchez, an attorney at the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Southeast Immigrant Freedom Initiative who represents Anthony’s girlfriend, called his client for a scheduled meeting via Skype. She appeared on the screen. Sanchez told me that his client said six guards brought her to the Skype room in handcuffs. She told Sanchez that officials had ordered the women to sign papers admitting that they had acted improperly by making the video. She refused. Cox did not respond to questions from The Intercept about the reported retaliation against the five women. One woman was released after a day, not only from solitary but also from ICE detention. She is with family now and has told Anthony that she does not want to speak publicly about what happened at Irwin. “She was told that if she did that, it would make things worse for the women being punished,” Anthony told The Intercept. The other four women remain locked up. Sanchez’s client was allowed to call Anthony on Saturday. Another woman, who was able to call her aunt in the U.S., said she had not signed the “guilt” paper either. Both women said they have been told that they will stay in solitary for two weeks. A Pattern of Punishment Irwin is not the only ICE jail where immigrants are facing reprisals for trying to talk publicly about their conditions of confinement. The nonprofit group Freedom for Immigrants, which monitors human and civil rights violations against immigrants in detention, posts reports of ICE facilities where organizing has occurred in response to the Covid-19 threat: everything from hunger strikes to petitions to visitation videos for the public. Last week, Freedom for Immigrants counted 29 detention facilities where these actions have taken place. Another organization, Perilous Chronicle, told The Intercept last week that it had counted 34 ICE-related actions protesting Covid-19 conditions. The group thinks the actual number is much higher. According to Freedom for Immigrants and Perilous Chronicle, several facilities have retaliated against detained people trying to organize.

In late March, I was contacted by several women held in the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center, a rural detention facility about three hours from New Orleans managed by the private prison company the Geo Group. The women spoke to me by phone and GettingOut about their fears of contracting the deadly virus. To date, the Geo Group’s facilities have contributed 14 percent of reported Covid-19 cases among ICE employees and detainees. One woman said she knew English and was going to help the others write signs in that language. As I pointed my smartphone at my computer screen, several women took turns silently displaying handwritten signs that described a sick woman in their midst who appeared to have Covid-19, the crowded conditions, and their terror of getting sick. But before they finished, they suddenly scattered. A guard could be heard yelling and demanding the signs. The video abruptly ended.

The next day, the lead organizer called me. She said that immediately after the incident, the women’s access to telephones, tablets, and television was denied for hours. In addition, some of those who’d participated in the video were asked for their IDs and told that they would be investigated and punished. On March 30, The Intercept ran my story about South Louisiana, accompanied by the women’s video. By then, the phones and GettingOut application had been turned back on. The lead organizer told me that South Louisiana’s warden, Indalecio Ramos, interrogated them to learn who made the video and said that if anyone made more videos for the media, they would be disciplined. They would not be able to use the tablets for at least two weeks. The facility decreased tablet usage from 15 minutes to 10 minutes per visit and limited their availability to nine hours a day on weekdays, down from 14 hours.

The warden has sent detainees at least one memo threatening criminal charges if they “incite” a “group demonstration.”

Ramos has since sent detainees at least one memo threatening criminal charges if more than one of them at a time uses a tablet or if they “incite” a “group demonstration.” The memo mandates that anyone who wants to use a tablet must first show identification, sign a logbook, and then employ cardboard partitions that hide the detainees from one another. Earlier, no ID was required and the partitions were voluntary. Reporters, too, are experiencing reprisals. ICE’s rules about detainees speaking to the media are based on pre-technology days, when journalists had to make a written request to ICE for an in-person interview. ICE’s own standards specify that “detainees should not be pressured or coerced out of granting the interview request, nor should the facility in any way retaliate against a detainee for lawful communication with a member of the media or a member of the public.” Now, however, ICE facilities are trying to prevent GettingOut communication between the press and detained people. On April 22, after I noticed that I was unable to use the app to reach sources in several ICE facilities, I called GettingOut’s customer service line. A representative told me that I had been blocked the day before, because of a request submitted by “staff” at the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center. She said the request resulted in my being blocked from all facilities that use GettingOut. Three days later I checked again, spoke with another customer service person, and was again told that “staff” had asked for the block. But “it’s really odd,” the representative said. “There’s no notes” indicating which facility requested the block. Nevertheless, he added, “It seems that your account is suspended until 2025.”

I am not the only journalist whose ability to interview ICE detainees about Covid-19 has been disrupted. Laura Morel of Reveal, from the Center for Investigative Reporting, published a report on April 7 based on GettingOut sessions she recorded with people locked up at the Pine Prairie ICE Processing Center. Two days later, Morel told The Intercept, she tried to do follow-up GettingOut sessions with two of her sources but was unable to contact them because their screens read “SUSPENDED.” She called their family members, who said the same thing was happening to them. Reveal’s general counsel, Victoria Baranetsky, sent a cease-and-desist letter to Pine Prairie regarding what she described as “putative retaliatory actions” that would constitute “a clear violation of the detainees’ First Amendment privileges as well as Reveal’s and the public’s rights to receive information about issues of significant national concern.” Pine Prairie is currently reporting 17 detainees infected with Covid-19.

justice,American Spectator,2,https://spectator.org/andrew-mccabe-and-james-comey-deserve-each-other/,Andrew McCabe and James Comey Deserve Each Other,,"George Parry, Jeffrey Lord, Wesley J. Smith, Jed Babbin","According to the just released report by the Justice Department ’ s Office of Inspector General , former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe wrongfully caused sensitive law enforcement information to be leaked to the Wall Street Journal and then lied to investigators about having done so . The report runs thirty-five single spaced pages and lays out in excruciating , meticulous , and damning detail how McCabe authorized an anonymous leak calculated to make it appear that he had resisted pressure by Loretta Lynch ’ s Justice Department to close down the FBI ’ s investigation of the Clinton Foundation during the 2016 election campaign and then proceeded to cover his tracks with lies .
As spelled out by the OIG , McCabe ’ s troubles started on October 23 , 2016 , when the Wall Street Journal published an article by reporter Devlin Barrett stating that political action committees run by Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe and the Virginia Democratic Party ( over which the article reported McAuliffe “ exerts considerable control ” ) had donated almost $ 675,000 to the failed 2015 state senate campaign of McCabe ’ s wife . The article described McAuliffe as “ an influential Democrat with long-standing ties to Bill and Hilary Clinton. ” It stated that McCabe was an FBI official “ who later helped oversee the investigation ” into Secretary of State Hilary Clinton ’ s use of an unsecured private email server .
The article noted that , when the investigation of Clinton ’ s emails was launched in July 2015 , McCabe was “ running the FBI ’ s Washington , D.C. field office , which provided personnel and resources to the Clinton email probe . ”
By October 25 , 2016 , McCabe had learned that Barrett was working on a follow-up story that would cover McCabe ’ s oversight of the FBI ’ s investigation of the Clinton Foundation and potential connections with McAuliffe-controlled campaign contributions to McCabe ’ s wife . Consequently , McCabe directed FBI lawyer Lisa Page to discuss the upcoming article with Barrett . Ultimately , McCabe directed Page to tell Barrett about how McCabe had resisted pressure to shut down the FBI ’ s investigation of the Clinton Foundation in a telephone conversation with a high Justice Department official .
On October 30 , 2016 , Barrett reported in the Wall Street Journal that McCabe “ was caught… [ in ] an increasingly acrimonious fight for control between the Justice Department and FBI agents pursuing the Clinton Foundation case. ” It further highlighted the campaign donations to McCabe ’ s wife by political action committees associated with McAuliffe , who was described as a “ longtime ally of the Clinton ’ s and… a Clinton Foundation Board member . ”
The article identified McCabe as the FBI official who “ sought to refocus the Clinton Foundation probe , ” and reported that agents “ further down the FBI chain of command ” had been told to “ [ s ] tand down ” on the Clinton Foundation investigation with the understanding that “ the order had come from the deputy director — Mr. McCabe. ” The article stated that “ [ o ] thers familiar with the matter deny Mr. McCabe or any other senior FBI official gave such a stand-down instruction. ” In support of this latter point , the article recounted an August 12 , 2016 telephone conversation between McCabe and a senior Justice Department official as follows :
According to a person familiar with the probes , on Aug. 12 , a senior Justice Department official called Mr. McCabe to voice his displeasure at finding that New York FBI agents were still openly pursuing the Clinton Foundation probe during the election season . Mr. McCabe said agents still had the authority to pursue the issue as long as they didn ’ t use overt methods requiring Justice Department approvals . The Justice Department official was “ very pissed off , ” according to one person close to McCabe , and pressed him to explain why the FBI was still chasing a matter the department considered dormant… “ Are you telling me that I need to shut down a validly predicated investigation ? ” Mr. McCabe asked , according to people familiar with the conversation . After a pause , the official replied “ Of course not , ” these people said .
This leaked story of McCabe ’ s bureaucratic heroism was calculated to override the claims by those agents lower down the FBI food chain who said that McCabe had shut down the Clinton Foundation investigation . But , for whatever short term benefit McCabe may have derived from the favorable publicity , it started an investigation by the FBI ’ s Inspection Division to find the source of the leaked information about his telephone call .
The OIG report sets forth how McCabe denied to FBI Director James Comey that he had anything to do with the leak , and then repeated his denials under oath to the FBI Inspection Division agents . But , as the evidence contradicting his story mounted and the noose tightened , McCabe began changing his story to fit the emerging facts until ultimately he admitted to the agents that he was the source of the leak .
At that point the FBI turned the matter over to the OIG . Here again , McCabe lied under oath when he told the OIG ’ s investigators that he was not aware of whether FBI lawyer Page had ever been authorized to speak to reporters .
There are many more twists and turns in the OIG report . But , after conducting its exhaustive investigation , the OIG has now concluded that McCabe was guilty of “ lack of candor ” ( i.e. , lying ) at least three times under oath ( a ) regarding his responsibility for the leak and ( b ) in his descriptions of what he had told investigators and how the investigators had conducted their interviews of him . His characterizations of the agent interviews were calculated to portray his instances of “ lack of candor ” as honest mistakes and the product of mere inadvertence .
The OIG also has concluded that McCabe lied to Comey when he denied knowing who had leaked the information about the Clinton Foundation investigation and then lied to investigators about his interaction with Comey .
When McCabe was fired on the recommendation of the FBI ’ s Office of Professional Responsibility , he claimed in an op-ed published by the Washington Post that he was a victim of “ divisive politics and partisan attacks. ” His wife followed up in a Post op-ed in which she blamed “ the president ’ s wrath . ”
Michael Bromwich , McCabe ’ s lawyer , has released a statement that his client ’ s treatment was “ far more harsh and less fair than he deserved , ” and that the OIG ’ s report “ utterly failed to support the decision to terminate Mr. McCabe . ”
But , as the former Deputy Director of the FBI , McCabe must certainly understand that lying to federal agents is a crime . If he has any doubts or questions about how that works , he should check with General Michael Flynn . Since McCabe is now facing possible criminal prosecution for his lies under oath , he would seem to be ineligible for further employment by the world ’ s greatest law enforcement agency .
In his cover letter to the report , Inspector General Michael Horowitz stated that the OIG ’ s “ election-related review ” will be completed by mid-May . Presumably this will deal with the matters mentioned in the just-released report such as who shut down the Clinton Foundation investigation and why .
And what about the FBI ’ s fake , Potemkin investigation of Hilary Clinton ’ s emails ? Who scripted and directed that vaudeville act ? McCabe ? Comey ? Both ? Hopefully , the answers to all those questions and more will be forthcoming when the OIG issues its second report in a matter of weeks .
Moreover , thanks to the OIG ’ s careful work , we now face the enticing prospect of a public swearing contest between McCabe and Comey as to who said what to whom in their discussion of the leak . Although the OIG accepted Comey ’ s version of events , McCabe insists that Comey is lying when he claims that McCabe did not tell him about the leak .
Comey told investigators that McCabe “ definitely did not tell me that he authorized ” the leak . He continued that , “ I have a strong impression that he conveyed to me , ‘ it wasn ’ t me boss. ’ And I don ’ t think that was by saying those words , I think it was most likely by saying ‘ I don ’ t know how this s— gets in the media or why would people talk about this kind of thing , ’ words that I would fairly take as ‘ I , Andy , didn ’ t do it . ’ ”
But McCabe ’ s lawyers claim that emails between their client and Comey “ clearly show that Mr. McCabe specifically advised Director Comey that he was working with colleagues at the FBI to correct inaccuracies in the [ Wall Street Journal ] story before it was published , and that they remained in contact through the week end while the work was taking place . ”
So , was Comey complicit with McCabe in leaking the sensitive law enforcement information ? That would certainly be consistent with Comey ’ s outrageous and cowardly leak through a third party to the New York Times of his memoranda of private conversations with the president . In this one instance , McCabe may actually be telling the truth when he says that Comey approved the leak .
Where does all this leave us ? On the road to good times , that ’ s where . Think about it . This is shaping up to be major entertainment as the sanctimonious , self-aggrandizing drama queen former FBI Director and his scheming deputy try to out swear one another over Comey ’ s participation in the leak . This spectacle , starring the leaders of the Obama era FBI , will hardly be a remake of “ The FBI in Peace and War ” or similar Hoover era offerings . Instead , it will more closely resemble “ Bumfights , the Thrilla ’ in D.C. ” as these two shameless , shifty , self-promoters rip each other apart .
Happily , neither of the participants in that demolition derby will be of much value to Special Counsel Mueller ’ s anti-Trump snipe hunt .
And here ’ s another exciting possibility that is almost too good to be true . McCabe ’ s lawyer says that his client is considering filing a defamation suit against the president and others . For what , besmirching his terrific reputation for honesty and truthfulness ?
If McCabe sues for libel or slander , his entire existence from cradle to today will become an open book . Every nook and cranny of his life , finances , marriage , work , and reputation will be fair game for ruthless exploration and exploitation by defense counsel . He may think he ’ s been thoroughly investigated , but he hasn ’ t seen anything until defense counsel in a defamation suit finishes tearing his life and reputation apart .
Though this first OIG report is narrowly focused on one single leak to the media and its attendant cover up , it ’ s a good omen of great things to come .

justice,Fox Online News,2,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-reshapes-9th-circuit-gop-judges-near-majority,"Trump reshapes long-liberal 9th Circuit, as Republican-appointed judges gain seats on court",,Gregg Re,"For the first time in more than three decades , Republican-appointed judges will soon occupy nearly half the seats on the left-leaning 9th Circuit Court of Appeals -- dealing a setback to progressive legal advocates who have long seen the court as a safe bet for favorable rulings .
The radical transformation of the San Francisco-based court is largely the result of President Trump 's aggressive push to nominate conservative judges and bypass traditional consultations with Senate Democrats -- a practice that has led to repeated howls of protest from California 's two Democratic senators , Kamala Harris and Judiciary Committee ranking member Dianne Feinstein . The 9th Circuit has a sprawling purview over cases arising in nine western states , including California , Hawaii , and Oregon .
Once Trump 's latest picks to the 9th Circuit , including Ken Lee and Dan Collins , are confirmed as expected and remaining vacancies are filled , 13 of the 29 active seats on the key appellate court will be filled with judges picked by Republican presidents . At this time last year , 16 judges on the 9th Circuit were appointed by Democrats , with only six chosen by Republicans .
`` As the 9th Circuit shifts to become more conservative and better parallels the Supreme Court 's ideological baseline , I could only imagine fewer liberal 9th Circuit decisions and fewer overturned 9th Circuit decisions generally , '' legal scholar and judicial data guru Adam Feldman , who blogs at Empirical SCOTUS , told Fox News .
TRUMP : 9TH CIRCUIT WOULD OVERTURN MY THANKSGIVING TURKEY PARDON IF IT COULD
`` As a general statement , with the death of [ 9th Circuit Judge Stephen ] Reinhardt and Trump 's push for conservative judges to fill the circuit , I suspect that there will be a noticeable shift in a portion of ideological case outcomes , '' Feldman added .
The circuit has had a reputation for seeing its decisions reversed by the Supreme Court . But citing data from the Supreme Court Database , which is widely used by scholars , Feldman noted that the number of liberal decisions from the 9th Circuit that the Supreme Court has chosen to review has diminished since the beginning days of the Roberts Court in 2006 .
`` The general notion that the Supreme Court may not be looking to overturn liberal 9th Circuit decisions to the same extent as it has in the past is clear , '' Feldman said .
Cases before the 9th Circuit are typically heard by randomly selected three-judge panels , out of a pool that includes the 29 active judges and a group of several senior status judges , which is currently evenly divided among conservative and liberal jurists . In certain cases , the entire 9th Circuit can choose to hear a case en banc , which would result in a randomly chosen 11-member panel reviewing the three-judge panel 's decision .
In both scenarios , conservative judges will soon have a historically high chance to occupy the majority on the panels . That 's good news for Republicans , who have complained that the 9th Circuit has repeatedly stood in the way of the Trump administration with a slew of injunctions on matters like asylum law and the travel ban , only to later be overturned by the Supreme Court .
“ We ’ re very happy to have these extraordinary nominees , ” Carrie Severino , chief counsel for the Judicial Crisis Network , told The Daily Signal in February . “ It doesn ’ t change the [ 9th Circuit ] majority to Republican nominees . But when we are talking about future three-judge panels , the odds are a lot better . ”
Feldman has found that , while the 9th Circuit 's decisions are more often reviewed by the Supreme Court , that owes to its large caseload and sweeping purview over several Western states . The 9th Circuit is overturned in 79 percent of the cases taken by the Supreme Court , Feldman found -- more than any other appellate court except the Sixth Circuit , although three other courts have an overturn rate above 70 percent .
Many of the 9th Circuit 's cases , however , have been high-profile , with sweeping implications for executive power and the Trump administration 's agenda . Just weeks ago , the 9th Circuit broke ranks with another federal appellate court and ruled that a Sri Lankan man who failed his initial asylum screening had the constitutional right to go before a judge -- threatening to clog the immigration court system further with tens of thousands of similar claims per year and setting up a likely Supreme Court showdown .
Meanwhile , left-leaning legal groups repeatedly have brought big cases directly to the 9th Circuit during the Trump administration . Ben Feuer , one of the top appellate litigators in California and chairman of the California Appellate Law Group , told Fox News that progressives are unlikely to look to other circuits now that the 9th Circuit is turning more conservative .
`` Aside from the 9th Circuit , only the Second and Eleventh Circuits currently have a majority of Democratic appointees ( the Tenth is tied ) , '' Feuer said . `` The Second Circuit is +5 Democratic by my count and the Eleventh is +2 Democratic . Those are n't very significant differentials -- certainly not on par with the Ninth Circuit of yore . ''
Feuer added : `` Now , if the trend continues , that could certainly change , but I do n't know that filing suit with left-leaning outcome goals in New York or Miami is very likely to get a much different result than in San Francisco , Los Angeles , or Seattle . Also , many of the more progressive state statutes being enacted are coming from the experimental West Coast cities and states , so those have to be litigated in the Ninth Circuit anyway . ''
In televised remarks last Thursday , Feinstein warned that a future Democratic administration would immediately move to load the 9th Circuit with more liberal justices , given the Trump administration 's no-compromise approach . But , Feuer said , that may not be entirely within Democrats ' control .
`` We 're only recently into the filibuster-free 'post-nuclear ' era in judicial appointments , in which simple majorities in the Senate can confirm nominations , '' Feuer said . `` That means that if a party controls both the presidency and the Senate , they 'll get in pretty much whoever they want -- so if the Democrats get both , there will surely be some vacancies and the balance may well shift back ... But we do n't really know what it means when the presidency and the Senate are split . ''
He noted that in such scenarios in the past , the president would tend to compromise with more center-leaning nominees but questioned whether that would be the case going forward .
`` Perhaps a split between the presidency and the Senate would mean no new appointments of any kind , '' Feuer speculated .
The 9th Circuit , meanwhile , could still grow . The Judicial Conference of the United States , which was created by Congress to advise on federal court matters , has recommended creating five new appellate judge positions and 17 new trial judge positions for the 9th Circuit , given its growing caseload .
Should Congress opt to create those five slots -- in the same way the post-Watergate Democrat-controlled Congress added 10 judges to the 9th circuit in the late 1970s -- GOP appointees could surge to an unprecedented 18-16 majority on the 9th Circuit .
Such a move , however , would require the consent of the House , which is currently under Democratic control .","For the first time in more than three decades, Republican-appointed judges will soon occupy nearly half the seats on the left-leaning 9th Circuit Court of Appeals -- dealing a setback to progressive legal advocates who have long seen the court as a safe bet for favorable rulings.

The radical transformation of the San Francisco-based court is largely the result of President Trump's aggressive push to nominate conservative judges and bypass traditional consultations with Senate Democrats -- a practice that has led to repeated howls of protest from California's two Democratic senators, Kamala Harris and Judiciary Committee ranking member Dianne Feinstein. The 9th Circuit has a sprawling purview over cases arising in nine western states, including California, Hawaii, and Oregon.

Once Trump's latest picks to the 9th Circuit, including Ken Lee and Dan Collins, are confirmed as expected and remaining vacancies are filled, 13 of the 29 active seats on the key appellate court will be filled with judges picked by Republican presidents. At this time last year, 16 judges on the 9th Circuit were appointed by Democrats, with only six chosen by Republicans.

""As the 9th Circuit shifts to become more conservative and better parallels the Supreme Court's ideological baseline, I could only imagine fewer liberal 9th Circuit decisions and fewer overturned 9th Circuit decisions generally,"" legal scholar and judicial data guru Adam Feldman, who blogs at Empirical SCOTUS, told Fox News.

TRUMP: 9TH CIRCUIT WOULD OVERTURN MY THANKSGIVING TURKEY PARDON IF IT COULD

""As a general statement, with the death of [9th Circuit Judge Stephen] Reinhardt and Trump's push for conservative judges to fill the circuit, I suspect that there will be a noticeable shift in a portion of ideological case outcomes,"" Feldman added.

The circuit has had a reputation for seeing its decisions reversed by the Supreme Court. But citing data from the Supreme Court Database, which is widely used by scholars, Feldman noted that the number of liberal decisions from the 9th Circuit that the Supreme Court has chosen to review has diminished since the beginning days of the Roberts Court in 2006.

""The general notion that the Supreme Court may not be looking to overturn liberal 9th Circuit decisions to the same extent as it has in the past is clear,"" Feldman said.

Cases before the 9th Circuit are typically heard by randomly selected three-judge panels, out of a pool that includes the 29 active judges and a group of several senior status judges, which is currently evenly divided among conservative and liberal jurists. In certain cases, the entire 9th Circuit can choose to hear a case en banc, which would result in a randomly chosen 11-member panel reviewing the three-judge panel's decision.

In both scenarios, conservative judges will soon have a historically high chance to occupy the majority on the panels. That's good news for Republicans, who have complained that the 9th Circuit has repeatedly stood in the way of the Trump administration with a slew of injunctions on matters like asylum law and the travel ban, only to later be overturned by the Supreme Court.

“We’re very happy to have these extraordinary nominees,” Carrie Severino, chief counsel for the Judicial Crisis Network, told The Daily Signal in February. “It doesn’t change the [9th Circuit] majority to Republican nominees. But when we are talking about future three-judge panels, the odds are a lot better.”

Feldman has found that, while the 9th Circuit's decisions are more often reviewed by the Supreme Court, that owes to its large caseload and sweeping purview over several Western states. The 9th Circuit is overturned in 79 percent of the cases taken by the Supreme Court, Feldman found -- more than any other appellate court except the Sixth Circuit, although three other courts have an overturn rate above 70 percent.

Many of the 9th Circuit's cases, however, have been high-profile, with sweeping implications for executive power and the Trump administration's agenda. Just weeks ago, the 9th Circuit broke ranks with another federal appellate court and ruled that a Sri Lankan man who failed his initial asylum screening had the constitutional right to go before a judge -- threatening to clog the immigration court system further with tens of thousands of similar claims per year and setting up a likely Supreme Court showdown.

Meanwhile, left-leaning legal groups repeatedly have brought big cases directly to the 9th Circuit during the Trump administration. Ben Feuer, one of the top appellate litigators in California and chairman of the California Appellate Law Group, told Fox News that progressives are unlikely to look to other circuits now that the 9th Circuit is turning more conservative.

""Aside from the 9th Circuit, only the Second and Eleventh Circuits currently have a majority of Democratic appointees (the Tenth is tied),"" Feuer said. ""The Second Circuit is +5 Democratic by my count and the Eleventh is +2 Democratic. Those aren't very significant differentials -- certainly not on par with the Ninth Circuit of yore.""

WATCH: FEINSTEIN FUMES AS TRUMP ADMIN PLOWS AHEAD WITH 9TH CIRCUIT NOMINATIONS WITHOUT CONSULTING HER

Feuer added: ""Now, if the trend continues, that could certainly change, but I don't know that filing suit with left-leaning outcome goals in New York or Miami is very likely to get a much different result than in San Francisco, Los Angeles, or Seattle. Also, many of the more progressive state statutes being enacted are coming from the experimental West Coast cities and states, so those have to be litigated in the Ninth Circuit anyway.""

In televised remarks last Thursday, Feinstein warned that a future Democratic administration would immediately move to load the 9th Circuit with more liberal justices, given the Trump administration's no-compromise approach. But, Feuer said, that may not be entirely within Democrats' control.

Orchestrated offensive?

Taken together, the Dowd and Trump comments had the feel of an orchestrated offensive to repair the damage wrought over the weekend, to discredit Mueller's findings ahead of time and to offer ammunition for pro-Trump media.

Trump's broadside against the FBI has prompted some talk about why the bureau's new director, Christopher Wray, who was nominated by the President to replace Comey, has not stepped up to publicly defend his agents.

Wray told his staff in an agency-wide email Monday that the bureau should be prepared for scrutiny.

Legal argument

The idea that a President cannot obstruct justice may be a workable legal argument to contend with any future criminal action against Trump. Legal scholars have yet to resolve a constitutional dispute over whether a sitting president can be indicted. But it may not protect the President politically.

Similarly, the articles of impeachment against Bill Clinton included an accusation that he had ""prevented, obstructed, and impeded the administration of justice.""

""That is an ignorant and arrogant assertion,"" he said.

justice,Washington Times,2,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/sep/24/rod-rosenstein-has-resigned-deputy-attorney-genera/,Rod Rosenstein is out as Deputy Attorney General,2018-09-24,Jeff Mordock,"Rod Rosenstein remains the No . 2 man at the Justice Department , but now faces a major meeting later this week with President Trump to hash out his future .
News reports that Mr. Rosenstein had resigned or was fired Monday turned out not to be true .
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Mr. Trump does want to have a face-to-face meeting with his deputy attorney general to talk about allegations Mr. Rosenstein talked about secretly taping the president , and suggested invoking the 25th Amendment to oust the president from office .
Mr. Rosenstein on Monday did have a previously scheduled meeting with White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly . As Mr. Rosenstein departed a White House meeting , Mr. Kelly took the unusual step of giving the smiling Mr. Rosenstein an enthusiastic goodbye handshake on the driveway in full view of television cameras , as if to convey that their discussion was amicable .
In New York for a meeting at the United Nations , Mr. Trump confirmed that he spoke with Mr. Rosenstein on Monday and he still has his job at the Justice Department . When asked if he was firing Mr. Rosenstein , the president responded , “ no , ” adding that the pair will have a meeting on Thursday .
“ We ’ ll be meeting at the White House and we will be determining what ’ s going on , ” Mr. Trump said . “ We want to have transparency . We want to have openness and I look forward to meeting with Rod at that time . ”
Mr. Rosenstein has denied suggesting removing the president , though a department official told The New York Times he did — sarcastically — mention taping Mr. Trump .
The explanations and denials have done little to stop calls from conservatives for Mr. Rosenstein to step down or be fired if he ’ s been undermining the president .
“ If Rosenstein is involved , he should be fired , ” said Sen. Lindsey Graham , South Carolina Republican . “ There ’ s a bureaucratic coup at the Department of Justice and FBI , and somebody needs to look at it . ”
Democrats warned against any moves to oust the deputy attorney general , who is overseeing special counsel ’ s Robert Mueller ’ s probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election .
“ Under no circumstances should Rod Rosenstein resign , ” tweeted Rep. Adam Schiff , the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee . “ This would place the Mueller investigation in even greater jeopardy . Rosenstein should continue to do his job , protect the independence of the DOJ , and if the president intends to obstruct justice , force Trump to fire him . ”
Other Democrats said it doesn ’ t matter whether Mr. Rosenstein is fired or resigns — either would be a hindrance to the Mueller probe .
Rep. Elijah Cummings , the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee , said his panel must be ready to hold a hearing to get evidence from Mr. Rosenstein .
“ Mr . Rosenstein ’ s removal would plunge our nation into uncharted territory and pose a serious and profound threat to the continued work of the special counsel , and I would expect the American people to be outraged if President Trump ’ s extended campaign to interfere with this investigation results in Mr. Rosenstein ’ s ouster , ” he said .
Conservative lawmakers said The New York Times report underscores the need for Mr. Trump to declassify Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act records related to former campaign official Carter Page . Mr. Trump was set to release the documents despite Justice Department concerns they will have a negative impact on the Mueller probe . He backed off releasing everything last week .

News reports that Mr. Rosenstein had resigned or was fired Monday turned out not to be true.

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Mr. Trump does want to have a face-to-face meeting with his deputy attorney general to talk about allegations Mr. Rosenstein talked about secretly taping the president, and suggested invoking the 25th Amendment to oust the president from office.

Mr. Rosenstein on Monday did have a previously scheduled meeting with White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly. As Mr. Rosenstein departed a White House meeting, Mr. Kelly took the unusual step of giving the smiling Mr. Rosenstein an enthusiastic goodbye handshake on the driveway in full view of television cameras, as if to convey that their discussion was amicable.

In New York for a meeting at the United Nations, Mr. Trump confirmed that he spoke with Mr. Rosenstein on Monday and he still has his job at the Justice Department. When asked if he was firing Mr. Rosenstein, the president responded, “no,” adding that the pair will have a meeting on Thursday.

“We’ll be meeting at the White House and we will be determining what’s going on,” Mr. Trump said. “We want to have transparency. We want to have openness and I look forward to meeting with Rod at that time.”

Mr. Rosenstein has denied suggesting removing the president, though a department official told The New York Times he did — sarcastically — mention taping Mr. Trump.

The explanations and denials have done little to stop calls from conservatives for Mr. Rosenstein to step down or be fired if he’s been undermining the president.

“If Rosenstein is involved, he should be fired,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican. “There’s a bureaucratic coup at the Department of Justice and FBI, and somebody needs to look at it.”

Democrats warned against any moves to oust the deputy attorney general, who is overseeing special counsel’s Robert Mueller’s probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.

“Under no circumstances should Rod Rosenstein resign,” tweeted Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee. “This would place the Mueller investigation in even greater jeopardy. Rosenstein should continue to do his job, protect the independence of the DOJ, and if the president intends to obstruct justice, force Trump to fire him.”

Other Democrats said it doesn’t matter whether Mr. Rosenstein is fired or resigns — either would be a hindrance to the Mueller probe.

Rep. Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said his panel must be ready to hold a hearing to get evidence from Mr. Rosenstein.

“Mr. Rosenstein’s removal would plunge our nation into uncharted territory and pose a serious and profound threat to the continued work of the special counsel, and I would expect the American people to be outraged if President Trump’s extended campaign to interfere with this investigation results in Mr. Rosenstein’s ouster,” he said.

Conservative lawmakers said The New York Times report underscores the need for Mr. Trump to declassify Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act records related to former campaign official Carter Page. Mr. Trump was set to release the documents despite Justice Department concerns they will have a negative impact on the Mueller probe. He backed off releasing everything last week.

“The latest reports on Rod Rosenstein underscore the desperate need for transparency at the DOJ,” tweeted Rep. Mark Meadows, North Carolina Republican. “Release the documents. Declassify everything. Stop the games and show Americans the truth about this Russia investigation.”

Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the investigation into Russian meddling, leaving Mr. Rosenstein in charge of the investigation.

Should Mr. Rosenstein go, the next in line would be the No. 3 spot at the Justice Department, but it’s been vacant since Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand resigned earlier this year.

Under the Justice Department’s succession plan, Solicitor General Noel Francisco would be next in line.

But some analysts say he might not be the best choice. Mr. Francisco has said little about the special counsel investigation, but has suggested federal political corruption investigations have overreached.

He also accused former FBI Director James B. Comey of using “kid gloves” in the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state.

""We see a highly emotional atmosphere,"" Peskov said, according to state-run Tass media. ""But before making any evaluations, we should wait for everyone to calm down and the situation to stabilize.""",www.npr.org,center,lOc3zyHqEaPtJFkx

A remarkable attack

By Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington

Donald Trump no longer likes Jeff Sessions, one of his earliest, most prominent supporters. This is not news. There are also political reasons why the president has been unwilling to straight-up fire his attorney general. This is also not news.

That Mr Trump went so far as to say he doesn't have an attorney general - a slightly tamer version of ""he's dead to me"" - is dramatic, but it's variations on a theme.

What might be surprising, and might also be significant, is the president's decision to criticise Mr Sessions for more than just his recusal from the Russia probe. He doesn't like the way he's handling the immigration issue, for instance.

Given that Mr Sessions was considered to be one of the hardest of the hard-liners on immigration while in the US Senate and the man who helped refine Mr Trump's anti-immigration strategy during the campaign, this is remarkable.

It could also possibly be the beginning of the president's efforts to make a larger case for getting rid of Mr Sessions - after the mid-term elections removes the possibility of immediate political fallout, of course.

If the president can frame axing Mr Sessions as part of a larger political disagreement, that could help deflect some of the intense criticism he will receive for the move.

It's still going to be a rough ride, and confirming a replacement for the attorney general in the Senate will be a monumental task, but the pieces are being moved on the board.

Deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein remains in his job, after reports on Monday said he had resigned or offered to do so.

The White House said Donald Trump and Rosenstein had “an extended conversation” about news stories published last week reporting that Rosenstein discussed with colleagues secretly recording Trump or having him removed from office.

The two plan to meet on Thursday, after the president’s return from a United Nations general assembly meeting in New York, press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement. Sanders said the meeting was at Rosenstein’s request.

The White House did not comment on reports Rosenstein expected to be fired imminently or had resigned.

The deputy attorney general oversees the investigation of Russian election interference and links between the Trump campaign and Moscow.

The New York Times reported last week that he discussed secretly recording the president and invoking the 25th amendment to remove Trump from office. Rosenstein said the report was “inaccurate”.

Trump and 'collusion': what we know so far about Mueller's Russia investigation Read more

Rosenstein was overseeing Mueller’s work after the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, recused himself due to his contacts with Russian officials when he was part of the Trump campaign. Trump has repeatedly attacked Sessions for that move.

In overseeing the special counsel, Rosenstein is responsible for approving major new directions in the investigation, for signing off on the budget and for meeting regularly with Mueller to assess the investigation’s progress.

For more than a year, Trump has railed against the Russia investigation, calling it a “witch hunt” and accusing the prosecutors involved – many of whom, like Rosenstein and Mueller, are Republicans – of harboring ulterior partisan motives.

Trump’s relationship with Rosenstein has been vexed. The president has tweeted that Rosenstein is “weak” but in August he also said the relationship was “fantastic”.

Frustration moved in both directions, with Rosenstein reportedly growing “angry” at Trump in May 2017, after Trump used a memo written by Rosenstein to justify the firing of FBI director James Comey. It was in the sensitive aftermath of that firing that Rosenstein suggested recording the president, the Times reported.

One source told the Times Rosenstein had suggested recording the president “sarcastically”’; others said he was serious.

Sources for the Times report included people familiar with memos kept by former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe about his conversations with Rosenstein. McCabe was fired by Trump in March, days before he was due to retire.

Adler, Ilya Somin, Stewart Baker, Scott Shackford, Josh Blackman, Eric Boehm, Damon Root, Zuri Davis, C.J. Ciaramella","Derek Chauvin , the former Minneapolis police officer who was arrested on Friday in connection with the death of George Floyd , faces two charges as a result of that incident : third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter . Floyd 's family argues that Chauvin should have been charged with first-degree murder . The distinction hinges on Chauvin 's state of mind as he pinned Floyd to the ground with a knee on his neck , which he continued to do even as Floyd complained that he could not breathe , even after Floyd stopped speaking or moving , and even after another officer reported that he could not detect a pulse .
The May 25 incident , which sparked protests across the country , began when someone called 911 to report that a man had used a counterfeit $ 20 bill for a purchase at Cup Foods , a restaurant on Chicago Avenue . Shortly after 8 p.m. , Officers Thomas Lane and J.A . Kueng arrived at the restaurant , where employees reported that the customer who had made the purchase was sitting in a car parked nearby on 38th Street . Lane and Kueng found Floyd sitting in the driver 's seat and ordered him , then pulled him , out of the car . According to the criminal complaint against Chauvin , which is based largely on body camera video of the incident , Floyd `` actively resisted being handcuffed '' but `` once handcuffed…became compliant and walked with Officer Lane to the sidewalk and sat on the ground at Officer Lane 's direction . ''
The complaint says Lane asked for Floyd 's name and identification , asked if he was `` on anything , '' and informed him that he was under arrest for passing a counterfeit bill , a misdemeanor when the offense involves merchandise worth no more than $ 1,000 . When Lane and Kueng stood Floyd up and tried to walk him toward their squad car , the complaint says , he `` stiffened up , fell to the ground , and told the officers he was claustrophobic . '' At this point Chauvin and Officer Tou Thoa arrived at the scene in a separate squad car .
According to the complaint , the officers repeatedly tried to get Floyd into Lane and Kueng 's car . The complaint says Floyd `` did not voluntarily get in the car and struggled with the officers by intentionally falling down , saying he was not going in the car , and refusing to stand still . '' While standing outside the car , Floyd `` began saying and repeating that he could not breathe . '' About five minutes after Lane and Kueng intially tried to put Floyd in their car , Chauvin pulled Floyd `` out of the passenger side of the squad car . '' Floyd `` went to the ground face down and still handcuffed . '' As Kueng held Floyd 's back and Lane held his legs , Chauvin `` placed his left knee in the area of Mr. Floyd 's head and neck . ''
Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd 's neck for nearly nine minutes . `` I ca n't breathe , '' Floyd repeatedly said . `` Please , '' he pleaded more than once . `` Mama , '' he cried out . CNN legal analyst Elie Honig , a former state and federal prosecutor , notes that Floyd also can be heard saying `` do n't kill me '' and `` I 'm about to die '' in video of the incident , although the complaint omits those statements . It also does not mention that bystanders , worried about Floyd , urged the officers to get off of him .
Chauvin and the other two officers nevertheless `` stayed in their positions , '' although Lane twice suggested that they roll Floyd off his stomach and onto his side . `` I am worried about excited delirium or whatever , '' Lane said at one point . Chauvin rejected Lane 's suggestions .
About five minutes after the officers pinned Floyd to the ground , he stopped moving . A minute later , `` the video appears to show Mr. Floyd ceasing to breathe or speak . '' Kueng checked Floyd 's right wrist for a pulse and said , `` I could n't find one . '' Still , `` none of the officers moved from their positions . '' About two minutes later , Chauvin finally removed his knee from Floyd 's neck . An ambulance arrived and took Floyd to the Hennepin County Medical Center , where he was pronounced dead .
The third-degree murder charge against Chauvin , which is punishable by up to 25 years in prison , alleges that he caused Floyd 's death by `` perpetrating an act eminently dangerous to others and evincing a depraved mind , without regard for human life , '' but `` without intent to effect the death of any person . '' The lesser charge of second-degree manslaughter , which is punishable by up to 10 years in prison , alleges that Chauvin killed Floyd through `` culpable negligence '' that created `` an unreasonable risk '' of `` death or great bodily harm . ''
Both of those charges seem well-supported by the facts revealed in the video . What about first-degree murder , the charge that Benjamin Crump , the attorney representing Floyd 's family , thinks should have been brought ? That charge , which carries a mandatory life sentence , requires that Chauvin acted `` with premeditation '' and `` with intent '' to kill Floyd . `` We now have the audio from the police body cam , and we hear where one officer says , 'He does n't have a pulse , maybe we should turn him on his side , ' '' Crump said today on Face the Nation . `` But yet , Officer Chauvin says , 'No , we 're going to keep him in this position . ' That 's intent . ''
That claim seems plausible given the repeated pleas from Floyd , the repeated exhortations by witnesses , and Lane 's repeated suggestions that Floyd should not be left on his stomach—any of which , if heeded , could have prevented Floyd 's death . But do Chauvin 's actions suggest `` premeditation '' ? That element does not require a carefully laid plan to kill someone , but it does mean that the defendant `` consider [ ed ] , plan [ ned ] or prepare [ d ] for , or determine [ d ] to commit , the act…prior to its commission .

Second-degree murder , which is punishable by up to 40 years in prison , seems like a better fit .

Some of the details in the complaint could be useful to the officers ' lawyers . The complaint claims that Floyd was uncooperative and that he began complaining about difficulty breathing even before he was pinned to the ground , which might have led the officers to discount his subsequent complaints . `` You are talking fine , '' one of them said while Floyd was still moving .
The report also notes—gratuitously , in Honig 's view—that Floyd was `` over six feet tall and weigh [ ed ] more than 200 pounds . '' While that information might be relevant in understanding why the officers had trouble getting Floyd into the patrol car , it has no real bearing on what they did once they had him pinned . In particular , it does not explain Chauvin 's decision to keep kneeling on Floyd 's neck .
Honig also faults the prosecutors ' description of what caused Floyd 's death , which is based on preliminary autopsy results . `` The autopsy revealed no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation , '' the complaint says . `` Mr. Floyd had underlying health conditions including coronary artery disease and hypertensive heart disease . The combined effects of Mr. Floyd being restrained by the police , his underlying health conditions and any potential intoxicants in his system likely contributed to his death . ''
Honig notes that `` the lack of 'physical findings ' by no means rules out the possibility that the victim died of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation . '' And he questions the reference to intoxication as a factor that may have contributed to Floyd 's death . `` In my 14 years as a prosecutor ( or my 45 years of life ) , I 've never heard of a 'potential intoxicant , ' '' he writes . `` Did Floyd have intoxicants in his system or not ? A basic toxicology test should answer that question conclusively , and there is no excuse for prosecutors to not know the answer , or to state it ambiguously , four days after Floyd 's death . ''
Contrary to Honig 's assertion , toxicology results often are not available for weeks after an autopsy . At this point , the speculation that Floyd was under the influence of a drug seems to be based on little more than the officers ' suspicions . In any event , as Honig points out , that question is irrelevant to Chauvin 's culpability . Regardless of Floyd 's preexisting medical conditions or any drug he may or may not have taken , the relevant question in the causal analysis is whether he would still be alive but for Chauvin 's actions , and the answer to that seems clear .
Addendum : Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe and Minnesota attorney Albert Turner Goins , writing in The Boston Globe , argue that the third-degree murder charge against Chauvin is inappropriate because case law limits that charge to `` reckless or wanton acts…without special regard to their effect on any particular person , '' such as `` shooting aimlessly into a crowd . '' They say a second-degree murder charge , under a provision dealing with a defendant who causes someone 's death `` while committing or attempting to commit a felony offense '' ( in this case , the assault on Floyd ) makes more sense . That provision does not require proof of an intent to kill .","Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who was arrested on Friday in connection with the death of George Floyd, faces two charges as a result of that incident: third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Floyd's family argues that Chauvin should have been charged with first-degree murder. The distinction hinges on Chauvin's state of mind as he pinned Floyd to the ground with a knee on his neck, which he continued to do even as Floyd complained that he could not breathe, even after Floyd stopped speaking or moving, and even after another officer reported that he could not detect a pulse.

The May 25 incident, which sparked protests across the country, began when someone called 911 to report that a man had used a counterfeit $20 bill for a purchase at Cup Foods, a restaurant on Chicago Avenue. Shortly after 8 p.m., Officers Thomas Lane and J.A. Kueng arrived at the restaurant, where employees reported that the customer who had made the purchase was sitting in a car parked nearby on 38th Street. Lane and Kueng found Floyd sitting in the driver's seat and ordered him, then pulled him, out of the car. According to the criminal complaint against Chauvin, which is based largely on body camera video of the incident, Floyd ""actively resisted being handcuffed"" but ""once handcuffed…became compliant and walked with Officer Lane to the sidewalk and sat on the ground at Officer Lane's direction.""

The complaint says Lane asked for Floyd's name and identification, asked if he was ""on anything,"" and informed him that he was under arrest for passing a counterfeit bill, a misdemeanor when the offense involves merchandise worth no more than $1,000. When Lane and Kueng stood Floyd up and tried to walk him toward their squad car, the complaint says, he ""stiffened up, fell to the ground, and told the officers he was claustrophobic."" At this point Chauvin and Officer Tou Thoa arrived at the scene in a separate squad car.

According to the complaint, the officers repeatedly tried to get Floyd into Lane and Kueng's car. The complaint says Floyd ""did not voluntarily get in the car and struggled with the officers by intentionally falling down, saying he was not going in the car, and refusing to stand still."" While standing outside the car, Floyd ""began saying and repeating that he could not breathe."" About five minutes after Lane and Kueng intially tried to put Floyd in their car, Chauvin pulled Floyd ""out of the passenger side of the squad car."" Floyd ""went to the ground face down and still handcuffed."" As Kueng held Floyd's back and Lane held his legs, Chauvin ""placed his left knee in the area of Mr. Floyd's head and neck.""

Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes. ""I can't breathe,"" Floyd repeatedly said. ""Please,"" he pleaded more than once. ""Mama,"" he cried out. CNN legal analyst Elie Honig, a former state and federal prosecutor, notes that Floyd also can be heard saying ""don't kill me"" and ""I'm about to die"" in video of the incident, although the complaint omits those statements. It also does not mention that bystanders, worried about Floyd, urged the officers to get off of him.

Chauvin and the other two officers nevertheless ""stayed in their positions,"" although Lane twice suggested that they roll Floyd off his stomach and onto his side. ""I am worried about excited delirium or whatever,"" Lane said at one point. Chauvin rejected Lane's suggestions.

About five minutes after the officers pinned Floyd to the ground, he stopped moving. A minute later, ""the video appears to show Mr. Floyd ceasing to breathe or speak."" Kueng checked Floyd's right wrist for a pulse and said, ""I couldn't find one."" Still, ""none of the officers moved from their positions."" About two minutes later, Chauvin finally removed his knee from Floyd's neck. An ambulance arrived and took Floyd to the Hennepin County Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead.

The third-degree murder charge against Chauvin, which is punishable by up to 25 years in prison, alleges that he caused Floyd's death by ""perpetrating an act eminently dangerous to others and evincing a depraved mind, without regard for human life,"" but ""without intent to effect the death of any person."" The lesser charge of second-degree manslaughter, which is punishable by up to 10 years in prison, alleges that Chauvin killed Floyd through ""culpable negligence"" that created ""an unreasonable risk"" of ""death or great bodily harm.""

What about first-degree murder, the charge that Benjamin Crump, the attorney representing Floyd's family, thinks should have been brought?

""The defendant had his knee on Mr. Floyd's neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds in total,"" the criminal complaint notes. ""Two minutes and 53 seconds of this was after Mr. Floyd was non-responsive. Police are trained that this type of restraint with a

subject in a prone position is inherently dangerous.""

Some of the details in the complaint could be useful to the officers' lawyers. The complaint claims that Floyd was uncooperative and that he began complaining about difficulty breathing even before he was pinned to the ground, which might have led the officers to discount his subsequent complaints. ""You are talking fine,"" one of them said while Floyd was still moving.

So New York will make its own : Gov . Andrew Cuomo announced Monday that as part of a response to the coronavirus oubreak , the state will distribute floral-perfumed “ NYS Clean ” sanitizer to schools and government agencies .
The catch ? The new hand sanitizer is produced by people in prison who earn pennies per hour . Because of their poor access to hand-cleaning supplies , these workers face a higher risk of infection from the virus—and it ’ s not even clear that they themselves will be able to use the sanitizer . At most prisons across the country , inmates aren ’ t allowed to use hand sanitizer because its alcohol content means it ’ s considered contraband . In some prisons , soap is in short supply . Combine that with the cramped quarters and spotty medical care in many lockups , and you have the perfect breeding ground for infections .

Andrew Cuomo announces state hand sanitizer— '' made , conveniently , by the state of New York '' —that will be provided to schools , MTA , prisons and more . `` It has a very nice floral bouquet .

At least 142 people in New York have tested positive for COVID-19 , the disease caused by the new coronavirus . Public health officials have recommended that people wash their hands regularly or use a hand sanitizer with at least a 60 percent alcohol content to try to slow the outbreak . Gov . Cuomo boasted that the inmate-made NYS Clean hand sanitizer is 75 percent alcohol . It ’ s produced by CorCraft , the state ’ s prison-run business , which paid incarcerated workers an average of 65 cents an hour in 2016 , according to a Gothamist report . ( New York hasn ’ t increased prisoner pay in 25 years . )

Andrew Cuomo announced Monday that as part of a response to the coronavirus oubreak, the state will distribute floral-perfumed “NYS Clean” sanitizer to schools and government agencies.

The catch? The new hand sanitizer is produced by people in prison who earn pennies per hour. Because of their poor access to hand-cleaning supplies, these workers face a higher risk of infection from the virus—and it’s not even clear that they themselves will be able to use the sanitizer. At most prisons across the country, inmates aren’t allowed to use hand sanitizer because its alcohol content means it’s considered contraband. In some prisons, soap is in short supply. Combine that with the cramped quarters and spotty medical care in many lockups, and you have the perfect breeding ground for infections.

NEW: Amid coronavirus outbreak, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announces state hand sanitizer—""made, conveniently, by the state of New York""—that will be provided to schools, MTA, prisons and more.

At least 142 people in New York have tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. Public health officials have recommended that people wash their hands regularly or use a hand sanitizer with at least a 60 percent alcohol content to try to slow the outbreak. Gov. Cuomo boasted that the inmate-made NYS Clean hand sanitizer is 75 percent alcohol. It’s produced by CorCraft, the state’s prison-run business, which paid incarcerated workers an average of 65 cents an hour in 2016, according to a Gothamist report. (New York hasn’t increased prisoner pay in 25 years.)

In his announcement, Cuomo said the product would be distributed to schools, government agencies, the MTA, and prisons. But just last year, a directive from the state corrections department specified that incarcerated people could not receive packages in the mail with any toiletries that contained alcohol, such as hand sanitizer—presumably because it was contraband.

After a jury found the Minnesota police officer who killed Philando Castile not guilty on Friday, Castile's mother Valerie pushed back against the decision.

""People have died for us to have these rights and now we're devolving. We're going back down to 1969. Damn. What is it going to take? I'm mad as hell right now, yes I am,"" she said.

Valerie Castile defended her son, who was killed in July, saying he would never jeopardize someone's life, especially with his girlfriend and her child in the car at the time. Philando Castile was killed during a traffic stop, and his girlfriend live streamed the moments after on Facebook Live.

Later Friday, thousands of people gathered on the steps of the state Capitol in St. Paul, holding signs and banners and chanting in response to the not guilty verdict.

After the hourlong rally, protesters took to the streets. Saint Paul Police escorted the crowd, which they estimated to be about 2,000 people.

The protest was peaceful, but a smaller group splintered off and walked down an entrance ramp to block Interstate 94, quickly snarling traffic and leading to the freeway’s shutdown in both directions, The Associated Press reported.

Jeronimo Yanez was cleared of a manslaughter charge as well as two lesser charges. After the verdict was read, Valerie Castile yelled an expletive and family and friends left the courtroom in tears.

justice,The Daily Caller,2,https://dailycaller.com/2019/11/07/mental-health-services-separated-migrants/,Obama Judge Rules Trump Admin Must Provide Mental Health Services To Separated Migrant Families,2019-11-07,,"A federal judge has ruled that the U.S. government must provide mental health services to the thousands of migrant parents and children who were separated at the southern border .
In a ruling late Tuesday , Judge John Kronstadt of the United States District Court in Los Angeles found the Trump administration responsible for the mental trauma caused by separating illegal alien families , according to a report from the New York Times . Kronstadt issued a preliminary injunction , ordering the administration to make available mental health services for those who experienced forced separation .
Psychological counseling and mental health screenings are among the services that must be provided by the Trump administration . These services — likely to be provided for a long period of time — are expected to be an expensive undertaking by the government , given the large number of illegal aliens who were subjected to separation .
“ This is truly groundbreaking , ” the dean of the University of California Berkeley School of Law , Erwin Chemerinsky , said to the Times about the ruling . “ The court is recognizing that when a government creates a danger that inflicts trauma , the government is responsible for providing a solution . It is not something I have seen a court do before . ”
The ruling was brought on by a class action lawsuit by three refugee mothers who were separated from their children upon their arrival at the U.S.-Mexico border .
Kronstadt ’ s preliminary injunction also marks the latest development since the Trump administration introduced , and then quickly ended , its most controversial immigration enforcement policy .
Faced with a rising number of illegal aliens appearing before the U.S.-Mexico border , then-Attorney General Sessions introduced a “ zero tolerance ” policy in April 2018 , which directed attorneys at the southern border to dramatically increase its prosecution of illegal border crossers .

Nevertheless , the White House is expected to appeal the latest ruling .","A federal judge has ruled that the U.S. government must provide mental health services to the thousands of migrant parents and children who were separated at the southern border.

In a ruling late Tuesday, Judge John Kronstadt of the United States District Court in Los Angeles found the Trump administration responsible for the mental trauma caused by separating illegal alien families, according to a report from the New York Times. Kronstadt issued a preliminary injunction, ordering the administration to make available mental health services for those who experienced forced separation.

Psychological counseling and mental health screenings are among the services that must be provided by the Trump administration. These services — likely to be provided for a long period of time — are expected to be an expensive undertaking by the government, given the large number of illegal aliens who were subjected to separation.

“This is truly groundbreaking,” the dean of the University of California Berkeley School of Law, Erwin Chemerinsky, said to the Times about the ruling. “The court is recognizing that when a government creates a danger that inflicts trauma, the government is responsible for providing a solution. It is not something I have seen a court do before.”

The ruling was brought on by a class action lawsuit by three refugee mothers who were separated from their children upon their arrival at the U.S.-Mexico border.

Kronstadt’s preliminary injunction also marks the latest development since the Trump administration introduced, and then quickly ended, its most controversial immigration enforcement policy.

Faced with a rising number of illegal aliens appearing before the U.S.-Mexico border, then-Attorney General Sessions introduced a “zero tolerance” policy in April 2018, which directed attorneys at the southern border to dramatically increase its prosecution of illegal border crossers. As a result, criminal charges climbed dramatically as a higher number of migrant parents also faced prosecution.

However, a consequence to the “zero tolerance” measure was that more migrant families began to be separated as adults were placed into detention while their children were transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services. A massive media backlash ensued, prompting President Donald Trump to nix the policy by executive order in June 2018 by way of executive order.

Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar in June 2018 estimated that around 3,000 alien children were likely separated upon arrival at the U.S. southern border, a higher number than previously expected.

Kronstadt — who was nominated to his position by former President Barack Obama — ultimately found that the government can be deemed liable of “deliberate indifference” if they place individuals in dangerous situations. The decision marks the latest ruling against the administration’s immigration agenda at the hands of Obama-appointed judges, highlighting the influence of the judicial branch in the fight over immigration enforcement.

Comey once stood in Rosenstein ’ s shoes : He served as deputy attorney general from 2003 to 2005 . And Comey ’ s handling of the investigation into the CIA leak scandal that rocked the George W. Bush administration holds valuable lessons for the current inquiry into the Trump campaign ’ s ties to Russia .
There are strong similarities between the challenges facing Rosenstein and the ones that Comey previously encountered . Today , the possibility of political interference hangs over the investigation by Robert Mueller , a former FBI director selected by Rosenstein to serve as special counsel . Similar doubts swirled around Patrick Fitzgerald , a US attorney from Illinois whom Comey picked to investigate the CIA leak in 2003 .
Much to his credit , Comey recognized that regulations laid out by the prior attorney general , Janet Reno , failed to give the special counsel sufficient independence from higher-ranking officials at the Justice Department . So Comey implemented a more robust set of safeguards to shield his special prosecutor .
Rosenstein has thus far failed to follow Comey ’ s lead . That ’ s unfortunate , because it leaves Mueller ’ s investigation vulnerable to interference by political appointees . A few simple changes would raise the confidence of the American people that Mueller is free to follow the evidence where it leads .
Kenneth Starr ’ s excesses led to the creation of a not-so-independent special counsel
To understand the limits on Mueller ’ s independence , let ’ s rewind to the middle of 1999 , when then-Attorney General Reno put forth the regulations that now govern Mueller ’ s investigation . The context was the imminent demise of the independent counsel law . At the time , independent counsel Kenneth Starr ’ s investigation of the Clintons was about to enter its sixth year . What started as an inquiry into the Whitewater land deal had morphed into a probe of President Clinton ’ s extramarital affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky — and there was a widespread sense , especially but not exclusively among Democrats , that the independent counsel had gone too far .
Starr was indeed independent from the Justice Department in virtually every sense of the term . Under the independent counsel statute , the scope of his authority was determined by a three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit , and he had “ full power and independent authority to exercise all investigative and prosecutorial functions ” of the attorney general with respect to all aspects of the probe . Starr did not have to report to the attorney general or anyone else at the Justice Department , and the attorney general didn ’ t have veto power over Starr ’ s investigative and prosecutorial decisions . The attorney general could remove Starr for “ good cause , ” disability , or any condition that “ substantially ” impaired the performance of his duties , but apart from that , Starr was his own man .
The statute authorizing the appointment of independent counsels was set to expire at midnight on June 30 , 1999 , and there was little appetite for extending it . ( Starr himself agreed it should be allowed to lapse . ) But Attorney General Reno knew that it was important to have procedures in place for investigations of high-ranking administration officials . And so she issued a new set of rules creating the “ special counsel ” position — rules that govern the position today .
Under the Reno rules , the decision to appoint a special counsel is made by the attorney general ( or by the deputy attorney general when the attorney general is recused from the matter , as in the Trump situation ) . The special counsel must be a lawyer with relevant prosecutorial experience who has “ a reputation for integrity and impartial decision-making. ” Unlike the independent counsel , the scope of the special counsel ’ s authority is defined by the attorney general ( or the deputy in the event of a recusal ) rather than by a court . And whereas the independent counsel had all the investigative and prosecutorial powers of the attorney general , the special counsel has the more limited powers of a US attorney .
That last distinction turns out to be a big one . There are 93 US attorneys , all of whom report to Justice Department higher-ups . Under the Reno rules , the special counsel likewise reports to the attorney general ( or whomever is filling a recused attorney general ’ s shoes ) . The special counsel must abide by most of the Justice Department guidelines that apply to US attorneys . And if the special counsel violates those guidelines , he may be fired .
The Reno rules go on to state that the special counsel must follow specific Justice Department requirements known as the “ Urgent Reports ” procedures . Under those procedures , a US attorney — or here , the special counsel — must notify top Justice Department officials at least three days in advance of any “ major development ” in a case . “ Major developments ” include not only arrests and criminal charges but also any execution of a search warrant or interview with a significant witness that is “ likely to receive national media coverage or Congressional attention. ” The attorney general then has the opportunity to block the US attorney or special counsel from moving forward with the proposed action .
In ordinary investigations , these procedures help maintain an orderly chain of command and surprises for managers . In a potentially explosive investigation of White House officials , they could play a more pernicious role . They mean that top political appointees will get a heads-up at every step of the inquiry — and an opportunity to meddle with the special counsel ’ s work .
The Reno rules also state that before the start of each federal fiscal year ( October 1 ) , the special counsel must request reauthorization from the attorney general ( or in the event of a recusal , the deputy ) . The attorney general then decides whether the investigation should continue for another year and , if so , how much money the special counsel should have . The attorney general thus can bring the special counsel ’ s inquiry to a halt , or bleed it dry .
At the end of an investigation under the Reno rules , the special counsel submits a confidential report to the attorney general , who in turn must report to the chair and ranking member of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees . The attorney general must tell those lawmakers whether he blocked the special counsel from pursuing any investigative or prosecutorial step . But note that the lawmakers learn this only at the end of the special counsel ’ s tenure . The attorney general also decides what parts , if any , of the final confidential report should be made public .
James Comey came up with a better alternative to Janet Reno ’ s system
Before last week , the Reno rules had been invoked only once before — in September 1999 , when Reno named former Republican Sen. John Danforth to lead an inquiry into the deadly 1993 fire at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco , Texas . Danforth ’ s investigation ended in November 2000 with a report , which Reno released to the public , in which Danforth cleared federal officials of responsibility for the fire .
Pressure to appoint a second special counsel mounted in 2003 , when two senior Bush administration officials anonymously leaked the name of a CIA operative to a Washington Post columnist . The attorney general at the time , John Ashcroft , recused himself from the investigation , because he was viewed as being too close to the White House ; that left his deputy , James Comey , in charge .
Rather than following the Reno rules , Comey devised a new set of principles to govern the CIA leak investigation . He recognized that under the relevant statute , he could confer much broader authority on the special counsel than the Reno rules provided : No law prevented him from vesting the special counsel with additional independence . And so upon naming Fitzgerald , then the US attorney for the Northern District of Illinois , to pursue the probe , Comey delegated to Fitzgerald “ all the authority of the Attorney General ” with respect to the investigation . Comey explained at the time that unlike a special counsel under the Reno rules , Fitzgerald would have “ the power and authority to make whatever prosecutive judgments he believes are appropriate , without having to come back to me or anybody else at the Justice Department for approvals . ”
Fitzgerald ’ s inquiry ultimately led to the conviction of I. Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby , former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney , on charges of perjury , obstruction of justice , and making false statements to FBI investigators . Libby was sentenced to 30 months in prison , though President Bush later commuted Libby ’ s prison term . All in all , Fitzgerald ’ s probe lasted 45 months and cost taxpayers a relatively modest $ 2.58 million .
Fitzgerald ’ s investigation did not lack for controversy . From the left , David Corn argued in the Nation that was not truly independent because he remained the US attorney for the Northern District of Illinois ; Corn thought Comey should have named a lawyer from outside the Justice Department , just as Rosenstein has done in the current case .
Libby himself argued , conversely , that Fitzgerald was too independent . According to Libby , Fitzgerald ’ s broad powers made him a “ principal officer ” for purposes of the Constitution ’ s Appointments Clause — he was effectively serving as a proxy for the attorney general . If that were true , Fitzgerald would have to be appointed by the president rather than by Comey . But a federal district court rejected that argument , relying on a 1988 Supreme Court case holding that independent counsels did not have to be presidentially appointed .
Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein ’ s role remains a cause for grave concern
Fast forward to May 2017 . President Trump has removed Comey from the FBI directorship after asking Comey to end the bureau ’ s investigation of former aide Michael Flynn ’ s dealings with Russia . Attorney General Jeff Sessions has recused himself from the investigation into the Trump campaign ’ s Russia connections after misleading the Senate about his own meetings with the Russian ambassador . Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein has appointed Robert Mueller , the highly regarded former FBI chief , to serve as special counsel and to carry out the Russia inquiry that Comey started .
Rosenstein ’ s appointment of Mueller is a welcome development . Everything we know about Mueller makes us think that he won ’ t be a rubber stamp for the Trump administration . But Rosenstein ’ s decision to follow the Reno rules rather than the more robust protections created by Comey in the CIA leak case remains a cause for concern .
This is so for two reasons . First , Rosenstein has done little so far to demonstrate his independence from the president — indeed , his remarkably flimsy memo justifying the Comey firing suggests just the opposite . And recall that under the Reno rules , Mueller must tip off Rosenstein at least 72 hours before taking virtually any step of significance . That means Rosenstein can stop Mueller in his tracks at every step of the way — or , less confrontationally , alert the White House to impending developments in the case . It ’ s hard to conduct a solid investigation when someone so close to your target knows your every move well in advance .
Defenders of Rosenstein will respond that the deputy attorney general , who was a well-respected career prosecutor before his Trump administration stint , would never do anything to intentionally impede Mueller ’ s inquiry . That ’ s likely right , but it still shouldn ’ t assuage our concern about his role . There is a second , more significant , reason why Rosenstein ’ s oversight over the special counsel ’ s investigation remains problematic : Rosenstein himself is now a dramatis persona in the Russia affair .
Rosenstein ’ s letter appointing Mueller instructs the new special counsel to continue the FBI ’ s investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia , but also to investigate “ any matters that arose or may arise directly ” from the FBI ’ s inquiry . One of these matters is whether President Trump ’ s firing of Comey was an attempt to interfere with an FBI investigation — and thus constituted obstruction of justice .
And Rosenstein played an important role in President Trump ’ s firing of Comey . He is certainly a material witness in Mueller ’ s incipient inquiry . Though likely not a target of the probe , he is at the very least a subject — a fact he essentially acknowledged when briefing the House of Representative last week . For him to have veto power over Mueller ’ s every step puts the special counsel ’ s investigation under a cloud .
Ideally , Rosenstein would recuse himself from matters related to the Mueller inquiry , leaving the Justice Department ’ s No . 3 official , Rachel Brand , in charge of the probe . Department rules require recusal when an attorney is too close to individuals or organizations “ substantially involved in the conduct that is the subject of the investigation. ” That description fits Rosenstein .
But while the case for Rosenstein ’ s recusal is , I think , overwhelming , there are still other steps that Rosenstein ( or Brand , if Rosenstein steps out of the way ) can take to insulate the special counsel . And in doing so , Rosenstein can draw several lessons from Comey ’ s handling of the CIA leak inquiry .
First , Rosenstein ( or Brand ) should waive the Justice Department ’ s “ Urgent Reports ” requirement for Mueller . Mueller should have discretion as to whether and when he informs the deputy attorney general in advance of major investigative and prosecutorial steps . If Mueller thinks that giving advance notice might compromise his inquiry , he should have the power to hold his plans close to the vest .
Second , Rosenstein should promise that he will inform the chair and ranking member of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees immediately if and when he blocks Mueller from taking any investigative or prosecutorial step , rather than waiting until the end of Mueller ’ s tenure to do so . It does little good for Congress to learn years after the fact that the deputy attorney general interfered in the probe .
Third , Rosenstein should make clear — as Comey did in the CIA case — that the special counsel , not the deputy attorney general , will decide when the investigation will be over . Fitzgerald did not need Comey ’ s reauthorization every October 1 to press forward with his probe . Mueller , too , should have the authority to pursue his inquiry to its logical conclusion .
In the end , what matters most is that Robert Mueller can conduct his inquiry without political actors at the Justice Department casting a shadow on the process . James Comey recognized more than a decade ago that an unfettered investigation into the CIA leak required more insulation than the Reno rules provided . Mueller ’ s inquiry is , if anything , even more politically sensitive and more significant to the nation than the CIA leak probe . Let ’ s hope Rosenstein will realize that , once again , we deserve an investigation that ’ s truly independent .

Mike Rogers, the head of the National Security Agency and Richard Ledgett, Rogers’ departed deputy, all agreed to participate in interviews with Mueller’s investigators as early as this week, five anonymous sources briefed on the requestes told the Post.

It wasn’t immediately clear if others have been questioned by the FBI.

Investigators are also reportedly looking for proof of possible financial crimes committed by Trump associates.

“The FBI leak of information regarding the President is outrageous, inexcusable and illegal,” Mark Corallo, a spokesman for Trump’s personal attorney, Marc Kasowitz, said Wednesday.

Mueller’s office declined to comment.

The investigation into obstruction of justice into Trump reportedly started days after former FBI Director James Comey’s May 9 ouster.

According to the Post, a March 22 exchange among Trump, Coats, and CIA Director Mike Pompeo, alone in the White House, is of potential interest to Mueller. Coats reportedly said that Trump had asked him if he could intervene with Comey to get the FBI to back off focus on former national security adviser Michael Flynn as part of the Russia probe.",www.foxnews.com,right,ZhYR3RzdX8hOBmsP

On Sept. 21 , beat cops with the New York Police Department will start giving any person they stop , but do not end up arresting , an information card that will explain why he or she was stopped in the first place . The card – now being dubbed a “ receipt ” – will include the officer ’ s name and badge number , as well as information on how to make a complaint , if necessary .
Just a few years ago , New York ’ s famous mean streets included one of the most aggressive police departments in the nation . Police flooded high-crime neighborhoods , stopping and frisking hundreds of thousands of people each year – a proactive policing tactic meant to nip crime before it started .
But nearly 9 of 10 of those stopped were never arrested or charged with a crime , and the vast majority of those stopped – more than 85 percent – were black and Latino men . In 2013 , a federal judge ruled that the reasons given for many of these stops – such as walking in a “ high crime neighborhood ” or somehow exhibiting a “ furtive movement ” – hardly met the constitutional “ reasonable suspicion ” standard for searches .
The new receipt program represents a dramatic turnabout for the department . Most experts believe its is the first of its kind , and its timing is significant . With the Obama administration and policing theorists promoting “ community policing ” – getting beat cops to become more attuned with local neighborhoods – it could resonate beyond New York , if successful .
“ This is all over the literature now – police legitimacy , fairness in policing , ” says Edward Connors , president of the Institute for Law and Justice in Williamsburg , Va .
This new police procedure could help change the tone when citizens interact with police on the streets , he adds .
“ There ’ s no solid science behind it yet , but from the psychology field , it ’ s been a theory that ’ s been tested and has shown a lot of promise : that if you treat people fairly and give them an explanation – maybe they ’ re not happy , like in the case of someone who gets a traffic ticket – but they understand and they might feel that some justice has been done . ”
The federal case against the NYPD two years ago in many ways set the stage for the nationwide unrest and Black Lives Matter protest movement , which were sparked by the perception of aggressive policing in minority communities . After the deaths of black men such as Eric Garner in New York and Michael Brown in Ferguson in 2014 , many activists and experts have begun to scrutinize even the most basic police procedures .
“ Officers everywhere are expected to tell people they stop the purpose for the stop , ” says Darrel Stephens , executive director of Major Cities Chiefs , a professional association of police executives in Salt Lake City . And across the nation , he notes , “ departments are also working harder to ensure officers provide a clear statement of their reasonable suspicion to make the stop on the forms they use to document the encounter . ”
Under the administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio , the number of stop-and-frisks in New York City has fallen dramatically , to about 50,000 per year , down from a high of nearly 700,000 stops in 2011 . But again , nearly 8 out 10 are still not arrested or charged with a crime .
The new receipt program is being instituted by the department on the recommendation of the federal judge and the monitor appointed as a part of the federal case . For people stopped but not arrested , the receipt will explain `` What Is a Stop ? '' It describes the penal law giving the officer the authority to make a stop based on “ reasonable suspicion , ” and includes checkoff boxes that explain what the officer ’ s initial suspicion may have been . These include “ acting as a lookout , ” “ engaging in a drug transaction , ” or “ matches a specific suspect ’ s description , ” among others .
The receipt would also include the officer ’ s name , rank and shield number , as well as the numbers for the department ’ s internal affairs bureau and the city ’ s Citizens Complaint Review Board .
“ A tense moment is when a civilian says to a police officer , ‘ What is your badge number , ' ” Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams , a former police officer , told the local ABC affiliate in New York , noting that these stop receipts could eliminate that tension .
“ If you are an active cop in a high crime area and you 're doing your job and some bad guy wants to report you for doing your job , the police department has never held that against you , ” he said .
After the federal stop-and-frisk case , the de Blasio administration has also instituted a number of reforms , including pilot programs with body cameras , new community policing programs giving officers more time to walk their beats instead of answering 911 calls , and new training that emphasizes deescalating conflicts and clearer rules for the use of force .
But many of the rank and file of the NYPD still remain bitter at the 2013 court case , and the new receipt policy is being criticized by many police union leaders .
“ They are just one more item on the ever-growing list of anti-public-safety measures that will put an end to proactive policing in this city and ultimately accelerate the increase in crime and disorder that we are already seeing in our public spaces , ” said Patrick Lynch , head of the NYPD ’ s patrolman ’ s union , in a statement .
“ It is time for our policymakers to stop heaping new burdens on police officers and to figure out how unwind the damaging measures that are already in place before the erosion in public safety does serious damage to NYC 's economic health , ” he said .
Some experts counter that efforts like this , making police explain street encounters , could help reduce the tensions now engulfing many jurisdictions throughout the nation .
Mr. Connors at the Institute for Law and Justice suggests that the department take a sample of those stopped to measure how well it may be easing tensions on the streets . “ I think it ’ s a great possibility . ”","As police departments across the nation reevaluate their encounters with citizens on the streets in a post-Ferguson era, the country’s largest police force will begin giving “receipts” to those stopped, questioned, or frisked but then allowed to go on about their day.

The federal case against the NYPD two years ago in many ways set the stage for the nationwide unrest and Black Lives Matter protest movement, which were sparked by the perception of aggressive policing in minority communities. After the deaths of black men such as Eric Garner in New York and Michael Brown in Ferguson in 2014, many activists and experts have begun to scrutinize even the most basic police procedures.

“Officers everywhere are expected to tell people they stop the purpose for the stop,” says Darrel Stephens, executive director of Major Cities Chiefs, a professional association of police executives in Salt Lake City. And across the nation, he notes, “departments are also working harder to ensure officers provide a clear statement of their reasonable suspicion to make the stop on the forms they use to document the encounter.”

Under the administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio, the number of stop-and-frisks in New York City has fallen dramatically, to about 50,000 per year, down from a high of nearly 700,000 stops in 2011. But again, nearly 8 out 10 are still not arrested or charged with a crime.

The new receipt program is being instituted by the department on the recommendation of the federal judge and the monitor appointed as a part of the federal case. For people stopped but not arrested, the receipt will explain ""What Is a Stop?"" It describes the penal law giving the officer the authority to make a stop based on “reasonable suspicion,” and includes checkoff boxes that explain what the officer’s initial suspicion may have been. These include “acting as a lookout,” “engaging in a drug transaction,” or “matches a specific suspect’s description,” among others.

The receipt would also include the officer’s name, rank and shield number, as well as the numbers for the department’s internal affairs bureau and the city’s Citizens Complaint Review Board.

“A tense moment is when a civilian says to a police officer, ‘What is your badge number,' ” Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, a former police officer, told the local ABC affiliate in New York, noting that these stop receipts could eliminate that tension.

“If you are an active cop in a high crime area and you're doing your job and some bad guy wants to report you for doing your job, the police department has never held that against you,” he said.

After the federal stop-and-frisk case, the de Blasio administration has also instituted a number of reforms, including pilot programs with body cameras, new community policing programs giving officers more time to walk their beats instead of answering 911 calls, and new training that emphasizes deescalating conflicts and clearer rules for the use of force.

But many of the rank and file of the NYPD still remain bitter at the 2013 court case, and the new receipt policy is being criticized by many police union leaders.

“They are just one more item on the ever-growing list of anti-public-safety measures that will put an end to proactive policing in this city and ultimately accelerate the increase in crime and disorder that we are already seeing in our public spaces,” said Patrick Lynch, head of the NYPD’s patrolman’s union, in a statement.

“It is time for our policymakers to stop heaping new burdens on police officers and to figure out how unwind the damaging measures that are already in place before the erosion in public safety does serious damage to NYC's economic health,” he said.

Some experts counter that efforts like this, making police explain street encounters, could help reduce the tensions now engulfing many jurisdictions throughout the nation.

Mr. Connors at the Institute for Law and Justice suggests that the department take a sample of those stopped to measure how well it may be easing tensions on the streets. “I think it’s a great possibility.”",www.csmonitor.com,center,702K2oTlr3OgkkwD

The Senate this week is set to take up six of Trump’s nominees to the regional appeals courts, including four from states that have at least one Democratic senator.

A long-standing Senate tradition that gave senators clout over judicial nominees from their home states has been fraying for years, meaning Democrats have less of a chance of blocking appointees they oppose, as they did with some success during Republican former President George W. Bush’s administration.

One of those due for consideration on the Senate floor this week is Milwaukee lawyer Michael Brennan, who Trump has nominated for a vacant seat on the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which has jurisdiction over a region that includes Wisconsin.

Oregon’s two senators, both Democrats, oppose the nomination.

Brennan, Bounds and other Trump nominees who may be opposed by home-state Democratic senators are likely to win confirmation because of the Republicans’ 51-49 Senate majority.

Trump has made quick progress in reshaping federal appeals courts, winning Senate confirmation of 15 nominees to fill vacancies on federal appeals courts. Trump’s Democratic predecessor Barack Obama won confirmation of nine appeals court judges by the same point in his first term.

Trump also has been picking a raft of conservative jurists for lower federal courts and won Senate confirmation last year of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch.

The regional appeals courts play a major role in shaping U.S. law. The judges hear appeals from federal district courts and usually have the final say, as the U.S. Supreme Court takes up only a tiny proportion of cases.

The appeals courts can set binding precedents on a broad array of issues, including voting rights, gun rights and other divisive social issues.

WORTHWHILE PRICE

For Trump and his party, setting aside a long-standing Senate tradition may be a worthwhile price to pay to achieve what Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has called a top goal: shifting the ideological composition of the federal judiciary to the right.

For Trump, nine of the 15 appeals court vacancies he has filled have been on regional courts that already leaned conservative. His administration now aims to fill vacancies in regional courts from states represented by Democratic senators.

Leonard Leo, an outside advisor to Trump who has been instrumental on judicial nominations including Gorsuch’s, said the White House has the same criteria for picking conservative nominees no matter the state.

But Leo said, “You’ve got to engage a little more - in a more intense degree of consultation - with Democrats than with Republicans, so that takes a little time.”

The White House did not respond to requests for comment.

Some nominations have been less contentious, with the White House and Democratic senators able to agree.

Michael Scudder and Amy St. Eve, two Trump nominees for the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, are backed by the two Illinois senators, both Democrats. They are among the nominees up for Senate confirmation votes this week.

Hawaii’s two Democratic senators back a Trump nominee to the 9th Circuit.

( Bria Webb/REUTERS )
As the tragic death of Willie McCoy showed , what cops do in the moments before drawing their weapons can make all the difference .
Last last week , the Vallejo , Calif. , police department released several minutes of body-cam footage showing the controversial police shooting of a young black man named Willie McCoy . McCoy had apparently fallen asleep in the drive-thru line at a Taco Bell with a gun in his lap . Police were called when he didn ’ t respond to horn honks or taps on his windows . A few minutes later , he was dead .
After watching the video , I believe McCoy ’ s death was likely the moment the cops arrived and saw his gun , and it became likely in large part because of the way the police handled the encounter . Moreover , this incident helped illustrate why police kill too many Americans : Their poor tactics and unwise choices place burdens on troubled , impaired , or confused civilians that can make tragedy inevitable .
First , let ’ s break down what happened to McCoy . You can watch the entire , rather disturbing video here , with helpful analysis from a cop-friendly perspective [ WARNING : DISTURBING CONTENT AHEAD ] :
I wanted to link to the more pro-cop video analysis for a reason : It very clearly shows the potential danger presented by a sleeping man with a gun in his lap , especially when that man starts to move .

When the police arrive , they find McCoy fast asleep — so asleep and unresponsive that he seems closer to unconsciousness . In spite of the fact that they know that he has a gun ( in the moment they think the magazine is halfway out of the gun and believe he has at most one shot , a potential round in the chamber ) , the officers cluster right by him , clearly in his sight line should he wake up .

Think back to the plans the officers considered before McCoy starts moving . Both of them involve dramatically startling an armed , sleeping man while he has a gun in his lap . I could understand that kind of jarring action if the man was currently a threat to himself or others , but he was asleep . His chief offense was blocking customers from accessing tacos .
Of course a man should not fall asleep in a Taco Bell drive-thru . It ’ s even more unnerving when he does so with a gun in plain view in his lap . But it ’ s odd for officers to simultaneously declare that they felt in mortal danger while also placing themselves directly in the suspect ’ s potential line of fire , considering drastic action as he continued to sleep , and then responding to his substantial movements with a cavalcade of startling shouts that he had three seconds to properly process ( from an unconscious sleep ) before he was shredded by bullets . Why did officers place themselves in such a vulnerable position ? Why did they ponder such dramatic measures to wake a sleeping , armed man ?
The department claims the officers fired in “ fear for their own safety. ” Well , yes , their fear in the moment , was palpable , a fact which the law asks juries to consider in such cases . But we should also ask whether the officers ’ actions were reasonable before they opened fire . Did their own decisions unnecessarily contribute to the moment of crisis ?
Other unjust police shootings in the same vein immediately come to mind .
In the terrible video of the shooting of Daniel Shaver , police can be heard screaming conflicting commands to him , including ordering him to “ crawl ” but not “ put his hands down for any reason. ” Shaver — unsteady , sobbing , crawling on the ground — is shot as he appears to try to pull up his pants .
Then there ’ s the horrifying story of Andrew Scott . The police , without their lights on , without a warrant , and without identifying themselves as police , pounded on the wrong door late at night . When Scott answered with a gun in his hand — as was his constitutional right , by the way — he was instantly shot dead . In that case , the officer not only wasn ’ t prosecuted , federal courts deemed him immune from any civil action .
And who can forget Philando Castile ? The officer in that case gave Castile two potentially hard-to-square commands : provide your license and don ’ t reach for your gun . As Castile reached for his license , he assured the officer that he was not reaching for his gun . He died anyway .
When we evaluate police shootings , we wrongly tend to limit our analysis to the very instant of the shooting itself . The question of a cop ’ s reasonable fear at that instant is allowed to trump all other concerns , and becomes the deciding factor at trial . I would argue , however , that officers act unreasonably when they don ’ t give a citizen a reasonable chance to live — and giving a citizen a reasonable chance to live involves properly handling the situation so no weapon need be fired .
Willie McCoy was a sleeping , obviously troubled man who woke up to screams and shots . He did not have to die . He should not have died . And unless we highlight cases like his , there will be more such tragedies ( and more heartbreak and political division ) in the years to come .

When the police arrive, they find McCoy fast asleep — so asleep and unresponsive that he seems closer to unconsciousness. In spite of the fact that they know that he has a gun (in the moment they think the magazine is halfway out of the gun and believe he has at most one shot, a potential round in the chamber), the officers cluster right by him, clearly in his sight line should he wake up. Then they discuss their plans. They consider opening the door and snatching the gun, or smashing the window open.

When McCoy does start to move, the officers’ response is dramatic. From the video, they seem reasonably relaxed when McCoy scratches his left shoulder, but then McCoy leans forward and appears to move his arm. There’s no indication he’s clearly awake, yet all at once, the officers start screaming, “Show me your hands!” so loudly that it’s necessary for captions to explain that the yells weren’t in fact gunshots. Within roughly three seconds, the officers start firing.

John Kavanagh reportedly came to a conclusion : “ This stuff is all planned ” by “ ideologues ” and “ anarchists , ” he told the Arizona Capitol Times .
In response , Senator Kavanagh sponsored a bill patterned on the kind of racketeering laws usually reserved for the Mafia : Anyone involved in a protest could be guilty of a felony if things get out of control , “ whether or not such person knows [ the ] identity ” of the person actually breaking a law .
Senate Republicans in Arizona voted in favor of Kavanagh ’ s proposal , joining conservative lawmakers in some 18 states in moving forward tough new bills intended to curb what they see as lawlessness during a new age of demonstrations and street mobilization .
For their part , opponents of those bills don ’ t see efforts to keep the peace – they see police state tactics . Civil rights activists say such bills violate the First Amendment and have more to do with chilling free expression than law and order , given that several of the proposals could open up peaceful protesters to serious criminal liability .
“ I don ’ t think it ’ s a coincidence that we are seeing [ antiprotest bills ] filed at a time when more and more Americans are taking to the streets to practice their constitutional right , ” says Mike Meno , an American Civil Liberties Union staffer in Raleigh , N.C .
The new bills come during a time of large-scale protests not seen since the civil rights era , as well as an emerging strategy to use economic pressure , through boycotts or more immediate actions , to force change . At a time of extreme political polarization – when half of Americans say they are “ afraid ” of the other side – Republican-led statehouses are probing the boundaries of what constitutes constitutionally-protected protest versus what makes a mob .
A strong-arm response to protesters pushing new bounds “ isn ’ t new … but I ’ ve also never seen anything quite like ” this spate of legislation , says Doug McAdam , a Stanford University sociologist and co-author of a forthcoming book “ The Origins of Our Fractured Society. ” “ It ’ s more evidence that we are really in a different period . The fact is , we haven ’ t really seen this kind of sustained political tension and popular mobilization since the early 1970s . As we speak , the dynamics of social movements are being transformed or significantly altered . ”
The wave of new demonstration-related bills have come in response to pipeline protests in North Dakota , train blockades in Washington State , and interstates crawling to a standstill in places such as Baltimore and Charlotte , N.C . Meanwhile , some Republican lawmakers facing stiff opposition to the repeal of Affordable Care Act in their home districts have begged off in-person town halls , citing as did Rep. Louie Gohmert ( R ) of Texas , “ the threat of violence ” from outside agitators .
“ I think these bills are indicative of the fact that , particularly on the left , you ’ ve seen the willingness to use protests to impede economic freedom , ” says Andrew Taylor , a political scientist at North Carolina State University in Raleigh . Given the corporate boycotts against the so-called “ bathroom law ” in North Carolina , for example , “ there ’ s a sense that the left is trying to coerce people into doing things by threatening their economic situation , and I think [ these bills ] are an outgrowth of that . ”
The tension comes as Pew finds that about half of Democrats and half of Republicans are “ afraid ” of the other side . Among highly politically active Americans , just over 6 in 10 say the other side scares them , a recent Pew survey reports .
Under that mantle of distrust , many of the so-called “ economic terrorism ” bills are built around a similar idea : That much of the dissent at protests and town halls is not only fake , but paid – intended not to debate but disrupt . The Pulitzer Prize-winning Politifact says there is no evidence that protesters are being paid ( just as there wasn ’ t when Democrats made similar claims about the tea party ) .
The vast majority of those involved , political scientists say , are everyday Americans invoking their constitutional right to free assembly .
The impulse to paint protesters as stooges “ goes back to the antiwar movement where politicians railed against Communist plants trying to undermine democracy , ” says Professor McAdam. ” “ And it ’ s the same thing as the left arguing in the wake of the tea party that it was AstroTurf , not real [ grass roots ] . There might be an exception here or there , but all of these are legitimate , popular forms of mobilization . ”
Nevertheless , Minnesota lawmakers have proposed a bill that would allow authorities to sue protesters for costs related to policing a protest . An “ economic terrorism ” bill in North Carolina would make blocking a street , currently a misdemeanor , a felony punishable by up to 25 months in prison .
Other bills would ban the use of masks and seize assets of those whose protests later turn violent .
After filing an “ economic terrorism ” bill late last year , state Sen. Doug Ericksen of Washington State pointed to antifracking protests in Olympia where groups have blocked trains by setting up camps on tracks as the impetus for a bill .
“ I completely support your First Amendment right to protest , ” Senator Ericksen told reporters . But “ you do not have the First Amendment right to block a train . ”
The problem for his bill is that he ’ s right : It ’ s already against the law to block streets or rail tracks . In fact , dozens of demonstrators have been arrested in recent weeks on misdemeanor trespass charges for blocking freight and passenger trains in Vancouver and Bellingham , Wash . Moreover , it ’ s illegal everywhere in the US to start a riot .
The bills are facing strong headwinds . If their penalties are redundant , the argument goes , why pass them unless the attempt is to chill free speech ? Citing concerns about perceptions of undermining First Amendment rights , Arizona 's Republican House speaker refused to hear Kavanagh 's bill , effectively killing it .
But there are some forms of protest that “ should be chilled , ” according to University of Tennessee law professor Glenn Reynolds . Ordinarily a promoter of free speech and expression on his libertarian-leaning Instapundit blog , found himself on the other side of the issue after the police shooting of Keith Scott in Charlotte , N.C .
During the second night of protests , Reynolds watched TV coverage of angry people spilling onto Interstate 85 and Interstate 277 , stopping traffic , looting , and , in one case , attacking a driver . After documenting those events in a series of tweets , Reynolds launched three words : “ Run them down. ” He quickly and publicly apologized for seeming to advocate the targeting of protesters , which he says he did not .
In an email to the Monitor , Reynolds notes that his tweet “ referred to legitimate self-defense against violent rioters who were smashing windshields , looting trucks , and beating people unconscious , ” adding that “ violent assaults on motorists are never ‘ legitimate dissent ' ... [ and ] should be chilled. ” The fact is , he writes , “ even nonviolent blocking of roads is quite dangerous , drastically raising the risk that protesters will be accidentally run over , or that stopped motorists will be rear-ended , as well as the danger of impeding emergency services , ambulances , etc. , which has happened already in some cases . ”
A handful of states have now proposed relieving motorists of liability should they hurt someone while trying to escape from a highway protest .
What ’ s also fueling concerns among conservatives is that social media mobilization has enabled protesters to get out ahead of authorities as protests develop , sometimes leaving police anxious and unprepared . That dynamic only heightens tensions .
“ Authorities are feeling caught off guard by the increased dexterity that comes with social media , ” says Michael Heaney , a political sociologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor . He notes , however , that social media organization also can act as a balm , creating “ a kind of organization to what might otherwise be a riot . ”
If any of the laws pass , federal courts will take a hard look at whether they infringe First Amendment rights .
The Supreme Court has , in the name of public safety , afforded authorities leeway to crack down on protests where life and property may be affected . But the high court has also acknowledged the importance of streets to the conduct of democracy , noting in one landmark case that assembly and discussion in “ streets and parks ” is “ part of the privileges , immunities , rights , and liberties of citizens . ”
Lower courts “ won ’ t stand ” for throwing legitimate protesters in jail or forcing them to pay for security , says Professor Heaney .
“ These cases get heard by judges who deal with real criminals . Those judges , whether liberal or conservative , know the difference between someone who is trying to make the world a better place and who is not . ”","After watching protests erupt around the country against police shootings, tougher immigration laws, and the Trump administration, Arizona state Sen. John Kavanagh reportedly came to a conclusion: “This stuff is all planned” by “ideologues” and “anarchists,” he told the Arizona Capitol Times.

In response, Senator Kavanagh sponsored a bill patterned on the kind of racketeering laws usually reserved for the Mafia: Anyone involved in a protest could be guilty of a felony if things get out of control, “whether or not such person knows [the] identity” of the person actually breaking a law.

Senate Republicans in Arizona voted in favor of Kavanagh’s proposal, joining conservative lawmakers in some 18 states in moving forward tough new bills intended to curb what they see as lawlessness during a new age of demonstrations and street mobilization.

For their part, opponents of those bills don’t see efforts to keep the peace – they see police state tactics. Civil rights activists say such bills violate the First Amendment and have more to do with chilling free expression than law and order, given that several of the proposals could open up peaceful protesters to serious criminal liability.

“I don’t think it’s a coincidence that we are seeing [antiprotest bills] filed at a time when more and more Americans are taking to the streets to practice their constitutional right,” says Mike Meno, an American Civil Liberties Union staffer in Raleigh, N.C.

The new bills come during a time of large-scale protests not seen since the civil rights era, as well as an emerging strategy to use economic pressure, through boycotts or more immediate actions, to force change. At a time of extreme political polarization – when half of Americans say they are “afraid” of the other side – Republican-led statehouses are probing the boundaries of what constitutes constitutionally-protected protest versus what makes a mob.

A strong-arm response to protesters pushing new bounds “isn’t new … but I’ve also never seen anything quite like” this spate of legislation, says Doug McAdam, a Stanford University sociologist and co-author of a forthcoming book “The Origins of Our Fractured Society.” “It’s more evidence that we are really in a different period. The fact is, we haven’t really seen this kind of sustained political tension and popular mobilization since the early 1970s. As we speak, the dynamics of social movements are being transformed or significantly altered.”

The wave of new demonstration-related bills have come in response to pipeline protests in North Dakota, train blockades in Washington State, and interstates crawling to a standstill in places such as Baltimore and Charlotte, N.C. Meanwhile, some Republican lawmakers facing stiff opposition to the repeal of Affordable Care Act in their home districts have begged off in-person town halls, citing as did Rep. Louie Gohmert (R) of Texas, “the threat of violence” from outside agitators.

“I think these bills are indicative of the fact that, particularly on the left, you’ve seen the willingness to use protests to impede economic freedom,” says Andrew Taylor, a political scientist at North Carolina State University in Raleigh. Given the corporate boycotts against the so-called “bathroom law” in North Carolina, for example, “there’s a sense that the left is trying to coerce people into doing things by threatening their economic situation, and I think [these bills] are an outgrowth of that.”

'Scared' of the other political party

The tension comes as Pew finds that about half of Democrats and half of Republicans are “afraid” of the other side. Among highly politically active Americans, just over 6 in 10 say the other side scares them, a recent Pew survey reports.

Under that mantle of distrust, many of the so-called “economic terrorism” bills are built around a similar idea: That much of the dissent at protests and town halls is not only fake, but paid – intended not to debate but disrupt. The Pulitzer Prize-winning Politifact says there is no evidence that protesters are being paid (just as there wasn’t when Democrats made similar claims about the tea party).

The vast majority of those involved, political scientists say, are everyday Americans invoking their constitutional right to free assembly.

The impulse to paint protesters as stooges “goes back to the antiwar movement where politicians railed against Communist plants trying to undermine democracy,” says Professor McAdam.” “And it’s the same thing as the left arguing in the wake of the tea party that it was AstroTurf, not real [grass roots]. There might be an exception here or there, but all of these are legitimate, popular forms of mobilization.”

'Economic terrorism'

Nevertheless, Minnesota lawmakers have proposed a bill that would allow authorities to sue protesters for costs related to policing a protest. An “economic terrorism” bill in North Carolina would make blocking a street, currently a misdemeanor, a felony punishable by up to 25 months in prison.

Other bills would ban the use of masks and seize assets of those whose protests later turn violent.

After filing an “economic terrorism” bill late last year, state Sen. Doug Ericksen of Washington State pointed to antifracking protests in Olympia where groups have blocked trains by setting up camps on tracks as the impetus for a bill.

“I completely support your First Amendment right to protest,” Senator Ericksen told reporters. But “you do not have the First Amendment right to block a train.”

Bills face strong headwinds

The problem for his bill is that he’s right: It’s already against the law to block streets or rail tracks. In fact, dozens of demonstrators have been arrested in recent weeks on misdemeanor trespass charges for blocking freight and passenger trains in Vancouver and Bellingham, Wash. Moreover, it’s illegal everywhere in the US to start a riot.

The bills are facing strong headwinds. If their penalties are redundant, the argument goes, why pass them unless the attempt is to chill free speech? Citing concerns about perceptions of undermining First Amendment rights, Arizona's Republican House speaker refused to hear Kavanagh's bill, effectively killing it.

But there are some forms of protest that “should be chilled,” according to University of Tennessee law professor Glenn Reynolds. Ordinarily a promoter of free speech and expression on his libertarian-leaning Instapundit blog, found himself on the other side of the issue after the police shooting of Keith Scott in Charlotte, N.C.

During the second night of protests, Reynolds watched TV coverage of angry people spilling onto Interstate 85 and Interstate 277, stopping traffic, looting, and, in one case, attacking a driver. After documenting those events in a series of tweets, Reynolds launched three words: “Run them down.” He quickly and publicly apologized for seeming to advocate the targeting of protesters, which he says he did not.

In an email to the Monitor, Reynolds notes that his tweet “referred to legitimate self-defense against violent rioters who were smashing windshields, looting trucks, and beating people unconscious,” adding that “violent assaults on motorists are never ‘legitimate dissent' ... [and] should be chilled.” The fact is, he writes, “even nonviolent blocking of roads is quite dangerous, drastically raising the risk that protesters will be accidentally run over, or that stopped motorists will be rear-ended, as well as the danger of impeding emergency services, ambulances, etc., which has happened already in some cases.”

A handful of states have now proposed relieving motorists of liability should they hurt someone while trying to escape from a highway protest.

What’s also fueling concerns among conservatives is that social media mobilization has enabled protesters to get out ahead of authorities as protests develop, sometimes leaving police anxious and unprepared. That dynamic only heightens tensions.

“Authorities are feeling caught off guard by the increased dexterity that comes with social media,” says Michael Heaney, a political sociologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. He notes, however, that social media organization also can act as a balm, creating “a kind of organization to what might otherwise be a riot.”

Courts may weigh in

If any of the laws pass, federal courts will take a hard look at whether they infringe First Amendment rights.

The Supreme Court has, in the name of public safety, afforded authorities leeway to crack down on protests where life and property may be affected. But the high court has also acknowledged the importance of streets to the conduct of democracy, noting in one landmark case that assembly and discussion in “streets and parks” is “part of the privileges, immunities, rights, and liberties of citizens.”

Lower courts “won’t stand” for throwing legitimate protesters in jail or forcing them to pay for security, says Professor Heaney.

Quick guide What you need to know about the Trump-Russia inquiry Show Hide How serious are the allegations ? The story of Donald Trump and Russia comes down to this : a sitting president or his campaign is suspected of having coordinated with a foreign country to manipulate a US election . The story could not be bigger , and the stakes for Trump – and the country – could not be higher . What are the key questions ? Investigators are asking two basic questions : did Trump ’ s presidential campaign collude at any level with Russian operatives to sway the 2016 US presidential election ? And did Trump or others break the law to throw investigators off the trail ? What does the country think ? While a majority of the American public now believes that Russia tried to disrupt the US election , opinions about Trump campaign involvement tend to split along partisan lines : 73 % of Republicans , but only 13 % of Democrats , believe Trump did “ nothing wrong ” in his dealings with Russia and its president , Vladimir Putin . What are the implications for Trump ? The affair has the potential to eject Trump from office . Experienced legal observers believe that prosecutors are investigating whether Trump committed an obstruction of justice . Both Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton – the only presidents to face impeachment proceedings in the last century – were accused of obstruction of justice . But Trump ’ s fate is probably up to the voters . Even if strong evidence of wrongdoing by him or his cohort emerged , a Republican congressional majority would probably block any action to remove him from office . ( Such an action would be a historical rarity . ) What has happened so far ? Former foreign policy adviser George Papadopolous pleaded guilty to perjury over his contacts with Russians linked to the Kremlin , and the president ’ s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and another aide face charges of money laundering . When will the inquiry come to an end ? The investigations have an open timeline .
Flynn resigned last February after it was revealed he misled Vice-President Mike Pence about the nature of his communications with the then-Russian ambassador , Sergey Kislyak .
After Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI , Trump suggested in a tweet that was the reason behind his firing , contradicting the White House ’ s earlier claims that the decision was made in relation to Pence .
Comey also testified that Trump had privately demanded loyalty from him , and that he had only promised “ honesty ” . Sessions was part of discussions around Comey ’ s firing , but because of his recusal the decision of a special counsel fell to the deputy attorney general , Rod Rosenstein , who appointed Muller .

Mueller is also due to interview Trump ’ s former chief strategist , Steve Bannon .","The attorney general, Jeff Sessions, has been interviewed by Robert Mueller, as part of his investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, a justice department spokeswoman said on Tuesday.



Sarah Isgur Flores confirmed to the Guardian that the meeting took place. The New York Times first reported the meeting on Tuesday morning.

It was also reported on Tuesday that the special counsel is seeking to interview Donald Trump in relation to the president’s decision to fire former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former FBI director James Comey.

The Washington Post reported that Trump’s lawyers are negotiating the terms of an interview with the special counsel, with the president’s legal team preferring that he answer some questions in person and others in a written statement.

John Dowd, an attorney for Trump, declined to comment.

Mueller’s reported focus on the firings of Flynn and Comey is the latest indication that the special counsel’s team is zeroing in on potential obstruction of justice issues.

Earlier this month, Mueller reportedly called back a key witness in the infamous June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between senior campaign officials and a Russian lawyer connected to the Kremlin. Trump’s elder son, Donald Trump Jr, accepted the meeting after being offered damaging information about Hillary Clinton and informed of an effort by Moscow to aid his father’s campaign.

Comey was also reportedly interviewed by the special counsel’s office.

That interview reportedly took place last year and pertained to a series of memos Comey wrote, while he was FBI director, about his conversations with Trump about the Russia investigation. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, raising concerns that he tried to obstruct the FBI investigation into his campaign’s contacts with Russians.

Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, said the White House was going to be “fully cooperative with special counsel and continue to do that throughout the process”. But she declined to answer questions about specific interviews.

The special counsel’s office is investigating a Kremlin campaign to meddle in the 2016 election, including the hacking of Democratic party members’ emails and their release to the public. Led by former FBI director Robert Mueller, the team is also investigating interactions between members of Trump’s campaign and Russians potentially involved in those efforts.

The meeting between Mueller and Sessions lasted several hours and took place last week, marking the first time the special counsel’s office has interviewed a sitting member of Trump’s cabinet.

Profile Who is Robert Mueller? Show Hide Background Robert S Mueller III, 74, is a former FBI director who was appointed by George W Bush and held over by Barack Obama beyond his 10-year term. The term extension required special congressional action which the Senate approved 100-0. Previously, Mueller held two different US attorney posts and was an assistant attorney general in the George HW Bush administration.

Special counsel Mueller was appointed special counsel in May 2017, eight days after Trump fired FBI director James Comey. A special counsel is a prosecutor appointed in extraordinary circumstances or in cases of conflicts of interest within the justice department. In this case, there was a need for someone to investigate the Russian matter who was not appointed by or beholden to Trump. Mueller’s team of 17 lawyers operates independently of, but (ideally) in cooperation with, Congress, which has three committees conducting investigations in parallel to Mueller. Mueller is expected to submit a report to Congress and may bring criminal charges separately. Mueller has a sizeable budget and an open-ended term. He is specifically authorized to investigate “any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump” plus any matters that “may arise directly from the investigation”. He has the power to prosecute federal crimes. Can he be replaced? In theory, William Barr, the new attorney general, could fire Mueller. Barr, who once criticised Mueller's case as “fatally misconceived”, was asked during his confirmation hearing if he would fire the special counsel without good cause and replied: ""I would not carry out that instruction."" Although, if Trump wanted to fire Mueller, and Barr was unwilling, Trump could replace Barr.

Sessions has long been a flashpoint in the Russia investigation.

The president has also drawn scrutiny for pressing Comey to drop his investigation into Flynn, according to testimony the former FBI director gave to Congress last year.



Trump denied Comey’s claim, but after firing him told NBC he did so because, “I said to myself, I said you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.”

Quick guide What you need to know about the Trump-Russia inquiry Show Hide How serious are the allegations? The story of Donald Trump and Russia comes down to this: a sitting president or his campaign is suspected of having coordinated with a foreign country to manipulate a US election. The story could not be bigger, and the stakes for Trump – and the country – could not be higher. What are the key questions? Investigators are asking two basic questions: did Trump’s presidential campaign collude at any level with Russian operatives to sway the 2016 US presidential election? And did Trump or others break the law to throw investigators off the trail? What does the country think? While a majority of the American public now believes that Russia tried to disrupt the US election, opinions about Trump campaign involvement tend to split along partisan lines: 73% of Republicans, but only 13% of Democrats, believe Trump did “nothing wrong” in his dealings with Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin. What are the implications for Trump? The affair has the potential to eject Trump from office. Experienced legal observers believe that prosecutors are investigating whether Trump committed an obstruction of justice. Both Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton – the only presidents to face impeachment proceedings in the last century – were accused of obstruction of justice. But Trump’s fate is probably up to the voters. Even if strong evidence of wrongdoing by him or his cohort emerged, a Republican congressional majority would probably block any action to remove him from office. (Such an action would be a historical rarity.) What has happened so far? Former foreign policy adviser George Papadopolous pleaded guilty to perjury over his contacts with Russians linked to the Kremlin, and the president’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and another aide face charges of money laundering. When will the inquiry come to an end? The investigations have an open timeline.

Flynn resigned last February after it was revealed he misled Vice-President Mike Pence about the nature of his communications with the then-Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak.



After Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, Trump suggested in a tweet that was the reason behind his firing, contradicting the White House’s earlier claims that the decision was made in relation to Pence.

Comey also testified that Trump had privately demanded loyalty from him, and that he had only promised “honesty”. Sessions was part of discussions around Comey’s firing, but because of his recusal the decision of a special counsel fell to the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Muller.

Mueller’s investigation has so far led to charges against Flynn, for lying to the FBI, and against Trump’s former campaign chairman and one of his aides, Paul Manafort and Rick Gates respectively, on charges of conspiracy and money laundering. Another former campaign adviser, George Papadopoulos, has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and admitted to early knowledge that the Russian government possessed hacked Democratic emails. Mueller is also due to interview Trump’s former chief strategist, Steve Bannon.",www.theguardian.com,left,0szpfbHmqPoYGUAc

During the incident, two officers, identified in court documents as Groger and Heffley, were conducting a “routine foot patrol” in Wheaton, Md., when they noticed Pacheco alone in a “dark parking spot” behind a laundromat, the court’s 27-page opinion states.

But his legacy is going to get the last laugh . If President Trump and all his appointees left office tomorrow , instead of Sessions , the mark Sessions has left on policy would be the most enduring .
While other Cabinet officials have gotten sucked into White House drama or caught in their own venal scandals , Sessions has generally kept his attention on doing his job — even at the cost of his relationship with the president . He ’ s pulled every available lever to redirect the considerable resources of the Department of Justice ( DOJ ) to fight the crimes he considers most serious : violent crimes , drug crime , and , most notably , violations of immigration law .
The DOJ ’ s role in the immigration system isn ’ t widely understood , but it ’ s crucial . Illegal entry and reentry aren ’ t just the most commonly prosecuted federal crimes — they make up a majority of all federal convictions . The litigation the DOJ chooses to file can help tilt the balance between state , federal , and local governments as the three try to negotiate who gets to help — or has to help — enforce immigration law . Perhaps most importantly , the part of the deportation process that has so far posed the biggest obstacle to mass deportation — the immigration court system — is under Sessions ’ s control .
Sessions , at heart , is a prosecutor . He understands the complicated and sensitive legal system he currently wields power over as well as anyone — but he understands it as a weapon with which to protect America against people who would do it harm . And while his peers in the Republican Party tried to strike a balance between “ good ” legal immigrants and “ bad ” illegal ones , he has always taken a skeptical attitude toward immigrants and immigration , period , believing that the burden of proof ought to be on an immigrant to prove that she deserves to come to or stay in the US , and preferring , always , to keep worthy people out rather than let anyone unworthy in .
Immigration brought Trump and Sessions together . The issue has defined both their political careers : Trump ’ s , short but meteoric , through the Republican ranks in the 2016 presidential campaign and into the White House ; Sessions ’ s , a decades-long sojourn in the wilderness of immigration hawkishness while the Republican Party retained some moderation on the issue throughout the Bush and Obama years .
Trump gave Sessions a legacy , bringing the Republican Party closer to him . Then Sessions spent two nearly-thankless years laboring to give Trump one , using every power he possessed as attorney general to ensure that the scales of justice tip toward punishment of unauthorized immigrants as often as possible .
Jeff Sessions ’ s entire career built toward the task of “ ending illegality ” in immigration
In an administration whose most senior policy officials are either total policy neophytes ( Ben Carson , Jared Kushner ) or at least unaccustomed to the stakes and scrutiny of federal policymaking ( Ryan Zinke , Scott Pruitt , John Kelly ) , Jeff Sessions stood apart . He has spent decades in the business of federal law , as a federal prosecutor and senator .
It ’ s no coincidence that Sessions was the anomaly in Trump ’ s Cabinet , the seasoned vet in a clubhouse full of rookies . Sessions is among the few veterans of Republican Party governance who could serve helpfully in a Trump administration , because his policy positions weren ’ t mainstream among congressional Republicans until Trump came along .
Sessions has long been particularly concerned about immigration to America , in ways most Republican policymakers simply were not . He often found himself leading a faction of his own party — often a small one — against bipartisan efforts endorsed or at least tolerated by Republican leadership . In 2013 , during the Senate ’ s most recent comprehensive immigration reform fight , Sessions took a lonely stand against the bipartisan “ Gang of Eight ” immigration bill in the Senate Judiciary Committee — and then had to quarterback the bill ’ s opponents on the Senate floor when then-Minority Leader Mitch McConnell declined to steer his caucus one way or the other on the bill .
Part of what distinguished Sessions from other Republicans was his skepticism not just of illegal immigration but of all immigration . As Sessions has put it , more people want to move to the United States than the country could ever possibly accept ; the dividing line between whom the country should accept and whom it shouldn ’ t , he believes , should be determined by the American people based on who they feel serves the “ national interest ” — defined as assimilating into American culture and helping the fortunes of American workers .
The other part , subtler but no less important , was his attitude toward unauthorized immigrants . Sessions isn ’ t just an immigration hawk who rejects “ amnesty ” for unauthorized immigrants who have settled in the US ; he has long advocated that the federal government has an obligation to “ end illegality ” in the immigration system , full stop .
Other immigration hawks — most notably President Trump himself — seize on specific high-profile incidents to make their points : A caravan of a few hundred Central American asylum seekers becomes a symbol for a tide of dubious asylum claimants ; a particularly gruesome MS-13 murder becomes evidence that “ sanctuary cities ” should be eradicated .
Sessions has generally preferred a logical , categorical approach : The problem with unauthorized immigration is that it is illegal , and that illegality itself causes real pain to American citizens . Because Sessions doesn ’ t rely on “ bad ” unauthorized immigrants to make his point , he doesn ’ t open the door for sympathy toward “ good ” ones .
Trump took to Twitter to reassure DACA recipients that they ’ d be able to stay ; it was Sessions who made the case to the public that , in fact , it was better for America that they leave .
On one side , Sessions believes , stand “ special interests ” like immigrant advocacy groups , unions , and corporations . On the other side stand “ the American people , ” who are personally afflicted by unauthorized immigration , and rank-and-file immigration agents who were ( before Trump ) ignored by their own superiors in Washington . And in Sessions ’ s view , elected officials have too often landed on the wrong side .
“ The American people have pleaded with us to end the illegality , ” he argued on the Senate floor during the 2013 immigration debate , “ and create a lawful system that serves the national interest — a system we can be proud of . And for 30 years , Congress has failed . ”
The Republican Party has come to Sessions . In 2014 , he was named the head of the immigration subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee . The following year , Donald Trump seized momentum in the Republican presidential primary by attacking immigration as a threat to Americans ’ personal and national security , and Sessions saw an opportunity . He was among the first members of Congress to endorse Trump . He and his staff took the lead in writing policy proposals . And when Trump was elected , Sessions was named to one of the most powerful positions in the federal government .
Jeff Sessions took control of the system that is key to mass deportation
In Trump ’ s first year , arrests of unauthorized immigrants by Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) agents ( responsible for immigration enforcement in the “ interior ” of the US , away from the border ) spiked 41 percent — nearly enough to make up for a steep decline in the number of immigrants crossing the border and getting caught by Border Patrol .
But the Trump administration can ’ t arrest its way to mass deportation . It has to fix the immigration court system . And Jeff Sessions knew that very well .
Immigrants arrested within the US are entitled to a hearing in immigration court — and that legal process can stretch on for months , even years . The backlog of pending immigration court cases is now over 650,000 . The average case currently pending in court has been pending for 711 days . And because immigrants who ’ ve been living in the US for longer and don ’ t have criminal records are likely to fight deportation harder and longer , arresting more of those immigrants — as ICE is doing — is likely to swell the backlog even more than arresting the same number of immigrants with criminal records would .
In speeches , Sessions characterized immigration courts as gummed up by frivolous asylum claims and sabotaged by “ dirty immigration lawyers ” trying to sneak their clients into legal status they don ’ t deserve . ( Among a certain group of immigration lawyers , “ dirty immigration lawyer ” has become a “ nasty woman ” –like badge of honor . ) He made it clear not just that immigration courts aren ’ t moving quickly enough , but that people who deserve to be deported aren ’ t getting deported quickly enough ( or at all ) .
But Sessions didn ’ t use his leadership of the DOJ simply to make the immigration court system more efficient . He used the full extent of his power as attorney general to reduce the likelihood that a case gets resolved ( quickly or otherwise ) in an immigrant ’ s favor — removing tools and resources that make courts more efficient but improve immigrants ’ odds of winning their cases , while pressuring immigration judges to plow through cases at an unheard-of rate . He removed the safety valves from the pipeline while increasing the pressure .
Thanks to Sessions , judges are forced to decide immigrants ’ fate in a matter of hours
In early April , the DOJ sent a memo to all immigration judges telling them that “ efficiency ” would now factor into their performance reviews . The DOJ set standards that it called “ benchmarks ” : Judges would need to complete at least 700 cases a year to earn a “ satisfactory ” rating , while completion of fewer than 560 cases would lead to a judge being deemed “ unsatisfactory . ”
Immigration judges and lawyers assailed the “ benchmarks ” as quotas . But a DOJ source shrugged about the new directive to the Washington Post , saying that 700 cases was only “ three cases a day. ” The National Association of Immigration Judges , the judges union , estimates that when you account for the days court isn ’ t in session and other factors , it ’ s more like four cases a day .
“ Anecdotally , ” said judges union head Ashley Tabaddor this spring , “ we ’ re not aware that this is a number that is even close to being reasonable . ”
The “ benchmarks ” get into the details of court proceedings too . In cases where the judge has to review the judgment of an asylum officer about whether an asylum seeker can claim a “ credible ” fear ” or “ reasonable fear ” of persecution or torture , the DOJ says the judge should be able ( 85 percent of the time ) to make a decision that same day .
Immigration lawyers worry that they simply can ’ t put together a compelling case in that time . “ Often [ you need ] documents from overseas that take time to get , documents from hospitals in other countries , to document your persecution claim , ” says Karen Lucas of the American Immigration Lawyers ’ Association .
Immigration court cases are famously complex — if a judge considers all the possible outcomes . But if she ’ s just rubber-stamping deportations , they go much faster . And immigration judges and lawyers alike are deeply concerned that at the pace of three or more rulings a day , there is no way for immigration court to become anything other than a deportation assembly line .
Sessions worked to reduce options for judges and immigrant defendants
At the same time that the DOJ told judges that cases need to go faster , though , it made moves to eliminate some things that allowed cases to go faster but made it more likely that immigrants won .
In April , for example , the DOJ announced abruptly that it was suspending a program that offered group “ legal orientation ” workshops to immigrants in detention centers — explaining to them how court hearings worked ( necessary because there ’ s no right to a lawyer in immigration court ) and what options they might have to prevent a deportation order .
The DOJ claimed it was “ pausing ” the legal orientation program to evaluate its effectiveness . But the lead contractor , the Vera Institute for Justice , says they received an email from DOJ telling them “ there is not intent that the program will be renewed . ”
The Vera Institute was blindsided — not least because the legal orientation program had been evaluated in 2012 , and found to make the system more efficient . Because immigrants weren ’ t fighting hopeless cases , court cases took an average of 12 fewer days to resolve and the government saved an average of six nights in detention costs — for a total savings of $ 17.8 million a year over and above the cost of administering the orientation .
“ This seems totally contrary to the Department of Justice ’ s interests , ” Oren Root of Vera told ███ in April . “ Their biggest problem , from their point of view , is getting cases concluded . And here is a tool that is proven by their own study to be effective in doing that . ”
The DOJ reversed its decision to suspend legal orientations under pressure from members of Congress . But it re-evaluated the program ’ s effectiveness — and found , in a report with what the Vera Institute called “ insurmountable flaws , ” that it was actually a cost-waster for the federal government .
There ’ s a similar pattern in the cases that Sessions referred to himself for review from the Board of Immigration Appeals , a tactic he used aggressively in the second half of his short tenure . In May , Sessions ruled that judges couldn ’ t move cases off their docket by closing them without a deportation order — and opened the door to the reopening of 350,000 cases that had already been closed this way .
Sessions proceeded to put severe constraints on judges ’ ability to grant asylum to victims of violence from non-state actors ( like domestic abusers or gangs ) , and limit judges ’ abilities to delay a hearing to let the immigrant apply for legal status elsewhere . At the time of his resignation , his office was working on new opinions in cases regarding whether asylum-seekers had the right to a bond hearing and whether judges could dismiss their cases without a hearing at all .
All these changes , and threatened changes , to immigration courts would create a ratchet . Judges would have to get through more cases due to the “ performance measures , ” without being able to move cases off their docket by closing them — their primary tool of docket control over the past few years . They ’ d have to make rulings in asylum cases more quickly , without giving immigrants time to present evidence , and without being able to grant asylum on the basis of domestic violence . They ’ d have to find time for hopeless cases that immigrants might not have tried to fight if they had gone through “ legal orientation ” — taking time away from cases immigrants could actually win if given the chance .

But his legacy is going to get the last laugh. If President Trump and all his appointees left office tomorrow, instead of Sessions, the mark Sessions has left on policy would be the most enduring.

While other Cabinet officials have gotten sucked into White House drama or caught in their own venal scandals, Sessions has generally kept his attention on doing his job — even at the cost of his relationship with the president. He’s pulled every available lever to redirect the considerable resources of the Department of Justice (DOJ) to fight the crimes he considers most serious: violent crimes, drug crime, and, most notably, violations of immigration law.

The DOJ’s role in the immigration system isn’t widely understood, but it’s crucial. Illegal entry and reentry aren’t just the most commonly prosecuted federal crimes — they make up a majority of all federal convictions. The litigation the DOJ chooses to file can help tilt the balance between state, federal, and local governments as the three try to negotiate who gets to help — or has to help — enforce immigration law. Perhaps most importantly, the part of the deportation process that has so far posed the biggest obstacle to mass deportation — the immigration court system — is under Sessions’s control.

Sessions, at heart, is a prosecutor. He understands the complicated and sensitive legal system he currently wields power over as well as anyone — but he understands it as a weapon with which to protect America against people who would do it harm. And while his peers in the Republican Party tried to strike a balance between “good” legal immigrants and “bad” illegal ones, he has always taken a skeptical attitude toward immigrants and immigration, period, believing that the burden of proof ought to be on an immigrant to prove that she deserves to come to or stay in the US, and preferring, always, to keep worthy people out rather than let anyone unworthy in.

Immigration brought Trump and Sessions together. The issue has defined both their political careers: Trump’s, short but meteoric, through the Republican ranks in the 2016 presidential campaign and into the White House; Sessions’s, a decades-long sojourn in the wilderness of immigration hawkishness while the Republican Party retained some moderation on the issue throughout the Bush and Obama years.

Trump gave Sessions a legacy, bringing the Republican Party closer to him. Then Sessions spent two nearly-thankless years laboring to give Trump one, using every power he possessed as attorney general to ensure that the scales of justice tip toward punishment of unauthorized immigrants as often as possible.

Jeff Sessions’s entire career built toward the task of “ending illegality” in immigration

In an administration whose most senior policy officials are either total policy neophytes (Ben Carson, Jared Kushner) or at least unaccustomed to the stakes and scrutiny of federal policymaking (Ryan Zinke, Scott Pruitt, John Kelly), Jeff Sessions stood apart. He has spent decades in the business of federal law, as a federal prosecutor and senator.

It’s no coincidence that Sessions was the anomaly in Trump’s Cabinet, the seasoned vet in a clubhouse full of rookies. Sessions is among the few veterans of Republican Party governance who could serve helpfully in a Trump administration, because his policy positions weren’t mainstream among congressional Republicans until Trump came along.

Sessions has long been particularly concerned about immigration to America, in ways most Republican policymakers simply were not. He often found himself leading a faction of his own party — often a small one — against bipartisan efforts endorsed or at least tolerated by Republican leadership. In 2013, during the Senate’s most recent comprehensive immigration reform fight, Sessions took a lonely stand against the bipartisan “Gang of Eight” immigration bill in the Senate Judiciary Committee — and then had to quarterback the bill’s opponents on the Senate floor when then-Minority Leader Mitch McConnell declined to steer his caucus one way or the other on the bill.

Part of what distinguished Sessions from other Republicans was his skepticism not just of illegal immigration but of all immigration. As Sessions has put it, more people want to move to the United States than the country could ever possibly accept; the dividing line between whom the country should accept and whom it shouldn’t, he believes, should be determined by the American people based on who they feel serves the “national interest” — defined as assimilating into American culture and helping the fortunes of American workers.

The other part, subtler but no less important, was his attitude toward unauthorized immigrants. Sessions isn’t just an immigration hawk who rejects “amnesty” for unauthorized immigrants who have settled in the US; he has long advocated that the federal government has an obligation to “end illegality” in the immigration system, full stop.

Other immigration hawks — most notably President Trump himself — seize on specific high-profile incidents to make their points: A caravan of a few hundred Central American asylum seekers becomes a symbol for a tide of dubious asylum claimants; a particularly gruesome MS-13 murder becomes evidence that “sanctuary cities” should be eradicated.

Sessions has generally preferred a logical, categorical approach: The problem with unauthorized immigration is that it is illegal, and that illegality itself causes real pain to American citizens. Because Sessions doesn’t rely on “bad” unauthorized immigrants to make his point, he doesn’t open the door for sympathy toward “good” ones.

Trump took to Twitter to reassure DACA recipients that they’d be able to stay; it was Sessions who made the case to the public that, in fact, it was better for America that they leave.

On one side, Sessions believes, stand “special interests” like immigrant advocacy groups, unions, and corporations. On the other side stand “the American people,” who are personally afflicted by unauthorized immigration, and rank-and-file immigration agents who were (before Trump) ignored by their own superiors in Washington. And in Sessions’s view, elected officials have too often landed on the wrong side.

“The American people have pleaded with us to end the illegality,” he argued on the Senate floor during the 2013 immigration debate, “and create a lawful system that serves the national interest — a system we can be proud of. And for 30 years, Congress has failed.”

The Republican Party has come to Sessions. In 2014, he was named the head of the immigration subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The following year, Donald Trump seized momentum in the Republican presidential primary by attacking immigration as a threat to Americans’ personal and national security, and Sessions saw an opportunity. He was among the first members of Congress to endorse Trump. He and his staff took the lead in writing policy proposals. And when Trump was elected, Sessions was named to one of the most powerful positions in the federal government.

Jeff Sessions took control of the system that is key to mass deportation

In Trump’s first year, arrests of unauthorized immigrants by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents (responsible for immigration enforcement in the “interior” of the US, away from the border) spiked 41 percent — nearly enough to make up for a steep decline in the number of immigrants crossing the border and getting caught by Border Patrol.

But the Trump administration can’t arrest its way to mass deportation. It has to fix the immigration court system. And Jeff Sessions knew that very well.

Immigrants arrested within the US are entitled to a hearing in immigration court — and that legal process can stretch on for months, even years. The backlog of pending immigration court cases is now over 650,000. The average case currently pending in court has been pending for 711 days. And because immigrants who’ve been living in the US for longer and don’t have criminal records are likely to fight deportation harder and longer, arresting more of those immigrants — as ICE is doing — is likely to swell the backlog even more than arresting the same number of immigrants with criminal records would.

In speeches, Sessions characterized immigration courts as gummed up by frivolous asylum claims and sabotaged by “dirty immigration lawyers” trying to sneak their clients into legal status they don’t deserve. (Among a certain group of immigration lawyers, “dirty immigration lawyer” has become a “nasty woman”–like badge of honor.) He made it clear not just that immigration courts aren’t moving quickly enough, but that people who deserve to be deported aren’t getting deported quickly enough (or at all).

But Sessions didn’t use his leadership of the DOJ simply to make the immigration court system more efficient. He used the full extent of his power as attorney general to reduce the likelihood that a case gets resolved (quickly or otherwise) in an immigrant’s favor — removing tools and resources that make courts more efficient but improve immigrants’ odds of winning their cases, while pressuring immigration judges to plow through cases at an unheard-of rate. He removed the safety valves from the pipeline while increasing the pressure.

Thanks to Sessions, judges are forced to decide immigrants’ fate in a matter of hours

In early April, the DOJ sent a memo to all immigration judges telling them that “efficiency” would now factor into their performance reviews. The DOJ set standards that it called “benchmarks”: Judges would need to complete at least 700 cases a year to earn a “satisfactory” rating, while completion of fewer than 560 cases would lead to a judge being deemed “unsatisfactory.”

Immigration judges and lawyers assailed the “benchmarks” as quotas. But a DOJ source shrugged about the new directive to the Washington Post, saying that 700 cases was only “three cases a day.” The National Association of Immigration Judges, the judges union, estimates that when you account for the days court isn’t in session and other factors, it’s more like four cases a day.

“Anecdotally,” said judges union head Ashley Tabaddor this spring, “we’re not aware that this is a number that is even close to being reasonable.”

The “benchmarks” get into the details of court proceedings too. In cases where the judge has to review the judgment of an asylum officer about whether an asylum seeker can claim a “credible” fear” or “reasonable fear” of persecution or torture, the DOJ says the judge should be able (85 percent of the time) to make a decision that same day.

Immigration lawyers worry that they simply can’t put together a compelling case in that time. “Often [you need] documents from overseas that take time to get, documents from hospitals in other countries, to document your persecution claim,” says Karen Lucas of the American Immigration Lawyers’ Association.

Immigration court cases are famously complex — if a judge considers all the possible outcomes. But if she’s just rubber-stamping deportations, they go much faster. And immigration judges and lawyers alike are deeply concerned that at the pace of three or more rulings a day, there is no way for immigration court to become anything other than a deportation assembly line.

Sessions worked to reduce options for judges and immigrant defendants

At the same time that the DOJ told judges that cases need to go faster, though, it made moves to eliminate some things that allowed cases to go faster but made it more likely that immigrants won.

In April, for example, the DOJ announced abruptly that it was suspending a program that offered group “legal orientation” workshops to immigrants in detention centers — explaining to them how court hearings worked (necessary because there’s no right to a lawyer in immigration court) and what options they might have to prevent a deportation order.

The DOJ claimed it was “pausing” the legal orientation program to evaluate its effectiveness. But the lead contractor, the Vera Institute for Justice, says they received an email from DOJ telling them “there is not intent that the program will be renewed.”

The Vera Institute was blindsided — not least because the legal orientation program had been evaluated in 2012, and found to make the system more efficient. Because immigrants weren’t fighting hopeless cases, court cases took an average of 12 fewer days to resolve and the government saved an average of six nights in detention costs — for a total savings of $17.8 million a year over and above the cost of administering the orientation.

“This seems totally contrary to the Department of Justice’s interests,” Oren Root of Vera told Vox in April. “Their biggest problem, from their point of view, is getting cases concluded. And here is a tool that is proven by their own study to be effective in doing that.”

The DOJ reversed its decision to suspend legal orientations under pressure from members of Congress. But it re-evaluated the program’s effectiveness — and found, in a report with what the Vera Institute called “insurmountable flaws,” that it was actually a cost-waster for the federal government.

There’s a similar pattern in the cases that Sessions referred to himself for review from the Board of Immigration Appeals, a tactic he used aggressively in the second half of his short tenure. In May, Sessions ruled that judges couldn’t move cases off their docket by closing them without a deportation order — and opened the door to the reopening of 350,000 cases that had already been closed this way.

Sessions proceeded to put severe constraints on judges’ ability to grant asylum to victims of violence from non-state actors (like domestic abusers or gangs), and limit judges’ abilities to delay a hearing to let the immigrant apply for legal status elsewhere. At the time of his resignation, his office was working on new opinions in cases regarding whether asylum-seekers had the right to a bond hearing and whether judges could dismiss their cases without a hearing at all.

All these changes, and threatened changes, to immigration courts would create a ratchet. Judges would have to get through more cases due to the “performance measures,” without being able to move cases off their docket by closing them — their primary tool of docket control over the past few years. They’d have to make rulings in asylum cases more quickly, without giving immigrants time to present evidence, and without being able to grant asylum on the basis of domestic violence. They’d have to find time for hopeless cases that immigrants might not have tried to fight if they had gone through “legal orientation” — taking time away from cases immigrants could actually win if given the chance.

What was the suit about?

The lawsuit claimed that Clinton ""carelessly and recklessly impugned"" Gabbard's reputation during an October podcast interview

The lawsuit began:

Tulsi Gabbard is running for President of the United States, a position Clinton has long coveted, but has not been able to attain. In October 2019—whether out of personal animus, political enmity, or fear of real change within a political party Clinton and her allies have long dominated—Clinton lied about her perceived rival Tulsi Gabbard. She did so publicly, unambiguously, and with obvious malicious intent. Tulsi has been harmed by Clinton's lies—and American democracy has suffered as well.

It is critical to the rule of law that Mr . Sessions stay right where he is . We are heartened that he refused to budge , and we hope he will continue to do so . He has satisfied honor by submitting his resignation once before . He need not do it again . Let Mr. Trump fire him if he dares .
First , the Russia investigation continues to hang over the president . Firing Mr . Sessions would be perceived as an effort to replace him with an attorney general who is not conflicted out of the investigation and capable of taking control of it for Mr. Trump . Doing so would create a firestorm , and keep the investigation in the news longer .
Then there is the question of legal liability for the president . A Sessions firing might , like the termination of James Comey , the former F.B.I . director , be viewed by Mr. Mueller as possible obstruction of justice . That is especially true if the special counsel is , as has been reported , already investigating the president ’ s July attempt to oust Mr . Sessions .
Firing Mr . Sessions would also jeopardize the president ’ s relationship with Senate Republicans . Senators Jeff Flake , Bob Corker and John McCain have already publicly broken ranks with the president on various matters . There are others , like Senators Charles Grassley and Lindsey Graham , whose loyalty to Mr . Sessions , their former colleague , likely runs deeper than their allegiance to the president . He is counting on Senate Republicans to serve as a firewall against the Russia investigation and much more . A Sessions firing would most likely breach it .
Finally , there would be agonizing choices to be made when it comes to selecting a replacement . If Mr . Sessions is fired , President Trump will have a hard time finding someone with the integrity required to earn Senate confirmation and the proven personal loyalty he demands .
And therein lies the problem . At the end of the day , Jeff Sessions is no Roy Cohn . He is a man of integrity who may serve at the pleasure of the president , but this week he demonstrated his fealty to the rule of law and the Constitution . We urge him to stay in his job and continue to defend the Department of Justice — and our nation — against continued attempts to politicize federal law enforcement .","This is no mere personnel flap.

It is critical to the rule of law that Mr. Sessions stay right where he is. We are heartened that he refused to budge, and we hope he will continue to do so. He has satisfied honor by submitting his resignation once before. He need not do it again. Let Mr. Trump fire him if he dares.

The good news is, the president probably won’t.

First, the Russia investigation continues to hang over the president. Firing Mr. Sessions would be perceived as an effort to replace him with an attorney general who is not conflicted out of the investigation and capable of taking control of it for Mr. Trump. Doing so would create a firestorm, and keep the investigation in the news longer.

Then there is the question of legal liability for the president. A Sessions firing might, like the termination of James Comey, the former F.B.I. director, be viewed by Mr. Mueller as possible obstruction of justice. That is especially true if the special counsel is, as has been reported, already investigating the president’s July attempt to oust Mr. Sessions.

Firing Mr. Sessions would also jeopardize the president’s relationship with Senate Republicans. Senators Jeff Flake, Bob Corker and John McCain have already publicly broken ranks with the president on various matters. There are others, like Senators Charles Grassley and Lindsey Graham, whose loyalty to Mr. Sessions, their former colleague, likely runs deeper than their allegiance to the president. He is counting on Senate Republicans to serve as a firewall against the Russia investigation and much more. A Sessions firing would most likely breach it.

Finally, there would be agonizing choices to be made when it comes to selecting a replacement. If Mr. Sessions is fired, President Trump will have a hard time finding someone with the integrity required to earn Senate confirmation and the proven personal loyalty he demands.

And therein lies the problem. At the end of the day, Jeff Sessions is no Roy Cohn. He is a man of integrity who may serve at the pleasure of the president, but this week he demonstrated his fealty to the rule of law and the Constitution. We urge him to stay in his job and continue to defend the Department of Justice — and our nation — against continued attempts to politicize federal law enforcement.",www.nytimes.com,left,H6KUMVRuvaR9HDx7

A special counsel is a prosecutor who is appointed by the Department of Justice to independently investigate a potential crime to avoid any conflict of interest .

Mueller is empowered to conduct his investigation with minimal day-to-day oversight so long as he adheres to the `` rules , regulations , procedures , practices and policies '' of the Department .

'' Also , because the rules governing special counsels have been judged to `` not have the force and effect of law , '' the Department of Justice , acting under President Trump 's orders , could theoretically just abolish the rules altogether and fire Mueller without cause .
The short answer is `` a bunch . '' The longer answer is that there have been different types of special counsels in American history with different titles . To cite perhaps the most famous example , Ken Starr was appointed an `` independent counsel '' in accordance with the Ethics in Government Act ( EGA ) of 1978 .
The EGA was a post-Watergate reform , and Starr was appointed by and reported to a panel of judges to investigate the Whitewater scandal .

Glad you asked. A special counsel is a prosecutor who is appointed by the Department of Justice to independently investigate a potential crime to avoid any conflict of interest. This is the job that former FBI Director Robert Mueller has been appointed to, and he will have the full authority of a U.S. attorney to prosecute any crimes that arise from his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Mueller is empowered to conduct his investigation with minimal day-to-day oversight so long as he adheres to the ""rules, regulations, procedures, practices and policies"" of the Department. But the attorney general, or in this case Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosensein, could prevent him perusing a prosecution or other major action, although he'd have to explain to Congress his reasoning in doing so (Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the Russia probe.).

Rosenstein could also fire Mueller ""for misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or for other good cause."" Also, because the rules governing special counsels have been judged to ""not have the force and effect of law,"" the Department of Justice, acting under President Trump's orders, could theoretically just abolish the rules altogether and fire Mueller without cause.

How many special counsels have we had before this?

The short answer is ""a bunch."" The longer answer is that there have been different types of special counsels in American history with different titles. To cite perhaps the most famous example, Ken Starr was appointed an ""independent counsel"" in accordance with the Ethics in Government Act (EGA) of 1978.

The EGA was a post-Watergate reform, and Starr was appointed by and reported to a panel of judges to investigate the Whitewater scandal. The EGA, which Congress eventually judged to be more trouble than it was worth after the lengthy investigations into Iran-Contra and Watergate, was allowed to expire 1999. After that, the Department of Justice cooked up a new round of rules governing the appointment of a special counsel.

Mueller is the third special counsel to be appointed since its expiration. He is specifically tasked with investigating ""any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump."" He also has the authority to look into ""any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.""

How long do these investigations typically take?

Special prosecutor Archibald Cox's investigation into Watergate lasted only 150 days before Acting Attorney General Robert Bork fired him on orders from President Richard Nixon. The EGA was passed to make these investigations more independent in the future.

On the other end of the spectrum, the investigation into former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development lasted more than a decade. But according to Phillip Bump at The Washington Post, the average length of one of these investigations is 1,154 days, a number that drops to 911 days when you exclude the uniquely long one into Cisneros.

How long will Mueller's investigation take?

It will likely take years, if past investigations are any guide.

And how much will it cost?

It's impossible to put a price tag on the investigation at this stage. Ken Starr's sprawling Whitewater investigation lasted six years and cost over $50 million. Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh's investigation into Iran-Contra, meanwhile, cost $47.4 million.

Other more minor investigations have cost far less, but it's safe to assume that the eventual bill for Mueller's efforts will be in the millions, if not tens of millions.",www.cbsnews.com,left,KQXTvC3eMV4xk6Nb
