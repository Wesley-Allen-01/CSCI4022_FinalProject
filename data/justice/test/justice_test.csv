Do you remember Lewis “Scooter” Libby?

In 2003, the Department of Justice appointed a special counsel to investigate allegations that Libby, Vice President Dick Cheney’s chief of staff, unlawfully disclosed the covert status of CIA operative Valerie Plame.

Yet Ms. Plame may not have been a covert undercover agent, based on the formal government definition of that role. And even if she were, it was widely known at the time that Secretary of State Colin Powell’s subordinate, Richard Armitage, had most likely disclosed her status earlier.

In other words, Libby was in an Orwellian position of being accused of a crime that may not have existed. But if it had, it was more likely committed by someone else.

Publicity-seeking Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald convinced a Washington, D.C. jury to find Libby guilty of obstruction of justice, perjury and making false statements to federal investigators — not the supposed crimes for which he was originally targeted by the media.

Apparently, the very suspicion of improper behavior by high public servants once warranted vigorous legal inquiry — by supposedly independent and autonomous prosecutors.

In the eight-plus years since the Libby trial, the Obama administration has blown up the law as we have known it for centuries.

Barack Obama once warned Latino activists that he had no legal authority to suspend enforcement of federal immigration law, stop deportations and offer de facto amnesties.

But that caution was only a campaigning talking point. After his re-election in 2012 and the midterm elections in 2014, President Obama made a mockery of immigration law.

Hundreds of liberal sanctuary cities have announced that federal immigration law does not apply to them. That scary, neo-Confederate idea of legal nullification was sanctioned by the Obama administration — in a way it never would have been if a city had suspended the Endangered Species Act, emissions standards or gun-control legislation.

As a result, once-detained and later-released immigrants with criminal records have murdered innocent American citizens.

Consider the proposed nuclear deal with Iran. By past custom and practice, the nonproliferation agreement would be treated as what it is — a treaty.

But ratifying treaties constitutionally requires 67 yes votes from the Senate. Mr. Obama could never obtain that margin. So he managed to downgrade the treaty into a mere legal agreement. Then he claimed that the Senate required 67 no votes to override his veto.

Mr. Obama also was worried about the political impact of his new Obamacare legislation on the 2014 midterm elections. So he simply suspended by executive fiat the employer mandate of the Affordable Care Act. Had another president done that to the laws of Obamacare, the left would have demanded impeachment.

In Ferguson, Mo., law enforcement eased off and allowed a city to burn. But the cause of the rioting — the supposed improper police killing of criminal suspect Michael Brown — was based on the lie that Brown was shot with his hands up. No matter. The ensuing public outrage seemingly exempted arsonists and looters from arrest.

Just as scary is the application of the law on the basis of the perceived politics of a suspect.

Internal Revenue Service bureaucrat Lois Lerner was exposed as a rank partisan whose office gave particular scrutiny to would-be tax-exempt groups deemed opponents of Mr. Obama’s re-election efforts. She invoked the Fifth Amendment and refused to testify before a congressional committee about her actions at the IRS. Ms. Lerner has never been indicted.

Almost everything former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has stated about her improper use of a private email account and server has been proven false. A State Department staffer who worked on Mrs. Clinton’s private server plans to invoke the Fifth Amendment to avoid testifying before a congressional committee about his role in privatizing her email.

But like Ms. Lerner, Mrs. Clinton has escaped an indictment or jailing.

Not so Kim Davis. She is a conservative Christian court clerk in Kentucky who apparently thought, given the lawless times, that she could ignore without consequence a Supreme Court decision making gay marriage legal.

Ms. Davis was jailed for not enforcing the law. That is a justifiable punishment — if it were applied equally to the progressive mayors of sanctuary cities and all officials who likewise ignore federal law.

The most likely culprit of the preplanned Benghazi attack was not scapegoat Mr. Nakoula, but the inconvenient pre-election truth that al Qaeda was quite alive in Libya and U.S. security quite lax.

justice,Newsmax,2,http://www.newsmax.com/Politics/Sessions-Writing-Questions-Russia/2017/03/03/id/776847/,DOJ: Sessions to Respond in Writing to Questions Over Russia Contacts,2017-03-03,,"U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions will reply in writing to Senate Democrats ' questions about his meetings with Russia 's ambassador last year , the Justice Department said on Friday after a top Republican denied Democrats ' request for a public hearing .
Nine Democratic senators sent a letter earlier Friday asking Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley to call Sessions before his panel to explain his failure until this week to disclose his contacts with the Russian ambassador during the 2016 presidential campaign .
The letter came a day after Sessions , the country 's top justice official and a key ally of Republican President Donald Trump , removed himself from any investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the election .
Grassley replied that he had no plans for a hearing .
Instead , Sessions on Monday will submit written answers to questions posed in the Democratic lawmakers ' letter , such as why he did not come forward sooner to detail his communications with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak , Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr said .
On Thursday , Sessions said he met Kislyak in his Senate office two months before the election as well as at an event with other ambassadors at the Republican National Convention .
During the Senate confirmation process to become attorney general , Sessions denied having any contact with Russian officials during the campaign .
Sessions told reporters he had done nothing wrong by failing to disclose the contact with Kislyak . The Washington Post first disclosed the meetings on Wednesday .
Many Democrats , who are pushing for a broad probe of ties between Trump campaign associates and Russian operatives , called for Sessions to resign .
Trump , however , has backed his attorney general and accused Democrats of blowing the issue out of proportion for political purposes .
On Friday , he accused Chuck Schumer , the top Democrat in the Senate , of double standards for having met Russian President Vladimir Putin himself .
`` We should start an immediate investigation into @ SenSchumer and his ties to Russia and Putin . A total hypocrite ! '' Trump said in a tweet that included what appeared to be an old picture of Schumer and Putin smiling as they ate donuts .
Schumer , who has called for Sessions ' resignation , responded in a tweet that he was willing to swear under oath that his contact with Putin and the Russian leader 's associates occurred in 2003 and in public with the media present .
Two U.S. officials , speaking on condition of anonymity on Thursday , said Sessions was one of many subjects of a government investigation of any contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia .
While there is nothing legally wrong with such meetings , the reported contacts raise questions about the White House 's statements that it knew of no further communications with Russian officials beyond those by ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn , who was fired last month .
The Russia controversy has dogged the early days of the Trump administration and threatens to obscure its push to cut taxes , repeal the Obamacare healthcare law and deal with other top domestic priorities .
Democratic senators including Dianne Feinstein and Richard Blumenthal said in their letter that Sessions ' decision to step back from campaign-related investigations was welcome . But they said his previous answers to questions about Russia were `` incomplete and misleading . ''
`` Given the seriousness of this matter , we do not believe that a written submission to correct the record is sufficient , '' they said in the letter .
U.S. intelligence agencies concluded last year that Russia hacked and leaked Democratic emails during the election campaign as part of an effort to tilt the vote in Trump 's favor . The Kremlin has denied the allegations .
On Friday , Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the controversy looked like `` a witch hunt , '' the RIA news agency reported .
Trump called frequently during his campaign for improved relations with Russia , which have been deeply strained in recent years over Moscow 's military interference in Ukraine , its support for President Bashar al-Assad in Syria and Putin 's intolerance of political dissent .
With his administration on the defensive over Russia , Trump 's enthusiasm seems to have cooled , and his top foreign policy advisers have begun talking tougher about Moscow .","U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions will reply in writing to Senate Democrats' questions about his meetings with Russia's ambassador last year, the Justice Department said on Friday after a top Republican denied Democrats' request for a public hearing.

The letter came a day after Sessions, the country's top justice official and a key ally of Republican President Donald Trump, removed himself from any investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the election.

Grassley replied that he had no plans for a hearing.

Instead, Sessions on Monday will submit written answers to questions posed in the Democratic lawmakers' letter, such as why he did not come forward sooner to detail his communications with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak, Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr said.

On Thursday, Sessions said he met Kislyak in his Senate office two months before the election as well as at an event with other ambassadors at the Republican National Convention.

During the Senate confirmation process to become attorney general, Sessions denied having any contact with Russian officials during the campaign.

Sessions told reporters he had done nothing wrong by failing to disclose the contact with Kislyak. The Washington Post first disclosed the meetings on Wednesday.

Many Democrats, who are pushing for a broad probe of ties between Trump campaign associates and Russian operatives, called for Sessions to resign.

Trump, however, has backed his attorney general and accused Democrats of blowing the issue out of proportion for political purposes.

On Friday, he accused Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the Senate, of double standards for having met Russian President Vladimir Putin himself.

""We should start an immediate investigation into @SenSchumer and his ties to Russia and Putin. A total hypocrite!"" Trump said in a tweet that included what appeared to be an old picture of Schumer and Putin smiling as they ate donuts.

Schumer, who has called for Sessions' resignation, responded in a tweet that he was willing to swear under oath that his contact with Putin and the Russian leader's associates occurred in 2003 and in public with the media present.

'WITCH HUNT'

Two U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity on Thursday, said Sessions was one of many subjects of a government investigation of any contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia.

While there is nothing legally wrong with such meetings, the reported contacts raise questions about the White House's statements that it knew of no further communications with Russian officials beyond those by ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn, who was fired last month.

The Russia controversy has dogged the early days of the Trump administration and threatens to obscure its push to cut taxes, repeal the Obamacare healthcare law and deal with other top domestic priorities.

Democratic senators including Dianne Feinstein and Richard Blumenthal said in their letter that Sessions' decision to step back from campaign-related investigations was welcome. But they said his previous answers to questions about Russia were ""incomplete and misleading.""

""Given the seriousness of this matter, we do not believe that a written submission to correct the record is sufficient,"" they said in the letter.

U.S. intelligence agencies concluded last year that Russia hacked and leaked Democratic emails during the election campaign as part of an effort to tilt the vote in Trump's favor. The Kremlin has denied the allegations.

On Friday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the controversy looked like ""a witch hunt,"" the RIA news agency reported.

Trump called frequently during his campaign for improved relations with Russia, which have been deeply strained in recent years over Moscow's military interference in Ukraine, its support for President Bashar al-Assad in Syria and Putin's intolerance of political dissent.

President Trump has fired Acting Attorney General Sally Yates, concluding she has ""betrayed the Department of Justice"" by refusing to defend his executive order that imposes a temporary ban on refugees and visa holders from seven majority-Muslim countries.

In a statement, the White House called Yates, an Obama administration holdover with 27 years of experience prosecuting corrupt public officials and the man who bombed the Atlanta Olympic park, ""weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration.""

“Double standard?” President Donald Trump guffawed after Fox News anchor Ainsley Earhardt asked whether federal law enforcement has a double standard for how it handles allegations of wrongdoing by Republicans and Democrats.

Trump had a little list of big disparities.

For starters, Trump named “Awan,” as in Imran Awan, a former House Democratic IT staffer who pleaded guilty to one count of lying on a loan application and was sentenced Tuesday in a federal court in Washington.

The same day, a federal jury in Virginia found former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort guilty of five counts of tax fraud, two counts of bank fraud, and one count of failing to disclose foreign bank accounts. The charges stemmed from special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election, even though they had nothing to do with the 2016 campaign or Russia.

A Republican, 69-year-old Manafort faces up to 30 years in prison just for each of the two convictions for obtaining huge loans based on false information.

Meanwhile, a federal judge sentenced Awan to time served — one day of detention and 11 months of GPS monitoring, according to the Washington Post — and three months of supervision for a similar offense.

“He got nothing,” Trump complained to Fox News.

The difference? Manafort’s liar loans were in the millions; Awan’s ill-gotten loan was in the low six figures. Manafort pleaded not guilty. Awan pleaded guilty and hence received a lesser sentence, no prison.

One more difference: The Republican was a target of the special counsel’s.

Awan was the subject of conservative-media stories that questioned why Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., kept him on the payroll after he lost computer access because of alleged breaches of security protocol in February 2017, could no longer do his job, and had been fired by most other Democratic House members.

Trump remains baffled that Mueller’s team is overturning every rock around the president to find collusion between his campaign and Russia while ignoring ties between Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the Democratic Party and the author of a so-called dossier of dirt on Trump from Russian sources.

“Both sides got information from the Russians,” said Saikrishna Prakash of the University of Virginia’s Miller Center.

One thing I learned at Manafort’s trial is that Rick Gates, Manafort’s former right-hand man who reached a plea agreement in return for his testimony, met with the FBI in 2014 to discuss payments received when the two men were advising Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych before he fled Kiev that year.

Gates testified that he told the FBI about offshore accounts. He also said that the agents, who were trying to recover looted assets, told him that neither he nor Manafort was under investigation.

That’s right. The FBI knew about Manafort’s offshore accounts — which enabled Manafort to avoid millions in taxes — and did nothing.

Until the special counsel got into the act.

On Fox News Channel, Trump also belittled his former personal attorney Michael Cohen, another Mueller target, for “flipping” — agreeing to testify against others (namely, Trump) in exchange for a reduced sentence.

Documents released by federal prosecutors Tuesday include no stipulation that Cohen will testify against Trump. Still, by agreeing to plead guilty to eight counts, including two charges that involved the Trump campaign, Cohen won a lid of 63 months in prison.

Those counts include bank fraud — which could carry 30-year terms for Manafort. Trump argued that the two counts of campaign finance violations are bogus, that Cohen’s payments to buy the silence of two women who said they had sexual relations with Trump had nothing to do with his 2016 campaign.

Jurors found Manafort guilty because a trail of emails nailed him to clearly criminal behavior. Some of this behavior was dangled in front of the FBI in 2014 — and nothing ensued.

When the special counsel focused on Manafort, he charged him with five counts of tax fraud, four counts of failing to report foreign bank accounts, and nine bank fraud counts. If he had been convicted on all 18 counts, Manafort would have faced 365 years in prison. Having been convicted on eight counts, the 69-year-old is looking at 80 years.

Is there a person in America who thinks that 80 years is a fitting sentence for a batch of venal but nonviolent crimes by a first-time offender?

Actually, there are many. They’re called federal prosecutors. They are the same folks who defend life-without-parole sentences for first-time low-level drug offenders. They look at federal sentencing rules that let them put away fraudsters for 30 years on one bank fraud count and they think it’s their destiny to deliver. Unless they decide not to.

She made an honest mistake when she instructed the entire Justice Department not to defend President Trump ’ s wrong-headed executive order on immigration . The reasons she gave in her letter referred to matters beyond the scope of the attorney general . She criticized the order on policy grounds and said that it was not “ right . ”
She also referred to its possibly being unconstitutional and unlawful . Had she stuck to the latter two criteria she would have been on more solid ground , although perhaps wrong on the merits . But by interjecting issues of policy and directing the Justice Department not to defend any aspect of the order , she overstepped her bounds .
An attorney general , like any citizen , has the right to disagree with a presidential order , but unless it is clear that the order is unlawful , she has no authority to order the Justice Department to refuse to enforce it . This order is multifaceted and complex . It raises serious constitutional and legal issues that deserved nuanced and calibrated consideration from the nation ’ s highest law officer .
There are significant differences between the constitutional status of green card holders on the one hand , and potential visitors from another country who are seeking visas . Moreover , there are statutory issues in addition to constitutional ones . A blanket order to refuse to defend any part of the statute is overkill . If she strongly disagreed with the policies underlying the order , she should have resigned in protest , and left it to others within the Justice Department to defend those parts of the order that are legally defensible .
I , too , disagree , with the policy underlying the order , but I don ’ t immediately assume that any policy with which I disagree is automatically unconstitutional or unlawful .

The president has considerable constitutional authority to control entry into the United States by non-citizens and non-residents . Congress , too , has some degree of control over our borders . The precise relationship between presidential and congressional power has never been defined by the Supreme Court . A responsible attorney general would seek to analyze these complex issues before jumping into the political fire with a blanket refusal to defend any part of the order .
In addition to failing to do her duty as attorney general , Sally Yates handed President Trump Donald John TrumpTrump faces high stakes in meeting with Erdoğan amid impeachment drama Democrats worry they do n't have right candidate to beat Trump Trump threatening to fire Mulvaney : report MORE an underserved political victory . She gave him the power to control the situation by firing her , instead of herself maintaining control by resigning in protest . It is the president who emerges from this unnecessary confrontation with the undeserved status of hero among his constituents .
I do not know Sally Yates except by reputation . She is highly regarded as a career prosecutor and public servant . My criticism of her is not personal , but rather institutional . These are dangerous and delicate times , and anyone who wants to confront the newly elected president must do so with wisdom , nuance and calibration . She played directly into his hands by responding to an overbroad order with overbroad response .
. @ POTUS has named Dana Boente , US Attorney for the Eastern District of VA as Acting Attorney General . Sally Yates has been relieved . — Sean Spicer ( @ PressSec ) January 31 , 2017
President Trump has now appointed a new acting attorney general who will defend the order , or at least those parts of it that are legally defensible . Any individual Justice Department official who feels uncomfortable defending this controversial order should be given the freedom by the department to decline to participate in the case .
There are plenty of good lawyers in the department who would have no hesitation standing up in the courtroom and making the best ethically permissible argument in defense of the order . I have had many experiences with Justice Department lawyers who personally disagreed with the prosecutorial decision in particular cases , but who vigorously defended the government ’ s position .
Sally Yates did what she thought was right . In my view she was wrong . She should neither be lionized nor accused of betrayal . Nor should President Trump ’ s critics , and I include myself among them , accuse him of doing anything even remotely close to President Nixon ’ s infamous “ Saturday Night Massacre. ” Nixon fired the very officials who were seeking to prosecute him . That constituted a personal and unethical conflict of interest . President Trump fired Yates over policy differences . It may have been unwise for him to do so , but it was clearly within his authority .
Now we will see our adversarial system at work . Excellent and dedicated lawyers will continue to bring challenges throughout the country against this ill-advised executive order . Other excellent lawyers will defend the order vigorously in court . Ultimately the issue may come to the Supreme Court , with or without a full complement of justices .

She made an honest mistake when she instructed the entire Justice Department not to defend President Trump’s wrong-headed executive order on immigration. The reasons she gave in her letter referred to matters beyond the scope of the attorney general. She criticized the order on policy grounds and said that it was not “right.”

She also referred to its possibly being unconstitutional and unlawful. Had she stuck to the latter two criteria she would have been on more solid ground, although perhaps wrong on the merits. But by interjecting issues of policy and directing the Justice Department not to defend any aspect of the order, she overstepped her bounds.

An attorney general, like any citizen, has the right to disagree with a presidential order, but unless it is clear that the order is unlawful, she has no authority to order the Justice Department to refuse to enforce it. This order is multifaceted and complex. It raises serious constitutional and legal issues that deserved nuanced and calibrated consideration from the nation’s highest law officer.

There are significant differences between the constitutional status of green card holders on the one hand, and potential visitors from another country who are seeking visas. Moreover, there are statutory issues in addition to constitutional ones. A blanket order to refuse to defend any part of the statute is overkill. If she strongly disagreed with the policies underlying the order, she should have resigned in protest, and left it to others within the Justice Department to defend those parts of the order that are legally defensible.

I, too, disagree, with the policy underlying the order, but I don’t immediately assume that any policy with which I disagree is automatically unconstitutional or unlawful.

The president has considerable constitutional authority to control entry into the United States by non-citizens and non-residents. Congress, too, has some degree of control over our borders. The precise relationship between presidential and congressional power has never been defined by the Supreme Court. A responsible attorney general would seek to analyze these complex issues before jumping into the political fire with a blanket refusal to defend any part of the order.

In addition to failing to do her duty as attorney general, Sally Yates handed President Trump Donald John TrumpTrump faces high stakes in meeting with Erdoğan amid impeachment drama Democrats worry they don't have right candidate to beat Trump Trump threatening to fire Mulvaney: report MORE an underserved political victory. She gave him the power to control the situation by firing her, instead of herself maintaining control by resigning in protest. It is the president who emerges from this unnecessary confrontation with the undeserved status of hero among his constituents.

I do not know Sally Yates except by reputation. She is highly regarded as a career prosecutor and public servant. My criticism of her is not personal, but rather institutional. These are dangerous and delicate times, and anyone who wants to confront the newly elected president must do so with wisdom, nuance and calibration. She played directly into his hands by responding to an overbroad order with overbroad response.

.@POTUS has named Dana Boente, US Attorney for the Eastern District of VA as Acting Attorney General. Sally Yates has been relieved. — Sean Spicer (@PressSec) January 31, 2017

President Trump has now appointed a new acting attorney general who will defend the order, or at least those parts of it that are legally defensible. Any individual Justice Department official who feels uncomfortable defending this controversial order should be given the freedom by the department to decline to participate in the case.

There are plenty of good lawyers in the department who would have no hesitation standing up in the courtroom and making the best ethically permissible argument in defense of the order. I have had many experiences with Justice Department lawyers who personally disagreed with the prosecutorial decision in particular cases, but who vigorously defended the government’s position.

Sally Yates did what she thought was right. In my view she was wrong. She should neither be lionized nor accused of betrayal. Nor should President Trump’s critics, and I include myself among them, accuse him of doing anything even remotely close to President Nixon’s infamous “Saturday Night Massacre.” Nixon fired the very officials who were seeking to prosecute him. That constituted a personal and unethical conflict of interest. President Trump fired Yates over policy differences. It may have been unwise for him to do so, but it was clearly within his authority.

Now we will see our adversarial system at work. Excellent and dedicated lawyers will continue to bring challenges throughout the country against this ill-advised executive order. Other excellent lawyers will defend the order vigorously in court. Ultimately the issue may come to the Supreme Court, with or without a full complement of justices. That is the way our system of checks and balances is supposed to work.

“ The verdict was returned Friday by a Manhattan federal jury after it deliberated charges of attempted extortion and honest services fraud in what prosecutors say was an attempt by Avenatti to extort up to $ 25 million from Nike with threats to otherwise harm it , ” The Associated Press reported . “ The charges carry a combined potential penalty of 42 years in prison . ”
Avenatti , who gained notoriety by attacking President Donald Trump , was charged in March 2019 after he threatened to publicly accuse the company of illegally paying amateur athletes unless Nike paid him .
When Avenatti was charged , Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S.

Avenatti still faces two additional criminal trials for allegedly stealing his former client Stormy Daniels ’ book advance and for allegedly committing fraud in California .
The allegations of fraud in California are particularly disturbing because of who he is accused of defrauding .
In a sweeping expansion of the criminal charges against Michael Avenatti , a federal grand jury has indicted the Los Angeles lawyer on 36 counts of fraud , perjury , failure to pay taxes , embezzlement and other financial crimes . … One of the clients , Geoffrey Ernest Johnson , was a mentally ill paraplegic on disability who won a $ 4-million settlement of a suit against Los Angeles County . The money was wired to Avenatti in January 2015 , but he hid it from Johnson for years , according to the indictment . In 2017 , Avenatti received $ 2.75 million in proceeds from another client ’ s legal settlement , but concealed that too , the indictment says .

Yet many experts contend that such events are relatively rare in the broader scheme of gun violence in America . Indeed , the Monitor ’ s analysis of crowdsourced data from 2015 suggests that the savage incidents that often capture public imagination diverge from the reality of multiple shootings that take place across the nation every day .
That gap , some say , points to a culture that has developed a stratified sense of what kinds of violence merit attention .
“ The way we talk about mass shootings , you ’ re almost creating two categories : shootings of people that matter a lot and shootings of people who don ’ t matter at all , ” says Eugene O ’ Donnell , a lecturer at the City University of New York ’ s John Jay College of Criminal Justice . “ There ’ s this hierarchy of victims , and we should categorically reject that . ”
The Monitor studied two online databases – Mass Shooting Tracker and the Gun Violence Archive – that employ perhaps the broadest popular definition of “ mass shootings ” : incidents that leave four or more people dead or wounded . Both sites rely on news reports and are unofficial , and are the source of expert dispute over what should constitute a mass shooting .
Still , the two databases together provide a glimpse into that victim hierarchy , and help paint a portrait of the face of gun violence in the US today .
Based on the definition the two sites use , and combining the incidents listed in each , there have been 367 mass shootings reported this year as of Dec. 7 . More than 100 involved only one death , and nearly 160 involved no fatalities at all . The incidents occurred in 47 states and 221 cities .
Unlike San Bernardino , these cases rarely involved assault weapons or radicalized shooters , and many stemmed from trivial circumstances – such as arguments at bars or parties – that escalated into gunfights . Many of the wounded and killed were bystanders , and in many cases the shooter escaped , leaving police with few leads .
Such incidents rarely receive more than a few paragraphs and a follow-up story in a local news site or two . Take the case of Odell Branch , Sr. , a 77-year-old man killed in March . Mr . Branch was watching television in his Chicago home when a stray bullet from an outdoor shootout between rival gangs came in through his window , striking him in the head . The shooting injured three others , including Branch ’ s two great-grandchildren , who were in the room with him .
`` He 's a Christian , he ’ s retired , a pillar of the neighborhood , ” one of Branch ’ s neighbors told the local ABC affiliate at the time . “ A good guy , always good guy , always trying to help . ”
Detectives questioned a few “ persons of interest ” following the incident , but made no arrests .
The same is true of a children ’ s birthday party over Labor Day weekend . The celebration turned tragic when several men opened fire at the front yard of the Charlotte , N.C. , residence following the breaking of a piñata . By the time the shooting stopped , 7-year-old Kevin Antonio Calderon Rodas was dead and three others were wounded .
Locals managed to raise more than $ 4,000 for Kevin ’ s funeral expenses , and police arrested nearly a hundred people following what turned out to be a particularly violent holiday weekend . But no one has answered for Kevin ’ s death , and the story went unnoticed by the rest of the nation .
“ It ’ s a sad state of affairs in the city and our country when a 7-year-old boy can ’ t be free to celebrate a birthday party without being murdered , ” Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Deputy Chief Jeff Estes told The Associated Press .
Some cases do receive more attention than others . The shooting that killed 15-year-old basketball star Armoni Sexton in Paterson , N.J. , in April , for instance , eventually earned coverage in The New York Times . Police even arrested local resident Gregory A. Oliver for the crime , charging him with one count of murder , two counts of attempted murder , and weapons possession .
But by and large such events remain only in the minds of neighbors , family , and friends . Despite receiving national coverage for its brutality , for instance , few remember Joseph Jesse Aldridge , the Missouri man who killed seven people , and then himself , after finding his mother dead of apparently natural causes . His door-to-door rampage , which took place in February , took out nearly 20 percent of the small , rural community of Tyrone .
Part of the reason these events – and hundreds of others – remain unrecognized except by locals is the tendency of the public to feel like such incidents could never happen to them .
“ When the event is familial [ or ] … gang-related , the public can , if you will , put that event at a distance and pretend they ’ re not somehow involved because the event involved a group of people of which the public is not a part , like a family or a gang . ‘ Oh , I don ’ t have to worry about this , ’ ” says Garen Wintemute , director of the Violence Prevention Research Program at the University of California , Davis .
On the other hand , he says , the randomness of mass shootings such as San Bernardino tend to unsettle people and force them to consider the possibility that it could happen to them .
“ There ’ s no connection between the shooter ’ s and the victims , which means anyone could be a victim . I could be a victim , ” Dr. Wintemute says . “ It could happen to me . It could be my holiday party . They don ’ t happen ‘ there , ’ they happen ‘ here. ’ So the public has a direct personal stake . ”
Yet such shootings are relatively anomalous events , says James Alan Fox , a criminologist at Northeastern University in Boston .
In an op-ed for USA Today , Dr. Fox – who limits his definition of mass shootings to those that involve four people or more killed – writes : “ Most people will live their entire life without personally knowing anyone gunned down in a mass killing . For most of us… Mass slaughters , like last week ’ s shooting in San Bernardino , are tragedies we witness on television , not real life . ”
What the media , policymakers , and the public should instead focus on is the issue of gun-related violence as a whole , Fox says .
Because although violent crime in the US has declined over the past two decades , America remains among the worst countries in the world for gun deaths outside of conflict zones : Gunfire fatalities in the US since 1968 outnumber American casualties in all the wars in the country ’ s history .
“ There should be public concern over gun crime generally , ” Fox says in an interview with the Monitor . “ [ Mass shootings are ] the very smallest tip of a huge iceberg . ”
That means discussing guns in a coherent , reasonable way , says Professor O ’ Donnell at John Jay College , who is also a retired New York City police officer and prosecutor .
“ Let ’ s not have a war on legitimate gun owners , ” he says . But “ we have to stipulate that we have an ongoing gun-related , crime emergency that ’ s got to be mitigated . ”
Some researchers say events such as San Bernardino could serve as leverage to tackle the broader problem of gun violence . New research , driven by concern over public mass shootings , could help find solutions for the more common – albeit less alarming – shootings that pockmark everyday American life , Wintemute says .
“ My objective is to take tragedies like this , to take the public ’ s fear and sense of helplessness , and have the public transmute those things into action , ” he says . “ While not minimizing at all the tragedy that has the nation riveted at the moment , we ’ re trying to point out that these tragedies are part of a far larger problem about which we know far too little , and about which we do far too little . ”","To most Americans, last week’s massacre at a holiday party in San Bernardino, Calif., is emblematic of mass shootings in the United States today: violent, random, and perpetrated by radical individuals armed with assault weapons.

And anarchy follows.

In the 1934 romantic movie Death Takes a Holiday, Death assumes human form for three days, and the world turns chaotic.

The same thing happens when the law goes on a vacation. Rules are unenforced or politicized. Citizens quickly lose faith in the legal system. Anarchy follows — ensuring that there can be neither prosperity nor security.

The United States is descending into such an abyss, as politics now seem to govern whether existing laws are enforced.

Sociologists in the 1980s found out that when even minor infractions were ignored — such as the breaking of windows, or vendors walking into the street to hawk wares to motorists in a traffic jam — misdemeanors then spiraled into felonies as lawbreakers become emboldened.

A federal law states that the president can by proclamation “suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.” Yet a federal judge ruled that President Trump cannot do what the law allows in temporarily suspending immigration from countries previously singled out by the Obama administration for their laxity in vetting their emigrants.

NEW YORK (AP) — Britain’s Prince Andrew has provided “zero cooperation” to the American investigators who want to interview him as part of their sex trafficking probe into Jeffrey Epstein, a U.S. prosecutor said Monday.

Speaking at a news conference outside Epstein’s New York mansion, U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said prosecutors and the FBI had contacted Andrew’s lawyers and asked to interview him.

“To date, Prince Andrew has provided zero cooperation,” said Berman, the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan.

Buckingham Palace declined to comment.

Andrew announced last year that he was withdrawing from his royal duties amid renewed public attention on a woman’s claim that she had several sexual encounters with the prince at Epstein’s behest, starting when she was 17.

Virginia Roberts Giuffre says that after meeting Epstein in Florida in 2000, the millionaire flew her around the world and pressured her into having sex with numerous older men, including Andrew, two senior U.S. politicians, a noted academic, wealthy financiers and the attorney Alan Dershowitz, who is now part of President Donald Trump’s impeachment defense team.

All of those men have denied the allegations. Epstein killed himself in his jail cell last summer while he was awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.

Giuffre has said she had sex with Andrew three times, including once in London in 2001 at the home of Epstein’s girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell.

It isn’t clear what legal exposure Andrew might have in the case, if any. The age of consent for sex is 16 in England and 17 in New York. However, Giuffre claims that she was paid by Epstein for her sexual encounters with Andrew. That could constitute a violation of U.S. sex trafficking laws if she was under age 18 or was coerced into unwanted sex acts.

Andrew, who is eight in line for the British throne, and Maxwell have both denied any knowledge that Epstein was sexually abusing teenage girls. In a TV interview last fall, Andrew insisted he was out having pizza with his children on the night Giuffre says they were together in London.

U.S. Attorney General William Barr has vowed to aggressively investigate and bring charges against anyone who may have helped Epstein.

Andrew, in the statement he released in November announcing his intention to “step back from public duties,” said he regretted his “ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein.”

“Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required,” he wrote.

Berman made his remarks about the case during a joint appearance with members of Safe Horizon, a nonprofit victim services agency, to discuss a new New York law that made it easier for people to sue over childhood sexual abuse.

He wouldn’t discuss the Epstein investigation in detail but reiterated that the case didn’t end with his death.

“Jeffrey Epstein couldn’t have done what he did without the assistance of others, and I can assure you that the investigation is moving forward,” Berman said.

But during a pandemic , being within six feet of a stranger—especially for a prolonged period of time in a small , under-ventilated space—can be deadly .
That ’ s why police departments are rapidly changing how they conduct interrogations these days , according to a Marshall Project survey of police chiefs and investigators across the nation . Detectives in Philadelphia , Miami and elsewhere said they are increasingly conducting interviews of suspects , witnesses and victims out in the street and six feet apart , instead of indoors . In Clearwater , Florida , for instance , they ’ re often doing so in the parking lot outside of their station .
And when officers do bring people back to the precinct , many have started questioning people from another room , via Zoom or Skype—or at least from the other end of a large conference table .
This is frustrating to some police who say they rely on physical proximity to intimidate suspects into telling the truth , or to read their facial expressions and eye contact for clues as to whether they are lying . The fact that masks are now largely required during interrogations , some say , is also obstructing this sort of nonverbal information-gathering .
“ We ’ re social animals . We ’ re not wired to communicate at a distance , especially not about sensitive things , ” said Chuck Wexler , executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum , a national organization of law enforcement officials . “ That ’ s why we don ’ t just send suspects a list of written questions ; no serious investigator would operate that way . ”
Yet at a time when , in the wake of the killing of George Floyd , many Americans are calling for an end to the kind of policing that ’ s predicated on force and coercion—especially of Black people—many policing experts say that the social-distancing of interrogations could be a blessing in disguise .
Once , beatings were a legally acceptable interrogation method . More recently , the Reid technique of interviewing has become prevalent , in which detectives start with the assumption of a suspect ’ s guilt and work to corner them , physically and psychologically .
Now , more outdoor interrogations could mean more bystanders ’ eyes on what the interrogators are saying and doing—in other words , more civilian oversight of police . Similarly , more interviews conducted by videoconference between the rooms of a police station should leave little legal excuse for cops not to record the footage , in turn allowing judges and juries to see for themselves whether a confession was fairly obtained . It also allows a department ’ s best interviewer to conduct the interrogation even if he or she can ’ t be there in person .
And more reliance on verbal communication rather than on physical cues like eye contact—which studies have shown police are not as good at reading as they think they are—could actually make detectives better interviewers .
Protesters have been focused on the issue of police use of force out in the community , “ but we ’ ve got to recognize that that same police culture is inside , in the interrogation room , too , ” said James L. Trainum , a former longtime homicide detective in Washington , D.C. , and an expert and consultant on interrogations and confessions . “ It ’ s that same mindset of using physicality instead of really listening to and respecting citizens , and it doesn ’ t build the rapport with people that ’ s needed to actually solve crimes . ”
But between the pandemic and the protests , some law enforcement agencies are already adjusting these practices . As early as mid-March , officers in Miami were weighing the health risks of every potential interrogation , according to Armando R. Aguilar , assistant chief of the Miami Police Department . They are now only bringing suspects inside—into their squad cars and offices—in the most serious cases , including murders , rapes and armed robberies .
“ If it ’ s something like a single auto theft , and we already have the evidence we need , we ’ re foregoing a formal interview , ” Aguilar said .
In Philadelphia , Chief Inspector Frank Vanore says the department ’ s practice now is to conduct many interviews in the field with a body camera recording , in order to preserve people ’ s statements . “ We ’ ll probably continue this practice even after the pandemic is over , because we ’ re getting to question people on the scene when their memory is fresh and before they clam up about coming in to talk to us , ” he said .
The main exception , Vanore noted , is in the most sensitive cases such as those handled by the department ’ s special victims unit , in which interviewees are so vulnerable that they need to come inside to be sure what they are saying is confidential .
Meanwhile , one of the nation ’ s leading interrogation-consulting firms , Wicklander-Zulawski & Associates , which has trained hundreds of thousands of local police and federal agents in interview techniques , says it is accelerating its ongoing transition to teaching more non-confrontational methods of questioning suspects .
Cops were historically trained to invade someone ’ s physical space to increase their anxiety , said Dave Thompson , vice president of operations at Wicklander . “ That style was hopefully already beginning to be eradicated , but what ’ s happening with COVID is accelerating that , ” he said .
Thompson noted that manipulative tactics meant to make interviewees feel physically vulnerable and therefore dependent on their interrogator ’ s mercy are more likely to make them feel they need to make a false confession .
To be sure , there are downsides to the dramatic shift in interview practices going on nationwide . Trying to convince a witness to a traumatizing crime to speak up is clearly more difficult in public than in private . And with victims , being in-person with a detective “ shows them that we care—they can see it in our face , hear it in our voice—that we ’ re engaged with what they went through , ” said Sergeant Reggie Williams of the Hampton Police Division in Virginia .
For suspects , it may become harder to have an attorney present if police are conducting interrogations immediately at a crime scene , or by phone .
What ’ s more , you might think that being interrogated outside the confines of a closed room would give people a greater sense of their right to just walk away . But research by Fabiana Alceste , a psychology professor at Butler University , suggests that many suspects will still feel the “ perception of custody ” even in the current circumstances .
Alceste has conducted experiments in which people in these seemingly “ free ” situations—talking to police openly , not behind locked doors , not handcuffed—still struggle to say no to an authority figure . They don ’ t want to look guilty , and they often don ’ t know their rights .
“ The pandemic may actually heighten the legal tension between what is objectively versus subjectively a situation of officially being in custody , ” she said .
As for the quality of information being gathered in interrogations during the pandemic many police officials said it ’ s too soon to know . Some , including Lieutenant Michael Walek of the Clearwater Police Department in Florida , point out that detectives are taught to present known facts—to tell the suspect that it is known that they were at a certain place at a certain time—and then to see if the person reacts by finger-tapping , toe-tapping , looking away , or getting evasive or angry .
Without those signals , Walek said , it can be more difficult to know where to go with the next question .
Other policing experts counter that this conventional wisdom about interrogations , widely taught at police academies and passed down among cops , is mostly pseudoscience .
“ Police have a confirmation bias going on : They ’ re looking at a suspect as a suspect , ” said Trainum , the expert on interrogation techniques . “ A person could be experiencing anxiety for a completely different reason , like the fact that they are being interrogated by the police . ”
Trainum added that the pandemic may actually offer an opportunity for greater rapport-building in the interrogation setting . Police , he said , could just openly say to suspects , “ Isn ’ t this a pain in the ass that we ’ re trying to have this conversation through masks ? ” in order to get a laugh , start a dialogue and , ultimately , elicit information .","Coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic, criminal justice and immigration.

It’s the way that detectives have extracted confessions from people forever: in a confined interrogation room, getting right up in the suspect’s face.

Meanwhile, one of the nation’s leading interrogation-consulting firms, Wicklander-Zulawski & Associates, which has trained hundreds of thousands of local police and federal agents in interview techniques, says it is accelerating its ongoing transition to teaching more non-confrontational methods of questioning suspects.

Cops were historically trained to invade someone’s physical space to increase their anxiety, said Dave Thompson, vice president of operations at Wicklander. “That style was hopefully already beginning to be eradicated, but what’s happening with COVID is accelerating that,” he said.

Thompson noted that manipulative tactics meant to make interviewees feel physically vulnerable and therefore dependent on their interrogator’s mercy are more likely to make them feel they need to make a false confession.

To be sure, there are downsides to the dramatic shift in interview practices going on nationwide. Trying to convince a witness to a traumatizing crime to speak up is clearly more difficult in public than in private. And with victims, being in-person with a detective “shows them that we care—they can see it in our face, hear it in our voice—that we’re engaged with what they went through,” said Sergeant Reggie Williams of the Hampton Police Division in Virginia.

For suspects, it may become harder to have an attorney present if police are conducting interrogations immediately at a crime scene, or by phone.

What’s more, you might think that being interrogated outside the confines of a closed room would give people a greater sense of their right to just walk away. But research by Fabiana Alceste, a psychology professor at Butler University, suggests that many suspects will still feel the “perception of custody” even in the current circumstances.

Alceste has conducted experiments in which people in these seemingly “free” situations—talking to police openly, not behind locked doors, not handcuffed—still struggle to say no to an authority figure. They don’t want to look guilty, and they often don’t know their rights.

“The pandemic may actually heighten the legal tension between what is objectively versus subjectively a situation of officially being in custody,” she said.

As for the quality of information being gathered in interrogations during the pandemic many police officials said it’s too soon to know. Some, including Lieutenant Michael Walek of the Clearwater Police Department in Florida, point out that detectives are taught to present known facts—to tell the suspect that it is known that they were at a certain place at a certain time—and then to see if the person reacts by finger-tapping, toe-tapping, looking away, or getting evasive or angry.

Without those signals, Walek said, it can be more difficult to know where to go with the next question.

Other policing experts counter that this conventional wisdom about interrogations, widely taught at police academies and passed down among cops, is mostly pseudoscience.

“Police have a confirmation bias going on: They’re looking at a suspect as a suspect,” said Trainum, the expert on interrogation techniques. “A person could be experiencing anxiety for a completely different reason, like the fact that they are being interrogated by the police.”

Trainum added that the pandemic may actually offer an opportunity for greater rapport-building in the interrogation setting. Police, he said, could just openly say to suspects, “Isn’t this a pain in the ass that we’re trying to have this conversation through masks?” in order to get a laugh, start a dialogue and, ultimately, elicit information.",www.themarshallproject.org,center,d3QgGRe21lNqrRaw

The billionaire financier has channeled more than $ 3 million into seven local district-attorney campaigns in six states over the past year — a sum that exceeds the total spent on the 2016 presidential campaign by all but a handful of rival super-donors .
His money has supported African-American and Hispanic candidates for these powerful local roles , all of whom ran on platforms sharing major goals of Soros ’ , like reducing racial disparities in sentencing and directing some drug offenders to diversion programs instead of to trial . It is by far the most tangible action in a progressive push to find , prepare and finance criminal justice reform-oriented candidates for jobs that have been held by longtime incumbents and serve as pipelines to the federal courts — and it has inspired fury among opponents angry about the outside influence in local elections .
“ The prosecutor exercises the greatest discretion and power in the system . It is so important , ” said Andrea Dew Steele , president of Emerge America , a candidate-training organization for Democratic women . “ There ’ s been a confluence of events in the past couple years and all of the sudden , the progressive community is waking up to this . ”
Soros has spent on district attorney campaigns in Florida , Illinois , Louisiana , Mississippi , New Mexico and Texas through a network of state-level super PACs and a national “ 527 ” unlimited-money group , each named a variation on “ Safety and Justice. ” ( Soros has also funded a federal super PAC with the same name . ) Each organization received most of its money directly from Soros , according to public state and federal financial records , though some groups also got donations from nonprofits like the Civic Participation Action Fund , which gave to the Safety and Justice group in Illinois .
The Florida Safety and Justice group just poured nearly $ 1.4 million — all of which came from Soros and his 527 group — into a previously low-budget Democratic primary for state attorney in Central Florida before Tuesday ’ s vote . The group is backing Aramis Ayala , a former public defender and prosecutor , in her campaign against incumbent Jeff Ashton , whose jurisdiction covers over 1.6 million people across two counties in metro Orlando .
One TV ad from Florida Safety and Justice boosts Ayala , touting her “ plan to remove bias so defendants charged with the same crime receive the same treatment , no matter their background or race. ” The Soros-funded group is also attacking Ashton with ads saying he “ got rid of protections that helped ensure equal treatment regardless of background or race . ... Take two similar traffic incidents that happened on the same night . A white man got off with a slap on the wrist , while the black man faces prison . ”
Opponents of Soros ’ favored candidates have laced into the billionaire , saying that his influence has wildly tipped the scales of local elections and even charging that he made residents less safe .
“ As a candidate and citizen of Caddo Parish , if an outsider was that interested in the race , I wanted to know exactly what he had in mind for the criminal justice system if he were to win , ” said Dhu Thompson , a Louisiana attorney who lost a district attorney race to a Soros-backed candidate , James Stewart , in 2015 . Soros gave over $ 930,000 — more than 22 times the local median household income — to the group boosting Stewart .
“ I know some of his troubling opinions on social issues , especially the criminal justice system , ” Thompson said . “ I ’ ve never known him as an individual who was very strong on some of our crime and punishment issues .

The owner of a local eatery said Couch went into the restaurant a couple of times and sat at a table in the back. She said although there are Americans in the area, they don’t tend to eat there.

Initially, Couch and his mother stayed at a resort, Los Tules, downtown by the beach and then moved to the apartment, according to prosecutors.

Mexican prosecutors say the pair was picked up Monday at 6 p.m. local time. An order was issued for his arrest on Dec. 11 and his mother was declared a missing person, officials said. It was not clear how long they had been in Mexico.

Texas officials are convinced that Couch and his mother fled the country in a planned escape, saying in a press conference Tuesday that the mother and son drove their pickup truck across the border into Mexico.

But before Couch left town, said Tarrant County Sheriff Dee Anderson, Couch threw ""something akin to a going away party “ citing an interview with an unspecified source.

Tonya Couch is expected to face charges of hindering apprehension, which could carry a sentence of between two and 10 years behind bars, Tarrant County District Attorney Sharen Wilson said.

Couch has a hearing scheduled for Jan. 19 to determine whether the case will be handled in adult court. If he is treated as a juvenile, the longest sentence he could receive is four months in confinement. He would be released when he turns 19 in April.

If his case is transferred to the adult courts he wouldn’t receive extra time if convicted. If his case is transferred to the adult courts he would likely to serve out the remainder of his original 10-year probation period and will likely have to wear tracking devices, Wilson said.

Attorneys for the Couches released a statement prior to the press conference saying they had not yet heard from them.",www.abcnews.go.com,left,qRMjJm0mFZYiGHEh

In recent weeks, protests calling for police reform have swept the nation and the globe. These protests began with the killing of George Floyd at the hands of law enforcement officers in Minneapolis. Lawmakers have responded with numerous police reforms at the state and federal level, including competing federal proposals from the house and senate.

While data and research emerges on the new reform policies, we’re covering a police reform proposal that’s been debated for the last decade: body cameras on police officers. While many police departments across the country have already adopted body cameras, there are still no consistent policies for when they are required, how videos will be released to the public, and how long footage should be stored.

Today, we will walk through the general benefits and drawbacks of requiring body cameras for on-duty police officers.





What are Body-Worn Cameras (BWCs):

According to Urban Institute, Body-worn cameras (BWCs) are small devices that police officers can affix to their person—in a head-, shoulder-, or chest-mounted position—that can audio and video record their interactions with community members. BWCs have received strong support from the public and, in recent years, increased buy-in from police leadership and officers because of their ability to improve accountability and transparency and enhance the collection of evidence.

BWCs, through their associated recordings, have the potential to both expose discretionary decisions made in the field and subject them to review.

Who’s currently using them?

According to the Police Executive Research Forum, as of 2018 a nationally representative

sample of police agencies estimated that one-third of American law enforcement agencies currently deploy BWCs to some or all of their officers, and an additional 50 percent of agencies have immediate plans to deploy them.

Recent Developments:

Police actions and decisions in the field have been the focus of substantial research. Yet, recent high‐profile incidents of police excessive force have generated greater political and social salience to this matter. Flowing from this have been greater calls for oversight and review of police decisions. Body‐worn cameras (BWCs) are one organizationally based measure that has been strongly advocated to address these concerns.

Billions of dollars are being spent worldwide on the roll-out of body-worn cameras for police officers. With so much at stake, there is an urgent need to understand whether body-cameras are helping police officers and members of the public, and under what conditions they work best.

Today we’ll walk you through some of the research to date.

THE COMMON THREAD:

Laws should be enforced with accountability and reasonable transparency.

FIND YOUR THREAD:

Supporters of BWCs point to the increased transparency in policing that encourages “good” behavior. Opponents argue that videos are an imperfect witness and behavioral impacts are unknown.

WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department is suing the city of Ferguson in an attempt to forcibly overhaul the city’s troubled police and court operations, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Wednesday.

The decision comes hours after city leaders sought to revise a long- negotiated settlement, citing prohibitive costs of executing such a deal.

“There is no cost for constitutional policing,'' Lynch said late Wednesday.

""Painstaking negotiations lasted more than 26 weeks as we sought to remedy literally years of systematic deficiencies,'' she said of the government's action, which followed a public announcement last month of a tentative agreement that the attorney general described as ""both fair and cost-effective . . . Last night, the City Council rejected the consent decree approved by their own negotiators; their decision leaves us no further choice.''

Lynch said the residents of Ferguson have been waiting ""decades for justice,'' having endured civil rights breaches that established a pattern and practice of racially biased policing .

""I think the city of Ferguson had a real opportunity to step forward here,'' a visibly disappointed attorney general said. ""Instead, they have chosen to step in the past.''

Earlier Wednesday, Ferguson Mayor James Knowles signaled that the city was ready to take on the Justice Department in federal court. He defended Ferguson's unanimous decision to revise the agreement by removing language from the agreement, which local leaders asserted, mandated big raises for police officers.

Local leaders also sought to free the city from its obligations under the agreement should Ferguson seek to shutter the police department altogether and enlist another agency to provide public safety services.

""The ball is in their court,"" Knowles said at a hastily called news conference in Ferguson. ""We're sitting and waiting to talk. If they want to threaten legal action, then that's what they're threatening.""

The threat became reality within hours of the mayor's appearance when the Justice lawsuit was filed in a Missouri federal court, alleging local law enforcement conduct routinely violated the Constitution.

""The residents of Ferguson have waited nearly a year for their city to adopt an agreement that would protect their rights and keep them safe,'' Lynch said. ""They have waited nearly a year for their police department to accept rules that would ensure their constitutional rights and that thousands of other police departments follow every day.''

Justice Department threatens legal action against Ferguson

Trump said in his statement that he asked Kushner and Manafort to attend the meeting. He added that he asked Goldstone to send a list of other attendees but ""he never did. As a result, I had no advance knowledge of who would attend.""

According to media reports, there were eight people at the meeting, but today Trump said, ""I only recall seven.""

The meeting was publicly disclosed in early July 2017, and Trump released several differing statements about the meeting before releasing copies of the emails that show the scheduling of the meeting.

Bush 's attorney general , to serve in the same role .
Trump made the announcement while departing the White House for a trip to Missouri . He called Barr `` a terrific man '' and `` one of the most respected jurists in the country . ''
`` I think he will serve with great distinction , '' Trump said .
If confirmed by the Senate , Barr would succeed Attorney General Jeff Sessions , who was forced out by Trump in November following an acrimonious tenure . Sessions ' chief of staff , Matthew Whitaker , is currently serving as acting attorney general .
Trump 's fury at Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia investigation — which helped set in motion the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller — created deep tensions between Trump and his Justice Department . He sometimes puts the word `` Justice '' in quotes when referring to the department in tweets and has railed against its leaders for failing to investigate his 2016 campaign rival , Hillary Clinton , as extensively as he would like .
Democrats will presumably seek reassurances during confirmation proceedings that Barr , who as attorney general would be in a position to oversee Mueller 's investigation , would not do anything to interfere with the probe .
The investigation appears to be showing signs of entering its final stages , prompting a flurry of tweets from the president Thursday and Friday . But an attorney general opposed to the investigation could theoretically move to cut funding or block certain investigative steps .
Barr was attorney general between 1991 and 1993 , serving in the Justice Department at the same Mueller oversaw the department 's criminal division . Barr later worked as a corporate general counsel and is currently of counsel at a prominent international law firm , Kirkland & Ellis LLP .
Still , while in private practice , Barr has occasionally weighed in on hot-button investigative matters in ways that could prompt concerns among Democrats .
He told The New York Times in November 2017 , in a story about Sessions directing his prosecutors to look into actions related Clinton , that `` there is nothing inherently wrong about a president calling for an investigation '' — though Barr also said one should not be launched just because a president wants it .
He also said there was more reason to investigate a uranium deal approved while Clinton was secretary of state in the Obama administration than potential collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign .
`` To the extent it is not pursuing these matters , the department is abdicating its responsibility , '' Barr told the newspaper .
He also wrote an op-ed for The Washington Post in May 2017 defending Trump 's decision to fire former FBI Director James Comey , one of the actions Mueller has been examining for possible obstruction of justice .
He was quoted two months later in a Post story expressing concern that members of Mueller 's team had given contributions to Democratic candidates .
`` In my view , prosecutors who make political contributions are identifying fairly strongly with a political party , '' Barr said . `` I would have liked to see him have more balance on this group . ''
Barr had been on a White House short list of contenders for several weeks , said a person with knowledge of internal discussions who was not authorized to speak publicly . But some inside the White House were concerned that Barr was too aligned with establishment GOP forces .
Trump said Friday Barr had been his `` first choice from Day One . ''","President Donald Trump said Friday he will nominate William Barr, the late President George H.W. Bush's attorney general, to serve in the same role.

Judge after judge used Mr. Trump ’ s comments about Muslims to undercut his travel ban policies , and on Monday a judge in San Francisco used his words about California ’ s sanctuary city policies to support a ruling halting part of the president ’ s policy .
On Tuesday , a federal judge in Maryland cited Mr. Trump ’ s tweets as an example of bad policy-making , even going so far as to put screen captures of three tweets in his opinion halting the president ’ s policy against transgender troops serving in the military .
“ A capricious , arbitrary , and unqualified tweet of new policy does not trump the methodical and systematic review by military stakeholders qualified to understand the ramifications of policy changes , ” Judge Marvin J. Garbis wrote .
The next hurdle for Mr. Trump ’ s prolific pontificating could be his attempt to roll back the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals amnesty , which faces challenges in courts from California to New York .
The president may have undercut his own legal argument in that case by saying he might extend the program beyond the March cutoff date he had set , Michael Mongan , the deputy solicitor general of California , told a federal appeals court this month . That contradicts Attorney General Jeff Sessions , who argues that DACA is illegal .
“ The president of the United States has said that he was the one who made the decision , and he has said that he feels free to revive DACA if Congress doesn ’ t act before March 5 , suggesting a view that it is in fact a lawful program , ” Mr. Mongan told the 9th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals .

She found no firm consensus , however , on what sort of weight judges give a president ’ s words .
Ms. Shaw suggested that one answer would be to look to a president ’ s words when judges are trying to determine the purpose of an executive action but not to rely on them for policy guidance when they clearly are contradicted by the plain language of an executive order or Justice Department arguments .
Josh Blackman , a professor at the South Texas College of Law , said when he filed briefs several years ago arguing that a judge should take note of Mr. Obama ’ s public statements in the case over the 2014 DACA expansion , he struggled to find a clear precedent that courts should look to presidential comments .
Judge Hanen even sought out Mr. Obama ’ s public statements to use as evidence that the president knew he was abusing his executive powers . The 5th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals , which upheld Judge Hanen ’ s ruling blocking Mr. Obama ’ s moves , also cited the president ’ s words as evidence against him .
Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. did the same thing during oral arguments on the case last year , questioning why Mr. Obama repeatedly said he didn ’ t have the power to grant a deportation amnesty to millions of people — and then did just that .
Mr. Obama ’ s attorney replied that the president , a constitutional law professor , must have changed his mind after talking with other lawyers .
Mr. Blackman said the level of value a judge gives a presidential comment should depend on the context .
In the case of the travel ban executive orders , where the law appears to give Mr. Trump broad latitude , if the plain language of his order is clear , then judges shouldn ’ t have tried to pierce the veil and search for ulterior motives , he said .
But in domestic cases , Mr. Blackman said , higher standards of scrutiny apply to presidential actions and looking at presidential statements makes more sense .
“ Alas , Trump ’ s usual incoherent and meandering style of speech , where he disregards all legal particularities , is not a model to establish the government ’ s position , ” Mr. Blackman said . “ My general take is that the statements are fair game , but do not establish the sorts of ‘ silver bullets ’ the judges so far have found . ”
The White House declined to answer questions about the legal troubles stemming from Mr. Trump ’ s verbosity but expressed confidence that the president will prevail in ongoing lawsuits such as defending his decision to phase out DACA .

justice,Fox Online News,2,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/07/20/trump-sets-red-line-for-mueller-on-russia-probe-warns-hell-expose-conflicts.html,"Trump sets red line for Mueller on Russia probe, warns he'll expose 'conflicts'",2017-07-20,,"President Trump ’ s frustration with the Russia probe boiled over in a fiery new interview where he set a red line for Special Counsel Robert Mueller , warning against digging into his family finances beyond the Russia scope and suggesting he ’ ll soon start talking about the ex-FBI director ’ s “ conflicts . ”
The president has regularly complained about the Russia meddling probe , before and after it was placed in the hands of the special counsel . But his comments to The New York Times indicate he ’ s preparing to get even more aggressive in challenging the credibility of the investigation .
Significantly , he said Mueller would cross a red line if he started looking at Trump family finances going beyond any Russia connection .
'' I think that 's a violation . Look , this is about Russia , ” Trump said .
The interview leaves unclear under what circumstances , if any , he might order the Justice Department to fire Mueller . But he complained anew that the special counsel was hiring lawyers who donated to his general election rival Hillary Clinton and called him out for having interviewed for the job to replace ex-FBI Director James Comey just before his appointment .
''He was up here and he wanted the job , '' Trump told the Times .
The president said after Mueller was named , he said to himself , “ 'What the hell is this all about ? ' Talk about conflicts . But he was interviewing for the job . There were many other conflicts that I have n't said , but I will at some point . ''
In the same interview , Trump also issued a remarkable denunciation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions , one of his earliest and staunchest supporters , for having recused himself in the Russia case .
`` How do you take a job and then recuse yourself ? '' Trump asked rhetorically . `` If he would have recused himself before the job , I would have said , 'Thanks , Jeff , but I ’ m not going to take you . ' ''
There was no immediate comment from Sessions , who announced March 2 that he would recuse himself from overseeing the FBI 's investigation into alleged Russian meddling into the 2016 presidential election campaign . Sessions stepped aside after media reports that he had two conversations with Russia 's ambassador to the U.S. and failed to disclose them to Congress during his confirmation process .
In a separate interview with Fox News ’ Martha MacCallum on “ The Story , ” Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein defended his selection of Mueller to lead the probe .
“ I 've got to explain that I made the decision to appoint Director Mueller based upon his reputation . He had an excellent reputation . Really bipartisan support for his integrity , ” he said .
He added , “ I think you have to keep in mind that the point of having a special counsel is to have some degree of independence from the Department of Justice . So Director Mueller 's not reporting to me about individual decisions made in his investigation . … But it also provides some degree of insulation because what we want to be able to do , is at the end of the day , to be able to say that we appointed somebody who was independent , who made independent decisions , and therefore we can have confidence in the result that they reach . ”
This is not the first time Trump has sounded off on the Mueller probe . He told “ Fox & Friends ” last month that Mueller ’ s friendship with Comey is “ very bothersome . ”
He added , “ I can say that the people that have been hired are all Hillary Clinton supporters , some of them worked for Hillary Clinton . ... I mean , the whole thing is ridiculous if you want to know the truth . ”","President Trump’s frustration with the Russia probe boiled over in a fiery new interview where he set a red line for Special Counsel Robert Mueller, warning against digging into his family finances beyond the Russia scope and suggesting he’ll soon start talking about the ex-FBI director’s “conflicts.”

The president has regularly complained about the Russia meddling probe, before and after it was placed in the hands of the special counsel. But his comments to The New York Times indicate he’s preparing to get even more aggressive in challenging the credibility of the investigation.

Significantly, he said Mueller would cross a red line if he started looking at Trump family finances going beyond any Russia connection.

''I think that's a violation. Look, this is about Russia,” Trump said.

The interview leaves unclear under what circumstances, if any, he might order the Justice Department to fire Mueller. But he complained anew that the special counsel was hiring lawyers who donated to his general election rival Hillary Clinton and called him out for having interviewed for the job to replace ex-FBI Director James Comey just before his appointment.

TRUMP BLASTS SESSIONS FOR RECUSAL

''He was up here and he wanted the job,'' Trump told the Times.

The president said after Mueller was named, he said to himself, “'What the hell is this all about?' Talk about conflicts. But he was interviewing for the job. There were many other conflicts that I haven't said, but I will at some point.''

In the same interview, Trump also issued a remarkable denunciation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, one of his earliest and staunchest supporters, for having recused himself in the Russia case.

""How do you take a job and then recuse yourself?"" Trump asked rhetorically. ""If he would have recused himself before the job, I would have said, 'Thanks, Jeff, but I’m not going to take you.'""

There was no immediate comment from Sessions, who announced March 2 that he would recuse himself from overseeing the FBI's investigation into alleged Russian meddling into the 2016 presidential election campaign. Sessions stepped aside after media reports that he had two conversations with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. and failed to disclose them to Congress during his confirmation process.

In a separate interview with Fox News’ Martha MacCallum on “The Story,” Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein defended his selection of Mueller to lead the probe.

“I've got to explain that I made the decision to appoint Director Mueller based upon his reputation. He had an excellent reputation. Really bipartisan support for his integrity,” he said.

He added, “I think you have to keep in mind that the point of having a special counsel is to have some degree of independence from the Department of Justice. So Director Mueller's not reporting to me about individual decisions made in his investigation. … But it also provides some degree of insulation because what we want to be able to do, is at the end of the day, to be able to say that we appointed somebody who was independent, who made independent decisions, and therefore we can have confidence in the result that they reach.”

This is not the first time Trump has sounded off on the Mueller probe. He told “Fox & Friends” last month that Mueller’s friendship with Comey is “very bothersome.”

He added, “I can say that the people that have been hired are all Hillary Clinton supporters, some of them worked for Hillary Clinton. ... I mean, the whole thing is ridiculous if you want to know the truth.”

The New York Times recently hired as a writer and board member Sarah Jeong. The Times knew that in recent years Ms. Jeong had posted a series of unapologetically racist anti-white tweets. She had offered wisdom such as #CancelWhitePeople and expressed hatred for males.

Yet when The Times discovered less graphic versions of such tweets from newly hired technology writer Quinn Norton earier this year, the newspaper immediately fired Ms. Norton.

The message of disparate treatment was that what bothers The New York Times is not racism per se, but who is the racist and who are her targets.

Over at The Atlantic, there are also no ostensible rules concerning who is and is not fired, and for what reason. Essayist Kevin Williamson was allegedly dropped by Atlantic for his prior incendiary suggestion that abortion might warrant the death penalty.

Fine, it is a free country, and private companies can fire whomever they chose. But The Atlantic had no problem hiring writer Julia Ioffe. She’s been let go at Politico for tweeting that President Trump might have engaged in incest with daughter Ivanka.

Again, the impression conveyed is that The Atlantic is not so concerned with inflammatory speech as with calibrating at whom the venom is directed. If Ms. Ioffe had tweeted the same perversities about Barack Obama and his daughters, The Atlantic surely would have fired her immediately.

The American people are losing confidence in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation not just because after 15 months, he has not charged anyone with Russian collusion — the original reason he was appointed. Instead, the push-back is due to the growing sense that rules are made up ad hoc.

Mr. Mueller is investigating suspects for lying to federal officials, improperly lobbying foreign interests, obstructing justice and violating federal statutes. Yet his team only seems concerned with those crimes to the degree that Donald Trump might be implicated. Otherwise, Mr. Mueller appears to have little interest in violations by FBI or Department of Justice officials who likely violated the law out of their worry over, or hatred for, Mr. Trump.

We know that members of the FBI and DOJ misled the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court by deliberately hiding critical facts about the Steele dossier.

We know that John Brennan, James Clapper and James Comey all gave false or misleading testimony to Congress.

No doubt former Trump associate Paul Manafort deserves the scrutiny of the Mueller investigation. But he was in the same questionable business as his liberal counterpart, Tony Podesta (brother of Hillary Clinton campaign adviser John Podesta). Both wheeler-dealers have been mentioned in media reports of Russian collusion and have a long history of leveraging their political contacts for foreign cash. But only one so far has been indicted (and not for collusion).

Mr. Mueller has searched in vain for obstruction of justice. But we know Hillary Clinton aides Cheryl Mills and Huma Abedin deliberately misled FBI officials about Mrs. Clinton’s illicit email server, as did former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe.

If Mr. Mueller can’t find evidence of any Trump collusion with a foreign nation, perhaps he might find such collaboration right under his nose.

Hillary Clinton and her campaign team paid for research done by a British citizen, Christopher Steele, working for Fusion GPS, to smear Mr. Trump. Mr. Steele claims that he enlisted Russian sources to gather gossip on Mr. Trump in an attempt to sway the 2016 election. Members of the FBI, CIA and DOJ improperly helped to ensure that Mr. Steele’s unverified accusations and innuendos were conveyed to the media.

When there is no blind code of justice, people suspect that our institutions define wrong behavior and bad words as those in service to the wrong political agenda.

And they are right.

It 's very easy in hindsight to consider this an overreaction — now that we know crime began its decades-long decline in the early 1990s , and now that research has shown that mass incarceration only partly contributed to this decline .

justice,The Marshall Project,1,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/06/23/formerly-incarcerated-political-candidates,These Political Candidates Are Embracing Their Criminal Records,2020-06-23,Andi Buescher,"One of the first things Tarra Simmons tells voters when asking for their support isn ’ t the prestigious fellowships she ’ s won or the legislation she ’ s helped write . It ’ s about the years she spent behind bars .
It ’ s a story Simmons , a candidate for state representative in Kitsap County , Washington , has shared at countless campaign events , which these days are entirely online : How she lost her car , her house , her nursing license , her voting rights . How after coming home in 2013 , most of her minimum-wage paychecks from Burger King were taken to pay the $ 7,600 she owed in court fees . How she managed to climb out of that life , get a law degree and begin a civil rights nonprofit . And how all of it made her realize that only those who have lived through the system can fully understand how to fix it .
“ I went to prison . It ’ s not something I ’ m proud of , but I understand how people end up there , ” Simmons said at a May campaign fundraiser via Zoom , her digital background set to a generic corporate lobby . “ Our criminal justice system is just a Band-Aid ; I want to prevent [ incarceration ] from happening to begin with . ”
Simmons is one of a new crop of political candidates in 2020 for whom being formerly incarcerated isn ’ t a disqualifier or a political liability . It ’ s an identity—one they say is vital to represent in state capitals and the hallways of Congress , as lawmakers try to overhaul a system that spends billions to lock up mostly Black and brown people .
The ongoing protests against racism and police violence , sparked by the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis , have highlighted the distance between two Americas : one that has lived under the pressure , surveillance and control of the justice system , and one that has not . It ’ s unacceptable , candidates say , for only people who have never been on the other side of law enforcement to write the laws that affect those who have .
Simmons , who identifies as White and Hispanic , speaks often of the disproportionate impact the criminal justice system has on people of color . “ I am a mother of two Black sons and have been working on racial equity for nearly two decades , ” Simmons wrote in a recent campaign email , “ and I will be the first formerly incarcerated individual in our state legislature if we succeed in this election. ” She has called for demilitarizing the police and reinvesting police funding into community programs .
Kevin Harris is running for state representative in Detroit , Michigan , where he recently served as the departing representative ’ s legislative director . He came home from a 14-year sentence in 2006 and soon got involved in community organizing . He was 18 when he went to prison . “ It was the height of the crack epidemic . I had a little bit of a political awakening in understanding how the Department of Corrections treated people , ” he said . “ It ’ s not a coincidence that so many people from the Black community have criminal records . We ’ ve been targeted—we ’ ve always been targeted . ”
Now , Harris said , it ’ s even more important to talk about his experience in prison . As a Black formerly incarcerated organizer working on criminal justice , voters know he ’ s been “ in that fight ” long before George Floyd was killed . Now is his moment , he said . “ I ’ ve got to get to this place so my voice is elevated , so I have a bigger bullhorn , ” he said of the state Legislature . “ One-third of all Americans have some kind of criminal record . Almost every family has been touched by it . ”
There has been a dramatic shift in the criminal justice conversation in recent years . A majority of voters from both parties now say they would be more likely to vote for a candidate “ who supports criminal justice reform. ” And whether people leaving—or still in—prison can vote received unprecedented attention in the Democratic primary race . But voters rarely hear from candidates who have firsthand experience with the justice system .
Several formerly incarcerated candidates stressed that their platforms weren ’ t solely about prison reform , especially amid catastrophic public health and economic crises . “ I had to become more of an intersectional candidate , to respond to what my community needs , ” said Simmons , who at recent meetings talked about everything from how political districts are drawn to protecting habitats for salmon .
But she hopes her message of decarceration is more timely than ever . “ We ’ re going to have more momentum , especially if we can ground it in a health and economic argument … Incarceration costs us a lot of money . ”
Making it into the room where it happens will still not be easy . Fundraising for first-time candidates is a particular challenge with door-knocking on hold and in-person events cancelled because of the pandemic . And , like many other parts of civic life for those with felony convictions , serving in government is restricted by thousands of state-level laws . Multiple states—such as Illinois , Alabama , and Delaware—ban people with criminal convictions from holding most public offices . Others , like West Virginia , outlaw it after certain crimes , like bribery , or bar people for multiple years after their release . These laws disproportionately keep people of color , who are more likely to be sent to prison , out of public office .
If someone is legally able to run , the stigma of incarceration can still be a deterrent . Even Simmons—who was convicted of a lower-level drug offense in a liberal state—has faced significant blowback . In 2018 , a conservative political action committee used her story in a smear campaign against one of her supporters , Washington state senator Emily Randall . Randall had recently posted on Facebook , cheering Simmons ’ bid to become a licensed attorney . The mailers against her read : “ TOO SOFT ON CRIME … Randall has supported Tarra Simmons , a drug-addicted ex-con . ”
To Simmons ’ surprise , the ads sparked statewide backlash . The chair of the Washington state Republican Party called to apologize . It made Simmons think voters might be ready for a formerly incarcerated candidate . When state senator Sherry Appleton , the 16-year Democratic incumbent , encouraged Simmons to run for her seat , Simmons agreed . Kitsap County prosecutor Chad Enright , who leads the same office that sent Simmons to prison , has also endorsed her .
But in news coverage of her candidacy , Simmons has had to deal with headlines calling her “ ex-inmate ” or stories that list her criminal conviction as one of the only details .
“ There ’ s a missing voice in our Legislature , ” Simmons said . “ You have a lot of well-intentioned advocates who are trying to push criminal justice reform , but they can ’ t know it as intimately as people who have survived it . ”
“ Survived ” is the right word to describe Simmons ’ early life . As is true for most women who end up in prison , she was the victim of serious crime long before she was the perpetrator . Growing up in Bremerton , across the Puget Sound from Seattle , Simmons said most members of her immediate family dealt with addiction . Most had served time . No one graduated high school . Simmons ran away from home and by 14 , had lived through foster care , juvenile detention , homelessness , sexual assault and trafficking . At 15 she had her first child .
His birth marked a new chapter for Simmons , connecting her with social services and prompting her to enroll in an alternative high school . As a single mother , she worked her way through high school , college and nursing school , eventually getting a steady job as an E.R . nurse . She had a second child .
But a series of events resurfaced Simmons ’ childhood trauma . A spinal injury led to a painkiller prescription , which led to an opioid addiction . Her addictions spiraled into drug dealing , and soon she was facing criminal charges for theft , drugs and gun possession . In 2011 , a judge sentenced her to 20 months in prison .
Simmons began substance abuse treatment while incarcerated . When volunteer law students helped her file a motion to maintain custody of her kids , she started thinking about applying to law school herself . Simmons wanted to fight the avalanche of civil legal consequences that came with her criminal conviction : a house in foreclosure , the loss of her nursing license , her car repossessed .
“ People only associate me with my incarceration history , not the tremendous amount of violence I ’ ve survived , ” Simmons said . “ I had a really hard time trusting people . Meeting these volunteers made me believe I could heal . ”
After her release in 2013 , Simmons enrolled at Seattle University School of Law . She graduated with honors and won a prestigious Skadden Fellowship for recent grads working in public interest law . Governor Jay Inslee appointed her to lead a new statewide reentry council . But her own criminal history would yet again get in the way .
The “ character and fitness board ” of the Washington State Bar Association wouldn ’ t let her take the exam required to be a licensed lawyer , claiming that she minimized her drug abuse in her application . “ [ S ] ome of the attitudes she expressed in the record and at the hearing signal that her acquired fame has nurtured not integrity and honesty , but a sense of entitlement to privileges and recognition beyond the reach of others , ” board members wrote .
Simmons enlisted her friend and mentor Shon Hopwood—another formerly incarcerated attorney and Georgetown Law professor—and appealed the decision to the state ’ s highest court .
“ They let someone with five armed bank robberies into the bar , ” Hopwood said , referring to himself . “ Losing my shit is the nicest way to describe how I felt . There are few people on this planet who have overcome the things that she has . ”
The Washington State Supreme Court handed back a unanimous decision the same day they heard arguments . She won .
Simmons is now the founder and executive director of Civil Survival Project , a nonprofit focused on reducing barriers for people coming home from prison and involving them in policy-making . The group has been pushing for legislation to automatically restore voting rights for people leaving prison and to expunge certain criminal records .
The Next To Die A detailed , up-to-date schedule of upcoming executions in the United States
Many supporters who attend Simmons ’ campaign events carry the invisible burden of a criminal record , and know intimately the innumerable , byzantine obstacles it creates .
“ I couldn ’ t get life insurance because I have a felony , ” said Woodean Nickerson , a social work student , over appetizers at Simmons ’ campaign launch in January .
“ I couldn ’ t get a job , ” said Andre Henderson , a college student who , despite great grades , was initially denied a work-study position . When the community college told him they had to run a background check , “ It was like I was being policed and patted down all over again . It ’ s traumatizing , ” he said .
A felony curtails involvement in civic life , too . Keeda Haynes , a former public defender who served nearly four years in federal prison in 2006 , is currently running for Congress in Nashville , Tennessee . But she could not run for local office or even sit on a jury until she petitioned a court to restore her civil rights—a legal process that can be difficult to navigate . “ This is an opportunity to change the narrative and have tough hard conversations around barriers to reentry , ” she said of her campaign . In a recent mailer comparing her record on racial justice to her opponent ’ s , Haynes noted her “ personal experience with the racist criminal justice system . ”
Candidates say that experience is invaluable in shaping policy . “ There ’ s a huge difference between wisdom and education . Education is what you learn from books . Wisdom is what you learn from your own life , ” said Angela Stanton-King , who is running as a Republican for Congress in Georgia ’ s 5th District , against longtime civil rights leader and representative John Lewis . She has been a vocal supporter of Donald Trump and law enforcement during the ongoing protests for racial justice .
Stanton-King served over two years in federal prison . She says being shackled while giving birth prompted her to push for a federal ban on the practice . Unlike many Republicans , she supports the right to vote for anyone with a felony conviction once they leave prison . “ I ’ m here to dispel the saying , ‘ once a felon always a felon. ’ That ’ s not true , ” she said .
The countdown is on to August ’ s Democratic primary for state races in Washington . As the pandemic continues , Simmons has increased online events and phone banking—which her campaign has also been using to connect vulnerable constituents with resources during the shutdown .
So far , Simmons has raised over $ 165,000 , a little over $ 20,000 of which came from a January fundraiser in New York City , hosted by several national criminal justice advocates , records show . ( The organizers included a member of ███ 's board of directors . ) Her main opponent in the primary is Leslie Daugs , a current Bremerton City Council member , who has raised a little more than $ 20,000 .
Election day will be the true litmus test for voters . “ The same way we ask the question is the ‘ U.S . ready for a female president ? ’ —are we ready for a U.S. representative that has a felony on their record ? ” asked Haynes , the Tennessee candidate challenging incumbent Jim Cooper in that state ’ s 5th congressional district . “ I would like to think the answer is yes , but we will see . I don ’ t think that ’ s going to be the deciding factor . ”
In her campaign for Congress in Maryland , Mckayla Wilkes spoke openly about her experience in juvenile detention and a brief stint in jail while pregnant , for driving with a suspended license . She lost in the primary on June 2 , against long-time incumbent Rep. Steny Hoyer . “ I never thought that someone formerly incarcerated like myself would even be taken seriously , ” she tweeted . “ We lost . But it does appear we won more votes than any primary challenger to Hoyer in 40 years . ”
Regardless of election results , just seeing people speak openly about their criminal record is a turning point for some . Kelly Olson , an Olympia , Washington , organizer with the Civil Survival Project , attended one of Simmons ’ early campaign events in December . For the first several years after she came home from prison in 2007 , Olson didn ’ t share her past unless absolutely necessary—including during an internship at the Washington state senate . It was only after she met Simmons that she “ came out ” as formerly incarcerated .
“ I was holding my own life back , it was my own internal shame . It ’ s so important for people to see us as humans , to see we ’ re capable of leadership , ” Olson said . “ Seeing Tarra do it [ makes me ] realize our stories do matter . I wish I had come out sooner . ”","One of the first things Tarra Simmons tells voters when asking for their support isn’t the prestigious fellowships she’s won or the legislation she’s helped write. It’s about the years she spent behind bars.

It’s a story Simmons, a candidate for state representative in Kitsap County, Washington, has shared at countless campaign events, which these days are entirely online: How she lost her car, her house, her nursing license, her voting rights. How after coming home in 2013, most of her minimum-wage paychecks from Burger King were taken to pay the $7,600 she owed in court fees. How she managed to climb out of that life, get a law degree and begin a civil rights nonprofit. And how all of it made her realize that only those who have lived through the system can fully understand how to fix it.

“I went to prison. It’s not something I’m proud of, but I understand how people end up there,” Simmons said at a May campaign fundraiser via Zoom, her digital background set to a generic corporate lobby. “Our criminal justice system is just a Band-Aid; I want to prevent [incarceration] from happening to begin with.”

Simmons is one of a new crop of political candidates in 2020 for whom being formerly incarcerated isn’t a disqualifier or a political liability. It’s an identity—one they say is vital to represent in state capitals and the hallways of Congress, as lawmakers try to overhaul a system that spends billions to lock up mostly Black and brown people.

The ongoing protests against racism and police violence, sparked by the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, have highlighted the distance between two Americas: one that has lived under the pressure, surveillance and control of the justice system, and one that has not. It’s unacceptable, candidates say, for only people who have never been on the other side of law enforcement to write the laws that affect those who have.

Simmons, who identifies as White and Hispanic, speaks often of the disproportionate impact the criminal justice system has on people of color. “I am a mother of two Black sons and have been working on racial equity for nearly two decades,” Simmons wrote in a recent campaign email, “and I will be the first formerly incarcerated individual in our state legislature if we succeed in this election.” She has called for demilitarizing the police and reinvesting police funding into community programs.

Kevin Harris is running for state representative in Detroit, Michigan, where he recently served as the departing representative’s legislative director. He came home from a 14-year sentence in 2006 and soon got involved in community organizing. He was 18 when he went to prison. “It was the height of the crack epidemic. I had a little bit of a political awakening in understanding how the Department of Corrections treated people,” he said. “It’s not a coincidence that so many people from the Black community have criminal records. We’ve been targeted—we’ve always been targeted.”

Now, Harris said, it’s even more important to talk about his experience in prison. As a Black formerly incarcerated organizer working on criminal justice, voters know he’s been “in that fight” long before George Floyd was killed. Now is his moment, he said. “I’ve got to get to this place so my voice is elevated, so I have a bigger bullhorn,” he said of the state Legislature. “One-third of all Americans have some kind of criminal record. Almost every family has been touched by it.”

There has been a dramatic shift in the criminal justice conversation in recent years. A majority of voters from both parties now say they would be more likely to vote for a candidate “who supports criminal justice reform.” And whether people leaving—or still in—prison can vote received unprecedented attention in the Democratic primary race. But voters rarely hear from candidates who have firsthand experience with the justice system.

Several formerly incarcerated candidates stressed that their platforms weren’t solely about prison reform, especially amid catastrophic public health and economic crises. “I had to become more of an intersectional candidate, to respond to what my community needs,” said Simmons, who at recent meetings talked about everything from how political districts are drawn to protecting habitats for salmon.

But she hopes her message of decarceration is more timely than ever. “We’re going to have more momentum, especially if we can ground it in a health and economic argument … Incarceration costs us a lot of money.”

Making it into the room where it happens will still not be easy. Fundraising for first-time candidates is a particular challenge with door-knocking on hold and in-person events cancelled because of the pandemic. And, like many other parts of civic life for those with felony convictions, serving in government is restricted by thousands of state-level laws. Multiple states—such as Illinois, Alabama, and Delaware—ban people with criminal convictions from holding most public offices. Others, like West Virginia, outlaw it after certain crimes, like bribery, or bar people for multiple years after their release. These laws disproportionately keep people of color, who are more likely to be sent to prison, out of public office.

If someone is legally able to run, the stigma of incarceration can still be a deterrent. Even Simmons—who was convicted of a lower-level drug offense in a liberal state—has faced significant blowback. In 2018, a conservative political action committee used her story in a smear campaign against one of her supporters, Washington state senator Emily Randall. Randall had recently posted on Facebook, cheering Simmons’ bid to become a licensed attorney. The mailers against her read: “TOO SOFT ON CRIME … Randall has supported Tarra Simmons, a drug-addicted ex-con.”

To Simmons’ surprise, the ads sparked statewide backlash. The chair of the Washington state Republican Party called to apologize. It made Simmons think voters might be ready for a formerly incarcerated candidate. When state senator Sherry Appleton, the 16-year Democratic incumbent, encouraged Simmons to run for her seat, Simmons agreed. Kitsap County prosecutor Chad Enright, who leads the same office that sent Simmons to prison, has also endorsed her.

But in news coverage of her candidacy, Simmons has had to deal with headlines calling her “ex-inmate” or stories that list her criminal conviction as one of the only details.

“There’s a missing voice in our Legislature,” Simmons said. “You have a lot of well-intentioned advocates who are trying to push criminal justice reform, but they can’t know it as intimately as people who have survived it.”

But a series of events resurfaced Simmons’ childhood trauma. A spinal injury led to a painkiller prescription, which led to an opioid addiction. Her addictions spiraled into drug dealing, and soon she was facing criminal charges for theft, drugs and gun possession. In 2011, a judge sentenced her to 20 months in prison.

Simmons began substance abuse treatment while incarcerated. When volunteer law students helped her file a motion to maintain custody of her kids, she started thinking about applying to law school herself.

The informant’s attorney, Victoria Toensing, said former attorney generals under the Obama administration, Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch, are the reason her client hasn’t been able to “tell what all the Russians were talking about during the time that all these bribery payments were made,” on Fox Business Monday.

Some of the information was redacted.

Senators wondered what was redacted.

They also said the State Department notes suggest Mr. Steele had communicated with the press. That, they said, would contradict what the FBI had said when it used his unverified information to help win a secret surveillance warrant against one-time Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

It ’ s not just a matter of convenience , the court watchers said . Public trust in what happens in court is eroded when they—or anyone else—can ’ t witness it , they said , and their presence helps ensure the courts function as they are supposed to .
“ What we 've seen over the past few years is that our presence really does matter , ” said Zoë Adel , a lead organizer with the New York City court watch . “ It changes people 's behavior—judges set lower bail—when they know court watchers are watching and they 're being held accountable . ”
To be sure , most judges and court administrators have had little choice but to close courthouses under state orders or health guidelines aimed at slowing the virus . To be able to conduct hearings that can ’ t be postponed , they are joining many other Americans in adapting quickly to online platforms many had never used before , leading to technical problems . As NPR reported , other public meetings that used open online conferencing have at times been targets of harassment .
“ This was the first time we 've done Zoom proceedings , and we rolled it out fast , ” said District Court Judge Keva Landrum in New Orleans , referring to a popular video conference platform . She said judges wanted to make sure it would work before finding out how to allow public access . “ Now that it has been going well and judges are more settled with it , I think judges will be increasingly willing to provide access to interested parties , ” she said .
Shortly after speaking with Landrum , ███ was granted access to observe a magistrate court session on Zoom , and faced no difficulties following along . On Saturday , Landrum provided access to Court Watch NOLA moving forward .

But the hastily written law left out language guaranteeing public access to those video proceedings .
On state and local courts , access has been spotty as each court comes up with its own rules on the fly , court watchers said .
The shift is happening so rapidly that legal observers are still largely playing catch up . Douglas Keith , counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice , a progressive advocacy organization , said the group was still piecing together the constitutional questions that video court proceedings might raise .
“ How will remote hearings affect the quality of representation in criminal cases , and the ability of defendants to speak to their lawyers with the frequency and privacy they need ? How will appearing on video affect the jury ’ s and judge ’ s view of a defendant ? ” he said , to name a few .
Keith noted that in the 1984 case Waller v. Georgia , the U.S. Supreme Court declared public trials to be “ essential ” for the people accused because “ the presence of interested spectators may keep his triers keenly alive to a sense of their responsibility and to the importance of their functions . ”
Public access to the courts is particularly important during disasters , said Simone Levine , executive director of Court Watch NOLA in New Orleans .

Julie Mente , a New York court watcher who has been volunteering since the program launched in 2018 , said she worries about not being in court . “ The courtrooms are n't a safe place to be in a pandemic , but neither are the holding cells , ” Mente said . “ So I understand why we 're not there and why it 's being done differently , but I definitely worry about the public not having easy access to those proceedings . ”

Court watchers in Los Angeles , where local courts have not made public access to online conferences possible , said they ’ ve shifted to data analysis to try to force accountability . For example , they monitor listings of cases in the court ’ s online system to track prosecution of petty misdemeanors . The group argues that such arrests are a threat to public health during a pandemic . Kath Rogers , a lead organizer of Court Watch Los Angeles , said as recently as March 28 they found prosecutions on the court calendar for the minor offenses of “ personal property on sidewalk ” and “ blocking sidewalk . ”
“ It doesn ’ t give us a complete picture , ” Rogers said of the listings . “ But it ’ s the best we have at the moment , because the courts have not implemented the technology necessary to ensure public access to the courts . ”
In Miami , a new court watch program , barely two weeks into launch , was put on pause by the pandemic , said Ayodele Gomih , its lead organizer . Gomih said that while she and fellow court watchers would look for ways to observe hearings online , their most immediate concern was “ getting folks out ” of jail and prison .
“ There 's no way that this is n't going to cause downstream disaster , ” Gomih , an epidemiologist by training , said in reference to the close quarters and lack of protective measures in jails . “ You have to act now , so that ’ s got to be the priority . ”

In the civic revival after the storm , volunteers formed Court Watch NOLA to keep an eye on local courts . The group has catalogued everything from excessive delays and use of continuances , to how some judges were using the results of unconfirmed drug tests to put people behind bars .
Levine said that as the nation deals with a pandemic , which some have compared to Katrina , how judges and court administrators respond may lead to similar civic engagement and more court watch programs elsewhere .

Defense lawyer Marc Mukasey said Gallagher cried 'tears of joy , emotion , freedom and absolute euphoria ' . Family and friends clutched each other in relief in the courtroom .
Mukasey added outside court : 'Suffice it to say this is a huge victory .
The maximum sentence for posing with a corpse is four months and he spent longer than that in confinement awaiting trial before being freed by President Trump in March therefore he left the court Tuesday .
'We have a sentencing to do , but the maximum sentence of what they 're about to sentence him on is much less than the time that they 've already had him in the brig , ' defense attorney Tim Parlatore said after Tuesday 's verdict . 'So he is going home . '
Parlatore said the trial was a 'mutiny ' and that he was being set up for the murder of the young ISIS fighter in 2017 by a group of younger SEALs who did not like his tough , old-school leadership style .
'The jury found him not guilty of murder , stabbing , the shootings , not guilty of all those things . They did find him guilty of taking a photo with a dead terrorist which we admitted all along , he 's in that photo , ' Parlatore added .
At the time they started complaining about him to their superiors , the other SEALs had been back in the US for six months and Gallagher was up for a promotion and a Silver Star .

Prosecutors told them that Gallagher 's guilt was clear in photos he took with the dead militant 's body but he was acquitted of other charges
Gallagher claimed he is not responsible for the boy 's death and is being set up by younger , less disciplined SEALs who had it out for him because he had been tough on them on the battlefield . He celebrates his freedom outside court

The turning point in the court martial was when one of the SEALs , Corey Scott , who had been expected to testify for the prosecution took responsibility for killing the boy Gallagher was alleged to have murdered .
Scott now faces perjury charges from the Naval prosecutors he blindsided . They say he made it up to protect Gallagher after being granted immunity for his own war crimes .
Earlier Tuesday Andrea shared a black and white photograph on a Facebook page where she has been keeping fans and followers updated throughout the trial , Andrea Gallagher wrote : 'Please pray for a Not Guilty verdict and the # TRUTH to finally set us Free as the jury deliberates again today so this nightmare can end . '
Prosecutors told them that Gallagher 's guilt was clear in photos he took with the dead militant 's body .
They also pointed to texts where Gallagher allegedly told friends : 'Got him with my hunting knife ' and 'there 's a good story behind this ' , claiming those proved his guilt .
They tried to throw out the confession of another SEAL who took credit for killing the boy , claiming he was lying because he had been given immunity and wanted to protect Gallagher , and said jurors must focus instead on what Gallagher said after the boy 's death .
Gallagher 's wife also uploaded an Instagram video on Tuesday after the verdict and said 'we have our life back '
The government 's evidence in this case is Chief Gallagher 's words , Chief Gallagher 's pictures , Chief Gallagher 's SEALs Navy Comdr . Jeff Pietrzyk
They claim he went off the rails after 19 years in the armed forces and stabbed the boy unexpectedly in front of other SEALs while clearing villages in May 2017 .
Gallagher claimed he is not responsible for the boy 's death and is being set up by younger , less disciplined SEALs who had it out for him because he had been tough on them on the battlefield .
The defense told jurors that those SEALs were lying when they claimed to have seen him stab the boy angrily .
He was only reported to his supervisors after the other SEALs learned he was up for a promotion and a Silver Star , the third highest honor in the military .
They said there was no evidence , aside from their testimony , that Gallagher committed pre-meditated murder and that he is being set up .
The prosecution needed two-thirds of the jury , or in this case five jurors , to agree to a guilty verdict to convict .
'Navy Cmdr . Jeff Pietrzyk said in closing arguments that text messages by Gallagher show he is guilty .
One message said : ' I 've got a cool story for you when I get back . I 've got my knife skills on . '

Edward Gallagher 's lawyer Marc Mukasey emerges from court victorious on Tuesday
Mukasey , one of Trump 's former lawyers , could not contain his 'euphoria ' as he emerged
Another text stated : 'Good story behind this . Got him with my hunting knife . '
He then showed a photo of the dead prisoner with Gallagher holding up his head by the hair .
'The government 's evidence in this case is Chief Gallagher 's words , Chief Gallagher 's pictures , Chief Gallagher 's SEALs , ' Pietrzyk said .
The prosecutor said the witness who changed his story and claimed to have killed the prisoner himself was lying to protect Gallagher .
'He [ Corey Scott ] changed his account to assist Chief Gallagher . He had his ' I am Spartacus ' moment because he thought it would assist Chief Gallagher , ' he said .
Pietrzyk acknowledged that the victim is not sympathetic but said the difference between ISIS and the US Army was that Americans did not kill once a fighter was taken out of battle .
'Before the air strike , he would have done anything in his power to kill an American , ' Pietrzyk said , but he said the care of war prisoners is what sets U.S. forces apart .
'We 're not ISIS . When we capture someone and they 're out of the fight , that 's it .

TIMELINE FEBRUARY 2017 : Edward Gallagher deploys to Mosul , Iraq , with Alpha platoon SEAL Team 7 MAY 3 2017 : Death of ISIS prisoner in Mosul . The 17-year-old had been captured by Iraqi forces and the SEALs were called in to give him medical care because he had a collapsed lung JUNE 18 2017 : Gallagher allegedly shoots at unarmed elderly man JULY 2017 : Gallagher allegedly shoots a girl SEPTEMBER 2017 : SEAL Team 7 returns home MARCH 2018 : Seven members of the team call a meeting with troop commander to discuss Gallagher 's alleged behavior during deployment Gallagher is given the Bronze Star days later APRIL 2018 : Investigation is formally launched SEPTEMBER 2018 : Gallagher is charged MARCH 2019 : Trump intervenes to remove Gallagher from base confinement and lets him await trial at home MAY 2019 : The New York Times reports that Trump is considering pardons for Gallagher and anyone else convicted of war crimes in the trial JUNE 4 2019 : Judge removes Cmdr . Christopher Czaplak , the prosecutor , after he admitted to trying to track defense emails JUNE 17 2019 : Trial starts in San Diego JUNE 20 2019 : Corey Scott says he killed ISIS fighter by covering his breathing tube in an act of mercy to stop him from being tortured by Iraqi forces
During the trial , it was revealed that nearly all the platoon members readily posed for photos with the dead prisoner and watched as Gallagher read his reenlistment oath near the body in an impromptu ceremony .
Defense lawyer Tim Parlatore began his closing argument the same way he started the trial .
'This is case is not about murder , it 's about mutiny , ' Parlatore said .
He added there were 'gaping holes ' in the testimony and said Gallagher was the target of a 'fixation ' of military prosecutors .
'They started with a conclusion ... [ and ] ... ignored everything that did n't fit , ' he said .
The attorney said there 's no body , no forensics , and the SEALs who testified against Gallagher lied because they did n't like his demanding leadership . He called the pictures of Gallagher clutching the corpse 's hair and his texts about his knife skills just the dark humor of a warrior .
Parlatore also contended that investigators never asked Scott about the cause of the death , which is why they were surprised by his testimony .
The defense showed video clips by an Iraq TV crew of the prisoner being interviewed after he was hit , then arriving at the SEAL compound and being handed over to the SEALs by the Iraqi troops .
It also showed Gallagher pulling out his medical bag and treating the detainee .
Gallagher 's attorneys said there are a number of things that could have caused the militant 's death , including internal injuries from the blast .
Over the last two weeks , seven SEALs have testified against him in the Navy Base in San Diego .
They painted him as a blood thirsty leader who acted like God on the battlefield and thought himself above the law .
But one , who had been expected to testify in favor of the prosecution , stunned the courtroom by taking responsibility for the most serious charge - the murder of the young ISIS prisoner .
It blindsided prosecutors who have now threatened the SEAL with perjury charges . He had been granted immunity for any war crimes in exchange for his testimony .
In their closing arguments on Monday , prosecutors said Gallagher 's guilt was undeniable .
THE WAR CRIMES GALLAGHER WAS ACCUSED OF Murder ( not guilty ) On May 3 , SEAL Team 7 was clearing villages near Mosul when they learned that Iraqi forces , which they were helping to fight ISIS , had encountered a young , IS fighter . He was injured and in need of medical care after suffering a collapsed lung in a strike . The boy had been brought into the SEAL compound by a Humvee of Iraqi fighters , the SEALs testified . Gallagher was not at the compound but was out on the field . When he call came over the radio that the boy needed care , Gallagher volunteered . According to witness testimony , he told the Iraqi soldiers not to waste their own medics on caring for the enemy and that he instead would tend to him . 'Lay off him , he 's mine , ' he is accused of saying . When they got back to the base , some of the SEALs said they saw Gallagher give him medical aid . They then claimed , however , that he took his hunting knife and spontaneously stabbed him twice in the neck and once in the side . One testified that it caused him to bleed so profusely there was blood spurting from his neck . 'It looked similar to a baby throwing up , ' said Special Operations Chief Craig Miller . Others say that the last time they saw the militant , he was alive and in Gallagher 's care but he was dead when they returned . The testimony which varies greatest is Corey Scott 's who said he was the one who killed the boy because he wanted to spare him the torture he faced from Iraqi soldiers . Attempted murder ( not guilty ) There are two charges of assault on 'noncombatants ' listed in the charge sheet . One is against an elderly man who the SEALs say they saw Gallagher shoot from his sniper 's nest for no reason . The other is a young , schoolage girl who they say he shot . The SEALs said he claimed to have killed them but it is not clear from the charging sheet if they actually died . According to testimony , he allegedly told them over the radio : 'You guys missed them but I got them . ' On another occasion , the SEALs say he shot a different girl , aged between 12 and 14 , in the stomach . She was wearing a floral hijab , they said . The defense argued that none of the witnesses actually saw him pull the trigger and that was entirely possible the civilians had been shot by ISIS and not Gallagher . Posing with a corpse , reenlistment ceremony next to a corpse and flying a drone over it ( guilty of posing with corpse ) Photographs that were shown to the jury showed Gallagher and the other SEALs posing with the corpse of the dead Iraqi fighter once he was dead . He sent the image to friends and boasted about it , according to the SEALs . Not long after he died , Portier reenlisted Gallagher into the Navy next to the boy 's corpse which had been covered by a blanket . There was also a charge for flying a drone over it in a disrespectful way once he was dead . The other SEALs participated in all of these three charges which come under the term 'Novel ' . The crime is that Gallagher discredited the Navy in his actions . All of the others , with the exception of Portier , were given immunity in exchange for testifying against him . Obstructing justice x 3 ( not guilty ) Prosecutors allege that Gallagher obstructed justice by trying to stop other SEALs from testifying against him once the investigation was underway and before it began . They say that he threatened them and told them he would kill them if they ever told superiors how he had behaved during the deployment . Unlawfully firing his gun ( not guilty ) Gallagher allegedly fired his rifle indiscriminately , at least '10 times ' than some of the other SEALs said they did , while deployed . Unlawful possession of a controlled substance ( dropped before trial ) He is accused of having Sustaon 250 , a testosterone injection . Prosecutors claimed he was using the steroid improperly . He argued that it was part of a medical kit he had been given to give to others that was discovered during a search of his house . Wrongful use of a controlled substance ( dropped before trial ) Gallagher also had tramadol , a highly addictive painkiller , which they say he was abusing . He argued that he had long held a prescription for it .
THE PROSECUTION - War crimes including murder , attempted murder , obstruction of justice , conduct unbecoming of an officer - Gallagher was an unhinged 19-year veteran on his 8th tour who thought he was above the law - SEALs testified that he shot indiscriminately at Iraqi civilians including an old man collecting water and a girl - They say he boasted about killing 'hundreds ' during his tours and was blood thirsty - When he was indicted , some of the SEALs said they spent more time protecting Iraqi civilians from Gallagher than they did fighting ISIS - They claim Gallagher plunged his knife into ISIS fighter 's neck twice and his side once in a sudden attack - Afterwards , he justified it by calling him 'just another ISIS dirtbag ' - The SEALs say they had to speak up against him for others ' safety
THE DEFENSE - Gallagher is an honorable , life-saving SEAL who has spent nearly 20 years in the military protecting people all over the world - He is a medic and a sniper whose mission is to protect and serve , no matter the mission - In 2017 , he was leading a group of less disciplined SEALs during his 8th deployment and they were in Mosul , Iraq - Some were angry that he had been recommended for the Silver Star , the third highest honor in the Navy - He was tough on them , calling them cowards in the battlefield and accusing them of not pulling their weight , and they did not like it - On the day the ISIS prisoner died , Gallagher had given the young boy medical treatment - He made an incision in his throat to give him a breathing tube - However the boy lost his life after that was out of his control
The Alpha platoon SEAL Team 7 which was splintered by the trial
When the SEALs returned from Mosul and set up their WhatsApp group , SO1 Dalton Tolbert , who was a sniper during their tour , tried to drum up support from others to report Gallagher .
' I saw Eddie Gallagher shoot at someone who did n't deserve to die . I shot more warning shots to protect civilians [ from Eddie ] than I ever shot at ISIS , ' he said in one message in their WhatsApp group , The Sewing Circle .
He gave one example where he said he saw Gallagher shoot an unarmed elderly Iraqi man in a tunic who had been collecting water from a river .
He claimed he fired a warning shot to try to scare the man away but that Gallagher fired at him and wounded him .
Tolbert had been accepted into the famous SEAL Team 6 , which was responsible for taking out Osama Bin Laden .
He said that as a result of his testimony at Gallagher 's trial , his dream of carrying out covert operations for that team is now over .
SO1 Dylan Dille is illustrated above in a shirt and tie , sitting in front of Gallagher , with a photograph in the background of the men crowded around the ISIS fighter once dead
Dille 's testimony was some of the most damaging . He claimed that Gallagher told him that he would like to kill an ISIS prisoner if the opportunity arose .
His remarks were what informed the prosecution 's arguments that it was a premeditated killing .
Dille claimed that on the day the boy died , he was with Gallagher when the call came over the radio that a prisoner was at the base .
'No one touch him . He 's all mine , ' he claimed he said .
He said Gallagher had told him earlier : 'If we ever get a wounded enemy , that the medics know what to do to nurse him to death . '
He did not claim to have seen Gallagher kill him . Instead , he said the boy was alive when he left him
He returned to his post and then came back to the group later but found the prisoner dead , he said .
Later that day , he said Gallagher held a meeting with the junior SEALs because they were so uncomfortable with what had happened .
He said that at that meeting , Gallagher told them : 'This was just an ISIS dirtbag . Next time we get a prisoner … it will be out of sight , out of mind . '
Dille served in the Navy from 2010 until last year .
Miller 's testimony was among the most dramatic . He said that he saw Gallagher plunge the knife into the boy 's neck and that blood spurted out .
' I saw him stab the prisoner in the side of the neck . He kind of like jumped back a little bit , ' after the alleged stabbing .
'The blood just came out . It looked similar to a baby throwing up , ' he said .
Miller was who led The Sewing Circle , according to Parlatore , Gallagher 's lawyer .
He was the first to report him to superiors once they had returned from Iraq . It was around the time that Gallagher was up for promotion to Master Chief and he was being considered for the Silver Star , the third highest honor in the armed forces .
Miller first went to Lt . Commander Robert Breisch in around March 2018 , when Gallagher was up for the award . He told Breisch that it was based on lies and that he did n't deserve it . When asked why , he first claimed Gallagher stole food from care packages in the platoon .
When he was told that was n't enough to open an investigation , he claimed Gallagher used dangerous war tactics like using other SEALs as bait .
Again , he was told it was not enough . Over the next five months , Breisch said one of the SEALs went to him every week to complain about Gallagher .
Eventually , in around August 2018 , Miller finally claimed he 'd stabbed an ISIS prisoner .
' [ He ] blurted and vomited it out . He said , 'Eddie stabbed a prisoner , '' Breisch testified .
Scott had been expected to testify in line with the other SEALs and accuse Gallagher of murdering the boy .
But when he got on the witness stand , he blindsided prosecutors and the courtroom by claiming he was the one who killed the ISIS prisoner by closing off his air supply by covering his breathing tube with his thumb .
He said it was an act of mercy because he knew Iraqi forces would torture the young man if he let him live and handed him over .
Corey Scott ( in a court sketch ) was called as a prosecution witness on Thursday in the case against Gallagher but stunned the prosecutors by taking responsibility for the murder . Now , he is being threatened with perjury charges
Scott and Gallagher were the two medics on the scene and they were closest to the boy when he died .
He said he did see Gallagher stab him but that it was not what ultimately killed him .
Prosecutors have accused him of lying to protect Gallagher and say he only did it because he had been granted immunity himself .
He insisted he was being honest and merely did not want Gallagher , who has a wife and children , to spend the rest of his life in prison .
Scott has since been threatened by Navy prosecutors with perjury charges .
Vriens testified that he had seen Gallagher shoot a young girl in a hijab and sent others scattering .
He claimed to have watched through his scope as the girl was hit in the stomach and then dragged by one of her friends to safety .
But upon cross-examination , Vriens admitted he only saw it through his own sniper scope and did not see Gallagher pull the trigger .
He also conceded that ISIS had been shooting civilians that day , leaving open the possibility that it could have been one of their snipers who injured the girl .
Byrne testified that he was wearing a helmet fitted with a camera when the ISIS prisoner was brought into the base .
Footage taken from it was shown to the jury . He said that he saw the prisoner alive but that he left him in Gallagher 's care and returned to find him dead .
SO1 Terrance 'TC ' Byrne is shown pointing to a photo of the dead fighter on the ground
MacNeil , who had roomed with Gallagher in the past , was the first to take the stand .
He claimed that after they returned from Mosul and there were rumors of an investigation , Gallagher and Portier approached him in a parking lot where he said Gallagher ran up to him and threatened him .
'Chief Gallagher got in my face and said 'If you take me down , I 'll take all of you down . I 've got s * * t on all of you , ' he told the trial .
Portier was the supervisor during the deployment and he has been charged separately for covering up Gallagher 's alleged crimes .
He conducted the reenlistment ceremony next to the dead ISIS fighter 's body once he had stopped breathing and was also filmed walking past the SEALs as they played with a drone near the youngster 's body .
He allegedly ordered the SEALs to delete the incriminating photographs and videos taking during deployment which could put Gallagher behind bars .
Portier 's own defense team has claimed , like Gallagher 's , that they are being unfairly prosecuted .
At his trial , it was revealed that a repository where alleged war crimes are meant to be logged and then investigated has sat empty since it was created in 2009 .
SEALs referred to Gallagher as 'el diablo ' and plotted how to bring him down before war crimes trial in secretive WhatsApp group they called 'The Sewing Circle
The Navy SEALs who testified against Gallagher discussed reporting him to their superiors in a secret WhatsApp group called The Sewing Circle for months before he was indicted .
Seven members of the Alpha platoon Seal Team 7 testified against Gallagher at his two-week long trial in San Diego .
They had already spoken at length about why they thought he should no longer be allowed to serve in the military on the group , created after they returned from Mosul in 2017 .
One SEAL claimed in their group text that he spent more time protecting civilians 'from Eddie ' than he did fighting ISIS
When they returned home , Gallagher was celebrated for his bravery and the Navy was poised to award him the Silver Star , the third highest honor in the military .
The SEALs say it was because they could not allow him , in good conscience , to be celebrated when he had behaved in the ways they described .
Gallagher 's attorney has suggested they were jealous that he was being recognized and they were not .
Among the messages was one where Corey Scott , the medic who took responsibility for the death of an ISIS prisoner Gallagher was charged with murdering , said he was 'ready to fight and kill . '
Others claimed in the messages to have spent more time trying to save Iraqi civilians from Gallagher than they did fighting ISIS .
How Trump weighed in on trial to get Gallagher better terms and may pardon him if he is convicted and the Navy SEAL 's army of Republican support
The case not only made waves in the armed forces , it also caught the attention of prominent politicians and even the president .
Before he went on trial , Trump who intervened to free Gallagher from the brig , the Navy equivalent of prison , and give him better bail terms while he awaited his day in court .
'In honor of his past service to our Country , Navy Seal # EddieGallagher will soon be moved to less restrictive confinement while he awaits his day in court , ' the president
Two months later , it was reported that he would consider pardoning Gallagher should he be convicted .
His interference was the culmination of requests from Republicans to let Gallagher spend precious time with his family , at home , before potentially being jailed for life .
In March , Trump , responding to requests from Republican lawmakers and Gallagher 's wife , moved him out of the brig and into less restrictive confinements
Gallagher 's team of lawyers includes Marc Mukasey ( left ) , who worked for Trump , and Navy veteran Tim Parlatore ( right )
Rudy Giuliani has also weighed in on the case on Twitter , alleging misconduct against prosecutors
'We ask that you weigh this decision given the terrible message Chief Gallagher 's confinement sends to our warfighters , that they can be confined behind bars away from their family , legal defense , and community for nine months before their day in court , ' the lawmakers asked Navy Region Southwest commander Rear Adm. Yancy B. Lindsey .
Also on his team was Bernard Kerik , the former NYPD commissioner
One was Dan Crenshaw , the Republican representative for Texas who lost an eye fighting in Afghanistan and was a SEAL himself before taking up politics .
The other was Duncan Hunter , a Marine veteran from California .
In their request , they added : 'To confine any service member for that duration of time , regardless of the authority to do so , sends a chilling message to those who fight for our freedoms . '
Their support of Gallagher and concerns about the case are echoed on forums , petitions and support groups where his fans called the trial a 'mutiny ' .
While Gallagher is yet to comment on the president 's support , his strong ties to the administration and to GOP elite are clear .
One of his lawyers is Marc Mukasey , a former partner of Rudy Giuliani who has also worked for Trump in a personal capacity .
Another is Bernard Kerik , a long-time Trump associate and the former NYPD commissioner who was convicted of ethics violations , tax fraud and false statements .
The case has been eagerly watched by former New York mayor and Trump comrade Rudy Giuliani who has commentated on it on Twitter throughout and maintains there is something 'seriously wrong ' with prosecutors ' efforts to put Gallagher behind bars .
Tim Parlatore , the lead defense attorney , is a Navy veteran who served between 2002 and 2013 .
Gallagher 's wife appealed directly to Trump to free him from the brig . When he was put in barracks , she shared her thanks in a Facebook post .
Gallagher has also received support from strangers and the Navy SEALs Fund which has raised more than $ 730,000 to pay for his defense .
The proceeds of t-shirt sales by three different apparel companies are also contributing to his defense .
Kerik tweeted his support throughout the trial . On Monday , when the jury started deliberating , he tweeted this
Andrea Gallagher , Eddie ' relentless wife and chief supporter who stood by his side through 'farce ' trial and lambasted the 'mean girls ' who testified against him
Gallagher said nothing throughout the nearly year-long process between being indicted and the end of his trial , but his wife Andrea was a constant presence in the media and by his side .
Since he was charged in September 2018 , Andrea , 39 , has relentlessly campaigned for her husband 's exoneration .
She made multiple television appearances , first on Fox News and later , as the trial gathered speed , on Good Morning America to insist on his innocence and condemn prosecutors ' attempts to put him behind bars .

In addition to her media campaign , the glamorous blonde launched social media pages where she shared photographs of their family .
In them , Gallagher is seen hugging their sons and kissing her . The Facebook page has more than 33,000 followers .
Despite SEALs testifying to have witnessed her husband killing the ISIS prisoner , she said in one interview : 'He 's confident . My husband has always maintained his innocence from the beginning ; he has been confident .
'He 's wanted to go to trial . We have waited so long for this opportunity , ' she said .
On it , Andrea has shared photos of herself and Eddie on 'date night ' during the trial .
Andrea has shared photographs of Gallagher with their sons on social media as part of her sustained campaign
On the page , Andrea refers to the men who testified against her husband as 'mean girls '
She earlier called it 'corrupt ' , 'vile ' and a 'farce ' and has referred to the younger SEALs testifying against him as 'Mean Girls . '
She pleaded with the president to intervene when her husband was put in the brig , begging him : 'What is happening here is n't right , and we need your help . '
The pair had been married for 12 years and Andrea says they are lifelong best friends .
The couple have three children together ; a 19-year-old son , a teenage daughter and a 10-year-old son . They live in Florida .
She has previously told how he planned to retire next year , aged 40 , after 20 years in the armed forces .

A decorated Navy SEAL has been acquitted Tuesday of murder in the killing of a wounded Islamic State captive under his care in Iraq in 2017.

The verdict at a military court on Naval Base San Diego was met with an outpouring of emotion as the military jury also cleared Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher, 40, of attempted murder in the shootings of two civilians and all other charges except for posing for photos with the body of the dead captive.

The case exposed a generational conflict within the ranks of the elite special forces group and the outcome dealt a major blow to one of the military's most high-profile war crimes cases.

Outside the court Gallagher greeted the media alongside his wife and lawyers. He spoke briefly saying: 'I'm happy and I'm thankful.

'I thank God, my legal team and my wife.'

According to Fox News he joked with his legal team that 'it's Independence Day'.

His wife Andrea said they are now looking forward to freedom: 'We just want to celebrate today.

'I was feeling like we're finally vindicated after being terrorized by the government that my husband fought for for 20 years.

'I think that this vindication, I hope, will be a lesson learned to everybody, that we need to uphold innocent until proven guilty (and) due process.' ⁣

'If this was a movie no one would believe it.'

The couple drove away from the court in a white convertible Mustang and headed to celebrate with his supporters joking they were heading for 'tattoos and alcohol'.

Defense lawyer Marc Mukasey said Gallagher cried 'tears of joy, emotion, freedom and absolute euphoria'. Family and friends clutched each other in relief in the courtroom.

Mukasey added outside court: 'Suffice it to say this is a huge victory.

'It's a huge weight off the Gallaghers.'

The maximum sentence for posing with a corpse is four months and he spent longer than that in confinement awaiting trial before being freed by President Trump in March therefore he left the court Tuesday.

'We have a sentencing to do, but the maximum sentence of what they're about to sentence him on is much less than the time that they've already had him in the brig,' defense attorney Tim Parlatore said after Tuesday's verdict. 'So he is going home.'

Parlatore said the trial was a 'mutiny' and that he was being set up for the murder of the young ISIS fighter in 2017 by a group of younger SEALs who did not like his tough, old-school leadership style.

'The jury found him not guilty of murder, stabbing, the shootings, not guilty of all those things. They did find him guilty of taking a photo with a dead terrorist which we admitted all along, he's in that photo,' Parlatore added.

At the time they started complaining about him to their superiors, the other SEALs had been back in the US for six months and Gallagher was up for a promotion and a Silver Star.

The turning point in the court martial was when one of the SEALs, Corey Scott, who had been expected to testify for the prosecution took responsibility for killing the boy Gallagher was alleged to have murdered.

Scott now faces perjury charges from the Naval prosecutors he blindsided. They say he made it up to protect Gallagher after being granted immunity for his own war crimes.

Earlier Tuesday Andrea shared a black and white photograph on a Facebook page where she has been keeping fans and followers updated throughout the trial, Andrea Gallagher wrote: 'Please pray for a Not Guilty verdict and the #TRUTH to finally set us Free as the jury deliberates again today so this nightmare can end.'

Prosecutors told them that Gallagher's guilt was clear in photos he took with the dead militant's body.

They also pointed to texts where Gallagher allegedly told friends: 'Got him with my hunting knife' and 'there's a good story behind this', claiming those proved his guilt.

They tried to throw out the confession of another SEAL who took credit for killing the boy, claiming he was lying because he had been given immunity and wanted to protect Gallagher, and said jurors must focus instead on what Gallagher said after the boy's death.

They claim he went off the rails after 19 years in the armed forces and stabbed the boy unexpectedly in front of other SEALs while clearing villages in May 2017.

Gallagher claimed he is not responsible for the boy's death and is being set up by younger, less disciplined SEALs who had it out for him because he had been tough on them on the battlefield.

The defense told jurors that those SEALs were lying when they claimed to have seen him stab the boy angrily.

He was only reported to his supervisors after the other SEALs learned he was up for a promotion and a Silver Star, the third highest honor in the military.

They said there was no evidence, aside from their testimony, that Gallagher committed pre-meditated murder and that he is being set up.

The prosecution needed two-thirds of the jury, or in this case five jurors, to agree to a guilty verdict to convict.

'Navy Cmdr. Jeff Pietrzyk said in closing arguments that text messages by Gallagher show he is guilty.

One message said: 'I've got a cool story for you when I get back. I've got my knife skills on.'

Another text stated: 'Good story behind this. Got him with my hunting knife.'

He then showed a photo of the dead prisoner with Gallagher holding up his head by the hair.

'The government's evidence in this case is Chief Gallagher's words, Chief Gallagher's pictures, Chief Gallagher's SEALs,' Pietrzyk said.

The prosecutor said the witness who changed his story and claimed to have killed the prisoner himself was lying to protect Gallagher.

'He [Corey Scott] changed his account to assist Chief Gallagher. He had his 'I am Spartacus' moment because he thought it would assist Chief Gallagher,' he said.

Pietrzyk acknowledged that the victim is not sympathetic but said the difference between ISIS and the US Army was that Americans did not kill once a fighter was taken out of battle.

'Before the air strike, he would have done anything in his power to kill an American,' Pietrzyk said, but he said the care of war prisoners is what sets U.S. forces apart.

'We're not ISIS. When we capture someone and they're out of the fight, that's it.

'That's where the line is drawn,' Pietrzyk said.

TIMELINE FEBRUARY 2017: Edward Gallagher deploys to Mosul, Iraq, with Alpha platoon SEAL Team 7 MAY 3 2017: Death of ISIS prisoner in Mosul. The 17-year-old had been captured by Iraqi forces and the SEALs were called in to give him medical care because he had a collapsed lung JUNE 18 2017: Gallagher allegedly shoots at unarmed elderly man JULY 2017: Gallagher allegedly shoots a girl SEPTEMBER 2017: SEAL Team 7 returns home MARCH 2018: Seven members of the team call a meeting with troop commander to discuss Gallagher's alleged behavior during deployment Gallagher is given the Bronze Star days later APRIL 2018: Investigation is formally launched SEPTEMBER 2018: Gallagher is charged MARCH 2019: Trump intervenes to remove Gallagher from base confinement and lets him await trial at home MAY 2019: The New York Times reports that Trump is considering pardons for Gallagher and anyone else convicted of war crimes in the trial JUNE 4 2019: Judge removes Cmdr. Christopher Czaplak, the prosecutor, after he admitted to trying to track defense emails JUNE 17 2019: Trial starts in San Diego JUNE 20 2019: Corey Scott says he killed ISIS fighter by covering his breathing tube in an act of mercy to stop him from being tortured by Iraqi forces

During the trial, it was revealed that nearly all the platoon members readily posed for photos with the dead prisoner and watched as Gallagher read his reenlistment oath near the body in an impromptu ceremony.

Defense lawyer Tim Parlatore began his closing argument the same way he started the trial.

'This is case is not about murder, it's about mutiny,' Parlatore said.

He added there were 'gaping holes' in the testimony and said Gallagher was the target of a 'fixation' of military prosecutors.

'They started with a conclusion ... [and] ... ignored everything that didn't fit,' he said.

The attorney said there's no body, no forensics, and the SEALs who testified against Gallagher lied because they didn't like his demanding leadership. He called the pictures of Gallagher clutching the corpse's hair and his texts about his knife skills just the dark humor of a warrior.

Parlatore also contended that investigators never asked Scott about the cause of the death, which is why they were surprised by his testimony.

The defense showed video clips by an Iraq TV crew of the prisoner being interviewed after he was hit, then arriving at the SEAL compound and being handed over to the SEALs by the Iraqi troops.

It also showed Gallagher pulling out his medical bag and treating the detainee.

Gallagher's attorneys said there are a number of things that could have caused the militant's death, including internal injuries from the blast.

Over the last two weeks, seven SEALs have testified against him in the Navy Base in San Diego.

They painted him as a blood thirsty leader who acted like God on the battlefield and thought himself above the law.

But one, who had been expected to testify in favor of the prosecution, stunned the courtroom by taking responsibility for the most serious charge - the murder of the young ISIS prisoner.

It blindsided prosecutors who have now threatened the SEAL with perjury charges. He had been granted immunity for any war crimes in exchange for his testimony.

In their closing arguments on Monday, prosecutors said Gallagher's guilt was undeniable.

THE WAR CRIMES GALLAGHER WAS ACCUSED OF Murder (not guilty) On May 3, SEAL Team 7 was clearing villages near Mosul when they learned that Iraqi forces, which they were helping to fight ISIS, had encountered a young, IS fighter. He was injured and in need of medical care after suffering a collapsed lung in a strike. The boy had been brought into the SEAL compound by a Humvee of Iraqi fighters, the SEALs testified. Gallagher was not at the compound but was out on the field. When he call came over the radio that the boy needed care, Gallagher volunteered. According to witness testimony, he told the Iraqi soldiers not to waste their own medics on caring for the enemy and that he instead would tend to him. 'Lay off him, he's mine,' he is accused of saying. When they got back to the base, some of the SEALs said they saw Gallagher give him medical aid. They then claimed, however, that he took his hunting knife and spontaneously stabbed him twice in the neck and once in the side. One testified that it caused him to bleed so profusely there was blood spurting from his neck. 'It looked similar to a baby throwing up,' said Special Operations Chief Craig Miller. Others say that the last time they saw the militant, he was alive and in Gallagher's care but he was dead when they returned. The testimony which varies greatest is Corey Scott's who said he was the one who killed the boy because he wanted to spare him the torture he faced from Iraqi soldiers. Attempted murder (not guilty) There are two charges of assault on 'noncombatants' listed in the charge sheet. One is against an elderly man who the SEALs say they saw Gallagher shoot from his sniper's nest for no reason. The other is a young, schoolage girl who they say he shot. The SEALs said he claimed to have killed them but it is not clear from the charging sheet if they actually died. According to testimony, he allegedly told them over the radio: 'You guys missed them but I got them.' On another occasion, the SEALs say he shot a different girl, aged between 12 and 14, in the stomach. She was wearing a floral hijab, they said. The defense argued that none of the witnesses actually saw him pull the trigger and that was entirely possible the civilians had been shot by ISIS and not Gallagher. Posing with a corpse, reenlistment ceremony next to a corpse and flying a drone over it (guilty of posing with corpse) Photographs that were shown to the jury showed Gallagher and the other SEALs posing with the corpse of the dead Iraqi fighter once he was dead. He sent the image to friends and boasted about it, according to the SEALs. Not long after he died, Portier reenlisted Gallagher into the Navy next to the boy's corpse which had been covered by a blanket. There was also a charge for flying a drone over it in a disrespectful way once he was dead. The other SEALs participated in all of these three charges which come under the term 'Novel'. The crime is that Gallagher discredited the Navy in his actions. All of the others, with the exception of Portier, were given immunity in exchange for testifying against him. Obstructing justice x 3 (not guilty) Prosecutors allege that Gallagher obstructed justice by trying to stop other SEALs from testifying against him once the investigation was underway and before it began. They say that he threatened them and told them he would kill them if they ever told superiors how he had behaved during the deployment. Unlawfully firing his gun (not guilty) Gallagher allegedly fired his rifle indiscriminately, at least '10 times' than some of the other SEALs said they did, while deployed. Unlawful possession of a controlled substance (dropped before trial) He is accused of having Sustaon 250, a testosterone injection. Prosecutors claimed he was using the steroid improperly. He argued that it was part of a medical kit he had been given to give to others that was discovered during a search of his house. Wrongful use of a controlled substance (dropped before trial) Gallagher also had tramadol, a highly addictive painkiller, which they say he was abusing. He argued that he had long held a prescription for it.

THE PROSECUTION - War crimes including murder, attempted murder, obstruction of justice, conduct unbecoming of an officer - Gallagher was an unhinged 19-year veteran on his 8th tour who thought he was above the law - SEALs testified that he shot indiscriminately at Iraqi civilians including an old man collecting water and a girl - They say he boasted about killing 'hundreds' during his tours and was blood thirsty - When he was indicted, some of the SEALs said they spent more time protecting Iraqi civilians from Gallagher than they did fighting ISIS - They claim Gallagher plunged his knife into ISIS fighter's neck twice and his side once in a sudden attack - Afterwards, he justified it by calling him 'just another ISIS dirtbag' - The SEALs say they had to speak up against him for others' safety

THE DEFENSE - Gallagher is an honorable, life-saving SEAL who has spent nearly 20 years in the military protecting people all over the world - He is a medic and a sniper whose mission is to protect and serve, no matter the mission - In 2017, he was leading a group of less disciplined SEALs during his 8th deployment and they were in Mosul, Iraq - Some were angry that he had been recommended for the Silver Star, the third highest honor in the Navy - He was tough on them, calling them cowards in the battlefield and accusing them of not pulling their weight, and they did not like it - On the day the ISIS prisoner died, Gallagher had given the young boy medical treatment - He made an incision in his throat to give him a breathing tube - However the boy lost his life after that was out of his control

Special Warfare Operator 1st Class Dalton Tolbert

SO1 Dalton Tolbert

When the SEALs returned from Mosul and set up their WhatsApp group, SO1 Dalton Tolbert, who was a sniper during their tour, tried to drum up support from others to report Gallagher.

'I saw Eddie Gallagher shoot at someone who didn't deserve to die. I shot more warning shots to protect civilians [from Eddie] than I ever shot at ISIS,' he said in one message in their WhatsApp group, The Sewing Circle.

He gave one example where he said he saw Gallagher shoot an unarmed elderly Iraqi man in a tunic who had been collecting water from a river.

He claimed he fired a warning shot to try to scare the man away but that Gallagher fired at him and wounded him.

Tolbert had been accepted into the famous SEAL Team 6, which was responsible for taking out Osama Bin Laden.

He said that as a result of his testimony at Gallagher's trial, his dream of carrying out covert operations for that team is now over.

Special Warfare Operator 1st Class Dylan Dille

SO1 Dylan Dille is illustrated above in a shirt and tie, sitting in front of Gallagher, with a photograph in the background of the men crowded around the ISIS fighter once dead

Dille's testimony was some of the most damaging. He claimed that Gallagher told him that he would like to kill an ISIS prisoner if the opportunity arose.

His remarks were what informed the prosecution's arguments that it was a premeditated killing.

Dille claimed that on the day the boy died, he was with Gallagher when the call came over the radio that a prisoner was at the base.

'No one touch him. He's all mine,' he claimed he said.

He said Gallagher had told him earlier: 'If we ever get a wounded enemy, that the medics know what to do to nurse him to death.'

He did not claim to have seen Gallagher kill him. Instead, he said the boy was alive when he left him

He returned to his post and then came back to the group later but found the prisoner dead, he said.

Later that day, he said Gallagher held a meeting with the junior SEALs because they were so uncomfortable with what had happened.

He said that at that meeting, Gallagher told them: 'This was just an ISIS dirtbag. Next time we get a prisoner … it will be out of sight, out of mind.'

Dille served in the Navy from 2010 until last year.

Special Warfare Operator 1st Class Craig Miller

Miller's testimony was among the most dramatic. He said that he saw Gallagher plunge the knife into the boy's neck and that blood spurted out.

'I saw him stab the prisoner in the side of the neck. He kind of like jumped back a little bit,' after the alleged stabbing.

SO1 Craig Miller

'The blood just came out. It looked similar to a baby throwing up,' he said.

Miller was who led The Sewing Circle, according to Parlatore, Gallagher's lawyer.

He was the first to report him to superiors once they had returned from Iraq. It was around the time that Gallagher was up for promotion to Master Chief and he was being considered for the Silver Star, the third highest honor in the armed forces.

Miller first went to Lt. Commander Robert Breisch in around March 2018, when Gallagher was up for the award. He told Breisch that it was based on lies and that he didn't deserve it. When asked why, he first claimed Gallagher stole food from care packages in the platoon.

When he was told that wasn't enough to open an investigation, he claimed Gallagher used dangerous war tactics like using other SEALs as bait.

Again, he was told it was not enough. Over the next five months, Breisch said one of the SEALs went to him every week to complain about Gallagher.

Eventually, in around August 2018, Miller finally claimed he'd stabbed an ISIS prisoner.

'[He] blurted and vomited it out. He said, 'Eddie stabbed a prisoner,'' Breisch testified.

Since they returned, Miller has been promoted to chief.

Special Operator First Class Corey Scott

Scott had been expected to testify in line with the other SEALs and accuse Gallagher of murdering the boy.

But when he got on the witness stand, he blindsided prosecutors and the courtroom by claiming he was the one who killed the ISIS prisoner by closing off his air supply by covering his breathing tube with his thumb.

He said it was an act of mercy because he knew Iraqi forces would torture the young man if he let him live and handed him over.

Corey Scott (in a court sketch) was called as a prosecution witness on Thursday in the case against Gallagher but stunned the prosecutors by taking responsibility for the murder. Now, he is being threatened with perjury charges

Scott and Gallagher were the two medics on the scene and they were closest to the boy when he died.

He said he did see Gallagher stab him but that it was not what ultimately killed him.

Prosecutors have accused him of lying to protect Gallagher and say he only did it because he had been granted immunity himself.

He insisted he was being honest and merely did not want Gallagher, who has a wife and children, to spend the rest of his life in prison.

Scott has since been threatened by Navy prosecutors with perjury charges.

Special Warfare Operator First Class Joshua Vriens

SO1 Joshua Vriens

Vriens testified that he had seen Gallagher shoot a young girl in a hijab and sent others scattering.

He claimed to have watched through his scope as the girl was hit in the stomach and then dragged by one of her friends to safety.

But upon cross-examination, Vriens admitted he only saw it through his own sniper scope and did not see Gallagher pull the trigger.

He also conceded that ISIS had been shooting civilians that day, leaving open the possibility that it could have been one of their snipers who injured the girl.

Special Warfare Operator First Class T.C. Byrne

Byrne testified that he was wearing a helmet fitted with a camera when the ISIS prisoner was brought into the base.

Footage taken from it was shown to the jury. He said that he saw the prisoner alive but that he left him in Gallagher's care and returned to find him dead.

SO1 Terrance 'TC' Byrne is shown pointing to a photo of the dead fighter on the ground

Lt. Thomas MacNeil

MacNeil, who had roomed with Gallagher in the past, was the first to take the stand.

He claimed that after they returned from Mosul and there were rumors of an investigation, Gallagher and Portier approached him in a parking lot where he said Gallagher ran up to him and threatened him.

'Chief Gallagher got in my face and said 'If you take me down, I'll take all of you down. I've got s**t on all of you,' he told the trial.

Lt. Jacob Portier

Portier was the supervisor during the deployment and he has been charged separately for covering up Gallagher's alleged crimes.

He conducted the reenlistment ceremony next to the dead ISIS fighter's body once he had stopped breathing and was also filmed walking past the SEALs as they played with a drone near the youngster's body.

He allegedly ordered the SEALs to delete the incriminating photographs and videos taking during deployment which could put Gallagher behind bars.

Portier's own defense team has claimed, like Gallagher's, that they are being unfairly prosecuted.

At his trial, it was revealed that a repository where alleged war crimes are meant to be logged and then investigated has sat empty since it was created in 2009.

SEALs referred to Gallagher as 'el diablo' and plotted how to bring him down before war crimes trial in secretive WhatsApp group they called 'The Sewing Circle

The Navy SEALs who testified against Gallagher discussed reporting him to their superiors in a secret WhatsApp group called The Sewing Circle for months before he was indicted.

Seven members of the Alpha platoon Seal Team 7 testified against Gallagher at his two-week long trial in San Diego.

They had already spoken at length about why they thought he should no longer be allowed to serve in the military on the group, created after they returned from Mosul in 2017.

One SEAL claimed in their group text that he spent more time protecting civilians 'from Eddie' than he did fighting ISIS

The SEALs were deployed between February and September 2017.

When they returned home, Gallagher was celebrated for his bravery and the Navy was poised to award him the Silver Star, the third highest honor in the military.

News of the award prompted them to speak out.

The SEALs say it was because they could not allow him, in good conscience, to be celebrated when he had behaved in the ways they described.

Gallagher's attorney has suggested they were jealous that he was being recognized and they were not.

Among the messages was one where Corey Scott, the medic who took responsibility for the death of an ISIS prisoner Gallagher was charged with murdering, said he was 'ready to fight and kill.'

Others claimed in the messages to have spent more time trying to save Iraqi civilians from Gallagher than they did fighting ISIS.

How Trump weighed in on trial to get Gallagher better terms and may pardon him if he is convicted and the Navy SEAL's army of Republican support

The case not only made waves in the armed forces, it also caught the attention of prominent politicians and even the president.

Before he went on trial, Trump who intervened to free Gallagher from the brig, the Navy equivalent of prison, and give him better bail terms while he awaited his day in court.

'In honor of his past service to our Country, Navy Seal #EddieGallagher will soon be moved to less restrictive confinement while he awaits his day in court,' the president

'Process should move quickly!' Trump tweeted.

Two months later, it was reported that he would consider pardoning Gallagher should he be convicted.

His interference was the culmination of requests from Republicans to let Gallagher spend precious time with his family, at home, before potentially being jailed for life.

In March, Trump, responding to requests from Republican lawmakers and Gallagher's wife, moved him out of the brig and into less restrictive confinements

Gallagher's team of lawyers includes Marc Mukasey (left), who worked for Trump, and Navy veteran Tim Parlatore (right)

Rudy Giuliani has also weighed in on the case on Twitter, alleging misconduct against prosecutors

'We ask that you weigh this decision given the terrible message Chief Gallagher's confinement sends to our warfighters, that they can be confined behind bars away from their family, legal defense, and community for nine months before their day in court,' the lawmakers asked Navy Region Southwest commander Rear Adm. Yancy B. Lindsey.

Also on his team was Bernard Kerik, the former NYPD commissioner

One was Dan Crenshaw, the Republican representative for Texas who lost an eye fighting in Afghanistan and was a SEAL himself before taking up politics.

The other was Duncan Hunter, a Marine veteran from California.

In their request, they added: 'To confine any service member for that duration of time, regardless of the authority to do so, sends a chilling message to those who fight for our freedoms.'

Their support of Gallagher and concerns about the case are echoed on forums, petitions and support groups where his fans called the trial a 'mutiny'.

While Gallagher is yet to comment on the president's support, his strong ties to the administration and to GOP elite are clear.

One of his lawyers is Marc Mukasey, a former partner of Rudy Giuliani who has also worked for Trump in a personal capacity.

Another is Bernard Kerik, a long-time Trump associate and the former NYPD commissioner who was convicted of ethics violations, tax fraud and false statements.

The case has been eagerly watched by former New York mayor and Trump comrade Rudy Giuliani who has commentated on it on Twitter throughout and maintains there is something 'seriously wrong' with prosecutors' efforts to put Gallagher behind bars.

Tim Parlatore, the lead defense attorney, is a Navy veteran who served between 2002 and 2013.

Gallagher's wife appealed directly to Trump to free him from the brig. When he was put in barracks, she shared her thanks in a Facebook post.

Gallagher has also received support from strangers and the Navy SEALs Fund which has raised more than $730,000 to pay for his defense.

The proceeds of t-shirt sales by three different apparel companies are also contributing to his defense.

Kerik tweeted his support throughout the trial. On Monday, when the jury started deliberating, he tweeted this

Andrea Gallagher, Eddie' relentless wife and chief supporter who stood by his side through 'farce' trial and lambasted the 'mean girls' who testified against him

Gallagher said nothing throughout the nearly year-long process between being indicted and the end of his trial, but his wife Andrea was a constant presence in the media and by his side.

Since he was charged in September 2018, Andrea, 39, has relentlessly campaigned for her husband's exoneration.

She made multiple television appearances, first on Fox News and later, as the trial gathered speed, on Good Morning America to insist on his innocence and condemn prosecutors' attempts to put him behind bars.

In addition to her media campaign, the glamorous blonde launched social media pages where she shared photographs of their family.

In them, Gallagher is seen hugging their sons and kissing her. The Facebook page has more than 33,000 followers.

Andrea's searing confidence throughout was well documented in interviews.

Despite SEALs testifying to have witnessed her husband killing the ISIS prisoner, she said in one interview: 'He's confident. My husband has always maintained his innocence from the beginning; he has been confident.

'He's wanted to go to trial. We have waited so long for this opportunity,' she said.



On it, Andrea has shared photos of herself and Eddie on 'date night' during the trial.

Andrea has shared photographs of Gallagher with their sons on social media as part of her sustained campaign

On the page, Andrea refers to the men who testified against her husband as 'mean girls'

'I will NEVER give up or stop speaking out against the injustices my husband, children, and family have suffered during this horrific ordeal & utter TRAVESTY of JUSTICE,' she captioned the video.

She earlier called it 'corrupt', 'vile' and a 'farce' and has referred to the younger SEALs testifying against him as 'Mean Girls.'

She pleaded with the president to intervene when her husband was put in the brig, begging him: 'What is happening here isn't right, and we need your help.'

When he was released, she thanked him publicly.

The pair had been married for 12 years and Andrea says they are lifelong best friends.

The couple have three children together; a 19-year-old son, a teenage daughter and a 10-year-old son. They live in Florida.

She has previously told how he planned to retire next year, aged 40, after 20 years in the armed forces.

justice,Fox Online News,2,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/05/19/top-obama-adviser-stakes-out-defiant-defense-on-irs-benghazi-ap-scandals/,"Top Obama adviser stakes out defiant defense on IRS, Benghazi, AP scandals",2013-05-19,,"A top White House adviser staked out a defiant defense Sunday on a series of scandals that have hit the Obama administration , going so far as to say it was an “ irrelevant fact ” where the president was the night of the Benghazi terror attacks and saying the Obama administration wouldn ’ t cooperate in “ partisan fishing expeditions ” over IRS officials targeting Tea Party groups .
Dan Pfeiffer went on five Sunday talk shows where he tried to reverse the damage done to the Obama administration this week by a series of scandals . On “ Fox News Sunday ” he tried to hammer home that the president only heard that the IRS unfairly targeted Tea Party groups “ when it came out in the news . ”
Sen. Rand Paul , R-Ky. , who appeared on CNN 's State of the Union , suggested there was a written policy to target political groups opposing the president but when pressed for proof , he was unable to provide details .
On ABC , Pfeiffer said the law governing the targeting of conservative groups was “ irrelevant . ''
“ You don ’ t really mean the law is irrelevant do you ? ” host George Stephanopoulos asked .
Pfeiffer clarified his statement , “ What I mean is that whether it 's legal , or illegal is -- is not important to the fact that it -- that , the conduct as a matter . The Department of Justice said they 're looking into the legality of this . The president is not going to wait for that . We have to make sure it does n't happen again regardless of how that turns out . ”
Earlier this week , a Treasury Department inspector general report revealed that Tea Party and other groups that had been critical of Obama received extra scrutiny when applying for a tax-exempt status from the government . According to the report , IRS agents had not flagged similar liberal or progressive groups .
The incident was traced back to an Ohio IRS office that had singled out conservative groups and held up their applications or demanded information from them like donor information , which is illegal . Many groups would not or could not provide the confidential information and as a result had to suspend their applications .
Pfeiffer also took the bold step of demanding Republicans owe Susan Rice , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , an apology for alleging she played a part in formulating the White House ’ s response to the attacks in Benghazi , Libya , last year that killed four Americans .
Pfeiffer said that the release of more than 100 pages of Benghazi emails and notes show “ beyond a shadow of the doubt ” that accusations she tried to change the narrative of what happened in the attacks were false .
`` And , frankly , I think that many of the Republicans who have been talking about this , now that they have seen the emails , owe Ambassador Rice an apology for the things they said about her in the wake of the attack , ” he said .
He claimed on CBS ' `` Face the Nation '' that the issue of who changed the initial talking points on the attack is `` largely irrelevant . '' The Benghazi emails though did show top State Department officials involved in trying to water down the administration 's initial storyline to remove references to prior security incidents and warnings .
Another scandal hitting the White House this week involved the seizure of two months worth of telephone records of journalists at four Associated Press bureaus including Washington and New York .
AP President and CEO Gary Pruitt criticized the move Sunday , saying the Justice Department ’ s secret subpoenas sent a strong and negative message to sources and made them less willing to talk to AP journalists .
Pruitt said on CBS ’ “ Face the Nation ” it was not only unconstitutional but also damaging to the ideal of a free press in the country .
“ It will hurt , ” he said . “ We ’ re already seeing some impact . Officials are saying they ’ re reluctant to talk . ”
The Justice Department disclosed the seizure of two months of phone records in a letter the AP received May 10 . The letter didn ’ t say why the organization was targeted .

Dan Pfeiffer went on five Sunday talk shows where he tried to reverse the damage done to the Obama administration this week by a series of scandals. On “Fox News Sunday” he tried to hammer home that the president only heard that the IRS unfairly targeted Tea Party groups “when it came out in the news.”

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who appeared on CNN's State of the Union, suggested there was a written policy to target political groups opposing the president but when pressed for proof, he was unable to provide details.

On ABC, Pfeiffer said the law governing the targeting of conservative groups was “irrelevant.""

“You don’t really mean the law is irrelevant do you?” host George Stephanopoulos asked.

Pfeiffer clarified his statement, “What I mean is that whether it's legal, or illegal is -- is not important to the fact that it -- that, the conduct as a matter. The Department of Justice said they're looking into the legality of this. The president is not going to wait for that. We have to make sure it doesn't happen again regardless of how that turns out.”

Earlier this week, a Treasury Department inspector general report revealed that Tea Party and other groups that had been critical of Obama received extra scrutiny when applying for a tax-exempt status from the government. According to the report, IRS agents had not flagged similar liberal or progressive groups.

The incident was traced back to an Ohio IRS office that had singled out conservative groups and held up their applications or demanded information from them like donor information, which is illegal. Many groups would not or could not provide the confidential information and as a result had to suspend their applications.

Pfeiffer also took the bold step of demanding Republicans owe Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, an apology for alleging she played a part in formulating the White House’s response to the attacks in Benghazi, Libya, last year that killed four Americans.

Pfeiffer said that the release of more than 100 pages of Benghazi emails and notes show “beyond a shadow of the doubt” that accusations she tried to change the narrative of what happened in the attacks were false.

""And, frankly, I think that many of the Republicans who have been talking about this, now that they have seen the emails, owe Ambassador Rice an apology for the things they said about her in the wake of the attack,” he said.

He claimed on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that the issue of who changed the initial talking points on the attack is ""largely irrelevant."" The Benghazi emails though did show top State Department officials involved in trying to water down the administration's initial storyline to remove references to prior security incidents and warnings.

Another scandal hitting the White House this week involved the seizure of two months worth of telephone records of journalists at four Associated Press bureaus including Washington and New York.

AP President and CEO Gary Pruitt criticized the move Sunday, saying the Justice Department’s secret subpoenas sent a strong and negative message to sources and made them less willing to talk to AP journalists.

Pruitt said on CBS’ “Face the Nation” it was not only unconstitutional but also damaging to the ideal of a free press in the country.

“It will hurt,” he said. “We’re already seeing some impact. Officials are saying they’re reluctant to talk.”

The Justice Department disclosed the seizure of two months of phone records in a letter the AP received May 10. The letter didn’t say why the organization was targeted. Last week, Pruitt had said in a statement on the AP website that it was difficult to defend its actions since it was not told by the government what it did or what prompted the subpoenas.

Prosecutors later said they were looking into government leaks on a foiled Al Qaeda plot in Yemen before it was made public last year. Justice officials also alleged the AP’s story would have put Americans at risk, a claim the AP strongly refuted.

Many legal experts say there was nothing illegal about Mr. Comey ’ s actions , given that the material wasn ’ t classified and that he was no longer a government employee .

Latest attack on Sessions

JUST WATCHED Sessions under renewed scrutiny over Russia Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Sessions under renewed scrutiny over Russia 02:41

Trump's scathing tweet is the latest in a long line of public rebukes the President has leveled against his attorney general, a man who broke with much of his party to endorse Trump early in his presidential run.

Trump's anger toward Sessions stems from his decision to recuse himself from all investigations into the 2016 campaign, including special counsel Robert Mueller's expanding investigation into collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian operatives bent on meddling in the election. Sessions made that decision after he did not fully answer questions during his confirmation hearing about his conversations with Russian diplomats during the 2016 campaign. Trump, in turn, has said he wouldn't have named Sessions to lead the Justice Department had he known he would have recused himself.

That animosity has played out publicly ever since.

Trump pestered Sessions for not looking into Hillary Clinton's deleted emails, slammed him for being ""very weak"" on Clinton's ""crimes"" and labeled him ""beleaguered"" in July.

As pressure mounted on Sessions last year, his standing in the administration appeared untenable to people inside the West Wing. During the first six months of Trump's presidency, Trump asked for Sessions' resignation, called the attorney general an ""idiot"" but then later declined to accept his attorney general's resignation letter.

Sessions has so far weathered the incessant incoming from the White House and sources close to the attorney general have told CNN that he is unlikely to go anywhere soon. But the saga between the two top Republicans has played out in public for much of Trump's first year in office and the President's chronic antipathy towards the top law enforcement official has defined Trump's view of the Justice Department.

Trump's anger boiled over in June, too, when the President pushed then-chief of staff Reince Priebus to obtain Sessions' resignation, according sources familiar with the exchange. Priebus later said that he talked Trump out of the firing.

The latest chapter in the saga between Trump and Sessions came just one week ago, when Trump challenged Sessions to launch an investigation into the Obama administration for failing to do enough to stop the 2016 election foreign interference.",www.cnn.com,left,JA8N9llMKlxvkxqT

The group had been charged for their occupation of a federal wildlife sanctuary earlier this year .
Led by militiaman Ammon Bundy , they began their 40 day siege with the promise that they were willing to “ kill and be killed , if necessary , ” to protest government control of land .
It all takes place in the context of a wild presidential campaign , during which Donald Trump has legitimized radical anti-government sentiment , such as his claim that the presidential election was rigged against him . And it also occurs during a time of rapid , nationwide proliferation of these extreme groups .
The Oregon jury made the decision to acquit the seven individuals despite there being ample evidence that they were guilty : they were cleared despite ample photo and video evidence of their occupation , and their public declaration that they would be carrying it out .
The verdict has deep implications that will stretch far beyond the eastern side of Oregon , where the standoff occurred , as it could embolden America ’ s most radical anti-government activists all across the nation .
The number of extreme anti-government groups have have exploded since President Obama took office , from 150 groups to now well above 1,000 , according to the Southern Poverty Law Center .
Many of these individuals have “ deep seated fears of a possible Clinton presidency… if Trump were to lose , that could spark God knows what kind of violence or domestic terrorism , ” said Heidi Beirich , who heads the SPLC ’ s Intelligence Project , an initiative which tracks the nation ’ s hate and hardline anti-government groups .

That’s the signal sent by an Oregon jury after they acquitted seven armed anti-government demonstrators Thursday, legal observers say. The group had been charged for their occupation of a federal wildlife sanctuary earlier this year.

Led by militiaman Ammon Bundy, they began their 40 day siege with the promise that they were willing to “kill and be killed, if necessary,” to protest government control of land.

It all takes place in the context of a wild presidential campaign, during which Donald Trump has legitimized radical anti-government sentiment, such as his claim that the presidential election was rigged against him. And it also occurs during a time of rapid, nationwide proliferation of these extreme groups.

The Oregon jury made the decision to acquit the seven individuals despite there being ample evidence that they were guilty: they were cleared despite ample photo and video evidence of their occupation, and their public declaration that they would be carrying it out.

The verdict has deep implications that will stretch far beyond the eastern side of Oregon, where the standoff occurred, as it could embolden America’s most radical anti-government activists all across the nation.

The number of extreme anti-government groups have have exploded since President Obama took office, from 150 groups to now well above 1,000, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.

Many of these individuals have “deep seated fears of a possible Clinton presidency… if Trump were to lose, that could spark God knows what kind of violence or domestic terrorism,” said Heidi Beirich, who heads the SPLC’s Intelligence Project, an initiative which tracks the nation’s hate and hardline anti-government groups.

“Now a jury has let them walk for taking over public lands by force. The signal to these folks is that they are right and the government is wrong… that is a frightening situation,” she added. “This is a growing movement that is probably going to grow more due to this verdict because they have shown they can use armed interventions and not be punished for them.”

And it was all part of the plan.

“I personally heard Ammon Bundy state clearly and unapologetically that his intent was to use the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge as an example to other groups that are ‘on the edge’ that they can seize federal property and that the government will back down,” said Peter Walker, a University of Oregon professor who is writing a book on the standoff.

Jackson","Congress Sessions could face legal ordeal over testimony Lawyers say he 's at greater risk if a special counsel takes over Trump-Russia probe
Even if Attorney General Jeff Sessions did n't commit perjury during his confirmation hearing , Sessions could still be in other kinds of legal trouble for failing to tell his Senate colleagues that he met the Russian ambassador on two occasions during the heat of the presidential campaign .
`` It is , at best , very misleading testimony , '' said Richard Painter , formerly the top ethics lawyer in President George W. Bush 's White House . `` I do n't go so far as to say that it 's perjury , but there is a lesser charge of failing to provide accurate information to Congress . ''
`` A nominee at a confirmation hearing has an obligation to provide full and complete information to Congress , '' Painter continued . `` Conduct that might be just short of perjury in a deposition in a typical civil case is entirely inappropriate in front of Congress . ''
However , such misdemeanor charges are usually only rolled out as part of a plea deal after prosecutors obtain or threaten more serious felony perjury charges . Some lawyers say those would be a stretch in Sessions ' case .
`` Perjury is very hard to prove , '' said former House Counsel Stan Brand , who worked for the Democrats . `` You have to prove two elements that are very difficult in the Congressional context : one is intent and two is an absolutely clear and unambiguous question . ''
How Sessions ' statements fit into the typical rubric is somewhat unclear . While Sen. Al Franken 's question to Sessions was fairly clear , it was also a query about his future plans , and therefore almost incapable of generating a direct answer that would amount to perjury .
Sessions ' arguably erroneous statement was the kind of rhetorical detour counsel often tells their clients not to take when testifying : a gratuitous response that was n't really called for by the question .
After a wind-up about breaking press reports on alleged contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian agents , Franken asked : `` if there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign , what will you do ? ''
Sessions replied : `` Senator Franken , I 'm not aware of any of those activities . I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did n't have — did not have communications with the Russians , and I 'm unable to comment on it . ''
Senator Patrick Leahy followed up with a written question asking Sessions if had `` been in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election , either before or after election day ? ''
During a press conference at the Justice Department Thursday , the attorney general insisted he had no intention to deceive the committee .
`` My reply to the question of Sen. Franken was honest and correct as I understood it at the time . I appreciate that some have taken the view that this was a false comment . That is not my intent . That is not correct , '' the attorney general declared .
However , later in the exchange with reporters , Sessions said he could not rule out the possibility that he discussed election-related matters during his September meeting with the Russian diplomat , Sergey Kislyak .
`` I do n't recall , but most of these ambassadors are pretty gossipy , and .... this was in the campaign season , but I do n't recall any specific political discussions , '' the attorney general said .
Sessions ' initial denial could be legally problematic if it is contradicted by staffers at the meeting or by other evidence , such as intercepts of Russian reports on what was said , attorneys said .
One unpleasant parallel for Sessions comes from the prolonged confirmation hearings of Attorney General Richard Kleindienst in 1972 .
During those hearings , Kleindienst denied that he 'd received instructions from anyone at the White House about how to handle a high-profile antitrust investigation into ITT Corp .
`` I was not interfered with by anybody at the White House , '' he said repeatedly .
A year later , tapes emerged of President Richard Nixon himself instructing Kleindienst to drop the case .
Kleindienst resigned less than a year into his tenure as attorney general . Prosecutors considered indicting him on multiple perjury counts , but he ultimately pled guilty to a misdemeanor charge of contempt of Congress for refusing to answer a question — a charge some considered a poor fit .
`` It 's a bastardized version of a false statement charge , '' Brand said .
Other prominent government officials have also pled guilty to the same charge , including former CIA Director Richard Helms in 1977 for testimony about CIA operations in Chile and State Department aide Elliott Abrams in 1991 for testimony obscuring aspects of the Iran-Contra affair .
Other officials have gotten a pass for their misleading testimony , including former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper for denying that the government was engaged in widespread surveillance of Americans .
`` Does the [ National Security Agency ] collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans ? '' committee member Sen. Ron Wyden ( D-Ore. ) asked Clapper during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing .
`` No , sir , '' Clapper replied . `` There are cases where they could inadvertently perhaps collect [ intelligence on Americans ] , but not wittingly . ''

Revelations from NSA leaker Edward Snowden just a few months later made clear that the NSA was sweeping up data on billions and billions of phone calls made by Americans .
Clapper said he misunderstood the question , which he thought referred to surveillance beyond collecting metadata on phone calls .
`` My response was clearly erroneous , '' he wrote in an apology letter to Congress .
Clapper was repeatedly questioned by lawmakers and the media about his misstatement , but he never faced criminal charges . He stayed in his job until Obama 's final day in office .
When Congressional witnesses face attention-grabbing perjury charges , prosecutors sometimes end up with egg on their faces . In 2010 , Major League Baseball pitcher Roger Clemens was indicted for lying in 2008 Congressional testimony where he denied any involvement with steroids .
At a trial in Washington in 2012 , jurors acquitted Clemens on all counts .
Veteran defense attorneys said that whatever the chances are that Sessions faces charges over his testimony , they increase if a special prosecutor — especially one from outside the department — is appointed to examine the attorney general 's statements as well as other matters related to alleged Russian influence in the election .
`` As a defense attorney , I 'd rather have a U.S. attorney , '' Brand said .
When Sessions recused himself Thursday from investigations related to the 2016 presidential campaign , he apparently also surrendered any role in deciding whether a special prosecutor takes over that probe and any inquiry into Sessions ' testimony .
For the moment , acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente will oversee those matters . However , the ultimate decision could be made by the man Trump has nominated to hold that No . 2 job on a permanent basis , Rod Rosenstein .
Rosenstein faces a Senate confirmation hearing Tuesday where Sessions ' testimony and the potential for a special prosecutor are now expected to take center stage .
Some legal experts say the independent counsel probe that could spell the most trouble for Sessions is the only appropriate course now that his conduct is in question .
“ Sessions recused himself . But his subordinates can not conduct the investigation of their boss , ” said New York University law professor Stephen Gillers , a legal ethics specialist . “ They are not independent . A special prosecutor , who can not be removed except for cause , is needed . ”","Congress Sessions could face legal ordeal over testimony Lawyers say he's at greater risk if a special counsel takes over Trump-Russia probe

Sessions replied: ""Senator Franken, I'm not aware of any of those activities. I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I didn't have — did not have communications with the Russians, and I'm unable to comment on it.""

Senator Patrick Leahy followed up with a written question asking Sessions if had ""been in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election, either before or after election day?""

Sessions replied, simply: ""No.""

During a press conference at the Justice Department Thursday, the attorney general insisted he had no intention to deceive the committee.

""My reply to the question of Sen. Franken was honest and correct as I understood it at the time. I appreciate that some have taken the view that this was a false comment. That is not my intent. That is not correct,"" the attorney general declared.

However, later in the exchange with reporters, Sessions said he could not rule out the possibility that he discussed election-related matters during his September meeting with the Russian diplomat, Sergey Kislyak.

""I don't recall, but most of these ambassadors are pretty gossipy, and....this was in the campaign season, but I don't recall any specific political discussions,"" the attorney general said.

Sessions' initial denial could be legally problematic if it is contradicted by staffers at the meeting or by other evidence, such as intercepts of Russian reports on what was said, attorneys said.

One unpleasant parallel for Sessions comes from the prolonged confirmation hearings of Attorney General Richard Kleindienst in 1972.

During those hearings, Kleindienst denied that he'd received instructions from anyone at the White House about how to handle a high-profile antitrust investigation into ITT Corp.

""I was not interfered with by anybody at the White House,"" he said repeatedly.

A year later, tapes emerged of President Richard Nixon himself instructing Kleindienst to drop the case.

Kleindienst resigned less than a year into his tenure as attorney general. Prosecutors considered indicting him on multiple perjury counts, but he ultimately pled guilty to a misdemeanor charge of contempt of Congress for refusing to answer a question — a charge some considered a poor fit.

""It's a bastardized version of a false statement charge,"" Brand said.

Other prominent government officials have also pled guilty to the same charge, including former CIA Director Richard Helms in 1977 for testimony about CIA operations in Chile and State Department aide Elliott Abrams in 1991 for testimony obscuring aspects of the Iran-Contra affair.

Other officials have gotten a pass for their misleading testimony, including former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper for denying that the government was engaged in widespread surveillance of Americans.

""Does the [National Security Agency] collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?"" committee member Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) asked Clapper during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing.

""No, sir,"" Clapper replied. ""There are cases where they could inadvertently perhaps collect [intelligence on Americans], but not wittingly.""

Revelations from NSA leaker Edward Snowden just a few months later made clear that the NSA was sweeping up data on billions and billions of phone calls made by Americans.

Clapper said he misunderstood the question, which he thought referred to surveillance beyond collecting metadata on phone calls.

""My response was clearly erroneous,"" he wrote in an apology letter to Congress.

Clapper was repeatedly questioned by lawmakers and the media about his misstatement, but he never faced criminal charges. He stayed in his job until Obama's final day in office.

When Congressional witnesses face attention-grabbing perjury charges, prosecutors sometimes end up with egg on their faces. In 2010, Major League Baseball pitcher Roger Clemens was indicted for lying in 2008 Congressional testimony where he denied any involvement with steroids.

At a trial in Washington in 2012, jurors acquitted Clemens on all counts.

Veteran defense attorneys said that whatever the chances are that Sessions faces charges over his testimony, they increase if a special prosecutor — especially one from outside the department — is appointed to examine the attorney general's statements as well as other matters related to alleged Russian influence in the election.

""As a defense attorney, I'd rather have a U.S. attorney,"" Brand said.

When Sessions recused himself Thursday from investigations related to the 2016 presidential campaign, he apparently also surrendered any role in deciding whether a special prosecutor takes over that probe and any inquiry into Sessions' testimony.

For the moment, acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente will oversee those matters. However, the ultimate decision could be made by the man Trump has nominated to hold that No. 2 job on a permanent basis, Rod Rosenstein.

Rosenstein faces a Senate confirmation hearing Tuesday where Sessions' testimony and the potential for a special prosecutor are now expected to take center stage.

Some legal experts say the independent counsel probe that could spell the most trouble for Sessions is the only appropriate course now that his conduct is in question.

“Sessions recused himself. But his subordinates cannot conduct the investigation of their boss,” said New York University law professor Stephen Gillers, a legal ethics specialist. “They are not independent. A special prosecutor, who cannot be removed except for cause, is needed.”",www.politico.com,left,qjWHjuIBo9eSGW68

''
During a particularly devastating moment during his testimony to members of the House Judiciary Committee , Floyd sobbed as he discussed how tragic it was that his brother 's death in police custody last month would be available for children to watch online forever — and described the intense pain his whole family is feeling .
`` The rest of my life … it ’ s all people will talk about , '' he said , as tears rolled down his cheeks . `` Kids have to watch the video . His kids have to watch the video . It just hurts . It ’ s a lot of pain . ''
Describing his family , Floyd said they `` they just cry , cry every day and ask 'why ? ' ''
`` He pleaded for his life . He said he could n't breathe . He pleaded for his life , '' Floyd said . `` Justice has to be served . ''
`` Anyone with a heart , they know that that 's wrong . You don ’ t do that to a human being . You don ’ t do that to an animal , '' Floyd continued . `` All lives matter , black lives matter . ''
Floyd said the officers who killed his brothers `` have to be convicted . ''
Earlier , Floyd provided excruciating details about having to watch the video of his brother dying .
`` I ca n't tell you the kind of pain you feel when you watch something like that — when you watch your big brother , who you looked up to your whole entire life , die , die begging for his mom , '' he said .
`` I 'm here to ask you to make it stop . Stop the pain , stop us from being tired , '' he added . `` George called for help , and he was ignored . Please listen to the call I 'm making to you now , to the calls of our family , and the calls ringing out in the streets across the world . ''

At another point , he criticized his brother 's death in police custody as a `` modern-day lynching in broad daylight . ''
The hearing on police brutality and racial profiling comes as lawmakers consider a policing overhaul bill proposed by Democrats and a day after a funeral service was held in Houston for George Floyd , who died last month after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes during his arrest .
Philonise said in his opening statement that he was testifying to make sure his older brother 's death will not be in vain .
`` If his death ends up changing the world for the better — and I think it will , I think it has — then he died as he lived . It is on you to make sure his death isn ’ t in vain , '' he said .
During another emotionally charged moment , Floyd said he often wondered whether police might kill him next .
“ Every day I walk around , I ask myself . Am I next ? ” Floyd said later in the hearing , responding to questions about the fact that African Americans are stopped by police , and arrested and killed , at disproportionate rates .
He described himself as , “ just a black man trying to go to work every day and go back home safely . ”
During the question-and-answer part of the hearing , Floyd was asked if Derek Chauvin , the officer who killed his brother ( and who had , over the course of his career on the Minneapolis Police Department , been the subject of over a dozen police conduct complaints ) , should have been terminated from the force long ago .
“ Any officer that acts like that shouldn ’ t be able to get a job , ” Floyd said .
Earlier during the hearing , Rep. Jim Jordan , R-Ohio , the panel 's ranking member , said George Floyd 's death is a tragedy and `` never should have happened , '' but added that he opposed the calls by some activists to defund police departments .
`` The vast , vast majority of law enforcement officers are responsible , hard-working , heroic first responders , '' Jordan said . `` They 're the officers who protect the Capitol , who protect us every single day . They ’ re the officers who rushed into the twin towers on 9/11 . ''
The Floyd family 's lawyer , Ben Crump , was also among the dozen witnesses testifying at the hearing . He said `` changing the behavior of police and their relationships with people of color starts at the top . ''
`` We need a national standard for police and behavior built on transparency and accountability , '' said Crump , adding that it should be mandatory for police officers to wear body cameras . `` The only reason we know what happened to George Floyd is because it was captured on video . The advent of video evidence is bringing into the light what long was hidden . This revealing what black Americans have known for a long , long time : that it is dangerous for a black person to have an encounter with a police officer . ''
Later , Crump said that Floyd 's death `` gives us the best opportunity I have seen since I have been doing this for us to get real change , systematic reform to effect how police treat people of culture , especially black people . ''
Other witnesses include experts and advocates including Marc Morial , president and CEO of the National Urban League and a former mayor of New Orleans . Republicans have invited several witnesses , including Daniel Bongino , a former Secret Service agent who is a conservative radio host who often appears on Fox News .
Their testimony comes as the committee prepares to next week mark up the Justice and Policing Act , the policing overhaul legislation unveiled by Democrats amid protests that have swept the nation over the last two weeks since Floyd ’ s death .
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , D-Md. , told reporters Tuesday that Democrats aim to hold a floor vote on the measure during the week of June 22 . Hoyer urged Republicans to work with Democrats on crafting the final version by proposing amendments during the committee markup .
The legislation , which Democrats say would increase police accountability and transparency , would ban chokeholds , including the kind used by a then-Minneapolis police officer in Floyd 's death on May 25 , as well as no-knock warrants in drug cases , as was used in the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor in Louisville , Kentucky , in March .
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , said Tuesday that he has put Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina , the only black Republican in the Senate , in charge of leading a group to respond to the events surrounding Floyd 's death . White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and the president 's son-in-law , Jared Kushner , met with Scott on Capitol Hill on Tuesday afternoon to discuss the proposal .
Scott 's draft proposal is focused on collecting data on such things as use of force and conducting studies to determine best practices , but would not ban chokeholds and no-knock warrants as the Democrats ' bill would .

justice,BBC News,1,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46487122,William Barr nominated by Donald Trump to be US attorney general,,,"President Donald Trump has nominated William Barr to be the new attorney general , a post he held in the 1990s .
By replacing Jeff Sessions , who was fired by Mr Trump last month , the 68-year-old will take charge of the investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 US election .
US media report he has been critical of some aspects of that inquiry .
A well-known conservative lawyer , Mr Barr held the role under President George H W Bush from 1991 to 1993 .
The president called him a `` highly respected lawyer '' by both Republicans and Democrats and `` a terrific man '' while speaking to reporters on the White House South Lawn .
In the same statement , Mr Trump confirmed reports he is pushing for Heather Nauert to be the new US ambassador to the United Nations .
Currently , Mr Barr is counsel at the Kirkland & Ellis law firm in Washington DC .
If Mr Barr is confirmed by the senate after his official nomination , he will replace the current acting attorney general , Matt Whitaker .
Mr Whitaker had been a controversial pick from the start due to his views on Special Counsel Robert Mueller 's inquiry .
Mr Trump has repeatedly lashed out at the investigation , calling it a `` witch hunt '' .
When he selected Mr Whitaker to replace Jeff Sessions , who had recused himself from the inquiry , Democrats feared Mr Whitaker would bring an end to the special counsel 's work .
Democrats say they will definitely press Mr Barr on his views regarding protecting Mr Mueller and his work , during his confirmation hearings .
On paper William Barr looks like a safe pick for US attorney general . Since serving under George HW Bush , he 's spent most of his career as a corporate lawyer , so he 's more than familiar with Washington 's corridors of power .
Mr Barr is the kind of nominee Senate Republicans - whose votes will be needed for confirmation - know and are comfortable with . He 's not exactly a drain-the-Washington-swamp choice , but that has never been a priority in the gilded halls of the upper chamber of Congress .
This , of course , is no normal time - and it did n't take long for interested parties to scour Mr Barr 's recent comments and writings in search of any meaningful hints on how he would oversee Robert Mueller 's Russia investigation .
Democrats wo n't be encouraged to learn that he expressed support for Donald Trump 's firing of FBI Director James Comey and recommended further investigation of Democrat Hillary Clinton .
It 's going to be months before Mr Barr receives a Senate vote , and the scouring will surely continue . Contentious confirmation hearings are all but a given . This , however , is a nomination that will be difficult for Democrats to derail .
The 68-year-old Republican lawyer has an impressive political resume , spanning the CIA , White House and Department of Justice .
Mr Barr holds degrees in government and Chinese studies from Columbia University .
While studying law at George Washington University , he worked at the CIA from 1973-1977 .
As a young lawyer , he clerked for the DC appeals court .
For a year , Mr Barr was a member of President Ronald Reagan 's domestic policy staff at the White House ; a role he eventually left to pursue corporate law .
In 1989 , he was appointed by President Bush to head the Justice Department 's Office of Legal Counsel . He was promoted to deputy attorney general next , and then to the top role .
After passing his senate confirmation hearing unanimously , he served as the 77th US attorney general from 1991-1993 .
As the top US law official at that time , he oversaw Robert Mueller , who was then leading the department 's criminal division .
Mr Barr retired from his position as counsel and executive vice-president of Verizon in 2008 .
Mr Barr has voiced disapproval over some aspects of the inquiry but his views on the investigation 's legitimacy remain unknown .
He has said that Robert Mueller hired too many prosecutors with Democratic campaign ties for his investigative team - telling the Washington Post he `` would have liked to see [ Mueller ] have more balance '' .
In a 2017 opinion piece for the Post , Mr Barr said Mr Trump had been right to fire FBI director James Comey because he `` crossed a line '' by announcing the outcome of the investigation into Hillary Clinton 's emails .
He has also defended Mr Trump 's desire for a criminal investigation against Hillary Clinton to the New York Times , adding that some of her actions merited an inquiry more than any Trump-Russia collusion .
The Times has described Mr Barr as a lawyer with a vision for broad presidential powers , but also one who sees the attorney general 's duty as avoiding political considerations .
On Twitter , many are wondering why Mr Barr chose to accept the role again , and what he might make of Mr Trump 's latest tweets deriding the Russian inquiry .
Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal has already called for Mr Barr to firmly commit to protect Mr Mueller 's investigation .
Skip Twitter post by @ SenBlumenthal Barr must firmly commit to protect the Special Counsel , operate independently of the WH , & uphold the rule of law . The Senate must scrutinize this nominee , in light of comments suggesting he was more interested in currying favor with Trump than objectively analyzing law & facts . https : //t.co/yZbx31dZOv — Richard Blumenthal ( @ SenBlumenthal ) December 7 , 2018 Report
Fellow Democrat Patrick Leahy of Vermont said he has known Mr Barr a long time and hopes he will `` unambiguously commit '' to protecting the inquiry and upholding the law .

President Donald Trump has nominated William Barr to be the new attorney general, a post he held in the 1990s.

By replacing Jeff Sessions, who was fired by Mr Trump last month, the 68-year-old will take charge of the investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 US election.

US media report he has been critical of some aspects of that inquiry.

A well-known conservative lawyer, Mr Barr held the role under President George H W Bush from 1991 to 1993.

The president called him a ""highly respected lawyer"" by both Republicans and Democrats and ""a terrific man"" while speaking to reporters on the White House South Lawn.

In the same statement, Mr Trump confirmed reports he is pushing for Heather Nauert to be the new US ambassador to the United Nations.

Currently, Mr Barr is counsel at the Kirkland & Ellis law firm in Washington DC.

If Mr Barr is confirmed by the senate after his official nomination, he will replace the current acting attorney general, Matt Whitaker.

Mr Whitaker had been a controversial pick from the start due to his views on Special Counsel Robert Mueller's inquiry.

Mr Trump has repeatedly lashed out at the investigation, calling it a ""witch hunt"".

When he selected Mr Whitaker to replace Jeff Sessions, who had recused himself from the inquiry, Democrats feared Mr Whitaker would bring an end to the special counsel's work.

Democrats say they will definitely press Mr Barr on his views regarding protecting Mr Mueller and his work, during his confirmation hearings.

Will Democrats derail his appointment?

Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington

On paper William Barr looks like a safe pick for US attorney general. Since serving under George HW Bush, he's spent most of his career as a corporate lawyer, so he's more than familiar with Washington's corridors of power.

Mr Barr is the kind of nominee Senate Republicans - whose votes will be needed for confirmation - know and are comfortable with. He's not exactly a drain-the-Washington-swamp choice, but that has never been a priority in the gilded halls of the upper chamber of Congress.

This, of course, is no normal time - and it didn't take long for interested parties to scour Mr Barr's recent comments and writings in search of any meaningful hints on how he would oversee Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.

Democrats won't be encouraged to learn that he expressed support for Donald Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey and recommended further investigation of Democrat Hillary Clinton.

It's going to be months before Mr Barr receives a Senate vote, and the scouring will surely continue. Contentious confirmation hearings are all but a given. This, however, is a nomination that will be difficult for Democrats to derail.

Who is William Barr?

The 68-year-old Republican lawyer has an impressive political resume, spanning the CIA, White House and Department of Justice.

Mr Barr holds degrees in government and Chinese studies from Columbia University.

While studying law at George Washington University, he worked at the CIA from 1973-1977.

As a young lawyer, he clerked for the DC appeals court.

For a year, Mr Barr was a member of President Ronald Reagan's domestic policy staff at the White House; a role he eventually left to pursue corporate law.

In 1989, he was appointed by President Bush to head the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel. He was promoted to deputy attorney general next, and then to the top role.

After passing his senate confirmation hearing unanimously, he served as the 77th US attorney general from 1991-1993.

As the top US law official at that time, he oversaw Robert Mueller, who was then leading the department's criminal division.

Mr Barr retired from his position as counsel and executive vice-president of Verizon in 2008.

What has he said about the Russia inquiry?

Mr Barr has voiced disapproval over some aspects of the inquiry but his views on the investigation's legitimacy remain unknown.

He has said that Robert Mueller hired too many prosecutors with Democratic campaign ties for his investigative team - telling the Washington Post he ""would have liked to see [Mueller] have more balance"".

In a 2017 opinion piece for the Post, Mr Barr said Mr Trump had been right to fire FBI director James Comey because he ""crossed a line"" by announcing the outcome of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails.

He has also defended Mr Trump's desire for a criminal investigation against Hillary Clinton to the New York Times, adding that some of her actions merited an inquiry more than any Trump-Russia collusion.

The Times has described Mr Barr as a lawyer with a vision for broad presidential powers, but also one who sees the attorney general's duty as avoiding political considerations.

What's the reaction?

On Twitter, many are wondering why Mr Barr chose to accept the role again, and what he might make of Mr Trump's latest tweets deriding the Russian inquiry.

Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal has already called for Mr Barr to firmly commit to protect Mr Mueller's investigation.

Skip Twitter post by @SenBlumenthal Barr must firmly commit to protect the Special Counsel, operate independently of the WH, & uphold the rule of law. The Senate must scrutinize this nominee, in light of comments suggesting he was more interested in currying favor with Trump than objectively analyzing law & facts. https://t.co/yZbx31dZOv — Richard Blumenthal (@SenBlumenthal) December 7, 2018 Report

Fellow Democrat Patrick Leahy of Vermont said he has known Mr Barr a long time and hopes he will ""unambiguously commit"" to protecting the inquiry and upholding the law.

Mr Leahy was a senator during Mr Barr's first confirmation.

Republicans, meanwhile, have praised Mr Trump's pick.

justice,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/2/12/18184070/maximum-prison-sentence-cap-mass-incarceration,The case for capping all prison sentences at 20 years,2019-02-12,German Lopez,"America puts more people in jail and prison than any other country in the world . Although the country has managed to slightly reduce its prison population in recent years , mass incarceration remains a fact of the US criminal justice system .
It ’ s time for a radical idea that could really begin to reverse mass incarceration : capping all prison sentences at no more than 20 years . It may sound like an extreme , even dangerous , proposal , but there ’ s good reason to believe it would help reduce the prison population without making America any less safe .
In the 1980s and ’ 90s , American officials by and large believed the country was in the middle of a crime wave and an underincarceration crisis ; they responded by increasing the length of prison sentences , enacting new mandatory minimums , and restricting the use of parole . Today , with crime rates lower , Americans more readily believe that the country has an overincarceration problem — one that disproportionately afflicts minority communities , as black and brown people are far more likely to be locked up than their white peers .
Given the impact that mass incarceration has had , there ’ s a strong case that the US should take steps to ensure that it doesn ’ t ever lock up so many people again .
Looking at the length of our prison sentences is one approach to reverse mass incarceration . Empirical research has consistently found that locking up people for very long periods of time does little to nothing to combat crime , and may actually lead to more crime as people spend more time in prison — missing big life opportunities for legitimate careers , and being incarcerated with others who have ties to the criminal world .
There ’ s also good reason to believe that 20 years is a good cutoff for a maximum . Studies have found that people almost always age out of crime , particularly by their late 30s and 40s . If a person is locked up for a robbery or murder at 21 , there ’ s a very good chance that he won ’ t commit that same crime when he gets out at 41 .
Other countries show this can work . European nations tend to have shorter prison sentences than the US , and certainly fewer people in prison , along with roughly equal or lower violent crime rates . Norway in particular caps the great majority of prison sentences at 21 years — and its violent crime and reoffending rates are lower than the US ’ s . ( The cap does have some exceptions , as I ’ ll explain later . )
A cap on prison sentences wouldn ’ t on its own end mass incarceration . But at least tens of thousands of people in prison would benefit now — if the change were applied retroactively — and untold numbers more would benefit in the future if it were adopted by states and the federal government .
I ’ m not naive ; I know there ’ s a very , very low chance that this policy will actually be enacted . And I know there are some difficult questions we need to confront if such a policy were ever put in place .
But I think pushing for something like this is a good idea anyway . It forces a conversation about what prisons are for : Are they for keeping the public safe ? Rehabilitating inmates ? Purely for revenge ? If our answer as a society is the first two , but not the latter , then a cap is something we should consider .
By beginning these kinds of conversations , we can try to get at the root cultural and social forces that enabled and encouraged mass incarceration to begin with . Only by doing that can we start to really unravel a criminal justice system that ’ s turned into one of the world ’ s most punitive .
Capping prison sentences at 20 years — an idea that I first heard from Sentencing Project executive director Marc Mauer — is a really consequential policy change that could affect the lives of up to hundreds of thousands of people .
America ’ s prison population has exploded , from 330,000 in 1980 to 1.5 million in 2016 ( though the figures have started to turn since 2009 ) . That includes at least tens of thousands of people who are likely to spend decades in prison .
In The Meaning of Life : The Case for Abolishing Life Sentences , Mauer and Ashley Nellis wrote that the number of people sentenced to prison for life grew from 34,000 in 1984 to nearly 162,000 in 2016 . The US is a huge outlier , Mauer and Nellis explained : “ A comprehensive 2016 international analysis of life imprisonment found that the number of people serving life imprisonment in the United States is higher than the combined total in the other 113 countries surveyed . ”
The idea for a cap is straightforward : No one could be sentenced for any number of charges — not attempted robbery , rape , or murder — for more than 20 years . There should be a limited exception , like there is in Norway , that lets courts extend prison sentences indefinitely for an additional five years at a time , but only if there ’ s proof that a person still poses a public safety threat .
For a lot of people , this is going to sound ridiculous . Twenty years for murder or rape ? That doesn ’ t seem proportional to the crime .
But this gets us to a deeper conversation about the criminal justice system ’ s purpose . Is it for punishment ? Is it for public safety ? Is it for rehabilitation ? Is it for all of the above , or something else entirely ?
My guess is for those who believe prison should punish offenders , a cap is going to be really hard to swallow . The great , great majority of people who would benefit from this change are violent criminals who have absolutely done bad things . There ’ s no denying that . Americans may want those people to suffer .
But I think those views need to be reconsidered . Even without a cap , the majority of people in prison will be released and reenter society at some point . When we have those people literally captive , why not take the opportunity to try to make sure they can be productive members of society when they return ? Why waste the potential of any human life if we have a chance , small or large , to turn it around ?
And 20 years in prison is still a very long time , so people sentenced at the cap would still suffer . Mauer told me he tries to get people to think about what it ’ d be like to serve such a long sentence .
“ Think back where you were in life 10 years ago , ” he said . “ What ’ s happened to you ? What experiences have you had in 10 years ? You might have gotten married or divorced . You might have had children . You might have had different jobs . You might have had health problems . Think through all the things that go through your life , and that ’ s a small window into what incarceration does . ”
To me , that seems like a terrible punishment — even if I think it ’ s deserved .
Why this can work without hurting public safety : people age out of crime
What about the public safety case against capping prison sentences ? Won ’ t a released murderer , rapist , or robber just go on to victimize more people ?
This concern , while genuine , misunderstands people ’ s propensity to commit crime throughout their lives . Most murderers aren ’ t serial killers , and they aren ’ t very likely , especially decades later , to kill again . The same goes for other crimes .
The evidence is what ’ s known as the age-crime curve . It shows that people tend to age out of crime . In their mid- to late teens and early 20s , people are much , much likelier to commit a crime than they are in their 30s and especially 40s and on .
Here ’ s the age-crime curve for robbery in 2014 , taken from Mauer and Nellis ’ s book :
As the chart makes clear , a person ’ s propensity to commit a crime — in this case , a robbery — is at its highest around 20 years old . But it drops quickly after that . In his 30s , a person ’ s chances of committing a robbery drop to 25 percent of what they were at 20 . In his 40s , the chances drop to less than 12.5 percent . In his 60s , the risk nearly vanishes .
There are exceptions , like lifelong serial killers . But they ’ re few and far between , and could be handled with limited exceptions to a 20-year cap .
Virtually no one in criminology disputes the age-crime curve . Nancy La Vigne , vice president of justice policy at the Urban Institute , told me that it ’ s “ pretty well established in the literature . ”
This shouldn ’ t come as a surprise to most people , particularly those already in their 30s , 40s , or above . Think about how likely you were as a teen to break the law , with underage drinking , using illegal drugs , shoplifting , getting into fights , and so on . Now think about how likely you are to do that today , assuming you ’ re older . Regardless of whether you got caught in your teen years , you are likely an embodiment of the age-crime curve .
John Pfaff , a criminal justice expert at Fordham University and the author of Locked In : The True Causes of Mass Incarceration and How to Achieve Real Reform , told me there are a few reasons for the age-crime curve .
“ Some of it is physical and hormonal : Testosterone levels go up , testosterone levels go down ; violence goes up , violence goes down . Some of it is purely physical : Even if I was as aggressive now as I was 20 years ago , I ’ m 44 — things are slow , things ache a bit more , ” he explained . “ But some of it is also social : Getting married is a pathway out of crime ; finding a career is a pathway out of crime . So the longer we keep people in prison , the longer we tend to undermine the ways these people mature and age out of crime as they get older . ”
Other evidence backs this up . In 2017 , David Roodman of the Open Philanthropy Project conducted an extensive review of the research on longer prison sentences . He concluded that “ tougher sentences hardly deter crime , and that while imprisoning people temporarily stops them from committing crime outside prison walls , it also tends to increase their criminality after release . As a result , ‘ tough-on-crime ’ initiatives can reduce crime in the short run but cause offsetting harm in the long run . ”
There ’ s also evidence that America ’ s mass incarceration experiment has not done much to make the US safer . A 2015 research review by the Brennan Center for Justice estimated that more incarceration — and its abilities to incapacitate or deter criminals — explained about zero to 7 percent of the crime drop since the 1990s , although other researchers estimate it drove 10 to 25 percent of the crime drop since the ’ 90s .
Meanwhile , prisons cost the US a tremendous amount . There ’ s the actual financial cost of putting people in prison , which the Prison Policy Initiative estimated at $ 182 billion in 2017 . There ’ s also the social cost of people being ripped away from their families and communities ; as one example , the New York Times calculated in 2015 that for every 100 black women not in jail or prison , there are only 83 black men — what amounts to 1.5 million “ missing ” men , who can ’ t be there for their kids , family , or community while incarcerated .
In the US , for a 20-year cap to really have an impact , the policy would have to be adopted by the states . Some 87 percent of prisoners in the US are held in state facilities . The change could also be enacted at the federal level , of course , and the feds could try to encourage states to implement such a change with financial incentives ( although similar efforts in the past haven ’ t been very successful ) .
But the majority of those in state prisons are people convicted of violent offenses : In 2015 , 54.5 percent of people in state prisons were in for violent crimes . About 15.2 percent were in for drugs .
Until now , much of the criminal justice reform movement has focused on reducing prison sentences for low-level , nonviolent offenders . A 20-year sentencing cap , however , would almost entirely benefit higher-level , violent offenders — which would be a good thing .
These violent offenders are not all , or even close to mostly , serial killers . They can be people who committed armed robberies but didn ’ t seriously hurt anyone . They can be accomplices of such crimes who never directly hurt anyone at all , such as the getaway driver in a robbery . They can be women who killed their abusers . They can be people who got into fights with friends or family under the influence of alcohol and other drugs but otherwise may not be likely to commit any violent crimes at all .
And violent offenders , overall , make up the majority of the state prison population .
This is why criminal justice activists and scholars , including Pfaff in Locked In , argue that America will have to at some point confront how it treats violent offenders if it really wants to undo mass incarceration .
As it stands , America ’ s incarceration rate is 655 per 100,000 , which is higher than that of authoritarian nations like Cuba ( 510 ) , Russia ( 389 ) , and China ( 118 ) . Democratic , developed nations tend to have even lower incarceration rates than the US ; Canada ’ s is 114 , Germany ’ s is 76 , and Japan ’ s is 41 .
When it comes to life imprisonment in particular , Mauer and Nellis ’ s book pointed to research that suggested the US accounts for 40 percent of the world ’ s total life sentences .
Because the US has higher lethal crime rates ( largely due to easy access to guns ) than other developed nations , there ’ s a good chance that the US will never have incarceration rates as low as other wealthy nations . Still , if the US wants to get back to its own historical trends — like in 1980 , when the number of people in prison was around a fifth of what it is now — it has a lot of room for improvement . But to get that low , at least some violent offenders will have to be let out of prison sooner rather than later .
A cap will force us to think of prison as a place for rehabilitation
A big mental shift we need to make when thinking about prisons is to see them as something more than just for punishment or a public safety mechanism . We need to start entertaining the notion that prison can — should — be a place where we can rehabilitate the incarcerated .
Even today in US prisons , the majority of inmates will be released at some point . This is a fact we do a terrible job recognizing . The US notoriously underfunds rehabilitation and reentry services , contributing to rearrest rates of more than two-thirds within three years of release and more than three-quarters within five years . ( Not all those arrests lead to reincarceration , since they can be for minor infractions . )
But if the US capped all prison sentences at 20 years , it would be forced to recognize a new reality : Just about everyone put in prison will , at one point , be free . And those people will very often need programs to ensure that they can transition back to a normal life .
This has long been the reality for Norway , even before it capped most prison sentences at 21 years ( with a higher cap for terrorism and genocide ) . “ There ’ s no tradition in Norway for keeping people in prison for life , ” Ragnar Kristoffersen , a researcher at the University College of Norwegian Correctional Service who previously worked for the Ministry of Justice , told me .
As a result , Norway has built a prison system that looks very kind by US prison standards . ( If you want to dive deep into this , I recommend reading Jessica Benko ’ s piece in the New York Times Magazine . ) Cells are relatively comfortable . Rehabilitation programs are widely available ; in fact , inmates are required to have at least one activity in the daytime , whether a job , education , or , say , a sex offender program . Guards are trained , with at least a two-year college requirement , to treat inmates with respect and facilitate their rehabilitation .
Norway also has better support once people get out of prison , with a stronger social safety net than the US — one that includes guarantees for health care and education . “ People have something to go to , ” Kristoffersen argued .
For Norway , this gets to a deeper cultural resistance to using prisons purely for punishment . “ What ’ s the reason ? Why do you sentence people ? Why do you punish people ? If it ’ s for revenge , then when is revenge enough ? ” Berit Johnsen , another researcher at the University College of Norwegian Correctional Service , told me .
That ’ s not to say that Norway ’ s prisons are a great place to be . Kristoffersen and Johnsen emphasized that , despite many media reports suggesting otherwise , being in Norway ’ s prisons is still unpleasant . Inmates still lose almost all their freedoms . They ’ re still taken from their friends , family , and communities . As Johnsen put it , “ It is prison . You don ’ t want to go there . ”
It ’ s not clear how much more effective Norway ’ s system is compared to the US ’ s . As Benko noted in the New York Times , the US reincarceration rate — which measures how likely released inmates are to be locked up again — over two years is about 29 percent . That ’ s only a bit higher than Norway ’ s rate of 25 percent . But Norway is still doing better , and its violent crime and homicide rates are much better too — suggesting that the cap , at the very least , doesn ’ t cause more crime even as it limits the harms of incarceration .
This is far from the only solution to mass incarceration , but it ’ s a good model to aim for
If America were to implement a 20-year cap on prison sentences , it would not end mass incarceration . If applied retroactively , it would likely lead to an earlier release for maybe a few hundred thousand inmates , at most , out of the 2.1 million people in jail or prison today .
The cap wouldn ’ t address the sentences for the majority of those 2.1 million people , who are in jail or prison for fewer than 20 years for anything from shoplifting to violent crimes .
A cap also , crucially , wouldn ’ t address jail and prison admissions . While America ’ s incarceration rate has increased over the years in part because people are spending more time in prison , it ’ s also the case that more people are being admitted to jail and prison in general . To tackle that problem , other changes would be needed , such as eliminating some crimes entirely so they don ’ t result in prison time ( by , say , decriminalizing drug possession ) or raising the bar for what kind of crime qualifies for prison time ( like increasing the dollar amount for how much people must steal before they are sent to prison ) .
Setting a cap also wouldn ’ t address other problems in the justice system , from the death penalty to the stigmatization that follows a criminal record to poor conditions in prisons generally . The death penalty in particular may pose serious problems for the cap , since a cap may perversely incentivize courts and juries to send more people to death row if life imprisonment is no longer an option . So the death penalty would need to be repealed if a cap were instituted .
Even with an exception in place to extend prison sentences beyond the 20-year cap , there is a chance , however small , that sometimes courts will misjudge , and a person will be released when he shouldn ’ t have been . But this is also an issue for the current parole system , yet we accept the risk because we think it makes the system more proportional and just . If mass incarceration is a plight we want to get rid of , and that requires releasing some prisoners , we just have to take some of these risks . No solution is flawless .
So I think the cap is a good model to aim for — a daring idea that can really reset how we , as a society , think about prison . It leads to more systemic questions : If a prison sentence for murder is now a maximum of 20 years , can we really justify sending someone to prison for burglary or drugs for 10 or even five years ? If someone is going to be released from prison eventually , shouldn ’ t we ensure that person has support both in and out of prison so he can transition back to society safely ? If prison isn ’ t the end-all , be-all for stopping crime , should we not take other approaches more seriously ?
I don ’ t write any of this lightly . I know there are some uncomfortable questions involved : Do we really want a just-released murderer living next door and working in the same office with us ? Why should we give any sort of break to someone who commits horrific acts ? Does a person who robbed someone else of any chances really deserve a second chance ? All of this is going to be especially hard to confront for victims of crime , who have seen the harms inflicted by the kind of person who would benefit from this policy firsthand .
These are moral , abstract questions that I can ’ t provide a definitive answer to . But based on the evidence and statistics , these are hurdles that we , as a society , have to think about and overcome if we want to rid ourselves of mass incarceration . The reform advocates I spoke to said that a 20-year cap is a promising way to do that — although some of them were very emphatic that some sort of exception allowing longer sentences is necessary . ( Along these lines , some reformers favor a “ second look ” provision that , instead of imposing a cap on sentences , merely requires a sentence reevaluation every 15 or 20 years . )
Now , is any of this politically feasible ? Today , probably not . A ███/Morning Consult survey from 2016 , for one , found very little support for reducing punishments for violent offenders , even if they have a low chance of reoffending .
But in an era when views toward the criminal justice system are shifting , and discussions about everything from adopting a single-payer health care system to free college are growing , a 20-year cap on prison sentences seems like something more progressives could and should embrace .
If nothing else , the evidence strongly indicates that locking people up for longer isn ’ t doing much , if anything , to keep America safer . It ’ s time to try something new .","America puts more people in jail and prison than any other country in the world. Although the country has managed to slightly reduce its prison population in recent years, mass incarceration remains a fact of the US criminal justice system.

It’s time for a radical idea that could really begin to reverse mass incarceration: capping all prison sentences at no more than 20 years. It may sound like an extreme, even dangerous, proposal, but there’s good reason to believe it would help reduce the prison population without making America any less safe.

In the 1980s and ’90s, American officials by and large believed the country was in the middle of a crime wave and an underincarceration crisis; they responded by increasing the length of prison sentences, enacting new mandatory minimums, and restricting the use of parole. Today, with crime rates lower, Americans more readily believe that the country has an overincarceration problem — one that disproportionately afflicts minority communities, as black and brown people are far more likely to be locked up than their white peers.

Given the impact that mass incarceration has had, there’s a strong case that the US should take steps to ensure that it doesn’t ever lock up so many people again.

Looking at the length of our prison sentences is one approach to reverse mass incarceration. Empirical research has consistently found that locking up people for very long periods of time does little to nothing to combat crime, and may actually lead to more crime as people spend more time in prison — missing big life opportunities for legitimate careers, and being incarcerated with others who have ties to the criminal world.

There’s also good reason to believe that 20 years is a good cutoff for a maximum. Studies have found that people almost always age out of crime, particularly by their late 30s and 40s. If a person is locked up for a robbery or murder at 21, there’s a very good chance that he won’t commit that same crime when he gets out at 41.

Other countries show this can work. European nations tend to have shorter prison sentences than the US, and certainly fewer people in prison, along with roughly equal or lower violent crime rates. Norway in particular caps the great majority of prison sentences at 21 years — and its violent crime and reoffending rates are lower than the US’s. (The cap does have some exceptions, as I’ll explain later.)

A cap on prison sentences wouldn’t on its own end mass incarceration. But at least tens of thousands of people in prison would benefit now — if the change were applied retroactively — and untold numbers more would benefit in the future if it were adopted by states and the federal government.

I’m not naive; I know there’s a very, very low chance that this policy will actually be enacted. And I know there are some difficult questions we need to confront if such a policy were ever put in place.

But I think pushing for something like this is a good idea anyway. It forces a conversation about what prisons are for: Are they for keeping the public safe? Rehabilitating inmates? Purely for revenge? If our answer as a society is the first two, but not the latter, then a cap is something we should consider.

By beginning these kinds of conversations, we can try to get at the root cultural and social forces that enabled and encouraged mass incarceration to begin with. Only by doing that can we start to really unravel a criminal justice system that’s turned into one of the world’s most punitive.

How a 20-year sentence cap could work

Capping prison sentences at 20 years — an idea that I first heard from Sentencing Project executive director Marc Mauer — is a really consequential policy change that could affect the lives of up to hundreds of thousands of people.

America’s prison population has exploded, from 330,000 in 1980 to 1.5 million in 2016 (though the figures have started to turn since 2009). That includes at least tens of thousands of people who are likely to spend decades in prison.

In The Meaning of Life: The Case for Abolishing Life Sentences, Mauer and Ashley Nellis wrote that the number of people sentenced to prison for life grew from 34,000 in 1984 to nearly 162,000 in 2016. The US is a huge outlier, Mauer and Nellis explained: “A comprehensive 2016 international analysis of life imprisonment found that the number of people serving life imprisonment in the United States is higher than the combined total in the other 113 countries surveyed.”

The idea for a cap is straightforward: No one could be sentenced for any number of charges — not attempted robbery, rape, or murder — for more than 20 years. There should be a limited exception, like there is in Norway, that lets courts extend prison sentences indefinitely for an additional five years at a time, but only if there’s proof that a person still poses a public safety threat.

For a lot of people, this is going to sound ridiculous. Twenty years for murder or rape? That doesn’t seem proportional to the crime.

But this gets us to a deeper conversation about the criminal justice system’s purpose. Is it for punishment? Is it for public safety? Is it for rehabilitation? Is it for all of the above, or something else entirely?

My guess is for those who believe prison should punish offenders, a cap is going to be really hard to swallow. The great, great majority of people who would benefit from this change are violent criminals who have absolutely done bad things. There’s no denying that. Americans may want those people to suffer.

But I think those views need to be reconsidered. Even without a cap, the majority of people in prison will be released and reenter society at some point. When we have those people literally captive, why not take the opportunity to try to make sure they can be productive members of society when they return? Why waste the potential of any human life if we have a chance, small or large, to turn it around?

And 20 years in prison is still a very long time, so people sentenced at the cap would still suffer. Mauer told me he tries to get people to think about what it’d be like to serve such a long sentence.

“Think back where you were in life 10 years ago,” he said. “What’s happened to you? What experiences have you had in 10 years? You might have gotten married or divorced. You might have had children. You might have had different jobs. You might have had health problems. Think through all the things that go through your life, and that’s a small window into what incarceration does.”

To me, that seems like a terrible punishment — even if I think it’s deserved.

Why this can work without hurting public safety: people age out of crime

What about the public safety case against capping prison sentences? Won’t a released murderer, rapist, or robber just go on to victimize more people?

This concern, while genuine, misunderstands people’s propensity to commit crime throughout their lives. Most murderers aren’t serial killers, and they aren’t very likely, especially decades later, to kill again. The same goes for other crimes.

The evidence is what’s known as the age-crime curve. It shows that people tend to age out of crime. In their mid- to late teens and early 20s, people are much, much likelier to commit a crime than they are in their 30s and especially 40s and on.

Here’s the age-crime curve for robbery in 2014, taken from Mauer and Nellis’s book:

As the chart makes clear, a person’s propensity to commit a crime — in this case, a robbery — is at its highest around 20 years old. But it drops quickly after that. In his 30s, a person’s chances of committing a robbery drop to 25 percent of what they were at 20. In his 40s, the chances drop to less than 12.5 percent. In his 60s, the risk nearly vanishes.

There are exceptions, like lifelong serial killers. But they’re few and far between, and could be handled with limited exceptions to a 20-year cap.

Virtually no one in criminology disputes the age-crime curve. Nancy La Vigne, vice president of justice policy at the Urban Institute, told me that it’s “pretty well established in the literature.”

This shouldn’t come as a surprise to most people, particularly those already in their 30s, 40s, or above. Think about how likely you were as a teen to break the law, with underage drinking, using illegal drugs, shoplifting, getting into fights, and so on. Now think about how likely you are to do that today, assuming you’re older. Regardless of whether you got caught in your teen years, you are likely an embodiment of the age-crime curve.

John Pfaff, a criminal justice expert at Fordham University and the author of Locked In: The True Causes of Mass Incarceration and How to Achieve Real Reform, told me there are a few reasons for the age-crime curve.

“Some of it is physical and hormonal: Testosterone levels go up, testosterone levels go down; violence goes up, violence goes down. Some of it is purely physical: Even if I was as aggressive now as I was 20 years ago, I’m 44 — things are slow, things ache a bit more,” he explained. “But some of it is also social: Getting married is a pathway out of crime; finding a career is a pathway out of crime. So the longer we keep people in prison, the longer we tend to undermine the ways these people mature and age out of crime as they get older.”

Other evidence backs this up. In 2017, David Roodman of the Open Philanthropy Project conducted an extensive review of the research on longer prison sentences. He concluded that “tougher sentences hardly deter crime, and that while imprisoning people temporarily stops them from committing crime outside prison walls, it also tends to increase their criminality after release. As a result, ‘tough-on-crime’ initiatives can reduce crime in the short run but cause offsetting harm in the long run.”

There’s also evidence that America’s mass incarceration experiment has not done much to make the US safer. A 2015 research review by the Brennan Center for Justice estimated that more incarceration — and its abilities to incapacitate or deter criminals — explained about zero to 7 percent of the crime drop since the 1990s, although other researchers estimate it drove 10 to 25 percent of the crime drop since the ’90s.

Meanwhile, prisons cost the US a tremendous amount. There’s the actual financial cost of putting people in prison, which the Prison Policy Initiative estimated at $182 billion in 2017. There’s also the social cost of people being ripped away from their families and communities; as one example, the New York Times calculated in 2015 that for every 100 black women not in jail or prison, there are only 83 black men — what amounts to 1.5 million “missing” men, who can’t be there for their kids, family, or community while incarcerated.

This would lower sentences for violent offenses. That’s good.

In the US, for a 20-year cap to really have an impact, the policy would have to be adopted by the states. Some 87 percent of prisoners in the US are held in state facilities. The change could also be enacted at the federal level, of course, and the feds could try to encourage states to implement such a change with financial incentives (although similar efforts in the past haven’t been very successful).

But the majority of those in state prisons are people convicted of violent offenses: In 2015, 54.5 percent of people in state prisons were in for violent crimes. About 15.2 percent were in for drugs.

Until now, much of the criminal justice reform movement has focused on reducing prison sentences for low-level, nonviolent offenders. A 20-year sentencing cap, however, would almost entirely benefit higher-level, violent offenders — which would be a good thing.

These violent offenders are not all, or even close to mostly, serial killers. They can be people who committed armed robberies but didn’t seriously hurt anyone. They can be accomplices of such crimes who never directly hurt anyone at all, such as the getaway driver in a robbery. They can be women who killed their abusers. They can be people who got into fights with friends or family under the influence of alcohol and other drugs but otherwise may not be likely to commit any violent crimes at all.

And violent offenders, overall, make up the majority of the state prison population.

This is why criminal justice activists and scholars, including Pfaff in Locked In, argue that America will have to at some point confront how it treats violent offenders if it really wants to undo mass incarceration.

As it stands, America’s incarceration rate is 655 per 100,000, which is higher than that of authoritarian nations like Cuba (510), Russia (389), and China (118). Democratic, developed nations tend to have even lower incarceration rates than the US; Canada’s is 114, Germany’s is 76, and Japan’s is 41.

When it comes to life imprisonment in particular, Mauer and Nellis’s book pointed to research that suggested the US accounts for 40 percent of the world’s total life sentences.

Because the US has higher lethal crime rates (largely due to easy access to guns) than other developed nations, there’s a good chance that the US will never have incarceration rates as low as other wealthy nations. Still, if the US wants to get back to its own historical trends — like in 1980, when the number of people in prison was around a fifth of what it is now — it has a lot of room for improvement. But to get that low, at least some violent offenders will have to be let out of prison sooner rather than later.

A cap will force us to think of prison as a place for rehabilitation

A big mental shift we need to make when thinking about prisons is to see them as something more than just for punishment or a public safety mechanism. We need to start entertaining the notion that prison can — should — be a place where we can rehabilitate the incarcerated.

Even today in US prisons, the majority of inmates will be released at some point. This is a fact we do a terrible job recognizing. The US notoriously underfunds rehabilitation and reentry services, contributing to rearrest rates of more than two-thirds within three years of release and more than three-quarters within five years. (Not all those arrests lead to reincarceration, since they can be for minor infractions.)

But if the US capped all prison sentences at 20 years, it would be forced to recognize a new reality: Just about everyone put in prison will, at one point, be free. And those people will very often need programs to ensure that they can transition back to a normal life.

This has long been the reality for Norway, even before it capped most prison sentences at 21 years (with a higher cap for terrorism and genocide). “There’s no tradition in Norway for keeping people in prison for life,” Ragnar Kristoffersen, a researcher at the University College of Norwegian Correctional Service who previously worked for the Ministry of Justice, told me.

As a result, Norway has built a prison system that looks very kind by US prison standards. (If you want to dive deep into this, I recommend reading Jessica Benko’s piece in the New York Times Magazine.) Cells are relatively comfortable. Rehabilitation programs are widely available; in fact, inmates are required to have at least one activity in the daytime, whether a job, education, or, say, a sex offender program. Guards are trained, with at least a two-year college requirement, to treat inmates with respect and facilitate their rehabilitation.

Norway also has better support once people get out of prison, with a stronger social safety net than the US — one that includes guarantees for health care and education. “People have something to go to,” Kristoffersen argued.

For Norway, this gets to a deeper cultural resistance to using prisons purely for punishment. “What’s the reason? Why do you sentence people? Why do you punish people? If it’s for revenge, then when is revenge enough?” Berit Johnsen, another researcher at the University College of Norwegian Correctional Service, told me.

That’s not to say that Norway’s prisons are a great place to be. Kristoffersen and Johnsen emphasized that, despite many media reports suggesting otherwise, being in Norway’s prisons is still unpleasant. Inmates still lose almost all their freedoms. They’re still taken from their friends, family, and communities. As Johnsen put it, “It is prison. You don’t want to go there.”

It’s not clear how much more effective Norway’s system is compared to the US’s. As Benko noted in the New York Times, the US reincarceration rate — which measures how likely released inmates are to be locked up again — over two years is about 29 percent. That’s only a bit higher than Norway’s rate of 25 percent. But Norway is still doing better, and its violent crime and homicide rates are much better too — suggesting that the cap, at the very least, doesn’t cause more crime even as it limits the harms of incarceration.

This is far from the only solution to mass incarceration, but it’s a good model to aim for

If America were to implement a 20-year cap on prison sentences, it would not end mass incarceration. If applied retroactively, it would likely lead to an earlier release for maybe a few hundred thousand inmates, at most, out of the 2.1 million people in jail or prison today.

The cap wouldn’t address the sentences for the majority of those 2.1 million people, who are in jail or prison for fewer than 20 years for anything from shoplifting to violent crimes.

A cap also, crucially, wouldn’t address jail and prison admissions. While America’s incarceration rate has increased over the years in part because people are spending more time in prison, it’s also the case that more people are being admitted to jail and prison in general. To tackle that problem, other changes would be needed, such as eliminating some crimes entirely so they don’t result in prison time (by, say, decriminalizing drug possession) or raising the bar for what kind of crime qualifies for prison time (like increasing the dollar amount for how much people must steal before they are sent to prison).

Setting a cap also wouldn’t address other problems in the justice system, from the death penalty to the stigmatization that follows a criminal record to poor conditions in prisons generally. The death penalty in particular may pose serious problems for the cap, since a cap may perversely incentivize courts and juries to send more people to death row if life imprisonment is no longer an option. So the death penalty would need to be repealed if a cap were instituted.

Even with an exception in place to extend prison sentences beyond the 20-year cap, there is a chance, however small, that sometimes courts will misjudge, and a person will be released when he shouldn’t have been. But this is also an issue for the current parole system, yet we accept the risk because we think it makes the system more proportional and just. If mass incarceration is a plight we want to get rid of, and that requires releasing some prisoners, we just have to take some of these risks. No solution is flawless.

So I think the cap is a good model to aim for — a daring idea that can really reset how we, as a society, think about prison. It leads to more systemic questions: If a prison sentence for murder is now a maximum of 20 years, can we really justify sending someone to prison for burglary or drugs for 10 or even five years? If someone is going to be released from prison eventually, shouldn’t we ensure that person has support both in and out of prison so he can transition back to society safely? If prison isn’t the end-all, be-all for stopping crime, should we not take other approaches more seriously?

I don’t write any of this lightly. I know there are some uncomfortable questions involved: Do we really want a just-released murderer living next door and working in the same office with us? Why should we give any sort of break to someone who commits horrific acts? Does a person who robbed someone else of any chances really deserve a second chance? All of this is going to be especially hard to confront for victims of crime, who have seen the harms inflicted by the kind of person who would benefit from this policy firsthand.

These are moral, abstract questions that I can’t provide a definitive answer to. But based on the evidence and statistics, these are hurdles that we, as a society, have to think about and overcome if we want to rid ourselves of mass incarceration. The reform advocates I spoke to said that a 20-year cap is a promising way to do that — although some of them were very emphatic that some sort of exception allowing longer sentences is necessary. (Along these lines, some reformers favor a “second look” provision that, instead of imposing a cap on sentences, merely requires a sentence reevaluation every 15 or 20 years.)

Now, is any of this politically feasible? Today, probably not. A Vox/Morning Consult survey from 2016, for one, found very little support for reducing punishments for violent offenders, even if they have a low chance of reoffending.

But in an era when views toward the criminal justice system are shifting, and discussions about everything from adopting a single-payer health care system to free college are growing, a 20-year cap on prison sentences seems like something more progressives could and should embrace.

If nothing else, the evidence strongly indicates that locking people up for longer isn’t doing much, if anything, to keep America safer. It’s time to try something new.

Attorney general Jeff Sessions is directing federal prosecutors to pursue the most serious charges possible against the vast majority of suspects , a reversal of Obama-era policies that is sure to send more people to prison and for much longer terms .
Woman who laughed at Jeff Sessions hearing convicted for being 'disorderly ' Read more
The move has long been expected from Sessions , a former federal prosecutor who cut his teeth at the height of the crack cocaine epidemic and who has promised to make combating violence and drugs the justice department ’ s top priority .
“ This policy affirms our responsibility to enforce the law , is moral and just , and produces consistency , ” Sessions wrote in a memo sent Thursday night to US attorneys and made public early on Friday .
The move amounts to an unmistakable undoing of Obama administration criminal justice policies that aimed to ease overcrowding in federal prisons and contributed to a national rethinking of how drug criminals were prosecuted and sentenced . Critics said the change will subject more lower-level offenders to unfairly harsh mandatory minimum sentences .
Sessions contends a spike in violence in some big cities and the nation ’ s opioid epidemic show the need for a return to tougher tactics .
“ The opioid and heroin epidemic is a contributor to the recent surge of violent crime in America , ” Sessions said in remarks prepared for a Thursday speech in Charleston , West Virginia . “ Drug trafficking is an inherently violent business . If you want to collect a drug debt , you can ’ t , and don ’ t , file a lawsuit in court . You collect it by the barrel of a gun . ”
The policy memo says prosecutors should “ charge and pursue the most serious , readily provable offense ” – something more likely to trigger mandatory minimum sentences . Those rules limit a judge ’ s discretion and are typically dictated , for example , by the quantity of drugs involved in a crime .
The memo concedes there will be cases in which “ good judgment ” will warrant a prosecutor to veer from that rule . But any exceptions will need to be approved by top supervisors , and the reasons must be documented , allowing the justice department to track the handling of such cases by its 94 US attorney ’ s offices .
Even if they opt not to pursue the most serious charges , prosecutors are still required to provide judges with all the details of a case when defendants are sentenced , which could lengthen prison terms .
The requirements “ place great confidence in our prosecutors and supervisors to apply them in a thoughtful and disciplined manner , with the goal of achieving just and consistent results in federal cases ” , the memo states .
The directive rescinds guidance by Sessions ’ Democratic predecessor , Eric Holder , who told prosecutors they could in some cases leave drug quantities out of charging documents so as not to trigger long sentences . Holder ’ s 2013 initiative , known as Smart on Crime , was aimed at encouraging shorter sentences for nonviolent drug offenders and preserving justice department resources for more serious and violent criminals .

Attorney general Jeff Sessions is directing federal prosecutors to pursue the most serious charges possible against the vast majority of suspects, a reversal of Obama-era policies that is sure to send more people to prison and for much longer terms.

The move has long been expected from Sessions, a former federal prosecutor who cut his teeth at the height of the crack cocaine epidemic and who has promised to make combating violence and drugs the justice department’s top priority.

“This policy affirms our responsibility to enforce the law, is moral and just, and produces consistency,” Sessions wrote in a memo sent Thursday night to US attorneys and made public early on Friday.

The move amounts to an unmistakable undoing of Obama administration criminal justice policies that aimed to ease overcrowding in federal prisons and contributed to a national rethinking of how drug criminals were prosecuted and sentenced. Critics said the change will subject more lower-level offenders to unfairly harsh mandatory minimum sentences.

Sessions contends a spike in violence in some big cities and the nation’s opioid epidemic show the need for a return to tougher tactics.

“The opioid and heroin epidemic is a contributor to the recent surge of violent crime in America,” Sessions said in remarks prepared for a Thursday speech in Charleston, West Virginia. “Drug trafficking is an inherently violent business. If you want to collect a drug debt, you can’t, and don’t, file a lawsuit in court. You collect it by the barrel of a gun.”

The policy memo says prosecutors should “charge and pursue the most serious, readily provable offense” – something more likely to trigger mandatory minimum sentences. Those rules limit a judge’s discretion and are typically dictated, for example, by the quantity of drugs involved in a crime.

The memo concedes there will be cases in which “good judgment” will warrant a prosecutor to veer from that rule. But any exceptions will need to be approved by top supervisors, and the reasons must be documented, allowing the justice department to track the handling of such cases by its 94 US attorney’s offices.

Even if they opt not to pursue the most serious charges, prosecutors are still required to provide judges with all the details of a case when defendants are sentenced, which could lengthen prison terms.

The requirements “place great confidence in our prosecutors and supervisors to apply them in a thoughtful and disciplined manner, with the goal of achieving just and consistent results in federal cases”, the memo states.

The directive rescinds guidance by Sessions’ Democratic predecessor, Eric Holder, who told prosecutors they could in some cases leave drug quantities out of charging documents so as not to trigger long sentences. Holder’s 2013 initiative, known as Smart on Crime, was aimed at encouraging shorter sentences for nonviolent drug offenders and preserving justice department resources for more serious and violent criminals.

Though Holder did say that prosecutors ordinarily should charge the most serious offense, he instructed them to do an “individualized assessment” of the defendant’s conduct. And he outlined exceptions for not pursuing mandatory minimum sentences, including if a defendant’s crime does not involve violence or if the person doesn’t have a leadership role in a criminal organization.

The Obama policy shift coincided with US Sentencing Commission changes that made tens of thousands of federal drug prisoners eligible for early release, and an Obama administration clemency initiative that freed convicts deemed deserving of a second chance.

Combined, those changes led to a steep decline in a federal prison population that now stands at just under 190,000, down from nearly 220,000 in 2013. Nearly half of those inmates are in custody for drug crimes, records show.

The attacks against judicial nominee Steven Menashi picked up last week with a segment by MSNBC ’ s Rachel Maddow , in which the host discussed a 2010 article Menashi wrote for the University of Pennsylvania Journal of International Law , titled “ Ethnonationalism and Liberal Democracy . ”

Maddow started off her discussion by comparing the term “ ethnonationalism ” to white nationalism .

Menashi ’ s article does not say anything about democracy requiring that people be of the same race . What the article is about – and what Maddow does not mention – is the reconciliation of liberal democratic ideals with the concept of Israel as a Jewish state . Menashi , who is Jewish and of Iraqi descent , argues that Israel being a Jewish state is no different than other countries establishing a state for citizens of a common origin . While Israel does grant preference to Jews when it comes to granting citizenship , he argues once people are citizens of Israel , they enjoy equal rights regardless of religion or country of origin .
Still , Maddow described Menashi as “ the academic drum major for ethnonationalism ” and being on the “ fringe of racial thinking . ”
Carrie Severino , chief counsel and policy director of the conservative Judicial Crisis Network , accused Maddow of portraying Mensahi ’ s article as “ the exact opposite ” of what he was saying , wondering whether it was “ intentional distortion . ”
The Republican Jewish Coalition called Maddow ’ s report “ both ignorant & defamatory , ” saying she accused “ an Iraqi Jew of racism because she can ’ t comprehend the highly qualified social science evidence cited in his law review article published by @ Penn . ”
Maddow also claimed that Menashi once repeated a false story that General John Pershing used “ bullets dipped in pig fat ” to kill Muslim terrorists . Maddow claimed that Menashi wrote about that story “ in the course of his academic career ” -- but lawyer Ed Whelan wrote in the National Review that not only was this taken out of context , but it was not during his academic career . Rather , Menashi discussed it in a book review prior to starting law school and after completing college , not when he was a law professor . Whelan also noted that Menashi did not endorse the methods described in the story .
“ Nowhere in his book review does Menashi argue in favor of such anti-terrorism tactics , ” Whelan wrote . “ On the contrary , he faults the author whose book he is reviewing for promoting a view of American power that 'would divorce itself from a special concern for human rights ' and for amorally 'sanction [ ing ] brutal tactics for maintaining order .

CNN also discussed Menashi ’ s past writing , with an Aug. 22 article delving into his college work . The network said Menashi “ has a history of denouncing women 's marches against sexual assault , dismissing education about multicultural awareness and accusing a major LGBTQ group of exploiting the brutal murder of a gay student for political ends . ”
Menashi ’ s college article that discussed the women ’ s “ Take Back the Night ” march did not defend sexual assault ; rather , it cited the march as an example of instances on the Dartmouth campus that he said employ negative generalizations of men . In discussing how a magazine included Dartmouth among the “ ten most antimale schools , ” Menashi claimed that the marches “ charge the majority of male students with complicity in rape and sexual violence . ”

Menashi was indeed accusatory in saying that the Human Rights Campaign was “ valuing lives instrumentally , according to political calculations. ” Menashi claimed that while the group had no problem using the Shepard case to promote their interests , they tried to stay away from discussing the Dirkhising case . He accused the media of doing the same thing .
He claimed that left-leaning outlets covered the Shephard murder because it aided the cause of gay rights , but feared that coverage of the Dirkhising case would promote negative views of gay people , which Menashi said would have no grounds in reality .

U.S. District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson said Trump had “ exceeded his authority ” in issuing the orders .
The White House had no comment and referred questions to the Justice Department , which said it was reviewing the judge ’ s ruling and considering options . Federal worker unions that had sued to block Trump ’ s use of his executive authority in this area applauded the outcome .
“ President Trump ’ s illegal action was a direct assault on the legal rights and protections that Congress specifically guaranteed to the public-sector employees across this country who keep our federal government running every single day , ” said J. David Cox Sr. , national president of the American Federation of Government Employees , the largest of the federal worker unions .

U.S. District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson said Trump had “exceeded his authority” in issuing the orders.

The White House had no comment and referred questions to the Justice Department, which said it was reviewing the judge’s ruling and considering options. Federal worker unions that had sued to block Trump’s use of his executive authority in this area applauded the outcome.

“President Trump’s illegal action was a direct assault on the legal rights and protections that Congress specifically guaranteed to the public-sector employees across this country who keep our federal government running every single day,” said J. David Cox Sr., national president of the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest of the federal worker unions.

Cox’s organization, which represents about 700,000 of the approximately 2 million-member federal workforce, was first to challenge the executive orders, filing two lawsuits.

The executive orders, issued by the White House in May, covered collective bargaining rights, grievance procedures and use of “official time.”

Lobbying and pursuing grievances on taxpayer-funded union time were to be curtailed, and the orders also aimed to streamline the amount of time needed to terminate a federal worker for poor performance or misconduct.

The unions argued that the executive orders were illegal because federal law requires the government and federal employee unions to negotiate over such changes.

Jackson agreed, ruling that Trump had overstepped his authority. “This Court finds that these provisions conflict with congressional intent in a manner that cannot be sustained,” the President Barack Obama appointee wrote in a 122-page opinion. It was unclear Saturday whether the administration planned to appeal.

“In this Court’s view, these directives undermine federal employees’ right to bargain collectively as protected by” federal law, “and as a result, the President must be deemed to have exceeded his authority in issuing them,” the judge wrote.

Tony Reardon, national president of the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents 150,000 federal government employees, said Congress meant for unions and agencies to bargain over the use of official time and grievance procedures.

“The judge rightly found that the president is not above the law and cannot, through these blatantly anti-union and anti-worker executive orders, eviscerate employee rights and undermine the collective bargaining process established by Congress,” Reardon said.

According to a recent report published in Legal Times , the Trump administration is moving quickly to fill those vacancies and is now considering a shortlist of six candidates for the two jobs . What names are on the list ? Here 's Legal Times :
According to four people who are familiar with the process but who declined to be named , the candidates being considered include : Texas Supreme Court Justice Don Willett ; U.S. District Court Judge Reed O'Connor of Fort Worth ; former Texas solicitor general James Ho ; Andy Oldham , a deputy general counsel to Gov . Greg Abbott ; Michael Massengale , a justice on Houston 's First Court of Appeals , and Brett Busby , a justice on Houston 's Fourteenth Court of Appeals .
Two names on this list jump right out at me .
The first is Texas Supreme Court Justice Don Willett , a rising star in conservative and libertarian legal circles who also appeared on Trump 's recent list of potential U.S. Supreme Court nominees .
Willett is best-known for his concurring opinion in the 2015 case of Patel v. Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation . At issue was whether state officials had a legitimate health or safety ███ to require eyebrow threaders to obtain an occupational license before they could lawfully charge customers for the act of threading a piece of cotton string through their eyebrows in order to remove old hair and skin . The Texas Supreme Court laughed away the state 's ostensible justifications and struck down the regulation .
Willett joined the majority opinion but also wrote separately in order to emphasize the broader issues at stake . His 49-page concurrence is effectively a call to judicial arms in defense of economic liberty . `` This case is fundamentally about the American Dream and the unalienable human right to pursue happiness without curtsying to government on bended knee , '' he wrote . `` It is about whether government can connive with rent-seeking factions to ration liberty unrestrained , and whether judges must submissively uphold even the most risible encroachments . '' I should also note that Willett 's Patel opinion favorably cited my book Overruled : The Long War for Control of the U.S. Supreme Court .
If successfully appointed to the 5th Circuit , Willett would immediately rank as one of the most libertarian-minded federal judges in the country .
The second name on the 5th Circuit shortlist that jumps out at me is former Texas solicitor general James Ho . A former clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas , Ho is perhaps best known in legal circles for a 2006 law review article defending the constitutionality of birthright citizenship for the U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrant parents . `` Birthright citizenship is guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment , '' Ho wrote . `` That birthright is protected no less for children of undocumented persons than for descendants of Mayflower passengers . ''
Notably , Ho 's position here is directly at odds with the stated views of Donald Trump . In an August 2015 immigration white paper , for example , presidential candidate Trump vowed to `` end birthright citizenship , '' calling it the `` biggest magnet for illegal immigration . '' In an interview with Fox News host Bill O'Reilly , Trump said , `` I do n't think they have American citizenship , '' referring to the U.S.-born children of undocumented parents . `` It 's not going to hold up in court , it 's going to have to be tested . ''
Here 's an amusing thought experiment : Trump tries to test his theory of birthright citizenship in the 5th Circuit and ends up in the courtroom of Trump-appointee Judge James Ho .

justice,Reason,2,https://reason.com/2020/06/21/was-the-search-warrant-for-the-drug-raid-that-killed-breonna-taylor-illegal/,Was the Search Warrant for the Drug Raid That Killed Breonna Taylor Illegal?,2020-06-21,"Jacob Sullum, Elizabeth Nolan Brown, Ward Farnsworth, Josh Blackman, Shikha Dalmia, Charles Oliver, Scott Shackford, David Post, Lenore Skenazy, Nick Gillespie","When Louisville , Kentucky , Detective Joshua Jaynes applied for the no-knock search warrant that led to Breonna Taylor 's death last March , he said he expected to find `` illegal narcotics or paraphernalia , '' `` proceeds from drug trafficking , '' or `` paperwork that may be a record of narcotics sales or that may indicate the transport , concealment or sales of narcotics . '' But after three plainclothes officers broke into Taylor 's apartment around 12:40 a.m. on March 13 and shot the unarmed 26-year-old woman dead , they did not find any of that . Why did they think they would ?
That question goes to the heart of the legal justification for the raid , during which Tayor 's boyfriend fired a shot at the cops , whom he mistook for armed robbers , hitting one of them in the leg . According to a wrongful-death lawsuit filed by Taylor 's family , the officers responded by `` spray [ ing ] gunfire into the residence with a total disregard for the value of human life . '' Taylor 's relatives say police fired more than 20 rounds , at least eight of which struck Taylor , an African-American EMT and aspiring nurse with no criminal record . Two days ago , Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said the city will try to fire Detective Brett Hankison , who is accused of `` blindly '' shooting 10 rounds into Taylor 's apartment .
The tactics the cops used during the raid have generated justified outrage locally and nationwide . But the case , which has been frequently cited in the protests against police brutality triggered by George Floyd 's death , also highlights the problem of inadequate judicial oversight , which allows operations like this one to proceed based on meager evidence .
When he applied for a warrant to search Taylor 's apartment , Jaynes also asked for four other warrants : one for a suspected `` trap house '' allegedly operated by Jamarcus Glover and Adrian Walker ( no relation to Kenneth Walker ) at 2424 Elliott Avenue , two for vacant homes near that address , and one for a suspected stash house on West Muhammad Ali Boulevard . USA Today notes that Jefferson County Circuit Judge Mary Shaw approved all five warrants `` within 12 minutes . ''
In his affidavit , Jaynes described substantial evidence that Glover and Adrian Walker were selling drugs . He noted pending drug charges against both men ; his observation of `` 15-20 vehicles '' going to and from the house at 2424 Elliott Avenue `` within a short period of time '' ; surveillance camera footage showing Glover dropping and concealing `` a large , blue cylinder-shaped object '' next to rocks near that address ; video of both suspects going back and forth between the stash and the house ; a December 30 search that found `` narcotics and firearms '' in the house ; and a January 2 traffic stop for speeding that discovered `` a small amount of marijuana '' and `` a large undetermined amount of US currency located in the center console '' of a red 2017 Dodge Charger driven by Adrian Walker .
By contrast , the evidence implicating Taylor , and thereby justifying searches of her apartment and her white 2016 Chevrolet Impala , was slight . Jaynes said he had seen Glover 's Dodge Charger `` make frequent trips '' between the Elliott Avenue house and Taylor 's apartment complex on Springfield Drive , which is about 10 miles away . He also reported that he had observed Taylor 's car parked in front of the Elliott Avenue house `` on different occasions . '' On January 16 , Jaynes said , he had seen Glover pick up `` a suspected USPS package '' at Taylor 's apartment . Jaynes also claimed he had `` verified through a US Postal Inspector '' that Glover was `` receiving packages '' there .
Taylor had dated Glover , and they remained friendly , which would explain the contacts that Jaynes observed . In a May 15 interview with WDRB , the local Fox TV station , Tony Gooden , a U.S. postal inspector in Louisville , said city police had never consulted with his office about the packages Glover received at Taylor 's apartment . Gooden added that a different law enforcement agency , which he declined to identify , had asked about the packages in January , when his office concluded `` there 's no packages of interest going there . '' My former ███ colleague Radley Balko , writing at The Washington Post , reports that `` a source with knowledge of the case has since told me that the packages contained clothes and shoes . ''
Based on Jaynes ' affidavit , Judge Shaw had no way of knowing about the relationship between Taylor and Glover , the contents of the packages , or the conclusion by the postal inspector 's office that there was nothing suspicious about them . But if she had spent more time reviewing Jaynes ' warrant applications , she might have thought to ask whether there could be an innocent explanation for the interactions between Taylor and Glover , which apparently had nothing to do with drugs . Although Jaynes presented compelling evidence of drug dealing by Glover , who was arrested along with Adrian Walker the same night that police killed Taylor , the detective 's inferences about her were based purely on guilt by association .
`` There was clearly no probable cause to believe drugs were being dealt from her apartment , and no probable cause that Breonna or her boyfriend were doing anything illegal , '' says Daniel Klein , a former Albuquerque police sergeant who writes about law enforcement issues , in an email . `` Yet the assistant district attorney and the [ circuit ] court judge not only approved the warrant…they approved it to be a no-knock warrant executed in the middle of the night ! ''
Balko argues that the no-knock warrant was illegal because Jaynes did not cite any information specific to Taylor that would justify dispensing with the usual knock-and-announce requirement . Instead Jaynes offered boilerplate that is commonly seen in applications for no-knock warrants : `` Affiant is requesting a No-Knock entry to the premises due to the nature of how these drug traffickers operate . These drug traffickers have a history of attempting to destroy evidence , have cameras on the location that compromise Detectives once an approach to the dwelling is made , and a have history of fleeing from law enforcement . '' Yet none of that was true of Taylor—another crucial point that a more diligent judge might have noticed .
Despite the no-knock warrant , the officers who raided Taylor 's apartment say they did announce themselves—a claim that Kenneth Walker and 16 neighbors disputed . But even if the cops did identify themselves while banging on Taylor 's door for 30 to 45 seconds ( according to Walker ) before breaking it in with a battering ram , that information could easily have been missed by people awakened in the middle of the night . The evidence indicates that Walker—who reported a break-in during phone calls to police , his mother , and Taylor 's mother—did not realize the armed men invading the apartment were police officers . Walker was initially charged with the attempted murder of a police officer , but prosecutors dropped that charge last month .
This month the Louisville City Council unanimously approved an ordinance that bans no-knock raids . As Balko notes , however , there is often little practical difference between no-knock raids and knock-and-announce raids , especially when warrants are served while residents are sleeping and police breach the door as they identify themselves or immediately afterward . Still , there is a legal distinction between the two kinds of searches , and the Supreme Court has said no-knock entries require something more than general observations about how certain kinds of suspects have been known to behave , although it also has said violations of that rule do not invalidate the evidence police collect .
`` When I was a detective , the D.A . and judges would actually read the warrant , '' says Klein , who handled many drug investigations during his 20 years with the Albuquerque Police Department . `` They took it seriously . There were several times I was told to go back and get more probable cause . That was the right thing to do . Having a D.A . and judge sign/approve a warrant is a check and balance for our system . ''
The FBI is investigating the raid that killed Taylor . According to the lawsuit by Taylor 's family , Hankison , the officer Fischer wants to fire , has a `` use of force history '' that is `` pages long , documenting dozens of situations where he has sent citizens to the hospital for injuries from being tased , pepper sprayed and struck repeatedly in the nose and eyes .

WASHINGTON ( AP ) — Roger Stone , a longtime friend and ally of President Donald Trump , was found guilty Friday of witness tampering and lying to Congress about his pursuit of Russian-hacked emails damaging to Hillary Clinton ’ s 2016 election bid .
Stone was convicted of all seven counts in a federal indictment that accused him of lying to Congress , tampering with a witness and obstructing the House investigation into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia to tip the 2016 election . He is the sixth Trump aide or adviser to be convicted of charges brought as part of special counsel Robert Mueller ’ s Russia investigation .
Stone has denied wrongdoing and consistently criticized the case against him as politically motivated . He did not take the stand during the trial and his lawyers did not call any witnesses in his defense .
Stone , 67 , showed no visible reaction as the verdict was read aloud , count by count . He ’ s scheduled to be sentenced on Feb. 6 . He could face up to 20 years . Another former Trump campaign aide , Michael Caputo , was removed by the courtroom by security officers after he turned his back on the jury after the verdict was read .
Stone smirked at reporters as he left the courtroom , holding hands with his wife . As he walked out of the courthouse , Stone was asked if he had any comment on the verdict and replied : “ none whatsoever ” before he hopped into a waiting SUV with his wife .
Trump tweeted minutes after the verdict , calling the conviction “ a double standard like never seen before in the history of our Country , ” because his frequent nemeses , including Hillary Clinton , former FBI Director James Comey and “ including even Mueller himself , ” have not been convicted . “ Didn ’ t they lie ? ”
In a trial that lasted about a week , witnesses highlighted how Trump campaign associates were eager to gather information about emails the U.S. says were hacked by Russia and then provided to the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks .
Steve Bannon , who served as the campaign ’ s chief executive , testified during the trial the trial that Stone had boasted about his ties to WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange , alerting them to pending new batches of damaging emails . Campaign officials saw Stone as the “ access point ” to WikiLeaks , he said .
After the verdict was read , prosecutors asked for Stone to be jailed as he awaits sentencing , arguing that he may have violated a judge ’ s order that prohibits him from communicating with the media about his case . But Judge Amy Berman Jackson rejected that request and said Stone will be subject to same conditions he faced following his arrest , including the gag order .
Throughout the trial , prosecutors used Stone ’ s own text messages and emails — some of which appeared to contradict his congressional testimony — to lay out their case that he lied to Congress and threatened a witness . Stone did not testify , and his lawyers called no witnesses in his defense .
On Tuesday , a top Trump campaign official , Rick Gates , who was a key cooperator in the Mueller probe , testified that that Stone tried to contact Jared Kushner , Trump ’ s son-in-law , to “ debrief ” him about developments on the hacked emails .
Prosecutors alleged Stone lied to Congress about his conversations about WikiLeaks with New York radio host and comedian Randy Credico — who scored an interview with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in 2016 , when he was avoiding prosecution by sheltering in the Ecuadoran embassy in London — and conservative writer and conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi .
During the 2016 campaign , Stone had mentioned in interviews and public appearances that he was in contact with Assange through a trusted intermediary and hinted at inside knowledge of WikiLeaks ’ plans . But he started pressing Credico to broker a contact , and Credico testified that he told Stone to work through his own intermediary .
Earlier testimony revealed that Stone , while appearing before the House Intelligence Committee , named Credico as his intermediary to Assange and pressured Credico not to contradict him .
After Credico was contacted by Congress , he reached out to Stone , who told him he should “ stonewall it ” and “ plead the fifth , ” he testified . Credico also testified during Stone ’ s trial that Stone repeatedly told him to “ do a ‘ Frank Pentangeli , ’ ” a reference to a character in “ The Godfather : Part II ” who lies before Congress .
Prosecutors said Stone also had threatened Credico ’ s therapy dog , Bianca , saying he was “ going to take that dog away from you . ”

WASHINGTON (AP) — Roger Stone, a longtime friend and ally of President Donald Trump, was found guilty Friday of witness tampering and lying to Congress about his pursuit of Russian-hacked emails damaging to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 election bid.

Stone was convicted of all seven counts in a federal indictment that accused him of lying to Congress, tampering with a witness and obstructing the House investigation into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia to tip the 2016 election. He is the sixth Trump aide or adviser to be convicted of charges brought as part of special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation.

Stone has denied wrongdoing and consistently criticized the case against him as politically motivated. He did not take the stand during the trial and his lawyers did not call any witnesses in his defense.

Stone, 67, showed no visible reaction as the verdict was read aloud, count by count. He’s scheduled to be sentenced on Feb. 6. He could face up to 20 years. Another former Trump campaign aide, Michael Caputo, was removed by the courtroom by security officers after he turned his back on the jury after the verdict was read.

Stone smirked at reporters as he left the courtroom, holding hands with his wife. As he walked out of the courthouse, Stone was asked if he had any comment on the verdict and replied: “none whatsoever” before he hopped into a waiting SUV with his wife.

Trump tweeted minutes after the verdict, calling the conviction “a double standard like never seen before in the history of our Country,” because his frequent nemeses, including Hillary Clinton, former FBI Director James Comey and “including even Mueller himself,” have not been convicted. “Didn’t they lie?”

In a trial that lasted about a week, witnesses highlighted how Trump campaign associates were eager to gather information about emails the U.S. says were hacked by Russia and then provided to the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks.

Steve Bannon, who served as the campaign’s chief executive, testified during the trial the trial that Stone had boasted about his ties to WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange, alerting them to pending new batches of damaging emails. Campaign officials saw Stone as the “access point” to WikiLeaks, he said.

After the verdict was read, prosecutors asked for Stone to be jailed as he awaits sentencing, arguing that he may have violated a judge’s order that prohibits him from communicating with the media about his case. But Judge Amy Berman Jackson rejected that request and said Stone will be subject to same conditions he faced following his arrest, including the gag order.

Throughout the trial, prosecutors used Stone’s own text messages and emails — some of which appeared to contradict his congressional testimony — to lay out their case that he lied to Congress and threatened a witness. Stone did not testify, and his lawyers called no witnesses in his defense.

On Tuesday, a top Trump campaign official, Rick Gates, who was a key cooperator in the Mueller probe, testified that that Stone tried to contact Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, to “debrief” him about developments on the hacked emails.

Prosecutors alleged Stone lied to Congress about his conversations about WikiLeaks with New York radio host and comedian Randy Credico — who scored an interview with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in 2016, when he was avoiding prosecution by sheltering in the Ecuadoran embassy in London — and conservative writer and conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi.

During the 2016 campaign, Stone had mentioned in interviews and public appearances that he was in contact with Assange through a trusted intermediary and hinted at inside knowledge of WikiLeaks’ plans. But he started pressing Credico to broker a contact, and Credico testified that he told Stone to work through his own intermediary.

Earlier testimony revealed that Stone, while appearing before the House Intelligence Committee, named Credico as his intermediary to Assange and pressured Credico not to contradict him.

After Credico was contacted by Congress, he reached out to Stone, who told him he should “stonewall it” and “plead the fifth,” he testified. Credico also testified during Stone’s trial that Stone repeatedly told him to “do a ‘Frank Pentangeli,’” a reference to a character in “The Godfather: Part II” who lies before Congress.

Prosecutors said Stone also had threatened Credico’s therapy dog, Bianca, saying he was “going to take that dog away from you.”

On Wednesday , Lawrence VanDyke , Donald Trump ’ s nominee for a seat on the 9th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals , made news by crying at his confirmation hearing . He began weeping after he was confronted with a letter from the American Bar Association that had deemed him “ Not Qualified , ” a ranking based on 60 interviews with 43 lawyers , 16 judges , and one other person who had worked with him . In their dealings with VanDyke , these individuals found him to be “ arrogant , lazy , an ideologue , and lacking in knowledge of the day-to-day practice including procedural rules. ” When Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley asked him , sympathetically , about the ABA concerns over whether “ VanDyke would be fair to persons who are gay , lesbian , or otherwise part of the LGBTQ community , ” the nominee sobbed openly . Despite his years of anti-LGBTQ writings and advocacy , VanDyke was the one who felt persecuted . Did he believe , Hawley asked , that he would treat LGBTQ litigants unfairly ? “ I do not believe that , ” VanDyke said . “ It is a fundamental belief of mine that all people are created in the image of God , ” he insisted . “ They should all be treated with dignity and respect . ”
What , exactly , does VanDyke have to cry about ? That someone hurt his feelings ? That after a career spent maligning and excluding gay Americans from everyday civic life , he feels entitled to glide onto an Article III court without answering for any of it ? For his entire career , he has been the one defending invidious discrimination , not suffering it . But upon being asked to answer for his anti-gay work , VanDyke did what many anti-LGBTQ advocates do today : He played the victim . He literally cried . He talked about God . And he centered his own pain . Imagine the indignity of having to answer for your years of tireless toil in opposition to marriage equality , civil rights protections for LGBTQ Americans , and the rights of gay students to join school clubs ! How awful .
Along with the crying , VanDyke tried to explain that his views have changed since he penned a 2004 op-ed at Harvard Law School insisting that same-sex marriage “ will hurt families , and consequentially children and society. ” He also distorted his more recent advocacy work defending anti-gay discrimination . In 2010 , he filed an amicus brief in Christian Legal Society v. Martinez on behalf of Gays and Lesbians for Individual Liberty—a small group that brings together “ classical liberals , market liberals , limited-government libertarians , anarcho-capitalists , and objectivists ” to oppose nondiscrimination laws . VanDyke ’ s brief argued that student groups at public universities have a constitutional right to discriminate against gay students . On Wednesday , though , he was unwilling to say out loud that he had joined a group to side with religious liberty against gay students , so he pretended to have been for both .
What was VanDyke and his not-qualified rating and record of anti-gay advocacy doing in front of the Senate , anyway ? Let ’ s pause to remember that Donald Trump could have selected a fit conservative for this seat . ( Indeed , VanDyke testified alongside Patrick Bumatay , who was rated “ Qualified ” by the ABA , has no history of inflammatory remarks and is openly gay himself . ) But instead , Trump picked someone who , by the accounts of 60 interviewees , “ lacks humility , has an ‘ entitlement ’ temperament , does not have an open mind and does not always have a commitment to being candid and truthful . ”
VanDyke is the ninth judge Trump has nominated who has received such a rating from the ABA , which has been conducting evaluations of judicial nominees since 1953 ( five of these “ not qualified ” judges have been confirmed , two were denied , and , like VanDyke , one ’ s nomination is still pending ) . It claims the assessments are nonpartisan evaluations and based on three metrics : professional competence , integrity , and judicial temperament . Of the 255 evaluations the ABA standing committee has completed for Trump nominations , 97 percent have been rated “ qualified ” or “ well qualified. ” Having assessments from local counsel and judges who actually work with the nominee is generally useful , which is why Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham continues to say the ratings are helpful .
By the accounts of 60 interviewees , VanDyke “ lacks humility , has an ‘ entitlement ’ temperament , does not have an open mind and does not always have a commitment to being candid and truthful . ”
But at this most recent confirmation hearing , Republicans decided they ’ d had enough of the ABA . As Utah Sen. Mike Lee insisted on Wednesday , any group that doesn ’ t rate 100 percent of Donald Trump ’ s judicial picks as qualified is by definition biased and useless . Or as Lee put it , “ The ABA has essentially called you a homophobic bigot … with no apparent basis. ” Never mind that as Montana solicitor general in 2013 , he advocated for the state to join two abhorrent briefs arguing against marriage equality that disparaged LGBTQ families , suggesting legal recognition of same-sex partnerships would harm children . The first claimed that a prohibition on same-sex marriage was necessary to promote “ optimal childrearing ” because gay couples “ can not provide ” the optimal “ family structure ” ( the position he claimed to have disavowed after 2004 ) . And the second alleged that states “ may rationally conclude ” that “ it is better ” for parents to have a “ biological ” connection to their children .
Why does the Trump administration believe that someone who has done nothing but push fringe legal notions into the mainstream is fit to serve on a federal appellate bench ? It ’ s a puzzler . But unlike some of Trump ’ s nominees , VanDyke at least has legal experience on which he can be judged . He served as solicitor general of Montana and Nevada , in 2013–14 and from 2015–18 , respectively . While he served as Montana ’ s solicitor general , he spent much of his time working on amicus briefs filed in other states , giving us a clear sense of his ideology . Many of those briefs dealt with constitutional challenges to state and federal gun laws , abortion , and same-sex marriage . ( VanDyke has a knack for controversy : He also penned a discredited article arguing that “ intelligent design , ” a form of creationism , should be taught in public schools . He did it in this century ! )
In 2013 , VanDyke co-authored a brief in an abortion case seeking the wholesale reconsideration of Roe v. Wade . As the Las Vegas Sun editorialized this week about his extreme tendencies , “ VanDyke was so gung-ho about joining Montana into one politically charged case that he committed to it without even bothering to review the legal document at issue. ” The Sun went on to note that “ emails from Montana also showed that VanDyke worked hand-in-hand with the Federalist Society , the hugely powerful conservative legal organization , from which VanDyke asked for help while ‘ having trouble coming up with any plausible ( much less good ) arguments ’ in a guns case. ” And while he served as Nevada ’ s solicitor general , VanDyke was not even admitted to the state bar , even after a temporary two-year waiver expired .
But Republican senators did not dig into most of this , nor did they probe VanDyke ’ s record of extreme and punitive anti-gay , anti-women , pro-gun advocacy on Wednesday . Rather , they took turns bashing the ABA for its scathing assessment . To discredit the group ’ s rating , Republicans drew from a playbook laid out by Mike Davis , a former clerk for Justice Neil Gorsuch who lobbies for Trump ’ s judicial nominees , on Twitter Tuesday night . Lee accused the ABA of having “ lost its credibility as a neutral arbiter ” and operating as a “ special interest group. ” He urged the White House “ to suspend the unique access that the American Bar Association has ” to nominees “ until such time as a thorough investigation and review is undertaken to inquire into ” its investigative methods . Hawley zeroed in on the fact that Marcia Davenport , the ABA ’ s chief evaluator of VanDyke , donated $ 150 to his opponent in a 2014 Montana Supreme Court race .
Let ’ s stipulate that Davenport was not an ideal candidate to lead the ABA ’ s assessment of VanDyke . But let ’ s also remember that after Davenport filed her initial report , a full committee of 15 ABA members supported , by majority vote , the rating of “ not qualified. ” And that after this vote , the organization conducted a supplemental review and held a second vote , which led to the same result . And that 60 interviewees delivered the opinion that VanDyke was an entitled partisan .
The GOP ’ s talking points reek of cynical hypocrisy . Davis complained on Tuesday that the ABA is a “ dark-money group. ” That is an unusual description of an organization that boasts more than 400,000 dues-paying members , since a typical “ dark-money group ” receives secret donations from a few high-dollar donors . In fact , Davis ’ own Article III Project certainly fits that definition—as does the Judicial Crisis Network , another organization that lobbies for Trump ’ s nominees , including VanDyke . In fact , VanDyke himself has reaped the benefits of dark money . The same year that Davenport donated her $ 150 to his opponent for the Montana Supreme Court , VanDyke was boosted by hundreds of thousands of dollars in dark money spending on his candidacy . ( He still lost badly . ) Apparently Davis ’ attack on a storied legal institution and a $ 150 donation from a single member , is not , in his view , compromised by the multimillion-dollar dark money campaigns at work to goose spectacularly ill-qualified nominees to lifetime appointments .
It is more than likely that the Senate will confirm VanDyke—just as it has confirmed other nominees who are flagrantly partisan , or lacking in judicial temperament or experience . These are the qualities the president seeks in his judges , and these are the judges that Senate Republicans want . Yes , it will further degrade the institution of the judiciary to put objectively unqualified zealots on the bench . But degrading the institution is part of the game plan . Donald Trump has told us on many occasions of his contempt for an independent judicial branch . The mystery isn ’ t so much why VanDyke cried when confronted with his own legal legacy , but why he didn ’ t embrace it . After all , he probably wouldn ’ t have been sitting under the klieg lights in the first place if he hadn ’ t spent his career trying to strip rights from others .

The president has been railing about his own Justice Department ’ s apparent inaction ( after signaling , post-election , that he did not want to see the Clintons further investigated and prosecuted ) .

This suggests a basic misunderstanding about what triggers a special-counsel investigation : There must be potential offenses that warrant investigation as to which the Justice Department has a conflict of interest that would make its conducting the investigation inappropriate .
Preliminarily , we should note that there is no such thing as an independent counsel . In our constitutional system , prosecution is an executive power , so even special counsels ultimately report to the Justice Department ’ s leadership . That being the case , we should never have a special counsel unless one is absolutely necessary .

These prosecutors are insulated from the pressures of an ordinary prosecutor ’ s office , where cases have to compete for resources and only the meritorious ones are pursued . Thus , the sorry history of the special counsel ( and its predecessors — the “ special prosecutor ” and “ independent counsel ” ) is empire-building , investigations that go on for years , and cases involving trivial charges often far removed from the suspected offense that was the original rationale for appointing the special counsel .
I argued against the appointment of a special counsel to probe Trump-Russia because , for all the chatter about collusion , no concrete offenses warranting a criminal investigation were identified . ( Recall that Robert Mueller was appointed to take over a counterintelligence investigation , not to investigate specific crimes .

On this point , a letter sent to the House Judiciary Committee by Assistant Attorney General Stephen E. Boyd , reported on by the New York Times , is instructive . In pertinent part , the Boyd letter states :
Senior prosecutors will report directly to the attorney general and the deputy attorney general , as appropriate , and will make recommendations as to whether any matters not currently under investigation should be opened , whether any matters currently under investigation require further resources , or whether any matters merit a special counsel . [ Emphasis added . ]
This implies that there are relevant matters currently under investigation , and that these matters are being explored in the normal course , without the need of a special counsel . That is as it should be .
As the Times points out , Attorney General Jeff Sessions has recused himself from matters related to the 2016 election , and that recusal is apparently being expansively construed to include matters related to the Democratic nominee , Mrs. Clinton , even if such matters had no direct connection to the 2016 election . This recusal should not trigger a special-counsel appointment .
It is not unusual for attorneys general to be recused from some investigations owing to conflicts of interest . ( Often , the conflicts stem from the AG ’ s prior work as a private lawyer representing business clients who become enmeshed , for whatever reason , in investigations . ) When that happens , the deputy attorney general becomes the AG for purposes of the investigation . In the event , such conflicts have little bearing on how cases are handled because the investigation is led by the FBI with the assistance of a district U.S. attorney ’ s office that does not have a conflict . ( And if it does , each U.S. attorney ’ s office has procedures to screen out a conflicted prosecutor ; or the Justice Department can assign the case to a different district U.S. attorney who has no conflict . )
When political officials prod law-enforcement officials on individual cases , they hurt the prosecution .
All of that said , there is a problem here — just not a problem that requires a special counsel . It ’ s that the president and congressional Republicans are ratcheting up political pressure for prosecutorial action . Ultimately , this will undermine — perhaps fatally — any investigation the Justice Department may be doing . Inadvertently , the president and his congressional allies are giving any eventual defendants a powerful claim that they were charged because of political considerations rather than evidence of wrongdoing .
As I observed in a recent column , the president ’ s foolish commentary has already negatively affected the court-martial of Bowe Bergdahl , and it has complicated the possible filing of capital murder charges against Sayfullo Saipov , the West Side Highway jihadist . When political officials prod law-enforcement officials on individual cases , they hurt the prosecution .
Which brings me to the last point . Republicans should stop grousing about a special counsel and hope Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein has the good sense to assign any Clinton investigation to a credible counsel . What is needed here is a scrupulous , experienced , skillful prosecutor — preferably , a district U.S. attorney with an excellent staff — who has not commented publicly on the matters under investigation and whose integrity is beyond question . By clamoring for the Clintons to be investigated , the president and his allies have ensured that an investigation run by any lawyer who is not above reproach is doomed to fail .
We don ’ t need a “ special counsel. ” A very good one will do . And then he or she should be left alone to do the job .
The Trump Collusion Case Is Not Getting the Clinton Emails Treatment","Bill and Hillary Clinton at the Jefferson-Jackson Dinner in Des Moines, Iowa, October 2015. (Reuters photo: Mark Kauzlarich)

What we need is a credible prosecutor.

Republicans, whether in the White House or on Capitol Hill, do not seem to appreciate how much they may be undermining what they say they want — a serious investigation of the Clinton Foundation and such related matters as the Uranium One transaction, the interplay between the foundation and the operation of the State Department during Secretary Clinton’s tenure, and the question of whether that interplay explains the use of the improper private email system and the destruction of tens of thousands of emails.

The president has been railing about his own Justice Department’s apparent inaction (after signaling, post-election, that he did not want to see the Clintons further investigated and prosecuted). A group of House Republicans has taken up this cause and is pushing for the appointment of a special counsel. In essence, it is a tit-for-tat maneuver: There is a special-counsel probing Trump ties to Russia, they reason, so why not a special-counsel to probe Clinton ties to Russia?

This suggests a basic misunderstanding about what triggers a special-counsel investigation: There must be potential offenses that warrant investigation as to which the Justice Department has a conflict of interest that would make its conducting the investigation inappropriate.

Preliminarily, we should note that there is no such thing as an independent counsel. In our constitutional system, prosecution is an executive power, so even special counsels ultimately report to the Justice Department’s leadership. That being the case, we should never have a special counsel unless one is absolutely necessary. It is pernicious to have a prosecutor who is assigned to make a case on a single target (or set of targets). These prosecutors are insulated from the pressures of an ordinary prosecutor’s office, where cases have to compete for resources and only the meritorious ones are pursued. Thus, the sorry history of the special counsel (and its predecessors — the “special prosecutor” and “independent counsel”) is empire-building, investigations that go on for years, and cases involving trivial charges often far removed from the suspected offense that was the original rationale for appointing the special counsel.

I argued against the appointment of a special counsel to probe Trump-Russia because, for all the chatter about collusion, no concrete offenses warranting a criminal investigation were identified. (Recall that Robert Mueller was appointed to take over a counterintelligence investigation, not to investigate specific crimes. As I’ve repeatedly contended, this was outside the regulations.) But let’s assume for argument’s sake that there were such offenses. It would then be proper to have a special counsel, because otherwise the administration would be investigating itself. If the president and/or his campaign is the subject of the investigation, then the entire Justice Department — run by presidential appointees and subordinate to the president — has a conflict of interest.

This situation does not currently obtain with respect to the Clintons. It is commonplace for the Justice Department to conduct corruption investigations involving members of the president’s opposition party (as well as members of the president’s own party who are not among the Justice Department’s executive-branch superiors). There is no structural reason to believe the Justice Department is unable to conduct a fair investigation of the Clinton Foundation. (There may be a credibility problem, which we’ll get to momentarily.)

It is not unusual for attorneys general to be recused from some investigations owing to conflicts of interest. (Often, the conflicts stem from the AG’s prior work as a private lawyer representing business clients who become enmeshed, for whatever reason, in investigations.) When that happens, the deputy attorney general becomes the AG for purposes of the investigation. In the event, such conflicts have little bearing on how cases are handled because the investigation is led by the FBI with the assistance of a district U.S. attorney’s office that does not have a conflict. (And if it does, each U.S. attorney’s office has procedures to screen out a conflicted prosecutor; or the Justice Department can assign the case to a different district U.S. attorney who has no conflict.)

When political officials prod law-enforcement officials on individual cases, they hurt the prosecution.

All of that said, there is a problem here — just not a problem that requires a special counsel. It’s that the president and congressional Republicans are ratcheting up political pressure for prosecutorial action. Ultimately, this will undermine — perhaps fatally — any investigation the Justice Department may be doing. Inadvertently, the president and his congressional allies are giving any eventual defendants a powerful claim that they were charged because of political considerations rather than evidence of wrongdoing.

As I observed in a recent column, the president’s foolish commentary has already negatively affected the court-martial of Bowe Bergdahl, and it has complicated the possible filing of capital murder charges against Sayfullo Saipov, the West Side Highway jihadist. When political officials prod law-enforcement officials on individual cases, they hurt the prosecution.

Which brings me to the last point. Republicans should stop grousing about a special counsel and hope Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein has the good sense to assign any Clinton investigation to a credible counsel. What is needed here is a scrupulous, experienced, skillful prosecutor — preferably, a district U.S. attorney with an excellent staff — who has not commented publicly on the matters under investigation and whose integrity is beyond question. By clamoring for the Clintons to be investigated, the president and his allies have ensured that an investigation run by any lawyer who is not above reproach is doomed to fail.

We don’t need a “special counsel.” A very good one will do. And then he or she should be left alone to do the job.

In a series of early morning Twitter messages, Trump aired renewed frustration with his attorney general, the special counsel leading the Russia probe, and Republicans in Congress who are struggling to advance his legislative agenda.

But Trump’s comment about pardons, tucked into an attack on the media, raised the possibility that he was considering his options if the investigations do not turn out the way he hopes.

Trump did not specify who, if anyone, he might consider pardoning. His tweets appeared to be written in response to a report by The Washington Post this week that Trump and his legal team have examined presidential powers to pardon Trump aides, family members and possibly even himself.

Reuters has not confirmed the newspaper accounts.

“While all agree the U.S. President has the complete power to pardon, why think of that when only crime so far is LEAKS against us. FAKE NEWS,” Trump wrote.

The Washington Post, citing current and former U.S. officials, reported on Friday that Russia’s ambassador to the United States was overheard by U.S. spy agencies telling his bosses that he had discussed campaign-related matters with Trump adviser Jeff Sessions last year, when Sessions was a U.S. senator.

Sessions now leads the Justice Department as Trump’s attorney general.

“These illegal leaks...must stop,” Trump tweeted.

At the Senate confirmation hearings for his Cabinet position, Sessions initially failed to disclose his 2016 contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak and later said they were not about the campaign.

In March, Sessions recused himself from the Russia probe. During an interview with The New York Times this week, Trump lashed out at Sessions, saying he would not have chosen him for attorney general had he known Sessions would recuse himself.

Trump, who defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton in last year’s presidential election but continues to use her as a foil, questioned why Sessions and special counsel Robert Mueller were not investigating former FBI Director James Comey or Clinton, for her email practices as secretary of state.

“So many people are asking why isn’t the A.G. or Special Counsel looking at the many Hillary Clinton or Comey crimes. 33,000 emails deleted...,” he tweeted.

PRESIDENTIAL AUTHORITY

Scholars have raised questions about the scope of the president’s legal authority in issuing pardons. If Trump moved to pardon himself sometime in the future, the U.S. Supreme Court might have to decide on the constitutionality, some have speculated.

Trump has not been accused of any wrongdoing by federal investigators who are probing alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Mueller is looking into any relationships or contacts between Trump campaign officials and Russians during the election. Congressional committees also are exploring Russia’s influence on the U.S. election.

Trump traveled on Saturday to Norfolk, Virginia, where he spoke at a commissioning ceremony for the aircraft carrier the USS Gerald R. Ford, named for the Republican president who held the White House from 1974-1977.

In his remarks, Trump made no mention of the Russia controversy, focusing his speech on the need for more robust U.S. military spending.

After the trip, Trump retreated to his golf course near Washington and had lunch with his chief of staff, Reince Priebus, policy adviser Stephen Miller and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and his wife, a White House official said.

Priebus’s presence in the entourage came a day after Trump named a new communications director, Anthony Scaramucci, reportedly over Priebus’s objections.

Reps. Brad Sherman of California and Al Green of Texas have brought forward a formal article of impeachment against President Donald Trump for “high crimes and misdemeanors.”

It goes without saying these two congressmen are Democrats.

It does not go without laughing, however. Years and years and years ago, there was this show about animal research and the scientist had placed a soccer ball or something in the middle of a ring of monkeys. Every few seconds, a monkey would reach a hesitant hand toward the ball, only to be slapped away by the researcher. This went on — and on and on and on. Monkey reach, monkey slapped, monkey retreat — monkey reach again. The point was to show just how limited in brain development the monkeys really were, because their instincts to touch overcame their instincts to listen to their pain. It really did become comical after a while.

That’s how the Democrats are on impeachment. They just can’t help themselves.

After months and months and months of listening to the left call for Trump’s ouster from office — a call that laughingly began before Trump even took over the White House — the mantra has become monkeyish.

Now come Sherman and Green with the paperwork.

Sorry, fellas. Even CNN’s against you on this one.

“For starters,” wrote CNN’s digital director of politics, Z. Byron Wolf, there’s no indication that Trump is anywhere near to being impeached.”

Well, yeah. There is that. Typically — and this is just an opinion, from someone who’s not an attorney — there must be a crime committed before the charges are affixed.

The order of operation goes like this: Crime. Charge. Conviction — or acquittal. Sadly, the order for Democrats on Trump has been this — Charge. Move to convict. Now go find the crime.

And thanks to a very, very complicit and biased media, Democrats have been able to move forward with frightening speed on this order. But now they’ve lost a key asset — CNN. You know it’s bad for your leftist side when CNN reports in favor of a Republican.

The article of impeachment accuses Trump of interfering with the FBI’s investigation of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, and alleges the president “sought to use his authority to hinder and cause the termination of such investigations.”

Well, once again, good luck with that fellas. The House, controlled by Republicans, isn’t likely to pass the article. Democratic leaders, looking ahead to 2018 elections and realizing the crazy Rep. Maxine Waters has brought with her Tourette Syndrome-like call for impeachment, have distanced themselves from such talk — at least in earshot of the media. And the American people, even those who wouldn’t consider themselves in the Trump camp, aren’t at all ready for a Bill Clinton Redeux — that is, impeachment.

Green is simply partisan.

Back in May, he made it clear from the House floor: “This is where I stand. I will not be moved. The president must be impeached.”

He said it — that was his plan all along. Impeach Trump, facts, evidence and truth be danged. On one hand, it’s refreshing to see a politician actually honor a promise. On the other, going down in political history as one of the monkeys who couldn’t stop touching the soccer ball, despite the constant slap-down and sting, is not really all that commendable after all. Here’s a bit of advice for Democrats pursuing impeachment: Wait for the crime. The wheels of justice generally turn better that way.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions says he will recuse himself from any investigations into possible Russian involvement in the 2016 elections.

""Let me be clear: I never had meetings with Russian operatives or Russian intermediaries about the Trump campaign,"" Sessions reiterated during an afternoon news conference in response to reports that he had met twice with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. last year.

Lobbyist Mike McClain allegedly told the utility executive that , “ I would say to you don ’ t put anything in writing . ”
The two then discussed a “ favor ” for Madigan that federal prosecutors now say was part of a brazen , years-long Chicago-style bribery scheme that sent $ 1.3 million to Madigan ’ s associates for doing little or no work for the utility , all while ComEd hoped to land Madigan ’ s support for legislation in Springfield worth more than $ 150 million .
ComEd has now been charged in federal court with bribery and is expected to pay a $ 200 million fine — believed to be the largest criminal fine ever in Chicago ’ s federal court . Several politicians , including Democratic Gov . J.B. Pritzker , said Madigan should resign if the allegations against one of the most powerful Democrats in the state are true .
While the bombshell case implicates several individuals in the alleged scheme , no one else has been criminally charged . And that includes Madigan .
“ Our investigation is ongoing , ” U.S. Attorney John Lausch said repeatedly at a Friday news conference outside the Dirksen Federal Courthouse when asked about additional criminal charges .
In fact , the feds earlier on Friday hit Madigan with a fresh subpoena that appears to seriously expand the investigation , with inquiries about AT & T Services Inc. , Walgreens and Rush University Medical Center . The document , obtained by the Sun-Times , also seeks records concerning a laundry list of Madigan ’ s top supporters , including former Aldermen Mike Zalewski and Frank OIivo , current 13th Ward Ald . Marty Quinn , ComEd and Exelon , McClain , properties in Chinatown , previously written about by the Sun-Times , and former Ald . Danny Solis .
Walgreens had no comment . AT & T did not respond to a request for comment . Rush said in a statement only that it “ has received and is cooperating with a subpoena for records reflecting work by , and communications with , certain government relations consultants for the period 2014 to the present . ”
The Sun-Times first revealed in January 2019 that Solis has for years cooperated with federal prosecutors . It also reported that the FBI recorded Madigan during a meeting with Solis and a developer hoping to build a hotel also in the Chinatown neighborhood . The Sun-Times report about the feds ’ Madigan recording , also in January 2019 , landed nine days before McClain told the ComEd vice president on Feb. 7 , 2019 , not to put things in writing .
Solis also helped the feds build their case against indicted 14th Ward Ald . Ed Burke . A grand jury number on the subpoena delivered to Madigan on Friday matches the grand jury number in the Burke case , court records show .
A Madigan spokeswoman said Friday in a statement that he plans to cooperate and “ has done nothing criminal or improper . ”
“ The speaker has never helped someone find a job with the expectation that the person would not be asked to perform work by their employer , nor did he ever expect to provide anything to a prospective employer if it should choose to hire a person he recommended , ” the statement said . “ He has never made a legislative decision with improper motives and has engaged in no wrongdoing here . Any claim to the contrary is unfounded . ”
The court document outlining the bribery details against ComEd largely paints a picture of McClain pressuring ComEd officials to give jobs , contracts and money to Madigan associates .
It alleges that Madigan and McClain sought from ComEd jobs , contracts and money for various Madigan associates between 2011 and 2019 , and that McClain acted on Madigan ’ s behalf .
The court documents in the case do not identify Madigan , or even McClain , by name . Rather , they refer to a “ Public Official A ” who serves as the speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives . The Sun-Times has separately identified McClain as the person identified in the documents as “ Individual A . ”
Madigan ’ s quiet but iron-fisted control over his chamber has earned him the nickname “ The Velvet Hammer , ” and lobbyists and fellow legislators frequently toss around the maxim , “ Never bet against the speaker. ” The 78-year-old harkens back to the days of the late Mayor Richard J. Daley , whom Madigan considers his mentor .
The criminal charge against ComEd follows more than a year of intrigue regarding the feds ’ public corruption investigations and whether their work would ever touch Madigan . The new allegations against him became public as part of a deal ComEd struck with the U.S. Attorney ’ s office commonly known as a deferred-prosecution agreement . If ComEd abides by the terms of the three-year arrangement , the bribery charge filed Friday is expected to be dismissed .
The agreement said ComEd will cooperate in the prosecutors ’ investigations . Unlike in other such agreements , though , ComEd is not expected to plead guilty and formally admit to the criminal conduct . A judge still has to approve the deal .
A statement of facts attached to the agreement lays out the details of the allegations . They include claims that Madigan sought a job for Zalewski upon his retirement from the City Council , that Madigan had for decades ran an “ old-fashioned patronage system ” including getting people jobs as ComEd meter readers , that Madigan had an associate appointed to ComEd ’ s board of directors in 2019 — former McPier CEO Juan Ochoa — and even that ComEd hired students from Madigan ’ s ward for an internship program .
The allegations in the document date back to 2011 , when it said McClain and a lobbyist identified by the Sun-Times as John Hooker developed a plan to help two Madigan associates by funneling money through a consulting company and treating them as subcontractors . ComEd would not pay the unidentified men directly but rather increase its payments to the consulting company to cover the two Madigan associates . Meanwhile , contracts and invoices made it falsely appear that those payments were in return for the consultant ’ s advice on “ legislative issues ” and “ legislative risk management activities . ”
Read the documents An information and statement of facts filed in federal court Friday end a federal criminal investigation into a years-long bribery scheme . Read the complete legal documents here .
In May 2018 Madigan — through McClain — allegedly asked then-ComEd CEO Anne Pramaggiore to hire Zalewski , the feds allege . Another deal was then struck to pay Zalewski $ 5,000 monthly as a subcontractor for the consultant . Pramaggiore allegedly agreed that Madigan would get to tell Zalewski about the arrangement .
A spokesman for Pramaggiore , who later became a senior executive for Exelon but retired last year , said in a statement that “ Ms . Pramaggiore has done nothing wrong and any inference to the contrary is misguided and false . ”
Also in May 2018 , McClain allegedly told the ComEd vice president — identified by the Sun-Times as Fidel Marquez — why the Madigan associates were being paid . He explained that one of them was “ one of the top three precinct captains ” who also “ trains people how to go door to door . . . so just to give you an idea how important the guy is . ”
Marquez could not be reached for comment Friday , nor could McClain .
In February 2019 , McClain allegedly told Hooker how to explain the payments within the company . McClain allegedly said , “ We had to hire these guys because ( Madigan ) came to us . It ’ s just that simple . ”
Two days later , the consultant allegedly cautioned Marquez that ComEd should not tamper with the arrangement because “ your money comes from Springfield ” and the consultant had “ every reason to believe ” McClain had spoken to Madigan about the deal .
The consultant allegedly added that the Madigan associates “ keep their mouth shut , and , you know , so . But , do they do anything for me on a day-to-day basis ? No. ” He said the payments were made “ to keep ( Madigan ) happy , I think it ’ s worth it , because you ’ d hear otherwise . ”
The document also alleges Madigan sought the appointment of Ochoa to the ComEd board of directors through McClain in 2017 . However , opposition within the company to that appointment in May 2018 allegedly prompted Pramaggiore to ask McClain if Madigan would be satisfied with a part-time job for Ochoa that paid the same amount as the board position — $ 78,000 a year .
McClain allegedly told Pramaggiore that Madigan would appreciate it if she would “ keep pressing ” for the appointment . Pramaggiore allegedly agreed to do so , telling McClain later in the year that , “ you take good care of me and so does our friend ( Madigan ) and I will do the best that I can to , to take care of you . ”
Finally , the document alleges that ComEd agreed in 2011 to retain a law firm in an attempt to influence Madigan . When that law firm ’ s contract came up for renewal in 2016 , it said ComEd sought to reduce the hours of legal work down from 850 hours specified in an earlier agreement . An attorney from the law firm then complained to McClain .
That ’ s when McClain allegedly wrote to Pramaggiore , reminding her “ how valuable ” that lawyer was to “ our Friend . ”
He added , “ I know the drill , and so do you . If you do not get involve ( sic ) and resolve this issue of 850 hours for his law firm per year then he will go to our Friend. ” He allegedly wrote that Madigan “ will call me , and then I will call you . ”
He concluded , “ Is this a drill we must go through ? ”","Early last year, when federal investigations into public corruption dominated the headlines, a longtime ally of House Speaker Michael Madigan gave a little advice to a ComEd vice president, according to an explosive court document filed Friday.

Lobbyist Mike McClain allegedly told the utility executive that, “I would say to you don’t put anything in writing.”

“All it can do is hurt ya,” he added.

Walgreens had no comment. AT&T did not respond to a request for comment. Rush said in a statement only that it “has received and is cooperating with a subpoena for records reflecting work by, and communications with, certain government relations consultants for the period 2014 to the present.”

Solis also helped the feds build their case against indicted 14th Ward Ald. Ed Burke. A grand jury number on the subpoena delivered to Madigan on Friday matches the grand jury number in the Burke case, court records show.

A Madigan spokeswoman said Friday in a statement that he plans to cooperate and “has done nothing criminal or improper.”

“The speaker has never helped someone find a job with the expectation that the person would not be asked to perform work by their employer, nor did he ever expect to provide anything to a prospective employer if it should choose to hire a person he recommended,” the statement said. “He has never made a legislative decision with improper motives and has engaged in no wrongdoing here. Any claim to the contrary is unfounded.”

The court document outlining the bribery details against ComEd largely paints a picture of McClain pressuring ComEd officials to give jobs, contracts and money to Madigan associates.

It alleges that Madigan and McClain sought from ComEd jobs, contracts and money for various Madigan associates between 2011 and 2019, and that McClain acted on Madigan’s behalf.

The court documents in the case do not identify Madigan, or even McClain, by name. Rather, they refer to a “Public Official A” who serves as the speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives. The Sun-Times has separately identified McClain as the person identified in the documents as “Individual A.”

Madigan’s quiet but iron-fisted control over his chamber has earned him the nickname “The Velvet Hammer,” and lobbyists and fellow legislators frequently toss around the maxim, “Never bet against the speaker.” The 78-year-old harkens back to the days of the late Mayor Richard J. Daley, whom Madigan considers his mentor.

The criminal charge against ComEd follows more than a year of intrigue regarding the feds’ public corruption investigations and whether their work would ever touch Madigan. The new allegations against him became public as part of a deal ComEd struck with the U.S. Attorney’s office commonly known as a deferred-prosecution agreement. If ComEd abides by the terms of the three-year arrangement, the bribery charge filed Friday is expected to be dismissed.

The agreement said ComEd will cooperate in the prosecutors’ investigations. Unlike in other such agreements, though, ComEd is not expected to plead guilty and formally admit to the criminal conduct. A judge still has to approve the deal.

A statement of facts attached to the agreement lays out the details of the allegations. They include claims that Madigan sought a job for Zalewski upon his retirement from the City Council, that Madigan had for decades ran an “old-fashioned patronage system” including getting people jobs as ComEd meter readers, that Madigan had an associate appointed to ComEd’s board of directors in 2019 — former McPier CEO Juan Ochoa — and even that ComEd hired students from Madigan’s ward for an internship program.

The allegations in the document date back to 2011, when it said McClain and a lobbyist identified by the Sun-Times as John Hooker developed a plan to help two Madigan associates by funneling money through a consulting company and treating them as subcontractors. ComEd would not pay the unidentified men directly but rather increase its payments to the consulting company to cover the two Madigan associates. Meanwhile, contracts and invoices made it falsely appear that those payments were in return for the consultant’s advice on “legislative issues” and “legislative risk management activities.”

Read the documents An information and statement of facts filed in federal court Friday end a federal criminal investigation into a years-long bribery scheme. Read the complete legal documents here.

In May 2018 Madigan — through McClain — allegedly asked then-ComEd CEO Anne Pramaggiore to hire Zalewski, the feds allege. Another deal was then struck to pay Zalewski $5,000 monthly as a subcontractor for the consultant. Pramaggiore allegedly agreed that Madigan would get to tell Zalewski about the arrangement.

A spokesman for Pramaggiore, who later became a senior executive for Exelon but retired last year, said in a statement that “Ms. Pramaggiore has done nothing wrong and any inference to the contrary is misguided and false.”

Also in May 2018, McClain allegedly told the ComEd vice president — identified by the Sun-Times as Fidel Marquez — why the Madigan associates were being paid. He explained that one of them was “one of the top three precinct captains” who also “trains people how to go door to door . . . so just to give you an idea how important the guy is.”

Marquez could not be reached for comment Friday, nor could McClain.

In February 2019, McClain allegedly told Hooker how to explain the payments within the company. McClain allegedly said, “We had to hire these guys because (Madigan) came to us. It’s just that simple.”

Two days later, the consultant allegedly cautioned Marquez that ComEd should not tamper with the arrangement because “your money comes from Springfield” and the consultant had “every reason to believe” McClain had spoken to Madigan about the deal.

The consultant allegedly added that the Madigan associates “keep their mouth shut, and, you know, so. But, do they do anything for me on a day-to-day basis? No.” He said the payments were made “to keep (Madigan) happy, I think it’s worth it, because you’d hear otherwise.”

The document also alleges Madigan sought the appointment of Ochoa to the ComEd board of directors through McClain in 2017. However, opposition within the company to that appointment in May 2018 allegedly prompted Pramaggiore to ask McClain if Madigan would be satisfied with a part-time job for Ochoa that paid the same amount as the board position — $78,000 a year.

McClain allegedly told Pramaggiore that Madigan would appreciate it if she would “keep pressing” for the appointment. Pramaggiore allegedly agreed to do so, telling McClain later in the year that, “you take good care of me and so does our friend (Madigan) and I will do the best that I can to, to take care of you.”

Finally, the document alleges that ComEd agreed in 2011 to retain a law firm in an attempt to influence Madigan. When that law firm’s contract came up for renewal in 2016, it said ComEd sought to reduce the hours of legal work down from 850 hours specified in an earlier agreement. An attorney from the law firm then complained to McClain.

That’s when McClain allegedly wrote to Pramaggiore, reminding her “how valuable” that lawyer was to “our Friend.”

He added, “I know the drill, and so do you. If you do not get involve (sic) and resolve this issue of 850 hours for his law firm per year then he will go to our Friend.” He allegedly wrote that Madigan “will call me, and then I will call you.”

He concluded, “Is this a drill we must go through?”

justice,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/21312191/police-reform-defunding-abolition-black-lives-matter-protests,"Police reform, defunding, and abolition, explained",2020-07-16,Aaron Ross Coleman,"A recent political ad , sponsored by the conservative State Government Leadership Foundation , imagines the hellscape of a post-police Minneapolis . A terrified white woman jolts awake at 2 am during a home invasion . She alerts her husband . She grabs her phone . She calls the police . But it ’ s too late . They have all been defunded . A dispatcher informs her that a “ human resources ” specialist can ’ t help her right now as the camera pans over her sleeping child , the burglar advancing ominously . “ Radical liberals are fighting for a police-free future , ” the narrator intones . “ Don ’ t let them put your family in danger . ”
There is one thing — and only one thing — the ad gets right : On all sides , in all directions , the debate over the future of policing remains a debate over safety , driven by communities who desperately , deeply want to feel safe .
In the aftermath of George Floyd ’ s killing at the hands of police , virtually every faction in American politics — from Trump Republicans to Biden Democrats , from Cato libertarians to intersectional Marxists — says they want to change policing .
On one end of the spectrum stand abolitionists , who want to “ delegitimize the police. ” These activists demand an entirely new public safety system based on social and economic equity , bolstered by a network of nonviolent emergency responders . They are offering more than a different vision for public safety — they are offering a different vision for the composition , and fundamental assumptions , of society . They have a different view of what causes crime . In the world they imagine , America would spend much more on education , health care , and infrastructure , and nothing on police departments as we currently know them .
On the other end stand reformers , who want to “ restore legitimacy to the police. ” This group seeks to implement procedural reforms to make officers more accountable and effective . They also , in general , want to spend more on policing . Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden ’ s plan , for instance , spends more on education and health care and infrastructure , but also more on policing : He ’ s proposed a $ 300 million increase to the Community Oriented Policing Services ( COPS ) program .
Countless opinions dot the range between — in particular , the “ defund the police ” movement ( more on that in a moment ) . Much of the debate remains contentious , particularly on how best to defeat violent crime . Yet even amid consternation , bad faith , polarization , disagreement , and partisanship , a common refrain cuts across the parties : America relies too heavily on the police for unrelated services .
“ We need alternatives to policing , ” says Thenjiwe McHarris , an activist in the Movement for Black Lives and a police abolitionist . “ If someone is sleeping on a bench , if there ’ s a mental health issue , policing is the one tactic⁠ — often a failed tactic⁠ — used in our communities for the range of needs our people have . ”
“ The reality is we have turned to police to handle a lot of problems in society that nobody else wanted to do⁠ — to handle issues around substance abuse , to handle issues around the homeless , to handle issues around mental health , ” says Laurie Robinson , who chaired President Obama ’ s Task Force on 21st Century Policing , which produced the basic agenda of the police reform movement . “ I think they would be very happy to hand off these responsibilities . ”
Likewise , former NYPD sergeant and Burlington Police Chief Brandon del Pozo asked : “ Why are we still asking the police as untrained interventionists to deal with people who are overdosing and using drugs or as barely trained crisis interventionists to deal with mental health when we can piggyback or create separate apparatuses that handle that for us ? ”
This cross-coalitional interest in reassigning nonviolent services presents the most promising opportunity for ambitious change to a country rollicked by weeks , and years , of protest against racist policing . In an opening bid , abolitionists have suggested rerouting 50 percent of police budgets to other civil services .
But understanding the areas for compromise also requires seeing where the different visions conflict . So let ’ s go through them in turn .
The police reform movement stands atop two premises . Good policing is good . Reams of research show it does , in fact , reduce violent crime . But bad policing is bad . It ’ s bad on its own terms , because it harms the people it brutalizes , and it ’ s bad because it delegitimizes the police in the eyes of the community they ’ re meant to serve .
In Milwaukee , for instance , an important study showed that 911 calls fell after a publicized case of police brutality . The harm of bad policing , in other words , was both the police brutality and the severing of the relationship between the community and the public agency meant to keep them safe .
Police reformers , then , are trying to do two things at the same time : Make sure there are enough police to keep violent crime low , and make sure those police are both well-trained enough and tightly constrained enough not to abuse their power .
The Obama administration ’ s Task Force on 21st Century Policing formed just after the 2014 uprising in Ferguson , Missouri , and published its report immediately after the 2015 Baltimore uprising . Its policy goals were a shift in policing culture , use of force , transparency , and fairness . As with universal pre-K , a $ 15 minimum wage , free community college , and a federal jobs program , the report articulated a progressive vision that was never fully achieved . Yet today , as establishment politicians respond to protesters ’ calls for change , the task force ’ s report still offers a window into how traditional reformers imagine a new American policing paradigm .
“ The reality is we have turned to police to handle a lot of problems in society that nobody else wanted to do⁠ — to handle issues around substance abuse , to handle issues around the homeless , to handle issues around mental health ”
Among the report ’ s 59 recommendations were that officers “ acknowledge the role of policing in past and present injustice and discrimination ” ; avoid violence against “ children , elderly persons , pregnant women , people with physical and mental disabilities , limited English proficiency , and others ” ; and “ adopt and enforce policies prohibiting profiling and discrimination based on race , ethnicity , national origin , religion , age , gender , gender identity/expression , sexual orientation , immigration status , disability , housing status , occupation , or language fluency . ”
The task force envisioned officers who are friendly , mentally well-adjusted , highly trained “ guardians. ” Through incentives , curriculums , and hiring programs , departments would create officers who prioritize deescalation and nonviolent intervention , abide by strict anti-discrimination laws , operate under strong transparency protocols , and stand accountable to local civilians .
Under this plan , police are not abolished ; they are enlightened .
The authors also call for expanding the use of social workers and other nonviolent crisis specialists to supplement police officers . The report recommends reducing crime “ through a variety of programs that focus on public health , education , mental health , and other programs not traditionally part of the criminal justice system. ” This broader response to crime represents an area of overlap with the more progressive protests demanding alternatives to policing .
Robinson , the co-chair of the task force , says the ethos of the document has entered into the bloodstream of American policing . Citing a survey of 47 of the largest law enforcement agencies in the United States from 2015 to 2017 conducted by the Major Cities Chiefs Association ( MCCA ) and the National Police Foundation , Robinson notes that 39 percent of the departments updated their use of force policies and incorporated deescalation training . The survey also reported that officer-involved shootings during this period dropped by 21 percent .
While these data points highlight good news , Robinson also underscores that administrative barriers prevented the policy recommendations from becoming universal policing standards across the country .
“ We have a highly decentralized system , ” she says . “ We have 18,000 separate and very independent state and local law enforcement agencies that are operated and run by , in our case , many local independent mayors and city managers who are responsible for operating and overseeing those local departments. ” This fragmented bureaucracy clashing and the strength of police unions makes even the more modest reforms suggested in the policing task force more difficult to enact . But Robinson — and Obama — remains optimistic that the report ’ s recommendations remain the right path forward .
“ We know there are specific evidence-based reforms that if we put [ them ] in place today would build trust , save lives , would not show an increase in crime , ” Obama said in a statement following George Floyd ’ s death . “ Those are included in the 21st-Century Policing Task Force report . ”
Thomas Abt , another Obama administration alum and author of Bleeding Out , a book on policing urban violence , said in principle he supports conversations around what roles police served and how they might be scaled back . Yet he remains worried about the tenor of the current defunding conversation .
“ I am supportive of asking these big questions about whether we can start winnowing down the police role . But you don ’ t do that by just slashing police budgets , without a broader conversation about who ’ s going to step up and fill the gap , ” Abt says .
“ I worry that people don ’ t understand what it takes to set up a first responder operation . It took us well over a century to put together police , fire , EMT , ” he continues . “ To have a government service capable of responding in real time to these things is an enormous undertaking . ”
Abt and other more traditional reformers continued to see a central role for American police in society . Abt supports a mix of police reforms to increase transparency and curtail the use of force while also deploying surges of concentrated policing in the most violent neighborhoods .
But to the defunders and abolitionists , reform has been tried , and it has been found wanting . This year , the police department in Tucson , Arizona , was noted as “ progressive ” and “ reform-minded ” and had “ banned chokeholds and shooting at moving vehicles , embracing a range of measures aimed at reducing police violence , ” according to the New York Times . Yet local officers still killed Carlos Ingram-Lopez , a Latino man who was reportedly naked and experiencing a mental health crisis when he was killed , and withheld the video for months . Likewise , in Minneapolis , Minnesota , which was celebrated for its progressive mayor , a former civil rights attorney , and their reform-minded police chief , city employees still killed George Floyd .
Last month , the Washington Post published an article that cautioned that after a recession budget crunch , Vallejo , California , “ defunded its police department ” and officer killings shot up , while crime enforcement plummeted . “ Vallejo ’ s experience offers a glimpse of what a reduced police presence on America ’ s streets could mean as defunding continues to gain traction , ” the piece warned .
But austerity-driven disinvestment is not the future defunders want . ( It also does not accurately represent the public policy vision that defund advocates are fighting for , as the Washington Post later clarified in the article . )
“ Part of the push here is that we know what we want to defund — the other part about the demands for what we need , ” says defund advocate and Illinois state Sen. Robert Peters ( D ) . “ Folks often get caught up in this ‘ oh , my god ’ of demanding to defund the police . People need to know there ’ s a whole host of other demands attached to that , which are about uplifting community . ”
In essence , defunding exists as a suite of public policy ideas premised on investments in individual well-being , community infrastructure , alternative first responder services , and divestment from the use of lethal force .
Defunders don ’ t just emphasize expanding social programs and investments but also removing money from police departments . They argue that the swelling police budgets fuel violence and corruption .
Advocates like the Center for Popular Democracy ’ s Kumar Rao argue that police departments run on a broken financial feedback loop where , after poorly policing communities of color and running up huge legal fees for abuse , torture , and unjust killings , departments are rewarded with larger budgets the next year , funding a cycle of violence .
“ Part of the problem here is the amount of money that has gone toward policing over the last several decades , ” says Rao . “ We ’ re now reaching a point where we spend over $ 100 billion every year on policing . That kind of spending on policing has entrenched an institution and has made it ultimately unaccountable . ”
For Rao , increasing police budgets increases the number of officers , which increases the scope of officers ’ duties , which increases officers ’ interactions with civilians , which increases opportunities for police violence .
Beyond issues of corruption , defunders also argue that reliance on police departments is poor execution of public policy because police specialize in violent crime , but violent crime only represents a small portion of the sprawling civil services they perform . They believe the money could be used more effectively elsewhere .
Take traffic , for example , where police spend nearly 20 percent of their time working in some cities . Experts like Transportation Alternatives deputy director Marco Conner DiAquoi argue that it is both safer and more efficient for cities to manage traffic through transportation infrastructure investments , automated enforcement , and specialized civilian first responders rather than through police .
“ Police officer-based enforcement is less effective than infrastructural alternatives , like street redesigns and automated enforcement , and puts people of color at risk , ” DiAquoi and co-authors write in “ The Case for Self-Enforcing Streets. ” The report , published in June by Transportation Alternatives , seeks to remedy the ways in which enforcement of traffic laws leads to discretionary and often biased policing of minorities .
In New York City , DiAquoi argues , many of the violations that are cited in minority neighborhoods are the natural upshot of poor infrastructure in segregated communities — elements like a bike lane , quality sidewalks , or well-designed streets . DiAquoi and the other co-authors make a case for reallocating “ significant portions ” of the NYPD ’ s budget to the Department of Transportation to “ increase investments in street design and automated enforcement to create ‘ self-enforcing ’ streets ” which would “ reduce the ability of police officers to violate civil rights , cause property damage , or otherwise participate in sueable offenses . ”
Decriminalization illuminates another part of the vision behind defunding . Defunders — like many others — believe the war on drugs has been racist and ineffective , and we should simply end it . And if we end it , it makes sense for police budgets , which have grown in part because of the drug war , to be cut .
In Alex Vitale ’ s The End of Policing , the Brooklyn College sociologist explains how Portugal successfully decriminalized drug use in 1999 ; it handed over drug harm reduction to health officials , reaping “ very favorable ” results , with most drug use “ now treated as a health problem . ”
“ Studies have found significant reductions in heroin addiction , overdoses , and disease transmission , ” Vitale writes of the country . “ In 1999 , Portugal had the highest rate of HIV infection among injecting drug users in the European Union ; by 2009 , the number of newly diagnosed HIV cases among drug users had decreased substantially. ” Likewise , reporting on Portugal ’ s decriminalization of drugs for the New York Times , journalist Nicholas Kristof found “ the number of heroin users there fell by three-quarters , and the overdose fatality rate was the lowest in Western Europe . ”
“ Meanwhile , after decades of policing , the United States was losing about 70,000 Americans a year from overdoses , ” Kristof continued . “ In effect , Portugal appeared to be winning the war on drugs by ending it . ”
Even scholars like Stanford University ’ s Keith Humphreys , who has been skeptical of the methodology used in the Portugal research , note that similar results can be seen in the United States . Citing data from the Criminal Justice Statistics Center , Humphreys notes that after California lawmakers decriminalized marijuana , the state saw decreased interaction with the police . According to the study , marijuana possession arrests in California dropped by 86 percent after the law decriminalizing possession of small amounts of the drug . “ We don ’ t need Portugal , ” says Humphreys . “ We , in the United States , have done these things . I think we could probably start moving on to what happened in California . ”
“ There was no evidence of substitution effect , either , ” he adds . “ Some people worry that the police will just find another reason to arrest the same person — you know , get you for jaywalking or whatever . But that doesn ’ t seem to have been the case . ”
“ There ’ s police time involved in making those arrests , ” Humphreys says . “ If you ’ re going to cut the police force or defund them more , this might be a way to do it without doing any real damage to public health . At least for cannabis , people may use it a little more , but it doesn ’ t seem to be they use a lot more than that . I think a lot of people would see that as a reasonable trade . ”
Crucially , Humphreys also argues that investing in health responses to drug abuse indirectly lowers interaction with the police , as users who successfully undergo treatment decrease the criminal and antisocial behaviors affiliated with narcotic use and trade .
Here , again , the case for defunding the police rests on the concept that it is more effective and efficient to shift responsibility away from officers and departments to civil service and care workers specifically trained to handle medical and logistical problems . Repeating this policy thought experiment across mental health , domestic counseling , homelessness , and more , defunders outline the playbook to move away from policing .
Many of these advocates still see a role for police officers , albeit a significantly diminished one . They view officers as a last resort , reserved for the most serious crimes , and for true emergencies as opposed to the roles they currently serve as default first responders . In this way , they differ from the abolitionists .
In interviews , advocates of defunding the police speak very favorably of abolitionists , and vice versa . In fact , in the short term , there is virtually no policy difference between many defunders and abolitionists . This symmetry can be seen in the recent vote by the Seattle City Council to cut the city ’ s Police Department by 50 percent and reroute that money to social programs . This policy action , led in part by non-abolitionists elected officials , mirrors the policy recommendation of Mariame Kaba , the prison industrial complex abolitionist who recommended a 50 percent defund this summer in the New York Times .
That said , the long-term difference between those who want to defund and those who want to abolish is that the former believe police to be necessary in the case of true violence and extreme emergencies . Abolitionists don ’ t ; they ultimately call for alternative interventions , even for violent crimes .
In addition to all the critiques levied by defunders , abolitionists contend that the police remain an inherently racist institution , with its legacy stretching back to slave patrols , a history of supporting white supremacy groups like the Ku Klux Klan , and contemporary patterns of the racialized brutality on Black , brown , Indigenous , and vulnerable communities .
Abolitionists describe ending the police as an integral part of America ’ s “ third Reconstruction , ” where in addition to full citizenship and economic rights , Black people and all people will be free of wanton state violence at the hands of the police .
Police and prison abolition can be traced in the modern context to radical Black feminist and anti-capitalist thinkers like Angela Davis . In her 2003 book Are Prisons Obsolete ? , Davis pushed readers to question their acceptance of the carceral state , principally prisons , in American life .
“ In most circles prison abolition is simply unthinkable and implausible . Prison abolitionists are dismissed as utopians and idealists whose ideas are at best unrealistic and impracticable , and , at worst , mystifying and foolish , ” she wrote .
“ This is a measure of how difficult it is to envision a social order that does not rely on the threat of sequestering people in dreadful places designed to separate them from their communities and families , ” she continued . “ The prison is considered so ‘ natural ’ that it is extremely hard to imagine life without it . ”
The same goes for police . Abolitionists envision ending both police and prisons as the next critical chapter in the Black freedom struggle following up on the end of slavery and Jim Crow . They believe that much of the crime that police officers respond to reflects broader conditions , disinvestments , and oppressions present across society , which are then used as justification for the policing and carceral states . Police , in this telling , mask deep societal sins , and only by removing them can we see the real work and transformation needed .
In the Boston Review , attorney and activist Derecka Purnell outlines what the road to police abolition might mean in broad strokes :
Police abolition could mean and require society to decrease and eliminate its reliance on policing . Rather than re-center police as a public good , the nation must become good and public . The prison–industrial complex must be dissolved . Communities must rebuild labor organizing to shift capital , and the state must drastically disrupt rising wealth inequality . Congress may have to pass laws around prison labor , voting rights , gun ownership , and campaign finance , and decriminalize thousands of behaviors . Social workers and activists must work with communities to find solutions for patriarchal , homophobic , and mental health–based violence . Police abolition advocates and scholars have robust visions for the future beyond transformation .
The vision is sweeping . Foundational to police abolition is what Purnell describes as eliminating “ reliance on policing. ” Kaba describes this idea as wanting not merely to “ close police departments ” but “ to make them obsolete. ” This is abolition as innovation . It is social engineering calling for a bold public policy action to address chronic social and economic issues and provide for basic human needs .
In this view , the primary aim centers on preventing criminogenic preconditions ( joblessness , underinsurance , etc . ) that lead to the violence for which people rely on the police . To the degree that violent crime persists even during and after these policies take effect , activists favor what they described as non-carceral interventions .
The Breathe Act , introduced by Reps. Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley , promotes programs that view violent crime as akin to a public health problem , requiring public health-style responses . Violence , in this view , spreads like a virus , and successful violence interruption programs rapidly deescalate neighborhood tensions following a shooting to stop the further transmission of violent retaliation . A recent memo from Data for Progress outlines the successful pilot programs using violence interruption to curb shootings in the neighborhoods with the highest levels of gun violence .
Repeated evaluations of Cure Violence have shown that it significantly reduces violence . In West Chicago ’ s West Garfield Park , the program reduced shootings by 67 % in its first year . A NIJ/ Northwestern University evaluation found that Cure Violence reduced shootings across Chicago by 41 % to 73 % . Other studies have also found that Cure Violence reduced shootings in cities like New York and Philadelphia .
Similarly , a 2017 UCLA analysis on violence interruption described the program as an effective way to curb violence by “ tasking civilian community interventions workers to mediate conflict and control rumors following a reported gang crime . ”
“ Our analyses of quasi-experimental interventions in Los Angeles indicates that civilian Community Intervention Workers , tasked by the Gang Reduction Youth Development program , cut gang retaliations by 45.3 % , independently of the effects of policing , ” the authors wrote .
The Breathe Act leans on such non-policing alternatives to transition away from police solutions to crime . It also calls to expand Medicaid , implement a living wage , create targeted job programs for the long-term unemployed , and other economic justice initiatives .
“ You can tell a lot about a country based on how it allocates its resources . We ’ re saying that now is a time when we target budget , local and federal — where we say , divest from these institutions that have been harming us and invest in what our communities have always needed and will continue to need , ” says Thenjiwe McHarris , the abolitionist and Movement for Black Lives activist . “ We actually want to have access to safety . And what that means for us is a divestment from policing , and the institution of policing and an investment in what our communities need : quality housing , quality education , health services , particularly in the midst of a pandemic . ”
While abolitionists like McHarris have radical political aspirations , they remain committed to translating that vision into more immediate policy . Beyond the Breathe Act , abolition goals articulated in the Movement for Black Lives platform and in the more recent 8 to Abolition campaign outline first steps municipalities can take toward reducing , and eventually ending , the need for police .
Critics of police abolition remain skeptical about these activists ’ ability to create alternative forms of care and emergency response to address violent crime .

A terrified white woman jolts awake at 2 am during a home invasion. She alerts her husband. She grabs her phone. She calls the police. But it’s too late. They have all been defunded. A dispatcher informs her that a “human resources” specialist can’t help her right now as the camera pans over her sleeping child, the burglar advancing ominously. “Radical liberals are fighting for a police-free future,” the narrator intones. “Don’t let them put your family in danger.”

There is one thing — and only one thing — the ad gets right: On all sides, in all directions, the debate over the future of policing remains a debate over safety, driven by communities who desperately, deeply want to feel safe.

In the aftermath of George Floyd’s killing at the hands of police, virtually every faction in American politics — from Trump Republicans to Biden Democrats, from Cato libertarians to intersectional Marxists — says they want to change policing.

On one end of the spectrum stand abolitionists, who want to “delegitimize the police.” These activists demand an entirely new public safety system based on social and economic equity, bolstered by a network of nonviolent emergency responders. They are offering more than a different vision for public safety — they are offering a different vision for the composition, and fundamental assumptions, of society. They have a different view of what causes crime. In the world they imagine, America would spend much more on education, health care, and infrastructure, and nothing on police departments as we currently know them.

On the other end stand reformers, who want to “restore legitimacy to the police.” This group seeks to implement procedural reforms to make officers more accountable and effective. They also, in general, want to spend more on policing. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s plan, for instance, spends more on education and health care and infrastructure, but also more on policing: He’s proposed a $300 million increase to the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program.

Countless opinions dot the range between — in particular, the “defund the police” movement (more on that in a moment). Much of the debate remains contentious, particularly on how best to defeat violent crime. Yet even amid consternation, bad faith, polarization, disagreement, and partisanship, a common refrain cuts across the parties: America relies too heavily on the police for unrelated services.

“We need alternatives to policing,” says Thenjiwe McHarris, an activist in the Movement for Black Lives and a police abolitionist. “If someone is sleeping on a bench, if there’s a mental health issue, policing is the one tactic⁠ — often a failed tactic⁠ — used in our communities for the range of needs our people have.”

“The reality is we have turned to police to handle a lot of problems in society that nobody else wanted to do⁠ — to handle issues around substance abuse, to handle issues around the homeless, to handle issues around mental health,” says Laurie Robinson, who chaired President Obama’s Task Force on 21st Century Policing, which produced the basic agenda of the police reform movement. “I think they would be very happy to hand off these responsibilities.”

Likewise, former NYPD sergeant and Burlington Police Chief Brandon del Pozo asked: “Why are we still asking the police as untrained interventionists to deal with people who are overdosing and using drugs or as barely trained crisis interventionists to deal with mental health when we can piggyback or create separate apparatuses that handle that for us?”

This cross-coalitional interest in reassigning nonviolent services presents the most promising opportunity for ambitious change to a country rollicked by weeks, and years, of protest against racist policing. In an opening bid, abolitionists have suggested rerouting 50 percent of police budgets to other civil services.

But understanding the areas for compromise also requires seeing where the different visions conflict. So let’s go through them in turn.

Reforming the police

The police reform movement stands atop two premises. Good policing is good. Reams of research show it does, in fact, reduce violent crime. But bad policing is bad. It’s bad on its own terms, because it harms the people it brutalizes, and it’s bad because it delegitimizes the police in the eyes of the community they’re meant to serve.

In Milwaukee, for instance, an important study showed that 911 calls fell after a publicized case of police brutality. The harm of bad policing, in other words, was both the police brutality and the severing of the relationship between the community and the public agency meant to keep them safe.

Police reformers, then, are trying to do two things at the same time: Make sure there are enough police to keep violent crime low, and make sure those police are both well-trained enough and tightly constrained enough not to abuse their power.

The Obama administration’s Task Force on 21st Century Policing formed just after the 2014 uprising in Ferguson, Missouri, and published its report immediately after the 2015 Baltimore uprising. Its policy goals were a shift in policing culture, use of force, transparency, and fairness. As with universal pre-K, a $15 minimum wage, free community college, and a federal jobs program, the report articulated a progressive vision that was never fully achieved. Yet today, as establishment politicians respond to protesters’ calls for change, the task force’s report still offers a window into how traditional reformers imagine a new American policing paradigm.

“The reality is we have turned to police to handle a lot of problems in society that nobody else wanted to do⁠ — to handle issues around substance abuse, to handle issues around the homeless, to handle issues around mental health”

Among the report’s 59 recommendations were that officers “acknowledge the role of policing in past and present injustice and discrimination”; avoid violence against “children, elderly persons, pregnant women, people with physical and mental disabilities, limited English proficiency, and others”; and “adopt and enforce policies prohibiting profiling and discrimination based on race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, age, gender, gender identity/expression, sexual orientation, immigration status, disability, housing status, occupation, or language fluency.”

The task force envisioned officers who are friendly, mentally well-adjusted, highly trained “guardians.” Through incentives, curriculums, and hiring programs, departments would create officers who prioritize deescalation and nonviolent intervention, abide by strict anti-discrimination laws, operate under strong transparency protocols, and stand accountable to local civilians.

Under this plan, police are not abolished; they are enlightened.

The authors also call for expanding the use of social workers and other nonviolent crisis specialists to supplement police officers. The report recommends reducing crime “through a variety of programs that focus on public health, education, mental health, and other programs not traditionally part of the criminal justice system.” This broader response to crime represents an area of overlap with the more progressive protests demanding alternatives to policing.

Robinson, the co-chair of the task force, says the ethos of the document has entered into the bloodstream of American policing. Citing a survey of 47 of the largest law enforcement agencies in the United States from 2015 to 2017 conducted by the Major Cities Chiefs Association (MCCA) and the National Police Foundation, Robinson notes that 39 percent of the departments updated their use of force policies and incorporated deescalation training. The survey also reported that officer-involved shootings during this period dropped by 21 percent.

While these data points highlight good news, Robinson also underscores that administrative barriers prevented the policy recommendations from becoming universal policing standards across the country.

“We have a highly decentralized system,” she says. “We have 18,000 separate and very independent state and local law enforcement agencies that are operated and run by, in our case, many local independent mayors and city managers who are responsible for operating and overseeing those local departments.” This fragmented bureaucracy clashing and the strength of police unions makes even the more modest reforms suggested in the policing task force more difficult to enact. But Robinson — and Obama — remains optimistic that the report’s recommendations remain the right path forward.

“We know there are specific evidence-based reforms that if we put [them] in place today would build trust, save lives, would not show an increase in crime,” Obama said in a statement following George Floyd’s death. “Those are included in the 21st-Century Policing Task Force report.”

Thomas Abt, another Obama administration alum and author of Bleeding Out, a book on policing urban violence, said in principle he supports conversations around what roles police served and how they might be scaled back. Yet he remains worried about the tenor of the current defunding conversation.

“I am supportive of asking these big questions about whether we can start winnowing down the police role. But you don’t do that by just slashing police budgets, without a broader conversation about who’s going to step up and fill the gap,” Abt says.

“I worry that people don’t understand what it takes to set up a first responder operation. It took us well over a century to put together police, fire, EMT,” he continues. “To have a government service capable of responding in real time to these things is an enormous undertaking.”

Abt and other more traditional reformers continued to see a central role for American police in society. Abt supports a mix of police reforms to increase transparency and curtail the use of force while also deploying surges of concentrated policing in the most violent neighborhoods.

But to the defunders and abolitionists, reform has been tried, and it has been found wanting. This year, the police department in Tucson, Arizona, was noted as “progressive” and “reform-minded” and had “banned chokeholds and shooting at moving vehicles, embracing a range of measures aimed at reducing police violence,” according to the New York Times. Yet local officers still killed Carlos Ingram-Lopez, a Latino man who was reportedly naked and experiencing a mental health crisis when he was killed, and withheld the video for months. Likewise, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, which was celebrated for its progressive mayor, a former civil rights attorney, and their reform-minded police chief, city employees still killed George Floyd.

Citing reform failures, many activists want to go further.

What it means to “defund the police”

Last month, the Washington Post published an article that cautioned that after a recession budget crunch, Vallejo, California, “defunded its police department” and officer killings shot up, while crime enforcement plummeted. “Vallejo’s experience offers a glimpse of what a reduced police presence on America’s streets could mean as defunding continues to gain traction,” the piece warned.

But austerity-driven disinvestment is not the future defunders want. (It also does not accurately represent the public policy vision that defund advocates are fighting for, as the Washington Post later clarified in the article.)

“Part of the push here is that we know what we want to defund — the other part about the demands for what we need,” says defund advocate and Illinois state Sen. Robert Peters (D). “Folks often get caught up in this ‘oh, my god’ of demanding to defund the police. People need to know there’s a whole host of other demands attached to that, which are about uplifting community.”

In essence, defunding exists as a suite of public policy ideas premised on investments in individual well-being, community infrastructure, alternative first responder services, and divestment from the use of lethal force.

Defunders don’t just emphasize expanding social programs and investments but also removing money from police departments. They argue that the swelling police budgets fuel violence and corruption.

Advocates like the Center for Popular Democracy’s Kumar Rao argue that police departments run on a broken financial feedback loop where, after poorly policing communities of color and running up huge legal fees for abuse, torture, and unjust killings, departments are rewarded with larger budgets the next year, funding a cycle of violence.

“Part of the problem here is the amount of money that has gone toward policing over the last several decades,” says Rao. “We’re now reaching a point where we spend over $100 billion every year on policing. That kind of spending on policing has entrenched an institution and has made it ultimately unaccountable.”

For Rao, increasing police budgets increases the number of officers, which increases the scope of officers’ duties, which increases officers’ interactions with civilians, which increases opportunities for police violence.

Beyond issues of corruption, defunders also argue that reliance on police departments is poor execution of public policy because police specialize in violent crime, but violent crime only represents a small portion of the sprawling civil services they perform. They believe the money could be used more effectively elsewhere.

Take traffic, for example, where police spend nearly 20 percent of their time working in some cities. Experts like Transportation Alternatives deputy director Marco Conner DiAquoi argue that it is both safer and more efficient for cities to manage traffic through transportation infrastructure investments, automated enforcement, and specialized civilian first responders rather than through police.

“Police officer-based enforcement is less effective than infrastructural alternatives, like street redesigns and automated enforcement, and puts people of color at risk,” DiAquoi and co-authors write in “The Case for Self-Enforcing Streets.” The report, published in June by Transportation Alternatives, seeks to remedy the ways in which enforcement of traffic laws leads to discretionary and often biased policing of minorities.

In New York City, DiAquoi argues, many of the violations that are cited in minority neighborhoods are the natural upshot of poor infrastructure in segregated communities — elements like a bike lane, quality sidewalks, or well-designed streets. DiAquoi and the other co-authors make a case for reallocating “significant portions” of the NYPD’s budget to the Department of Transportation to “increase investments in street design and automated enforcement to create ‘self-enforcing’ streets” which would “reduce the ability of police officers to violate civil rights, cause property damage, or otherwise participate in sueable offenses.”

Decriminalization illuminates another part of the vision behind defunding. Defunders — like many others — believe the war on drugs has been racist and ineffective, and we should simply end it. And if we end it, it makes sense for police budgets, which have grown in part because of the drug war, to be cut.

In Alex Vitale’s The End of Policing, the Brooklyn College sociologist explains how Portugal successfully decriminalized drug use in 1999; it handed over drug harm reduction to health officials, reaping “very favorable” results, with most drug use “now treated as a health problem.”

“Studies have found significant reductions in heroin addiction, overdoses, and disease transmission,” Vitale writes of the country. “In 1999, Portugal had the highest rate of HIV infection among injecting drug users in the European Union; by 2009, the number of newly diagnosed HIV cases among drug users had decreased substantially.” Likewise, reporting on Portugal’s decriminalization of drugs for the New York Times, journalist Nicholas Kristof found “the number of heroin users there fell by three-quarters, and the overdose fatality rate was the lowest in Western Europe.”

“Meanwhile, after decades of policing, the United States was losing about 70,000 Americans a year from overdoses,” Kristof continued. “In effect, Portugal appeared to be winning the war on drugs by ending it.”

Even scholars like Stanford University’s Keith Humphreys, who has been skeptical of the methodology used in the Portugal research, note that similar results can be seen in the United States. Citing data from the Criminal Justice Statistics Center, Humphreys notes that after California lawmakers decriminalized marijuana, the state saw decreased interaction with the police. According to the study, marijuana possession arrests in California dropped by 86 percent after the law decriminalizing possession of small amounts of the drug. “We don’t need Portugal,” says Humphreys. “We, in the United States, have done these things. I think we could probably start moving on to what happened in California.”

“There was no evidence of substitution effect, either,” he adds. “Some people worry that the police will just find another reason to arrest the same person — you know, get you for jaywalking or whatever. But that doesn’t seem to have been the case.”

“There’s police time involved in making those arrests,” Humphreys says. “If you’re going to cut the police force or defund them more, this might be a way to do it without doing any real damage to public health. At least for cannabis, people may use it a little more, but it doesn’t seem to be they use a lot more than that. I think a lot of people would see that as a reasonable trade.”

Crucially, Humphreys also argues that investing in health responses to drug abuse indirectly lowers interaction with the police, as users who successfully undergo treatment decrease the criminal and antisocial behaviors affiliated with narcotic use and trade.

Here, again, the case for defunding the police rests on the concept that it is more effective and efficient to shift responsibility away from officers and departments to civil service and care workers specifically trained to handle medical and logistical problems. Repeating this policy thought experiment across mental health, domestic counseling, homelessness, and more, defunders outline the playbook to move away from policing.

Many of these advocates still see a role for police officers, albeit a significantly diminished one. They view officers as a last resort, reserved for the most serious crimes, and for true emergencies as opposed to the roles they currently serve as default first responders. In this way, they differ from the abolitionists.

The abolitionist vision

In interviews, advocates of defunding the police speak very favorably of abolitionists, and vice versa. In fact, in the short term, there is virtually no policy difference between many defunders and abolitionists. This symmetry can be seen in the recent vote by the Seattle City Council to cut the city’s Police Department by 50 percent and reroute that money to social programs. This policy action, led in part by non-abolitionists elected officials, mirrors the policy recommendation of Mariame Kaba, the prison industrial complex abolitionist who recommended a 50 percent defund this summer in the New York Times.

That said, the long-term difference between those who want to defund and those who want to abolish is that the former believe police to be necessary in the case of true violence and extreme emergencies. Abolitionists don’t; they ultimately call for alternative interventions, even for violent crimes.

In addition to all the critiques levied by defunders, abolitionists contend that the police remain an inherently racist institution, with its legacy stretching back to slave patrols, a history of supporting white supremacy groups like the Ku Klux Klan, and contemporary patterns of the racialized brutality on Black, brown, Indigenous, and vulnerable communities.

Abolitionists describe ending the police as an integral part of America’s “third Reconstruction,” where in addition to full citizenship and economic rights, Black people and all people will be free of wanton state violence at the hands of the police.

Police and prison abolition can be traced in the modern context to radical Black feminist and anti-capitalist thinkers like Angela Davis. In her 2003 book Are Prisons Obsolete?, Davis pushed readers to question their acceptance of the carceral state, principally prisons, in American life.

“In most circles prison abolition is simply unthinkable and implausible. Prison abolitionists are dismissed as utopians and idealists whose ideas are at best unrealistic and impracticable, and, at worst, mystifying and foolish,” she wrote.

“This is a measure of how difficult it is to envision a social order that does not rely on the threat of sequestering people in dreadful places designed to separate them from their communities and families,” she continued. “The prison is considered so ‘natural’ that it is extremely hard to imagine life without it.”

The same goes for police. Abolitionists envision ending both police and prisons as the next critical chapter in the Black freedom struggle following up on the end of slavery and Jim Crow. They believe that much of the crime that police officers respond to reflects broader conditions, disinvestments, and oppressions present across society, which are then used as justification for the policing and carceral states. Police, in this telling, mask deep societal sins, and only by removing them can we see the real work and transformation needed.

In the Boston Review, attorney and activist Derecka Purnell outlines what the road to police abolition might mean in broad strokes:

Police abolition could mean and require society to decrease and eliminate its reliance on policing. Rather than re-center police as a public good, the nation must become good and public. The prison–industrial complex must be dissolved. Communities must rebuild labor organizing to shift capital, and the state must drastically disrupt rising wealth inequality. Congress may have to pass laws around prison labor, voting rights, gun ownership, and campaign finance, and decriminalize thousands of behaviors. Social workers and activists must work with communities to find solutions for patriarchal, homophobic, and mental health–based violence. Police abolition advocates and scholars have robust visions for the future beyond transformation.

The vision is sweeping. Foundational to police abolition is what Purnell describes as eliminating “reliance on policing.” Kaba describes this idea as wanting not merely to “close police departments” but “to make them obsolete.” This is abolition as innovation. It is social engineering calling for a bold public policy action to address chronic social and economic issues and provide for basic human needs.

In this view, the primary aim centers on preventing criminogenic preconditions (joblessness, underinsurance, etc.) that lead to the violence for which people rely on the police. To the degree that violent crime persists even during and after these policies take effect, activists favor what they described as non-carceral interventions.

The Breathe Act, introduced by Reps. Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley, promotes programs that view violent crime as akin to a public health problem, requiring public health-style responses. Violence, in this view, spreads like a virus, and successful violence interruption programs rapidly deescalate neighborhood tensions following a shooting to stop the further transmission of violent retaliation. A recent memo from Data for Progress outlines the successful pilot programs using violence interruption to curb shootings in the neighborhoods with the highest levels of gun violence.

It summarized:

Repeated evaluations of Cure Violence have shown that it significantly reduces violence. In West Chicago’s West Garfield Park, the program reduced shootings by 67% in its first year. A NIJ/ Northwestern University evaluation found that Cure Violence reduced shootings across Chicago by 41% to 73%. Other studies have also found that Cure Violence reduced shootings in cities like New York and Philadelphia.

Similarly, a 2017 UCLA analysis on violence interruption described the program as an effective way to curb violence by “tasking civilian community interventions workers to mediate conflict and control rumors following a reported gang crime.”

“Our analyses of quasi-experimental interventions in Los Angeles indicates that civilian Community Intervention Workers, tasked by the Gang Reduction Youth Development program, cut gang retaliations by 45.3%, independently of the effects of policing,” the authors wrote.

The Breathe Act leans on such non-policing alternatives to transition away from police solutions to crime. It also calls to expand Medicaid, implement a living wage, create targeted job programs for the long-term unemployed, and other economic justice initiatives.

“You can tell a lot about a country based on how it allocates its resources. We’re saying that now is a time when we target budget, local and federal — where we say, divest from these institutions that have been harming us and invest in what our communities have always needed and will continue to need,” says Thenjiwe McHarris, the abolitionist and Movement for Black Lives activist. “We actually want to have access to safety. And what that means for us is a divestment from policing, and the institution of policing and an investment in what our communities need: quality housing, quality education, health services, particularly in the midst of a pandemic.”

While abolitionists like McHarris have radical political aspirations, they remain committed to translating that vision into more immediate policy. Beyond the Breathe Act, abolition goals articulated in the Movement for Black Lives platform and in the more recent 8 to Abolition campaign outline first steps municipalities can take toward reducing, and eventually ending, the need for police.

Critics of police abolition remain skeptical about these activists’ ability to create alternative forms of care and emergency response to address violent crime. These traditional policymakers fear reducing the police force will result in spiking neighborhood violence. Since clearance rates and crime reporting in low-income communities of color remain abysmally low, abolition advocates often embrace a new policy framework.

Activists view the abolish mission as part of a multigenerational Black freedom struggle, and a radical tradition. “It’s a marathon, it’s not a sprint. We’re inside of a particular opening. It was decades to get us here. We’re all inside of multi-decade strategies,” says McHarris.

Defunding non-criminal services⁠ — much of police work⁠ — appears promising

Sharp, and even seemingly irreconcilable, differences exist in the competing visions of reform, defunding, and abolition. Yet the shortcomings of the American police system — and American public policy more broadly — stretch so wide that it creates a significant zone of overlap. Policing fails to address much of American inequality, dysfunction, and civil disorder. We have asked them to do too much, and we have neglected the investments and institutions that would make their presence less necessary.

More than half of police work addresses non-criminal issues according to an analysis of public records by the New York Times and an observational study in Criminal Justice Review. Likewise, policing scholars like NYU Law’s Barry Friedman argue that “crimefighting actually is a very small part of what police do every day.”

Moreover, officers themselves often question the utility of using police for issues like mental health and homelessness. “I’m not even saying now that the budgets shouldn’t be looked at, and seeing if there’s another way to do that,” Vince Champion of the International Brotherhood of Police Officers said on a recent episode of The Daily. “Look, a lot of officers, we’re social workers. We’re marriage counselors. We’re doctors sometimes. We’re more than actually what we were trained to be. I mean, we try to train for everything that we can, but we just can’t be.”

Then-President Barack Obama echoed a similar sentiment in his 2016 Dallas police speech, when he castigated America for underinvesting in schools, allowing poverty, underfunding drug treatment and mental health programs, not regulating guns, and then telling the police “you’re a social worker; you’re the parent; you’re the teacher; you’re the drug counselor.”

Converting common sense into consensus policy remains a daunting task for a country ailed by overlapping health and economic crises and diminishing political capacity.

This is a difficult debate on its own terms, happening at many levels simultaneously. Racial justice activists seek to address the problem at the scale at which it exists — that is, on the scale of multigenerational theft, divestment, and discrimination. For many, this is too daunting to contemplate and too complicated to legislate. But it doesn’t make it any less necessary.

At a press conference with Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats Daniel ( Dan ) Ray CoatsThis week : Democrats churn toward next phase of impeachment fight 281 lobbyists have worked in Trump administration : report Former intelligence chief Coats rejoins law firm MORE , Sessions announced that the Justice Department , FBI and government intelligence agencies will direct more resources into the investigations of government leaks and would prioritize prosecuting those that pass sensitive information along to the press or foreign officials .
Sessions said he had empowered his deputy director Rod Rosenstein and incoming FBI director Christopher Wray to oversee the classified leaks investigations and to monitor the progress of each case .
The national security division of the Justice Department will prioritize cases involving unauthorized disclosures , Sessions said , and the departments “ will not hesitate to bring lawful and appropriate criminal charges against those who abuse the public trust . ”
Sessions said his Justice Department has already tripled the number of active leak investigations over the previous administration , and that the FBI would create a new counterintelligence unit to manage the cases .
In addition , Sessions said that after meeting with FBI and intelligence investigators , the Justice Department would review its policies affecting media subpoenas .
“ We respect the important role the press plays and we ’ ll give them respect , but it ’ s not unlimited , ” Sessions said . “ They can not place lives at risk with impunity . We must balance the press ’ role with protecting our national security and the lives of those who serve in the intelligence community , the Armed Forces and all law-abiding Americans . ”
President Trump has been pushing Sessions to be more aggressive in prosecuting illegal government leaks , which have bedeviled the administration from the start .
There have been a torrent of government leaks since Trump took office , leading to accusations from the right that rogue “ deep state ” actors are conducting a silent “ coup ” against the president .
Sessions said there had been “ dramatic growth ” in the number of unauthorized disclosures since Trump had taken office and that his office had seen an “ explosion ” of referrals for potential investigations .
The attorney general would not give details about specific investigations , but said four individuals had already been charged with the unlawful release of sensitive government information .
“ I have this message for our friends in the intelligence community : The Justice Department is open for business , ” Sessions said . “ And I have this warning for potential leakers : Don ’ t do it . ”
Coats , the director of national intelligence , sent a direct message to leakers , would-be leakers and the media outlets that have printed sensitive information .
“ If you improperly disclose classified information , we will find you , we will investigate you and we will prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law , ” Coats said . “ You will not be happy with the result . ”
The details of the myriad probes into Russian meddling in the 2016 election , currently underway in the House , Senate , at the FBI and through the special counsel , have consistently found their way into the press through anonymous sources .
The flow of leaks has frustrated the White House , which has been dealing with the cloud of investigation since before the president ’ s inauguration .
Coats noted that not all of the leaks originate from the intelligence community , saying that they also come from the Executive Branch and Congress and that his office would not discriminate in its pursuit of those that break the law .
“ Any disclosure outside of authorized channels is a criminal offense and we will simply not tolerate the illegal release of classified information , ” Coats said .
Some of the leaked stories have proven to be untrue , giving the Trump administration political ammunition in its attacks against the press . Many of the stories have been attributed to former administration officials , which has raised suspicions on the right that they are coming from holdovers from former President Obama ’ s government .
Earlier this year , Trump fired his national security adviser Michael Flynn after his name was unmasked in a surveillance report that detailed his conversation with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak .
Trump ’ s feud with former FBI director James Comey also spilled into the press after Comey passed personal memos detailing his encounters with Trump along to a friend .
Comey later testified that he orchestrated the leaks to ensure that a special investigator was put in charge of the Russia investigation . In the eyes of many on the right , those actions have tainted special counselor Robert Mueller ’ s investigation into Russian election meddling .
And details of Trump ’ s Oval Office conversations with world leaders have also made their way into the press .
That came to a head this week when the full transcripts of Trump ’ s phone calls with foreign leaders were leaked to The Washington Post .

Sessions said he had empowered his deputy director Rod Rosenstein and incoming FBI director Christopher Wray to oversee the classified leaks investigations and to monitor the progress of each case.

The national security division of the Justice Department will prioritize cases involving unauthorized disclosures, Sessions said, and the departments “will not hesitate to bring lawful and appropriate criminal charges against those who abuse the public trust.”

Sessions said his Justice Department has already tripled the number of active leak investigations over the previous administration, and that the FBI would create a new counterintelligence unit to manage the cases.

In addition, Sessions said that after meeting with FBI and intelligence investigators, the Justice Department would review its policies affecting media subpoenas.

“We respect the important role the press plays and we’ll give them respect, but it’s not unlimited,” Sessions said. “They cannot place lives at risk with impunity. We must balance the press’ role with protecting our national security and the lives of those who serve in the intelligence community, the Armed Forces and all law-abiding Americans.”

President Trump has been pushing Sessions to be more aggressive in prosecuting illegal government leaks, which have bedeviled the administration from the start.

There have been a torrent of government leaks since Trump took office, leading to accusations from the right that rogue “deep state” actors are conducting a silent “coup” against the president.

Sessions said there had been “dramatic growth” in the number of unauthorized disclosures since Trump had taken office and that his office had seen an “explosion” of referrals for potential investigations.

The attorney general would not give details about specific investigations, but said four individuals had already been charged with the unlawful release of sensitive government information.

“I have this message for our friends in the intelligence community: The Justice Department is open for business,” Sessions said. “And I have this warning for potential leakers: Don’t do it.”

Coats, the director of national intelligence, sent a direct message to leakers, would-be leakers and the media outlets that have printed sensitive information.

“If you improperly disclose classified information, we will find you, we will investigate you and we will prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law,” Coats said. “You will not be happy with the result.”

The details of the myriad probes into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, currently underway in the House, Senate, at the FBI and through the special counsel, have consistently found their way into the press through anonymous sources.

The flow of leaks has frustrated the White House, which has been dealing with the cloud of investigation since before the president’s inauguration.

Coats noted that not all of the leaks originate from the intelligence community, saying that they also come from the Executive Branch and Congress and that his office would not discriminate in its pursuit of those that break the law.

“Any disclosure outside of authorized channels is a criminal offense and we will simply not tolerate the illegal release of classified information,” Coats said.

Some of the leaked stories have proven to be untrue, giving the Trump administration political ammunition in its attacks against the press. Many of the stories have been attributed to former administration officials, which has raised suspicions on the right that they are coming from holdovers from former President Obama’s government.

Earlier this year, Trump fired his national security adviser Michael Flynn after his name was unmasked in a surveillance report that detailed his conversation with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak.

Trump’s feud with former FBI director James Comey also spilled into the press after Comey passed personal memos detailing his encounters with Trump along to a friend.

Comey later testified that he orchestrated the leaks to ensure that a special investigator was put in charge of the Russia investigation. In the eyes of many on the right, those actions have tainted special counselor Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian election meddling.

And details of Trump’s Oval Office conversations with world leaders have also made their way into the press.

That came to a head this week when the full transcripts of Trump’s phone calls with foreign leaders were leaked to The Washington Post.

Many in the media and on the left have celebrated the leaks, which have consistently embarrassed the president or caused new political problems for him.

But the printed Oval Office transcripts went too far for some Democrats, who warned that the release of the president’s private conversations with foreign leaders undermines national security.

justice,Fox Online News,2,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/11/18/alabama-senator-sessions-offered-attorney-general-post-in-trump-administration.html,Alabama senator Sessions offered attorney general post in Trump administration,2016-11-18,,"President-elect Donald Trump on Friday announced his first two Cabinet picks : Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions as attorney general and Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo as CIA director .
Trump also confirmed that he called on retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn to be his national security adviser .
Sessions , Pompeo and Flynn have all been outspoken critics of President Obama and how his administration has handled terrorism and national security .
In picking Sessions and Flynn , Trump is rewarding two loyalists who were among his most ardent supporters during the presidential campaign .
Trump praised all three men in a lengthy written statement , calling Sessions “ a world-class legal mind ” who is “ greatly admired by legal scholars and virtually everyone who knows him . ”
Sessions , who accepted Trump ’ s offer and awaits confirmation hearings by the Senate , said he looks forward to fulfilling his duties “ with an unwavering dedication to fairness and impartiality . ”
Trump said Pompeo “ will be a brilliant and unrelenting leader for our intelligence community to ensure the safety of Americans and our allies . ”
He said Flynn , a retired Army lieutenant general and former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency , “ will be by my side as we work to defeat radical Islamic terrorism , navigate geopolitical challenges and keep Americans safe at home and abroad . ”
Trump is a foreign policy novice , and his early moves on national security are being closely watched both domestically and globally .
Like Sessions , Pompeo will need to be confirmed by the Senate before assuming the role . Flynn does not require confirmation .
Even though Republicans control the Senate , Sessions could face obstacles with his confirmation .
He withdrew from consideration for a federal judgeship in 1986 after being accused of making racist comments while serving as a U.S. attorney in Alabama .
Sessions , the first senator to endorse Trump , has been a leading proponent of tough immigration enforcement policies . He 's tangled with the past two Democratic-appointed attorneys general on whether terrorism suspects deserve the protections of American civilian courts and on the planned closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility . He 's also been protective of the attorney general 's right to refuse a legally unsound directive from the president .
Pompeo is a conservative Republican and a strong critic of Obama 's nuclear deal with Iran . A three-term congressman , he graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point and from Harvard Law School .
Pompeo has said that Muslim leaders are `` potentially complicit '' in terrorist attacks if they do not denounce those made in the name of Islam .
`` They must cite the Koran as evidence that the murder of innocents is not permitted , '' he said in a 2013 House floor speech .
Flynn was a critic of Obama 's military and foreign policy long before he began advising Trump on national security issues during the presidential campaign . As national security adviser , Flynn would work in the West Wing and have frequent access to Trump .
The 57-year-old has been outspoken in his warnings about the dangers of Islamist groups , saying the U.S. needs to `` discredit '' radical Islam . He 's called Islam a `` political ideology '' and said it `` definitely hides behind being a religion . ''
Flynn has also worried some national security experts with his warmth toward Russia . Like Trump , he 's called for the U.S. to work more closely with Moscow .
Last year , Flynn traveled to Moscow to join Russian President Vladimir Putin at a celebration for RT , a television channel funded by the Russian government . Flynn said he had been paid for taking part in the event , but brushed aside concerns that he was aiding a Russian propaganda effort .
Trump has made no public appearances this week , but his meetings have signaled a focus on national security . He met Thursday with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe , his first face-to-face meeting with a foreign leader since winning the election Nov. 8 .
He also consulted with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and sat down with South Carolina Gov . Nikki Haley , a potential contender to lead the State Department .
In a separate gesture of reconciliation with establishment Republicans , Trump plans to meet on Saturday with 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney , who lambasted Trump as a `` con man '' and a `` fraud '' in a stinging speech in March .

Jeff Sessions as attorney general and Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo as CIA director.

Trump also confirmed that he called on retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn to be his national security adviser.

Sessions, Pompeo and Flynn have all been outspoken critics of President Obama and how his administration has handled terrorism and national security.

In picking Sessions and Flynn, Trump is rewarding two loyalists who were among his most ardent supporters during the presidential campaign.

Trump praised all three men in a lengthy written statement, calling Sessions “a world-class legal mind” who is “greatly admired by legal scholars and virtually everyone who knows him.”

Sessions, who accepted Trump’s offer and awaits confirmation hearings by the Senate, said he looks forward to fulfilling his duties “with an unwavering dedication to fairness and impartiality.”

Trump said Pompeo “will be a brilliant and unrelenting leader for our intelligence community to ensure the safety of Americans and our allies.”

He said Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general and former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, “will be by my side as we work to defeat radical Islamic terrorism, navigate geopolitical challenges and keep Americans safe at home and abroad.”

Trump is a foreign policy novice, and his early moves on national security are being closely watched both domestically and globally.

Like Sessions, Pompeo will need to be confirmed by the Senate before assuming the role. Flynn does not require confirmation.

Even though Republicans control the Senate, Sessions could face obstacles with his confirmation.

He withdrew from consideration for a federal judgeship in 1986 after being accused of making racist comments while serving as a U.S. attorney in Alabama.

Sessions, the first senator to endorse Trump, has been a leading proponent of tough immigration enforcement policies. He's tangled with the past two Democratic-appointed attorneys general on whether terrorism suspects deserve the protections of American civilian courts and on the planned closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. He's also been protective of the attorney general's right to refuse a legally unsound directive from the president.

Pompeo is a conservative Republican and a strong critic of Obama's nuclear deal with Iran. A three-term congressman, he graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point and from Harvard Law School.

Pompeo has said that Muslim leaders are ""potentially complicit"" in terrorist attacks if they do not denounce those made in the name of Islam.

""They must cite the Koran as evidence that the murder of innocents is not permitted,"" he said in a 2013 House floor speech.

Flynn was a critic of Obama's military and foreign policy long before he began advising Trump on national security issues during the presidential campaign. As national security adviser, Flynn would work in the West Wing and have frequent access to Trump.

The 57-year-old has been outspoken in his warnings about the dangers of Islamist groups, saying the U.S. needs to ""discredit"" radical Islam. He's called Islam a ""political ideology"" and said it ""definitely hides behind being a religion.""

Flynn has also worried some national security experts with his warmth toward Russia. Like Trump, he's called for the U.S. to work more closely with Moscow.

Last year, Flynn traveled to Moscow to join Russian President Vladimir Putin at a celebration for RT, a television channel funded by the Russian government. Flynn said he had been paid for taking part in the event, but brushed aside concerns that he was aiding a Russian propaganda effort.

Trump has made no public appearances this week, but his meetings have signaled a focus on national security. He met Thursday with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, his first face-to-face meeting with a foreign leader since winning the election Nov. 8.

He also consulted with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and sat down with South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, a potential contender to lead the State Department.

In a separate gesture of reconciliation with establishment Republicans, Trump plans to meet on Saturday with 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who lambasted Trump as a ""con man"" and a ""fraud"" in a stinging speech in March. Trump responded by repeatedly referring to Romney as a ""loser.""

The two began mending fences after Trump's victory when Romney called to offer congratulations. They are to meet this weekend, a transition official says. Campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said they are still ""working on"" the meeting.

Since his stunning victory over Hillary Clinton, Trump has spoken with Putin, British Prime Minister Theresa May and nearly three dozen other world leaders by telephone.

Ron Dermer, Israel's ambassador to the United States, also visited Trump Tower and called the billionaire businessman ""a true friend of Israel.""

(CNN) -- Attorney General Eric Holder announced last week that the Justice Department's civil rights investigation of Cleveland's police department found that it engaged in a ""pattern or practice"" of unreasonable and unnecessary use of force.

Coming on the heels of the death of 12-year-old Tamir Rice, who was shot and killed by a Cleveland police officer, many have wondered if this conclusion and damning report proves anything about Rice's death.

Not directly.

But this report doesn't exactly help the public's perception of the Cleveland police, either.

To many, the involvement of the federal government in investigating the killings of Rice, Michael Brown, and Eric Garner are a welcome event. After all, federal law enforcement does not have the intimate working relationship that local state investigators likely have with the police force -- a relationship that could compromise an internal investigation.

The federal government is designed as a limited government. There is supposed to be no general federal ""police power"" -- that is, no right of the federal government to regulate for the health, safety, or general welfare of the citizenry. The reality is, legislation and court decisions over the past century have gradually expanded the federal government's control and review of local activities.

In these cases, authority to review the practices of law enforcement agencies potentially violating federal rights comes from the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.

And the DOJ is increasingly vigilant in enforcing these laws. In just the last five years, the Civil Rights Division initiated more than 20 investigations of police departments, which it claims is more than twice as many investigations than were opened in the previous five fiscal years. It would seem that the modern DOJ has made civil rights a priority.

(The Cleveland police said in a statement they've begun remedial measures and ""much more work is needed."")

The Cleveland report itself is almost chilling in its detailed narration of specific instances of excessive police force. But that's not all: The reported procedures, policies, and tactics are also equally as concerning. Among the findings:

1. 'Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice ... '

Would you be surprised to learn that the DOJ previously investigated the CDP in 2002 and found similar deficiencies? How about the fact that in 2004, the Justice Department and CDP entered into an agreement to correct these problems, including revising its use of force policy and establishing new procedures for -- you guessed it -- reviewing officer-involved shootings.

3. It's the little things ...

This is a minor detail, but a potentially divisive one. The DOJ observed a sign hanging in a district station identifying it as a ""forward operating base,"" which is a military term for an outpost in a war zone. People sympathetic to law enforcement might say ""no big deal -- that's part of police culture."" To other members of the community and to the Justice Department, this is disturbing evidence of police culture: that CDP is more of an occupying army than a community partner.

4. What documents?

Were this not such a serious matter, the DOJ would LOL at CDP's document retention and production. The Cleveland department failed to produce deadly force investigations that occurred after April of 2013. CDP failed for some time to produce certain 2012 use of less lethal force reports. CDP failed to provide dozens of additional Internal Affairs investigations. It failed to provide final dispositions for every civilian complaint, including complaints filed two years ago. It failed to provide Taser firing histories.

Should I go on? If document-shredding Enron were still around today, even they would say of CDP's document retention policy: ""Come on, guys. Get it together.""

5. Basic mistakes and failures

The report found tactical errors and a failure to follow basic, generally accepted techniques for responding to an armed suspect. In one such case in 2011, officers failed to control the scene, failed to designate locations from which officers could seek cover and contain the threat, failed to use a negotiator, and grouped together with little or no cover.

Look for critics to point to these findings as support for the proposition that the CDP's response to the Rice call was bungled.

These are just a sampling of the findings by the Justice Department. The actual report contains other procedural concerns and is worth a long read.

DOJ and Cleveland have now committed to developing a consent decree. This time, it will include an independent monitor and be court-enforceable.

In the past several months citizens have repeatedly demanded, and expected, the intervention of federal law enforcement in these alleged cases of excessive force. This shows how embedded the idea of federal review is among the public.

But the Constitution never provided for the federal government to review local police practices -- that jurisdiction was created by Congress, and really not that long ago.

If not for that legislation, the police would ultimately only be policed ... by the police.

It was n't just the decision to appoint a special counsel that raised eyebrows . It was also the person put into the job : Mueller , who spent his career in the FBI and who takes the post just weeks after Trump startled lawmakers and officials from both parties by abruptly firing FBI Director James Comey ( who is also , incidentally , Mueller ’ s close friend ) .
In the aftermath of the firing , congressional Democrats began calling for a special counsel or special prosecutor to take over the investigation because of fears that the Justice Department would n't be able or willing to properly investigate Trump and his current and former aides .

That 's why the announcement by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein came as a surprise to so many people — including the White House , which was reportedly given just 30 minutes ’ warning before the announcement went public .
If Rosenstein ’ s name sounds familiar , it ’ s because the administration initially claimed that Trump only decided to fire Comey after Rosenstein sent a letter to the White House recommending that he do so . This turned out to have been a lie — Trump later admitted that he ’ d already decided to fire Comey long before Rosenstein ’ s letter .
So when Rosenstein announced that he had appointed a special counsel , it had the feel of a career lawyer with a reputation for probity and nonpartisanship striking a blow at a White House that had thrown him under the bus by trying to make him the scapegoat for the Comey firing .
“ My decision is not a finding that crimes have been committed or that any prosecution is warranted , ” Rosenstein said in a DOJ press release . “ I have made no such determination . What I have determined is that based upon the unique circumstances , the public interest requires me to place this investigation under the authority of a person who exercises a degree of independence from the normal chain of command . ”
There 's a lot to unpack there , including the fact that Mueller wo n't have the powers many people assume . He also wo n't be entirely independent . But he 'll have a lot of power all the same — and is probably almost literally the last person Trump would want in the job .
A special counsel is weaker than an independent special prosecutor
Special prosecutors and special counsels are both appointed to remove conflicts of interest in federal criminal investigations , if the situation would otherwise lead to officials investigating their own superiors . They are supposed to be independent , usually either judges or highly respected attorneys .
But while the two terms are often used interchangeably in the media — and , more confusingly , by members of Congress who should know better — they ’ re not quite the same thing .
In 1978 , in the wake of the Watergate scandal , Congress passed the Ethics in Government Act , creating something called a “ special prosecutor ” ( also called an “ independent counsel ” ) who would be independent from the supervision and control of the president . The role was to investigate and prosecute — in a court of law — possible violations of federal law by high-level officials .
The 1978 law also created a special three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit , appointed by the chief justice of the Supreme Court , that would be responsible for appointing and overseeing a special prosecutor when formally asked to do so by the attorney general .
Under that law , only the attorney general had the authority to request that the panel appoint a special prosecutor . Majorities on either the House or Senate Judiciary Committee could formally ask the attorney general to file a request , but — because of the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution — the attorney general could still technically say no . They would merely have to tell Congress why they were refusing to do it .
The law creating special prosecutors expired in 1999 , when Congress chose not to renew it . That meant that the whole mechanism for establishing an independent special prosecutor went away .
So the Justice Department decided instead to use its own powers to create something similar within the department itself : a “ special counsel . ”
This person is appointed directly by the attorney general ( not an independent three-judge panel , like before ) and — this is the important part — is thus directly answerable to the attorney general . This person can pursue criminal indictments in grand jury investigations , but the attorney general can fire them at any time and overrule any decisions they make when it comes to investigating or prosecuting the case .
In other words , the special counsel is far , far less independent than the earlier version was .
Still , it 's a powerful post . Mueller will be able to issue subpoenas , forcing people to testify and turn over documents . Whether he chooses to do so , of course , remains to be seen .
So that ’ s what we have today . In this case , Attorney General Jeff Sessions had already formally recused himself from participating in any Trump-Russia investigations , so the next person in line , Rosenstein , was the person with the authority to appoint a special counsel .
“ Special Counsel Mueller will have all appropriate resources to conduct a thorough and complete investigation , ” Rosenstein said in the DOJ announcement .
The order specifically gives Muller the legal authority to investigate “ any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump ” as well as any crimes that may take place during the investigation , including things like perjury , obstruction of justice , and witness intimidation .
And if Mueller finds enough evidence , he can seek an indictment against the suspect or suspects from a federal grand jury . If the grand jury chooses to indict , the case would then potentially go to a federal criminal trial .
Peter Zeidenberg , who served as the assistant special counsel in the investigation of former White House aide Scooter Libby in 2005 , noted in a recent Washington Post op-ed that special counsels “ are not journalists , and their job is not to inform the public of the results of their investigations . ”
“ Rather , their mission is to gather all of the relevant facts and determine whether a crime was committed and , if so , whether it can be proved in court beyond a reasonable doubt , ” Zeidenberg wrote . “ Their work , when done properly , is done in secret . ''
Which means that Mueller could very well find a bunch of fishy or wildly inappropriate stuff that Trump or his campaign team did , but if none of those things were actually illegal — or if Mueller doesn ’ t think he has enough evidence to bring the case to federal court — the public might never hear about any of the stuff he found .
( There are still the separate and ongoing House and Senate probes into Trump ’ s Russia ties , though , and the members of Congress involved in those probes could presumably subpoena any documents the special counsel investigation collected and choose to reveal those to the public if they wanted to . )
And , of course , Mueller can still be dismissed at any time by Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein , who can in turn be dismissed by Trump .","The Justice Department’s decision to appoint former FBI Director Robert Mueller as a special counsel charged with investigating possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia is a win for Democrats, a new blow to a reeling White House, and a clear sign that the scandal that has engulfed the administration will only accelerate in the weeks and months ahead.

It wasn't just the decision to appoint a special counsel that raised eyebrows. It was also the person put into the job: Mueller, who spent his career in the FBI and who takes the post just weeks after Trump startled lawmakers and officials from both parties by abruptly firing FBI Director James Comey (who is also, incidentally, Mueller’s close friend).

In the aftermath of the firing, congressional Democrats began calling for a special counsel or special prosecutor to take over the investigation because of fears that the Justice Department wouldn't be able or willing to properly investigate Trump and his current and former aides. But few seemed to think that would actually happen.

That's why the announcement by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein came as a surprise to so many people — including the White House, which was reportedly given just 30 minutes’ warning before the announcement went public.

If Rosenstein’s name sounds familiar, it’s because the administration initially claimed that Trump only decided to fire Comey after Rosenstein sent a letter to the White House recommending that he do so. This turned out to have been a lie — Trump later admitted that he’d already decided to fire Comey long before Rosenstein’s letter.

So when Rosenstein announced that he had appointed a special counsel, it had the feel of a career lawyer with a reputation for probity and nonpartisanship striking a blow at a White House that had thrown him under the bus by trying to make him the scapegoat for the Comey firing.

A special counsel is weaker than an independent special prosecutor

Special prosecutors and special counsels are both appointed to remove conflicts of interest in federal criminal investigations, if the situation would otherwise lead to officials investigating their own superiors. They are supposed to be independent, usually either judges or highly respected attorneys.

But while the two terms are often used interchangeably in the media — and, more confusingly, by members of Congress who should know better — they’re not quite the same thing.

In 1978, in the wake of the Watergate scandal, Congress passed the Ethics in Government Act, creating something called a “special prosecutor” (also called an “independent counsel”) who would be independent from the supervision and control of the president. The role was to investigate and prosecute — in a court of law — possible violations of federal law by high-level officials.

The 1978 law also created a special three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, appointed by the chief justice of the Supreme Court, that would be responsible for appointing and overseeing a special prosecutor when formally asked to do so by the attorney general.

Under that law, only the attorney general had the authority to request that the panel appoint a special prosecutor. Majorities on either the House or Senate Judiciary Committee could formally ask the attorney general to file a request, but — because of the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution — the attorney general could still technically say no. They would merely have to tell Congress why they were refusing to do it.

The law creating special prosecutors expired in 1999, when Congress chose not to renew it. That meant that the whole mechanism for establishing an independent special prosecutor went away.

So the Justice Department decided instead to use its own powers to create something similar within the department itself: a “special counsel.”

This person is appointed directly by the attorney general (not an independent three-judge panel, like before) and — this is the important part — is thus directly answerable to the attorney general. This person can pursue criminal indictments in grand jury investigations, but the attorney general can fire them at any time and overrule any decisions they make when it comes to investigating or prosecuting the case.

In other words, the special counsel is far, far less independent than the earlier version was.

Still, it's a powerful post. Mueller will be able to issue subpoenas, forcing people to testify and turn over documents. Whether he chooses to do so, of course, remains to be seen.

So that’s what we have today. In this case, Attorney General Jeff Sessions had already formally recused himself from participating in any Trump-Russia investigations, so the next person in line, Rosenstein, was the person with the authority to appoint a special counsel.

What does this mean for the investigation going forward?

“Special Counsel Mueller will have all appropriate resources to conduct a thorough and complete investigation,” Rosenstein said in the DOJ announcement.

So what, exactly, is the FBI chief investigating?

The order specifically gives Muller the legal authority to investigate “any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump” as well as any crimes that may take place during the investigation, including things like perjury, obstruction of justice, and witness intimidation.

And if Mueller finds enough evidence, he can seek an indictment against the suspect or suspects from a federal grand jury. If the grand jury chooses to indict, the case would then potentially go to a federal criminal trial.

However, there are some caveats.

Peter Zeidenberg, who served as the assistant special counsel in the investigation of former White House aide Scooter Libby in 2005, noted in a recent Washington Post op-ed that special counsels “are not journalists, and their job is not to inform the public of the results of their investigations.”

“Rather, their mission is to gather all of the relevant facts and determine whether a crime was committed and, if so, whether it can be proved in court beyond a reasonable doubt,” Zeidenberg wrote. “Their work, when done properly, is done in secret.""

Which means that Mueller could very well find a bunch of fishy or wildly inappropriate stuff that Trump or his campaign team did, but if none of those things were actually illegal — or if Mueller doesn’t think he has enough evidence to bring the case to federal court — the public might never hear about any of the stuff he found.

(There are still the separate and ongoing House and Senate probes into Trump’s Russia ties, though, and the members of Congress involved in those probes could presumably subpoena any documents the special counsel investigation collected and choose to reveal those to the public if they wanted to.)

And, of course, Mueller can still be dismissed at any time by Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein, who can in turn be dismissed by Trump.",www.vox.com,left,377R6FVF8gIBW92l

Grindler was named as one of the top DOJ officials responsible for the fatal Fast and Furious operation by the DOJ inspector general .
“ We determined that Grindler learned on December 17 , 2010 , of the link between weapons found at the Terry murder scene and Operation Fast and Furious but did not inform the Attorney General about this information . We believe that he should have informed the Attorney General as well as made an appropriate inquiry of ATF or the U.S. Attorney ’ s Office about the connection . Grindler told us that he was relying on the FBI to investigate the homicide and that would include investigation of the weapons in question . We found that Grindler ’ s reliance on the FBI was misplaced given that it did not have the responsibility to determine whether errors in ATF ’ s investigation led to the weapons ending up at the murder scene or why ATF failed to take law enforcement action against Avila for nearly one year and did so only after Agent Terry ’ s murder . We also believe that Grindler should have ensured that the Department of Homeland Security was informed about the linkage. ” ( p. 454 )
Grindler was also shown in a joint report issued by Chairman of the House Overisight Committee Darrell Issa and Senator Chuck Grassley to be at a minimum incompetent .
“ Given the circumstances surrounding Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry ’ s death , one would expect Justice Department officials to have some recollection of the event . Instead , Department officials seem to have experienced collective memory loss … Gary Grindler [ indicated that he could ‘ not recall ’ or did ‘ not know ’ ] 29 times during his interview with investigators. ” ( p.103 )
“ Acting Deputy Attorney General Gary Grindler took a management approach of delegating tasks and responsibilities to his subordinates and then remaining uninvolved until problems were brought to his attention . This management style insulated him from problems occurring beneath him . Instead of accepting responsibility for his leadership shortcomings , Grindler instead passed the buck to his underlings. ” ( p.73 )
As Christian Adams has said , Grindler also serves as Holder 's one degree of separation from the scandal .
After today ’ s Inspector General Report on Fast and Furious , Democrats are spinning themselves silly that “ neither the Attorney General nor senior DOJ officials authorized or approved of gun-walking in Fast and Furious. ” But nothing could be further from the truth . In fact , the most senior DOJ official possible , other than the Attorney General himself , fully complicit in Fast and Furious and the murder of Brian Terry is none other than Attorney General Eric Holder ’ s Chief of Staff Gary Grindler .
I have repeatedly appeared on Fox News and said Grindler is the person most likely responsible for allowing this mess to continue , and the ensuing cover up . The report today confirms he is at the center of the mess , and only one degree removed from Eric Holder .
On December 23 , 2009 , After David Ogden resigned because of unspecified conflict with Holder , Gary Grindler was named Acting Deputy Attorney General . In January 2010 , less than a month later , Fast and Furious was approved via a briefing paper as a prosecutor-led Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force ( OCDETF ) Strike Force case , meaning that ATF would join with the FBI , the DEA , the IRS and ICE , led by the U.S. Attorney ’ s Office for the District of Arizona .
With such an array of DoJ agencies involved , it is highly unlikely that Acting Deputy Attorney General Grindler was not intimately involved with approving , reviewing and monitoring the details of the case . And , in fact , on March 12 , 2010 , Grindler visited Arizona and was briefed on Fast and Furious ; his handwriting appears all over power point presentation photos of the guns . At the briefing , Grindler is provided information on the program down to minutiae , including such details as the number of times a particular straw purchaser went in to a “ cooperating ” gun store and purchased guns .
During that March 12 meeting in Phoenix , Grindler took notes about Operation Fast and Furious and made sure to write down that the guns involved in the case did n't have a long gun reporting measure requirement , something DOJ pushed through by regulation last summer .
On top of taking these notes , Grindler sent countless emails back and forth to ATF agents about Operation Fast and Furious and was well informed about exactly what was going on throughout the course of the program .
Chairman Issa is n't surprised with Grindler 's departure and has released a statement saying he expects many more DOJ officials will also be leaving soon .
“ Gary Grindler was appropriately faulted by his Department ’ s own Inspector General for keeping information about a connection between the murder of a Border Patrol Agent and a mishandled department operation away from the Attorney General and the Department of Homeland Security . His departure from the Justice Department is warranted and long overdue , ” Issa said . “ Other figures in Operation Fast and Furious are currently being evaluated for their conduct in the reckless effort that needlessly placed lives in danger . I expect more departures and discipline to come . ”","Attorney General Eric Holder's Chief of Staff Gary Grindler has announced his departure from the Department of Justice.

Grindler was also shown in a joint report issued by Chairman of the House Overisight Committee Darrell Issa and Senator Chuck Grassley to be at a minimum incompetent.

“Given the circumstances surrounding Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry’s death, one would expect Justice Department officials to have some recollection of the event. Instead, Department officials seem to have experienced collective memory loss … Gary Grindler [indicated that he could ‘not recall’ or did ‘not know’] 29 times during his interview with investigators.” (p.103)



“Acting Deputy Attorney General Gary Grindler took a management approach of delegating tasks and responsibilities to his subordinates and then remaining uninvolved until problems were brought to his attention. This management style insulated him from problems occurring beneath him. Instead of accepting responsibility for his leadership shortcomings, Grindler instead passed the buck to his underlings.” (p.73)

As Christian Adams has said, Grindler also serves as Holder's one degree of separation from the scandal.

After today’s Inspector General Report on Fast and Furious, Democrats are spinning themselves silly that “neither the Attorney General nor senior DOJ officials authorized or approved of gun-walking in Fast and Furious.” But nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, the most senior DOJ official possible, other than the Attorney General himself, fully complicit in Fast and Furious and the murder of Brian Terry is none other than Attorney General Eric Holder’s Chief of Staff Gary Grindler.



I have repeatedly appeared on Fox News and said Grindler is the person most likely responsible for allowing this mess to continue, and the ensuing cover up. The report today confirms he is at the center of the mess, and only one degree removed from Eric Holder.



On December 23, 2009, After David Ogden resigned because of unspecified conflict with Holder, Gary Grindler was named Acting Deputy Attorney General. In January 2010, less than a month later, Fast and Furious was approved via a briefing paper as a prosecutor-led Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) Strike Force case, meaning that ATF would join with the FBI, the DEA, the IRS and ICE, led by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Arizona.



With such an array of DoJ agencies involved, it is highly unlikely that Acting Deputy Attorney General Grindler was not intimately involved with approving, reviewing and monitoring the details of the case. And, in fact, on March 12, 2010, Grindler visited Arizona and was briefed on Fast and Furious; his handwriting appears all over power point presentation photos of the guns. At the briefing, Grindler is provided information on the program down to minutiae, including such details as the number of times a particular straw purchaser went in to a “cooperating” gun store and purchased guns.

During that March 12 meeting in Phoenix, Grindler took notes about Operation Fast and Furious and made sure to write down that the guns involved in the case didn't have a long gun reporting measure requirement, something DOJ pushed through by regulation last summer.



On top of taking these notes, Grindler sent countless emails back and forth to ATF agents about Operation Fast and Furious and was well informed about exactly what was going on throughout the course of the program.

Chairman Issa isn't surprised with Grindler's departure and has released a statement saying he expects many more DOJ officials will also be leaving soon.

“Gary Grindler was appropriately faulted by his Department’s own Inspector General for keeping information about a connection between the murder of a Border Patrol Agent and a mishandled department operation away from the Attorney General and the Department of Homeland Security. His departure from the Justice Department is warranted and long overdue,” Issa said. “Other figures in Operation Fast and Furious are currently being evaluated for their conduct in the reckless effort that needlessly placed lives in danger. I expect more departures and discipline to come.”",www.townhall.com,right,XgD3aTZ2Dkjfur8k

justice,CNN (Web News),0,http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/13/politics/sessions-what-to-watch/index.html,6 questions for Attorney General Jeff Sessions,2017-06-13,Tom Lobianco,"Washington ( CNN ) The Senate intelligence committee will grill Attorney General Jeff Sessions Tuesday afternoon , just as a slew of new questions about him have bubbled to the top of the Russia probes .
Former FBI Director James Comey launched Sessions into the spotlight with his own testimony last week . Now Sessions will take the same stage . Lawmakers have already aired many of their concerns about their former colleague -- from his meetings with the Russian ambassador to the US to his role in the firing of Comey .
And then an ally of President Donald Trump suggested the President is thinking about firing the special counsel investigating the Russia issue .
1 . How many times did Sessions meet with Sergey Kislyak ?
Sessions recused himself from overseeing the federal probe into ties between the Trump campaign and Russian officials , just a day after The Washington Post reported that he had two undisclosed meetings with Sergey Kislyak , the Russian ambassador to the US .
But reports of a possible third meeting between Sessions and Kislyak have occupied congressional investigators since then . Comey , according to sources , told senators that investigators overheard Russians discussing a third , private meeting Sessions had with Kislyak . ( Sessions ' spokespeople have denied a third meeting happened . )
Two Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee -- Sens . Al Franken and Patrick Leahy -- who initially pressed Sessions in his confirmation hearings on Russian contacts -- wrote to Comey seeking an investigation into whether Sessions perjured himself when he said he had no contacts .
2 . Why did Comey assume Sessions would recuse himself earlier than he did ?
While answering questions about why he did n't alert other officials about Trump 's request that he end his investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn , Comey said that FBI officials long expected Sessions to recuse himself from overseeing the Russia probe .
JUST WATCHED Sessions , from Eagle Scout to attorney general Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Sessions , from Eagle Scout to attorney general 02:18
`` Our judgment , as I recall , was that he was very close to and inevitably going to recuse himself for a variety of reasons . We also were aware of facts that I ca n't discuss in an open setting that would make his continued engagement in a Russia-related investigation problematic , '' Comey said .
The `` variety of reasons '' line , followed by admonishment that he could n't discuss the answer in an open setting perked a lot of ears . Why would Comey think Sessions was going to recuse himself ?
The view of the US attorney general coming before a group of aggressive senators may paint a picture similar to the media bonanza of Comey 's blockbuster hearing last week . But it 's more likely to resemble the public hearing that happened just a day before Comey , where four top intelligence officials were grilled mercilessly , but offered little information .
At one point , Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats cautioned that he would have to consult with the White House counsel 's office before even answering questions in a classified session because they may invoke executive privilege .
It 's all led to a critical question of when and if Sessions will cite privilege -- used by presidents to block testimony before Congress by their aides on certain topics .
Even the standard process itself of invoking executive privilege could be jumbled by the Russia probe . Invoking of executive privilege for administration employees is typically formally announced by the attorney general , but it 's not exactly clear who would make the formal announcement for Sessions , said Michael Bahar , former Democratic staff director for the House intelligence committee and former White House lawyer .
`` Everything is being looked at anew , as of late , '' said Bahar , who now runs the cybersecurity practice for Eversheds Sutherland US in Washington .
The tool covers discussions with the president , Bahar noted , and could be used to protect discussions of Comey 's firing and questions about the President 's request to Comey to drop the Flynn investigation .
Sessions and Trump have been close allies for more than a year now -- Sessions was Trump 's earliest supporter in the Senate and his top staff became some of Trump 's most important advisers .
Also , the two were together on issues like immigration and trade when , at the time , Sessions was often a voice in the wilderness among other Senate Republicans .
JUST WATCHED Paul : Look at facts , but Russia investigation all 'sour grapes ' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Paul : Look at facts , but Russia investigation all 'sour grapes ' 01:59
That 's why the reports last week that Sessions offered to resign over a new , incredible strain between the two , was pretty surprising . Multiple reports have cited sources saying that central to that split was Trump 's belief that Sessions should never have recused himself from overseeing the Russia probe . ( And , implicitly , that Sessions would be in a position to `` lift the cloud '' of the Russia investigation if he was still overseeing it . )
Sessions certainly is n't expected to hit his boss while testifying on live television , but look for senators to try and get at how much pressure Trump has put on him .
5 . Why was Sessions involved in the firing of Comey if he had stepped aside from the Russia probe ?
Sessions stepped aside from the Russia probe on March 2 .

CORRECTION : This story has been updated to correct Michael Bahar 's law firm .","Washington (CNN) The Senate intelligence committee will grill Attorney General Jeff Sessions Tuesday afternoon, just as a slew of new questions about him have bubbled to the top of the Russia probes.

Former FBI Director James Comey launched Sessions into the spotlight with his own testimony last week. Now Sessions will take the same stage. Lawmakers have already aired many of their concerns about their former colleague -- from his meetings with the Russian ambassador to the US to his role in the firing of Comey.

And then an ally of President Donald Trump suggested the President is thinking about firing the special counsel investigating the Russia issue.

There's lots of questions for Sessions. Here are six:

1. How many times did Sessions meet with Sergey Kislyak?

Sessions recused himself from overseeing the federal probe into ties between the Trump campaign and Russian officials, just a day after The Washington Post reported that he had two undisclosed meetings with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the US.

But reports of a possible third meeting between Sessions and Kislyak have occupied congressional investigators since then. Comey, according to sources, told senators that investigators overheard Russians discussing a third, private meeting Sessions had with Kislyak. (Sessions' spokespeople have denied a third meeting happened.)

Two Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee -- Sens. Al Franken and Patrick Leahy -- who initially pressed Sessions in his confirmation hearings on Russian contacts -- wrote to Comey seeking an investigation into whether Sessions perjured himself when he said he had no contacts.

2. Why did Comey assume Sessions would recuse himself earlier than he did?

While answering questions about why he didn't alert other officials about Trump's request that he end his investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn, Comey said that FBI officials long expected Sessions to recuse himself from overseeing the Russia probe.

""Our judgment, as I recall, was that he was very close to and inevitably going to recuse himself for a variety of reasons. We also were aware of facts that I can't discuss in an open setting that would make his continued engagement in a Russia-related investigation problematic,"" Comey said.

The ""variety of reasons"" line, followed by admonishment that he couldn't discuss the answer in an open setting perked a lot of ears. Why would Comey think Sessions was going to recuse himself?

3. Will Sessions invoke executive privilege?

The view of the US attorney general coming before a group of aggressive senators may paint a picture similar to the media bonanza of Comey's blockbuster hearing last week. But it's more likely to resemble the public hearing that happened just a day before Comey, where four top intelligence officials were grilled mercilessly, but offered little information.

At one point, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats cautioned that he would have to consult with the White House counsel's office before even answering questions in a classified session because they may invoke executive privilege.

It's all led to a critical question of when and if Sessions will cite privilege -- used by presidents to block testimony before Congress by their aides on certain topics.

Even the standard process itself of invoking executive privilege could be jumbled by the Russia probe. Invoking of executive privilege for administration employees is typically formally announced by the attorney general, but it's not exactly clear who would make the formal announcement for Sessions, said Michael Bahar, former Democratic staff director for the House intelligence committee and former White House lawyer.

""Everything is being looked at anew, as of late,"" said Bahar, who now runs the cybersecurity practice for Eversheds Sutherland US in Washington.

The tool covers discussions with the president, Bahar noted, and could be used to protect discussions of Comey's firing and questions about the President's request to Comey to drop the Flynn investigation.

4. What is Sessions' relationship with Trump like, really?

Sessions and Trump have been close allies for more than a year now -- Sessions was Trump's earliest supporter in the Senate and his top staff became some of Trump's most important advisers.

Also, the two were together on issues like immigration and trade when, at the time, Sessions was often a voice in the wilderness among other Senate Republicans.

That's why the reports last week that Sessions offered to resign over a new, incredible strain between the two, was pretty surprising. Multiple reports have cited sources saying that central to that split was Trump's belief that Sessions should never have recused himself from overseeing the Russia probe. (And, implicitly, that Sessions would be in a position to ""lift the cloud"" of the Russia investigation if he was still overseeing it.)

Sessions certainly isn't expected to hit his boss while testifying on live television, but look for senators to try and get at how much pressure Trump has put on him.

5. Why was Sessions involved in the firing of Comey if he had stepped aside from the Russia probe?

Sessions stepped aside from the Russia probe on March 2.

But, two months later, he was involved in the firing of the FBI official overseeing that probe. Senate Democrats have been champing at the bit for more than a month now to get an answer to what exactly Sessions meant when he said he was recusing himself.

Sen. Ron Wyden, a member of the intelligence committee, told reporters he plans to press Sessions on his recusal.

""Based on everything I know, this isn't close to what people believe is a real recusal! When you're recusing yourself, you are stepping aside and this sure doesn't look like it,"" Wyden said, referring to Sessions' involvement in the firing letters to Comey.

""I don't think it compromises sources or methods or in any way harms America's position in the world, so we'll start with that,"" Wyden said. ""But there are a host of issues that relate to his recusal, what he may of known about Mike Flynn, that sort of thing.""

6. Would Sessions support firing Mueller?

Newsmax CEO and Trump friend Chris Ruddy rung the alarms Monday, saying that Trump was seriously considering firing Robert Mueller, who is leading the federal Russia probe. But since the President cannot directly fire the special counsel, the question lands squarely at the feet of Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.

This prompts the question, would Sessions support the President and fire the special counsel, if he requested it? But, because Sessions has recused himself, the question could easily fall to Rosenstein. Both officials are testifying on the Hill Tuesday.

And would Sessions and Rosenstein risk being fired themselves and refuse to fire Mueller?

Clark Neily of the libertarian Cato Institute says , “ In America , I would say the most basic right we have is to be free from state interference , and certainly state violence , absent a legally sufficient reason . ”
Still , he says Black Americans , from their less privileged position in U.S. society , put more emphasis on the idea “ that some system of government needs to remain in place for the protection of people , but in an equal and respectful fashion . ”
But now , “ you do have this strange alliance , or at least a potential alliance between libertarians – ‘ classical liberals , ’ who do tend to be mostly white men – and a movement like Black Lives Matter , ” says Tyler Parry , an African American studies professor at the University of Nevada , Las Vegas .
It may sound surprising that Republican Carla Gericke , in seeking a state Senate seat in New Hampshire , is campaigning for reduced police budgets . The current “ defund the police ” movement in America , after all , has been kindled since the 1980s by left-wing scholar activists , notably women of color such as Angela Davis .
Sometimes , people have a hard time trying to peg the protest politics of Carla Gericke .
As a Republican candidate for the New Hampshire Senate and a “ hardcore libertarian , ” she has been an outspoken activist against the stay-at-home orders handed down by Gov . Chris Sununu during the COVID-19 pandemic . That ’ s a position many people may equate with Trump-style conservatism .
At the same time , however , Ms. Gericke has also been a longtime activist against what she sees as the troubling militarization of American police forces , and she ’ s been mostly supportive of Black Lives Matter efforts to defund the police .
“ I am all for taking part of the budget and moving it away from escalating policing , and maybe move it more toward mental health , community development , and that kind of stuff , ” says Ms. Gericke , who has run against the powerful Democratic incumbent in her district for the past three election cycles . “ That wouldn ’ t really reduce a line item in terms of the budget and wouldn ’ t really be shrinking the government , so for me , that isn ’ t the ideal solution . But I ’ m willing to say I think that would be a step towards a healthier , more peaceful society . ”
She ’ s gotten hate mail for her efforts from both sides of the political spectrum . But like most libertarians , Ms. Gericke ’ s principled opposition to what she sees as ever-expanding and far-reaching state powers – especially the lethal power given to police along with their “ qualified immunities ” from legal accountability – has been a core plank of her political philosophy from the start .
The Republican candidate joined other community activists on the left in 2013 to help lead efforts to keep the city of Concord from purchasing a new Ballistic Engineered Armored Response Counter Attack Truck , or BEARCAT , which city officials said was necessary because of “ frequent demonstrations by officially organized groups which have the potential of becoming volatile . ”
It is the kind of language she finds chilling . “ Concord at the time had had like , two murders in a decade , ” she says . “ But of course they ended up getting their BEARCAT anyway . ”
After what prosecutors have called the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May , the decades-old movement to defund or even abolish municipal police gained public momentum that few had ever seen before . Rooted primarily in the work of left-wing scholar activists since the 1970s and 1980s , especially women of color such as Angela Davis and Ruth Wilson Gilmore , who helped formulate the concept of the “ prison industrial complex ” through the grassroots coalition Critical Resistance , the movement began to describe how the U.S. criminal justice system incarcerates more of its citizens than any other country in the world by far . It argued that , with its massive array of tax-funded prisons and jails , overwhelmingly filled with Black and Latino men , the United States had become one of the world ’ s most violent police states .
“ There are a lot of parallels ” with libertarian views , says Edward Stringham , president of the American Institute for Economic Research , a libertarian think tank . “ In many cases , the police are assigned to do things that they don ’ t have training or capacity to do , even while being trained in a more violent style when dealing with any kind of conflict . ”
“ At least for me , I don ’ t see any justification for this heavily armed group of people , financed by the taxpayers , to be dealing with situations that are , at most , a $ 20 problem for a convenience store , ” says Mr. Stringham , alluding to the complaint that ended in what he , too , calls the police murder of Mr. Floyd .
But there are a lot of differences , too , says Tyler Parry , professor of African American and African diaspora studies at the University of Nevada , Las Vegas .
“ On the one hand , you do have this strange alliance , or at least a potential alliance between libertarians – ‘ classical liberals , ’ who do tend to be mostly white men – and a movement like Black Lives Matter , which also calls for the defunding of the heavy hand of militarized police forces . ”
Indeed , over 70 % of self-identified libertarians are white and 63 % percent are male , according to the Cato Institute , a Washington-based libertarian think tank . By contrast , only 5 % of libertarians identify as Black and 14 % as Latino , the institute found in a 2015 survey with the London-based public opinion data agency YouGov .
“ [ Although ] libertarians and progressives do share a lot , a lot of libertarians are much more willing to be more extreme , and take government defunding to its logical conclusion , rejecting any type of governmental structure , particularly looking at taxation as a form of theft , as well as [ being against ] the notion that the government can send in armed police forces or military units to essentially force its citizens to comply with its laws and regulations . ”
Libertarians often identify with the limited-government philosophies that animate many wings of the Republican Party . They point out that the European traditions of liberal democracy had their early roots in efforts to limit the crown 's enormous power to use lethal force in the name of law and order .
As “ classical liberals , ” many libertarians point out that early thinkers developing ideas of human rights in the 16th and 17th centuries first fought against the criminal justice system . Locating their intellectual roots in the Enlightenment , they often see the first “ activists ” questioning the scope of government authority , especially the crown ’ s use of torture to exact confessions , its declarations of martial law during peacetime , and rejections of the right to habeas corpus .
“ In America , I would say the most basic right we have is to be free from state interference , and certainly state violence , absent a legally sufficient reason , ” says Clark Neily , vice president for criminal justice at the Cato Institute .
“ When you clothe state actors , particularly police officers , with the incredible power and discretion to choose which laws to enforce and then the power to take somebody ’ s liberty and even their life , and then give them the equipment with which to do that , it matters tremendously what forms of accountability are available to citizens , ” says Mr. Neily , who wrote a recent essay assessing Black Lives Matter protests , titling it “ America ’ s Criminal Justice System Is Rotten to the Core . ”
Doug Brown/AP Agents from different components of the Department of Homeland Security are deployed to protect a federal courthouse in Portland , Oregon , on July 5 , 2020 . Protesters also faced off against city police in Portland .
But for scholars like Professor Parry , a consistent libertarian position is often rooted in privilege . Those promoting laissez-faire economics , light-touch government regulations , and a bare minimal police state tend to already have their built-in competitive advantages and see almost all rungs of society in terms of robust competition .
“ My own assumption in terms of where libertarians may go wrong is that I think many people see it as a movement of predominantly white males , and that they already have many of the privileges within society , so they have an assumption that the government is not necessary in directing their lives , ” he says . “ Whereas I think Black people or people of color who are protesting against governmental police forces , they do still recognize that some system of government needs to remain in place for the protection of people , but in an equal and respectful fashion . ”
In fact , as many scholars have pointed out , Black voters as a whole tend to be far more pragmatic and moderate than white liberals , and make up a small part of the progressive wing of the Democratic party . Black voters overwhelmingly chose Hillary Clinton in 2016 primaries , and then overwhelmingly backed former Vice President Joe Biden at a moment when his candidacy was teetering on collapse .
“ The protest movements of the civil rights era were largely in response to what they conceived of as unjust governmental structures , ” Professor Parry says . “ So I think maybe the distinction here is that , on the one hand , you will probably find libertarians and even Marxist activists in some form of agreement that police forces can reflect the tyranny of an unlawful government . But at the same time , the agenda and the goals of what ultimately replaces that government might be very different . ”
Still , amid the current Black Lives Matter protests , a number of progressives , libertarians , and even some religious conservatives have joined forces to oppose the “ qualified immunity ” that courts , including the Supreme Court , have granted police officers . In the decades since judges introduced this legal doctrine through their rulings , shielding officers from being held personally liable for violating certain constitutional rights or using excessive force , qualified immunity has drawn fire from groups across the political spectrum .
In a legal campaign to take on qualified immunity over two years ago , the Cato Institute worked to build a “ cross ideological bridge ” to combat the legally entrenched doctrine , says Mr. Neily . And one of his proudest accomplishments , he says , was to put together an amicus brief for the Supreme Court that included a diverse array of groups , from the NAACP and American Civil Liberties Union on the left to the Alliance Defending Freedom and Americans for Prosperity Foundation on the right .
“ A rash of high-profile , sanction free incidents of police misconduct has sent Americans to the streets in protest , ” these groups contend together . “ [ Qualified ] immunity shields a wide range of official misconduct . The diversity of the signatories reflects how qualified immunity abets and exacerbates the violation of constitutional rights of every sort . ”
Libertarian thinkers don ’ t often use the term “ defund the police ” like their left-leaning counterparts do , however . And Mr. Stringham at the American Institute for Economic Research is part of an ideological subsection of libertarians who argue that much of the work of police departments today would be better served by localized private security .
“ If you look around the country in various jurisdictions , you can see plenty of alternatives to government police , ” says Mr. Stringham , noting a topic he explores in his book “ Private Governance. ” “ Universities like Harvard , Duke , and MIT each have fully deputized private police forces . ”
“ And in general , I would say that ’ s going to create incentives for those police to be acting on the behalf of the students , ” he says . “ Whereas , if you have government police , there ’ s that disconnect where they can pursue an agenda which is independent of the well-being of the population . ”
Like many libertarians across the country , he sees powerful police unions as an obstacle to fiscal and structural reforms that could unburden taxpayers and incentivize police to make “ serve and protect ” more than a clichéd slogan .
Yet others , like Mr. Neily , worry about outsourcing police work to private entities .
“ I ’ m very uncomfortable with the idea of trying to privatize the core function of the police , which is to act as an agent of the state to ensure that necessary laws really are obeyed , ” he says . “ That would necessarily entail at least the potential use of violence , as well as the exercise of substantial discretion . ”
“ You still have to have some understanding of the legitimate functions of a criminal justice system run by government entities , ” Mr. Neily continues . “ And that is , to prevent and when necessary punish conduct that threatens the very fabric of civil society . ”
As a libertarian activist and president emeritus of the Free State Project in New Hampshire , Ms. Gericke , too , has long fought for transparency and accountability in municipal police forces .
“ I do think there is definitely a lot of overlap with these more liberal groups , ” says Ms. Gericke , who grew up under the apartheid regime in South Africa and thus remains suspicious of government power . “ And one of the problems all of us see , in part , is this notion of ‘ law and order. ’ ... It is the fearmongering from the war on drugs . And it is , I believe , partly the institutionalized racism inherent in the prison system – the whole school-to-prison pipeline we can so easily see . ”
More recently , Ms. Gericke joined with the ACLU and New Hampshire news organizations to demand the public release of the names of police officers who have been accused of misconduct , known as the “ Laurie List. ” New Hampshire law exempts this list from the state ’ s existing freedom-of-information laws .
Last year a state judge ordered the release of the list , which includes the names of some 260 cops , but Republican Governor Sununu and law enforcement officials appealed the ruling at the time . In the past month , however , each appears to be rethinking this opposition , and the governor announced the formation of a commission to recommend reforms “ to enhance transparency , accountability , and community relations in law enforcement . ”
As Ms. Gericke woos voters in her district – her campaign slogan is “ Protecting the smallest minority , the individual ... YOU ! ” – she has been heartened to see police accountability finally become a national issue supported by an array of political perspectives .
“ As a libertarian and as someone who ’ s worked against the expanding police state for such a long time , it ’ s sort of a ‘ let ’ s see if it happens ’ kind of thing , ” she says . “ But at least it feels like progress . ”","Libertarians trace their wariness of unchecked police powers back to Enlightenment Age thinkers.

Shared concern about rights

Where the groups differ

But for scholars like Professor Parry, a consistent libertarian position is often rooted in privilege. Those promoting laissez-faire economics, light-touch government regulations, and a bare minimal police state tend to already have their built-in competitive advantages and see almost all rungs of society in terms of robust competition.

Private security forces?

“It feels like progress”

As a libertarian activist and president emeritus of the Free State Project in New Hampshire, Ms. Gericke, too, has long fought for transparency and accountability in municipal police forces.

“I do think there is definitely a lot of overlap with these more liberal groups,” says Ms. Gericke, who grew up under the apartheid regime in South Africa and thus remains suspicious of government power. “And one of the problems all of us see, in part, is this notion of ‘law and order.’ ...

Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, has said he will invoke his constitutional right to remain silent in a civil case brought by adult film actress Stormy Daniels.

It is part of an effort to delay the suit brought by Ms Daniels, who says she had sex with Donald Trump in 2006.

She is seeking to end a non-disclosure deal signed over the matter.

Mr Cohen argues any statement he makes in court could affect a criminal inquiry into his business affairs.

Lawyers for Mr Cohen and Mr Trump have asked for the Daniels case to be put on hold in Los Angeles for 90 days.

As part of that investigation, the FBI raided his offices for information, including on the non-disclosure agreement Ms Daniels signed days before the 2016 presidential election.

What does Trump say?

On Thursday, Mr Trump told Fox News his lawyer was ""a good guy"" but only one among his ""many, many attorneys"".

""He represents me, like with this crazy Stormy Daniels deal,"" he said.

""I don't know his business, but this doesn't have to do with me. He's got a business. He also practises law. I would say probably the big thing is his business. And they're looking at something having to do with his business. I have nothing to do with with his business.""

What is the Fifth Amendment?

The Fifth Amendment to the US constitution states that no individual can be ""compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself"".

Invoking the amendment means Mr Cohen will not have to reveal sensitive information in the wider investigation into his affairs.

A lawyer for Ms Daniels, Michael Avenatti, described Mr Cohen's move as a ""stunning development"".

Who else has pleaded the Fifth?

It was famously used in the 1950s by many of those forced to appear before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) - a congressional panel that investigated communist activities.

The best-known example was the ""Hollywood 10"" - a group of screenwriters and directors who refused to answer questions from HUAC members, citing their fifth amendment rights. The committee jailed them for contempt.

During the Iran-Contra scandal of the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan admitted the US had secretly sold arms to Iran and siphoned off the profits to fund ""contra"" rebels trying to overthrow Nicaragua's socialist government.

Mr Fuhrman was forced to invoke the amendment three times on whether he had used racist language about ethnic minorities, angering the jury.

Why is Mr Cohen being investigated?

The raid on Mr Cohen followed a tip-off by the office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign.

The stunning turn comes as Flynn pleaded guilty to one count of lying to the FBI about his back-channel negotiations with the Russian ambassador – talks that occurred before Trump took office . The special counsel made the plea agreement public Friday morning .
The confidant provided ███ with new details on Friday about Trump ’ s instructions to Flynn . During the campaign , Trump asked Flynn to be one of a small group of close advisors charged with improving relations in Russia and other hot spots . The source said Trump phoned Flynn shortly after the election to explicitly ask him to “ serve as point person on Russia , ” and to reach out personally to Russian officials to develop strategies to jointly combat ISIS .
The confidant told ███ that Flynn felt abandoned by Trump in recent weeks , and told friends about the decision to make the plea deal within the last 24 hours as he grew increasingly concerned about crippling legal costs he would face if he continued to contest the charges .
“ Flynn is very angry , ” the confidant told ███ Friday . “ He will cooperate truthfully on any question they ask him . ”
In a prepared statement , Flynn expressed regret , but also stood defiant against the more scurrilous allegations that circulated about his work with Russia .
“ It has been extraordinarily painful to endure these many months of false accusations of ‘ treason ’ and other outrageous acts , ” Flynn said in a statement . “ Such false accusations are contrary to everything I have ever done and stood for . But I recognize that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong , and , through my faith in God , I am working to set things right . ”
Richard Frankel , a former senior aide to Flynn and an ███ contributor , said Flynn made his decision to cooperate under immense pressure , but he believes it is the right move for the country .
“ I do n't know how much General Flynn knows about any criminal activity that took place during the campaign or in the White House , ” said Frankel , who also served in a senior role at the FBI . “ However , General Flynn was a top adviser to President Trump in the campaign and a top adviser to him when he entered into the WH so if there are bodies buried so to speak , General Flynn would know about them in my opinion . ”
Flynn was charged with lying to the FBI about the nature of his conversations with then-Russian ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak during the presidential transition . Those conversations led Russian officials to temper their response to increased U.S. sanctions , according to the charging documents .
The charge carries a penalty of up to five years in prison , but according to court documents , Flynn likely faces a sentence of zero to six months .
The White House had claimed it was unaware of the substance of those conversations , but today ’ s court documents show Flynn was acting specifically at the direction of senior transition team officials .
On the same day President Obama imposed tough sanctions on Russian facilities in the U.S. for meddling in the election , the Russian ambassador called Flynn to talk about them . After that conversation , Flynn consulted with a senior transition team official who said the Trump “ did not want Russia to escalate the situation , ” so Flynn relayed the request directly to Kislyak .
Russian officials tempered their response to increased U.S. sanctions , and President-elect Trump then tweeted : “ Great move on delay ( by V.Putin ) —I always knew he was very smart ! ”
The documents also show that “ a very senior member ” of the transition team , which ███ has learned was Trump ’ s son-in-law Jared Kushner , told Flynn to contact Russia about a United Nations resolution involving Israel .
The President has denied directing Flynn to make the contacts .
“ No , I didn ’ t direct him , ” Trump said in February , “ but I would have directed him if he didn ’ t do it , okay ? ”
Flynn became the latest and most-senior Trump associate to face charges in Mueller 's probe and arrived at the U.S. District courthouse accompanied by his wife and attorney Robert Kelner after having been processed at the FBI Washington Field Office , where he was fingerprinted and photographed , according to FBI officials .
In court , the retired lieutenant general was asked by Federal Judge Rudolph Contreras if he had ever been a part of similar proceedings , to which Flynn replied that he had not . Contreras then asked Kelner whether he was correct in assuming that Flynn was pleading guilty .
After the hearing , Flynn was free to go , but has to check in with authorities each week . Sentencing has been put off for now — and the judge noted that Flynn is agreeing to cooperate with authorities in other matters .
Flynn had initially resisted cooperating with the investigation , according to people close to the retired general , but he has been facing mounting legal debts and plans to sell his house to help defray costs .
He only recently learned the full scope of the charges he could potentially face . Last week , Trump lawyers received calls from Kelner , alerting them that he could no longer participate in information exchanges with other possible Mueller targets , the first public indication that a plea deal was in the works .
“ My guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the Special Counsel 's Office reflect a decision I made in the best interests of my family and of our country , ” Flynn said . “ I accept full responsibility for my actions . ”
Trump and his legal team have learned of Flynn 's decision via news reports Friday morning , according to sources with knowledge of the situation .
On Monday , Kelner was spotted exiting a meeting at Mueller ’ s offices in Washington , ███ reported .
Flynn is a decorated military officer who once headed the Defense Intelligence Agency and , after leaving government , spoke frequently at Trump campaign rallies . He began facing scrutiny after it was learned he took payment to attend a Russian television event , at which he appeared seated next to Russian President Vladimir Putin .
That scrutiny only increased after he took over as Trump ’ s national security adviser . He was ultimately forced to resign after just a few weeks on the job after it was revealed that he misled Vice President Mike Pence and other administration officials about his meeting with the Russian ambassador .
Flynn initially denied that he discussed U.S. sanctions placed on Russia with Kislyak , but transcripts of Flynn and Kislyak ’ s phone calls reviewed by Justice Department lawyers showed otherwise .

What happened on Monday?

America's second most senior law official was summoned to the White House on Monday amid a report that he had verbally resigned to the president's chief of staff in the expectation that he was going to be fired.

But White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said afterwards: ""At the request of the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, he and President Trump had an extended conversation to discuss the recent news stories.

Without Rosenstein, Russia inquiry in doubt

Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC Washington

If Rod Rosenstein goes, by resignation or firing, the future of Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation would be very much in doubt.

Mr Rosenstein is the reason there is a special counsel investigation, and he has given Mr Mueller a wide mandate to pursue that inquiry wherever it may lead.

It has resulted, for instance, in the successful prosecution of former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort and a plea deal from Donald Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen - both for activities tangential to the Russia probe.

A different person in charge might have nipped those moves in the bud.

Whoever took over if Mr Rosenstein departed - at the moment, Solicitor General Noel Francisco - could decide to curtail the scope of the investigation or push for a speedy resolution.

At the very least, Mr Francisco would assume the oversight duties knowing full well the president is watching very closely and has no hesitation going on the attack - even against members of his own administration - if he feels in any way slighted or wronged.

As Mr Rosenstein will surely attest, it is an unenviable position.

What's the reaction?

Mr Trump said over the weekend he had not made up his mind whether to fire the deputy attorney general in the wake of the New York Times report.

""We will make a determination,"" the Republican president told Fox News in the radio interview, which aired on Monday. ""It's certainly a very sad story.

""I haven't gotten all the facts, but certainly it's being looked at in terms of what took place - If anything took place.""

Sean Hannity, a Fox News host and friend of Mr Trump, has urged him to not fire Mr Rosenstein, warning he would fall into a trap laid by his political enemies.

Mr Trump has repeatedly referred to the special counsel's Russia investigation as a political witch hunt.

Andrew McCabe, the former acting director of the FBI who was fired by Mr Trump in March, said on Monday that he was ""deeply concerned"" about rumours of Mr Rosenstein's departure as it would put the Russia investigation ""at risk"".",www.bbc.com,center,3jgO2pnr1dXfK4MF

Last week , the Trump administration put forth its first new ███ of names for federal judgeships in 2019 . All six were men , and apparently all six were white , although the White House declined to answer any questions about their backgrounds .

That ruling is ever more under direct assault in the legislatures—the U.S. Supreme Court is now poised to narrow or deny a woman ’ s right to choose . As Trump packs the federal courts with judges who write openly about “ the moral tragedy of abortion ” or refuse in written opinions to call abortion providers “ doctors ” because “ the object of their action is not healing but killing , ” his defenders continue to claim that there is nothing shocking about the fact that the president ’ s record-shattering 84 confirmed judges are 76 percent male and 91 percent white , per the Federal Judicial Center . ( For comparison , Obama ’ s confirmed nominees were 58 percent male and 64 percent white . ) Not renominated this week was Thomas Farr , the mastermind behind North Carolina ’ s racist voter suppression laws who was tapped to fill seats for which two black women nominated by Obama were blocked by Republicans . Farr would have been only the 3,130th white man to sit on the federal courts , but his nomination was killed in December by GOP Sens . Tim Scott and Jeff Flake .

Senate Republicans have also apparently been mulling the idea of a rules change that would allow them to move even faster on judicial nominations , with Sen.

Trump ’ s boosters continue to tell us that there is nothing troubling about the fact that his judicial picks are almost 80 percent male and 90 percent white . It ’ s essentializing to assume that one ’ s gender or race makes a difference to one ’ s judicial fitness and philosophy , they say .

Even as he hides from and deflects the devastation caused by Trump and Trumpism , McConnell seems sanguine about the fact that the one institution he truly cares about—and let ’ s be clear it is the judiciary , not the Senate—will be the thing that emerges from the rubble : As Homans puts it , “ The shutdown distilled the essence of McConnell ’ s position in Trump ’ s Washington : a man of institutions and establishments whose own legacy was now tied to that of a president who seems hellbent on burning both to the ground . ”
In some sense , then , McConnell is behaving perfectly rationally . His approach—screw the shutdown , screw the Russia interference , and screw any attempt to protect the franchise , we will eventually win in the courts—is just a mirror image of the approach many Trump opponents , including myself , have taken throughout the past two years ( which is to focus on all that other stuff , because for now , the courts appear to be holding ) . But while progressives still hope that an independent judiciary will act as a check on Donald Trump , McConnell is taking a longer view—doing something rather more apocalyptic and decidedly more cynical . He continues to pack the judicial branch with extremely young , radically conservative white Christian men who will—assuming constitutional democracy survives—continue to deliver wins on gun rights and anti-abortion rights as well as the deregulation of environmental , consumer , labor , and other safeguards , long after Trump leaves office .

''
`` I don ’ t believe anybody that was in that meeting would have seen or believed I said one thing that was improper or unwise , '' Sessions told host Tucker Carlson . `` It was really a sad thing to be attacked like that , but I think we ’ ve explained it and we intend to move forward . ''
Sessions spoke to Fox News hours after he recused himself from “ any existing or future investigations ” regarding the 2016 presidential campaign . Lawmakers from both parties had pressed Sessions to step away from an ongoing probe into Moscow meddling during last year 's race for the White House .
Sessions has repeatedly denied meeting with Russian officials or operatives while a surrogate for then-candidate Donald Trump 's campaign . He testified during his confirmation hearing in January that he had no “ communications ” with Russia during the campaign , an answer he later said was `` honest and correct . ''
However , Sessions also said Thursday that he would submit a supplement to the record of his hearing that would cover his conversations with Russian envoy Sergey Kislyak
The attorney general told Carlson that he had intended to announce he was recusing himself from any investigation of the Trump campaign 's connections with Russian figures even before the Washington Post revealed his meetings with Kislyak Wednesday night .
`` I believe I should recuse myself , '' Sessions said , `` because I was involved in the campaign to a degree [ that ] I think [ it ] would have been perceived that I wouldn ’ t be objective [ ly ] participating in an investigation that might involve the campaign . ''
Sessions added that his recusal was `` not an admission of any wrongdoing '' and said that he had acted `` exactly correctly '' in the matter .
In the interview , Sessions detailed his two encounters last year with Kislyak , one of which happened during the Republican Convention in Cleveland this past July .
`` I spoke at the Republican convention at a conference with some 50 ambassadors , '' Sessions recalled . `` After I spoke , I walked down from the podium and mingled with a number of people and we met at that occasion and had a chat , and I left shortly thereafter . ''
Sessions said the other , more involved discussion with Kislyak took place Sept. 8 in his office and was one of several meetings he took with foreign ambassadors as a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee .
`` We talked about a number of issues . One of them was the Ukraine and we had a disagreement over that , '' the attorney general said . `` The Ukrainian ambassador had been into my office for a meeting the day before , and so we had a little disagreement over the Ukrainian issue . So we had a number of discussions like that . ''
Sessions said the meeting with Kislyak in his office was witnessed by two of his senior staffers , whom he described as `` non-political . ''
`` I don ’ t believe there ’ s anything wrong with a United States senator meeting with an ambassador from Russia , '' he said . `` I learned something perhaps in that meeting – I usually did – and so that ’ s what happened . Ambassadors were coming by to see me pretty often . ''
Several top Democrats , for whom the revelations of any Russia discussions only served to fuel long-running accusations that Trump-tied officials have sought to conceal past contacts with Moscow , have called for Sessions ' resignation , including the leaders in both the House and Senate . House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif. , went so far as to say Sessions had “ lied ” to Congress and committed perjury .
Many Republicans jumped to Sessions ’ defense , saying Democrats were engaged in political theater and describing Sessions ’ meetings as routine .
President Trump defended Sessions as an `` honest man '' in a statement released late Thursday .

Judge Richard Leon shot down all four of Fusion ’ s arguments against the release of 70 records of transactions involving some of its clients as well as journalists and researchers it has paid since Sept. 2015 .
Fusion sued its bank , TD Bank , in October , to prevent it from complying with a subpoena issued by the House Intelligence Committee , which has been looking into Fusion ’ s role in putting together the dossier .
That subpoena , issued by committee chairman Devin Nunes on Oct. 5 , prompted Perkins Coie , the law firm that represented the Clinton campaign and DNC , to reveal that it had hired Fusion GPS in April 2016 to investigate Trump .
Fusion , which was founded by three former Wall Street Journal reporters , later hired Christopher Steele , a former British spy with experience in Moscow .
Fusion argued that the court should quash the committee ’ s subpoena on four separate grounds .
The company argued that the subpoena for bank records lacked a valid legislative purpose , that it was too broad and the records being sought were not relevant to the committee ’ s Russia probe , that it violated Fusion ’ s First Amendment rights , and that it violated statutes prohibiting the release of bank records to government authorities . ( RELATED : UNSEALED : Fusion GPS Bank Records Show Russia-Related Payments )
Leon shot down all of the arguments , including Fusion ’ s assertion that Nunes had no grounds to issue a subpoena because he had recused himself back in April from the Russia probe .
“ Unfortunately for plaintiff , the record contradicts its claims , ” wrote Leon , a George W. Bush appointee .
Leon rebutted the claim — pushed by Fusion and Democrats alike — that Nunes had actually recused himself from the investigation .
He pointed to Nunes ’ oft-cited press release in which he ceded control of the committee ’ s day-to-day operations to Texas Rep. Conaway . But “ nowhere in this press release did Chairman Nunes ‘ recuse ’ himself from the Russia investigation , ” Leon notes .
“ He retained the power to issue the Subpoena at issue in this case . ”
Leon also said that the committee ’ s subpoena is not overly broad . He noted that it has already been revealed that Fusion ordered Steele to brief several news outlets on the dossier . Therefore , the subpoena may reveal “ relevant information ” about payments to reporters .
The Intelligence committee has stated in past court filings that Fusion ’ s bank records shows that it has made nine separate payments to three unidentified journalists who wrote about or commented on Russia-related issues during the presidential campaign and into 2017 .
Fusion also did work for a Russian businessman with links to the Kremlin . The oppo firm was paid by the businessman ’ s law firm , BakerHostetler .
Leon also dismissed the idea that the bank subpoena violates Fusion ’ s First Amendment right to free association .
“ Plaintiff points to no authority to support its theory that the freedom of association protects financial records , ” says Leon .
Leon did not set a date for when TD Bank must release the Fusion bank records .","A federal judge has ruled against Fusion GPS in the Trump dossier firm’s quest to block the release of its bank records to the House Intelligence Committee.

“Unfortunately for plaintiff, the record contradicts its claims,” wrote Leon, a George W. Bush appointee.

Leon rebutted the claim — pushed by Fusion and Democrats alike — that Nunes had actually recused himself from the investigation.

He pointed to Nunes’ oft-cited press release in which he ceded control of the committee’s day-to-day operations to Texas Rep. Conaway. But “nowhere in this press release did Chairman Nunes ‘recuse’ himself from the Russia investigation,” Leon notes.

“He retained the power to issue the Subpoena at issue in this case.”

Leon also said that the committee’s subpoena is not overly broad. He noted that it has already been revealed that Fusion ordered Steele to brief several news outlets on the dossier. Therefore, the subpoena may reveal “relevant information” about payments to reporters.

The Intelligence committee has stated in past court filings that Fusion’s bank records shows that it has made nine separate payments to three unidentified journalists who wrote about or commented on Russia-related issues during the presidential campaign and into 2017.

Fusion also did work for a Russian businessman with links to the Kremlin. The oppo firm was paid by the businessman’s law firm, BakerHostetler.

Leon also dismissed the idea that the bank subpoena violates Fusion’s First Amendment right to free association.

“Plaintiff points to no authority to support its theory that the freedom of association protects financial records,” says Leon.

Leon did not set a date for when TD Bank must release the Fusion bank records.

A US judge has sentenced Mexican drug kingpin Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzmán to life in prison plus 30 years.

Guzmán, 62, was found guilty of 10 charges, including drug trafficking and money laundering, by a federal court in New York in February.

He escaped a Mexican jail through a tunnel in 2015, but was later arrested. He was extradited to the US in 2017.

He is a former head of the Sinaloa cartel, which officials say was the biggest supplier of drugs to the US.

Speaking through an interpreter just before Wednesday's sentencing, Guzmán said in the Brooklyn courtroom his confinement in the US had amounted to ""torture"" and said he had received an unfair trial.

The life sentence was the minimum Guzmán faced. The additional 30 years were for unlawful uses of firearms. He was also ordered to pay $12.6bn (£10bn) in forfeiture.

Prosecutors said Guzmán would be serving his sentence behind ""tonnes of steel"", referring to a high-security prison in Colorado.

Guzmán's lawyer Jeffrey Lichtman announced plans to appeal against the verdict.

He argued that the trial had not been conducted fairly and claimed that jurors were influenced by media coverage.

""It was a show trial,"" he said.

Who is El Chapo?

""El Chapo"" (or ""Shorty"") ran the cartel in northern Mexico.

In 2009, Guzmán entered Forbes' list of the world's richest men at number 701, with an estimated worth of $1bn.

He was accused of helping bring hundreds of tonnes of cocaine into the US and of conspiring to make and distribute heroin, methamphetamine and marijuana.

He was also said to have used hitmen to carry out hundreds of murders, assaults, kidnappings and acts of torture.

Key associates, including one former lieutenant, testified against Guzmán.

What was heard during the trial?

It provided shocking revelations about the drug lord's life.

Court papers accused him of having girls as young as 13 drugged before raping them.

Another witness described seeing Guzmán murder at least three men.

He knew what was coming

Analysis by Nada Tawfik, BBC News, New York

Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzmán knew his fate even before he entered the courtroom. The mandatory sentence for his crimes is life in prison. And so his focus throughout the hearing often strayed to his wife and family who were present in court.

From the defence table, he waved and blew them kisses, knowing it may be the last time he ever sees them.

He also used his last moment in public to complain about the US justice system, showing no remorse for his crimes.

Speaking through an interpreter while seated, he said he was denied a fair trial and that the US was no better than any other corrupt country.

That clearly rankled prosecutors. Pointing her finger directly at Guzmán, Assistant US Attorney Gina Parlovecchio hit back and said he was uniquely deserving of a life sentence because of his greed, violence, and corruption.

Why was this trial significant?

Guzmán is the highest profile Mexican drug cartel boss so far to stand trial in the US.

The drug war in Mexico - pitting the Mexican and US authorities against cartels smuggling drugs into the US and the cartels against each other - has killed about 100,000 people over more than a decade.

Guzmán achieved notoriety for twice escaping custody in Mexico as well as avoiding arrest on numerous other occasions.

Among some in his home state, he had the status of a folk hero, a popular subject of ""narcocorridos"" - musical tributes to drugs barons.

In 2016, he gave an interview to Hollywood actor Sean Penn in a Mexican jungle following his escape the previous year and boasted that he was the world's leading supplier of heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine and marijuana.

The case stems from Mr. Obama ’ s November 2014 executive actions on immigration .
One of those actions was to expand his 2012 deportation amnesty , which granted young adult illegal immigrant Dreamers two-year work permits and stays of deportation .

Although most of the expansion was to begin in February 2015 , the three-year permits were granted immediately to Dreamers already in line for two-year permits as of November .

The same is true of the investigation of FISA abuse. We have urged that the attorney general appoint a strong United States attorney from a district outside Washington to conduct a full-blown probe of the investigations that became intertwined in the politics of the 2016 election. The probe would examine whether the Clinton emails and Trump-Russia investigations were conducted evenhandedly, whether decision-making was driven by partisanship rather than evidence, and whether not only Justice Department protocols but criminal laws were broken — including the laws against leaking classified information. But such a probe will be discredited from the start if it is politicized, or perceived as such.

Meanwhile, with vital Justice Department leadership positions already unfilled, the Department’s No. 3 official has just resigned after less than a year in office.

James' office had requested $2.8 million in restitution and a $5.6 million penalty, but Judge Saliann Scarpulla decided $2 million was a more reasonable restitution amount and declined to issue a penalty.

As part of the settlement, Trump admitted to misusing Trump Foundation funds and agreed to limitations placed on future charitable work. If he chooses to start a new charitable organization, he would have to report it to the state attorney general's office, according to an announcement from James' office.

Pointing to courtroom losses on policies such as the travel ban, the Trump administration and its supporters have repeatedly complained of a politicized judiciary they say is determined to thwart the Republican president’s agenda.

Reuters analyzed 41 major rulings in significant cases brought against Trump or his policies and found a more nuanced picture. The administration has certainly suffered courtroom losses, but it has also had important wins.

Moreover, while judges appointed by Democratic presidents have issued many more of the rulings that went against the government, Democratic appointees have also been responsible for a majority of Trump victories. And Republican appointees have handed the administration some of its biggest courtroom losses.

Looking strictly at the numbers, the administration has lost far more often than it has won in court, with 28 rulings that went against its position and 13 in its favor. But those numbers include multiple rulings on the same issues, since some of Trump’s actions have attracted separate lawsuits in several courts.

Victories for the administration have included rulings on healthcare subsidies, deregulation, and Trump’s continued ownership of his business empire. The administration has lost rulings in its bid to prevent teenagers in U.S. immigration detention from obtaining abortions and a plan to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), which protected some young immigrants from deportation.

The administration’s courtroom victories include six in which judges tossed the case outright. Other favorable rulings refused to block Trump policies or orders as cases proceeded.

‘LIMITLESS INJUNCTIONS’

In some instances, when the administration has scored a victory in one court, the policy at issue has nevertheless been blocked nationwide by a judge ruling in a different case on the same policy. This has occurred in legal wrangling over DACA, funding for so-called “sanctuary” cities, and exemptions to birth control insurance. Trump’s travel ban was also blocked by lower courts until the U.S. Supreme Court allowed it to go into effect last December.

Department of Justice spokeswoman Kerri Kupec declined to comment on overall outcomes in the Reuters analysis.

WAR OF WORDS

Numerous legal scholars have expressed concern that Trump’s attacks on the judiciary will undermine public confidence in the courts.

“Those kinds of comments feed into the notion that the system is rigged and people can’t get a fair shake in our federal courts,” said Alberto Gonzales, who served as attorney general under former President George W. Bush, a Republican. “If that’s called into question, it calls into question the integrity of our whole judicial system, and that’s very dangerous.”

After unfavorable rulings, Trump has called the judicial system “broken and unfair,” and “so political.”

Trump’s attacks have raised concern in the judiciary, even among judges who have ruled in the administration’s favor. In a March 5 ruling that largely supported Trump’s bid to wind down DACA, U.S. District Judge Roger Titus had harsh words for the president.

“Thoughtful and careful judicial review is not aided when the president lobs verbal hand grenades at the federal courts, the Department of Justice and anyone else with whom he disagrees,” wrote Titus, who was appointed by a Republican president.

‘A HIGHLY INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY’

Democratic-appointed judges have sided with the administration on, among other things, the border wall with Mexico, deregulation, the end to Obamacare subsidy payments and whether Trump is violating the U.S. Constitution’s anti-corruption provisions.

Republican appointees issued six of the 28 rulings against Trump or his policies, including Washington, D.C. federal judge John Bates who, like two Democratic-appointees, ruled against the administration on DACA.

In lawsuits over threats to withdraw funding from sanctuary cities that limit cooperation with the administration on immigration enforcement, challengers won in three courts, with two of the rulings from judges appointed by Republicans. Trump’s transgender military ban was blocked by four different judges, including one appointed by a Republican president.

“The fact that he’s lost cases decided by Republican-appointed judges and won cases by Democratic-appointed judges helps to demonstrate that the United States continues to have a highly independent judiciary that bases its rulings on the constitution and law rather than the political leanings of the administration,” Ross said.

The administration’s focus on the losses is born of a natural frustration with having initiatives curbed, said Ted Frank, director of litigation for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a Washington-based conservative think tank. But politics are also involved.

Heading toward a face-off with Trump?

Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington

Robert Mueller's investigation has now reached into Donald Trump's political cabinet.

While this is a significant development, it shouldn't come as a major surprise given that Jeff Sessions sits at the intersection of multiple reported threads of the inquiry. The former senator had contact with Russians while he was senior adviser to the Trump campaign. Later he was less than forthcoming about their nature.

Mr Sessions also may know details about why the president sacked FBI Director James Comey, which could be a key component of any obstruction of justice case Mr Mueller builds against the president or his staff.

With the Sessions interview - and recent news that Steve Bannon will also speak with Mr Mueller - there are only a handful of top Trump advisers who served in both the administration and the campaign who have yet to receive a visit from the special counsel's office. Vice-President Mike Pence is one. Donald Trump Jr and Ivanka Trump are two others.

Then there's the president himself.

Mr Mueller's investigation appears to be heading toward a face-off with the president. Then it will be time for the former top FBI man to put his cards on the table.

Why was Sessions questioned?

Mr Sessions, who oversees the FBI at the DoJ, recused himself from the investigation in March 2017 after he acknowledged two previously undisclosed meetings with a Russian ambassador during the campaign.

The president repeatedly criticised Mr Sessions for his recusal on Twitter.

The former Alabama senator could be an important witness due to his ties to the firing of Mr Comey.

The White House initially said that the FBI director's sacking was on the recommendation of the DoJ, citing a departmental memo faulting Mr Comey for his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server.

But Mr Trump later said he was thinking of ""this Russia thing"" when he fired Mr Comey.

Who has been interviewed?

It is not publicly known exactly who has and has not been interviewed as part of Mr Mueller's probe. However, several names have been reported in US media.

Mr Comey was interviewed by the office shortly after he was fired, US media reported on Tuesday.

He was questioned about a series of memos he wrote regarding his interactions with Mr Trump, according to the newspaper.

George Nader, a little-known Steve Bannon associate who boasts of his well-placed connections in the Middle East, was interviewed at least twice, according to Axios.

Mr Trump's lawyers were reportedly in talks with investigators in December about a possible interview with the president.

Who has been charged?

Four people have been criminally charged as part of Mr Mueller's investigation.

Michael Flynn, the president's former national security adviser, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about a meeting with a Russian ambassador.

Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort has been charged on 12 counts, including conspiring to defraud the US in his dealings with Ukraine, and conspiracy to launder money.

Mr Manafort's business associate Rick Gates was also charged with conspiracy to launder money.

A third adviser to the campaign - George Papadopoulos - pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.

Is the FBI impartial?

The White House has repeatedly argued that FBI agents are biased against Mr Trump, who claimed last year the bureau was in turmoil.

Republicans in Congress are claiming to have a secret memo which alleges that agents illegally spied on Mr Trump during Barack Obama's presidency.

So far they have yet to release the four-page secret memo, which Republicans say includes allegations that may warrant criminal charges.

Why attacks on Mueller are mounting

The news of Mr Sessions interview comes a day after Axios reported that FBI Director Christopher Wray threatened to resign as he was allegedly pressured by Mr Sessions to fire his deputy, Andrew McCabe.

Mr McCabe served as acting FBI director before the president tapped Mr Wray to replace Mr Comey.

Shortly after firing Mr Comey, Mr Trump invited Mr McCabe to the Oval Office and asked him who he voted for in the 2016 election, reports the Washington Post.

Mr Trump has criticised Mr McCabe for the FBI investigation into Mrs Clinton's use of a private email server, pointing out that his wife ran for Virginia state office as a Democrat during the inquiry.

Mr. Rosenstein , who oversees the special counsel investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election , has frequently been the target of Mr. Trump ’ s ire . But his position appeared more tenuous after the New York Times reported Friday that in early 2017 he discussed secretly recording the president and recruiting cabinet members to an effort to remove him from office . Mr. Rosenstein denied those reports .
The White House announced the meeting Monday after a morning of confusion and mixed signals . While people close to Mr. Rosenstein told reporters he expected to be fired imminently , White House chief of staff John Kelly told officials in the West Wing that Mr. Rosenstein had already resigned , a White House official said .
Television cameras were trained on black SUVs outside the White House , where Mr. Rosenstein arrived early to talk to Mr. Kelly before a previously scheduled meeting .
The two met one-on-one , people familiar with the meeting said , and Mr. Rosenstein also talked by phone to Mr. Trump , who was in New York . Mr. Rosenstein left the White House shortly before 1 p.m. , carrying a briefcase in the light rain and shaking hands with Mr. Kelly . By early afternoon , the deputy attorney general had calmly returned to the Justice Department and was attending routine meetings , including one on white-collar crime .
Mr. Rosenstein ’ s departure would have far-reaching consequences , sowing uncertainty at the top of the Justice Department and special counsel Robert Mueller ’ s office . His departure would punctuate the long-running battle between Mr. Trump and the nation ’ s law-enforcement establishment , following the president ’ s recent complaint of a “ lingering stench ” at the Justice Department .
White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders , responding to the conflicting reports , issued a statement saying Messrs. Trump and Rosenstein had “ an extended conversation to discuss the recent news stories , ” but signaling nothing further would happen until Thursday , after the president returns to Washington from the United Nations General Assembly .
That meeting creates the potential for a particularly dramatic Thursday in the nation ’ s capital , since Judge Brett Kavanaugh , Mr. Trump ’ s Supreme Court nominee , and his accuser are scheduled then to testify about allegations of sexual misconduct .
The events Monday postponed , rather than resolved , the question whether Mr. Rosenstein will resign or be forced out . He discussed his potential resignation with Mr. Kelly , who summoned him to the White House on Friday and urged him to issue a second , stronger denial of the Times report , people with knowledge of the matter said .
Discussions with White House officials about his future in the administration continued over the weekend . But congressional Republicans have told the White House they fear his ouster could become a campaign issue . Mr. Trump anticipates changes at the top of the Justice Department after the midterms , people close to him have said . Mr. Rosenstein , meanwhile , told friends over the weekend that reports of his desire to record the president were untrue and left the impression that he had no immediate plans to resign . Still , some Justice Department officials were so concerned they gathered at work this weekend to discuss plans for his potential departure .
The initial report Monday from the Axios news agency that Mr. Rosenstein had “ verbally resigned ” unnerved the White House , and the reporter later said he regretted his wording . Mr. Kelly hadn ’ t yet briefed the president on his discussions with Mr. Rosenstein over the weekend . One official , asked about the tumultuous morning in the West Wing , responded in a text message , “ LOL . ”
Meanwhile , at the Justice Department , a spokeswoman was drafting a statement about who would succeed Mr. Rosenstein , based on the Axios report .
The turbulence originated with a Times report last week that Mr. Rosenstein , in the spring of 2017 , suggested secretly recording Mr. Trump and possibly working toward his removal from office , according to memos by then-Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe . Mr. Rosenstein , in discussions with friends over the weekend , said those reports were false and gave no indication he planned to step down , according to people who know him .
Mr. Trump said Monday he had talked with Mr. Rosenstein earlier in the day and looked forward to their meeting on Thursday . “ We want to have transparency . We want to have openness , ” he said . At Thursday ’ s session , he said , “ We ’ ll be determining what ’ s going on . ”
If Mr. Rosenstein leaves his post , any replacement could expect a tough confirmation process , given concerns expressed by Democrats and some Republicans that Mr. Trump has sought to influence Mr. Mueller ’ s probe , which Mr. Rosenstein oversees .
Jay Sekulow , one of the president ’ s outside attorneys , called for a “ time out ” in the Mueller investigation if Mr. Rosenstein departs . “ In light of all of this , I think it ’ s really important that there be a step-back taken here and a review , ” Mr. Sekulow said on an internet broadcast .
Rep.

Rosenstein should continue to do his job , protect the independence of the DOJ , and if the President intends to obstruct justice , force Trump to fire him . ”
Given Mr. Trump ’ s rough relationship with Attorney General Jeff Sessions , Mr. Rosenstein has emerged the Justice Department ’ s main channel to the White House and his departure would create a big gap .
If Mr. Rosenstein ’ s post as Mr. Sessions ’ deputy were to be vacated quickly , a potential replacement on an acting basis would be Mr. Sessions ’ chief of staff , Matthew G.

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – A federal district judge Tuesday struck down the Trump administration’s plan to add a question on citizenship to the 2020 Census, ruling that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross exceeded his authority under federal law.

The much-awaited decision by Judge Jesse Furman is likely to wind up at the Supreme Court, which next month is scheduled to consider a portion of the case – whether Ross can be required to give a deposition about the reasons for his decision. But Furman’s ruling temporarily makes that question moot.

Ross announced the addition of the citizenship question last March, but it has been tied up by a half dozen lawsuits. The government has not asked about individuals' citizenship on the Census since 1950.

Opponents, including California, New York, the American Civil Liberties Union and immigration rights groups, contend fears of deportation among undocumented immigrants will cause them to be undercounted.

In his 277-page ruling, Judge Furman discounted Ross's contention that he made his decision based on the Justice Department's request. Instead, Furman said, Ross opted for the citizenship question for other reasons and then tried to conceal his motives by getting the Justice Department to ask for it.

""The court can – and, in light of all the evidence in the record, does – infer from the various ways in which Secretary Ross and his aides acted like people with something to hide that they did have something to hide,"" Furman said.

Opponents of the citizenship question allege that Ross made his decision after conversations with White House officials, including former chief strategist Steve Bannon, as well as former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

“The court’s finding that the administration concealed its true motives further attests to its hostile intentions,” said Marc Morial, president of the National Urban League.

Dale Ho, director of the ACLU’s Voting Rights Project, welcomed Furman's decision, calling it ""a forceful rebuke of the Trump administration’s attempt to weaponize the Census for an attack on immigrant communities.""

""The evidence at trial, including from the government's own witness, exposed how adding a citizenship question would wreck the once-in-a-decade count of the nation's population,"" Ho said. ""The inevitable result would have been – and the administration’s clear intent was – to strip federal resources and political representation from those needing it most.”

Furman's ruling is sure to be appealed, most likely to the Supreme Court, unless the administration drops the issue. That did not seem likely Tuesday.

“Our government is legally entitled to include a citizenship question on the Census, and people in the United States have a legal obligation to answer,"" Justice Department spokeswoman Kelly Laco said. ""Reinstating the citizenship question ultimately protects the right to vote and helps ensure free and fair elections for all Americans.”

The ultimate court decision could affect the political and financial clout of immigrant communities for the next decade. What's at stake is an accurate count of immigrants in the Census, including the more than 22 million noncitizens. Challengers fear a citizenship question could prompt many to avoid being counted.

That, in turn, could cause parts of the country with large percentages of immigrants – mostly in states dominated by Democrats – to be undercounted, which in turn could result in a loss of federal funds and, potentially, seats in Congress.

The Supreme Court previously refused the Trump administration's request to delay the district court trial. It gave both sides a partial victory when it ruled that Ross did not have to give a deposition concerning his decision-making process before the trial, but other federal officials could be questioned out of court.

Now the question will be whether the high court delays or cancels its Feb. 19 oral argument on whether Ross can be deposed to assess his motives. The court could decide instead to hear the full case on the citizenship question this spring, since preparations for the Census are scheduled to begin this summer.

We failed.,2020-05-01,"Radley Balko, Opinion Writer","And even these grim numbers are assuredly low . As with most other things , when it comes to coronavirus testing , prisoners are a low priority . For example , as of this week , 29 prisoners in New Jersey are confirmed to have died from the virus . But the state has tested less than 1 percent of its incarcerated population . Despite an outbreak at a jail in Miami , Florida has only tested 615 prisoners , with 208 positive . But that ’ s from an incarcerated population of 95,000 . And the state ’ s Department of Corrections only began posting the data after several facilities were caught trying to hide virus-related deaths .
In the facilities that are doing more widespread testing , the figures are jaw-dropping :
— Nearly a quarter of prisoners tested at the Bledsoe County , Tenn. , Correctional Complex have tested positive . Overall , about 20 percent of prisoners tested in Tennessee have tested positive , yet of the 16 correctional facilities surveyed by a local TV news station , 11 had tested five or fewer prisoners . Nashville journalist Steven Hale reported that , of the state ’ s incarcerated population of 30,000 , just under 4,000 have been tested . Two months into the outbreak , the Riverbend maximum security prison in Nashville had tested just two people .
— At a rural prison in Arkansas , 680 of the 1,700 prisoners have tested positive .
— Ohio is one of the few states currently mass testing prisoners . The results are astonishing . At one facility , more than 2,200 prisoners and 174 staffers tested positive . At another , nearly 1,500 prisoners and 93 staff . As of this week , 4,072 of the 6,375 inmates and staff the state has tested are positive for the coronavirus , an infection rate of over 60 percent .
— North Carolina has tested less than 2 percent of its prisoners . But at the one facility where mass testing has been done — Nuese Correctional Institution — 460 of the 770 inmates tested positive , or nearly 60 percent .
— At Lakeland prison in Michigan , the first and so far only prison in the state to test all of its inmates , 785 of the 1,403 prisoners were positive .
— Harris County , Tex . has tested 500 of its approximately 3,000 incarcerated people . So far , 262 have tested positive , an infected-to-tested rate of 52 percent .
— The infection rate at the Rikers Island jail is five times that of New York City , and 30 times that of the United States . The prison ’ s first coronavirus death was a man who had been jailed for a technical parole violation . New York Gov . Andrew M. Cuomo ( D ) has refused to consider mass commutations to prevent further spread .
It isn ’ t much better at the federal level . In early March , after numerous warning from public health officials about the virus in jails and prisons , federal prosecutors were arguing in court filings that prisoners were more protected from covid-19 inside a prison than out . A few weeks later , the Federal Bureau of Prisons put out a statement boasting that only 10 inmates had tested positive . But that ’ s because the agency wasn ’ t testing . Five days later , the number grew to 29 prisoners and 30 staff . Then came the outbreak at the Oakdale facility in Louisiana . Prison officials there responded by simply refusing any more testing of symptomatic inmates .
As of the most recent BOP update , 1,692 federal prisoners have tested positive , as have 349 staff . The Associated Press reported this week that 70 percent of federal prisoners who have been tested have tested positive . At the same time , the Marshall Project recently reported that less than one half of one percent of federal prisoners have been tested .
At the few facilities where mass testing is taking place , infection rates are similar to those we ’ re seeing in state prisons . At the FCI Terminal Island in Los Angeles , for example , half the inmate population has tested positive .
So far , 33 federal prisoners are confirmed to have died from covid-19 . The first confirmed death was Patrick Jones , convicted of possessing cocaine with intent to distribute in a school zone . He had 21 grams of cocaine in his apartment . The “ school ” his apartment was near was a junior college . He was sentenced to 27 years in prison .
The most recent confirmed death was Andrea Circle Bear , a Native American woman who died after giving birth while on a ventilator . Circle Bear was serving 26 months on drug charges . A federal judge initially approved her admission into a drug-treatment program , but that decision was rescinded after federal prosecutors argued that her drug use presented a threat to her unborn child . Instead , she was sent to a prison facility in Texas , where despite her low-level crime , pregnancy and at least one preexisting condition , she was denied release , contracted the virus and died . The Rapid City Journal reports that at her sentencing , U.S. Attorney Ron Parsons told her , “ Don ’ t let yourself or your property get mixed up in the world of illegal drugs . It ends badly . ''

In King County , Wash. , an early epicenter of the outbreak , public defenders filed motions to release low-level offenders , the sick and elderly , and those nearing the ends of their sentences . One attorney told me that while she and her colleagues attended release hearings in person , prosecutors voiced their opposition over the phone to avoid exposure . In Washington , D.C. , city officials assured the public that the jail was taking appropriate precautions , citing written policies .

The city ’ s public defenders did and found the obscene conditions later verified by an independent auditor . In Louisiana , a sitting judge dismissed covid-19 concerns by explaining to colleagues that drug users have bad hygiene and therefore are more of a threat to spread the virus outside the jail than behind bars .
After pressure from some members of Congress , on April 3 , Attorney General William P. Barr issued a memo outlining terms for some federal prisoners to be released to home confinement . But as with the D.C. jail , those policies appear to only exist on paper . The aforementioned Marshall Project report found numerous examples of prisoners being told they would be released , only to find the release orders were subsequently rescinded .

The covid-19 outbreaks are a symptom of the same problem , but distilled , sped up and presented in starker relief .

It assumed they would give a damn .
It was a good-faith assumption , grounded in the notion that even the most retributive among us would want to prevent needless mass deaths behind bars . It was wildly optimistic .","And even these grim numbers are assuredly low. As with most other things, when it comes to coronavirus testing, prisoners are a low priority. For example, as of this week, 29 prisoners in New Jersey are confirmed to have died from the virus. But the state has tested less than 1 percent of its incarcerated population. Despite an outbreak at a jail in Miami, Florida has only tested 615 prisoners, with 208 positive. But that’s from an incarcerated population of 95,000. And the state’s Department of Corrections only began posting the data after several facilities were caught trying to hide virus-related deaths.

In the facilities that are doing more widespread testing, the figures are jaw-dropping:

AD

AD

— Nearly a quarter of prisoners tested at the Bledsoe County, Tenn., Correctional Complex have tested positive. Overall, about 20 percent of prisoners tested in Tennessee have tested positive, yet of the 16 correctional facilities surveyed by a local TV news station, 11 had tested five or fewer prisoners. Nashville journalist Steven Hale reported that, of the state’s incarcerated population of 30,000, just under 4,000 have been tested. Two months into the outbreak, the Riverbend maximum security prison in Nashville had tested just two people.

— At a rural prison in Arkansas, 680 of the 1,700 prisoners have tested positive.

— Ohio is one of the few states currently mass testing prisoners. The results are astonishing. At one facility, more than 2,200 prisoners and 174 staffers tested positive. At another, nearly 1,500 prisoners and 93 staff. As of this week, 4,072 of the 6,375 inmates and staff the state has tested are positive for the coronavirus, an infection rate of over 60 percent.

AD

AD

— North Carolina has tested less than 2 percent of its prisoners. But at the one facility where mass testing has been done — Nuese Correctional Institution — 460 of the 770 inmates tested positive, or nearly 60 percent.

— At Lakeland prison in Michigan, the first and so far only prison in the state to test all of its inmates, 785 of the 1,403 prisoners were positive.

— Harris County, Tex. has tested 500 of its approximately 3,000 incarcerated people. So far, 262 have tested positive, an infected-to-tested rate of 52 percent.

— The infection rate at the Rikers Island jail is five times that of New York City, and 30 times that of the United States. The prison’s first coronavirus death was a man who had been jailed for a technical parole violation. New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) has refused to consider mass commutations to prevent further spread.

It isn’t much better at the federal level. In early March, after numerous warning from public health officials about the virus in jails and prisons, federal prosecutors were arguing in court filings that prisoners were more protected from covid-19 inside a prison than out. A few weeks later, the Federal Bureau of Prisons put out a statement boasting that only 10 inmates had tested positive. But that’s because the agency wasn’t testing. Five days later, the number grew to 29 prisoners and 30 staff. Then came the outbreak at the Oakdale facility in Louisiana. Prison officials there responded by simply refusing any more testing of symptomatic inmates.

As of the most recent BOP update, 1,692 federal prisoners have tested positive, as have 349 staff. The Associated Press reported this week that 70 percent of federal prisoners who have been tested have tested positive. At the same time, the Marshall Project recently reported that less than one half of one percent of federal prisoners have been tested.

At the few facilities where mass testing is taking place, infection rates are similar to those we’re seeing in state prisons. At the FCI Terminal Island in Los Angeles, for example, half the inmate population has tested positive.

In King County, Wash., an early epicenter of the outbreak, public defenders filed motions to release low-level offenders, the sick and elderly, and those nearing the ends of their sentences. One attorney told me that while she and her colleagues attended release hearings in person, prosecutors voiced their opposition over the phone to avoid exposure. In Washington, D.C., city officials assured the public that the jail was taking appropriate precautions, citing written policies. But they didn’t actually visit the jail in person to make sure those policies were being followed.

Dershowitz , a lifelong Democrat , said Trump has the constitutional right as president to fire his FBI director .
“ You can not charge a president with obstruction of justice for exercising his constitutional power to fire Comey and his constitutional authority to tell the Justice Department who to investigate , who not to investigate , ” Dershowitz said during an interview with Fox News .
Talk of the president obstructing justice resurfaced after his former national security adviser , retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI last week about his conversation with the Russian ambassador .
Trump didn ’ t help matters by tweeting over the weekend that he knew Flynn lied to the FBI .
“ I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI . He has pled guilty to those lies , ” Trump wrote . “ It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful . There was nothing to hide ! ”
Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D-CA ) said over the weekend that a Senate investigation into Russia 's interference in the 2016 presidential election has revealed possible obstruction .
`` I see it in the hyper-frenetic attitude of the White House , the comments every day , the continual tweets . And I see it most importantly in what happened with the firing of Director Comey , and it is my belief that that is directly because he did not agree to ‘ lift the cloud ’ of the Russia investigation . That ’ s obstruction of justice , ” Feinstein said on NBC ’ s “ Meet the Press . ”

`` And Sen. Feinstein simply does n't know what she 's talking about when she says it 's obstruction of justice to do what a president is completely authorized to do under the Constitution . ''","President Trump was pleased with constitutional law scholar Alan Dershowitz’s defense of him over his firing of former FBI Director James Comey, calling the Harvard Law professor’s analysis on Fox News a “must watch” interview.

“A must watch: Legal Scholar Alan Dershowitz was just on @foxandfriendstalking of what is going on with respect to the greatest Witch Hunt in U.S. political history. Enjoy!” Trump wrote on Twitter.

Dershowitz, a lifelong Democrat, said Trump has the constitutional right as president to fire his FBI director.

“You cannot charge a president with obstruction of justice for exercising his constitutional power to fire Comey and his constitutional authority to tell the Justice Department who to investigate, who not to investigate,” Dershowitz said during an interview with Fox News.

“We have precedents that clearly establish that.”

Talk of the president obstructing justice resurfaced after his former national security adviser, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI last week about his conversation with the Russian ambassador.

Trump didn’t help matters by tweeting over the weekend that he knew Flynn lied to the FBI.

“I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies,” Trump wrote. “It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!”

Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) said over the weekend that a Senate investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election has revealed possible obstruction.

""I see it in the hyper-frenetic attitude of the White House, the comments every day, the continual tweets. And I see it most importantly in what happened with the firing of Director Comey, and it is my belief that that is directly because he did not agree to ‘lift the cloud’ of the Russia investigation. That’s obstruction of justice,” Feinstein said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”

But Dershowitz disagreed.

""If Congress were ever to charge him with obstruction of justice for exercising his constitutional authority under Article II, we'd have a constitutional crisis,"" he said.

The famed attorney explained “clearly illegal acts” on the president’s part would need to be proven.

""There's never been a case in history where a president has been charged with obstruction of justice for merely exercising his constitutional authority. That would cause a constitutional crisis in the United States,"" Dershowitz said, hoping Special Counsel Robert Mueller understands that.

The then-16-year-old was sentenced by a Texas judge to probation and a California rehab center after pleading guilty to four counts of manslaughter after driving drunk and killing four people in a high-speed crash outside Fort Worth .
At a press conference Tuesday , Tarrant County Sheriff Dee Anderson said that the justice system struggled to fulfill its promise `` the first time '' in the Couch case .
Mr. Couch is likely to face a tougher sentence as he ’ s extradited from Mexico after being caught Monday night in Puerta Vallarta , accused of breaking his parole agreement .
During the trial , a psychologist dubbed Couch ’ s condition “ affluenza ” – a term he later regretted using – suggesting that the teen ’ s wealthy parents were partly responsible for an upbringing where he never faced real consequences for his actions . The term struck a chord with Americans , with the case coming to symbolize the extent to which the justice system treats rich whites differently than poor blacks .
The timing of his capture is likely to once again raise similar questions about equal justice under the law , observers say .

It isn ’ t the first time that the Couch case has been juxtaposed uncomfortably with the death of a black teenager . For many Americans transfixed by the Trayvon Martin shooting in 2012 and the trial of the man who killed him the following year , the verdict in the Couch case offered more distinct “ proof of separate justice systems in this country , one for the rich and another for the poor , and Ethan became the face of wealth and privilege , ” as Michael Mooney wrote in Dallas Magazine for a May feature on Couch and his parents .
The Couch case – along with the acquittal of George Zimmerman , Martin ’ s shooter – came one year before the street protest crescendo that built in the wake of a series of high-profile deaths of black men and women at police hands around the country .

justice,CNN (Web News),0,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/11/politics/greg-craig-trial-justice-department-foreign-lobbying/index.html,DC lawyer's trial to serve as test for Justice Department's foreign lobbying enforcement work,2019-08-11,"Katelyn Polantz, Erica Orden","( CNN ) One of Washington 's most well-known and accomplished lawyers , the former Obama White House counsel Greg Craig , goes to trial Monday in Washington in a case likely to be seen as a litmus test for the Justice Department 's efforts regarding foreign lobbying .
Craig is accused of concealing material information in connection with work he performed for Ukraine after he left the Obama administration and joined the Skadden firm as a partner . According to his charges , he cut a deal in 2012 to earn $ 4 million from a Ukrainian client for the law firm by producing a supposedly independent report on the jailing of a political rival of the then-Ukraine president .
Craig had been caught up in the expansive federal probe of Ukrainian influence in American politics tracked by special counsel Robert Mueller and now led by the Justice Department 's National Security Division and US Attorney 's Office in DC .
The trial will discuss the influence efforts by Mueller defendants Paul Manafort and Rick Gates , both former Trump campaign leadership , who allegedly had tapped Craig to help with pushing a slanted report on Ukrainian politics among American media , according to court records .
The trial will also be , in many ways , a defining moment for the Justice Department 's foreign lobbying enforcement efforts .
In March , the department said it would boost its pursuit of foreign influence operations , in part by appointing a prosecutor who worked on special counsel Mueller 's team to lead a revamped unit intended to crack down on unregistered foreign agents .
In making the announcement , the department 's national security division head , John Demers , specifically cited a settlement involving Craig 's former law firm , Skadden , Arps , Slate , Meagher & Flom LLP , over the work at issue in Craig 's trial as spurring the department 's interest in enforcement regarding foreign lobbying under the Foreign Agents Registration Act , also known as FARA .
The overhauled unit at Justice now has 11 prosecutors , an increase from years prior . The Craig trial -- with its high profile witnesses and recognizable defendant -- poses a test of the Justice Department 's stepped up efforts .
`` Disregard for truth undermines our political discourse and it infects our policymaking . If the people do n't have the facts , democracy ca n't work , '' US District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson , who is overseeing the Craig trial and presided over the Manafort case in Washington , said about these types of alleged lobbying violations at Manafort 's sentencing .
Major trials regarding foreign lobbying violations have been few since the law was enacted in the 1930s .
This year alone , there have been two foreign lobbying cases stemming from Mueller 's work : the Craig case and another recent trial in Virginia , where Bijan Kian , a former lobbying partner of Michael Flynn 's , was convicted for working as a foreign agent of Turkey . A judge is still considering whether prosecutors presented enough evidence at Kian 's trial for the conviction to stand .
`` Every law firm and lobbyist who does this stuff has woken up , '' said Andrew Herman , a defense lawyer who counsels clients on foreign lobbying registration . `` Nobody would wish what 's happening to Craig on anyone . I think he will be the poster child regardless of the result . ''
A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment on the potential impact the Craig trial will have for FARA enforcement .
While coordinating with Manafort 's operation , Craig also allegedly reached out to American reporters to shape news coverage of the report -- and , through it all , had n't disclosed to the Justice Department he was working for Ukrainians , according to prosecutors . Federal law requires those who work on public relations or lobbying efforts in the US to register with the Justice Department under FARA .
Manafort and Gates both admitted to working illegally on the report on behalf of Ukrainian politicians as part of their guilty pleas in the Mueller investigation last year .
In some ways , the Craig case has already imposed significant hurdles for the Justice Department , having bounced between numerous prosecutors ' offices before being charged , CNN has reported . After the investigation of Craig was opened by Mueller in 2017 , the special counsel 's office referred the case to the US Attorney 's office for the Southern District of New York , which devoted significant resources to the investigation .
But that office , despite its aggressive reputation , declined to bring charges , determining that they did n't have sufficient evidence . In January of this year , the case was transferred yet again , this time to US Attorney 's office for the District of Columbia .
But by the time Craig was finally charged in April by the DC office , the statute of limitations for the initial matter for which he was investigated -- failure to register as a foreign agent -- had expired .
Craig was charged at the time with two crimes : making false statements and concealing material information in connection with work he performed for Ukraine . He pleaded not guilty .
But in recent weeks , the Justice Department faced another setback : the judge threw out the charge over making false statements .
If found guilty of the remaining charge , Craig faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison . It is unlikely he would have a sentence so steep , however . Craig was released on a personal recognizance bond following his arraignment in April .
Craig is the highest-profile Democrat to be indicted in connection to Mueller 's work . He 's so well connected in Washington that the list of people who may be mentioned or who may testify at his trial , according to court records , reads like a who 's who list of power and influence inside the Beltway .
Aside from the obvious names of Mueller defendants like Manafort and Gates , jurors will be asked if they 've known former congressmen like Jim Slattery , journalists like David Sanger of the New York Times , longtime Clinton adviser Cheryl Mills , lobbyist and political analyst Doug Schoen , prominent white collar lawyers like Brendan Sullivan or the Atlanta judge Clinton Deveaux . The list even includes two Kennedy family members : Victoria Reggie Kennedy , the widow of Sen.

Soon after the Mueller investigation began , defense lawyers in Washington realized how Mueller was spooking lawyers and lobbyists engaged in foreign work , and began pitching their advice on foreign lobbying registration to clients .","(CNN) One of Washington's most well-known and accomplished lawyers, the former Obama White House counsel Greg Craig, goes to trial Monday in Washington in a case likely to be seen as a litmus test for the Justice Department's efforts regarding foreign lobbying.

Craig is accused of concealing material information in connection with work he performed for Ukraine after he left the Obama administration and joined the Skadden firm as a partner. According to his charges, he cut a deal in 2012 to earn $4 million from a Ukrainian client for the law firm by producing a supposedly independent report on the jailing of a political rival of the then-Ukraine president.

Craig had been caught up in the expansive federal probe of Ukrainian influence in American politics tracked by special counsel Robert Mueller and now led by the Justice Department's National Security Division and US Attorney's Office in DC.

The trial will discuss the influence efforts by Mueller defendants Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, both former Trump campaign leadership, who allegedly had tapped Craig to help with pushing a slanted report on Ukrainian politics among American media, according to court records.

The trial will also be, in many ways, a defining moment for the Justice Department's foreign lobbying enforcement efforts.

In March, the department said it would boost its pursuit of foreign influence operations, in part by appointing a prosecutor who worked on special counsel Mueller's team to lead a revamped unit intended to crack down on unregistered foreign agents.

In making the announcement, the department's national security division head, John Demers, specifically cited a settlement involving Craig's former law firm, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, over the work at issue in Craig's trial as spurring the department's interest in enforcement regarding foreign lobbying under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, also known as FARA.

The overhauled unit at Justice now has 11 prosecutors, an increase from years prior. The Craig trial -- with its high profile witnesses and recognizable defendant -- poses a test of the Justice Department's stepped up efforts.

""Disregard for truth undermines our political discourse and it infects our policymaking. If the people don't have the facts, democracy can't work,"" US District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson , who is overseeing the Craig trial and presided over the Manafort case in Washington, said about these types of alleged lobbying violations at Manafort's sentencing.

Major trials regarding foreign lobbying violations have been few since the law was enacted in the 1930s.

This year alone, there have been two foreign lobbying cases stemming from Mueller's work: the Craig case and another recent trial in Virginia, where Bijan Kian, a former lobbying partner of Michael Flynn's, was convicted for working as a foreign agent of Turkey . A judge is still considering whether prosecutors presented enough evidence at Kian's trial for the conviction to stand.

""Every law firm and lobbyist who does this stuff has woken up,"" said Andrew Herman, a defense lawyer who counsels clients on foreign lobbying registration. ""Nobody would wish what's happening to Craig on anyone. I think he will be the poster child regardless of the result.""

A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment on the potential impact the Craig trial will have for FARA enforcement.

While coordinating with Manafort's operation, Craig also allegedly reached out to American reporters to shape news coverage of the report -- and, through it all, hadn't disclosed to the Justice Department he was working for Ukrainians, according to prosecutors. Federal law requires those who work on public relations or lobbying efforts in the US to register with the Justice Department under FARA.

Manafort and Gates both admitted to working illegally on the report on behalf of Ukrainian politicians as part of their guilty pleas in the Mueller investigation last year.

In some ways, the Craig case has already imposed significant hurdles for the Justice Department, having bounced between numerous prosecutors' offices before being charged, CNN has reported. After the investigation of Craig was opened by Mueller in 2017, the special counsel's office referred the case to the US Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York, which devoted significant resources to the investigation.

But that office, despite its aggressive reputation, declined to bring charges, determining that they didn't have sufficient evidence. In January of this year, the case was transferred yet again, this time to US Attorney's office for the District of Columbia.

But by the time Craig was finally charged in April by the DC office, the statute of limitations for the initial matter for which he was investigated -- failure to register as a foreign agent -- had expired.

Craig was charged at the time with two crimes: making false statements and concealing material information in connection with work he performed for Ukraine. He pleaded not guilty.

But in recent weeks, the Justice Department faced another setback: the judge threw out the charge over making false statements.

If found guilty of the remaining charge, Craig faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison. It is unlikely he would have a sentence so steep, however. Craig was released on a personal recognizance bond following his arraignment in April.

Craig is the highest-profile Democrat to be indicted in connection to Mueller's work. He's so well connected in Washington that the list of people who may be mentioned or who may testify at his trial, according to court records, reads like a who's who list of power and influence inside the Beltway.

Aside from the obvious names of Mueller defendants like Manafort and Gates, jurors will be asked if they've known former congressmen like Jim Slattery, journalists like David Sanger of the New York Times, longtime Clinton adviser Cheryl Mills, lobbyist and political analyst Doug Schoen, prominent white collar lawyers like Brendan Sullivan or the Atlanta judge Clinton Deveaux. The list even includes two Kennedy family members: Victoria Reggie Kennedy, the widow of Sen. Ted Kennedy; and Timothy Shriver, the chairman of the Special Olympics and nephew of the former President. It's unclear if they would be mentioned or testify, either by presenting evidence or speaking about Craig's character as part of his defense.

Gates is expected to testify as a witness for the prosecution, though what he will say on the stand, especially about his interactions with Manafort, will be limited, prosecutors told the court.

One of those proverbial pachyderms was present courtesy of the aspiring Supreme Court justice .
“ There ’ s an elephant in the room with us today , ” Judge Gorsuch wrote in a 2016 concurrence that featured prominently in 11 hours of questioning Tuesday from members of the Senate Judiciary Committee .
The “ elephant ” Gorsuch was trying to draw wider attention to is a legal doctrine known as Chevron deference . Basically , a Supreme Court decision from 1984 states that , as long as a federal agency ’ s interpretation of a law passed by Congress is reasonable , courts should allow it – which tips the balance toward the executive branch of government .
With executive power now being challenged in the courts like never in living memory , many in the legal community think the “ behemoth ” of Chevron deference , as Gorsuch described it , should be revisited and revised as well . And that ’ s in no small part because of Gorsuch ’ s own comments while serving on the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals .
“ Gorsuch is one of the most prominent , if not THE most prominent , lower court judges calling for a rethinking of Chevron , ” wrote Ilya Somin , a professor at George Mason University ’ s Antonin Scalia School of Law , in an email to the Monitor . “ His position is still a minority view . But the minority is growing . ”
While scaling back Chevron would certainly affect agencies , it could also have significant repercussions for President Donald Trump , who not only nominated executive power skeptic Gorsuch , but who has also continued to push the envelope of executive power himself .
“ Executive power issues are the most important that the [ Supreme ] Court will face in the next decade , ” wrote Ernest Young , a professor at Duke University Law School , in an email to the Monitor . “ The Executive must abide by statutory limits set by Congress , but if the Executive gets to define those limits ( and courts have to defer to its definitions ) then those limits are a lot less meaningful . ”
Put more bluntly by Professor Somin : “ Eliminating Chevron would help curb the dangerous expansion of executive power . It ’ s particularly desirable if you believe Trump and/or some other likely administration poses an unusually serious threat to the rule of law . ”
In the three decades since the Chevron ruling , courts have grown even more willing to defer to agency expertise and the notion that executive agencies are more politically accountable than the judiciary . Simultaneously , the overall power of the executive branch has been steadily expanding .
“ When an agency can overrule a judge on the law , that ’ s a separation of powers issue I think , maybe even an equal protection issue , ” Gorsuch said Tuesday during his hearings . “ I defer to experts when it comes to facts , but when it comes to questions of law , [ the Administrative Procedures Act ] entrusts courts to say what is the law . ”
Defenders of Chevron argue that deference to agencies is necessary because of their institutional expertise . They also argue that , for the government to run efficiently and effectively , agencies can ’ t be required to get court approval for every interpretation or reinterpretation of a law .
Chevron ’ s scope has become vast and complex , however , and criticisms of it are equally complex .
To which agency actions should Chevron deference apply , for example ? The 1984 Supreme Court case – involving Gorsuch ’ s mother , Anne , who was the head of the Environmental Protection Agency under President Reagan – concerned how the US Environmental Protection Agency should interpret a “ source of pollution ” to be regulated by the Clean Air Act . The justices ruled that courts should defer to the EPA interpretation instead of crafting one itself .
But should a court show equal deference to the actions of a low-level IRS employee responding to a minor concern ? And does the agency interpretation deserve deference immediately ? Or only after it has been in effect after a certain amount of time ?
Even the more liberal members of the Supreme Court have these kinds of nuanced concerns , says Professor Young .
“ Justice [ Stephen ] Breyer is generally a strong supporter of agencies but – as a lifelong [ Administrative ] Law professor ( he taught it to me back in 1992 ) – his views are very complex and there are situations where he would limit agencies significantly , ” he adds . “ Likewise , Justice Kagan is also an Ad Law professor in her former life and has complicated views . I don ’ t think this will turn out to be a left-right issue on the Court . ”
However , how people outside the court tend to view it does tend to be influenced by where they sit on the political spectrum .
“ People on the right have become skeptical of bureaucrats ’ claims to expertise because they perceive bureaucratic power as being exercised in overtly political ways , ” wrote Young . “ People on the left accuse the right of rejecting ‘ science ’ outright . ”
The Gorsuch hearings have given the Chevron debate the exposure Gorsuch himself may have only once dreamed of , but it has done so through a distinctly partisan lens that belies the complexity of the issue .
“ Reexamining Chevron is not about being anti- or pro-regulation . It 's about restoring constitutional separation of powers . It 's about ensuring that bureaucracy abides by the law no matter what its policy goals , ” said Senator Orrin Hatch ( R ) of Utah . “ This deference allows unaccountable bureaucrats to rewrite the law . ”
Democrats on the committee have voiced the concern that abandoning Chevron due to fear of the latter could result in the courts disregarding agency expertise .
“ Judicial action is often after the fact and backwards-looking , and regulation needs to keep up with the times , ” says Sen. Chris Coons ( D ) of Delaware in an interview with the Monitor . As for the legislature , “ unless Congress is going to start passing 5,000-page bills , we ’ re not going to have the time or competency to do [ the technical work of agencies ] in statute . ”
During Tuesday ’ s hearing , Sen. Amy Klobuchar ( D ) of Minnesota quoted Gorsuch ’ s “ behemoth ” concurrence before asking if he would vote to overturn Chevron as a Supreme Court justice .
“ My job as circuit judge is when I see a problem I tell my bosses about it , ” Gorsuch responded . “ If I was a justice I would try to approach it with as open a mind as possible . ”
Gorsuch ’ s views may be more specialized than some fear . The 10th Circuit rarely deals with Chevron cases , and the cases it does deal with are arguably far-removed from the big agency rulemakings that the deference was originally meant to apply to .
While it is clear that Gorsuch would be more skeptical of Chevron than many of his colleagues on the high court , “ What is far less clear , ” wrote Eric Citron for SCOTUSblog , “ is whether and how far Gorsuch ’ s outspoken skepticism extends to the far-more-central cases of agency rulemaking in which Chevron developed and in which it continues to play a core role in making federal regulation effective . ”","There are several elephants in the room where senators are grilling Judge Neil Gorsuch this week.

justice,The Daily Wire,2,https://www.dailywire.com/news/breaking-trump-campaign-sues-cnn,Trump Campaign Sues CNN,,,"On Friday , President Trump ’ s re-election campaign sued CNN , claiming the network had published false and defamatory statements by stating the campaign “ assessed the potential risks and benefits of again seeking Russia ’ s help in 2020 and has decided to leave that option on the table . ”
The senior legal advisor for the Trump campaign , Jenna Ellis , told Fox News :
The complaint alleges CNN was aware of the falsity at the time it published them but did so for the intentional purpose of hurting the campaign while misleading its own readers in the process … the campaign filed this lawsuit against CNN and the preceding suits against The New York Times and The Washington Post to hold the publishers accountable for their reckless false reporting and also to establish the truth .
The lawsuit states , “ The Campaign , through counsel , sent a written demand to CNN on February 25 , 2020 , to retract and apologize for the aforementioned false and defamatory statements . CNN refused . The Campaign therefore was left with no alternative but to file this lawsuit to : publicly establish the truth , properly inform CNN ’ s readers and audience ( and the rest of the world ) of the true facts , and seek appropriate remedies for the harm caused by CNN ’ s false reporting and failure and retract and apologize for it . ”
The lawsuit continues , “ CNN has engaged in a systematic pattern of bias against the Campaign , designed to maliciously interfere with and damage its reputation and ultimately cause the organization to fail … On or about June 13 , 2019 , CNN published an article on the www , CNN.com website entitled ‘ Soliciting dirt on your opponents from a foreign government is a crime . Mueller should have charged Trump campaign officials with it ’ by Larry Noble , ( the ‘ Defamatory Article ’ ) . ”
The lawsuit delineates why the article was false , citing examples such as then-Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders stating in August 2018 , “ Since the beginning of his administration , President Trump has implemented a whole-of-government approach to safeguard our nations ’ elections . The president has made it clear that his administration will not tolerate foreign interference in our elections from any nation-state or other dangerous actor . ”
Another example : The White House issuing a statement in September 2018 saying , “ The United States will not tolerate any form of foreign meddling in our elections. ” A third example : May 13 , 2019 : The White House said it would not use any information hacked or stolen by foreign adversaries in the 2020 election .
The lawsuit then clearly accuses CNN of bias , writing : “ It is not entirely surprising that CNN would publish such blatantly false statements against the Campaign . There is extensive evidence that CNN and its writer , Larry Noble , are extremely biased against the Campaign . This evidence includes , among other things , undercover video footage taken by the Project Veritas News Organization in which CNN staff members admit on camera that CNN ’ s coverage is extremely biased against the Campaign , the administration , and Republicans in general . ”
The lawsuit concludes , “ The Defamatory Article has forced , and will continue to force , the Campaign to expend funds on corrective advertisements and to otherwise publicize the fact that the Campaign is not seeking Russia ’ s help , nor leaving that ‘ option on the table ’ in the 2020 election campaign . The Campaign was damaged in an amount to be proven at trial , in the millions of dollars . ”","On Friday, President Trump’s re-election campaign sued CNN, claiming the network had published false and defamatory statements by stating the campaign “assessed the potential risks and benefits of again seeking Russia’s help in 2020 and has decided to leave that option on the table.”

And in general, there have been questions about just how involved Trump’s team was with Russia’s hacks of the emails of Democrats and the Clinton campaign.

Democrats responded to the report by calling on Sessions to recuse himself from any investigation into Trump’s ties to the Justice Department. And Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, called on Sessions to resign.

“[A]fter lying under oath to Congress about his own communications with the Russians, the attorney general must resign,” Pelosi said. “Sessions is not fit to serve as the top law enforcement officer of our country and must resign. There must be an independent, bipartisan, outside commission to investigate the Trump political, personal, and financial connections to the Russians.”

NEW YORK ( AP ) — The jury in Harvey Weinstein ’ s rape trial indicated Friday that it is deadlocked on the most serious charges against the once powerful Hollywood mogul , but the judge told the panel it must keep working .
In a note to the judge late in the fourth day of deliberations , jurors asked if it was permissible for them to be hung on one or both counts of predatory sexual assault while reaching a unanimous verdict on the other charges .

“ It is not uncommon for a jury to have difficulty initially in reaching a unanimous verdict , and it is not uncommon for a jury to believe that they will never be able to reach a unanimous verdict , ” Burke said , reading instructions to the jurors . “ But after further deliberations , most jurors are able to reach a unanimous verdict . ”
The jury posed its deadlock question in hypothetical fashion , writing : “ We the jury request to understand if we can be hung on ( Count ) 1 and/or ( Count ) 3 and unanimous on the other charges ? Thank you . ”
One reason for that phrasing could be that the verdict sheet — which lays out the charges — doesn ’ t include instructions for what to do if they can ’ t agree on a particular count , only how they ’ re supposed to proceed once they ’ ve reached a verdict of guilty or not guilty .

Law professor Cheryl Bader said the note suggests the jury is split on a key aspect of both predatory sexual assault counts — “ Sopranos ” actress Annabella Sciorra ’ s allegations that Weinstein attacked her in the mid-1990s — and that it is in unanimous agreement on the allegations by two other women — an aspiring actress who says he raped her in March 2013 and a former film and TV production assistant , Mimi Haleyi , who says he forcibly performed oral sex on her in March 2006 .

In all , Weinstein , 67 , is charged with five counts stemming from the allegations of Sciorra , the aspiring actress and Haleyi .
To convict Weinstein of a predatory sexual assault charge , jurors must agree on two things : that Weinstein raped or forcibly performed oral sex on Sciorra , as she alleges , and that he committed one of the other charged offenses .
The predatory sexual assault charge requires prosecutors to show that a defendant committed a prior rape or other sex crime , but doesn ’ t have the statue of limitation constraints that would bar Sciorra ’ s allegations from consideration on their own .

justice,InfoWars,2,https://www.infowars.com/sheriff-arpaio-why-is-obama-still-running-the-justice-dept/,Why Is Obama Still Running the Justice Department?,2017-08-10,Jerome Corsi,"WASHINGTON , D.C. – After being convicted of criminal misdemeanor contempt , former Maricopa Co. Sheriff Joe Arpaio continues to attack the Obama holdovers in the Trump Justice Department who seeking to imprison him for enforcing the very immigration laws President Trump has sworn to enforce .
“ Why is Barack Obama is still running the Trump Justice Department ? ” Arpaio asked ███.com in an exclusive interview . “ Ironically , this is a ‘ revenge prosecution ’ in which Obama-holdovers in the Justice Department are seeking to enforce a court order that socialist LaRaza lawyer Tom Perez imposed on me because I refused to make Maricopa County into a sanctuary for illegal immigrants . ”
The irony of the case is that the criminal misdemeanor contempt charge is being pressed against Arpaio by the Public Integrity Section ( PIN ) of the Criminal Division of the U.S. Department of Justice – the section within the Justice Department that holds exclusive jurisdiction over the prosecution of alleged criminal official misconduct , as well as over the prosecution of alleged judicial misconduct — a relevant fact in that the actions of District Court Judge Murray Snow have been called into question by Arpaio ’ s legal team .
“ How can the Public Integrity Section of the Justice Department prosecute me when all I did was to honestly enforce the immigration laws currently on the books ? ” Arpaio asked ███.com in an exclusive telephone interview .
“ The Public Integrity prosecutors who are still after me are all Obama hold-overs who went so far as to charge me under the wrong statute so they could deny me a jury trial , refusing to drop their open-borders amnesty agenda , ” he argued .
“ How is it that Attorney General Sessions ignored a letter Sheriff Arpaio ’ s attorneys had hand-delivered to his office , when all Sheriff Arpaio requested was that the Justice Department consider insisting the Public Integrity Section would allow hi my right as a U.S. citizen to a trial before a jury of my peers ? ” Arpaio asked .
“ It ’ s ironic that I ’ m being persecuted by Obama hold-overs Justice Department Public Integrity Section that thinks denying me a jury trial by erroneously using an inappropriate statute , even after being made aware of this by my attorneys , somehow doesn ’ t implicate them in official misconduct and the potential to be criminally prosecuted themselves , ” Arpaio insisted .
███.com has previously reported the case against Arpaio began with the 2007 traffic stop that resulted in the arrest of Ortega Melendres , a Mexican tourist who was a passenger in an automobile stopped in Cave Creek , Maricopa County .
Melendres charged the Maricopa County sheriff ’ s officers were “ fundamentally stopping brown-skinned people with the pretext of looking for criminals . ”
The case developed into a class action lawsuit that caught the attention of Eric Holder and Tom Perez , then in the Civil Rights division of the Obama Justice Department .
Arpaio , a target of the Obama administration for years because of his determination to enforce strictly existing immigration laws , was seen by Perez , acting under the orders of Eric Holder , as implementing in the Maricopa County Sheriff ’ s Office ( MCSO ) a “ systematic policy ” that set law enforcement rules and procedures to be intentionally discriminatory to the rights of Hispanics .
Perez began his legal career as a LaRaza attorney in Maryland . He currently is Chair of the Democratic National Committee , a major force in moving the Democratic Party in a hard-left direction .
Now at 85-years-old , after a distinguished career that includes service in the U.S. Army from 1950-1953 , service as a police officer in Washington , D.C. , and Las Vegas , Nevada , as well as working as a top federal drug enforcement officer in foreign countries and the United States . Arpaio , a former DEA narcotics agent and head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration , U.S. Department of Justice , for Arizona , faces criminal charges that could see him convicted to six-months in jail if found guilty .
Arpaio ’ s attorney , Mark Goldman , Goldman & Zillinger PLLC in Scottsdale , AZ , sent to Attorney General Sessions a letter dated June 22 , 2017 , that was requesting the Department of Justice to consider various pleas before the start of the bench trial then scheduled to begin on Monday , June 26 , 2017 , before U.S. District Judge Susan R. Bolton , in Phoenix , Arizona .
███.com has confirmed that several efforts were made to contact Attorney General Sessions directly and through trusted intermediaries in an effort to get Justice Department attention to Goldman ’ s letter .
███.com can also confirm that Attorney General Sessions was insolated within the Justice Department so that all attempts to communicate with him failed .
Ultimately , Goldman ’ s letter was ignored , and with the Justice Department ’ s failure to intervene in the case , Judge Bolton began the bench trial against Arpaio as originally scheduled .
“ The criminal contempt allegations stem from an alleged failure of the Maricopa County Sheriff ’ s Offices ( MCSO ) to comply with an Order of the Court ( preliminary injunction ) dated December 23 , 2011 , ” Goldman ’ s letter read .
“ This charge relates back to the prior Obama administration and a time when the Sheriff ’ s practices were in direct opposition to the Obama administration in regards to immigration policy , ” Goldman ’ s letter continued . “ The Sheriff was enforcing the law . The Obama administration appears to have been interested in doing the opposite for apparent political reasons . ”
In the letter , Goldman argued the Obama Justice Department allowed Arpaio to be charged with criminal contempt misdemeanor charges under the wrong statute , precisely because the statute of limitations on the correct statute had run out , and the incorrect statute allowed Judge Bolton to deny Arpaio the right to a jury trial .
“ In regards to other aspects of the prosecution , we request that you reconsider the DOJ ’ s prosecution of this matter because it was incorrectly brought under 18 U.S.C . Section 401 . Section 401 relates to a simple criminal contempt of a lawful order . The matter should have been brought under 18 U.S.C . Section 402 . Section 402 applies to contumacious conduct that is also a separate crime as more particularly described in the attached Petition . The allegations in this matter compel it to be prosecuted under 18 U.S.C . Section 402 that entitles the offender to a jury trial in accordance with 18 U.S.C . Section 3691 . Additionally , Section 402 offenses come with a one year statute of limitations .
“ Given that the matter was not charged under the correct statute , and consequently the Department of Justice has deprived Sheriff Arpaio of his jury trial right and the applicable statute of limitations , in the interest of justice we request that you move the Court to dismiss the criminal contempt proceedings or , at the very least , move the Court to stay the trial pending a full review of this matter by your office .
“ Time is of the essence for the reason that this matter . ”
Goldman also argued the Obama Justice Department had timed various announcement coincident with Arizona voting deadlines in 2016 , so as to influence voters to defeat Arpaio ’ s bid for re-election – an effort that is in direct conflict with DOJ policies instituted by Eric Holder .
“ The announcements had an undeniable effect upon Sheriff Arpaio ’ s campaign to be elected to a seventh term in office , ” Goldman wrote . “ The impact on Sheriff Arpaio ’ s re-election campaign is clear . He is no longer Sheriff . ”
Largely as a result of the adverse publicity from facing criminal contempt charges , Arpaio lost on Nov. 8 , 2016 , his seventh bid to be elected Maricopa County Sheriff .
The challenger , Paul Penzone , a Democrat and a former Phoenix police sergeant who lost to Arpaio in 2012 , won the sheriff ’ s election in 2016 only after the Justice Department under Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced criminal charges would be brought against Arpaio . This , combined with George Soros backing Penzone ’ s campaign positioned to Arizona ’ s growing Hispanic population .
Throughout the entire case , the Obama DOJ pursued Arpaio with a vengeance .
On Jan. 5 , 2012 , when the Department of Justice dropped the initial criminal case against Arpaio in favor of pursuing the civil case , the Department of Justice sent the author an email , explaining , “ If MCSO wants to debate the facts rather than fixing the problems stated in our findings , we will do so by way of litigation . ”
According to information provided the author by a credible whistleblower , while the Department of Justice was prosecuting Arpaio from 2008 to 2010 , the National Security Agency conducted electronic surveillance of the various Arizona-based federal judges on the case , as well as on Arpaio , and on the Maricopa County Sheriff ’ s Office .
At the same time , Department of Justice attorneys under the direction of Attorney General Eric Holder maintained an on-going telephone back-channel discussion with the federal judge assigned to handle the case .
That the Department of Justice conspired to defeat Arpaio is suggested by the timing of his criminal indictment .
In mid-October 2016 , with the election approximately three weeks away , the Justice Department announced that lawyers were preparing to file criminal contempt of court charges against Arpaio for his alleged violation of Judge Stone ’ s orders in the Melendres case .
Then , on Nov. 4 , 2016 , four days before the election , Politico reported Soros had contributed over $ 3 million to a Soros-funded PAC , Maricopa Strong , to defeat Arpaio .
On July 31 , Judge Bolton found that Arpaio was guilty of misdemeanor criminal contempt .
As ███.com has previously reported , Arpaio ’ s attorney Mark Goldman explained to ███.com in an exclusive telephone interview and follow-up email that the judge in the case , U.S. District Susan R. Bolton , was so biased against Arpaio that she could have written her opinion before the trial even started , stating her prejudice from the start that Arpaio was guilty of misdemeanor civil contempt guilty conviction .
Arpaio ’ s attorneys are in the process of appealing the misdemeanor criminal court conviction that has the possibility of forcing him to serve jail time , depending upon the sentencing order Judge Snow is expected to order on Oct. 5 , 2017 , after the DOJ probation department prepares its presentence investigation report .
Arpaio still has a petition for a writ of mandamus before the Supreme Court , asking the Supreme Court to intervene directly in the case with a ruling that Arpaio ’ s request for a jury trial should have been granted .","WASHINGTON, D.C. – After being convicted of criminal misdemeanor contempt, former Maricopa Co.

Obama and Lynch plan to oust Arpaio from office

Largely as a result of the adverse publicity from facing criminal contempt charges, Arpaio lost on Nov. 8, 2016, his seventh bid to be elected Maricopa County Sheriff.

The challenger, Paul Penzone, a Democrat and a former Phoenix police sergeant who lost to Arpaio in 2012, won the sheriff’s election in 2016 only after the Justice Department under Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced criminal charges would be brought against Arpaio. This, combined with George Soros backing Penzone’s campaign positioned to Arizona’s growing Hispanic population.

Throughout the entire case, the Obama DOJ pursued Arpaio with a vengeance.

Then, on Nov. 4, 2016, four days before the election, Politico reported Soros had contributed over $3 million to a Soros-funded PAC, Maricopa Strong, to defeat Arpaio.

Obama holdovers in DOJ seek prison time for Arpaio

On July 31, Judge Bolton found that Arpaio was guilty of misdemeanor criminal contempt.

As Infowars.com has previously reported, Arpaio’s attorney Mark Goldman explained to Infowars.com in an exclusive telephone interview and follow-up email that the judge in the case, U.S. District Susan R. Bolton, was so biased against Arpaio that she could have written her opinion before the trial even started, stating her prejudice from the start that Arpaio was guilty of misdemeanor civil contempt guilty conviction.

Arpaio’s attorneys are in the process of appealing the misdemeanor criminal court conviction that has the possibility of forcing him to serve jail time, depending upon the sentencing order Judge Snow is expected to order on Oct. 5, 2017, after the DOJ probation department prepares its presentence investigation report.

Arpaio still has a petition for a writ of mandamus before the Supreme Court, asking the Supreme Court to intervene directly in the case with a ruling that Arpaio’s request for a jury trial should have been granted.

The lawsuit combats California ’ s `` sanctuary state '' laws that shield immigrants from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement . Attorney General Jeff Sessions is expected to make a formal announcement Wednesday at a California Peace Officers ’ Association event in Sacramento , the California capital .
“ The Department of Justice and the Trump administration are going to fight these unjust , unfair , and unconstitutional policies that have been imposed on you , ” Sessions says in prepared remarks for the event . “ We are fighting to make your jobs safer and to help you reduce crime in America . And I believe that we are going to win . ”
The lawsuit is the latest move under the Trump administration to crack down on sanctuary cities . Under Trump , DOJ has tried a mix of political and financial pressure against sanctuary cities , threatening to cut off federal law enforcement grants unless cities agree to identify and hold suspected immigration offenders .
More : DOJ threatens 'sanctuary cities ' with subpoenas , escalating Trump 's immigration enforcement campaign
Related : In speech to mayors , Trump says sanctuary cities are the 'best friends of gangs and cartels '
The suit is coming now because California has just passed through the department 's review process , officials said . Other cities and states with sanctuary laws are still under review . The 23 sanctuary cities that were hit with a subpoena by Sessions have responded and are being reviewed on a rolling basis , officials said .
California 's laws are being addressed because they also are new , were widely seen in the media and go farther than other states ' laws , officials said .
The complaint names state laws AB 450 , SB 54 and AB 103 and alleges that each was created to impede existing immigration laws .
• AB 450 prohibits private employers from cooperating with federal immigration officials and requires that private employers notify employees in advance of a potential worksite enforcement inspection . DOJ claims that this forces California employers to be caught between state and federal law . Business owners could be fined $ 2,000 to $ 10,000 for failing to comply with AB 450 .

The Department of Justice is suing California over three state statutes that federal officials say interfere with their immigration authority.

The lawsuit combats California’s ""sanctuary state"" laws that shield immigrants from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Attorney General Jeff Sessions is expected to make a formal announcement Wednesday at a California Peace Officers’ Association event in Sacramento, the California capital.

“The Department of Justice and the Trump administration are going to fight these unjust, unfair, and unconstitutional policies that have been imposed on you,” Sessions says in prepared remarks for the event. “We are fighting to make your jobs safer and to help you reduce crime in America. And I believe that we are going to win.”

The lawsuit is the latest move under the Trump administration to crack down on sanctuary cities. Under Trump, DOJ has tried a mix of political and financial pressure against sanctuary cities, threatening to cut off federal law enforcement grants unless cities agree to identify and hold suspected immigration offenders.

The suit is coming now because California has just passed through the department's review process, officials said. Other cities and states with sanctuary laws are still under review. The 23 sanctuary cities that were hit with a subpoena by Sessions have responded and are being reviewed on a rolling basis, officials said.

California's laws are being addressed because they also are new, were widely seen in the media and go farther than other states' laws, officials said.

The complaint names state laws AB 450, SB 54 and AB 103 and alleges that each was created to impede existing immigration laws.

• AB 450 prohibits private employers from cooperating with federal immigration officials and requires that private employers notify employees in advance of a potential worksite enforcement inspection. DOJ claims that this forces California employers to be caught between state and federal law. Business owners could be fined $2,000 to $10,000 for failing to comply with AB 450.

• SB 54 prevents local law enforcement from providing information to federal authorities about the release date of undocumented immigrants who are in their custody and bans the transfer of these criminal immigrants to federal custody. This breaks federal law that pertains to communication between government agencies and the Immigration and Naturalization Service, DOJ officials said.

• AB 103 imposes a state-run inspection and review of the federal detention of immigrants held in facilities pursuant to federal contracts and includes a review of immigration processes and the circumstances in which immigrants were apprehended. This review applies only to facilities with civil immigration detainees. The law seeks to regulate federal immigration detention, according to the complaint, which is not allowed under the Constitution.

“Our duty at the Department of Homeland Security is to enforce and uphold the nation’s security laws as passed by the U.S. Congress and signed by the President,” Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said in a statement. “California has chosen to purposefully contradict the will and responsibility of the Congress to to protect our homeland.”

California Gov. Jerry Brown slammed the Trump administration and called Sessions' legal maneuvering a political stunt.

""At a time of unprecedented political turmoil, Jeff Sessions has come to California to further divide and polarize America,"" Brown said on Twitter, adding: ""Jeff, these political stunts may be the norm in Washington, but they don’t work here. SAD!!!""

Brown and California Attorney General Xavier Becerra held a press conference in Sacramento at the same time as Sessions' speech, to discuss Sessions' decision to sue California.

DOJ cites the 1974 Supreme Court case Arizona v. United States as precedent for their case. In that case, the court ruled that only parts of Arizona’s immigration law would be allowed to take effect.

Baltimore is . . . not great. It has the second-highest murder rate (“non-negligent homicide,” in the nomenclature of the FBI) in the country, behind St. Louis. It has some of the worst-performing public schools in the nation. The city’s mayor recently resigned in disgrace after a financial scandal. It is 63 percent African American.

Owsley County, Ky., is . . . not great. It is the poorest county in the United States. It has the second-highest level of child poverty in the country. Almost a quarter of the population under the age of 65 is classified as having a disability. It is 98 percent white. It is an overwhelmingly Republican county.

A response to Eric Posner

You’ll be relieved to learn that we no longer need to listen to the wisdom of the Founders, in part because they wore breeches and wigs. Their style of dress undermines the relevance of their thought.

At least that’s what University of Chicago law professor Eric Posner says today in the New York Times.

The purpose of his sartorial rant is a defense of the administrative state, the burgeoning bureaucratic beast that is consuming America’s lawmaking functions and all too often rendering Congress an afterthought.

This term, the Supreme Court is considering two cases that could roll back some small part of the executive branch’s regulatory discretion, and Posner rallies to the presidency’s defense. He attacks an allegedly “reactionary” Supreme Court that’s focused on the “legalistic” constitutional structure, as opposed to his preferred regulatory regime.

In other words, he looks at today’s immense executive branch — and the breathtaking amount of power granted to unelected bureaucrats — and says, “Yes, please.”

Here’s how he frames the legal dispute. After noting the growth of regulatory agencies during the New Deal, he says this:

The New Deal agencies initially encountered resistance from the Supreme Court, which was then, like now, a reactionary institution that frowned on novelty. For one thing, when agencies issue regulations, they make law, which was the traditional prerogative of Congress. Moreover, the agencies were mostly overseen by the White House, which is not supposed to make law. And Congress also gave many regulatory agencies some autonomy — protecting staff from removal, for example — that seemed to infringe on the president’s authority to supervise the executive branch. Eventually, common sense prevailed over these legalistic objections. Congress itself lacked the capacity to engage in the detailed regulation that is necessary to keep a modern economy humming while protecting workers and consumers. Agencies were needed. The executive branch was the sensible place to house agencies because the agencies combined both policymaking and enforcement functions. And agencies need some protection from political meddling. [Emphasis added.]

Right there, in two paragraphs, Posner summed up key differences between originalists and their opponents. The originalist looks at the text, history, and structure of the Constitution and evaluates legislation in light of that law. Too many progressives look at the same words on the same page, and respond with “Nah, there’s a better idea.”

Notice Posner’s objection to the Court’s constitutionalism. It’s about “common sense.” It’s about what’s “necessary” for the modern economy. But federal judges don’t sit as courts of common sense. They are not qualified to devise the ideal American system for economic growth.

Posner notes that a number of Supreme Court justices have expressed skepticism about the constitutionality of a number of aspects of the administrative state. Yet rather than deal seriously with their objections — or seriously with the reasons for the Founders’ decisions — Posner locates conservative objections in a wistful longing for the past:

The modern conservative jurisprudence is an exercise in nostalgia, a yearning for pre-New Deal America when, supposedly, government was less oppressive and people were freer than they are today. You can see this nostalgia in the homilies to olden times in Justices Gorsuch’s and Kavanaugh’s lectures — and their insistence that answers to today’s challenges can be found in a theory of government invented in the 18th century by men wearing breeches and powdered wigs.

You can almost feel the condescension. This is the legal academic’s equivalent of the Monty Python sneer that “Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government.” Those Founders looked funny. They wore old clothes.

Perhaps — just perhaps — there are enduring reasons for the separation of powers. Perhaps concentrating legislative power in Congress — the branch of government closest to the people — helps protect liberty and ensure democratic accountability. But rather than fully answer Posner myself, I’ll defer to Justice Neil Gorsuch, who articulated better than I can just a few of the problems with excessive legal deference (the infamous Chevron doctrine) to the administrative state:

An increasing number of Americans — on both sides of the aisle — are beginning to understand that congressional impotence is harmful to American democracy.

It’s expanding the presidency and the courts outside of their intended boundaries, and our very system is under strain. When designing a national government, there is more at stake than the efficiency of economic regulation or the expertise of any given regulator.

So, no, it is not a matter of “common sense” that we continue down this bureaucratic path. No, it’s not a “sham” to argue that Congress — not the president — should make American law. It’s a serious system designed by serious people.

( Tom Williams/Pool via Reuters )
Political process can give progressives only some of what they want .
Earlier today , I was reading our friend John Yoo on the question of whether the Constitution forbids discrimination on the basis of sex . It doesn ’ t . You can comb the document as carefully as you like , and there isn ’ t anything in there about that . Feminists have long implicitly acknowledged that , hence their pursuit of a constitutional amendment prohibiting it . ( Most versions of the so-called equal-rights amendment would do a good deal more than prohibit discrimination . ) But the Constitution ’ s silence on the question has not prevented the Supreme Court from determining , ex nihilo , that the Constitution does somewhere contain a prohibition against sexual discrimination , albeit one written in invisible ink known only to the eyes of the initiated .
The point of originalism . . . is not whether the right in question is good or bad , but which institution of government should make the decision . If you believe , as I do , that discrimination based on sexual orientation is not prohibited by the Constitution , that does not end the matter . The Constitution simply moves the issue to the political branches of the federal government and the states . The president and Congress can ban such discrimination by the federal government — as it recently did with the repeal of “ don ’ t ask , don ’ t tell ” — and the states can make up their own minds .
If indeed the current society has come to different views , that ’ s fine . You do not need the Constitution to reflect the wishes of the current society . Certainly the Constitution does not require discrimination on the basis of sex . The only issue is whether it prohibits it . It doesn ’ t . Nobody ever thought that that ’ s what it meant . Nobody ever voted for that . If the current society wants to outlaw discrimination by sex , hey , we have things called legislatures , and they enact things called laws . You don ’ t need a constitution to keep things up-to-date . All you need is a legislature and a ballot box . You don ’ t like the death penalty anymore ? That ’ s fine . You want a right to abortion ? There ’ s nothing in the Constitution about that . But that doesn ’ t mean you can not prohibit it . Persuade your fellow citizens it ’ s a good idea and pass a law . That ’ s what democracy is all about . It ’ s not about nine superannuated judges who have been there too long , imposing these demands on society .
With Brett Kavanaugh confirmed to the Supreme Court , many conservatives would say that the Court now has a 5-4 majority of originalist justices ( Chief Justice Roberts may rightly be regarded with some suspicion on that ) ; many of our progressive friends instead would insist that what the Court has is a 5-4 majority of right-wing justices , justices who are too privileged , too male , and too white ( Representative Bennie Thompson , a Mississippi Democrat , denounced Justice Thomas as an “ Uncle Tom ” on New Nation of Islam radio ) to reflect the needs of an increasingly diverse American society with its own emerging and evolving sense of justice . That was the basis of President Obama ’ s declaration that he wanted judges guided by “ empathy ” rather than by anything so narrow and fusty as the law . ( Never mind that “ empathy ” is a literary device ; it is a word that , like “ gender , ” has made its way into the lexicon of a civil discourse that no longer distinguishes rhetoric from real things , conflating words about life with words about words . ) Of course , all that is really just a moralistic way of saying : “ We want justices who are aligned with us politically and culturally , and who will give us what we want , irrespective of what the law says . ”
Given the new composition of the Court , progressives have an opportunity to rethink that position .
The Constitution is silent on many questions : sexual discrimination , as Yoo notes , but also abortion , homosexuality , irreversible sex-reassignment procedures for minors , and many of the other so-called social issues . The conservative position on the process by which these questions should be addressed ( as distinct from the substance of the questions themselves ) is that the legislatures must speak where the Constitution is silent . That is not a particularly radical view . ( It is not nearly so radical as , say , President Obama ’ s insistence that the character of the law is mystically dependent upon some agreed-upon set of demographic features associated with those who preside over federal courts . ) A more scrupulously originalist ( or textualist ) approach would have prevented some bad decisions with bad outcomes ( Roe ) but — as conservatives should frankly admit — some bad decisions with good outcomes , Brown v. Board among them .
As a matter of historical ( and counterhistorical ) debate , the question of Brown and similar decisions presents us with two main avenues of inquiry : Conservatives may rightly point out that the nation probably would be far better off if the matter of segregation had been handled mainly through ordinary legislative channels , especially in the state legislatures ; relying on democratic processes produces more social buy-in , less division , and more organic accommodation of differing views — and the latter is important inasmuch as the different views in question were not limited to white supremacy vs. racial equality but also included enduring questions about the nature and structure of our federal enterprise , the relative role of the federal and state governments , and more . Fair-minded progressives might concede all that and yet still insist that waiting on democratic remedies would have meant inflicting injustice on ( in the case of Brown ) another generation of vulnerable children who were being victimized in a despicable way in the service of a contemptible philosophy . Without Supreme Court intervention , they say , it is entirely possible that many of those evils would still be with us . And progressives are not wrong about that — it just isn ’ t a legally or constitutionally relevant consideration .
The Left and the Right face the same quandary and the same temptation . Where the Constitution is silent , we have two choices : We may address the question through the political process , or we may rely upon the Supreme Court to invent a constitutional pretext facilitating our desired policy outcome . Progressives have long relied on the latter approach ; given the likely direction of the Court in coming years , one might think that they would be rethinking their commitment to judicial activism . But they are not . Instead , their big ideas at the moment are court-packing and legislature-packing , or else impeaching a few of the justices they do not like if and when they should again control enough Senate seats to achieve that .
Why not rely on the political process ? Why insist on inventing constitutional mandates that do not exist — especially when sticking to that approach is more likely for the moment to produce conservative outcomes rather than progressive ones ?
To understand why that is requires understanding the basis of the progressive commitment to judicial activism . That commitment is not only ( or even chiefly ) about achieving policy outcomes that would be more difficult to secure through ordinary political means . Judicial activism is about social domination , which progressives seek and covet as an end in itself independent of the particular policy outcomes associated with it . In a society as prosperous as ours , the most desirable goods are metaphysical ones : status , power , privileges , rank , approval , and other fringe benefits of the soul . ( Airlines , bless them , may be the worst-run businesses in the world , but they are bracingly honest about the fact that some customers have status and some do not . Status is from the Latin word meaning standing , and if you want to know your status at the check-in counter , your standing determines physically where you stand , the metaphorical and the literal united at last . ) A great part of the Left ’ s social politics are not about policy questions at all — they are about the enjoyment that one derives from the act of humiliating those one hates . Hence the Left ’ s mandatory-participation model of politics : Abortion will not only be legal , but those of you who object to it will pay for it and thus participate in it ; you nuns , elderly and celibate though you may be , will purchase and subsidize contraception to which you object ; you critics of global-warming policies will be investigated as criminals and legally punished for your dissent ; etc . Social domination is a consumption good , the psychological equivalent of getting a massage . And that is why it is not enough for the Left to join forces with like-minded conservatives such as John Yoo when an opportunity presents itself , as it did in the matter of homosexual marriage .
To win an election is not sufficient — it is much more satisfying to be revealed as one of the chosen by capital-H History , which progressives always are declaring themselves to be on the right side of . ( One of the funny consequences of that is that important progressives such as President Wilson and Senator Russell are read out of the progressives ’ historical account of their own movement because of the horrible racial views they held . ) To win a political victory is one thing — a relatively petty thing — but to have one ’ s political will and sense of personal identity revealed as a constituent of the foundational bedrock of the nation , blessed by History itself , is a different kind of thing altogether . And that is what the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court threatened to take away from the Left , which is why their campaign against him was conducted with such hysteria . Some conservatives noted that it resembled religious fervor , but it did not resemble that : It was not something like religious fervor but actual religious fervor , the thing itself .
Which is to say , the Left will not take up originalism because the political process can give progressives only some of what they want . Democracy may provide the policy outcomes they desire , but progressives desire much more than that . They desire domination for its own sake , as a source of pleasure , and that domination grows more desirable the more closely the instrument of domination resembles a religious body : e.g. , wise men in black robes interpreting an occult text inscrutable to the uninitiated , who , being profane and outside the clerisy , can not read between its lines . Sicut erat in principio , et nunc , et semper , et in sæcula sæculorum .","Brett Kavanaugh is sworn in prior to testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee, September 27, 2018. (Tom Williams/Pool via Reuters)

Political process can give progressives only some of what they want.

Earlier today, I was reading our friend John Yoo on the question of whether the Constitution forbids discrimination on the basis of sex. It doesn’t. You can comb the document as carefully as you like, and there isn’t anything in there about that. Feminists have long implicitly acknowledged that, hence their pursuit of a constitutional amendment prohibiting it. (Most versions of the so-called equal-rights amendment would do a good deal more than prohibit discrimination.) But the Constitution’s silence on the question has not prevented the Supreme Court from determining, ex nihilo, that the Constitution does somewhere contain a prohibition against sexual discrimination, albeit one written in invisible ink known only to the eyes of the initiated.

As usual, Yoo is a model of clarity:

The point of originalism . . . is not whether the right in question is good or bad, but which institution of government should make the decision. If you believe, as I do, that discrimination based on sexual orientation is not prohibited by the Constitution, that does not end the matter. The Constitution simply moves the issue to the political branches of the federal government and the states. The president and Congress can ban such discrimination by the federal government — as it recently did with the repeal of “don’t ask, don’t tell” — and the states can make up their own minds.

Yoo quotes Antonin Scalia on the same question:

If indeed the current society has come to different views, that’s fine. You do not need the Constitution to reflect the wishes of the current society. Certainly the Constitution does not require discrimination on the basis of sex. The only issue is whether it prohibits it. It doesn’t. Nobody ever thought that that’s what it meant. Nobody ever voted for that. If the current society wants to outlaw discrimination by sex, hey, we have things called legislatures, and they enact things called laws. You don’t need a constitution to keep things up-to-date. All you need is a legislature and a ballot box. You don’t like the death penalty anymore? That’s fine. You want a right to abortion? There’s nothing in the Constitution about that. But that doesn’t mean you cannot prohibit it. Persuade your fellow citizens it’s a good idea and pass a law. That’s what democracy is all about. It’s not about nine superannuated judges who have been there too long, imposing these demands on society.

With Brett Kavanaugh confirmed to the Supreme Court, many conservatives would say that the Court now has a 5-4 majority of originalist justices (Chief Justice Roberts may rightly be regarded with some suspicion on that); many of our progressive friends instead would insist that what the Court has is a 5-4 majority of right-wing justices, justices who are too privileged, too male, and too white (Representative Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, denounced Justice Thomas as an “Uncle Tom” on New Nation of Islam radio) to reflect the needs of an increasingly diverse American society with its own emerging and evolving sense of justice. That was the basis of President Obama’s declaration that he wanted judges guided by “empathy” rather than by anything so narrow and fusty as the law. (Never mind that “empathy” is a literary device; it is a word that, like “gender,” has made its way into the lexicon of a civil discourse that no longer distinguishes rhetoric from real things, conflating words about life with words about words.) Of course, all that is really just a moralistic way of saying: “We want justices who are aligned with us politically and culturally, and who will give us what we want, irrespective of what the law says.”

Given the new composition of the Court, progressives have an opportunity to rethink that position.

The Constitution is silent on many questions: sexual discrimination, as Yoo notes, but also abortion, homosexuality, irreversible sex-reassignment procedures for minors, and many of the other so-called social issues. The conservative position on the process by which these questions should be addressed (as distinct from the substance of the questions themselves) is that the legislatures must speak where the Constitution is silent. That is not a particularly radical view. (It is not nearly so radical as, say, President Obama’s insistence that the character of the law is mystically dependent upon some agreed-upon set of demographic features associated with those who preside over federal courts.) A more scrupulously originalist (or textualist) approach would have prevented some bad decisions with bad outcomes (Roe) but — as conservatives should frankly admit — some bad decisions with good outcomes, Brown v. Board among them.

As a matter of historical (and counterhistorical) debate, the question of Brown and similar decisions presents us with two main avenues of inquiry: Conservatives may rightly point out that the nation probably would be far better off if the matter of segregation had been handled mainly through ordinary legislative channels, especially in the state legislatures; relying on democratic processes produces more social buy-in, less division, and more organic accommodation of differing views — and the latter is important inasmuch as the different views in question were not limited to white supremacy vs. racial equality but also included enduring questions about the nature and structure of our federal enterprise, the relative role of the federal and state governments, and more. Fair-minded progressives might concede all that and yet still insist that waiting on democratic remedies would have meant inflicting injustice on (in the case of Brown) another generation of vulnerable children who were being victimized in a despicable way in the service of a contemptible philosophy. Without Supreme Court intervention, they say, it is entirely possible that many of those evils would still be with us. And progressives are not wrong about that — it just isn’t a legally or constitutionally relevant consideration.

The Left and the Right face the same quandary and the same temptation. Where the Constitution is silent, we have two choices: We may address the question through the political process, or we may rely upon the Supreme Court to invent a constitutional pretext facilitating our desired policy outcome. Progressives have long relied on the latter approach; given the likely direction of the Court in coming years, one might think that they would be rethinking their commitment to judicial activism. But they are not. Instead, their big ideas at the moment are court-packing and legislature-packing, or else impeaching a few of the justices they do not like if and when they should again control enough Senate seats to achieve that.

Why not rely on the political process? Why insist on inventing constitutional mandates that do not exist — especially when sticking to that approach is more likely for the moment to produce conservative outcomes rather than progressive ones?

To understand why that is requires understanding the basis of the progressive commitment to judicial activism. That commitment is not only (or even chiefly) about achieving policy outcomes that would be more difficult to secure through ordinary political means. Judicial activism is about social domination, which progressives seek and covet as an end in itself independent of the particular policy outcomes associated with it. In a society as prosperous as ours, the most desirable goods are metaphysical ones: status, power, privileges, rank, approval, and other fringe benefits of the soul. (Airlines, bless them, may be the worst-run businesses in the world, but they are bracingly honest about the fact that some customers have status and some do not. Status is from the Latin word meaning standing, and if you want to know your status at the check-in counter, your standing determines physically where you stand, the metaphorical and the literal united at last.) A great part of the Left’s social politics are not about policy questions at all — they are about the enjoyment that one derives from the act of humiliating those one hates. Hence the Left’s mandatory-participation model of politics: Abortion will not only be legal, but those of you who object to it will pay for it and thus participate in it; you nuns, elderly and celibate though you may be, will purchase and subsidize contraception to which you object; you critics of global-warming policies will be investigated as criminals and legally punished for your dissent; etc. Social domination is a consumption good, the psychological equivalent of getting a massage. And that is why it is not enough for the Left to join forces with like-minded conservatives such as John Yoo when an opportunity presents itself, as it did in the matter of homosexual marriage.

To win an election is not sufficient — it is much more satisfying to be revealed as one of the chosen by capital-H History, which progressives always are declaring themselves to be on the right side of. (One of the funny consequences of that is that important progressives such as President Wilson and Senator Russell are read out of the progressives’ historical account of their own movement because of the horrible racial views they held.) To win a political victory is one thing — a relatively petty thing — but to have one’s political will and sense of personal identity revealed as a constituent of the foundational bedrock of the nation, blessed by History itself, is a different kind of thing altogether. And that is what the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court threatened to take away from the Left, which is why their campaign against him was conducted with such hysteria. Some conservatives noted that it resembled religious fervor, but it did not resemble that: It was not something like religious fervor but actual religious fervor, the thing itself.

Advertisement

Which is to say, the Left will not take up originalism because the political process can give progressives only some of what they want. Democracy may provide the policy outcomes they desire, but progressives desire much more than that. They desire domination for its own sake, as a source of pleasure, and that domination grows more desirable the more closely the instrument of domination resembles a religious body: e.g., wise men in black robes interpreting an occult text inscrutable to the uninitiated, who, being profane and outside the clerisy, cannot read between its lines.

The nation 's top legal officer is set to go before Congress on Tuesday to try to defuse a bomb that the former FBI director dropped into his lap .
Attorney General Jeff Sessions is scheduled to appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee less than one week after James Comey told the committee he could not discuss openly certain information about Sessions ' recusal from the investigation into Russia 's election meddling last year .
Comey also told the committee that Sessions had agreed to clear the Oval Office along with other top administration leaders , after which Trump asked Comey to lay off the investigation into former national security adviser Mike Flynn .
Senators want to get Sessions ' take on all this . His strategy : Bring it on .
`` The attorney general has requested that this hearing be public , '' said spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores . `` He believes it is important for the American people to hear the truth directly from him and looks forward to answering the committee 's questions tomorrow . ''
Here 's a look at five questions that members likely want to ask Sessions as he both defends himself and potentially helps his boss — the president — try to preserve some headway in political seas that continue roiling in the aftermath of Hurricane Comey .
The attorney general said early on that as someone who had been a campaign partner and advocate for the president , he felt it was n't appropriate for him to be in charge of any inquiry into how it had been conducted .
`` I should not be involved in investigating a campaign I had a role in , '' Sessions said at the Justice Department on the day he announced his decision .
But there are also questions about meetings that Sessions had with Russia 's ambassador to the U.S. , Sergey Kislyak , who has emerged as a key figure in the question of whether any Trump associates had ties to Russian officials . Sessions and Kislyak met at least twice last year .
Sessions has denied that any of his contact with Kislyak involved discussions about the Trump campaign , and he has explained that as a member of the Senate , as he then was , he dealt often with foreign emissaries as part of his normal work .
Comey 's hints to the Senate Intelligence Committee , however , suggest that he knew of more contacts or other relationships that made him and the rest of the top FBI leaders expect that Sessions would take himself out of the game .
Whatever they are , they 're `` facts that I ca n't discuss in an open setting , '' Comey said .
`` I have decided to recuse myself from any existing or future investigations of any matters related in any way to the campaigns for President of the United States , '' Sessions said in a statement on March 2 . `` I have taken no actions regarding any such matters , to the extent they exist . ''
And yet Sessions took a huge action on May 9 : He signed a letter , with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein , recommending that Trump fire Comey as FBI director . Trump cited the Justice Department leaders ' recommendation in his now-famous note to Comey concluding that `` you are not able to effectively lead '' the FBI .
What 's more , Trump reportedly tasked Sessions with coming up with the case for firing Comey . How could an attorney general who said he would take himself out of the Russia investigation play a role in firing the officer who was leading it ?
And if Sessions was involved with that decision , in what other ways might he have continued to be involved with the Russia inquiry even after announcing that he would n't take part ?
3 . Did Sessions know what Trump planned to ask Comey in the closed meeting ?
Comey painted a clear picture for the Senate Intelligence Committee : At the conclusion of a meeting with several people in the Oval Office , Trump — in Comey 's telling — cleared the room .
`` As the participants started to leave the Oval Office , the attorney general lingered by my chair but the president thanked him and said he wanted to speak only with me , '' Comey wrote in his statement . `` The last person to leave was Jared Kushner [ Trump 's son-in-law and close adviser ] , who also stood by my chair and exchanged pleasantries with me . The president then excused him , saying he wanted to speak with me . ''
That 's when , in Comey 's telling , Trump made the ask about the inquiry into the former national security adviser : `` I hope you can let this go . ''
Did Sessions know beforehand that the president planned to take aside the FBI director and appeal to him to lay off Flynn ? If so , had the president asked him beforehand in some other time or place ?
And if not , why did Sessions agree to leave the president alone with someone who was technically his subordinate — the FBI is part of the Justice Department — for a discussion that would have been within his purview ?
Sessions ' answers about this and another encounter that Comey has described ( more on that below ) could be some of the most significant of the hearing on Tuesday . If he confirms there was a meeting at which he and Kushner were asked to leave , it could bolster Comey 's account . But if he challenges this story strongly , it helps Trump 's narrative that Comey did n't tell the Senate the truth .
If there is no independent account of what might have taken place inside the White House — in the form of a recording system that might have kept `` tapes '' of the discussions that took place , as Trump once suggested on Twitter — it boils down to Trump 's and Sessions ' word against Comey 's .
Trump told reporters Friday he 'd have something to say about the tapes `` soon , '' but White House officials have n't given a solid answer about whether they exist — though members of Congress have called for them as evidence if they do . White House spokesman Sean Spicer did n't address questions about potential recordings on Monday .
4 . Did Sessions ever talk to Trump about the private meeting with Comey ?
Comey told members of Congress that he appealed to Sessions after Trump 's private request : Do n't let that happen again . Do n't leave us alone like that . You , the attorney general , have to be between the president and me .
California Sen. Kamala Harris asked Comey for more detail about this scene when he appeared last week . What did Sessions say , she asked — how did he respond ?
`` I do n't remember real clearly , '' Comey answered . `` I have a recollection of him just kind of looking at me — and there 's a danger here I 'm projecting onto him , so this may be a faulty memory — but I kind of got that his body language gave me the sense , like , 'What am I going to do ?

The nation's top legal officer is set to go before Congress on Tuesday to try to defuse a bomb that the former FBI director dropped into his lap.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions is scheduled to appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee less than one week after James Comey told the committee he could not discuss openly certain information about Sessions' recusal from the investigation into Russia's election meddling last year.

Comey also told the committee that Sessions had agreed to clear the Oval Office along with other top administration leaders, after which Trump asked Comey to lay off the investigation into former national security adviser Mike Flynn.

Senators want to get Sessions' take on all this. His strategy: Bring it on.

""The attorney general has requested that this hearing be public,"" said spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores. ""He believes it is important for the American people to hear the truth directly from him and looks forward to answering the committee's questions tomorrow.""

Here's a look at five questions that members likely want to ask Sessions as he both defends himself and potentially helps his boss — the president — try to preserve some headway in political seas that continue roiling in the aftermath of Hurricane Comey.

1. What's the full story behind Sessions' recusal?

The attorney general said early on that as someone who had been a campaign partner and advocate for the president, he felt it wasn't appropriate for him to be in charge of any inquiry into how it had been conducted.

""I should not be involved in investigating a campaign I had a role in,"" Sessions said at the Justice Department on the day he announced his decision.

But there are also questions about meetings that Sessions had with Russia's ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak, who has emerged as a key figure in the question of whether any Trump associates had ties to Russian officials. Sessions and Kislyak met at least twice last year.

Sessions has denied that any of his contact with Kislyak involved discussions about the Trump campaign, and he has explained that as a member of the Senate, as he then was, he dealt often with foreign emissaries as part of his normal work.

Comey's hints to the Senate Intelligence Committee, however, suggest that he knew of more contacts or other relationships that made him and the rest of the top FBI leaders expect that Sessions would take himself out of the game.

Whatever they are, they're ""facts that I can't discuss in an open setting,"" Comey said.

What were they?

2. Did Sessions fully recuse himself as promised?

""I have decided to recuse myself from any existing or future investigations of any matters related in any way to the campaigns for President of the United States,"" Sessions said in a statement on March 2. ""I have taken no actions regarding any such matters, to the extent they exist.""

And yet Sessions took a huge action on May 9: He signed a letter, with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, recommending that Trump fire Comey as FBI director. Trump cited the Justice Department leaders' recommendation in his now-famous note to Comey concluding that ""you are not able to effectively lead"" the FBI.

What's more, Trump reportedly tasked Sessions with coming up with the case for firing Comey. How could an attorney general who said he would take himself out of the Russia investigation play a role in firing the officer who was leading it?

And if Sessions was involved with that decision, in what other ways might he have continued to be involved with the Russia inquiry even after announcing that he wouldn't take part?

3. Did Sessions know what Trump planned to ask Comey in the closed meeting?

Comey painted a clear picture for the Senate Intelligence Committee: At the conclusion of a meeting with several people in the Oval Office, Trump — in Comey's telling — cleared the room.

""As the participants started to leave the Oval Office, the attorney general lingered by my chair but the president thanked him and said he wanted to speak only with me,"" Comey wrote in his statement. ""The last person to leave was Jared Kushner [Trump's son-in-law and close adviser], who also stood by my chair and exchanged pleasantries with me. The president then excused him, saying he wanted to speak with me.""

That's when, in Comey's telling, Trump made the ask about the inquiry into the former national security adviser: ""I hope you can let this go.""

Did Sessions know beforehand that the president planned to take aside the FBI director and appeal to him to lay off Flynn? If so, had the president asked him beforehand in some other time or place?

And if not, why did Sessions agree to leave the president alone with someone who was technically his subordinate — the FBI is part of the Justice Department — for a discussion that would have been within his purview?

But if he challenges this story strongly, it helps Trump's narrative that Comey didn't tell the Senate the truth.

On Tuesday, Sessions will have the chance to give his own answer in person — or explain to senators what other conversations he and Trump may have had on this subject about which Comey might not have been aware.

5. What questions will Sessions decline to answer?

Members of Congress would love it if their witnesses gave the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth — but that is seldom how it actually works. On Wednesday last week, the heads of the top intelligence agencies and the deputy attorney general declined to answer key questions for various reasons.

On Thursday, Comey said there were some things he couldn't discuss because they involved classified information. And on Tuesday, odds are good that Sessions may also not respond to some of the most pressing questions at the hearing.

justice,The Hill,1,https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/460527-federal-judge-reinstates-block-on-trumps-asylum-ban-for-migrants-at,Judge reinstates block on Trump's asylum ban for migrants at southern border,2019-09-09,,"A federal judge in California on Monday reinstated a ban on the implementation of a Trump administration policy that would restrict migrants ’ ability to apply for asylum at the southern border .
U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar had issued a nationwide injunction in July blocking the rule , which would make most asylum-seekers who pass through another country before reaching the U.S. ineligible for asylum , with exceptions for victims of trafficking and migrants who have been denied asylum in the countries they traveled through .
The rule would primarily effect Central American migrants crossing through Mexico .
The 9th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Tigar 's initial ruling but narrowed the injunction to only border states within its jurisdiction — California and Arizona — before sending the question back to Tigar .
Tigar said Monday that the injunction should apply nationwide because the asylum rule represents a case where `` such breadth is necessary to remedy a plaintiff 's harm . ''
The Trump administration last month asked the Supreme Court to lift Tigar 's injunction .
`` The injunction now in effect is deeply flawed and should be stayed pending appeal and pending any further proceedings in this Court , '' Solicitor General Noel Francisco said in a filing .

`` Immigration and border security policy can not be run by any single district court judge who decides to issue a nationwide injunction , '' the White House said . `` This ruling is a gift to human smugglers and traffickers and undermines the rule of law .

“ It ’ s very very frustrating but we ’ re going to keep going . We ’ ll continue to work within the current legal framework address this , '' Morgan told reporters at the White House .","A federal judge in California on Monday reinstated a ban on the implementation of a Trump administration policy that would restrict migrants’ ability to apply for asylum at the southern border.

U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar had issued a nationwide injunction in July blocking the rule, which would make most asylum-seekers who pass through another country before reaching the U.S. ineligible for asylum, with exceptions for victims of trafficking and migrants who have been denied asylum in the countries they traveled through.

The rule would primarily effect Central American migrants crossing through Mexico.

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Tigar's initial ruling but narrowed the injunction to only border states within its jurisdiction — California and Arizona — before sending the question back to Tigar.

Tigar said Monday that the injunction should apply nationwide because the asylum rule represents a case where ""such breadth is necessary to remedy a plaintiff's harm.""

The Trump administration last month asked the Supreme Court to lift Tigar's injunction.

""The injunction now in effect is deeply flawed and should be stayed pending appeal and pending any further proceedings in this Court,"" Solicitor General Noel Francisco said in a filing.

The White House blasted the judge's decision in a statement.

""Immigration and border security policy cannot be run by any single district court judge who decides to issue a nationwide injunction,"" the White House said. ""This ruling is a gift to human smugglers and traffickers and undermines the rule of law.

White House counselor Kellyanne Conway told Fox News that Sessions “is willing to cooperate and share what he knows.”

But press secretary Sean Spicer declined to rule out Sessions’s invoking of executive privilege during his testimony, saying, “I think it depends on the scope of the questions.”

Here are five things to watch for.

Did Sessions have a third meeting with a Russian official?

Comey said during a closed-door meeting with the Senate Intelligence Committee that Sessions may have had an undisclosed third meeting with the Russian ambassador.

The former FBI director hedged his comments, but congressional investigators were reportedly already looking into whether Sessions and Sergey Kislyak met on the sidelines of a foreign policy speech Trump gave in April 2016.

The Justice Department has denied that the two talked, saying the “the then-senator did not have any private or side conversations with any Russian officials at the Mayflower Hotel.”

If the third meeting took place, it would contradict Sessions’s previous assertion that he only met twice with the Russian official during the presidential campaign — once at the Republican National Convention and a second time in his Senate office in September 2016.

""I do not recall any discussions with the Russian ambassador, or any other representative of the Russian government, regarding the political campaign on these occasions or any other occasions,” Sessions wrote in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee.

When did he decide to recuse himself from Russia probe?

Sessions will face a barrage of questions over when he decided to recuse himself from the investigation into Russian election meddling, which includes a review of potential ties between the Trump campaign and Moscow to influence the race’s outcome.

Comey told lawmakers that the FBI had expected Sessions to step back from the investigation even before his recusal on March 2. He said the FBI knew of facts that would make it “problematic” for Sessions to oversee the probe.

""It's pretty clear that Comey wanted to signal in his testimony information about Sessions that was pretty concerning,” said a GOP strategist.

It’s unclear what information Comey was referring to.

The Justice Department stressed after the hearing that Sessions began consulting with career department officials shortly after he was confirmed about stepping back from the investigation, and his decision was based only on his status as a Trump campaign supporter.

Ian Prior, a spokesman for the Justice Department, added that Sessions “had not been briefed or participated in any investigation within the scope of the recusal” after he began meeting with ethics officials.

Session’s decision to recuse himself from the probe reportedly strained his relationship with Trump, and senators will likely ask Sessions about reports that he offered to resign.

Will Sessions talk about his involvement in Comey’s firing?

Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told lawmakers during a closed-door meeting that he first learned Trump planned to fire Comey during a May 8 meeting with Sessions and the president.

He and Sessions also discussed replacing Comey during a meeting last year —months before Comey was fired.

“In one of my first meetings with then-Senator Jeff Sessions last winter, we discussed the need for new leadership at the FBI,” Rosenstein told lawmakers, according to his released remarks.

Democrats argue Sessions would have violated his pledge to recuse himself from the Russia probe if he was involved in Comey’s firing. They are expected to ask the attorney general if he knew the president wanted to fire Comey, in part because of the Russia investigation, as Trump has stated publicly.

""If, as the president said, I was fired because of the Russia investigation, why was the attorney general involved in that chain?” Comey said.

Did Comey raise concerns about a meeting with Trump?

Comey told the Intelligence Committee that Trump asked Sessions to leave the room at the end of a Feb. 14 Oval Office meeting, and he thought Sessions lingered “because he knew he shouldn’t be leaving.”

It was after that one-on-one conversation with Trump — when Comey says the president asked him to let go of an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn — that the former FBI director says he asked Sessions not to leave him alone with Trump.

""It can't happen that you get kicked out of the room and the president talks to me,"" Comey says he told Sessions, adding that the attorney general ""didn't say anything.”

The Justice Department also disputes Comey’s version of their conversation, saying the then-FBI director told Sessions that the FBI wanted to make sure it was following the “proper communications protocol” and that Sessions “was not silent.”

""He responded to this comment by saying that the FBI and the Department of Justice needed to be careful about following appropriate policies,” Prior said.

Will GOP senators stand by Sessions?

One area to watch: Do Republicans stand by Sessions — who is widely liked in the caucus — or do they criticize their former colleague?

“I’m awaiting the outcome of the special counsel and their report with what has gone on with Russia, and therefore Sen. Sessions is entitled to the factual findings of this counsel,” Moran said, according to the Kansas City Star.

But Republicans played defense for the Alabama Republican during his contentious confirmation hearing, and again when Democrats called for him to recuse himself or resign over his meetings with Russian officials.

In that context , Sessions volunteered that he was not aware of “ those activities ” — clearly meaning the activities outlined in the dossier .

Perjury is not inaccuracy. It must be willfully false testimony. Willfulness is the criminal law’s most demanding mens rea (state of mind) requirement. Prosecutors must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the speaker knowingly, voluntarily, and intentionally — not by accident, misunderstanding, or confusion — said something that was untrue, with a specific purpose to disobey or disregard the law. Therefore, when there is an allegation of perjury, the alleged false statements must be considered in context. Any ambiguity is construed in favor of innocence. If there is potential misunderstanding, the lack of clarity is deemed the fault of the questioner, not the accused.

Senator Franken patently framed this line of inquiry in the context of Russian espionage against the Trump campaign, drawn from CNN’s report of a salacious, discredited, uncorroborated dossier. It claimed that the Russians had acquired compromising personal and financial information about Donald Trump. With that premise, Franken added the dossier’s claim that “there was a continuing exchange of information between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government.” The point that Franken was clearly driving at was that Sessions, having supported Trump and been a Trump-campaign surrogate, should recuse himself as attorney general from any investigation probing communications between the Trump campaign and Russian officials.

So, was Sessions’s testimony inaccurate? Sure, especially taken out of context. But was it perjurious? Not even close. The context, established by Franken’s questioning, elucidates that when Sessions denied communications with Russians, he was denying that he had spoken with Russian officials as a Trump surrogate, particularly in any relation to the misconduct described in the dossier.",www.nationalreview.com,right,E2R7zZssMAOPAQVs

A federal judge in Hawaii issued a worldwide restraining order against enforcement of key parts of President Donald Trump ’ s revised travel ban executive order just hours before the directive was set to kick in , backed up by a second federal judge in Maryland who put out his own ruling blocking parts of the order .
U.S. District Court Judge Derrick Watson ruled Wednesday that the state of Hawaii and a local Muslim leader had “ a strong likelihood of success on their claim ” that Trump ’ s order intentionally targets Muslims and therefore violates the Constitution ’ s guarantee against establishment of religion .
Watson bluntly rejected the federal government 's claims that the new directive does not target Islam because it is focused on six countries that account for less than 9 percent of the world 's Muslims .
`` The illogic of the Government ’ s contentions is palpable , '' wrote Watson , an appointee of President Barack Obama . `` The notion that one can demonstrate animus toward any group of people only by targeting all of them at once is fundamentally flawed . The Court declines to relegate its Establishment Clause analysis to a purely mathematical exercise . ''
Hours after that opinion emerged , a federal judge in Maryland , U.S. District Court Judge Theodore Chuang — also an Obama appointee and a former Department of Homeland Security deputy counsel — held that Trump 's order appeared to violate a specific provision in federal law by blocking the issuance of immigrant visas from the six targeted countries .
The rulings are another serious blow to Trump ’ s attempt to limit immigration as part of what he claims is an effort to reduce the threat of terrorist attacks in the U.S .
Trump slammed the decision during a speech to a campaign rally in Nashville on Wednesday a short time after the new restraining order was issued .
`` This is , in the opinion of many , an unprecedented judicial overreach . ... This ruling makes us look weak , '' the president declared before appearing to vow to take the issue to the Supreme Court . `` This is a watered-down version of the first one . ... I think we should go back to the first one and go all the way which is what I wanted to do in the first place . ''
“ Trump ’ s statements tonight ? He should just continue talking , because he ’ s making our arguments for us , ” said Marielena Hincapié , executive director of the National Immigration Law Center .
A spokewoman for the Department of Justice called the ruling `` flawed both in reasoning and in scope , '' adding that the administration will `` continue to defend this Executive Order in the courts . ''
Trump effectively abandoned the earlier , broader version of his travel ban order after the bulk of it was blocked by another federal judge and a three-judge appeals court panel declined to allow Trump to restore it .
As the White House mulled the possibility of an appeal of the latest ruling , there was one piece of good news for Trump 's team : Roughly two hours after Watson issued the new restraining order , five 9th Circuit judges formally declared that the original appeals panel made a `` fundamental error '' by refusing to let Trump proceed with his first order .
The dissenters ' move does not alter that earlier ruling but could be seen as a signal to other judges or even the Supreme Court that Trump 's travel orders are legally valid .
`` The President ’ s actions might have been more aggressive than those of his predecessors , but that was his prerogative , '' Judge Jay Bybee and four other Republican-appointed appeals judges wrote in a dissent from the decision not to reconsider the appeals court 's earlier ruling . `` Even if we have questions about the basis for the President ’ s ultimate findings — whether it was a 'Muslim ban ' or something else — we do not get to peek behind the curtain . So long as there is one 'facially legitimate and bona fide ' reason for the President ’ s actions , our inquiry is at an end . ''
However , Chuang soundly rejected that approach in his ruling from Maryland early Thursday , using Trump 's campaign comments and pledges to conclude that the primary purpose of Trump 's travel ban order was to advance religious bias .
`` These statements , which include explicit , direct statements of President Trump 's animus towards Muslims and intention to impose a ban on Muslims entering the United States , present a convincing case that the First Executive Order was issued to accomplish , as nearly as possible , President Trump 's promised Muslim ban , '' Chuang wrote .
Chuang 's decision flatly dismissed the federal government 's arguments that Trump 's comments before he took office should not be considered in assessing the executive order 's purpose .
`` Simply because a decisionmaker made the statements during a campaign does not wipe them from the 'reasonable memory ' of a 'reasonable observer , ' '' the judge wrote , pointing to a federal appeals court decision that considered `` billboards and campaign commercials '' for Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore in concluding that he was motivated by religion when he had a Ten Commandments display installed at a state courthouse .

Chuang said the conclusion that anti-Muslim sentiment was the primarily reason behind the travel ban was supported by the fact that it seemed to be a poor fit for known terrorist threats .
`` In this highly unique case , the record provides strong indications that the national security purpose is not the primary purpose for the travel ban , '' the judge wrote . `` While the travel ban bears no resemblance to any response to a national security risk in recent history , it bears a clear resemblance to the precise action that President Trump described as effectuating his Muslim ban . ''
Watson 's order took a similar tack , citing campaign trail statements by Trump that the judge said amounted to `` significant and unrebutted evidence of religious animus driving the promulgation of the Executive Order and its related predecessor . ''
Watson 's ruling — applicable `` in all places , including the United States '' — blocked two core provisions of Trump 's redrafted order : a 90-day halt in issuance of visas to citizens of six majority-Muslim countries and a 120-day halt of refugee admissions from around the globe . The judge 's 43-page decision was issued about two hours after a court session in Honolulu during which he heard arguments over the legality of the revised order , which Trump signed last week .
Chuang 's decision was narrower in effect , halting only the ban on newly issued visas for citizens of the six countries and not interfereing with the interruption in refugee admissions .
The rulings followed a series of four court hearings on Trump 's revised travel ban held in the hours before it was set to take effect .
In addition to the court sessions in Honolulu and Greenbelt , Maryland , two hearings took place in
Seattle , where U.S. District Court Judge James Robart listened to arguments on a suit filed by individuals in Washington state and their family members abroad . In addition , a group of about half a dozen states asked Robart , the same judge who issued the injunction last month blocking Trump 's first travel ban , to declare that his initial ruling covers the president 's replacement order .
Citing differences in the two orders , the George W. Bush appointee turned down that request , according to reporters in the courtroom . However , Robart left unclear whether he would grant separate motions to block the new order .
At the Maryland hearing , refugee aid organizations pleaded with Chuang not to ignore Trump 's numerous vows to cut off travel to the U.S. by adherents of Islam .
“ It ’ s asking the court to turn a blind eye to all of the evidence that ’ s apparent to everybody , '' said Omar Jadwat of the American Civil Liberties Union . `` It doesn ’ t make sense to blind the court . ”
However , acting Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall warned the judge against taking into account statements Trump made before he took office . The Justice Department lawyer said the revised order does n't even mention religion .
`` This is an order that draws no religious distinctions at all , '' Wall insisted .
The Maryland suit was filed last month by two refugee aid groups , the International Refugee Assistance Project and HIAS , a Jewish charity that facilitates refugee resettlement in the U.S. for the federal government . Several individuals who claim to be directly affected by Trump 's orders are also plaintiffs .
The Maryland suit is the only one that includes a challenge to a specific aspect of Trump 's orders : a provision lowering the cap on annual refugee admissions for the current fiscal year to 50,000 from 110,000 . In addition to the broader argument about the order as a whole being tainted by religious bias , the suit argues that Trump had no authority to lower that cap since federal law says it must be established before the fiscal year begins .
Justice Department attorneys also argued that the case should wait to see whether individual immigrants receive waivers that allow them to get visas despite the six-country ban .
Washington state Attorney General attempts to block Trump 's revised travel ban
However , National Immigration Law Center lawyer Justin Cox said that suggestion was bizarre given the claim that the process itself amounts to illegal religious discrimination .
`` If there were a special process for black folks to live in a certain neighborhood , you would n't say their claims are not ripe until they 're denied '' permission , Cox said .
After the Maryland hearing , refugee advocates used bleak language to describe the scramble underway to protect their clients in case the revised travel 's bans directives kicked in .
`` We 're trying to find emergency shelter and places for people to hide so they do n't get killed while the U.S. is in the process of implementing this executive order , '' said Rebecca Heller of the International Refugee Assistance Project .","Judges use Trump’s own words in ruling against revised travel ban Two federal judges halt the president’s second attempt at his executive order, citing Trump’s prior vows to seek a Muslim ban.

Justice Department attorneys also argued that the case should wait to see whether individual immigrants receive waivers that allow them to get visas despite the six-country ban.

Washington state Attorney General attempts to block Trump's revised travel ban

However, National Immigration Law Center lawyer Justin Cox said that suggestion was bizarre given the claim that the process itself amounts to illegal religious discrimination.

""If there were a special process for black folks to live in a certain neighborhood, you wouldn't say their claims are not ripe until they're denied"" permission, Cox said.

After the Maryland hearing, refugee advocates used bleak language to describe the scramble underway to protect their clients in case the revised travel's bans directives kicked in.

""We're trying to find emergency shelter and places for people to hide so they don't get killed while the U.S. is in the process of implementing this executive order,"" said Rebecca Heller of the International Refugee Assistance Project.

A Manhattan jury has found Harvey Weinstein guilty of rape and sexual abuse but acquitted him of the most serious charges, capping one of the most closely watched trials of the #MeToo era. The mixed verdict means the former Hollywood producer will likely spend time in prison.

It also is some measure of vindication for the six women who testified that Weinstein attacked and sought to intimidate them. Although he was acquitted of the most serious charges — two counts of predatory sexual assault and one count of first-degree rape, which might have put him in a cell for the rest of his life — the jury convicted him of third-degree rape and first-degree criminal sexual act.

The convictions stem from allegations by Miriam Haley, whose account was the basis of the criminal sex act charge, and Jessica Mann, whom the jury found had been raped by Weinstein.

The jury reached its decision after about 30 hours of deliberations over five days.

Weinstein did not visibly react as the verdict was read Monday. But defense lawyer Arthur Aidala said that Weinstein turned to him and that ""all he kept saying is, 'But I'm innocent. ... I didn't rape anyone.' ""

The disgraced movie mogul was led from the court in handcuffs and was ordered to jail. Instead, he was taken to Bellevue Hospital for reasons that weren't immediately clear.

He could face decades in prison. It will be up to New York Judge James Burke to determine just how long the 67-year-old will be behind bars. Sentencing is set for March 11.

In court, defense attorney Donna Rotunno asked Burke to grant bail on the condition that Weinstein continue to wear an ankle monitor, as he has done throughout the trial.

Citing his ""significant medical issues,"" Rotunno said that Weinstein is ""receiving shots in his eyes so he does not go blind"" and that he is still recovering from an unsuccessful back surgery. Burke wasn't swayed, though he did agree to request that Weinstein be housed in an infirmary unit.

Following the verdict, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. thanked the women involved in the case for pulling ""our justice system into the 21st century"" by demanding that Weinstein be held accountable for his actions, no matter how long ago.

Nearly 20,000 other immigrants were held in pretrial detention by the U.S . Marshals Service , most of them in contracted facilities , costing the government $ 134 million for just three months . That works out to nearly $ 90 a day for each person in those contract facilities .

Saunders, Brian Mcnicoll, Daniel Pipes, Jed Babbin","Nearly a century and a quarter ago , several dozen Yiddish-speaking socialists published in New York City on April 22 , 1897 the first issue of Forverts , the name inspired by Vorwarts , the house organ of the German socialist party . Over the decades Forverts became The Forward , a metropolitan daily in Yiddish with a nationwide circulation of more than a quarter of a million . It remained a synthesis of socialist claptrap , depicted preposterously as something having to do with Judaism .
Today The Forward is in English , but it continues to rejoice in , well , now it ’ s “ progressivism. ” Its circulation is only 30,000 , “ a small publication with an outside influence ” according to an appraisal last week by the sympathetic and generally liberal NPR . What we can say is that , in the era of new and influential politically conservative Jewish websites , The Forward remains a relic of left-wing Judaism . You would find more support for Israel in many Christian churches than among the newspaper ’ s editors who , not incidentally , also remain in that perennial socialist time-warp , as if Marx had never been discredited , and as if Bernie Sanders had studied economics and that he is coherent .
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ’ s decision on March 2 “ to recuse himself from dealing with investigations relating to Russia ’ s involvement in the elections , ” observed Nathan Guttman in The Forward the next day , “ make [ Deputy Attorney General Rod ] Rosenstein , once he wins Senate confirmation , the government official who would lead the probe into Trump ’ s Russian connections… ”
Rod J. Rosenstein has integrity . Even this leftist publication The Forward described the 52-year-old Rosenstein as “ the least partisan figure ” Trump has appointed . Noting that Harvard Law School graduate Rosenstein was the longest-serving U.S attorney , the article reported that he had worked in the Bill Clinton Justice Department before serving as the U.S. attorney for Maryland under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama . Hardly a cheerleader for President Donald Trump , the newspaper quoted law professor Carl Tobias praising Rosenstein ’ s “ independence ” and “ professionalism. ” All this was written before the Senate ’ s recent overwhelming confirmation of Rosenstein to be deputy attorney general under the contentious and barely-confirmed Attorney General Jeff Sessions . President Trump in January had picked Rosenstein as acting attorney general after Trump had sacked acting AG ( and Obama holdover ) Sally Yates January 30 for insubordination . Yates a few days ago testified disingenuously . All this brings us to :
2 . Democrats supported Rod J. Rosenstein to be deputy attorney general . On April 3 the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 19-to-1 ( this is not a typo ) to report the Rosenstein nomination to the full Senate . Only Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal voted no , because Rosenstein said he would appoint a special counsel ( for the Russia investigation ) “ whenever I determine it ’ s appropriate based on the polices and procedures of the Department of Justice ” ; that wasn ’ t good enough for Blumenthal who wanted Rosenstein ’ s absolute commitment to appoint a special prosecutor . Rosenstein , Blumenthal conceded , is “ what we value in the Department of Justice : someone committed to the rule of law. ” But Blumenthal was the lone committee vote against Rosenstein because “ I have been surprised and disappointed that he has failed to heed my request. ” Sen. Patrick Leahy , the Vermont Democrat who is no shrinking violet , praised Rosenstein ’ s “ reputation of integrity that ’ s unusual for this administration ’ s nominees. ” And two weeks ago the U.S. Senate confirmed Rosenstein ’ s nomination by the razor-thin margin of 94-to-6 . At that time , the right-wing extremist , Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer noted that Rosenstein “ had developed a reputation for integrity . ”
That was then , this is now . Remember it was just a few months ago that assorted prominent Democrats wanted Comey ’ s scalp . And even this week Comey again made a fool of himself with his “ mildly nauseous ” conditional mea culpa , explaining that if he had to do it all over again , he would still exercise bad judgment and demonstrate incompetence . Now , they are aghast that Trump fired Comey abruptly , when presumably he should have done so earlier . Hence , there must be a sinister motive . When Democrats were on the networks last night charging a cover-up , they were asked for proof and offered none .
CNN ’ s Jeffrey Toobin , who alternates at the network between political kibitzer and legal analyst , said the firing of FBI Director James Comey is an “ extraordinary abuse of power ” and a “ dark day ” for America . MSNBC ’ s Chris Matthews is famous mainly for saying on his network that covering Barack Obama gave him a “ thrill up his leg , ” a phrase open to new interpretation , given the newly-published critically acclaimed biography of Obama that implies that as a young man Obama was sexually ecumenical . Matthews finds the Comey firing to be “ a little whiff of fascism. ” Toobin has termed yesterday the “ Tuesday night massacre ” that will “ disgrace ” Donald Trump . For balance on CNN even Richard Nixon ’ s lawyer John Dean , who threw his client under the bus , said comparisons to Nixon ’ s firing of Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox as part of the “ Saturday night massacre ” were overdrawn . And we ’ re not just talking day of the week .
In contrast , Alan Dershowitz last night on CNN said that Jim Comey lacked the credibility to be the FBI Director and should have resigned because neither Democrats nor Republicans have confidence in him . Dershowitz , himself a liberal Democrat , said that Trump had previously and appropriately replaced Acting AG Sally Yates ; Dershowitz saw no connection between the two firings ( Yates and Comey ) . Indeed , Dershowitz suggested his fellow liberals take a deep breadth and monitor who Trump names as Comey ’ s successor . What a concept — see if Trump appoints a political hack as FBI Director ; or perhaps he will appoint someone greatly respected for probity in the mold of , well… Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein ? As a talking-head expert , Dershowitz is proving to be , for CNN , volatile and unpredictable , even nuanced in his view of Trump and the administration .
( Note to Toobin , Matthews , and the mainstream media : Firing the FBI Director does not end the bureau ’ s ongoing investigation . It continues . )
If you believe Toobin and Matthews and the pervasive hysteria among the liberal media ( a redundancy ) , then you have to assume that Rod Rosenstein , quite implausibly , is part of the conspiracy to obstruct justice , that is , to scuttle the current Department of Justice investigation into the Trump-Russia allegations and to cover-up the cover-up . That is like knowing when to sell your stocks before the crash , and also when to get back in the market precisely before it recovers .
After all , Jeff Sessions recused himself , so Rosenstein is the point man in a sensitive , potentially explosive investigation involving the president of the United States and those around him , so are we to assume that Rosenstein is not the honest man and consummate professional , so acknowledged repetitively and contemporaneously by even Democrat partisans ? Of course , Rosenstein is irrelevant , I suppose , if Trump appoints a crook to head the FBI . But won ’ t that be obvious ?
What ’ s more , President Trump — in his letter to Comey firing him , cited not only AG Sessions but Deputy AG Rosenstein . Indeed , it is Rosenstein ’ s two-page memorandum to Sessions that makes the masterfully succinct case against Comey . Titled “ Restoring Public Confidence in the FBI , ” the memorandum is worth reading .
To summarize , Rosenstein notes that FBI Director Comey on July 5 , 2016 , usurped the Attorney General ’ s authority when he ( Comey ) concluded the case against Hillary Clinton should be closed without prosecution . Quite simply , this was not his decision to make . We all recall the bumbling charade , where Comey explained all the reasons why Hillary should be indicted and prosecuted , and we waited for the punch line . But it seems that Comey had unilaterally concluded and now said she should not be prosecuted — thus also taking off the hook then Attorney General Loretta Lynch , who had recused herself , after her awkward meeting with Bill Clinton , the possible criminal defendant ’ s spouse , on the airport tarmac . Absent Comey ’ s mind boggling acrobatics , the DOJ would have had to make the call on Hillary .
In the Rosenstein memorandum , which is receiving insufficient attention , Rosenstein noted that Comey ’ s news conference with its “ derogatory information ” about Hillary was “ a textbook example of what federal prosecutors and agents are taught not to do. ” There is much more — quite simply , the memorandum will be memorialized in history as the definitive judgment on why Comey should have been replaced by President Trump at the outset .
But he wasn ’ t . And the timing of his firing seems curious . What we do know is that the matter is sloppy . Clearly this has been in the works for a while — days , a week , two weeks ? The Rosenstein memorandum was perhaps proofread and finalized on May 9 , but surely the AG knew it was in the works . No leaks , here !
By all account , Trump , Sessions , Rosenstein , et . al . were playing such inside baseball they did not even know Comey was in Los Angeles . When you ’ re going to fire someone high profile , part of the plan is how to do it . It is unclear at this writing how the ( now former ) FBI director found out .
The Trump stalwarts often say the press is out to get Trump . That may be true , but the administration provides its adversaries in the media with plenty of inspirational material . The administration has presented an image that is less than open and transparent . It has given the impression of something to hide . And the White House counsel has not acted forcefully to prevent even the appearance of conflict of interest and self-dealing .
In short , the firing of Jim Comey is not in a void , but seen in an unflattering context . When the press is routinely attacked every day , the base may love it . But the attacks lose credibility and potency . Americans don ’ t like whiners . All this is why , even with the administration confronting Vladimir Putin and Russia , the suspicion remains that there is unsavory business .
We ’ re talking about the FBI and the Department of Justice . If you want to fire the FBI Director , then replace him with a solid , impeccable choice . And as for the DOJ , let ’ s return to the libertarian impulse for criminal justice reform , and stop this nonsense of renewing a discredited and failed War on Drugs . In short , let ’ s not be reactionary . The hardcore will never cut Trump slack ; but perhaps people in the middle will not see , for example , the Comey firing as part of the conspiracy to obstruct justice .
It ’ s time , then , for President Donald Trump and his administration to bring closure to the Russian stuff by letting a credible investigation run its course , rather quickly . Avoid even the appearance of conflict of interest between any potential Trump extended family ventures and the U.S. government . And stop the daily slow water torture of tweets and circuses , and get back to policy .
That way , when you fire someone who should have been fired in January the spin will not be the search for an ulterior , ominous motive .","Nearly a century and a quarter ago, several dozen Yiddish-speaking socialists published in New York City on April 22, 1897 the first issue of Forverts, the name inspired by Vorwarts, the house organ of the German socialist party.

Consider, two points.

Rod J. Rosenstein has integrity. Even this leftist publication The Forward described the 52-year-old Rosenstein as “the least partisan figure” Trump has appointed.

But Horowitz ’ s reputation will be put to the test when he releases the findings of the Clinton investigation . No matter what he concludes , it ’ s likely to create a political firestorm , coming at a time when both Republicans and the White House are charging that political bias is rampant at the Justice Department and at the FBI .
Horowitz attracted public attention early in his career as an assistant U.S. attorney in New York for prosecuting corrupt police officers in the infamous “ Dirty 30 ” case in the mid-1990s .
He later moved to the Justice Department ’ s criminal division in Washington , where he served as chief of staff for a period spanning the Clinton and Bush administrations .
Bush later appointed Horowitz to a six-year term as a commissioner of the U.S . Sentencing Commission , an agency within the judicial branch that writes sentencing guidelines for federal courts . He was then selected by President Obama to serve as the Justice Department ’ s top watchdog in 2011 .
His job is demanding . Horowitz oversees a department of nearly 500 employees who are responsible for investigating waste , fraud , abuse and misconduct within the Justice Department .
“ You ’ re there to help the agency succeed in doing its job , ” said Hamel , who has known Horowitz since his days working in New York . “ They have to be independent to do that job . They can ’ t be swayed by political issues . ”
He is best remembered in his current role for coming down hard on regional officials at Justice and the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives for the infamous “ Fast and Furious ” operation in which officials allowed the illegal sale of firearms in a botched effort to track Mexican drug cartels .
Just six months into the job , Horowitz issued a report eviscerating law enforcement officials in Arizona for a “ significant lack of oversight ” and disregard for “ the safety of individuals in the United States and Mexico . ”

“ It was just a remarkably intense first six months on the job . I know I wouldn ’ t have chosen to walk into the job that way . Looking back on it , it was sort of trial by fire , ” Horowitz told The Washington Post in 2014 . “ You sink or you swim pretty quickly , and fortunately I didn ’ t sink . People can use their own judgment about how well I swam . ”
Horowitz also clashed with the Obama administration over Justice and the FBI bucking requests for documents from the inspector general ’ s office .
Horowitz ’ s work has earned him respect among his peers . He has been twice elected to lead the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency , the independent panel of inspectors general across the federal government .
“ He is a man of the utmost integrity who is willing to call the shots as he sees them , ” said Stanley Twardy , a Stamford , Conn.-based lawyer who has known Horowitz professionally since his days as a U.S. attorney .
Horowitz formally announced last January that he would investigate allegations of wrongdoing by Justice Department and FBI officials leading up the 2016 election , in response to demands from both Democrats and Republicans .
It ’ s possible that both parties will get political ammunition from Horowitz ’ s report .
The inspector general is examining whether then-FBI Director James Comey James Brien ComeyThere are poor ideas , bad ones and Facebook 's Libra Trump has considered firing official who reported whistleblower complaint to Congress : report Broadcast , cable news networks to preempt regular programming for Trump impeachment coverage MORE broke FBI procedure with his public disclosures about the Clinton case , including the letter that he sent to Congress a few weeks before the election . Before Trump fired Comey , Democrats were outspoken in their criticism of those decisions , saying they violated procedure and cost Clinton the election .
But Horowitz is also looking into allegations that McCabe should have been recused from the investigation . Republicans , including Trump , have seized on reports that McCabe ’ s wife accepted campaign contributions from Clinton ally and former Virginia Gov . Terry McAuliffe when she ran for state office in Virginia , calling it a clear conflict of interest .
Finally , Horowitz is also looking into unauthorized disclosures of information .
Lawmakers have pressed Horowitz to expand the scope of the probe to include Comey ’ s firing or Attorney General Jeff Sessions Jefferson ( Jeff ) Beauregard SessionsMedill dean 'deeply troubled by the vicious bullying and badgering ' of student journalists Trump has considered firing official who reported whistleblower complaint to Congress : report Northwestern student paper apologizes for coverage of 'traumatic ' Jeff Sessions event MORE ’ s recusal from the separate investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election .
Horowitz has not committed to looking into Comey ’ s firing , signaling that doing so could present a conflict with Mueller ’ s investigation .
Horowitz ’ s probe has become all the more relevant in light of McCabe ’ s decision to step down last week . According to The New York Times , Christopher Wray , whom Trump installed as FBI director last year after Comey ’ s ouster , had raised concerns about details of the forthcoming inspector general report that led him to propose that McCabe be demoted .
The Washington Post subsequently reported that Horowitz is examining why McCabe seemingly did not move forward for several weeks on a request to examine new emails in the Clinton investigation that were found on former congressman Anthony Weiner ’ s ( D-N.Y. ) computer .
“ There are a lot of legitimate questions that I hope would be answered by this inspector and that probably aren ’ t going to paint the DOJ or the FBI in a particularly good light , ” said Ron Hosko , a former official in the FBI ’ s criminal investigative division .
The findings could further play into GOP charges of political bias at the FBI , which critics view as part of a broader effort to inhibit Mueller ’ s investigation .
The text exchanges between Strzok and Page came to public light when the Justice Department delivered them to GOP-led panels in Congress in December and also reportedly allowed journalists to view them .
“ These text messages prove what we all suspected : high-ranking FBI officials involved in the Clinton investigation were personally invested in the outcome of the election and clearly let their strong political opinions cloud their professional judgment , ” House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte Robert ( Bob ) William GoodlatteUSCIS chief Cuccinelli blames Paul Ryan for immigration inaction Immigrant advocacy groups should n't be opposing Trump 's raids Top Republican releases full transcript of Bruce Ohr interview MORE ( R-Va. ) told Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein Rod RosensteinDemocrats ask judge to force McGahn to comply with subpoena Democrats ask court to force DOJ 's hand on Mueller grand jury materials Washington celebrates diplomacy — and baseball — at Meridian Ball MORE at a hearing in December .
The Justice Department came under fire from Republicans in January when lawmakers discovered a five-month gap in the text messages ; Horowitz has subsequently said he recovered the missing exchanges and would provide copies to the department , which could decide to release them to Capitol Hill .
Horowitz told lawmakers last November that his investigators had reviewed roughly 1.25 million records and conducted dozens of interviews in connection with the ongoing investigation .
At the time , he said he expected the report to be issued by March or April .
Otherwise , the inspector general has remained tight-lipped on the status of the investigation , including the potential widening of its scope .
His statement last January contained an important caveat . “ If circumstances warrant , ” it said , “ the [ inspector general ] will consider including other issues that may arise during the course of the review . ”","Few people have heard of Michael Horowitz, but that’s about to change.

Just six months into the job, Horowitz issued a report eviscerating law enforcement officials in Arizona for a “significant lack of oversight” and disregard for “the safety of individuals in the United States and Mexico.”

While the investigation absolved Attorney General Eric Holder Eric Himpton HolderObama celebrates 'great night for our country' after Democrats' victories in Virginia and Kentucky After Obama-era abuses, Republican hysteria over impeachment process is absurd Lawmakers come together to honor Cummings: 'One of the greats in our country's history' MORE of blame, Horowitz recommended that the Justice Department consider potential disciplinary action for 14 officials involved.

“It was just a remarkably intense first six months on the job. I know I wouldn’t have chosen to walk into the job that way. Looking back on it, it was sort of trial by fire,” Horowitz told The Washington Post in 2014. “You sink or you swim pretty quickly, and fortunately I didn’t sink. People can use their own judgment about how well I swam.”

Horowitz also clashed with the Obama administration over Justice and the FBI bucking requests for documents from the inspector general’s office.

Horowitz’s work has earned him respect among his peers. He has been twice elected to lead the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, the independent panel of inspectors general across the federal government.

“He is a man of the utmost integrity who is willing to call the shots as he sees them,” said Stanley Twardy, a Stamford, Conn.-based lawyer who has known Horowitz professionally since his days as a U.S. attorney.

Horowitz formally announced last January that he would investigate allegations of wrongdoing by Justice Department and FBI officials leading up the 2016 election, in response to demands from both Democrats and Republicans.

It’s possible that both parties will get political ammunition from Horowitz’s report.

The inspector general is examining whether then-FBI Director James Comey James Brien ComeyThere are poor ideas, bad ones and Facebook's Libra Trump has considered firing official who reported whistleblower complaint to Congress: report Broadcast, cable news networks to preempt regular programming for Trump impeachment coverage MORE broke FBI procedure with his public disclosures about the Clinton case, including the letter that he sent to Congress a few weeks before the election. Before Trump fired Comey, Democrats were outspoken in their criticism of those decisions, saying they violated procedure and cost Clinton the election.

But Horowitz is also looking into allegations that McCabe should have been recused from the investigation. Republicans, including Trump, have seized on reports that McCabe’s wife accepted campaign contributions from Clinton ally and former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe when she ran for state office in Virginia, calling it a clear conflict of interest.

Finally, Horowitz is also looking into unauthorized disclosures of information.

Lawmakers have pressed Horowitz to expand the scope of the probe to include Comey’s firing or Attorney General Jeff Sessions Jefferson (Jeff) Beauregard SessionsMedill dean 'deeply troubled by the vicious bullying and badgering' of student journalists Trump has considered firing official who reported whistleblower complaint to Congress: report Northwestern student paper apologizes for coverage of 'traumatic' Jeff Sessions event MORE’s recusal from the separate investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Horowitz has not committed to looking into Comey’s firing, signaling that doing so could present a conflict with Mueller’s investigation.

Horowitz’s probe has become all the more relevant in light of McCabe’s decision to step down last week. According to The New York Times, Christopher Wray, whom Trump installed as FBI director last year after Comey’s ouster, had raised concerns about details of the forthcoming inspector general report that led him to propose that McCabe be demoted.

The Washington Post subsequently reported that Horowitz is examining why McCabe seemingly did not move forward for several weeks on a request to examine new emails in the Clinton investigation that were found on former congressman Anthony Weiner’s (D-N.Y.) computer.

“There are a lot of legitimate questions that I hope would be answered by this inspector and that probably aren’t going to paint the DOJ or the FBI in a particularly good light,” said Ron Hosko, a former official in the FBI’s criminal investigative division.

The findings could further play into GOP charges of political bias at the FBI, which critics view as part of a broader effort to inhibit Mueller’s investigation.

The text exchanges between Strzok and Page came to public light when the Justice Department delivered them to GOP-led panels in Congress in December and also reportedly allowed journalists to view them.

“These text messages prove what we all suspected: high-ranking FBI officials involved in the Clinton investigation were personally invested in the outcome of the election and clearly let their strong political opinions cloud their professional judgment,” House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte Robert (Bob) William GoodlatteUSCIS chief Cuccinelli blames Paul Ryan for immigration inaction Immigrant advocacy groups shouldn't be opposing Trump's raids Top Republican releases full transcript of Bruce Ohr interview MORE (R-Va.) told Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein Rod RosensteinDemocrats ask judge to force McGahn to comply with subpoena Democrats ask court to force DOJ's hand on Mueller grand jury materials Washington celebrates diplomacy — and baseball — at Meridian Ball MORE at a hearing in December.

The Justice Department came under fire from Republicans in January when lawmakers discovered a five-month gap in the text messages; Horowitz has subsequently said he recovered the missing exchanges and would provide copies to the department, which could decide to release them to Capitol Hill.

Horowitz told lawmakers last November that his investigators had reviewed roughly 1.25 million records and conducted dozens of interviews in connection with the ongoing investigation.

At the time, he said he expected the report to be issued by March or April.

Otherwise, the inspector general has remained tight-lipped on the status of the investigation, including the potential widening of its scope.

His statement last January contained an important caveat. “If circumstances warrant,” it said, “the [inspector general] will consider including other issues that may arise during the course of the review.”",www.thehill.com,center,hNXuJuw2hFlHrqlC

Old case, new developments

During her 2016 presidential campaign, then-candidate Clinton admitted she kept and exchanged emails on a private account and server during her time as secretary of State. This led the FBI to conduct an investigation that included an interview with Clinton. It found dozens of messages contained highly classified information, but ultimately recommended against criminal charges.

In July 2016, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled that messages and documents in private accounts that are considered government records can be subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. Numerous publications then filed FOIA requests for records relating to the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attack.

One of the most active filers has been conservative group Judicial Watch, which, dating back to 2015, has filed FOIA lawsuits involving the private server. According to NBC, the group has been a strong advocate for complete transparency from the former secretary, claiming no search can be complete without a thorough search of every email.

Initially, the State Department found 69 pages ""responsive"" to the group's FOIA request. However, Judicial Watch has continually filed requests in hopes of accessing the entire server. Most recently, the group has filed FOIA requests for more emails from Clinton and her longtime aide, Cheryl Mills, both of whom have released thousands of emails so far.

After a long delay, on March 2, U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth issued an order that Clinton and Mills would be required to sit for sworn depositions to Judicial Watch about records relating to the 2012 Benghazi attack.

However, immediately after Lamberth's order, both Clinton's and Mills' lawyers petitioned the D.C. Circuit to vacate the order through a writ of mandamus.

What happened on June 2?

On June 2, attorneys for Clinton and Mills attended a telehearing with the D.C. Circuit. Judges heard arguments regarding a petition to reverse Lamberth's March 2 ruling that Clinton and Mills be required to give in-person depositions to Judicial Watch.

No ruling was made on the petition.

Judicial Watch attorney Ramona Cotca argued that by proceeding with the depositions, Clinton and Mills might help clarify where the State Department can broaden its search. Cotca also accused Clinton and Mills of trying to ""short-circuit this process by using (Mandamus) the most potent weapon in the judicial arsenal.""

However, Clinton's attorney, David Kendall, argued that both Clinton and Mills have turned over tens of thousands of messages and have no more related emails to surrender. He also argues that Judicial Watch is not seeking information about legal or factual issues relating to the FOIA suit but instead ammunition to embarrass Clinton and her allies.

Our ruling: False

We rate the claim that Hillary Clinton was in court on June 2 testifying about emails relating to child sex trafficking as FALSE because it is not supported by our research. While Clinton's attorney attended a virtual hearing regarding a petition in a case requesting emails on a private server, Clinton did not testify during the hearing, nor was the case about child sex trafficking.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Wednesday took up an unlikely cause — the plight of convicted fraudster Paul Manafort.

The progressive lawmaker expressed alarm at reports that President Donald Trump’s former campaign chairman would likely be held in isolation after his expected transfer to Rikers Island — the New York City jail complex is in her congressional district — to face additional state fraud charges.

“A prison sentence is not a license for gov torture and human rights violations. That’s what solitary confinement is,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. “Manafort should be released, along with all people being held in solitary.”

The freshman lawmaker doubled down on her comments when told that Manafort may technically be placed in protective custody. She tweeted that protective custody is a separate method, but “does not necessarily exclude solitary. If he is in fact not being held in solitary, great. Release everyone else from it, too.”

Oscasio-Cortez has been critical of retributive justice used by the prison system. When news broke that Chelsea Manning was being held in solitary confinement for refusing to answer questions before a grand jury, Oscasio-Cortez tweeted that the United States should “ban extended solitary confinement” and that the practice is a form of torture.

Paul Manafort is being sent to solitary confinement in my district - Rikers Island.

However, Manafort’s possible isolation at Rikers may be partly because of his and his lawyers’ concerns about his safety.

Manafort’s lawyers complained about his confinement from the start after a federal judge ordered him to jail in June 2018 over allegations that he was trying to tamper with the testimony of two potential witnesses in the federal case against him brought by then-special counsel Robert Mueller, and Trump personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani later lamented that the longtime GOP operative was being nearly “tortured” in his conditions.

But legal experts say that Manafort got special arrangements away from the general prison population because of his high-profile status. At his first jail in Warsaw, Va., Manafort told friends he was being treated like a “VIP” and federal prosecutors explained in court briefs that the GOP operative had a private cell with a bathroom and shower, a personal telephone and access to work space to meet with his lawyers. Manafort’s situation changed in July 2018 when he was moved to Alexandria, Va., in a transfer that his own attorneys had requested to help them be closer to their client as they prepared for his first trial.

Manafort was relocated in April to a minimum-security prison in Waymart, Pa., where he’s serving a 7 ½-year sentence for a series of lobbying, money laundering, financial fraud and witness tampering crimes.

Manafort was also indicted this past March by the Manhattan district attorney as part of an effort to make sure the former Trump ally would still face prison time even if the president pardoned him. The DA wrote in a report following the indictment that Manafort was arrested for a “yearlong residential mortgage fraud scheme” through which Manafort and others “illegally obtained millions of dollars.” His final list of indictments included 16 counts of fraud and one of conspiracy.

Todd Blanche, Manafort’s New York-based lawyer handling the state case, said in an interview he’d make a request to the state judge presiding over the new charges to have his client returned to the Pennsylvania federal facility after his arraignment, rather than have Manafort kept at a city jail.

Blanche said he did not know when that arraignment would take place — he expected about 24-hours notice. He also said he remained in the dark as to whether Manafort would even be brought to Rikers but said he expected state jail supervisors would need to take into account Manafort’s high-profile status when considering whether to put him in a protected area or added to the general population.

“Safety is a big concern,” he told POLITICO.

Manafort’s defense attorneys who worked on his federal case did not respond to a request for comment.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on Tuesday said at a news conference that Manafort will not be given special treatment at Rikers beyond measures needed for security.

Edward Snowden%27s disclosures have made government surveillance a front-burner issue

The close House vote shows many feel lawmakers feel the government has gone too far

Opponents of the NSA programs vow to continue the fight

What a difference a leak makes.

The close House vote Wednesday on a measure to block the National Security Agency's wholesale collection of telephone records is a vivid symbol of the impact of Edward Snowden.

Suddenly, the ""Security State"" is in the spotlight rather than hidden in the shadows. Suddenly the question of government surveillance of millions of Americans suspected of absolutely nothing is a front-burner issue, a focus of national debate.

As it should be.

One of the many troubling aspects of the federal government's massive data mining program is the fact that it was imposed in secret. The Obama administration likes to say that all three branches of government were in on the deal. And that's technically true, but not very reassuring.

HOUSE :Rejects plan to kill NSA data collection

SNOWDEN UPDATE:Russia's protection is latest affront to U.S.

The top people in Congress on intelligence matters show little skepticism about such initiatives. And the shadowy Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court almost never met a government request it couldn't embrace.

The agglomeration of massive troves of records about the telephone and digital activities of Americans represents a significant shift in the way we approach civil liberties in this country. It's a decision that needs to be made in plain view, with the input of the American people. At last we are having that debate.

Yes, the Obama administration managed to beat back the measure, which would have limited NSA telephone surveillance to specific targets. In other words, Big Brother could only round up the ""telephony metadata"" -- who you called, how long the call was, etc. -- when it could show there was a good reason to do so.

But the surprisingly close tally -- 217 against, 205 for -- shows how profoundly the Snowden disclosures have resonated. The fact that there was a vote at all was significant.

The amendment attracted support from an unlikely amalgamation of legislators on the left and the right, from those concerned about the erosion of civil liberties and the unchecked power of big government.

The political outlooks of the amendment's sponsors, both from Michigan, illustrates the diversity of the anti-snooping coalition. Rep. Justin Amash is a libertarian Republican, a Ron Paul guy. Rep. John Conyers is a veteran liberal Democratic warhorse.

While the measure was vigorously opposed -- both by the Obama administration and the House Republican leadership, it attracted 94 votes from the GOP and 111 from Democrats.

Alluding to the amendment's appeal to those at the far ends of the political spectrum, Rep. Raul Labrador. an Idaho Republican, joked that it had the support of the ""wing-nut coalition.""

It's clear that the narrow defeat of the amendment hardly means the debate is over. ""This is only the beginning,"" Conyers vowed after the vote. In the Senate, Democrats Ron Wyden of Oregon and Mark Udall of Colorado have made clear their vehement opposition to the NSA programs.

In the immediate aftermath of the Snowden disclosures, there was a sense that Americans were not overly outraged by the surveillance and that little change would ensue. But public sentiment may well be shifting.

A Washington Post/ABC News poll this week found that nearly three-fourths of Americans think the NSA data collection programs infringe on some Americans' rights, and about half feel their own rights have been affected.

But more needs to be done for a responsible investigation into Russia , the election , and the Trump campaign , they add .
An investigation needs a greater degree of independence – perhaps through a special prosecutor , used during Watergate and again in the Clinton “ Whitewater ” scandal , or a bipartisan commission , such as the 9/11 Commission .
Reports suggest that Mr . Sessions twice met with the Russian ambassador to the United States last year – information he did not disclose during his Senate confirmation hearings in January . On Thursday , Sessions announced that it would be “ right and just ” to recuse himself in matters “ that deal with the Trump campaign . ”
A recusal from the nation 's top law enforcement official is rare in these kinds of investigations . But allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 campaign have beset President Trump for months .
Michael Flynn , the president 's former national security adviser , resigned last month after reports that he had discussed Russian sanctions with the same ambassador , Sergey Kislyak , before Trump took office .
In a press conference Thursday , Sessions said that he had been considering whether to recuse himself before The Washington Post reported news of his meetings with Mr. Kislyak .
He also said he was taken aback during his confirmation hearings by a question from Sen. Al Franken ( D ) of Minnesota about contacts with Russian officials . At the time , Sessions said he did not have any such contacts . At Thursday 's press conference , however , he acknowledged he should have “ slowed down and said I did meet one Russian official a couple times . ”
Multiple investigations are ongoing . An interagency group including the Federal Bureau of Investigation , the Central Intelligence Agency , the National Security Agency , and Treasury Department has been investigating communications between Trump campaign officials and Russia for months , perhaps since as early as April 2016 , according to reports . Separately , three Senate committees are delving into different allegations of Russian interference in the election .
But there is a sense that neither Sessions ’ recusal nor the current investigations are sufficient . Sessions ’ decision “ is incredibly important , but I don ’ t think it ’ s enough , ” says Jonathan Smith , a lawyer in the Justice Department ’ s Civil Rights Division during the Obama administration .
“ It ’ s critically important that there ’ s an independent review , not just of Sessions but of the entire questions around [ Trump campaign ] contact with Russians during the campaign , ” he adds .
Some lawmakers from both parties are calling for a special prosecutor .
Such an approach has proved effective in the past . But the attorney general has traditionally had significant authority over the appointment and handling of special prosecutors .
On one hand , “ special counsels ” are the way for the Justice Department to handle “ matters which may raise a conflict of interest ” for the department , according to a 2013 Congressional Research Service ( CRS ) report . Yet the special counsels are “ appointed by … answerable to , and may have their prosecutorial or investigative decisions countermanded by ” the attorney general , it added . Some investigative actions , like wire intercepts and subpoenas , would require prior approval from the attorney general , according to another CRS report .
In the case of a recusal of the attorney general , the acting attorney general would be in charge of appointing a special counsel . But the second- and third-highest ranking officials in the Justice Department have not yet been confirmed by the Senate .
Others are calling for a broader approach . One idea is an independent , bipartisan commission in the style of the 9/11 Commission . Another is the creation of a temporary investigative select committee within Congress .
“ The essential problem is that there is no current congressional mechanism with the investigative scope , staffing , and will to answer these questions in a serious fashion , ” write Susan Hennessey and Benjamin Wittes on the Lawfare blog .
They argue for a select committee , suggesting that a 9/11-style commission would be too grandiose and ill-fitted for the current partisan environment .
“ Given the palpably toxic atmosphere , a serious and credible investigation into Trump and his associates will … be met with substantial resistance by the White House and administration appointees , ” they write .
While a select committee would be vulnerable to the political whims of congressional leaders , it would provide the necessary flexibility and authority to carry out a fair investigation , they suggest .
And unlike a special prosecutor , it would be above the appearance of influence by the Justice Department .
“ Sessions himself may be implicated in the exact subject matter of what this investigation would entail , ” says Kami Chavis , a former assistant US attorney and now director of the Criminal Justice Program at Wake Forest University School of Law .
“ In the interest of transparency , and in order for us to have trust and confidence in that investigation , [ the investigation ] should happen outside of the Justice Department . ”","Attorney General Jeff Sessions' decision to recuse himself from investigations of Russian contacts with Trump campaign officials is a step in the right direction, some legal experts say.

But more needs to be done for a responsible investigation into Russia, the election, and the Trump campaign, they add.

An investigation needs a greater degree of independence – perhaps through a special prosecutor, used during Watergate and again in the Clinton “Whitewater” scandal, or a bipartisan commission, such as the 9/11 Commission.

Reports suggest that Mr. Sessions twice met with the Russian ambassador to the United States last year – information he did not disclose during his Senate confirmation hearings in January. On Thursday, Sessions announced that it would be “right and just” to recuse himself in matters “that deal with the Trump campaign.”

He added: “I have now decided to recuse myself of any existing or future investigations of any matter relating in any way to campaigns for president of the United States.” Some legal analysts pointed out that his wording about the campaign made it unclear if Sessions would recuse himself from investigations involving Trump's activities as president. [Editor's note: This sentence was added to explain the contention by some that the attorney general's recusal was partial.]

A recusal from the nation's top law enforcement official is rare in these kinds of investigations. But allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 campaign have beset President Trump for months.

Michael Flynn, the president's former national security adviser, resigned last month after reports that he had discussed Russian sanctions with the same ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, before Trump took office.

At Thursday's press conference, however, he acknowledged he should have “slowed down and said I did meet one Russian official a couple times.”

Multiple investigations

Multiple investigations are ongoing. An interagency group including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, and Treasury Department has been investigating communications between Trump campaign officials and Russia for months, perhaps since as early as April 2016, according to reports. Separately, three Senate committees are delving into different allegations of Russian interference in the election.

But there is a sense that neither Sessions’ recusal nor the current investigations are sufficient. Sessions’ decision “is incredibly important, but I don’t think it’s enough,” says Jonathan Smith, a lawyer in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division during the Obama administration.

“It’s critically important that there’s an independent review, not just of Sessions but of the entire questions around [Trump campaign] contact with Russians during the campaign,” he adds.

Special prosecutor

Some lawmakers from both parties are calling for a special prosecutor.

Such an approach has proved effective in the past. But the attorney general has traditionally had significant authority over the appointment and handling of special prosecutors.

On one hand, “special counsels” are the way for the Justice Department to handle “matters which may raise a conflict of interest” for the department, according to a 2013 Congressional Research Service (CRS) report. Yet the special counsels are “appointed by … answerable to, and may have their prosecutorial or investigative decisions countermanded by” the attorney general, it added. Some investigative actions, like wire intercepts and subpoenas, would require prior approval from the attorney general, according to another CRS report.

In the case of a recusal of the attorney general, the acting attorney general would be in charge of appointing a special counsel. But the second- and third-highest ranking officials in the Justice Department have not yet been confirmed by the Senate.

Commission or select committee?

Others are calling for a broader approach. One idea is an independent, bipartisan commission in the style of the 9/11 Commission. Another is the creation of a temporary investigative select committee within Congress.

“The essential problem is that there is no current congressional mechanism with the investigative scope, staffing, and will to answer these questions in a serious fashion,” write Susan Hennessey and Benjamin Wittes on the Lawfare blog.

They argue for a select committee, suggesting that a 9/11-style commission would be too grandiose and ill-fitted for the current partisan environment.

“Given the palpably toxic atmosphere, a serious and credible investigation into Trump and his associates will … be met with substantial resistance by the White House and administration appointees,” they write.

While a select committee would be vulnerable to the political whims of congressional leaders, it would provide the necessary flexibility and authority to carry out a fair investigation, they suggest.

And unlike a special prosecutor, it would be above the appearance of influence by the Justice Department.

“Sessions himself may be implicated in the exact subject matter of what this investigation would entail,” says Kami Chavis, a former assistant US attorney and now director of the Criminal Justice Program at Wake Forest University School of Law.

“In the interest of transparency, and in order for us to have trust and confidence in that investigation, [the investigation] should happen outside of the Justice Department.”",www.csmonitor.com,center,EXmYxG1hvosnby9S

justice,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/2018/11/13/18087560/matt-whitaker-mueller-trump-sessions,"The many scandals of Trump’s new acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker, explained",2018-11-13,"Andrew Prokop, Hannah Brown, Lauren Katz, Theodore Schleifer, Li Zhou, Sean Collins, Umair Irfan","Just one week into his new job as acting attorney general , Matt Whitaker is under siege .
He ’ s deeply distrusted at the Justice Department . There are widespread fears that he might try to squelch investigations into President Trump . There are questions about his background — and even about whether his appointment is illegal .
Before joining the Justice Department in the fall of 2017 , Whitaker was a harsh public critic of special counsel Robert Mueller . Not only did he publicly opine that the Trump campaign hadn ’ t colluded with Russia and that there was no obstruction of justice case against the president , but he mused about how a replacement for Jeff Sessions could rein Mueller in .
Now Whitaker is that replacement , until a permanent successor for Sessions is confirmed . And shortly after Whitaker got the gig , word leaked out from his allies that he had no intention of recusing himself regarding Mueller — positioning him to learn what the special counsel has found , and to potentially curb the probe or even end it entirely .
Whitaker ’ s appointment was deeply unusual . Trump departed from the Justice Department ’ s usual line of succession to put him in the post , using an obscure law called the Vacancies Reform Act that lets the president temporarily fill vacant positions . Critics soon put forward several different arguments that the appointment was illegal . And the matter has already made it to the federal courts — the attorney general of Maryland filed papers Tuesday trying to get Whitaker ’ s appointment struck down , and arguing that “ [ Deputy Attorney General ] Rod Rosenstein is the acting attorney general . ”
Whitaker ’ s appointment has been criticized on other grounds too — for instance , he recently served on the advisory board of a scam company that the government shut down . The backlash was severe enough that by Friday , Trump was falsely claiming that he “ didn ’ t know Matt Whitaker. ” But so far , he ’ s still in the job .
Whitaker , who is now 49 years old , grew up in Iowa and attended the University of Iowa for college and then law school . After a relatively undistinguished legal career , he ’ d made enough friends in high places to become one of three people Sen. Chuck Grassley ( R-IA ) recommended to George W. Bush for a US attorney post in 2004 . He got the job . ( A Des Moines Register article announcing his appointment focused mainly on the fact that he played college football . )
In his five-year stint as US attorney for the Southern District of Iowa , Whitaker proved willing to court political controversy . In 2007 , he was criticized for participating in an event for the Iowa Christian Alliance , a conservative-leaning political group . That same year , he indicted state Sen. Matt McCoy for alleged crimes involving his business . McCoy was eventually acquitted , and he ’ s argued that his prosecution was political — that the ambitious Whitaker wanted to “ give the evangelical right ” a “ trophy ” by prosecuting him , a prominent gay Democratic politician .
After exiting the US attorney ’ s post in 2009 , Whitaker returned to law and bounced around various unsuccessful GOP political campaigns in Iowa . He also ran for US Senate in 2014 , when he argued that judges should have “ a biblical view of justice ” and not “ a secular world view ” ( he finished fourth in the GOP primary ) .
But Whitaker became better-known among national conservatives once he landed a plum gig at a conservative nonprofit group , the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust ( FACT ) . At first , the group , funded by anonymous conservative donors , was all about getting Whitaker into the press so that he , a former US attorney , could accuse Hillary Clinton of committing crimes . ( “ I would indict Hillary Clinton , ” he wrote in a 2016 USA Today op-ed . )
When Trump won , Whitaker pivoted — his new job seemed to be arguing that Trump and his associates didn ’ t commit crimes , particularly in relation to Mueller ’ s investigation . This hackishness landed Whitaker a CNN contributor gig , since the network wanted some reliable Trump defenders .
Whitaker reportedly said privately that his goal with these on-air remarks was to impress the cable TV-obsessed president and get nominated as a judge . It partly worked — the New York Times reports that Trump did enjoy Whitaker ’ s TV appearances . But the president had other plans for him .
Whitaker was a White House ally at the Justice Department
In March 2017 , Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that he would recuse himself from the FBI ’ s investigation into Trump associates ’ ties to Russia and potential interference with the campaign . Sessions did so on the advice of department ethics lawyers ( he ’ d been involved with the campaign ) . But Trump responded with fury , claiming that he expected his attorney general to protect him from investigations like these .
Their relationship never recovered . Trump berated Sessions privately and , starting in July 2017 , mocked and insulted him publicly in an apparent effort to goad him into resigning . But Sessions stayed in the job , and at that point , Trump was unwilling to take the political risk of actually firing him ( key Republican senators were urging him not to ) .
So the White House appears to have hatched a different plan . In August 2017 , the job of Sessions ’ s chief of staff was open . Whitaker was already on Trump ’ s radar — per the New York Times , he ’ d been interviewed about joining the White House “ as a legal attack dog ” against Mueller . But the White House instead urged Sessions to hire Whitaker as his chief of staff , and the AG agreed .
Whitaker seems to have been put in place to keep an eye on Sessions and the Justice Department . He often spoke on the phone with Trump and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly . He went over to meet Trump more than a dozen times ( usually with Sessions ) . He gained a reputation in the DOJ as “ a partisan and a White House spy , ” the New York Times reported . And when Trump would rant about the Mueller probe , Whitaker often “ smiled knowingly and nodded in assent , ” the Washington Post reported .
Rumors that Trump was on the verge of firing either Sessions or Rosenstein have been omnipresent this year . And in retrospect , it ’ s now clear that the White House has for some time had Whitaker in mind as a replacement for whoever went first . ( When it briefly appeared that Rosenstein was on the way out in September , word leaked out that the White House had planned to name Whitaker to succeed him . )
Trump didn ’ t end up taking any action before the midterms — but the very next day after they were over , he had Kelly call Sessions . The message was that Trump wanted Sessions out , and would name Whitaker to replace him .
What happened next was dramatic , according to CNN ’ s Evan Perez , Laura Jarrett , and Ariane de Vogue . Top Justice Department officials huddled in Sessions ’ s office and urged him to try to delay the effective date of his resignation by a few days , while Whitaker held his own “ huddle ” of loyalists in a different office just “ a few yards away. ” But eventually , Whitaker asked to speak to Sessions alone — and after they spoke , Sessions told his own group that he ’ d leave that day .
Thus , Whitaker completed his 13-month ascent from TV pundit to the top law enforcement official in the United States . But immediately , controversy swirled around his appointment — over whether he ’ d politically interfere with investigations , over shady aspects of his business history , and over the appointment ’ s very legality .
The entire reason Trump so badly wanted Sessions gone was because he had recused himself from oversight of the Russia investigation . Now Trump has replaced him with someone who has not only criticized the probe but has even publicly mused about how it could be squelched .
Indeed , between May and September 2017 — before he got the job as Sessions ’ s chief of staff — Whitaker said or tweeted :
It sure looks like Trump may have put in Whitaker as a hatchet man , to end the probe or at least to better “ protect ” Trump from it .
Whitaker now has the power to do many things . He could refuse to sign off on certain new investigative moves ( like a subpoena of the president ) or further expansion of the probe . He could try to ensure that , should Mueller write a report on Russian interference , it wouldn ’ t be given to Congress . He could demand a detailed briefing on the state of the investigation and then leak information he learns to Trump . He could even try to fire Mueller outright .
Then there ’ s the potential for Whitaker to launch politicized investigations into Trump ’ s enemies . Murray Waas reported for ███ that he has already been involved in such discussions this year — that as Sessions ’ s chief of staff , he tried to pressure the Justice Department to comply with Trump ’ s demands to launch investigations into Hillary Clinton and others .
Whether Whitaker will actually do any of this remains to be seen . His every move will be under a microscope , scrutinized by officials under him and , soon , a House Democratic majority . He could even expose himself to potential legal risk for obstruction of justice , should he interfere .
Last week , two people close to Whitaker told the Washington Post that Whitaker had no intention of recusing himself from oversight of Mueller ’ s probe . But in a statement Monday night , a Justice Department spokesperson said Whitaker is “ fully committed to following all appropriate processes and procedures ” at DOJ , including “ consulting with senior ethics officials ” on “ matters that may warrant recusal . ”
Entirely separate from all matters relating to Mueller , Clinton , and other political issues , questions arose about a rather shady-looking part of Whitaker ’ s recent business history : his service on the advisory board of a company called World Patent Marketing .
The Miami-based company claimed it would help inventors get patents and then would help promote their inventions . But customers said World Patent Marketing was just a scam . The company “ simply took cash without ever meeting or reviewing any pitches , ” and as it raked in more than $ 26 million , “ virtually none of the firm ’ s clients ever made money , ” the Miami New Times reported .
The firm ’ s CEO had donated to Whitaker ’ s Senate campaign in 2014 , and that year , Whitaker agreed to serve on World Patent Marketing ’ s advisory board . “ As a former US Attorney , I would only align myself with a first class organization , ” he was quoted saying in a 2014 press release .
World Patent Marketing was also infamous for threatening customers who went public about their disgruntlement — and Whitaker participated . He emailed a customer that he was a former US attorney and that “ smearing ” World Patent Marketing online could lead to “ serious civil and criminal consequences , ” per the New Times .
The Federal Trade Commission eventually forced the company to shut down in 2017 , and an FBI criminal investigation into the firm is ongoing , according to the Wall Street Journal . In October 2017 , the FTC even subpoenaed Whitaker for records related to this company . But , per the Washington Post ’ s sources , Whitaker then “ failed to provide any information , telling investigators that he was busy at that time moving from Iowa to Washington for a new job . ”
It ’ s not clear how deeply Whitaker was involved in the company or how much he knew about the business practices — but needless to say , none of this reflects very highly on the new acting attorney general ’ s ethics or judgment .
Then , separately from that , the AP ’ s Ryan Foley and David Pitt reported on how a company of Whitaker ’ s “ walked away from a taxpayer-subsidized apartment-rehabilitation project in Iowa after years of cost overruns , delays and other problems. ” ( A DOJ spokesperson blamed the debacle on “ a bad general contractor . ” )
Finally , beyond any of Whitaker ’ s personal traits , there ’ s yet another set of controversies around the legality of his appointment .
Trump appears to have named Whitaker acting AG by using a law called the Vacancies Reform Act . Passed in 1998 , the VRA gives the president some leeway to go outside the ordinary line of succession to temporarily fill Cabinet jobs that become vacant , putting in acting appointees of his choice who either have been confirmed by the Senate for another post or have worked in a top job in the relevant department .
This law had been somewhat obscure until President Trump started using it for high-profile , controversial appointments of loyalists — for instance , he put in Mick Mulvaney as the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , Robert Wilkie as acting veterans affairs secretary , and now Whitaker as acting attorney general .
But several legal questions have been raised about Whitaker ’ s appointment , and we can think about them in two buckets :
Statutory questions : Some have asked whether the VRA conflicts with a separate law about DOJ ’ s succession . Others have pointed out that the VRA is about replacing officials who resigned , and questioned whether Sessions ’ s Trump-ordered exit counts as a firing instead ( though Sessions did use the word “ resignation ” ) .
Some have asked whether the VRA conflicts with a separate law about DOJ ’ s succession . Others have pointed out that the VRA is about replacing officials who resigned , and questioned whether Sessions ’ s Trump-ordered exit counts as a firing instead ( though Sessions did use the word “ resignation ” ) . Constitutional questions : In an op-ed last week , lawyers Neal Katyal and George Conway argued that there that there is a constitutional problem with using the VRA to appoint Whitaker — because he wasn ’ t confirmed by the Senate for this stint in government . The Appointments Clause of the Constitution , they say , requires a “ principal officer ” of the executive branch to be confirmed by the Senate . Former Bush Justice Department official John Yoo agreed , saying “ the statute is unconstitutional when applied in this way . ”
Other legal experts have argued that Trump ’ s appointment of Whitaker is probably legal after all . “ For better or worse , Congress in 1998 authorized the president to name agency officials not confirmed by the Senate ” as acting appointees , University of Texas law professor Stephen Vladeck writes . He added that “ there ’ s no textual basis in the Constitution ” for the courts to require acting top appointees be Senate-confirmed .
The stakes here are enormously high — if the courts deem Whitaker ’ s appointment illegal , any action or decision he ’ s involved in as acting AG could come under legal scrutiny . On Wednesday , the Justice Department ’ s Office of Legal Counsel issued an opinion that Whitaker ’ s appointment was legal and constitutional . But the matter had already made it into court by then , with Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh arguing in an Obamacare-related lawsuit that Whitaker ’ s appointment is illegal .
Despite all this , Whitaker currently remains in place . And unless Trump decides to oust him , he ’ ll likely remain at the top of the Justice Department until a new attorney general is both nominated and confirmed by the Senate — a process that could take months .
So the long-awaited showdown between President Trump and his Justice Department could finally be coming .
We don ’ t have a very good idea of what ’ s been going on behind the scenes with Mueller ’ s investigation lately . Some rumors claim new indictments are imminent , while others claim Mueller is close to finishing up . But we don ’ t truly know what evidence he ’ s amassed , who ’ s in the crosshairs , or what the special counsel ’ s hoped-for next move might be .
So depending on where Mueller is in the probe and what he ’ s found , and how Whitaker responds , we could see a true crisis over whether investigations into the president and his associates will still be permitted — or whether Trump will manage to bend the Justice Department to his political will .","Just one week into his new job as acting attorney general, Matt Whitaker is under siege.

He’s deeply distrusted at the Justice Department. There are widespread fears that he might try to squelch investigations into President Trump. There are questions about his background — and even about whether his appointment is illegal.

Before joining the Justice Department in the fall of 2017, Whitaker was a harsh public critic of special counsel Robert Mueller. Not only did he publicly opine that the Trump campaign hadn’t colluded with Russia and that there was no obstruction of justice case against the president, but he mused about how a replacement for Jeff Sessions could rein Mueller in.

Now Whitaker is that replacement, until a permanent successor for Sessions is confirmed. And shortly after Whitaker got the gig, word leaked out from his allies that he had no intention of recusing himself regarding Mueller — positioning him to learn what the special counsel has found, and to potentially curb the probe or even end it entirely.

Whitaker’s appointment was deeply unusual. Trump departed from the Justice Department’s usual line of succession to put him in the post, using an obscure law called the Vacancies Reform Act that lets the president temporarily fill vacant positions. Critics soon put forward several different arguments that the appointment was illegal. And the matter has already made it to the federal courts — the attorney general of Maryland filed papers Tuesday trying to get Whitaker’s appointment struck down, and arguing that “[Deputy Attorney General] Rod Rosenstein is the acting attorney general.”

Whitaker’s appointment has been criticized on other grounds too — for instance, he recently served on the advisory board of a scam company that the government shut down. The backlash was severe enough that by Friday, Trump was falsely claiming that he “didn’t know Matt Whitaker.” But so far, he’s still in the job.

Who is Matt Whitaker?

Whitaker, who is now 49 years old, grew up in Iowa and attended the University of Iowa for college and then law school. After a relatively undistinguished legal career, he’d made enough friends in high places to become one of three people Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) recommended to George W. Bush for a US attorney post in 2004. He got the job. (A Des Moines Register article announcing his appointment focused mainly on the fact that he played college football.)

In his five-year stint as US attorney for the Southern District of Iowa, Whitaker proved willing to court political controversy. In 2007, he was criticized for participating in an event for the Iowa Christian Alliance, a conservative-leaning political group. That same year, he indicted state Sen. Matt McCoy for alleged crimes involving his business. McCoy was eventually acquitted, and he’s argued that his prosecution was political — that the ambitious Whitaker wanted to “give the evangelical right” a “trophy” by prosecuting him, a prominent gay Democratic politician.

After exiting the US attorney’s post in 2009, Whitaker returned to law and bounced around various unsuccessful GOP political campaigns in Iowa. He also ran for US Senate in 2014, when he argued that judges should have “a biblical view of justice” and not “a secular world view” (he finished fourth in the GOP primary).

But Whitaker became better-known among national conservatives once he landed a plum gig at a conservative nonprofit group, the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust (FACT). At first, the group, funded by anonymous conservative donors, was all about getting Whitaker into the press so that he, a former US attorney, could accuse Hillary Clinton of committing crimes. (“I would indict Hillary Clinton,” he wrote in a 2016 USA Today op-ed.)

When Trump won, Whitaker pivoted — his new job seemed to be arguing that Trump and his associates didn’t commit crimes, particularly in relation to Mueller’s investigation. This hackishness landed Whitaker a CNN contributor gig, since the network wanted some reliable Trump defenders.

Whitaker reportedly said privately that his goal with these on-air remarks was to impress the cable TV-obsessed president and get nominated as a judge. It partly worked — the New York Times reports that Trump did enjoy Whitaker’s TV appearances. But the president had other plans for him.

Whitaker was a White House ally at the Justice Department

In March 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that he would recuse himself from the FBI’s investigation into Trump associates’ ties to Russia and potential interference with the campaign. Sessions did so on the advice of department ethics lawyers (he’d been involved with the campaign). But Trump responded with fury, claiming that he expected his attorney general to protect him from investigations like these.

Their relationship never recovered. Trump berated Sessions privately and, starting in July 2017, mocked and insulted him publicly in an apparent effort to goad him into resigning. But Sessions stayed in the job, and at that point, Trump was unwilling to take the political risk of actually firing him (key Republican senators were urging him not to).

So the White House appears to have hatched a different plan. In August 2017, the job of Sessions’s chief of staff was open. Whitaker was already on Trump’s radar — per the New York Times, he’d been interviewed about joining the White House “as a legal attack dog” against Mueller. But the White House instead urged Sessions to hire Whitaker as his chief of staff, and the AG agreed.

Whitaker seems to have been put in place to keep an eye on Sessions and the Justice Department. He often spoke on the phone with Trump and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly. He went over to meet Trump more than a dozen times (usually with Sessions). He gained a reputation in the DOJ as “a partisan and a White House spy,” the New York Times reported. And when Trump would rant about the Mueller probe, Whitaker often “smiled knowingly and nodded in assent,” the Washington Post reported.

How Whitaker got Sessions’s job

Rumors that Trump was on the verge of firing either Sessions or Rosenstein have been omnipresent this year. And in retrospect, it’s now clear that the White House has for some time had Whitaker in mind as a replacement for whoever went first. (When it briefly appeared that Rosenstein was on the way out in September, word leaked out that the White House had planned to name Whitaker to succeed him.)

Trump didn’t end up taking any action before the midterms — but the very next day after they were over, he had Kelly call Sessions. The message was that Trump wanted Sessions out, and would name Whitaker to replace him.

What happened next was dramatic, according to CNN’s Evan Perez, Laura Jarrett, and Ariane de Vogue. Top Justice Department officials huddled in Sessions’s office and urged him to try to delay the effective date of his resignation by a few days, while Whitaker held his own “huddle” of loyalists in a different office just “a few yards away.” But eventually, Whitaker asked to speak to Sessions alone — and after they spoke, Sessions told his own group that he’d leave that day.

Thus, Whitaker completed his 13-month ascent from TV pundit to the top law enforcement official in the United States. But immediately, controversy swirled around his appointment — over whether he’d politically interfere with investigations, over shady aspects of his business history, and over the appointment’s very legality.

The controversies over Whitaker politically interfering with investigations

The entire reason Trump so badly wanted Sessions gone was because he had recused himself from oversight of the Russia investigation. Now Trump has replaced him with someone who has not only criticized the probe but has even publicly mused about how it could be squelched.

Indeed, between May and September 2017 — before he got the job as Sessions’s chief of staff — Whitaker said or tweeted:

It sure looks like Trump may have put in Whitaker as a hatchet man, to end the probe or at least to better “protect” Trump from it.

Whitaker now has the power to do many things. He could refuse to sign off on certain new investigative moves (like a subpoena of the president) or further expansion of the probe. He could try to ensure that, should Mueller write a report on Russian interference, it wouldn’t be given to Congress. He could demand a detailed briefing on the state of the investigation and then leak information he learns to Trump. He could even try to fire Mueller outright.

Then there’s the potential for Whitaker to launch politicized investigations into Trump’s enemies. Murray Waas reported for Vox that he has already been involved in such discussions this year — that as Sessions’s chief of staff, he tried to pressure the Justice Department to comply with Trump’s demands to launch investigations into Hillary Clinton and others.

Whether Whitaker will actually do any of this remains to be seen. His every move will be under a microscope, scrutinized by officials under him and, soon, a House Democratic majority. He could even expose himself to potential legal risk for obstruction of justice, should he interfere.

Last week, two people close to Whitaker told the Washington Post that Whitaker had no intention of recusing himself from oversight of Mueller’s probe. But in a statement Monday night, a Justice Department spokesperson said Whitaker is “fully committed to following all appropriate processes and procedures” at DOJ, including “consulting with senior ethics officials” on “matters that may warrant recusal.”

The controversy over Whitaker’s business history

Entirely separate from all matters relating to Mueller, Clinton, and other political issues, questions arose about a rather shady-looking part of Whitaker’s recent business history: his service on the advisory board of a company called World Patent Marketing.

The Miami-based company claimed it would help inventors get patents and then would help promote their inventions. But customers said World Patent Marketing was just a scam. The company “simply took cash without ever meeting or reviewing any pitches,” and as it raked in more than $26 million, “virtually none of the firm’s clients ever made money,” the Miami New Times reported.

The rock star prosecutor and scourge of Wall Street corruption, gangs, terrorists and cyber criminals -- and the most high profile US Attorney in the nation -- said he was fired by President Donald Trump on Saturday.

He was never going to go quietly.

True to his brash style, the man dubbed ""the Sheriff of Wall Street"" declined to offer his resignation as US attorney for the Southern District of New York — the most celebrated prosecutorial shop in the country — following a request by the Trump administration.

In keeping with an innovative personality that shook up the sometimes stuffy world of the law, the crusading prosecutor, 48, announced his exit on Twitter.

""I did not resign. Moments ago I was fired,"" he wrote after a standoff with the administration, which is purging politically appointed Obama administration attorneys.

After being nominated by President Barack Obama in 2009, Bharara quickly carved out a reputation for sniffing out huge, intricate financial frauds, often at hedge funds or giant Wall Street firms.

His office racked up nearly $500 million in settlements, including against Deutsche Bank and CitiMortgage for faulty lending practices. He targeted cyber hacking groups LulzSec and Anonymous, according to his profile on the Southern District's website.

Bharara's team of hard-driving prosecutors also went after international narcotics traffickers, corruption in local and state government, including in Albany, and took down gang kingpins and mobsters in the Bronx, Yonkers and other areas. His office extradited and sent to jail arms trafficker Viktor Bout and put Faisal Shahzad, the Times Square bomber, behind bars for life.

Given New York's international profile, many of Bharara's cases went global.

India demanded an apology for Khobragade's treatment. Faced with the unraveling of a crucial US relationship with a key Asian power, Secretary of State John Kerry expressed ""regret"" for the incident.

Fran, Abigail Tracy, Tina Nguyen","At first blush , the news about U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions looked bad . At second blush , it looked worse . At third blush , I got tired of blushing and ran outside to cool my face with fresh snow . But then things started to settle . With most Russia-related stories these days , especially ones in The New York Times and The Washington Post , the best initial reaction is heavy skepticism . That way you aren ’ t surprised when embarrassing editorial disclaimers appear above stories that Russia hacked a Vermont utility or spread “ fake news ” via dozens of U.S. websites from Drudge to Truthdig , and you read past the headline of stories like “ Trump Aides Had Contact With Russian Intelligence . ”
On the other hand , lies are lies , and lies under oath are even bigger lies , regardless of what they ’ re about—Russia or height or size of fish . So the question is simple : did Sessions perjure himself , and was some sort of cover-up going on ?
To back up for a second , here is an overview of the controversy . On Wednesday night , The Washington Post reported the following : “ Then-Sen. Jeff Sessions ( R-Ala. ) spoke twice last year with Russia ’ s ambassador to the United States , Justice Department officials said , encounters he did not disclose when asked about possible contacts between members of President Trump ’ s campaign and representatives of Moscow during Sessions ’ s confirmation hearing to become attorney general . ”
So what gives ? Former president George W. Bush chief White House ethics lawyer Richard W. Painter has taken to The New York Times opinion pages to call it a “ bombshell of a story ” and suggest that , in the past , anyone testifying so inaccurately “ would have been fired and had his or her security clearances revoked immediately , and probably also would have been criminally prosecuted. ” By contrast , Senator Ted Cruz has called it a “ nothing burger. ” He ’ s a man with rhetorical gifts .
Originally , when writing this story , I intended to offer three hypotheses for what could have happened : ( 1 ) Sessions was colluding with Moscow and trying to hide it . ( 2 ) Sessions wasn ’ t colluding with Moscow , but he forgot about his meetings with Kislyak . ( 3 ) Sessions wasn ’ t colluding with Moscow , but decided to lie about contacts with Russians .
I dismissed Hypothesis 1 . If you ’ re conspiring with Moscow , then you at least try to be sneaky about things . Maybe meeting your co-plotter in your Senate office is so obvious that it ’ s a brilliant fake , but—really . I was more partial to Hypothesis 2 , especially since Senator Claire McCaskill just tweeted out today that during her years in the Senate she had had “ No call or meeting w/Russian ambassador . Ever. ” —only to be revealed to have had such interactions after all . But Sessions also submitted a Questions for the Record filing , or QFR , and such documents are completed with great deliberation and care . There ’ s no excuse for an omission or falsehood in that format . So that left Hypothesis 3 : that Sessions was trying to avoid feeding perceptions of Russian coziness and therefore denied something that had happened .
Then I reviewed the tape . And now I dismiss all three .
Who asked what , and how did they ask it ? I looked up the QFR that Sessions submitted . Here was the Russia question as posed by Vermont Democrat Patrick Leahy : “ Several of the President-Elect ’ s nominees or senior advisers have Russian ties . Have you been in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election , either before or after election day ? ” Here was Sessions ’ answer : “ No . ”","At first blush, the news about U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions looked bad. At second blush, it looked worse. At third blush, I got tired of blushing and ran outside to cool my face with fresh snow. But then things started to settle. With most Russia-related stories these days, especially ones in The New York Times and The Washington Post, the best initial reaction is heavy skepticism. That way you aren’t surprised when embarrassing editorial disclaimers appear above stories that Russia hacked a Vermont utility or spread “fake news” via dozens of U.S. websites from Drudge to Truthdig, and you read past the headline of stories like “Trump Aides Had Contact With Russian Intelligence.”

On the other hand, lies are lies, and lies under oath are even bigger lies, regardless of what they’re about—Russia or height or size of fish. So the question is simple: did Sessions perjure himself, and was some sort of cover-up going on?

To back up for a second, here is an overview of the controversy. On Wednesday night, The Washington Post reported the following: “Then-Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) spoke twice last year with Russia’s ambassador to the United States, Justice Department officials said, encounters he did not disclose when asked about possible contacts between members of President Trump’s campaign and representatives of Moscow during Sessions’s confirmation hearing to become attorney general.”

So what gives? Former president George W. Bush chief White House ethics lawyer Richard W. Painter has taken to The New York Times opinion pages to call it a “bombshell of a story” and suggest that, in the past, anyone testifying so inaccurately “would have been fired and had his or her security clearances revoked immediately, and probably also would have been criminally prosecuted.” By contrast, Senator Ted Cruz has called it a “nothing burger.” He’s a man with rhetorical gifts.

Originally, when writing this story, I intended to offer three hypotheses for what could have happened: (1) Sessions was colluding with Moscow and trying to hide it. (2) Sessions wasn’t colluding with Moscow, but he forgot about his meetings with Kislyak. (3) Sessions wasn’t colluding with Moscow, but decided to lie about contacts with Russians.

I dismissed Hypothesis 1. If you’re conspiring with Moscow, then you at least try to be sneaky about things.

Everyone reading this sentence likely ( hopefully ! ) agrees that women deserve the same rights as men . But just a couple of centuries ago , that idea would ’ ve been dismissed as absurd .
The same is true for the belief that black people should have the same rights as white people . Commonly accepted now ; unthinkable a couple of centuries ago .
There ’ s a concept from philosophy that describes this evolution — it ’ s called humanity ’ s expanding moral circle . The circle is the imaginary boundary we draw around those we consider worthy of moral consideration . Over the centuries , it ’ s expanded to include many people who were previously left out of it . As they were brought into the circle , those people won rights . Slavery was abolished . Women got the vote . Same-sex marriage was legalized .
The moral circle is a fundamental concept among philosophers , psychologists , activists , and others who think seriously about what motivates people to do good . It was introduced by historian William Lecky in the 1860s and popularized by philosopher Peter Singer in the 1980s .
Now it ’ s cropping up more often in activist circles as new social movements use it to make the case for granting rights to more and more entities . Animals . Nature . Robots . Should they all get rights similar to the ones you enjoy ? For example , you have the right not to be unjustly imprisoned ( liberty ) and the right not to be experimented on ( bodily integrity ) . Maybe animals should too .
If you ’ re tempted to dismiss that notion as absurd , ask yourself : How do you decide whether an entity deserves rights ?
Many people think that sentience , the ability to feel sensations like pain and pleasure , is the deciding factor . If that ’ s the case , what degree of sentience is required to make the cut ? Maybe you think we should secure legal rights for chimpanzees and elephants — as the Nonhuman Rights Project is aiming to do — but not for , say , shrimp .
Some people think sentience is the wrong litmus test ; they argue we should include anything that ’ s alive or that supports living things . Maybe you think we should secure rights for natural ecosystems , as the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund is doing . Lake Erie won legal personhood status in February , and recent years have seen rights granted to rivers and forests in New Zealand , India , and Colombia .
And then there are some who argue that even machines can be granted rights . What about a robot we may invent in the future that seems just as sentient as chimpanzees and elephants , despite being made of silicon ? Maybe you think it would be wrong to discriminate on the basis of substrate , so we need the legal system to recognize robot rights , a theme Northern Illinois University media studies professor David Gunkel explores in his new book of that name .
The idea of expanding humanity ’ s moral circle raises knotty questions . What happens when different beings have competing needs ? How do we decide whose rights take precedence ?
These are questions that activists for the rights of animals , nature , and robots all grapple with as they use the idea of the moral circle to mount their arguments . They say there ’ s no reason to assume that once we ’ ve included all human beings , the circle has expanded as far as it should . They invite us to envision a possible future in which we ’ ve stretched our moral universe still further .
Many factors enabled the moral circle to expand in the past
“ The circle of altruism has broadened from the family and tribe to the nation and race , and we are beginning to recognize that our obligations extend to all human beings . The process should not stop there , ” Singer wrote in his 1981 book The Expanding Circle , adding that to stop at human beings would be arbitrary . “ The only justifiable stopping place for the expansion of altruism is the point at which all whose welfare can be affected by our actions are included within the circle of altruism . ”
Singer went on to argue that reason , by its nature , doesn ’ t tolerate inconsistency and arbitrariness — so if we follow the path of rational thinking , it ’ ll lead us to push past inherited biases , whether they ’ re against other people or other species . He believes rational thought has played a major role in expanding the moral circle over the centuries .
“ Reason enables us to take the point of view of the universe , ” he told me .
Although rationality might help nudge us toward a more universal perspective , it alone can ’ t get us all the way there . There are other psychological , sociological , and economic forces at work .
Psychologists have shown that we tend to feel more capable of extending moral concern to others if we ’ re not competing with them for scarce resources and if our own needs are already taken care of . Abraham Maslow famously illustrated this basic concept with his image of a pyramid representing our hierarchy of needs .
It ’ s pretty hard to worry about the lofty goals at the top of the pyramid if we ’ re busy worrying about our own bodily safety , which is at the base .
Mapping this insight onto the moral circle , a team of Australian psychologists noted in a 2016 study : “ One possibility is that moral expansiveness is evident in cases for which people ’ s basic needs have been met , allowing them to turn their attention and resources to more distant entities . ”
Scholars have tried to show through particular historical examples how the development of new technologies can create the conditions for more people to gain rights . In some cases , that ’ s because the inventions take care of some of our more basic needs . Emanuela Cardia at the University of Montreal studied more than 3,000 censuses from the 1940s and found that household inventions — the washing machine , the refrigerator , the electric stove — were a major engine of liberation for women . Once the washing machine was invented and made widely accessible , for instance , women were freed up to do other things , like join the workforce .
Other technological innovations contributed to women ’ s liberation , not by nixing the need for them to labor so long at home but just by making it easier for them to leave home . The invention of the bicycle increased women ’ s mobility and independence so dramatically that Susan B. Anthony once said , “ I think it has done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world . ”
Similarly , other inventions have arguably catalyzed the expansion of the moral circle . Steven Pinker , in his book The Better Angels of Our Nature , says the printing press was crucial to humanity ’ s ethical development because it helped spread humanitarian ideas .
This isn ’ t to say we should adopt a technologically deterministic view . Tech innovation isn ’ t necessarily the primary factor allowing the moral circle to expand ( and in fact , it can often cause a lot of harm ) . But it ’ s one of several factors that can make a larger moral circle more likely .
Another factor , of course , is the presence of activists who are willing to work damn hard to push the boundaries of the circle . Yes , the bicycle was important . So was Susan B. Anthony .
Strategies for proactively expanding the moral circle — for example , to include animals
Some activist movements have been more successful than others . So in trying to figure out how advocates can boost their chances of successfully expanding the circle , it makes sense to investigate what contributed to the success or failure of past movements .
One group taking that historical approach is the Sentience Institute , which bills itself as “ an advocacy think tank researching and advising advocates on the most effective strategies to expand humanity ’ s moral circle. ” In 2017 , the institute chose the British anti-slavery movement as a case study and used it to identify successful tactics and best practices that can be applied to a very different context : today ’ s movement against animal farming .
Jacy Reese , the co-founder of the Sentience Institute and author of The End of Animal Farming , told me the study yielded a number of interesting insights . For one , he said , “ Anti-slavery advocates were having the exact same debates that we ’ re having in the animal rights movement . ”
One debate common to both movements is whether incremental reforms do more harm than good . Even as abolitionists campaigned for small reforms that they hoped would make life a bit easier for slaves , some worried that approach would lead people to think the problem had been solved and would cause complacency about ending slavery altogether . But that ’ s not what happened . “ We ’ re finding evidence that there was more momentum than complacency , ” Reese said .
To him , that suggests animal rights advocates should push ahead with cage-free campaigns and other incremental reforms , because they ’ re unlikely to cause too much complacency , at least if certain conditions are met .
Meanwhile , psychologists are conducting empirical research to understand what motivates people to expand the moral circle . They ’ ve found that a lot depends on how the issue is phrased .
In a 2009 study , the Australian psychologist Simon Laham found that if you ask people which entities they ’ d include in their circle , they produce a smaller circle than if you ask them which entities they ’ d exclude . “ Clearly , ” Laham writes , “ if one wants to foster expansiveness of moral regard , one should focus not on why an entity should be afforded moral treatment , but why an entity should not be . ”
In 2011 , an international team of psychologists found that if you ask people to compare animals with humans , that yields a larger circle than if you ask them to compare humans with animals . Again , even though the exercise is basically the same , the way you package it matters .
Here ’ s another important lesson , gleaned from multiple psychology studies : We humans are much more likely to extend concern to entities we perceive to be like us . When we view animals as having cognitive and emotional capacities similar to humans ’ , we tend to include them in our moral circle , while animals that aren ’ t so easily anthropomorphized get left out . One 2015 study even found that “ simply being asked to consider whether dogs have human-like traits can temporarily increase support for animal rights more broadly . ”
For advocates , this could suggest that anthropomorphizing animals is a highly worthwhile strategy — when you can pull it off . It might not work so well with , say , chickens , so it doesn ’ t make sense to rely exclusively on this strategy if you want to reduce high-impact animal suffering . But it ’ s one useful tool in the arsenal , and you can already see it at work in the legal campaigns seeking personhood status for animals .
In 2016 , psychologists asked participants to place various human and nonhuman entities within defined boundaries that indicate how much moral concern they deserve . They called this the moral expansiveness scale . Here ’ s how they described their findings :
People have a tendency to put their family and friends at the center of their moral circle , with other human groups afforded lower levels of priority . In-group members are more central than out-group members , followed by highly sentient animals , the environment , animals with low sentience , and plants . ( Villains , interestingly , often lie outside people ’ s moral circles altogether . )
The experiment shows , in stark visual terms , that many people think sentience is a crucial factor in deciding how much moral concern an entity deserves . Humans are favored over chimps , chimps are favored over chickens , chickens are favored over plants . ( Reflecting on why villains get kicked to last place despite being human , the researchers theorize that it might be because they ’ re perceived to have a high level of agency or moral responsibility , and yet they ’ ve violated it , so they deserve punishment . )
Plants are an interesting marginal case . In recent years , some have argued that plants have some degree of sentience . They seek out certain outcomes ( like sunlight ) and avoid others , they send out biochemical distress signals to other plants , and they “ seem to lose consciousness ” when sedated in scientific experiments .
But the idea that plants are sentient is hotly contested — a status reflected by their outlying position in the moral expansiveness scale . Both Reese and Singer told me they don ’ t see plants as sentient , although they said they ’ d change their views if convincing new evidence were to emerge .
“ Is there something that it ’ s ‘ like ’ to be a tree when that tree is being chopped down or not getting water and therefore dying ? My guess is no , ” Singer said .
For his part , Reese said , “ We need more scientific knowledge before we can resolve the questions about how much we should care about plants . ”
One marginal case not tested for in the moral expansiveness scale is artificial intelligence . For Singer , the question of whether future robots will belong in our circle is straightforward . “ The rights of robots is still just a case of how you apply the boundary of sentience . If AI is sentient , then it ’ s definitely included , in my view . If not , then it ’ s not , ” he told me .
How we ’ re going to discover whether a robot is sentient is still open for debate , but to Singer it ’ s obvious that whenever the answer turns out to be yes , inclusion in the moral circle must follow .
A critical perspective on the idea of the moral circle
It ’ s worth noting that any choice of litmus test for inclusion in the circle is , to some degree , culturally determined . Instead of working to empirically determine which entities are and aren ’ t sentient , you might sidestep that whole question and believe instead that anything that ’ s alive or that supports life is worthy of moral consideration .
That ’ s what Albert Schweitzer did when , inspired by the Indian religion of Jainism , he formulated his ethic of “ reverence for life. ” Here ’ s how he explained it :
A man is really ethical only when he obeys the constraint laid on him to help all life which he is able to succor , and when he goes out of his way to avoid injuring anything living . He does not ask how far this or that life deserves sympathy as valuable in itself , nor how far it is capable of feeling . To him life itself is sacred .
Jainism , which was founded in the sixth century BC , has long emphasized the supreme value of ahimsa , or nonviolence to all living creatures . Many monks take this so seriously that they cover their mouths with fabric to avoid accidentally breathing in insects , and sweep the ground ahead as they walk to avoid stepping on them .
In Latin America , the Quechua people of the Andes draw on the concept , rooted in indigenous spirituality , of sumak kawsay ( also known by the Spanish name buen vivir ) , an understanding of the good life that entails living in harmony with the natural environment . In this paradigm , nature is not property with instrumental value — it ’ s inherently valuable and has its own inalienable rights . Nature ’ s rights to exist and flourish are even enshrined in Ecuador ’ s constitution .
Examples like these complicate the Western narrative of moral progress . The circle may have expanded to include more beings in more places over the centuries , but the expansion is by no means linear . For some , like the Jains and Quechua people , the inclusion of all animals and of nature in the circle has long been morally obvious . So when talking about expanding the moral circle , it ’ s worth taking care to avoid Eurocentrism , the concept of progress that views Western historical innovations as the only ones that count .
When I raised this critique with Singer , he said , “ You ’ re right that when I talk about it as a linear process , I ’ m talking about broadly Western development . But I don ’ t think the fact that there are other cultures that take different views is in itself a reason to assume they are right and we are missing something . We need to ask why they reached their conclusions and whether there is something to be learned from them . ”
That ’ s a fair point , and it brings up one last important observation . Although it may be tempting to think that the larger your moral circle is , the more it maps onto contemporary progressive ideals , that ’ s not necessarily right .
For example , when examining cases at the margins of life , one thing people ask is whether fetuses should be brought into our circle more centrally . Philosophers like Judith Jarvis Thomson as well as psychologists like Simon Laham have examined how our judgments about whether fetuses belong in the circle may inflect our positions on abortion . The moral calculus around that debate is notoriously fraught , not least because those who think fetuses deserve more moral concern still have to weigh that concern against a right that will be in competition with it : a woman ’ s right over her own body .
How wide will humanity ’ s moral circle be in 100 years ? It ’ s entirely possible that we ’ ll have expanded it in some respects and narrowed it in others . I can imagine us having laws against eating sentient animals , even as we continue to repress certain classes of people . When we look at human history , we see not linear progress but a messy squiggle . Its contours are defined by who ’ s in power , as is the very definition of what counts as progress .
In The Expanding Circle , Singer notes that “ today ’ s enlightened thinking often turns out to be tomorrow ’ s hidebound conservatism , ” adding : “ Perhaps my incomprehension proves only that I , like earlier humans , am unable to break through the limited vision of my own time . ”
Because we are all products of our time , that intellectual humility is the healthiest posture we can adopt . Not having simple answers may make us uncomfortable , but I tend to think it ’ s a productive discomfort .","Share All sharing options for: Should animals, plants, and robots have the same rights as you?

Many monks take this so seriously that they cover their mouths with fabric to avoid accidentally breathing in insects, and sweep the ground ahead as they walk to avoid stepping on them.

In Latin America, the Quechua people of the Andes draw on the concept, rooted in indigenous spirituality, of sumak kawsay (also known by the Spanish name buen vivir), an understanding of the good life that entails living in harmony with the natural environment. In this paradigm, nature is not property with instrumental value — it’s inherently valuable and has its own inalienable rights. Nature’s rights to exist and flourish are even enshrined in Ecuador’s constitution.

Examples like these complicate the Western narrative of moral progress. The circle may have expanded to include more beings in more places over the centuries, but the expansion is by no means linear. For some, like the Jains and Quechua people, the inclusion of all animals and of nature in the circle has long been morally obvious. So when talking about expanding the moral circle, it’s worth taking care to avoid Eurocentrism, the concept of progress that views Western historical innovations as the only ones that count.

When I raised this critique with Singer, he said, “You’re right that when I talk about it as a linear process, I’m talking about broadly Western development. But I don’t think the fact that there are other cultures that take different views is in itself a reason to assume they are right and we are missing something. We need to ask why they reached their conclusions and whether there is something to be learned from them.”

That’s a fair point, and it brings up one last important observation. Although it may be tempting to think that the larger your moral circle is, the more it maps onto contemporary progressive ideals, that’s not necessarily right.

For example, when examining cases at the margins of life, one thing people ask is whether fetuses should be brought into our circle more centrally. Philosophers like Judith Jarvis Thomson as well as psychologists like Simon Laham have examined how our judgments about whether fetuses belong in the circle may inflect our positions on abortion. The moral calculus around that debate is notoriously fraught, not least because those who think fetuses deserve more moral concern still have to weigh that concern against a right that will be in competition with it: a woman’s right over her own body.

How wide will humanity’s moral circle be in 100 years? It’s entirely possible that we’ll have expanded it in some respects and narrowed it in others. I can imagine us having laws against eating sentient animals, even as we continue to repress certain classes of people. When we look at human history, we see not linear progress but a messy squiggle. Its contours are defined by who’s in power, as is the very definition of what counts as progress.

In The Expanding Circle, Singer notes that “today’s enlightened thinking often turns out to be tomorrow’s hidebound conservatism,” adding: “Perhaps my incomprehension proves only that I, like earlier humans, am unable to break through the limited vision of my own time.”

Because we are all products of our time, that intellectual humility is the healthiest posture we can adopt. Not having simple answers may make us uncomfortable, but I tend to think it’s a productive discomfort.

Growing controversy continues to surround the meeting between U.S. Attorney General Loretta and former President Bill Clinton.

The private meeting took place Monday at Phoenix's Sky Harbor International Airport on Lynch's private plane after the two realized they were on the same tarmac.

It also took place just hours before the release of the Benghazi report. That's raising questions about whether the Justice Department, which is conducting an investigation of Hillary Clinton's private email server, might have been compromised.

Lynch acknowledged the meeting with the former president but said there was no discussion of the investigation involving his wife, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, or the congressional report that examined her response to the deadly 2012 Benghazi attacks.

""I did see President Clinton at the Phoenix airport as I was leaving, and he spoke to myself and my husband on the plane,'' Lynch told reporters. ""Our conversation was a great deal about his grandchildren. It was primarily social and about our travels.''

Presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump has been critical of the meeting.

""I am just, I'm flabbergasted by it. I think it's amazing. I've never seen anything like that before,"" the billionaire businessman told Fox News host Sean Hannity Thursday night.

Some Democrats are also weighing in on the issue.

David Axelrod, former chief strategist to President Barack Obama tweeted, ""I take @LorettaLynch & @billclinton at their word that their convo in Phoenix didnt' touch on probe. But foolish to create such optics.""

That was more than all previous presidents combined , although two of them were investigations inherited from the Bush-era task force . And Mr. Trump has encouraged taking an even harder line .
In February , Mr. Trump told Mr. Comey , then the F.B.I . director , that the bureau should consider prosecuting reporters for publishing classified information , according to a contemporaneous memo Mr. Comey wrote about the conversation . The government has never charged a reporter for publishing restricted information , and Mr . Sessions on Friday did not respond to a question about whether such a step was under consideration .
Speaking to reporters in a subsequent briefing , Mr. Sessions ’ s deputy , Rod J. Rosenstein , demurred when asked whether the administration would prosecute reporters in relation to leaks , saying he would not “ comment on hypotheticals. ” He also said the review of the leak investigation guidelines had just begun and it was not clear what , if anything , would be changed about them .

That was more than all previous presidents combined, although two of them were investigations inherited from the Bush-era task force. And Mr. Trump has encouraged taking an even harder line.

In February, Mr. Trump told Mr. Comey, then the F.B.I. director, that the bureau should consider prosecuting reporters for publishing classified information, according to a contemporaneous memo Mr. Comey wrote about the conversation. The government has never charged a reporter for publishing restricted information, and Mr. Sessions on Friday did not respond to a question about whether such a step was under consideration.

Speaking to reporters in a subsequent briefing, Mr. Sessions’s deputy, Rod J. Rosenstein, demurred when asked whether the administration would prosecute reporters in relation to leaks, saying he would not “comment on hypotheticals.” He also said the review of the leak investigation guidelines had just begun and it was not clear what, if anything, would be changed about them.

The White House announced late last week that Trump intends to nominate individuals for the three California vacancies on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, moving Republicans closer to their long-held goal of rebalancing the appeals court, which they argue is too liberal and too large.

The 9th Circuit, based in San Francisco, has frustrated Trump by acting as a foil to some of his most controversial policies, including ruling against the travel ban and an effort to cut off federal funding for so-called sanctuary cities.

The nominations could escalate tensions on the Judiciary Committee, where emotions are still raw after the Kavanaugh confirmation fight.

Republicans are still mulling an investigation into how Ford’s letter was leaked, and Democrats on Monday sent a letter to Grassley objecting to his decision to schedule nomination hearings during the Senate’s pre-election recess.

Grassley hasn't indicated whether he will try to move the 9th Circuit nominations, once they are formally submitted to the Senate, over Feinstein’s objections. It’s unclear if the Senate would be able to confirm them by the end of the year, or if Trump will need to renominate them in January when the new Congress is seated.

Bounds’s nomination was ultimately withdrawn when it became clear he was short of the votes needed to be confirmed.

Asked if the statement was an indication she would not return her blue slips, a spokeswoman declined on Monday to comment further.

Indeed, there were only 46 Obama-appointed U.S. attorneys left for Sessions to relieve because Obama appointees fully understood that this is the way things work. Many of them had already moved on, in the expectation that the president elected in November would replace them — an expectation that became a virtual certainty once it was clear that this change of administrations would be a change of parties, and visions.

It is frequently observed that, to be legitimate, law enforcement must operate independently of politics. It is an oversimplification, coupled with a misunderstanding of politics in its non-pejorative sense.

These policy choices are the stuff of politics. They often weigh heavily in presidential campaigns and elections. Law-and-order issues intimately affect people’s lives. When presidents make promises about them, they must expect to be held accountable.

U.S. attorneys are the instruments through which the president exercises his policy discretion. That is why they are political appointees. They do not have power of their own. Under our Constitution, all executive power is reposed in the president alone. Every officer of the executive branch is thus a delegate. The U.S. attorney exercises the president’s power and can be removed at the president’s will.

It is only natural, then, that a president will want his power wielded by his own appointees, whom he trusts to carry out his policy program.

President Donald Trump fired the nation 's acting attorney general Monday night after she refused to defend an executive order he issued last week restricting immigration in the name of national security .
In an act of high political drama just 10 days after taking office , Trump replaced Obama administration appointee Sally Yates with Dana Boente , the U.S. Attorney in Alexandria , Va .
`` The acting Attorney General , Sally Yates , has betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States . This order was approved as to form and legality by the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel , '' a White House statement said . `` Ms. Yates is an Obama Administration appointee who is weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration . ''
Yates could not be reached for comment on Trump 's attack , but a person close to her called the criticism from the White House absurd .
`` That 's preposterous . Everyone knows she 's a career prosecutor for nearly three decades , well-respected by serious members of both parties , '' said the Yates associate , who asked not to be named . `` That dog wo n't hunt . ''
`` She knew what she was doing and she knew she 'd be fired . She just wanted the publicity , '' said the aide , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
Despite sharp criticism of the wisdom of Trump ’ s move , there appears to be little doubt that under federal law Trump has legal authority to install any Senate-confirmed member of the Justice Department as the acting attorney general .
Yates , who was the No . 2 official at the department before Trump 's swearing-in and has been running the department since that time at Trump 's request , sent a memo Monday saying she doubts the wisdom and the legality of the directive blocking immigration from seven majority-Muslim countries .
`` My responsibility is to ensure that the position of the Department of Justice is not only legally defensible , but is informed by our best view of what the law is after consideration of all the facts . In addition , I am responsible for ensuring that the positions we take in court remain consistent with this institution ’ s solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right , '' Yates wrote in a memo released by the department earlier Monday .
`` At present , I am not convinced that the defense of the Executive Order is consistent with these responsibilities , nor am I convinced that the Executive Order is lawful , '' the acting Justice Department head said . `` For as long as I am the Acting Attorney General , the Department of Justice will not present arguments in defense of the Executive Order , unless and until I become convinced that it is appropriate to do so . ''
Some lawyers warned removing Yates could disrupt other department operations , including surveillance aimed at suspected terrorists . However , two officials said Monday night that as a Senate-confirmed official Boente could sign such orders .
Trump 's first reaction to Yates ' move came in a tweet earlier Monday evening .
`` The Democrats are delaying my Cabinet picks for purely political reasons . They have nothing going but to obstruct . Now have an Obama A.G. , '' Trump wrote , apparently accusing Yates of blocking his agenda . He did not complete the thought .
Trump 's removal of Yates had echoes of the so-called `` Saturday Night Massacre '' in 1973 , when Attorney General Elliot Richardson and Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus both resigned rather than comply with President Richard Nixon 's order to fire Watergate Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox . Solicitor General Robert Bork assumed the role of acting attorney general and complied with Nixon 's demand . The dismissal of someone who was investigating Nixon further undermined his credibility amid the burgeoning Watergate scandal.͝
Speaking on the Senate floor Monday night , Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer hailed Yates and dubbed her firing a `` Monday night massacre . ''
`` She was fired because she would not enact , pursue the executive order on the belief that it was illegal , perhaps unconstitutional , '' the New York Democrat said . `` It was a profile in courage . It was a brave act and a right act . ''
Schumer blasted the executive order as `` evil '' and faulted Trump aides for failing to clear the directive with relevant government agencies and top Cabinet officials . He also warned darkly of danger for the the country if the Trump continues to act rashly .
`` You just ca n't sit down , Twitter something out , then think , 'OK , let 's enact it . ' This is a complicated country , and when you do something as major as what the president proposed in his executive order , you got to think it through . You got to talk to people , '' Schumer said . `` How can you run a country like this ? ... If this continues , this country has big trouble . ''
The top Democrat on the House Judicial Committee , Rep. John Conyers of Michigan , also drew parallels to Nixon 's actions more than four decades ago .
`` President Trump has commenced a course of conduct that is Nixonian in its design and execution and threatens the long-vaunted independence of the Justice Department , '' Conyers said in a statement . `` If dedicated government officials deem his directives to be unlawful and unconstitutional , he will simply fire them as if government is a reality show . I call on my colleagues , regardless of party , to condemn this executive order and the reckless firing of our chief law enforcement officer. ``
There was little reaction from Republican lawmakers Monday night , but Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas made it clear he backed Trump 's move .
`` It is fitting -- and sad -- that the very last act of the Obama DOJ is for the acting AG to defy the newly elected POTUS , '' Cruz wrote on Twitter .

Boente was sworn in at about 9 p.m. Monday , according to a White House official who did not immediately provide details on who carried out the ceremony .
Boente quickly reversed Yates ’ DOJ memo Monday night on Trump ’ s executive order on immigration , saying the order was on solid ground .
“ Based upon the Office of Legal Counsel ’ s analysis , which found the Executive Order both lawful on its face and properly drafted , I hereby rescind former Acting Attorney General Sally Q. Yates January 30 , 2017 , guidance and direct the men and women of the Department of Justice to do our sworn duty and to defend the lawful orders of our President , ” Boente said in a statement .
Boente , who has served as a Justice Department attorney for more than 30 years , was nominated by President Barack Obama as the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia in 2015 and confirmed later that year . He has embraced his new role leading the department , according to a statement issued by the White House .
“ I am honored to serve President Trump in this role until Senator Sessions is confirmed . I will defend and enforce the laws of our country to ensure that our people and our nation are protected , ” Boente said . His statement did not address what stance he plans to take on Trump 's executive order .
Boente had led a number of prosecutions of political figures , including former Virginia Gov . Bob McDonnell and his wife . McDonnell 's bribery conviction was subsequently overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court .
Boente may not be in the position for long . Trump 's nominee for attorney general , Sen. Jeff Sessions ( R-Ala. ) , is scheduled for a vote Tuesday in the Senate Judiciary Committee . A floor vote on his nomination is expected in the following days , but the exact timing remains unclear .
Yates ' firing seems certain to prompt fiery rhetoric at Tuesday 's committee vote , which had been expected to go Sessions ' way without too much drama . However , there was no immediate indication the dramatic episode caused Sessions to shed any support .
Sessions ’ past comments to Yates at her confirmation hearing in 2015 also started getting attention overnight . The senator at the time pressed Yates about whether should would be willing to stand up to the president if he pushes the Justice Department to pursue policies or actions that don ’ t appear lawful .
`` You have to watch out because people will be asking you to do things and you need to say no . You think the attorney general has the responsibility to say no to the president if he asks for something that 's improper ? '' Sessions asked , adding , `` But if the views the president wants to execute are unlawful , should the attorney general or the deputy attorney general say no ? ''
Yates did not hesitate in her response , saying , `` Senator , I believe the attorney general or the deputy attorney general has an obligation to follow the law and the Constitution and to give their independent legal advice to the president . ''
The executive order Trump signed Friday temporarily halts travel to the U.S. by residents of seven countries , suspends new refugee approvals for 120 days and indefinitely shuts down the admission of Syrian refugees to the U.S. Another provision in the order gives Christians and other religious minorities in largely Muslim countries priority to immigrate to the United States .
Yates memo suggested she viewed the order as legally suspect not solely because of its wording but also because of statements Trump and others have made about it . Trump indicated in an interview last week that the order was intended to give Christians an advantage in the immigration process . An outside adviser to Trump , former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani , has said the order grew out of Trump 's effort to find a `` legal '' way to follow through on his campaign trail promise to ban Muslims from entering the U.S .
Yates ' order would have left the government with no authorized courtroom representation in several lawsuits and dozens of other court actions challenging Trump 's order and the way it was carried out by immigration authorities . At least one of the suits is currently seeking a broad restraining order against Trump 's directive .
Some lawyers criticized Yates ' memo , saying she had a legal duty to defend Trump 's executive order unless she decided there was no reasonable argument for its legality . Her statement stops short of saying that , indicating that she had not been convinced the order was lawful .
`` The typical standard for the Attorney General to defend an EO of the President is not whether she is convinced of its legality . Rather , the standard is something closer to the idea that she should defend the EO unless she is convinced of its illegality , '' Harvard Law Professor and former George W. Bush Justice Department official Jack Goldsmith wrote on the Lawfare blog .
Goldsmith called her statement `` unpersuasive '' and said the better course for her would have been to resign over her disagreement with the policy laid out in the order .
Yates spent more than a decade as a career prosecutor in Atlanta , before being appointed as the U.S. Attorney there by President Barack Obama in 2010 . Obama nominated her as deputy attorney general in 2014 and she assumed the role early the following year .
Most political appointees resigned or offered to resign with the change in administration , including Attorney General Loretta Lynch . However , the Justice Department announced a few days before Trump 's inauguration that he asked Yates to stay on as acting head of the department until a new attorney general was confirmed .","Trump fires defiant acting attorney general The Obama administration official serving as acting chief had instructed lawyers there not to defend President Trump's executive order.

Bush Justice Department official Jack Goldsmith wrote on the Lawfare blog.

Goldsmith called her statement ""unpersuasive"" and said the better course for her would have been to resign over her disagreement with the policy laid out in the order.

Yates spent more than a decade as a career prosecutor in Atlanta, before being appointed as the U.S. Attorney there by President Barack Obama in 2010. Obama nominated her as deputy attorney general in 2014 and she assumed the role early the following year.

Most political appointees resigned or offered to resign with the change in administration, including Attorney General Loretta Lynch. However, the Justice Department announced a few days before Trump's inauguration that he asked Yates to stay on as acting head of the department until a new attorney general was confirmed.

Historically oppressed or disadvantaged groups want payback.

Noah Rothman, a brilliant young writer and editor at Commentary magazine, has just published his first book, and it’s about nonsense.

Let me be clear: The book isn’t nonsense. It’s crisp, insightful, and passionate. The topic, captured in the title, Unjust: Social Justice and the Unmaking of America, is nonsense because social justice is nonsense.

Now, when I say “nonsense,” I mean nonsensical, as in lacking interior logic and definitional rigor. A few years ago, while working on my book The Tyranny of Clichés, I put on my prospector’s helmet and mined the literature for an agreed-upon definition of social justice. What I found was one deposit after another of fool’s gold. From labor unions to countless universities to gay-rights groups to even the American Nazi party, everyone insisted they were champions of social justice. The only disagreements hinged on who is most in need of this precious resource.

Common to almost every definition of social justice is some version of “economic justice,” which usually means what philosophers call “distributive justice” — i.e., taking money from the haves and giving it to the have-nots. But what it’s really about is power. Its advocates want the power to do what they want, and if they say it’s for social justice, that’s supposed to make it okay.

For instance, the Green party platform on social justice is nearly 60 pages (and 17,000 words) long. Among its planks: stopping speech that perpetuates “oppression and abuse,” reform of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, sovereignty for Hawaii, compensation for gays and lesbians who’ve suffered from “injustice,” the encouragement of young people’s potential “to the greatest extent possible,” and reinvestment of a “significant portion” of military spending on “family support, living-wage job development and work training programs.” Social justice isn’t a theory; it’s a wish list.

Judge Andrew S. Hanen said the lawyers knew the administration was approving amnesty applications but actively hid that information both from him and from the 26 states that had sued to stop the amnesty .
Worse yet , even after the court ordered a halt to the whole amnesty , the Department of Homeland Security approved several thousand more applications , in defiance of the court ’ s strict admonition , Judge Hanen said , counting at least four separate times the government ’ s attorneys misled him .
He even quoted from the scene in “ Miracle on 34th Street ” when the boy is called to testify to Santa ’ s existence and says everyone knows not to tell a lie to the court .

The failure of counsel to do that constituted more than mere inadvertent omissions — it was intentionally deceptive . ”
The spanking was the most serious rebuke — but by no means the only one — that Obama administration lawyers have faced at the hands of judges in recent months , and Judge Hanen questioned what was going on at the Justice Department to have reached this point .

Judge Hanen agreed , halting the amnesty just days before it was to begin accepting applications in February 2015 .
But in the months between November and February , the Department of Homeland Security had already begun approving three-year amnesties for so-called Dreamers , or young illegal immigrants who ’ d already qualified for two-year amnesties under a previous 2012 Obama policy . All told , more than 100,000 Dreamers ’ applications were approved during that time .
The government lawyers said they didn ’ t think the Dreamers ’ applications were an important part of the court case , arguing those should have been treated as a change to the 2012 policy , not part of the new 2014 policy .
They undercut their credibility , however , when several thousand more applications were approved in the weeks after Judge Hanen issued his February order halting the amnesty — something the government didn ’ t admit to until early March .
“ The decision of the lawyers who apparently determined that these three-year renewals under the 2014 DHS Directive were not covered by the Plaintiff States ’ pleadings was clearly unreasonable . The conduct of the lawyers who then covered up this decision was even worse , ” Judge Hanen wrote .
In court , the government lawyers had admitted they ’ d left the judge with the wrong impression and expressed regret and sorrow . But the government said it wasn ’ t intentional , and said it had taken steps to try to correct the problems — including going back and recapturing almost all of the amnesties approved or sent out after Judge Hanen ’ s February order officially halting the program .
They did not , however , cancel the 100,000 three-year amnesties approved between November and February .
Judge Hanen ordered the government to turn over a list of those names to the court , and said the 26 states that sued can move to get a look at the lists if they can prove damages stemming from any of those applications .
Judge Hanen thought about tossing all of the government ’ s arguments out , but said since the merits of the case are now pending before the Supreme Court , he couldn ’ t do that .

Gun-rights advocates took issue with the inclusion of firearms retailers in the list of non life-sustaining businesses , and argued that the mandatory closures violated state and federal constitutional protections and interfered with citizens ' Second Amendment rights . They brought their case before the state 's Supreme Court , but on Sunday , the seven-member court denied their request .
One of the three dissenting judges , Justice David Wecht , called the order an `` impermissible intrusion upon a fundamental constitutional right '' and pointed to other industries that have received exemption from the shutdown . An example would be restaurants in the state , which have been permitted to operate in some capacity through take-out and delivery options .
`` In my view , it is incumbent upon the Governor to make some manner of allowance for our citizens to continue to exercise this constitutional right , '' Wecht argued , making the case that gun stores could be permitted to operate in limited capacities . `` Such an accommodation may be effectuated while preserving sensible restrictions designed to slow the spread of COVID-19 , but nonetheless provide a legal avenue for the purchase and sale of firearms , thus avoiding an impermissible intrusion upon a fundamental constitutional right . ''
According to the Washington Free Beacon , Gov . Wolf argued that his order to close gun stores on an emergency basis `` does not abridge the right to bear arms '' because `` it merely suspends — temporarily — a variety of stores from acting as centers of contagion . ''
Adam Kraut , the director of legal strategy for the Firearms Policy Coalition and one of the lawyers representing the plaintiffs in the case , told the Free Beacon he is `` disappointed '' in the court 's decision , especially at a time `` when many are deciding that the ability to defends one 's home and family is more necessary than ever . ''
Kraut 's comments made reference to the national spike in gun sales in recent weeks .
`` The Governor 's Order amounts to an absolute and indefinite prohibition on the acquisition of firearms by citizens of the Commonwealth , '' Kraut continued . `` Such a prohibition can not withstand constitutional scrutiny and directly infringes upon the core of the Second Amendment . ''

Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf issued the executive order on March 19, which forced the shutdown of all businesses in the state deemed not ""life-sustaining"" for an indefinite period of time, gun stores included.

What are the details?

Gun-rights advocates took issue with the inclusion of firearms retailers in the list of non life-sustaining businesses, and argued that the mandatory closures violated state and federal constitutional protections and interfered with citizens' Second Amendment rights. They brought their case before the state's Supreme Court, but on Sunday, the seven-member court denied their request.

Anything else?

For most other products normally purchased in stores, consumers are now going online to purchase and having the products delivered to their door. But in Pennsylvania, residents don't have that option as it pertains to firearms.

Under Pennsylvania law, citizens are required to physically pick up guns purchased online at gun stores. So the executive order closing gun stores is effectively shutting down gun sales in the state.

But for all of Trump’s rebukes against an attorney general he has described as “beleaguered,” he knows firing Sessions would have dire political consequences.

“That is first and foremost what has driven the personnel situation,” said one White House official, who requested anonymity to speak candidly about the situation. “The president understands the media firestorm and political implications of a move at the top of [the Justice Department].”

Trump and Sessions are not known to speak frequently, but they did see each other this week for a meeting on election security, according to the White House.

The Justice Department declined to comment for this story.

It is not just political convenience that has saved Sessions’s job, according to his allies.

They say the attorney general has done a good job of staying focused on policy work while keeping a low public profile.

The former GOP senator from Alabama was one of Trump’s earliest campaign backers and shares the president's hard-line approach on immigration.

Sessions has made a series of announcements regarding crackdowns on criminal gangs like MS-13 and stopping illegal border crossings, including the so-called migrant caravan — all issues that Trump cares about deeply.

Trump raved to West Wing staff about a speech Sessions gave in March in which he chastised California officials over sanctuary cities, according to a White House official.

In the heated address, which was carried live on cable television, Sessions accused Golden State officials of being “radical extremists” and supporting “open borders.”

Firing Sessions would surely catch the attention of special counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) Swan MuellerSpeier says impeachment inquiry shows 'very strong case of bribery' by Trump Gowdy: I '100 percent' still believe public congressional hearings are 'a circus' Comey: Mueller 'didn't succeed in his mission because there was inadequate transparency' MORE, who reportedly wants to ask Trump in a potential interview about his attacks on the attorney general over his recusal from the federal investigation into Russian meddling in the presidential election. Trump has called Sessions’s decision a “terrible mistake” that made him reconsider choosing him as the nation’s top law enforcement official.

Trump’s comments, or actions, with regard to Sessions could be used to build a case that the president obstructed justice in the Russia probe.

Trump has never forgiven Sessions for recusing himself, and sources warned the mercurial president could get rid of his attorney general at any time, despite the possible repercussions.

“His tweets are very real,” the official said of Trump. “You’re not going to get a ton of ‘full confidence in Jeff Sessions’ from the podium. You’re going to get a lot of ‘we have no personnel announcements.’”

But when Trump does grow frustrated with Sessions over the Russia probe, White House chief of staff John Kelly John Francis KellyMORE has reminded the president about how the attorney general has helped him accomplish his agenda, which also includes going after opioid manufacturers and backing local law enforcement.

“Even as the president works through his frustration with Mueller, the bottom line is he understands Jeff has been one of his appointees in carrying out the policy promises the president made during the campaign,” said Ken Blackwell, a former Ohio secretary of state who served on Trump’s transition team and voter-fraud commission.

The New York Times reported that Sessions on a daily basis buys a $5.29 turkey sandwich for lunch from the Justice Department cafeteria, evidence he eschews the big-spending ways of some of his colleagues.

The praise campaign has not been entirely convincing to Trump, who views Sessions’s policy achievements and conduct as “secondary” to Russia-related matters, according to the White House official.

And Sessions’s role in the criminal investigation has returned to the spotlight, which could trigger a new round of speculation about his future.

Rudy Giuliani, who recently joined the president's legal team, implored Sessions to intervene in the Michael Cohen case by putting federal officials involved “under investigation.”

“I am waiting for the attorney general to step in, in his role as defender of justice,” the former New York City mayor told The Hill on Thursday, reacting to an incorrect report about a wiretap on Cohen, Trump’s longtime personal attorney. Federal investigators have been monitoring Cohen’s calls but were not recording their content, according to a corrected report by NBC News.

Sessions weeks before rebuffed demands for a second special counsel to probe conservative allegations of misconduct at the Justice Department, a decision that disappointed Trump allies in Congress.

Serving as the nation’s top law enforcement official is a lifelong dream for Sessions, a former U.S. attorney and Alabama attorney general. It is his best opportunity to fulfill his goal of imposing his law-and-order policy agenda.

That means Sessions has been willing absorb the verbal fusillade from Trump, who has blasted him on Twitter as “weak” and reportedly calls him “Mr. Magoo” behind closed doors.

“He loves that job and loves being in that job,” said Matthew Heiman, a former Justice Department official during the George W. Bush administration. “As long as he feels he can be an effective and good steward, he’s going to stay there.”

But Sessions has not taken every barb lying down. He reportedly submitted a resignation letter last year after Trump called him an “idiot” for recusing himself from the Russia probe. The president turned him down.

Sessions responded publicly after Trump labeled him “DISGRACEFUL” on Twitter over his handling of alleged surveillance abuses related to the 2016 campaign.

The attorney general said in a statement that the Justice Department “initiated the appropriate process” to look into the complaints and pledged to respond “fully and fairly.”

“As long as I am the attorney general, I will continue to discharge my duties with integrity and honor, and this department will continue to do its work in a fair and impartial manner according to the law and Constitution,” Sessions said.",www.thehill.com,center,eEJ9z9RWrTNnGOCo

He told reporters he ’ s seen “ no evidence ” of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians , and “ Democrats are lighting their hair on fire to get you to cover this story . ”
A White House official , in a statement , described Democrats ’ demands as a “ partisan ” attack , suggesting the controversy is timed to distract from the positive response to President Trump ’ s address to Congress earlier this week .
“ This is the latest attack against the Trump administration by partisan Democrats . [ Attorney General ] Sessions met with the ambassador in an official capacity as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee , which is entirely consistent with his testimony , ” the official said .
In a statement to Fox News , the former Alabama Republican senator said , `` I never met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign . I have no idea what this allegation is about . It is false . ''
While Sessions is denying he specifically discussed campaign issues with the Russians , The Washington Post first reported that he did speak twice last year with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak .

“ There was absolutely nothing misleading about his answer , ” Sessions spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said in a statement . “ Last year , the senator had over 25 conversations with foreign ambassadors as a senior member of the Armed Services Committee , including the British , Korean , Japanese , Polish , Indian , Chinese , Canadian , Australian , German and Russian ambassadors . He was asked during the hearing about communications between Russia and the Trump campaign -- not about meetings he took as a senator and a member of the Armed Services Committee . ”
According to a schedule provided to Fox News , Sessions had 30 meetings with numerous ambassadors from April 14 through Nov. 11 . Russia appears on the schedule only once – the Sept. 8 meeting with Kislyak . The day before , Sessions also took a meeting with Ukraine Ambassador Valeriy Chaly . These meetings took place a week before a seven-day unilateral ceasefire plan was accepted by Russia on behalf of separatist rebels it backed in the conflict with Ukraine .

Smollett insisted he was a victim of a racist and homophobic attack , but the city later determined that the alleged attack was nothing more than a hoax . Smollett faced 16 counts related to making false statements to police , but instead , the former “ Empire '' actor agreed to community service and a $ 10,000 fine in exchange for the charges to be dropped .

John Durham is the legendary lawman digging into how the intelligence probe of Donald Trump started .
John Durham may be the most consequential and least known figure in Washington right now .
In May , U.S. attorney general William Barr selected Durham , a longtime prosecutor with a résumé so sterling it nearly glows , to investigate the origins of the special counsel ’ s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election , and whether it was properly predicated . Some Trump fans believe there was a vast effort by a “ deep state ” of high-ranking intelligence and law-enforcement officials to smear Trump or hinder his campaign by creating a perception of corrupt ties to Russia . In late October , the New York Times quoted unnamed sources who said that Durham ’ s probe had officially become a criminal investigation , meaning he now has the power to subpoena for witness testimony and documents , to convene a grand jury , and to file criminal charges .
Since he is an attorney general appointed by President Trump , almost every decision from William Barr is criticized by Democrats as a partisan abuse of law-enforcement powers . But the appointment of Durham received no backlash , and in fact received praise far and wide .
Who is Durham , this rare-as-a-unicorn figure who can reassure lawmakers , talking heads , and court-watchers on both sides of the aisle , in an era when everything seems destined to turn into a loud partisan food fight ?
To say Durham is tight-lipped is an understatement ; he lets his courtroom arguments speak for him and rarely talks to reporters at all . Those who have covered him for years — or , more accurately , tried to cover him — say that when he does run into reporters , he is cordial but uninformative , and almost never on the record . In Durham ’ s questionnaire for the Senate while awaiting confirmation to be a U.S. Attorney , he was asked to list his written work . He answered that he had never written or published any books , articles , reports , or letters to the editor . ( The Senate confirmed him unanimously , with home-state senator Richard Blumenthal ( D. , Conn. ) calling him “ a fierce , fair prosecutor ” who “ dedicated his life to public service and the pursuit of justice. ” ) Durham is nicknamed , inevitably , “ the Bull , ” and his reputation makes clear he doesn ’ t take any of it from anyone .
Former attorney general Michael Mukasey , who appointed Durham to investigate the destruction of videotapes of CIA waterboarding , says he was recently contacted by a reporter in Connecticut who wanted to write a profile on Durham , whom the reporter said he knew . “ I called John to check the accuracy of that claim , and he confirmed that he knew the reporter but made it clear and specific that he had no use for personal profiles , ” Mukasey said . “ He thinks about the work , period — not about how it will be received in this or that quarter , or what caricatures people with a motive or a bias may draw of his work or of him . It is for that reason that I think he will be unaffected by the pressure of how his work will be received and how he will be portrayed — indeed , how some in the media have already started to portray him. ” Mukasey said Durham reminded him of the title of Franklin Roosevelt adviser Louis Brownlow ’ s autobiography , A Passion for Anonymity .
The only time Durham has offered public remarks on his work was in a March 2018 lecture at the University of St. Joseph in West Hartford , Conn. Durham was introduced by his friend of three decades and frequent prosecutorial partner , Leonard C. Boyle , the deputy chief state ’ s attorney in Connecticut , and Boyle observed , “ At least three members of the press are here tonight , because they probably realize that this may be their only chance to hear John speak about his work , other than in a courtroom . He ’ s notoriously shy about speaking about himself . ”
But in his subsequent remarks , Durham made it sound like his reticence to speak publicly wasn ’ t mere shyness so much as deliberate strategy to serve justice : “ One thing that I try to bear in mind , and try to encourage in new young prosecutors , particularly those who are making their bones or cutting their teeth , is an awareness of the incredible power that is wielded by law enforcement , and perhaps federal law enforcement in particular . Issuing a subpoena can destroy somebody ’ s reputation . It can damage their business , hurt their families . It is an awesome power that we have , that should only be used in appropriate instances . . . . It is as important for the system as for prosecutors to protect the secrecy of proceedings , not because we want them to be secret , but because we ’ re not always right . Maybe accusations that are lodged against somebody are untrue , and again we can destroy a person if that information gets out . ”
John Durham ’ s story in law enforcement starts all the way back in spring 1972 , when he spent four months as a patrol officer in Groton , Conn . He was in between his graduation from Colgate University and starting law school at the University of Connecticut . After law school , he spent two years as a legal intern at the Connecticut Planning Commission on Criminal Justice , and then spent two years as Volunteer in Service to America , the precursor to AmeriCorps . In his questionnaire for the Senate while awaiting confirmation to be U.S. Attorney , Durham wrote , “ my clients included principally the Crow Indian Tribe and individual members of the tribe . The focus was the protection of the natural resources belonging to the tribe as a whole and those possessed by individual tribal members . ”
His long career as a prosecutor began at the office of the chief state ’ s attorney of Connecticut in 1977 and switched from state to federal government in 1982 , when he joined the U.S. Department of Justice ’ s Organized Crime and Racketeering Section , working for the Boston Strike Force ’ s field office in New Haven . It was here that Durham started amassing an impressive collection of scalps in the courtroom , with enough colorful and notorious characters to fill seasons of a cable drama series about mobsters .
In 1984 , a federal grand jury indicted brothers Gus and Francis “ Fat Frannie ” Curcio on seven counts of extortion charges , contending that the two men were members of the Genovese crime family . At the time of the trial , Francis weighed more than 470 pounds . Durham was co-prosecutor , and the brothers attempted every trick in the book to get a mistrial declared . During the trial , Gus Curcio had an in-court medical “ episode ” that was purported to be a heart attack . The judge excused the jury and cleared the courtroom , and Curcio was taken by ambulance to Hartford Hospital , where doctors determined that there was nothing wrong with him . This led to another lengthy courtroom fight about whether he had been properly diagnosed .
The morning the trial had been scheduled to resume , prosecutors were told Francis Curcio had been injured in a motor-vehicle accident the night before . The circumstances were suspicious , to say the least . According to court records , “ while driving a 1975 Cadillac convertible , one of his older vehicles , Francis Curcio was struck broadside by a hit and run truck . The identity of the truck was never obtained and it was represented to the police that it had left the scene of the accident without its driver revealing his identity . However , shortly after the alleged accident , by coincidence , an acquaintance of Francis Curcio from Bridgeport happened upon the scene and Curcio was ultimately removed to the Bridgeport Hospital . The defendant complained of back pains rendering him unable to be present for the continuation of his trial . ”
Unbeknownst to the brothers , a federal wiretap had recorded other mob-connected figures John Gregory “ Buster ” Ardito , a capo in the Genovese crime family , and Vincent Pollina . The two men had discussed the Curcio case and expressed a desire for a mistrial , then discussed what drugs could simulate a heart attack , and according to a subsequent indictment , “ one or both of the Curcios taking a medication which he was advising them to take which when they went to court and took water , after having taken this medication , would immediately cause them to vomit . ”
Durham and his co-counsel won convictions of both Curcios on all counts , and then went after John Ardito and Pollina for obstruction of justice . Both were convicted and sentenced to five years in prison .
Year by year , Durham continued to rack up convictions in high-profile organized-crime cases . By 1986 , Durham was flying solo , prosecuting John Palazzolo , Joseph Gazzara , John Truncalli , and others as part of the Bonanno family of La Cosa Nostra , on accusations of stealing a cashier ’ s check worth $ 8.35 million from a New York financial institution . They were all convicted , and the case led to subsequent convictions of Palazzolo , a Bonanno capo . ( His father , James Palazzolo , boasted of becoming friends with Al Capone when Capone was sentenced to the federal prison in Atlanta in 1930 after being convicted of counterfeiting . ) The following year , Durham nailed several officials of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters for embezzling union health-plan funds .
David X. Sullivan , a longtime federal prosecutor who ’ s now running for Congress , joined the U.S. attorney ’ s office in New Haven in 1989 and worked alongside Durham for years .
“ John is a consummate professional — he never discusses the particulars of a case with anyone who doesn ’ t need to know about it , ” Sullivan said . “ John doesn ’ t need to raise his voice . He commands a lot of respect . When he spoke , people listened . When John did raise his voice , I ’ ll just say you felt his words . But he is just one of those people who , if you ran into him in elevator and had a conversation in passing , you would never know the authority he had or the weight on his shoulders . He ’ s strong but quiet . ”
By 1991 , Durham was leading the prosecution of the New England Family of La Cosa Nostra . One of the most notorious gangsters of the era , William “ The Wild Guy ” Grasso , had been murdered , shot in the back of the neck and his body dumped in a patch of poison ivy by the side of the Connecticut River in Wethersfield . Around the same time , Grasso ’ s right-hand man , “ Cadillac Frank ” Salemme , had been shot outside an International House of Pancakes but survived . The FBI and Durham rolled in , convicting seven high-profile mobsters , including boss Nicholas Bianco for 11 years and 5 months in prison for racketeering . The Hartford Courant called Durham “ an avenging angel ” who had put one third of Connecticut ’ s mafia in jail and never lost a case . In a six-year period , Durham racked up 119 organized-crime convictions .
Durham ’ s foes in the courtroom weren ’ t just the mafia . He won a conviction of William Dodge , leader of the Ku Klux Klan in southern New England , on charges of illegal possession of firearms , silencers , and explosives . During the trial of one of Dodge ’ s fellow Klansmen , Scott E. Palmer , Durham had a dramatic confrontation with a Roman Catholic priest , the Reverend Mark R. Jette , who had testified that Palmer had reformed his hateful ways . “ He is confident Scott Palmer has seen the error of his ways ? ” Durham asked , according to press accounts . He then presented two drawings Palmer had made in prison . The first was a skull and crossbones with the words , “ White Power , ” and a note saying , “ Kill all the n * * * * * s for Santa Claus. ” The other “ appeared to be an oval-shaped insignia . At the top was ‘ LYNCH MOB ’ and at the bottom was ‘ WALLINGFORD CT. ’ In the middle was a noose and a fiery cross. ” The judge found Durham ’ s presentation of the sketches more compelling than the reverend and sentenced Palmer to the maximum 63 months on federal weapons charges .
Durham and law enforcement rounded up 42 members of the Puerto Rican street gang Los Solidos and put them all away for long sentences with convictions and guilty pleas . The Solidos ’ crimes were the kind that could make hard men lay awake at night : In a case of mistaken identity , a group of Solidos mistook a gray Toyota driven a Hartford mechanic for the similar car of a rival gang member in Charter Oak Terrace housing project and opened fire . They shot the mechanic ’ s seven-year-old daughter , Marcelina Delgado , in the head . Every gang member charged in the murder was sentenced to life in prison .
By 2000 , Durham had built a reputation as one of the country ’ s best prosecutors , and he got the call from FBI director Louis Freeh and Attorney General Janet Reno to handle one of the Department of Justice ’ s most infamous cases : the claim that FBI agents had protected notorious Boston gangster Whitey Bulger , even as Bulger continued to commit violent crimes . This was a jaw-dropping tale of corruption that later inspired the film The Departed and was also dramatized in Black Mass .
U.S. Attorney Donald Stern had recommended Durham for the job , and he told the Associated Press in an interview years later , “ We didn ’ t go to Washington with a list . We went to Washington and said , ‘ We want John Durham to do it . ’ ”
“ John Le Carré wrote in The Russia House , ‘ Some things are necessary evils , some things are more evil than necessary. ’ That is the fundamental question of what was going on in Boston , ” Durham said in his lecture at the University of St. Joseph .
The Boston scandal represented the Bureau ’ s nightmare scenario . FBI special agent John Connolly Jr. had grown up in South Boston with mobsters James “ Whitey ” Bulger and Stephen “ The Rifleman ” Flemmi , as well as Whitey Bulger ’ s younger brother William Bulger , who was elected to the state house in 1960 and state senate in 1970 .
Connolly had applied to the FBI and been turned down , but on August 1 , 1968 , John McCormack , then the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives and part of the Boston political machine , wrote a letter to his friend the FBI director , J. Edgar Hoover , touting Connolly ’ s attributes . Another letter followed in October . The day after the second letter , Hoover replied that Connolly would become a special agent , and Connolly was transferred to Boston in 1973 . It is unusual for an agent to work in his old home city so early in his career , but Connolly had made a name for himself by tracking down and arresting Patriarca crime-family hitman “ Cadillac ” Frank Salemme in Manhattan the previous year — the same infamous gangster who would end up getting shot outside the International House of Pancakes decades later , whose assailants would be prosecuted by Durham .
“ Connolly ’ s forte was not investigating cases , he wasn ’ t doing bank robberies or white-collar crime or the like , ” Durham said in his speech at University of St. Joseph . “ He had some interest in organized crime and recruiting informants . He makes his way back to Boston , and Connolly approaches [ then state senator ] Billy Bulger , who he appreciated for his political help , and asks what he can do for him to thank him for all the help he had provided . ‘ Keep my brother out of trouble , ’ he said , meaning Whitey Bulger . ”
Around 1975 , Connolly recruited Whitey Bulger and Stephen Flemmi to work as “ top echelon informants ” for the FBI , with the approval of Connolly ’ s supervisor , John Morris . They formed a devil ’ s alliance , with Bulger mostly providing information that led to arrests against the Italian mob , La Cosa Nostra , but left the Irish mob mostly intact . Meanwhile , Connolly leaked information that kept Bulger one step ahead of the Massachusetts State Police , the DEA , and any other law-enforcement effort against him . “ The FBI had plenty of regulations and policies in place , ” Durham said in his speech . “ While the LCN was playing checkers , the Irish were playing chess . The number-one priority of the FBI at the time was taking down the LCN in the United States . [ Bulger and his associates ] had the keys to the kingdom , all the organized-crime information in Boston . ”
The result was a pair of gangsters terrorizing Boston with an effective get-out-of-jail free card . “ Steve Flemmi claimed that he had been told by the FBI supervisor , John Morris , that ‘ you can commit any crime you want as long as you don ’ t clip anyone , ’ meaning as long as you don ’ t kill anyone , ” Durham said . “ The indictment had extortion , illegal gambling , loansharking , use of violence and so forth , and his claim was that he and Bulger were authorized to do that. ” The pair committed multiple murders anyway .
As the relationship continued , Connolly accepted cash and expensive cases of wine , and leaked information that led to the killing of three witnesses . He also warned Bulger about a federal indictment in 1994 , prompting Bulger to go on the run . He was put on the FBI ’ s Most Wanted List , listed with the second-highest amount of reward money next to Osama bin Laden , and he remained at large for 16 years .
“ As part of the law-enforcement tools that we have , [ the use of informants is ] a very powerful one , particularly when investigating organizations of violent individuals , like the Irish mafia up in Boston , or La Cosa Nostra , ” Durham said . “ It is true that oftentimes the only way you can attack those organizations is through the use of informants . But the damage that can be done when law enforcement or prosecutors misuse these tools is difficult to overstate . ”
At the trial , Durham argued that Connolly “ functioned as a member of a criminal enterprise . . . John Connolly knew what his obligations were , but he was on somebody else ’ s team. ” Connolly was convicted of obstruction of justice and racketeering and sentenced to ten years , the maximum under federal guidelines , and later was charged with providing information to Flemmi and Bulger that led to the 1982 murder of a Miami businessman . Connolly received a separate 40-year prison sentence in Florida . Flemmi pleaded guilty to racketeering and ten murders and is serving a life sentence .
William Bulger went on to become the president of the Massachusetts state senate and president of the University of Massachusetts , and in the early 2000s he faced public criticism that he had not disclosed conversations with his fugitive brother to law enforcement . Asked whether he believed William Bulger really didn ’ t know where his brother was hiding , Durham said , “ How much did he know ? Probably a lot more than we can prove , but that ’ s speculation . ”
The Boston FBI investigation and the Connolly prosecution proved Durham could step into a legal and political hurricane and follow the evidence , no matter how embarrassing it turned out to be to the people who had appointed him .
‘ Not a Man Who Is Motivated or Influenced by a Political Agenda ’
At some point , some particularly ill-informed critic of the administration may try to paint Durham as a right-wing hack or Republican loyalist . If so , Durham would be the rare kind of right-wing hack who helped send Connecticut ’ s three-term GOP governor , John Rowland , to prison . At the beginning of his third term , Rowland faced accusations that he sold a Washington , D.C. , condominium at an inflated price and that state contractors had given him a sweetheart deal on improvements to his weekend home . By the end of the year , Rowland admitted that he had paid nothing for the work but pledged to pay the full price . Kevin O ’ Connor , the U.S. Attorney for Connecticut , had been a political ally of Rowland , and his wife had briefly worked for the governor . O ’ Connor recused himself , leaving the case in Durham ’ s hands .
The governor ’ s deputy chief of staff , Lawrence Alibozek , had developed a notorious reputation for bribery . The 22-page indictment against him listed bribes ranging from envelopes of cash , limousine rides , stays at posh hotels , and , in a detail right out of a novel , $ 10,000 in gold coins . Alibozek provided authorities with a roadmap of all the illicit deals in the Rowland administration and was spared prison , sentenced to a year of home confinement and five years of probation . His case was prosecuted by then–assistant U.S. Attorney Nora Dannehy , who has joined Durham in his current probe into the start of the Trump investigation . Durham supervised the negotiations of the resolution of the governor ’ s case , which led to Rowland ’ s guilty plea and subsequent term of imprisonment of one year and one day .
Durham is a registered Republican , but there ’ s no indication that he even blinked at the prospect of taking down the most prominent GOP official in the state . His longtime colleague Sullivan said , “ I ’ m a little disheartened now when I start to see people attacking John in the press about his present assignment , because I truly know , in my heart , dealing with him for 30 years , that John Durham is not a man who is motivated or influenced by a political agenda . ”
‘ You ’ re the Only Things Standing between the CIA and an FBI Raid ’
In 2008 , then–attorney general Mukasey found himself with the challenge of investigating reports that the Central Intelligence Agency had destroyed videotapes of waterboarding sessions on captured detainees . Durham was one of a small handful of prosecutors Mukasey interviewed .
“ The one story I heard about him at the time was that there had been a Hartford Courant article about him that mentioned him going to Mass three or four times a week , and that he had gotten a call from his mother wanting to know what about the other days , ” Mukasey said . The former attorney general recalls that unlike the other prosecutors interviewed , Durham said he had no plans to keep the public informed about the progress of his work . Once again , his work in the courtroom would speak for itself .
Robert L. Deitz was senior counsel to then–CIA director Michael Hayden from 2006 until February 2009 and handled many negotiations with Durham during the investigation into the tapes . Deitz remembers Durham being “ thoroughly professional and honest. ” He jokes that despite being nicknamed “ The Bull , ” Durham was rarely disagreeable or difficult . “ Oh , he ’ s a pussycat — very nice , very funny . Good sense of humor . If you were sarcastic , he understood you were being sarcastic . He ’ s such a straight shooter and a fair person . ”
But whether Durham is more accurately compared to a bull or a pussycat , he could bare his teeth . “ One day he came storming into my office at the agency , almost yelling — which was very uncharacteristic for him — and he said something like , ‘ Bob , you ’ re the only thing standing between the CIA and an FBI raid ! ’ I was taken aback and surprised . He believed he was being jerked around by certain people at the agency , and it wasn ’ t an entirely wrong belief . I ended up talking to him at length and then taking care of the problem . ”
Once he was investigating the destruction of the tapes , Durham didn ’ t discuss his work with Mukasey . Durham worked on his probe for three years in methodical and exhausting fashion . Unnamed sources told the Washington Post that Durham brought CIA lawyers , operatives , and others before a federal grand jury and probed for inconsistencies in their accounts ; some witnesses testified four or five times . As the attorney general recalls it , there was no issue with cooperation from the CIA ; then-director Michael Hayden “ was well aware of the need to cooperate and that Durham would act with scrupulous fairness . His conclusion — that no prosecution was warranted in the circumstances — was never disputed by anyone . ”
In August 2009 , Attorney General Eric Holder expanded Durham ’ s mandate to see if any CIA officials who used “ enhanced interrogation techniques ” should be charged with crimes . By June 2011 , Durham recommended opening full criminal investigations regarding the death of two individuals while in United States custody at overseas locations , and closing the remaining matters . A year later , the Department of Justice decided not to press charges in those cases , either . Holder declared that Durham had investigated every angle as thoroughly as humanly possible . “ Mr . Durham and his team of agents and prosecutors have worked tirelessly to conduct extraordinarily thorough and complete preliminary reviews and investigations . I am grateful to his team and to him for their commitment to ensuring that the preliminary review and the subsequent investigations fully examined a broad universe of allegations from multiple sources . I continue to believe that our nation will be better for it . ”
The lack of criticism for Durham ’ s decision in the CIA cases is a bit surprising , considering how routinely the agency was denounced by lawmakers , commentators , and activists , particularly at that time . The Department of Justice never elaborated on why Durham didn ’ t recommend charges in the destruction of the tapes , but one complication was that the burning of the 92 tapes on November 9 , 2005 , was authorized in a cable sent by Jose Rodriguez Jr. , head of the agency ’ s directorate of operations . Another clue came in a Washington Post article , again quoting unidentified sources saying , “ authorities found it difficult to pinpoint the motivation for destroying the tapes , and that it was difficult to prove criminal intent . ”
In his speech at University of St. Joseph , Durham did not discuss his investigation of the tapes , but he did discuss the prosecutor ’ s calculus of when charges are warranted , which likely applied in this decision . “ You are only authorized to bring a prosecution if you believe , based upon the evidence that you have , that you are likely to be able to prove a case not to the probable cause standard , which is all that is required to arrest somebody , but if you believe you can prosecute the case and prove that case beyond a reasonable doubt , and beyond that , that you would be able to sustain that conviction on appeal , ” Durham said . “ And if you can ’ t say , in all honesty , that you would be able to do that , then prosecution is not warranted . When on the nightly news , you ’ re watching what Bob Mueller is doing , and so forth , however that investigation turns out , whatever Mr. Mueller and his colleague conclude , if it ’ s not satisfactory to the public , it may very well be because Bob Mueller is an honorable man who applies those principles of law as he ’ s been taught and as he ’ s taught to others . ”
“ Durham was not just saying , ‘ Do I have enough here that I could actually get a prosecution ? ’ , ” Deitz said . “ But ‘ Do I have enough here to justify — legally , morally , societally — this person ’ s conviction ? ’ That ’ s another reason why I admire him . ”
As if all of this weren ’ t enough , Durham had a hand in coming close to cracking one of the biggest criminal mysteries in modern American history , the 1990 robbery of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston . In that notorious heist , paintings worth $ 500 million were stolen , including works by Vermeer and Manet , three Rembrandt paintings , and five sketches by Degas — the most expensive loot haul of any crime in American history .
In 2010 , Elene Guarente , the widow of Boston mob associate Bobby Guarente , told the FBI that six years earlier , her mob-associated husband had handed over several of the museum ’ s stolen masterpieces to his best friend , Robert Gentile , in a seafood-restaurant parking lot in Portland , Maine . This put the septuagenarian Gentile on the radar of the FBI , and by 2013 he was imprisoned after convictions for weapons possession and illegal sale of prescription narcotics . Investigators dug through his property and underneath a shed in his backyard , looking for clues to the theft , and found what appeared to be a price list for each of the items . In 2015 , Durham revealed in U.S. District Court that Gentile had been recorded negotiating the sale of stolen Gardner paintings with an undercover operative . Gentile denied all the allegations , arguing that if he ’ d had any of the paintings , he would have turned them in for the reward money . Prosecutors also revealed that Gentile had failed a polygraph test when he denied having advance knowledge of the Gardner heist , ever possessing a Gardner painting , or knowing the location of any of the stolen paintings . Alas , Gentile stuck to his denials and served out his sentence . The 82-year-old felon was released in March of this year , contending to the Hartford Courant ’ s Edmund Mahony that the FBI and prosecutors “ ruined my life . ”
‘ I Don ’ t Worry about the Mafia . There Are Actual Rules Here . ’
Durham established himself as the go-to guy when the country ’ s top law-enforcement and intelligence agencies need to investigate themselves diligently , thoroughly , and fairly . According to the New York Times , Durham spent part of 2017 investigating James A. Baker , the former top lawyer at the FBI , over a suspected leak of classified information . This leak was not related to the Russia investigation or the Steele dossier , according to Robert Litt , the former counsel to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence , who was interviewed by Durham as part of the investigation . To avoid the perception that the FBI was investigating itself , Durham used U.S . Postal Service inspectors as his staff . Durham wrapped up the investigation in December of that year and concluded that no criminal charges were warranted .
Throughout all these high-profile cases , Durham remained an exceptionally private figure . Sullivan calls him “ an avid Boston Red Sox fan ” and a devout Catholic . While introducing Durham at the University of Saint Joseph speech , Boyle mocked Durham ’ s one discernible flaw , a questionable fashion sense : “ John wears a suit to work every day — dark suit , light shirt , modest tie . You would think it wouldn ’ t be that hard , ” Boyle said . “ When you buy the suit , the jacket and pants come together . John seems to have an unfailing ability to mismatch the jacket and trousers . His wife puts tags on his clothes to match them , yet he still gets it wrong — he goes out the door , he doesn ’ t take the opportunity to look in the mirror , and then when standing in a courtroom , only then does he realize he wore the grey striped jacket and navy blue checked pants . I ’ ve wondered if jurors wonder , ‘ Do you think that guy does that on purpose ? ’ ”
Asked whether he feels safe while prosecuting violent criminal originations , Durham replied , “ I ’ m okay . . . personally , I don ’ t worry so much about like , the Mafia . I mean , there are some actual rules here . Speaking for myself , I ’ m not sure for a lot of other prosecutors , what you worry about is a person you don ’ t know about , somebody crazy . They ’ re not an obvious threat to you . One of my sons is a prosecutor , and he ’ s prosecuting these MS-13 people . That causes me some concern for him . ”
In September , Durham and Attorney General Barr flew to Rome with inquiries for the Italian government about the beginning of the probe into Trump . Working with Barr has prompted some commentators on the left to suddenly reevaluate Durham ’ s previously impeccable reputation .
Matthew A. Miller , who was the director of the Obama Justice Department ’ s public-affairs office from 2009 to 2011 , speculated to Andrea Mitchell that Durham had been reduced to a pawn : “ I don ’ t think John Durham is in charge of this investigation. ” Earlier this year , Miller wrote , “ One thing about Durham : he moves incredibly slowly . I ’ d be shocked if he is done before November 2020 , meaning Trump will be able to attack the FBI as being under a cloud throughout the campaign . All part of the plan. ” ( One of Miller ’ s duties at the department had been announcing that Durham would not press charges in the CIA-videotape investigation . )
Sherrilyn Ifill , the president of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund , contended that Trump has somehow tainted or corrupted Durham : “ Those who have expressed their faith in John Durham ’ s professionalism & long years of government service would do well to remember that many expressed confidence in [ Attorney General ] Barr and [ former Deputy Attorney General Rod ] Rosenstein for the same reasons . Working for Trump does not change you — it reveals you . We shall see . But be prepared . ”
On Capitol Hill , Democrats such as Representative Jerrold Nadler ( N.Y. ) , Representative Adam Schiff ( Calif. ) , and Senator Mark Warner ( Va. ) haven ’ t criticized Durham by name but have made statements expressing fears that the Department of Justice has “ become a vehicle for President Trump ’ s political revenge ” or “ a tool of political retribution . ”
George Papadopoulos is the former low-level Trump-campaign foreign-policy adviser who became a major player in the FBI ’ s investigation into the campaign ’ s ties to Russia and pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators . For what it ’ s worth , he thinks Durham will eventually reveal bombshells . Papadopoulos wrote on Twitter . “ For anyone who thinks that AG Barr and John Durham are on a fishing expedition around the world following ‘ conspiracy theories , ’ I have a bridge to sell you in the Sahara . Their findings will change world history . ”
Barr may well know that Durham ’ s reputation will make any indictment that comes down the pike credible and not easily dismissed as a partisan exercise . On October 28 , Barr did a rare televised interview and said of Durham , “ He ’ s a 35-year veteran of the department . Great reputation for non-partisanship . He ’ s a by-the-book kind of guy . He ’ s thorough and fair . And I ’ m confident he ’ s going to get to the bottom of things . ”
Mukasey notes that Durham chose Nora Dannehy , who was part of the team making the cases against Governor Rowland ’ s administration all those years ago , as his counsel in the current investigation of the Trump probe . Back in 2008 , Mukasey chose her to investigate the controversial firing of seven U.S . Attorneys two years earlier . She concluded that the firings were inappropriately political but not criminal , and that there was insufficient evidence to charge anyone with lying to Congress or investigators . “ She , too , went about her work quietly , and has a reputation similar to Durham ’ s for skill and an intense dedication to doing the job , ” Mukasey said . “ I can ’ t think of two people I would rather have in charge of this investigation . ”
From all this , we can surmise a few things about Durham ’ s ongoing investigation into the launch of the probe of Donald Trump and his potential connections to Russia during the 2016 campaign . Durham will not speak to the press at all until he is done , and probably not even then . He and his team are extremely unlikely to leak . He is not afraid to reach conclusions that will disappoint or frustrate Attorney General Barr or President Trump . He will not be rushed ; there is no guarantee that Durham will reach any prosecutorial decisions before the 2020 elections . And he will investigate so extensively and thoroughly that no reasonable observer will be able to argue that something important was missed . As Sullivan describes Durham , “ He will be in constant pursuit of the truth and the facts and the evidence . John doesn ’ t take days off . He is methodical , but he is always working . ”
If Durham chooses to bring charges against any official who launched the Trump probe , history suggests he is extremely likely to persuade a jury to convict the accused and sustain those convictions upon appeal . And if he does not bring charges , it is extremely unlikely that any other prosecutor could have succeeded ; regardless of what the official did , the evidence would not be there to convict or sustain a conviction .
John Durham ’ s career is full of big , high-stakes , politically charged cases , but this one is the biggest , highest-stakes , and most politically charged of all . Luckily , it seems like his whole life has prepared him for this moment .

John Durham is the legendary lawman digging into how the intelligence probe of Donald Trump started.

John Durham may be the most consequential and least known figure in Washington right now.

In May, U.S. attorney general William Barr selected Durham, a longtime prosecutor with a résumé so sterling it nearly glows, to investigate the origins of the special counsel’s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election, and whether it was properly predicated. Some Trump fans believe there was a vast effort by a “deep state” of high-ranking intelligence and law-enforcement officials to smear Trump or hinder his campaign by creating a perception of corrupt ties to Russia. In late October, the New York Times quoted unnamed sources who said that Durham’s probe had officially become a criminal investigation, meaning he now has the power to subpoena for witness testimony and documents, to convene a grand jury, and to file criminal charges.

Since he is an attorney general appointed by President Trump, almost every decision from William Barr is criticized by Democrats as a partisan abuse of law-enforcement powers. But the appointment of Durham received no backlash, and in fact received praise far and wide.

Who is Durham, this rare-as-a-unicorn figure who can reassure lawmakers, talking heads, and court-watchers on both sides of the aisle, in an era when everything seems destined to turn into a loud partisan food fight?

To say Durham is tight-lipped is an understatement; he lets his courtroom arguments speak for him and rarely talks to reporters at all. Those who have covered him for years — or, more accurately, tried to cover him — say that when he does run into reporters, he is cordial but uninformative, and almost never on the record. In Durham’s questionnaire for the Senate while awaiting confirmation to be a U.S. Attorney, he was asked to list his written work. He answered that he had never written or published any books, articles, reports, or letters to the editor. (The Senate confirmed him unanimously, with home-state senator Richard Blumenthal (D., Conn.) calling him “a fierce, fair prosecutor” who “dedicated his life to public service and the pursuit of justice.”) Durham is nicknamed, inevitably, “the Bull,” and his reputation makes clear he doesn’t take any of it from anyone.

‘A Passion for Anonymity’

Former attorney general Michael Mukasey, who appointed Durham to investigate the destruction of videotapes of CIA waterboarding, says he was recently contacted by a reporter in Connecticut who wanted to write a profile on Durham, whom the reporter said he knew. “I called John to check the accuracy of that claim, and he confirmed that he knew the reporter but made it clear and specific that he had no use for personal profiles,” Mukasey said. “He thinks about the work, period — not about how it will be received in this or that quarter, or what caricatures people with a motive or a bias may draw of his work or of him. It is for that reason that I think he will be unaffected by the pressure of how his work will be received and how he will be portrayed — indeed, how some in the media have already started to portray him.” Mukasey said Durham reminded him of the title of Franklin Roosevelt adviser Louis Brownlow’s autobiography, A Passion for Anonymity.

The only time Durham has offered public remarks on his work was in a March 2018 lecture at the University of St. Joseph in West Hartford, Conn. Durham was introduced by his friend of three decades and frequent prosecutorial partner, Leonard C. Boyle, the deputy chief state’s attorney in Connecticut, and Boyle observed, “At least three members of the press are here tonight, because they probably realize that this may be their only chance to hear John speak about his work, other than in a courtroom. He’s notoriously shy about speaking about himself.”

But in his subsequent remarks, Durham made it sound like his reticence to speak publicly wasn’t mere shyness so much as deliberate strategy to serve justice: “One thing that I try to bear in mind, and try to encourage in new young prosecutors, particularly those who are making their bones or cutting their teeth, is an awareness of the incredible power that is wielded by law enforcement, and perhaps federal law enforcement in particular. Issuing a subpoena can destroy somebody’s reputation. It can damage their business, hurt their families. It is an awesome power that we have, that should only be used in appropriate instances. . . . It is as important for the system as for prosecutors to protect the secrecy of proceedings, not because we want them to be secret, but because we’re not always right. Maybe accusations that are lodged against somebody are untrue, and again we can destroy a person if that information gets out.”

Fat Frannie, Buster, the Wild Guy, and Cadillac Frank

John Durham’s story in law enforcement starts all the way back in spring 1972, when he spent four months as a patrol officer in Groton, Conn. He was in between his graduation from Colgate University and starting law school at the University of Connecticut. After law school, he spent two years as a legal intern at the Connecticut Planning Commission on Criminal Justice, and then spent two years as Volunteer in Service to America, the precursor to AmeriCorps. In his questionnaire for the Senate while awaiting confirmation to be U.S. Attorney, Durham wrote, “my clients included principally the Crow Indian Tribe and individual members of the tribe. The focus was the protection of the natural resources belonging to the tribe as a whole and those possessed by individual tribal members.”

His long career as a prosecutor began at the office of the chief state’s attorney of Connecticut in 1977 and switched from state to federal government in 1982, when he joined the U.S. Department of Justice’s Organized Crime and Racketeering Section, working for the Boston Strike Force’s field office in New Haven. It was here that Durham started amassing an impressive collection of scalps in the courtroom, with enough colorful and notorious characters to fill seasons of a cable drama series about mobsters.

In 1984, a federal grand jury indicted brothers Gus and Francis “Fat Frannie” Curcio on seven counts of extortion charges, contending that the two men were members of the Genovese crime family. At the time of the trial, Francis weighed more than 470 pounds. Durham was co-prosecutor, and the brothers attempted every trick in the book to get a mistrial declared. During the trial, Gus Curcio had an in-court medical “episode” that was purported to be a heart attack. The judge excused the jury and cleared the courtroom, and Curcio was taken by ambulance to Hartford Hospital, where doctors determined that there was nothing wrong with him. This led to another lengthy courtroom fight about whether he had been properly diagnosed.

The morning the trial had been scheduled to resume, prosecutors were told Francis Curcio had been injured in a motor-vehicle accident the night before. The circumstances were suspicious, to say the least. According to court records, “while driving a 1975 Cadillac convertible, one of his older vehicles, Francis Curcio was struck broadside by a hit and run truck. The identity of the truck was never obtained and it was represented to the police that it had left the scene of the accident without its driver revealing his identity. However, shortly after the alleged accident, by coincidence, an acquaintance of Francis Curcio from Bridgeport happened upon the scene and Curcio was ultimately removed to the Bridgeport Hospital. The defendant complained of back pains rendering him unable to be present for the continuation of his trial.”

Unbeknownst to the brothers, a federal wiretap had recorded other mob-connected figures John Gregory “Buster” Ardito, a capo in the Genovese crime family, and Vincent Pollina. The two men had discussed the Curcio case and expressed a desire for a mistrial, then discussed what drugs could simulate a heart attack, and according to a subsequent indictment, “one or both of the Curcios taking a medication which he was advising them to take which when they went to court and took water, after having taken this medication, would immediately cause them to vomit.”

Durham and his co-counsel won convictions of both Curcios on all counts, and then went after John Ardito and Pollina for obstruction of justice. Both were convicted and sentenced to five years in prison.

Year by year, Durham continued to rack up convictions in high-profile organized-crime cases. By 1986, Durham was flying solo, prosecuting John Palazzolo, Joseph Gazzara, John Truncalli, and others as part of the Bonanno family of La Cosa Nostra, on accusations of stealing a cashier’s check worth $8.35 million from a New York financial institution. They were all convicted, and the case led to subsequent convictions of Palazzolo, a Bonanno capo. (His father, James Palazzolo, boasted of becoming friends with Al Capone when Capone was sentenced to the federal prison in Atlanta in 1930 after being convicted of counterfeiting.) The following year, Durham nailed several officials of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters for embezzling union health-plan funds.

David X. Sullivan, a longtime federal prosecutor who’s now running for Congress, joined the U.S. attorney’s office in New Haven in 1989 and worked alongside Durham for years.

“John is a consummate professional — he never discusses the particulars of a case with anyone who doesn’t need to know about it,” Sullivan said. “John doesn’t need to raise his voice. He commands a lot of respect. When he spoke, people listened. When John did raise his voice, I’ll just say you felt his words. But he is just one of those people who, if you ran into him in elevator and had a conversation in passing, you would never know the authority he had or the weight on his shoulders. He’s strong but quiet.”

By 1991, Durham was leading the prosecution of the New England Family of La Cosa Nostra. One of the most notorious gangsters of the era, William “The Wild Guy” Grasso, had been murdered, shot in the back of the neck and his body dumped in a patch of poison ivy by the side of the Connecticut River in Wethersfield. Around the same time, Grasso’s right-hand man, “Cadillac Frank” Salemme, had been shot outside an International House of Pancakes but survived. The FBI and Durham rolled in, convicting seven high-profile mobsters, including boss Nicholas Bianco for 11 years and 5 months in prison for racketeering. The Hartford Courant called Durham “an avenging angel” who had put one third of Connecticut’s mafia in jail and never lost a case. In a six-year period, Durham racked up 119 organized-crime convictions.

Durham’s foes in the courtroom weren’t just the mafia. He won a conviction of William Dodge, leader of the Ku Klux Klan in southern New England, on charges of illegal possession of firearms, silencers, and explosives. During the trial of one of Dodge’s fellow Klansmen, Scott E. Palmer, Durham had a dramatic confrontation with a Roman Catholic priest, the Reverend Mark R. Jette, who had testified that Palmer had reformed his hateful ways. “He is confident Scott Palmer has seen the error of his ways?” Durham asked, according to press accounts. He then presented two drawings Palmer had made in prison. The first was a skull and crossbones with the words, “White Power,” and a note saying, “Kill all the n*****s for Santa Claus.” The other “appeared to be an oval-shaped insignia. At the top was ‘LYNCH MOB’ and at the bottom was ‘WALLINGFORD CT.’ In the middle was a noose and a fiery cross.” The judge found Durham’s presentation of the sketches more compelling than the reverend and sentenced Palmer to the maximum 63 months on federal weapons charges.

Durham and law enforcement rounded up 42 members of the Puerto Rican street gang Los Solidos and put them all away for long sentences with convictions and guilty pleas. The Solidos’ crimes were the kind that could make hard men lay awake at night: In a case of mistaken identity, a group of Solidos mistook a gray Toyota driven a Hartford mechanic for the similar car of a rival gang member in Charter Oak Terrace housing project and opened fire. They shot the mechanic’s seven-year-old daughter, Marcelina Delgado, in the head. Every gang member charged in the murder was sentenced to life in prison.

‘Some Things Are More Evil Than Necessary’

By 2000, Durham had built a reputation as one of the country’s best prosecutors, and he got the call from FBI director Louis Freeh and Attorney General Janet Reno to handle one of the Department of Justice’s most infamous cases: the claim that FBI agents had protected notorious Boston gangster Whitey Bulger, even as Bulger continued to commit violent crimes. This was a jaw-dropping tale of corruption that later inspired the film The Departed and was also dramatized in Black Mass.

U.S. Attorney Donald Stern had recommended Durham for the job, and he told the Associated Press in an interview years later, “We didn’t go to Washington with a list. We went to Washington and said, ‘We want John Durham to do it.’”

“John Le Carré wrote in The Russia House, ‘Some things are necessary evils, some things are more evil than necessary.’ That is the fundamental question of what was going on in Boston,” Durham said in his lecture at the University of St. Joseph.

The Boston scandal represented the Bureau’s nightmare scenario. FBI special agent John Connolly Jr. had grown up in South Boston with mobsters James “Whitey” Bulger and Stephen “The Rifleman” Flemmi, as well as Whitey Bulger’s younger brother William Bulger, who was elected to the state house in 1960 and state senate in 1970.

Connolly had applied to the FBI and been turned down, but on August 1, 1968, John McCormack, then the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives and part of the Boston political machine, wrote a letter to his friend the FBI director, J. Edgar Hoover, touting Connolly’s attributes. Another letter followed in October. The day after the second letter, Hoover replied that Connolly would become a special agent, and Connolly was transferred to Boston in 1973. It is unusual for an agent to work in his old home city so early in his career, but Connolly had made a name for himself by tracking down and arresting Patriarca crime-family hitman “Cadillac” Frank Salemme in Manhattan the previous year — the same infamous gangster who would end up getting shot outside the International House of Pancakes decades later, whose assailants would be prosecuted by Durham.

“Connolly’s forte was not investigating cases, he wasn’t doing bank robberies or white-collar crime or the like,” Durham said in his speech at University of St. Joseph. “He had some interest in organized crime and recruiting informants. He makes his way back to Boston, and Connolly approaches [then state senator] Billy Bulger, who he appreciated for his political help, and asks what he can do for him to thank him for all the help he had provided. ‘Keep my brother out of trouble,’ he said, meaning Whitey Bulger.”

Around 1975, Connolly recruited Whitey Bulger and Stephen Flemmi to work as “top echelon informants” for the FBI, with the approval of Connolly’s supervisor, John Morris. They formed a devil’s alliance, with Bulger mostly providing information that led to arrests against the Italian mob, La Cosa Nostra, but left the Irish mob mostly intact. Meanwhile, Connolly leaked information that kept Bulger one step ahead of the Massachusetts State Police, the DEA, and any other law-enforcement effort against him. “The FBI had plenty of regulations and policies in place,” Durham said in his speech. “While the LCN was playing checkers, the Irish were playing chess. The number-one priority of the FBI at the time was taking down the LCN in the United States. [Bulger and his associates] had the keys to the kingdom, all the organized-crime information in Boston.”

The result was a pair of gangsters terrorizing Boston with an effective get-out-of-jail free card. “Steve Flemmi claimed that he had been told by the FBI supervisor, John Morris, that ‘you can commit any crime you want as long as you don’t clip anyone,’ meaning as long as you don’t kill anyone,” Durham said. “The indictment had extortion, illegal gambling, loansharking, use of violence and so forth, and his claim was that he and Bulger were authorized to do that.” The pair committed multiple murders anyway.

As the relationship continued, Connolly accepted cash and expensive cases of wine, and leaked information that led to the killing of three witnesses. He also warned Bulger about a federal indictment in 1994, prompting Bulger to go on the run. He was put on the FBI’s Most Wanted List, listed with the second-highest amount of reward money next to Osama bin Laden, and he remained at large for 16 years.

“As part of the law-enforcement tools that we have, [the use of informants is] a very powerful one, particularly when investigating organizations of violent individuals, like the Irish mafia up in Boston, or La Cosa Nostra,” Durham said. “It is true that oftentimes the only way you can attack those organizations is through the use of informants. But the damage that can be done when law enforcement or prosecutors misuse these tools is difficult to overstate.”

At the trial, Durham argued that Connolly “functioned as a member of a criminal enterprise . . . John Connolly knew what his obligations were, but he was on somebody else’s team.” Connolly was convicted of obstruction of justice and racketeering and sentenced to ten years, the maximum under federal guidelines, and later was charged with providing information to Flemmi and Bulger that led to the 1982 murder of a Miami businessman. Connolly received a separate 40-year prison sentence in Florida. Flemmi pleaded guilty to racketeering and ten murders and is serving a life sentence.

William Bulger went on to become the president of the Massachusetts state senate and president of the University of Massachusetts, and in the early 2000s he faced public criticism that he had not disclosed conversations with his fugitive brother to law enforcement. Asked whether he believed William Bulger really didn’t know where his brother was hiding, Durham said, “How much did he know? Probably a lot more than we can prove, but that’s speculation.”

The Boston FBI investigation and the Connolly prosecution proved Durham could step into a legal and political hurricane and follow the evidence, no matter how embarrassing it turned out to be to the people who had appointed him.

‘Not a Man Who Is Motivated or Influenced by a Political Agenda’

At some point, some particularly ill-informed critic of the administration may try to paint Durham as a right-wing hack or Republican loyalist. If so, Durham would be the rare kind of right-wing hack who helped send Connecticut’s three-term GOP governor, John Rowland, to prison. At the beginning of his third term, Rowland faced accusations that he sold a Washington, D.C., condominium at an inflated price and that state contractors had given him a sweetheart deal on improvements to his weekend home. By the end of the year, Rowland admitted that he had paid nothing for the work but pledged to pay the full price. Kevin O’Connor, the U.S. Attorney for Connecticut, had been a political ally of Rowland, and his wife had briefly worked for the governor. O’Connor recused himself, leaving the case in Durham’s hands.

The governor’s deputy chief of staff, Lawrence Alibozek, had developed a notorious reputation for bribery. The 22-page indictment against him listed bribes ranging from envelopes of cash, limousine rides, stays at posh hotels, and, in a detail right out of a novel, $10,000 in gold coins. Alibozek provided authorities with a roadmap of all the illicit deals in the Rowland administration and was spared prison, sentenced to a year of home confinement and five years of probation. His case was prosecuted by then–assistant U.S. Attorney Nora Dannehy, who has joined Durham in his current probe into the start of the Trump investigation. Durham supervised the negotiations of the resolution of the governor’s case, which led to Rowland’s guilty plea and subsequent term of imprisonment of one year and one day.

Durham is a registered Republican, but there’s no indication that he even blinked at the prospect of taking down the most prominent GOP official in the state. His longtime colleague Sullivan said, “I’m a little disheartened now when I start to see people attacking John in the press about his present assignment, because I truly know, in my heart, dealing with him for 30 years, that John Durham is not a man who is motivated or influenced by a political agenda.”

‘You’re the Only Things Standing between the CIA and an FBI Raid’

In 2008, then–attorney general Mukasey found himself with the challenge of investigating reports that the Central Intelligence Agency had destroyed videotapes of waterboarding sessions on captured detainees. Durham was one of a small handful of prosecutors Mukasey interviewed.

“The one story I heard about him at the time was that there had been a Hartford Courant article about him that mentioned him going to Mass three or four times a week, and that he had gotten a call from his mother wanting to know what about the other days,” Mukasey said. The former attorney general recalls that unlike the other prosecutors interviewed, Durham said he had no plans to keep the public informed about the progress of his work. Once again, his work in the courtroom would speak for itself.

Robert L. Deitz was senior counsel to then–CIA director Michael Hayden from 2006 until February 2009 and handled many negotiations with Durham during the investigation into the tapes. Deitz remembers Durham being “thoroughly professional and honest.” He jokes that despite being nicknamed “The Bull,” Durham was rarely disagreeable or difficult. “Oh, he’s a pussycat — very nice, very funny. Good sense of humor. If you were sarcastic, he understood you were being sarcastic. He’s such a straight shooter and a fair person.”

But whether Durham is more accurately compared to a bull or a pussycat, he could bare his teeth. “One day he came storming into my office at the agency, almost yelling — which was very uncharacteristic for him — and he said something like, ‘Bob, you’re the only thing standing between the CIA and an FBI raid!’ I was taken aback and surprised. He believed he was being jerked around by certain people at the agency, and it wasn’t an entirely wrong belief. I ended up talking to him at length and then taking care of the problem.”

Once he was investigating the destruction of the tapes, Durham didn’t discuss his work with Mukasey. Durham worked on his probe for three years in methodical and exhausting fashion. Unnamed sources told the Washington Post that Durham brought CIA lawyers, operatives, and others before a federal grand jury and probed for inconsistencies in their accounts; some witnesses testified four or five times. As the attorney general recalls it, there was no issue with cooperation from the CIA; then-director Michael Hayden “was well aware of the need to cooperate and that Durham would act with scrupulous fairness. His conclusion — that no prosecution was warranted in the circumstances — was never disputed by anyone.”

In August 2009, Attorney General Eric Holder expanded Durham’s mandate to see if any CIA officials who used “enhanced interrogation techniques” should be charged with crimes. By June 2011, Durham recommended opening full criminal investigations regarding the death of two individuals while in United States custody at overseas locations, and closing the remaining matters. A year later, the Department of Justice decided not to press charges in those cases, either. Holder declared that Durham had investigated every angle as thoroughly as humanly possible. “Mr. Durham and his team of agents and prosecutors have worked tirelessly to conduct extraordinarily thorough and complete preliminary reviews and investigations. I am grateful to his team and to him for their commitment to ensuring that the preliminary review and the subsequent investigations fully examined a broad universe of allegations from multiple sources. I continue to believe that our nation will be better for it.”

The lack of criticism for Durham’s decision in the CIA cases is a bit surprising, considering how routinely the agency was denounced by lawmakers, commentators, and activists, particularly at that time. The Department of Justice never elaborated on why Durham didn’t recommend charges in the destruction of the tapes, but one complication was that the burning of the 92 tapes on November 9, 2005, was authorized in a cable sent by Jose Rodriguez Jr., head of the agency’s directorate of operations. Another clue came in a Washington Post article, again quoting unidentified sources saying, “authorities found it difficult to pinpoint the motivation for destroying the tapes, and that it was difficult to prove criminal intent.”

In his speech at University of St. Joseph, Durham did not discuss his investigation of the tapes, but he did discuss the prosecutor’s calculus of when charges are warranted, which likely applied in this decision. “You are only authorized to bring a prosecution if you believe, based upon the evidence that you have, that you are likely to be able to prove a case not to the probable cause standard, which is all that is required to arrest somebody, but if you believe you can prosecute the case and prove that case beyond a reasonable doubt, and beyond that, that you would be able to sustain that conviction on appeal,” Durham said. “And if you can’t say, in all honesty, that you would be able to do that, then prosecution is not warranted. When on the nightly news, you’re watching what Bob Mueller is doing, and so forth, however that investigation turns out, whatever Mr. Mueller and his colleague conclude, if it’s not satisfactory to the public, it may very well be because Bob Mueller is an honorable man who applies those principles of law as he’s been taught and as he’s taught to others.”

“Durham was not just saying, ‘Do I have enough here that I could actually get a prosecution?’,” Deitz said. “But ‘Do I have enough here to justify — legally, morally, societally — this person’s conviction?’ That’s another reason why I admire him.”

‘They Ruined My Life’

As if all of this weren’t enough, Durham had a hand in coming close to cracking one of the biggest criminal mysteries in modern American history, the 1990 robbery of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston. In that notorious heist, paintings worth $500 million were stolen, including works by Vermeer and Manet, three Rembrandt paintings, and five sketches by Degas — the most expensive loot haul of any crime in American history.

In 2010, Elene Guarente, the widow of Boston mob associate Bobby Guarente, told the FBI that six years earlier, her mob-associated husband had handed over several of the museum’s stolen masterpieces to his best friend, Robert Gentile, in a seafood-restaurant parking lot in Portland, Maine. This put the septuagenarian Gentile on the radar of the FBI, and by 2013 he was imprisoned after convictions for weapons possession and illegal sale of prescription narcotics. Investigators dug through his property and underneath a shed in his backyard, looking for clues to the theft, and found what appeared to be a price list for each of the items. In 2015, Durham revealed in U.S. District Court that Gentile had been recorded negotiating the sale of stolen Gardner paintings with an undercover operative. Gentile denied all the allegations, arguing that if he’d had any of the paintings, he would have turned them in for the reward money. Prosecutors also revealed that Gentile had failed a polygraph test when he denied having advance knowledge of the Gardner heist, ever possessing a Gardner painting, or knowing the location of any of the stolen paintings. Alas, Gentile stuck to his denials and served out his sentence. The 82-year-old felon was released in March of this year, contending to the Hartford Courant’s Edmund Mahony that the FBI and prosecutors “ruined my life.”

‘I Don’t Worry about the Mafia. There Are Actual Rules Here.’

Durham established himself as the go-to guy when the country’s top law-enforcement and intelligence agencies need to investigate themselves diligently, thoroughly, and fairly. According to the New York Times, Durham spent part of 2017 investigating James A. Baker, the former top lawyer at the FBI, over a suspected leak of classified information. This leak was not related to the Russia investigation or the Steele dossier, according to Robert Litt, the former counsel to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, who was interviewed by Durham as part of the investigation. To avoid the perception that the FBI was investigating itself, Durham used U.S. Postal Service inspectors as his staff. Durham wrapped up the investigation in December of that year and concluded that no criminal charges were warranted.

Throughout all these high-profile cases, Durham remained an exceptionally private figure. Sullivan calls him “an avid Boston Red Sox fan” and a devout Catholic. While introducing Durham at the University of Saint Joseph speech, Boyle mocked Durham’s one discernible flaw, a questionable fashion sense: “John wears a suit to work every day — dark suit, light shirt, modest tie. You would think it wouldn’t be that hard,” Boyle said. “When you buy the suit, the jacket and pants come together. John seems to have an unfailing ability to mismatch the jacket and trousers. His wife puts tags on his clothes to match them, yet he still gets it wrong — he goes out the door, he doesn’t take the opportunity to look in the mirror, and then when standing in a courtroom, only then does he realize he wore the grey striped jacket and navy blue checked pants. I’ve wondered if jurors wonder, ‘Do you think that guy does that on purpose?’”

Asked whether he feels safe while prosecuting violent criminal originations, Durham replied, “I’m okay . . . personally, I don’t worry so much about like, the Mafia. I mean, there are some actual rules here. Speaking for myself, I’m not sure for a lot of other prosecutors, what you worry about is a person you don’t know about, somebody crazy. They’re not an obvious threat to you. One of my sons is a prosecutor, and he’s prosecuting these MS-13 people. That causes me some concern for him.”

In September, Durham and Attorney General Barr flew to Rome with inquiries for the Italian government about the beginning of the probe into Trump. Working with Barr has prompted some commentators on the left to suddenly reevaluate Durham’s previously impeccable reputation.

Matthew A. Miller, who was the director of the Obama Justice Department’s public-affairs office from 2009 to 2011, speculated to Andrea Mitchell that Durham had been reduced to a pawn: “I don’t think John Durham is in charge of this investigation.” Earlier this year, Miller wrote, “One thing about Durham: he moves incredibly slowly. I’d be shocked if he is done before November 2020, meaning Trump will be able to attack the FBI as being under a cloud throughout the campaign. All part of the plan.” (One of Miller’s duties at the department had been announcing that Durham would not press charges in the CIA-videotape investigation.)

Sherrilyn Ifill, the president of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, contended that Trump has somehow tainted or corrupted Durham: “Those who have expressed their faith in John Durham’s professionalism & long years of government service would do well to remember that many expressed confidence in [Attorney General] Barr and [former Deputy Attorney General Rod] Rosenstein for the same reasons. Working for Trump does not change you — it reveals you. We shall see. But be prepared.”

On Capitol Hill, Democrats such as Representative Jerrold Nadler (N.Y.), Representative Adam Schiff (Calif.), and Senator Mark Warner (Va.) haven’t criticized Durham by name but have made statements expressing fears that the Department of Justice has “become a vehicle for President Trump’s political revenge” or “a tool of political retribution.”

George Papadopoulos is the former low-level Trump-campaign foreign-policy adviser who became a major player in the FBI’s investigation into the campaign’s ties to Russia and pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators. For what it’s worth, he thinks Durham will eventually reveal bombshells. Papadopoulos wrote on Twitter. “For anyone who thinks that AG Barr and John Durham are on a fishing expedition around the world following ‘conspiracy theories,’ I have a bridge to sell you in the Sahara. Their findings will change world history.”

Barr may well know that Durham’s reputation will make any indictment that comes down the pike credible and not easily dismissed as a partisan exercise. On October 28, Barr did a rare televised interview and said of Durham, “He’s a 35-year veteran of the department. Great reputation for non-partisanship. He’s a by-the-book kind of guy. He’s thorough and fair. And I’m confident he’s going to get to the bottom of things.”

Mukasey notes that Durham chose Nora Dannehy, who was part of the team making the cases against Governor Rowland’s administration all those years ago, as his counsel in the current investigation of the Trump probe. Back in 2008, Mukasey chose her to investigate the controversial firing of seven U.S. Attorneys two years earlier. She concluded that the firings were inappropriately political but not criminal, and that there was insufficient evidence to charge anyone with lying to Congress or investigators. “She, too, went about her work quietly, and has a reputation similar to Durham’s for skill and an intense dedication to doing the job,” Mukasey said. “I can’t think of two people I would rather have in charge of this investigation.”

From all this, we can surmise a few things about Durham’s ongoing investigation into the launch of the probe of Donald Trump and his potential connections to Russia during the 2016 campaign. Durham will not speak to the press at all until he is done, and probably not even then. He and his team are extremely unlikely to leak. He is not afraid to reach conclusions that will disappoint or frustrate Attorney General Barr or President Trump. He will not be rushed; there is no guarantee that Durham will reach any prosecutorial decisions before the 2020 elections. And he will investigate so extensively and thoroughly that no reasonable observer will be able to argue that something important was missed. As Sullivan describes Durham, “He will be in constant pursuit of the truth and the facts and the evidence. John doesn’t take days off. He is methodical, but he is always working.”

If Durham chooses to bring charges against any official who launched the Trump probe, history suggests he is extremely likely to persuade a jury to convict the accused and sustain those convictions upon appeal. And if he does not bring charges, it is extremely unlikely that any other prosecutor could have succeeded; regardless of what the official did, the evidence would not be there to convict or sustain a conviction.

John Durham’s career is full of big, high-stakes, politically charged cases, but this one is the biggest, highest-stakes, and most politically charged of all. Luckily, it seems like his whole life has prepared him for this moment.

Mr. Barr , if confirmed by the Senate , would succeed acting attorney general Matthew Whitaker , who in earlier writings and television appearances had criticized the investigation into Russian election interference and any ties to Trump associates . Mr. Barr has also publicly criticized the investigation , meaning his confirmation hearings will likely be dominated by questions about how he would handle oversight of the probe .
“ He was my first choice since day one , ” Mr. Trump told reporters of Mr. Barr as he left Washington for Kansas City , Mo. , on Friday .
Mr. Barr , 68 years old , spent two years as attorney general under Republican President George H.W . Bush . One of the people who served under Mr. Barr during that time was Pat Cipollone , whom Mr. Trump named White House counsel in October .
Mr. Trump said that Mr. Barr , who has been counsel in the Washington office of the law firm Kirkland & Ellis , is “ respected by Republicans , respected by Democrats , ” adding that he hoped the nomination process “ will go very quickly . ”
Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn ( R. , Texas ) praised Mr. Barr as a “ very good choice ” earlier in the week and called him “ the kind of person who could get confirmed , ” but said of the confirmation process : “ It ’ s going to be challenging in any event . ”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ( D. , N.Y. ) on Friday said any attorney general nominated by Mr. Trump would face a “ steep hill to climb ” to confirmation . He called for Mr. Barr to commit to allowing the special counsel investigation to “ proceed unimpeded ” and to making public investigators ’ final report on the Russia probe “ immediately upon completion . ”
Jeff Sessions , whom Mr. Trump forced out a month ago , leading to Mr. Whitaker ’ s appointment , had recused himself from oversight of the special counsel ’ s probe , led by Robert Mueller . That recusal drew repeated broadsides by Mr. Trump , and Mr. Whitaker had faced calls to similarly recuse himself over his previous comments .
The special counsel ’ s probe , which Mr. Trump has repeatedly derided as a “ witch hunt , ” has led to guilty pleas or convictions involving several Trump 2016 campaign associates .
If confirmed as attorney general , Mr. Barr would likely espouse a similar crime-fighting agenda as the one he pushed the first time . As the nation ’ s top law-enforcement officer during the drug war in the early 1990s , Mr. Barr was known for tough policies on immigration and violent crime and for advocating more punitive criminal-justice laws—which critics blamed for soaring prison populations and other social ills .
He ordered the transfer of agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Drug Enforcement Administration to “ violent crime ” duty from other assignments and promised to add new immigration agents to “ combat illegal immigration and violent crime by criminal aliens , ” among other rollouts .
Mr . Sessions pursued a similar agenda , even as the rate of violent crime in the U.S. is down sharply since the early 1990s .
Mr. Barr is a more conventional choice than some other candidates the president considered , according to advisers and people close to the White House , and would likely face better confirmation odds in the Senate .

Besides investigating Russian election interference , Mr. Mueller is looking into whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice by , among other things , firing James Comey as FBI director in May 2017 , while the agency ’ s Russia probe was under way . Shortly after Mr. Comey ’ s firing , Mr. Barr wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post headlined : “ Trump made the right call on Comey . ”
Democrats are likely to seize on Mr. Barr ’ s criticism of the Russia probe . Still , Republicans will start the new Congress in January with a 53-47 majority in the Senate , so a conventional attorney general candidate like Mr. Barr will likely be approved and could be in office by February .
Mr. Barr has also called for “ more balance ” among the prosecutors working for Mr. Mueller , noting that some of them have made political contributions to Democrats . Mr. Mueller himself is a registered Republican . Mr. Barr also publicly supported Mr. Trump ’ s call last year for the Justice Department to investigate 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton , saying there was “ nothing inherently wrong ” with such a call . Presidents typically avoid public calls for investigations to avoid the appearance of interfering with matters of justice .
Mr. Barr “ will deal with requests in an entirely appropriate way . The president is more than entitled to express his opinion where he believes it important to do so , ” said George Terwilliger , who served as deputy attorney general under Mr. Barr and praised Mr. Barr ’ s nomination . “ The president may have more confidence in the decision making at the department than he seemed to have prior to this . ”
It wasn ’ t immediately clear what Mr. Barr ’ s nomination will mean for Mr. Whitaker , who associates said had been interested in the permanent position but knew he would face challenges being confirmed . Mr. Whitaker praised the nomination in remarks introducing the president Friday at the Kansas City event . “ Bill is supremely qualified , highly respected at the Department of Justice and will continue to support the women and men in blue . ”
Mr. Barr ’ s nomination also heightened doubts about Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein ’ s future in the department .

justice,CNN (Web News),0,http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/17/politics/special-counsel-robert-mueller/index.html?sr=fbcnni051717special-counsel-robert-mueller1014PMStoryLink&linkId=37706337,Special counsel appointed in Russia probe,2017-05-17,"Jeremy Diamond, Laura Jarrett","Washington ( CNN ) The Justice Department on Wednesday appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel to oversee the federal investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election , including potential collusion between President Donald Trump 's campaign associates and Russian officials .
Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller to the position in a letter obtained by CNN . Attorney General Jeff Sessions previously recused himself from any involvement in the Russia investigation due to his role as a prominent campaign adviser and surrogate .
As special counsel , Mueller is `` authorized to prosecute federal crimes arising from the investigation of these matters , '' according to the Justice Department order Rosenstein signed .
Mueller 's appointment aims to quell the wave of criticism that Trump and his administration have faced since Trump fired FBI Director James Comey last week in the middle of the FBI 's intensifying investigation into contacts between Trump campaign associates and Russian officials .
In a statement , Trump said an investigation will confirm that `` there was no collusion '' between his campaign and Russia .
`` As I have stated many times , a thorough investigation will confirm what we already know -- there was no collusion between my campaign and any foreign entity . I look forward to this matter concluding quickly . In the meantime , I will never stop fighting for the people and the issues that matter most to the future of our country . ''
In a brief statement , Mueller said , `` I accept this responsibility and will discharge it to the best of my ability . ''
News of the special counsel announcement was closely held . The White House received a heads-up less than an hour before the news broke at 6 p.m . ET . The rest of House leadership and rank-and-file members were in the dark , but a Justice Department official did reach out directly to Speaker Paul Ryan shortly before the announcement to let him know of the special counsel appointment , according to a GOP source .
Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D-California , a member of the Senate intelligence committee , said the appointment was needed .
`` I think it was the right thing to do and I believe they saw it as the right thing to do otherwise they 're going to have a fight and it 's not worth the fight , '' Feinstein said . `` There ( is ) mutual suspicion of one side and the other . This clears that up and has a person whose reputation is as good as it gets and he 'll be very good . ''
Calls for a special counsel or prosecutor were rising after The New York Times and then CNN reported on excerpts of a memo Comey wrote in February , in which Comey wrote that Trump asked him to drop the FBI investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn . Demands intensified from Democrats on Capitol Hill for the Justice Department to appoint a special counsel or prosecutor to oversee the case . Republicans on Tuesday night began to join those calls .
Trump was meeting with FBI director candidates when the White House was formally told that a special prosecutor had been named in Russia investigation . The White House counsel informed the president .
`` It 's still sinking in , '' one administration official said , describing an air of uncertainty in the West Wing . `` We were told about it . Not asked about it . ''
White House spokesman Sean Spicer on Monday dismissed the idea of a special prosecutor .
`` There 's , frankly , no need for a special prosecutor . We 've discussed this before , '' Spicer told reporters . `` You have two Senate committees that are looking into this , the FBI is conducting their own review . And -- and I think if you even look at what Acting Director ( Andrew ) McCabe said last week , he made it very clear that they have the resources that they need and that the work continues . ''
Beyond allegedly asking Comey to quit his investigation into Flynn -- who has been a central focus of the FBI 's investigation into contacts between Trump associates and Russia -- Trump said in an interview with NBC last week that he considered the `` Russia thing with Trump and Russia ' when he decided to fire Comey .
Trump has called the FBI investigation into Russia a `` hoax '' and `` taxpayer funded charade . ''
Thursday morning , he tweeted there was `` never a special ( counsel ) appointed '' to investigate `` all of the illegal acts that took place in the Clinton campaign and Obama administration . ''
He added , `` This is the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history ! ''
The appointment could be seen as a signal from Rosenstein . His independence was quickly praised as news of his appointment spread , with many recalling his famous refusal to bow to the demands of West Wing officials during the Bush administration .
When George W. Bush 's White House chief of staff and White House counsel sought to get an ailing Attorney General John Ashcroft to reauthorize a warrantless domestic surveillance program that the Justice Department had ruled illegal , Mueller and Comey rushed to the hospital to prevent the Bush officials from taking advantage of Ashcroft .
Comey made it there first , but as Mueller rushed to the hospital he called Ashcroft 's security detail and ordered them to prevent the top Bush officials from kicking Comey out of the room .

Mueller was appointed FBI Director by President George W. Bush in 2001 and served until 2013 , when Comey took over as head . He will resign from his private law firm WilmerHale to avoid any conflicts of interest , the Justice Department said .","Washington (CNN) The Justice Department on Wednesday appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel to oversee the federal investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, including potential collusion between President Donald Trump's campaign associates and Russian officials.

Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller to the position in a letter obtained by CNN . Attorney General Jeff Sessions previously recused himself from any involvement in the Russia investigation due to his role as a prominent campaign adviser and surrogate.

As special counsel, Mueller is ""authorized to prosecute federal crimes arising from the investigation of these matters,"" according to the Justice Department order Rosenstein signed.

Mueller's appointment aims to quell the wave of criticism that Trump and his administration have faced since Trump fired FBI Director James Comey last week in the middle of the FBI's intensifying investigation into contacts between Trump campaign associates and Russian officials.

In a statement, Trump said an investigation will confirm that ""there was no collusion"" between his campaign and Russia.

""As I have stated many times, a thorough investigation will confirm what we already know -- there was no collusion between my campaign and any foreign entity. I look forward to this matter concluding quickly. In the meantime, I will never stop fighting for the people and the issues that matter most to the future of our country.""

In a brief statement, Mueller said, ""I accept this responsibility and will discharge it to the best of my ability.""

News of the special counsel announcement was closely held. The White House received a heads-up less than an hour before the news broke at 6 p.m. ET. The rest of House leadership and rank-and-file members were in the dark, but a Justice Department official did reach out directly to Speaker Paul Ryan shortly before the announcement to let him know of the special counsel appointment, according to a GOP source.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, a member of the Senate intelligence committee, said the appointment was needed.

""I think it was the right thing to do and I believe they saw it as the right thing to do otherwise they're going to have a fight and it's not worth the fight,"" Feinstein said. ""There (is) mutual suspicion of one side and the other. This clears that up and has a person whose reputation is as good as it gets and he'll be very good.""

White House didn't want special counsel

Calls for a special counsel or prosecutor were rising after The New York Times and then CNN reported on excerpts of a memo Comey wrote in February, in which Comey wrote that Trump asked him to drop the FBI investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Demands intensified from Democrats on Capitol Hill for the Justice Department to appoint a special counsel or prosecutor to oversee the case. Republicans on Tuesday night began to join those calls.

Trump was meeting with FBI director candidates when the White House was formally told that a special prosecutor had been named in Russia investigation. The White House counsel informed the president.

""It's still sinking in,"" one administration official said, describing an air of uncertainty in the West Wing. ""We were told about it. Not asked about it.""

White House spokesman Sean Spicer on Monday dismissed the idea of a special prosecutor.

""There's, frankly, no need for a special prosecutor. We've discussed this before,"" Spicer told reporters. ""You have two Senate committees that are looking into this, the FBI is conducting their own review. And -- and I think if you even look at what Acting Director (Andrew) McCabe said last week, he made it very clear that they have the resources that they need and that the work continues.""

Beyond allegedly asking Comey to quit his investigation into Flynn -- who has been a central focus of the FBI's investigation into contacts between Trump associates and Russia -- Trump said in an interview with NBC last week that he considered the ""Russia thing with Trump and Russia' when he decided to fire Comey.

Trump has called the FBI investigation into Russia a ""hoax"" and ""taxpayer funded charade.""

Thursday morning, he tweeted there was ""never a special (counsel) appointed"" to investigate ""all of the illegal acts that took place in the Clinton campaign and Obama administration.""

He added , ""This is the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history!""

Rushed to Ashcroft's hospital room with Comey

The appointment could be seen as a signal from Rosenstein. His independence was quickly praised as news of his appointment spread, with many recalling his famous refusal to bow to the demands of West Wing officials during the Bush administration.

When George W. Bush's White House chief of staff and White House counsel sought to get an ailing Attorney General John Ashcroft to reauthorize a warrantless domestic surveillance program that the Justice Department had ruled illegal, Mueller and Comey rushed to the hospital to prevent the Bush officials from taking advantage of Ashcroft.

Comey made it there first, but as Mueller rushed to the hospital he called Ashcroft's security detail and ordered them to prevent the top Bush officials from kicking Comey out of the room.

Mueller later threatened to resign alongside Comey, who was then serving as deputy attorney general, over Bush administration officials' continued attempts to reauthorize the program. They ultimately did not resign as Bush sided with the Justice Department officials.

'Necessary' for 'full confidence' in investigation

Rosenstein said he believes a special counsel ""is necessary in order for the American people to have full confidence in the outcome.""

""In my capacity as acting attorney general, I determined that it is in the public interest for me to exercise my authority and appoint a Special Counsel to assume responsibility for this matter,"" Rosenstein said in a statement, adding that the decision is ""not a finding that crimes have been committed or that any prosecution is warranted.""

""What I have determined is that based upon the unique circumstances, the public interest requires me to place this investigation under the authority of a person who exercises a degree of independence from the normal chain of command,"" Rosenstein said.

Mueller was appointed FBI Director by President George W. Bush in 2001 and served until 2013, when Comey took over as head. He will resign from his private law firm WilmerHale to avoid any conflicts of interest, the Justice Department said.

First , that the U.S. Constitution vests plenary power in the President of the United States where foreign policy is concerned . Federal law , moreover , defines that power to include immigration . Section 212 ( f ) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 states :
Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States , he may by proclamation , and for such period as he shall deem necessary , suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants , or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate .
Therefore , if Donald Trump believes that people from Trinidad and Tobago , or Sri Lanka , or Iceland are bad news for the United States of America , regardless of the quality of his analysis in forming that belief , he is given power under federal law to ban those people from coming to the United States .
And if Donald Trump should draw from a list of countries compiled by his predecessor — it was the Obama administration which made a finding that Libya , Somalia , Sudan , Iraq , Iran , Syria and Yemen can not or will not facilitate the quality of vetting of immigrants and refugees satisfactory to a proper diminution of risk of terrorism — and issue a proclamation pursuant to that 1952 law suspending entry by people from those countries , then under the law the issue is closed until such time as Trump wishes to reopen it , or Congress wishes to change the 1952 law .
On either a temporary or even permanent basis so long as Trump or a successor who shares his beliefs sits in the White House .
Second , there is no constitutional right of a foreign national to enter the United States . Constitutional rights of foreign nationals commence upon their arrival in America , which is commonly interpreted as clearing customs and immigration bottlenecks at ports of entry .
Someone in Somalia who would like to relocate to Kearney , Nebraska , or Many , Louisiana , has no right under the U.S. Constitution or any other federal law to do so — such would be the exercise of a privilege allowed by the American government in the person of the president of the United States . That our government has been exceedingly generous in granting those privileges has no bearing on whether they have become rights .
And third , the immigration order put forth by the Trump administration , regardless of the reader ’ s judgment as to its wisdom or drafting , is not dissimilar to previous orders issued by Trump ’ s predecessors . Barack Obama barred entry for six months by Iraqis in 2011 ; Jimmy Carter banned Iranians during the hostage crisis . Indeed , each of Trump ’ s predecessors have issued bans of some kind on travel to or from various countries based on some assessment of risk .
Given those three inarguable items , the Ninth Circuit , or Ninth Circus as it ’ s frequently called given its atrocious record of being overturned , nevertheless upheld a restraining order issued by a federal judge in Seattle containing virtually no law on the essential basis that Trump ’ s order and rhetoric on immigration wasn ’ t suitably politically correct .
This is part and parcel of the kind of leftist politics which has infested the Ninth Circus in lieu of legal reasoning , and at some point a straw will break the camel ’ s back .
Perhaps there ’ s no time like the present for it , and perhaps Congress should step in and fix the problem . When appellate judges routinely ignore federal law as written and impose their politics in its place , we are no longer a nation of laws . And with so egregious an affront , perhaps an example should be made .
The federal courts are vested by Article 3 , Section 1 of the Constitution , which provides : “ The judicial Power of the United States , shall be vested in one supreme Court , and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. ” Accordingly , those inferior courts , including the Ninth Circuit , have been built through federal statutes .
And those statutes , and the courts they have produced , can be changed .
In 2004 , the Republican-led House passed a bill to break up the Ninth Circuit into three separate entities — one encompassing Hawaii and California , another to include Alaska , Oregon , and Washington state , and a third covering Arizona , Idaho , Montana and Nevada . Democrats in the Senate shot down the plan , which was advertised not as a response to the poor legal decision-making of the Ninth Circuit but rather due to the its vast geography . That effort came amid a decade-long advocacy by Newt Gingrich , who in 2002 began suggesting abolishing the Ninth Circuit after it ruled “ that ‘ one nation under God , ’ in the Pledge of Allegiance , was unconstitutional . ”
Gingrich ’ s idea was for Congress to subpoena the judges making what he called “ anti-American ” rulings and demanding they defend them under legal and constitutional justification — and if the answers weren ’ t satisfactory , to abolish the courts those judges inhabit .
He was laughed at for his ideas , and castigated by a pair of Bush-era attorneys general in late 2011 for such a radical view .

But after eight years of packing by a lawless president in Obama , that ruling shows Gingrich ’ s case is even stronger than it was when he was rebuked for it — and clearly , than when he began making it .
It ’ s time to start talking about whether the circus should leave town . Trump was elected because the American people , particularly those of us who don ’ t live on the West Coast and don ’ t care to be governed by its mandates against our will , are ready for change .

The deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, explicitly authorized special counsel Robert Mueller to investigate allegations that the former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort colluded with the Russian government, according to a court filing made late on Monday night.

Trump-Russia investigation: the key questions answered Read more

Mueller’s prosecutors included that detail in a memo defending the scope of their investigation, which so far has resulted in criminal charges against 19 people and three Russian companies.

Manafort, who led the Trump campaign for several months in 2016, is one of four aides charged in the Mueller investigation. Former national security adviser Michael Flynn, Manafort’s deputy, Rick Gates, and the foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos have entered plea deals.

Manafort has challenged Mueller’s authority and asked a judge to dismiss an indictment charging him with crimes including money laundering conspiracy and false statements.

He said Mueller, who was assigned to investigate potential coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign, overstepped his bounds by charging him for conduct that occurred years before the 2016 election.

Profile Who is Paul Manafort? Show Hide Paul Manafort served for five months as chairman of the Trump campaign, resigning in August 2016 after past payments he had received for work in the former Soviet bloc came to light. Investigators are believed to be scrutinizing Manafort's contacts with Russians during the campaign, including an offer by Manafort to Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska in July 2016 to provide ""private briefings"" on the US presidential race. Manafort, 68, was charged on 30 October with multiple federal felonies unconnected with his campaign duties. The charges included money laundering, tax fraud and conspiracy. Prosecutors accuse Manafort of using shell companies and tax havens to launder tens of millions of dollars in payments from Kremlin-backed political parties in Ukraine and other employers. Manafort pleaded not guilty to the charges. Manafort brought deep political experience to the Trump campaign. He had helped incumbent president Gerald Ford beat back a challenge for the nomination by Ronald Reagan at the 1976 Republican national convention and later built a lobbying business in Washington that specialised in unsavory clients around the world.

justice,Time Magazine,0,http://time.com/4781655/donald-trump-james-comey-michael-flynn-obstruction-of-justice/?xid=homepage,What Is Obstruction of Justice?,,Alana Abramson,"The term “ obstruction of justice ” has been swirling inside Washington D.C. and across cable television ever since President Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey last week . The talk only intensified after the New York Times cited a memo from Comey claiming Trump had asked him to shut down an investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn following his resignation .
“ Lots of chatter from Ds and Rs about the exact definition of “ obstruction of justice , ” Senator Chris Murphy tweeted Tuesday with a link to the Times report .
Yesterday , secrets to the Russians . Today , obstruction of justice ? When does this end ? ” Senator Sheldon Whitehouse tweeted .
But what exactly is obstruction of Justice and how does it relate to the headlines that have been coming out of the Beltway ?
Obstruction of Justice is essentially someone who intentionally intervenes or tampers with an ongoing investigation .
“ You can ’ t get in the way or do anything to impede an investigation that has already been launched and if you do you may suffer criminal penalties , ” said William C. Banks , a law professor and Director of the Institute for National Security and Counterterrorism at Syracuse University .
The federal code has 21 statutes outlining the different methods of obstruction of justice , including the use of murder or physical force to disrupt a testimony influencing a juror , and falsifying records . But one of the statutes , 18 U.S. Code § 1512 also includes a general provision , explaining that someone who “ otherwise obstructs , influences , or impedes any official proceeding , or attempts to do so , shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years , or both . ”
But the key to proving obstruction of justice , explains Robert Weisberg , a law professor at Stanford , is that the intervention has to be propelled by corrupt motives .
“ If it ’ s a threat , that makes it a crime . If it ’ s not a threat — but a request — it could still be a crime if the threat is motivated by a corrupt purpose , ” Weisberg said .
The punishment varies , and usually depends on what the person was convicted for , but the maximum is 20 years of imprisonment if fined under the federal statute of 18 U.S. Code § 1512 . In 1974 , articles of impeachment drafted against Richard Nixon accused him of obstructing justice after he refused to hand over his tape recordings to the FBI . Nixon resigned , but faced no charges because Gerald Ford pardoned him .
In 2007 , then Vice President Dick Cheney ’ s former Chief of Staff Scooter Libby , was convicted of obstruction of Justice — in addition to lying to a grand jury and FBI agents— regarding the federal investigation into the leak of the identity of Valerie Plame and received a 30 month prison sentence before President George W. Bush pardoned him that June .","The term “obstruction of justice” has been swirling inside Washington D.C. and across cable television ever since President Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey last week. The talk only intensified after the New York Times cited a memo from Comey claiming Trump had asked him to shut down an investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn following his resignation.

“Lots of chatter from Ds and Rs about the exact definition of “obstruction of justice,” Senator Chris Murphy tweeted Tuesday with a link to the Times report.

Yesterday, secrets to the Russians. Today, obstruction of justice? When does this end?” Senator Sheldon Whitehouse tweeted.

But what exactly is obstruction of Justice and how does it relate to the headlines that have been coming out of the Beltway?

Obstruction of Justice is essentially someone who intentionally intervenes or tampers with an ongoing investigation.

“You can’t get in the way or do anything to impede an investigation that has already been launched and if you do you may suffer criminal penalties,” said William C. Banks, a law professor and Director of the Institute for National Security and Counterterrorism at Syracuse University.

The federal code has 21 statutes outlining the different methods of obstruction of justice, including the use of murder or physical force to disrupt a testimony influencing a juror, and falsifying records. But one of the statutes, 18 U.S. Code § 1512 also includes a general provision, explaining that someone who “otherwise obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding, or attempts to do so, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.”

But the key to proving obstruction of justice, explains Robert Weisberg, a law professor at Stanford, is that the intervention has to be propelled by corrupt motives.

“If it’s a threat, that makes it a crime. If it’s not a threat — but a request — it could still be a crime if the threat is motivated by a corrupt purpose,” Weisberg said.

The punishment varies, and usually depends on what the person was convicted for, but the maximum is 20 years of imprisonment if fined under the federal statute of 18 U.S. Code § 1512. In 1974, articles of impeachment drafted against Richard Nixon accused him of obstructing justice after he refused to hand over his tape recordings to the FBI. Nixon resigned, but faced no charges because Gerald Ford pardoned him.

In 2007, then Vice President Dick Cheney’s former Chief of Staff Scooter Libby, was convicted of obstruction of Justice — in addition to lying to a grand jury and FBI agents— regarding the federal investigation into the leak of the identity of Valerie Plame and received a 30 month prison sentence before President George W. Bush pardoned him that June.

justice,Slate,0,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/06/george-floyd-police-protests-defund-conversations.html,"“In One Day, We Became the Worst Things in the Country”",2020-06-24,Christina Cauterucci,"This country is changing its mind about the police . Over the past few years , Americans have watched countless videos of police brutality against Black people . They ’ ve witnessed , or participated in , the formation of a massive social movement dedicated to the preservation and celebration of Black lives . And their perception of police forces has shifted : A Monmouth University survey conducted at the end of May found , for the first time in polling history , that a majority ( 57 percent ) of Americans and a plurality ( 49 percent ) of white people think police officers “ faced with a difficult or dangerous situation ” are “ more likely to use excessive force if the culprit is black. ” That ’ s an increase of 24 points among all Americans and 23 points among white people since Monmouth ’ s 2014 poll in the wake of NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo ’ s killing of Eric Garner .
Police officers have been watching those cameraphone videos too . They ’ ve witnessed , or participated in , the formation of a movement for “ blue lives ” in response to the movement affirming Black ones . More recently , they ’ ve been confronting Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin ’ s killing of George Floyd , the widespread protests against racism and police brutality , and the calls to defund or abolish police that have entered mainstream policy discourse as never before .
You ’ d be hard-pressed to find a cop who thinks his job ought to be bound for obsolescence . But law enforcement officials are processing this moment in American history in a wide variety of ways . Some officers are beating protesters and journalists in the streets . Some are beseeching their colleagues to listen to what the demonstrators have to say . Some are defending their profession on social media to strangers who reject the idea of a “ good cop. ” Some are considering a career change . Some police officers are drawing on their experiences as Black Americans to explain the protesters ’ grievances to their co-workers . Many remain convinced that , in most cases that aren ’ t as cut-and-dry as Floyd ’ s killing , civilians who end up injured or killed by police could have avoided their fate if they ’ d simply followed officers ’ orders .
Over the past two weeks , I spoke to seven current and former cops about the protests and the future of policing . ( They by no means constitute a representative cross-section of U.S. police officers ; compared with the national police demographic breakdown , those who eventually agreed to speak with me were disproportionately people of color , women , and/or LGBTQ . ) All strongly denounced Chauvin ’ s actions but disagreed on almost everything else : whether jurisdictions should divert funding from police departments toward other public services , whether law enforcement systems are peppered with a few bad apples or besieged by wholesale rot , whether claims of racism in police forces are substantiated or overblown . What follows are excerpts from our conversations , lightly edited for length and clarity .
I haven ’ t heard anyone in my department defend the killing of George Floyd . That ’ s how extreme the situation was with Floyd , between the fact that it was all recorded , to the total lack of humanity of the officers involved , to the eight to nine minutes of watching someone die , where you really can ’ t say anything in defense . And traditionally , as cops , we are defensive . But in this situation , everyone ’ s like , “ Yeah , that was jacked up for sure . ”
The protests have made us as law enforcement very uncomfortable—but it ’ s a necessary uncomfortable . My view on the protests is : We ’ ve seen the masses come out and say what they want done . And if it were a small group of people , you could kind of cast it off as “ oh , this is just one fringe group. ” But when you have police agreeing with it , and you have millions of people in the streets saying it needs to be changed , it ’ s kind of like , yeah , maybe we need to look in the mirror and change it .
`` The protests have made us as law enforcement very uncomfortable—but it ’ s a necessary uncomfortable . ''
I have been offended by calls for the abolishment of police . I don ’ t want that message to dilute the real message of defunding police departments , because defunding police departments makes sense . In most jurisdictions , public safety expenses exceed other expenditures by a large margin . Those funds should be allocated to improve education and social services , and to assist the mentally ill and homeless populations . And the whole bad apple–versus–good apple argument is just tired to me . It deflects from the real systemic problems that exist . Without widespread changes , the apples don ’ t matter .
My wife and I have conversations every day about the protests . I ’ m white , and she is Black . We agree with their messaging and calls for dramatic reform . We do , however , disagree on one front : property damage . From my wife ’ s point of view , she has seen peaceful protests many times before in this country , and sometimes they bring about incremental change . But in this instance , she believes more dramatic changes are needed , so more intense protests are needed . My view is that property damage will give opponents of police reform a crutch to fall onto . It will taint the overall message in the eyes of our leaders .
I ’ ve seen a lot of pendulum swings . Departments will go through phases where officers are on board with reform , but then if some officers get hurt , you might see officers saying , “ Hey , we need to get things back to the way they used to be. ” We go through times when police enforcement is proactive , then it becomes reactive . We become experts in deescalation , then we have an incident and we refocus on harsh enforcement of laws . It changes for each department depending on how morale is in the community and what ’ s viewed as acceptable .
When I first started out in law enforcement , in Florida , that police department and academy were very paramilitary . You ’ re really conditioned for that warrior type of mindset . You get trained from a SWAT perspective ; it ’ s totally different from patrol or community-oriented policing . In a class like that , we ’ re doing physical training , defensive tactics every day . They were emphasizing takedown maneuvers , how to use force . The training emphasizes having a plan and being firm in what you do , which is necessary . But you got ta know when to switch those hats . Because if you ’ re trained to be paranoid and always have a plan to kill somebody . … There ’ s a saying in police departments , “ I ’ d rather be tried by 12 than carried by six. ” That is a common phrase thrown around : “ Hey , I ’ d rather be in court charged with manslaughter than be killed in the line of duty. ” We all want to go home at the end of the day , but if you ’ re teaching people that mindset , it is devaluing the person on the other end .
In my department in Florida , it was mostly white police officers , and we were policing this very low-income African American neighborhood . You could see these officers that were not really from that sort of background— there would be communication issues . When you have that soldier mindset , you ’ re basically giving orders . There ’ s really no time for open dialogue to take place . It ’ s kind of , “ I ’ m telling you to do this . Do it. ” That kind of rubbed off on me early in my career . It really opened my eyes .
I ’ ve seen officers be abusive and escalate situations . One particular incident , an officer kicked a teenager in the teeth . He ended up getting terminated . One of my first nights out , with my training officer , we were patrolling one of the rougher neighborhoods in the city . We saw two black men with a pit bull walking on the wrong side of the street . In Florida , there ’ s a law that if you ’ re a pedestrian , you have to be walking opposite the flow of vehicle traffic . My training officer jumps out the car , so I jump out the car . The tone he used to simply confront them was—it shook me . We were stopping them for a pedestrian violation , but it almost seemed like we were at a robbery in progress .
I got so discouraged by what I was seeing and doing and not really liking the type of person I was becoming that I left policing entirely for a couple of years and managed retail for a while . It wasn ’ t until I met my wife and had a daughter and a stepdaughter when I felt I wanted to do something greater . I wanted to help make things better by getting back into policing .
Now , I ’ m about to get my master ’ s degree in criminal justice . In my classes , we ’ ve had to do deep dives on the Ferguson Police Department and CompStat up in New York and see how different methods of policing have certain repercussions , and why sticking to old methods is not going to work going forward . Look at Ferguson : The demographics of the police department were significantly different than the community it was policing . I ’ m trying to get into more supervision , to try to fix things going forward .
The past few weeks have been really difficult for me , because I see both sides of it . I see that police officers are good people . Me personally , I haven ’ t seen any bad police officers—but I ’ m not saying there aren ’ t any in our department . But I also know what it ’ s like to be Black and for someone to call the police on you for no reason .
When I was growing up in Oklahoma , it happened a couple of times . We ’ d take a shortcut to my mom ’ s house , or we ’ d be outside playing basketball , and somebody would call the police on us . The police would show up , and we would have no idea what was going on because we were just being kids . They just told us that somebody called because they thought we were up to no good .
Why did I want to be a police officer ? The simple answer is I thought there should be more Black police officers . Where I lived in Oklahoma , I don ’ t know if there were more than five [ Black officers ] in the department , in a city of close to 100,000 people . I would hear people talk about their interactions with the police , and I felt like the department really didn ’ t represent the population .
`` Why did I want to be a police officer ? The simple answer is I thought there should be more Black police officers . ''
We ’ ve talked about [ Floyd ’ s killing ] quite a bit . Everybody agrees that it was the wrong way to hold him down . Everybody knows that would be a policy violation here . Our supervisors brought it up , and our interim chief brought it up . He usually doesn ’ t comment on things that happen outside the city . But he agrees it was bad , it shouldn ’ t have happened , and George Floyd should be alive . I do think Chauvin should be charged with murder , and everyone I ’ ve talked to agrees .
My department is mostly white , but there are maybe six Black officers and a couple of Latinos . I do feel like some officers don ’ t understand why people are so angry right now . A lot of the police officers take an us-versus-them stance rather than good-versus-bad or right-versus-wrong , just because it ’ s a tightknit job where everybody becomes like family . They ’ re more apt to defend a police officer even when , to me , it ’ s clear police are in the wrong . But I think it ’ s more of an issue of a few bad apples . I don ’ t think the system of policing needs to change , just that officers need to hold people accountable when they see something like this .
Some of my co-workers have been coming to me and seeing how I ’ m doing with everything . I explain to them different things in my life , like how the police would get called on us for playing basketball in the street . None of them have had that happen to them before . They don ’ t know what it ’ s like to be Black . But a co-worker having that type of experience might open their eyes a little bit .
I didn ’ t know how the department would react to me agreeing with the protests , and I didn ’ t know how my family would react with me being a police officer . I ’ ve had family members who have had bad experiences with police . But I ’ ve talked to my family , and they ’ re still happy with me being a police officer . And that has helped the most , that my family ’ s OK with it . They know that I ’ m a good police officer ; they know that I ’ m a good person . They know that if anything like what Chauvin did is happening around me , then I ’ ll step in and make sure it doesn ’ t get to the point where somebody dies .
Ron * has worked at a police department in a major U.S. city for more than 20 years
I ’ ve not talked to a single officer who supported what happened in Minneapolis , yet every one of us is being painted with that broad brush . Everyone ’ s screaming about racism and racial inequality—but is that not what everybody is doing to law enforcement ? With racism , people get in power and use that power against another ethnicity . Now , [ activists ] have a voice because of what happened to Floyd , but they ’ re using that power against another group . That group happens to be law enforcement . Within law enforcement , you ’ re starting to hear about , “ Why are we being demonized and considered the bad guy ? ” COVID hit the U.S. and police were heroes . Then in one day , we became the worst things in the country . And what did we do ? It ’ s what one person did . Every profession has its bad apples . Teachers have gotten arrested for having sex with kids , but are people saying “ get rid of teachers ” ?
I taught a class on procedural justice for recruits and officers with a whole section on the African American history with police . I ’ m 100 percent understanding of it . I can have some empathy for that plight . What I don ’ t have empathy for is a failure of the movement to denounce … the riots , the property destruction . Is that what the movement wants to be known for ?
These days , society is asking police to do more things that they ’ re not equipped to do . Forty thousand people in the United States commit suicide every year , and what are we doing about it ? The answer is , equip a cop to deescalate somebody who ’ s ready to jump off a bridge ? The cops have now become kind of a catchall for everything . Can every cop deescalate a mental health patient ? No , even if they get training .
In my career , have I done some things that maybe I wasn ’ t so proud of ? I can ’ t lie to you . But I also have to tell you there are people out there who have no problem trying to kill me . And how do I discern the difference ? It ’ s all about the person ’ s behavior . A lot of people want to make cops out to be racist . But when they get in those tense situations , cops are reacting to behavior . There have been some people who have come out and said , “ Hey , if you just follow the directions of a cop , you should be OK. ” That ’ s not a bad piece of advice .
[ George Floyd ’ s killing ] is more of a clear case versus past examples where officers are struggling with somebody . It wasn ’ t a highly emotionally charged event . Chauvin was clearly calm , and it ’ s not like he was wrestling with the guy at that particular moment .
`` In my career , have I done some things that maybe I wasn ’ t so proud of ? I can ’ t lie to you . ''
I agree that Black people might be perceived as more aggressive for doing the same thing as a white person . The research shows even African American police officers see African American men as more aggressive . Where does implicit bias come from ? Stereotypes , interactions . I ’ d advocate for this : Every cop who works in what they call a “ fast district ” or a “ minority district , ” they should be periodically rotated out to another neighborhood with a similar racial makeup but economically different , with less crime , so they can get some positive imagery of a particular minority group to help replace what they ’ ve seen . Because how do you counteract implicit bias ? You replace the stereotype you have about a particular group of people with positive ones . But if you have an officer who sits in a high-violence neighborhood and the people who live there all happen to be African American or Latino , what ’ s naturally gon na happen ? What ’ s his thinking gon na be ?
Some of my friends have lost friends over this issue . It ’ s getting to that point . I ’ ve had to have lengthy discussions with my college-age daughter . She was asked to go protest by her friends . Her comment , and I got ta give her 100 percent props , was , “ I ’ m against racial injustice and the things that have happened , but why do we have to protest against cops ? ” If I didn ’ t believe in good changes coming out of this , I ’ d probably be a very depressed person .
Me and my co-workers , we ’ re all on the same page about George Floyd . What bothers us the most is that the three sat there and didn ’ t do anything to stop Chauvin . So a lot of the cops were disgusted , and mad because that makes us all look bad . It makes it so people don ’ t trust the police . I can ’ t say I necessarily blame them .
Being a cop right now—it ’ s not good . When I try to defend cops on Twitter , where I like to talk to people about queer TV shows , no one responds . All them are saying , “ Fuck the police , defund the police. ” And I ’ m like : “ Hey , I ’ m here , I ’ m queer , too , and I ’ m a cop . And I ’ m saying , some of the stuff those cops are doing , it ’ s not OK. It ’ s not all of us . ”
In real life , the “ fuck the police ” stuff gets to you . It ’ s really entertaining when people say that and then five minutes later they ask for help . I ’ ve seen that a few times . They ’ ll be like “ Fuck the police ! ” and within the next day I ’ ll get a call . I ’ ll be like , oh , fuck me , right ? We ’ re not appreciated until we ’ re needed .
I understand Black lives matter . Everyone agrees with that . That ’ s not an issue for me , and it shouldn ’ t be an issue for anybody else . But when you commit arson and start stealing stuff that doesn ’ t belong to you , that ’ s when it becomes a problem . We understand it ’ s not all of you , but you wan na sit there—I ’ m sure you ’ ve seen memes that people have sent around about 1,000 good cops , but if you have 10 bad cops , you have 1,100 bad cops because we ’ re not holding one another accountable . The same could be flipped , with 1,000 protesters and 10 agitators .
Some of the stuff I ’ ve seen cops do at these protests is unnecessary . Like , I understand this lady is sitting in front of you and you need her to move . You don ’ t have to kick her in the face , though . When it comes to enacting reforms [ about the use of force by police ] , most of them have exceptions . So , for example , most departments already restrict shooting at moving vehicles . But if you are trying to run me over with a car , which could kill me , I ’ m authorized to use deadly force to protect myself or the life of another . In Virginia , we can use deadly force if we have reason to believe the person fleeing has just committed a felony and poses an imminent threat to us or another person . And if I ’ m authorized to use deadly force , which means it ’ s a life-or-death situation where I ’ m in fear for my life or the life of another , I can and will do whatever I have to do to stop that threat . That means I can shoot , stab , beat , strangle , choke—nothing is off limits at that point .
My last 17 years , I ’ ve seen a big change from when I first started in the attitudes and the culture of policing . It ’ s been good and bad . Now we ’ re definitely under the microscope more than we used to be . I wish police departments were a little more transparent in the sense of how we police our own . There ’ s always this theory that police take care of themselves and things get swept under the rug . In my years in this field , I ’ ve seen a lot of officers be terminated , a lot of officers be suspended for different violations and breaking the code of ethics . And I think if the public would see that , and we would be more vocal about that , that would kind of help show our community , “ Look , we don ’ t tolerate this . ”
When we see [ police officers beating people ] on the news , we sit there and just chat in the office like , “ Man , really , again ? What were you thinking ? ” When we hear about these cops who are slamming people on the ground who are handcuffed and their faces bounce off the concrete—I would vouch for all the guys in my office , none of us would treat somebody like that .
`` I ’ ve had to pray . I ’ ve had to seek guidance from my pastor . ''
I grew up in an impoverished neighborhood . My dad was an immigrant . There were six of us living in that home with one bathroom . I ’ m where I ’ m at because of hard work . And then I ’ m now told , “ You won ’ t understand because you ’ re not Black. ” But I ’ m being told this by Black friends who grew up in wealthy neighborhoods , friends who grew up with parents being very successful . We can go back and look at 100 years ago , and yes , if I was living in that time frame , I would be right there marching . But I ’ ve seen a Black president .
I ’ ve been struggling . Friends whom I know , whom I ’ ve grown up with , say I ’ m a racist because of the person I voted for , although I don ’ t agree with everything Trump says . I ’ ve had to pray . I ’ ve had to seek guidance from my pastor . After 17 years , I ’ m on the verge of just saying “ I ’ m done ” and turning it in . I never thought I would—I thought I ’ d be a 30-year cop . But I ’ m looking for other career choices . I ’ ve been very vocal with my kids : I don ’ t want them in this field . I want them to be something else . Because it ’ s only gon na get worse . They ’ re voting to [ disband ] the Minneapolis Police Department . I don ’ t want my boys to do this .
Katie Miller , 30 , former officer at the Metropolitan Police Department in the District of Columbia
I ’ ve noticed a lot of my former colleagues with D.C. ’ s police department outright condemning Chauvin ’ s actions , which isn ’ t something that I had seen in the past , to be honest . Usually there ’ s a little hesitation about “ Let ’ s wait and see where the investigation goes. ” But when it came to seeing that video , I knew , and my former colleagues knew , that what they were seeing was enough to condemn him morally and obviously that criminal charges would be forthcoming . That vocalness among police officers is something I haven ’ t witnessed in the past that I find to be really encouraging .
When I was a cop , we ’ d have conversations about these shootings , focused on understanding the circumstances around them and what went wrong . There was some room for disagreement about whether an officer handled it in the correct way . Tamir Rice ’ s killing is a good example of that . There was a tactical mistake , and that was driving that car right up next to a person whom you didn ’ t know anything about . Why would you do that and basically plop your partner out right in front without any cover ? In front of a person who allegedly has a weapon ? It ’ s not smart police work . But there was another layer to that conversation that some of the Black officers brought up , which is : Would there have been the benefit of the doubt given to Rice if he were a white boy as opposed to a young Black boy ?
`` I think there are a number of issues where the old-school police officers are not seeing eye to eye with the rookies and the younger generation . ''
Some violence stems from the fact that there ’ s a lack of manpower in a police department . If you don ’ t have enough people working your shift , these 911 calls don ’ t stop . They just keep building up . If you ’ re working an evening or weekend shift , you ’ re working those eight or 10 hours straight , responding from one call to the next call . There ’ s a sort of keep-it-moving mentality . I think that bumps up against a lot of the tactics advocates are calling for , such as deescalation . Deescalation takes time . That means you need to slow it down . When you get to a scene and someone ’ s upset , instead of having to worry about the three or four calls pending after the one you just responded to , you need to be able to stay and have the space and lack of pressure to say , “ I ’ m gon na take my time and talk to this person and really figure out what the problem is. ” A department that ’ s adequately staffed can afford to have a softer approach to these issues . So in order for calls for defunding police or reducing police budgets to be in the best interest of communities , I think those calls need to be accompanied by a radical rethinking of what we ’ re asking police to do .
I think the cops policing the protests are beat down , for sure . A lot of them haven ’ t had days off for a really long time since the protests began . So I think there ’ s a sense of exhaustion . But I think a lot of social movements in history would prove that these kinds of protests are necessary to change America ’ s relationship to policing .
I also think there are a number of issues where the old-school police officers are not seeing eye to eye with the rookies and the younger generation . When I was a cop , I had a friend who was new on the police force . He responded to a call , and somebody came up to him and pushed a finger into his chest , as a way to disrespect him . And my friend ’ s response was not to do anything . And the next day in roll call , which is where everyone gets dogged out for anything that happened the night before , somebody stood up and said something along the lines of , “ Yeah , you ’ re a police officer , I get it . But you ’ re a man first , and you don ’ t let another man touch you like that. ” That was a total generational divide . Like , there ’ s something about this man ’ s work that ’ s caught up in his gender identity . It represents a rather inflexible form of policing , I guess , to put it nicely .
When you walk into a roll call room , it ’ s all arranged according to seniority . So all the younger officers have to sit at the front , and the people who ’ ve been on for two decades , they get to kind of do what they want in the back . They ’ re smoking and joking , and the people up front are diligently taking notes in their uniform . Their shoes are still shined and everything . A lot of the older officers were working when crack hit D.C. really hard . They always bring up the tagline of D.C. having been the “ murder capital. ” Like , if they ’ re training somebody , they ’ ll say , “ All right , you need to listen to me because I worked here when D.C. was the murder capital of the United States. ” There ’ s a sense of pride associated with that . And a sense that some of the rest of us might be used to a safer way of life , to being pampered or babied .
With my family members , I think there was this idea that you need to “ back the blue , ” especially when I was actually on the police force . They want to support me , so they naturally think this is the side that I ’ m on , so this is whom you root for . I ’ ve worked hard with my friends and family to show them that this isn ’ t as binary an issue as that . I ’ ve been having conversations with family members about the protests , and especially about the nonpeaceful protesters . I can talk candidly about why that ’ s not something that upsets me terribly . It ’ s unfortunate , but also in the grand scheme of things it ’ s understandable—and effective , to be honest . I think my family can more readily hear that message from me , since I used to be a cop .
The bigger picture to me is the thoughtfulness this is really spurring among police departments and officers , because the situation unfolded as it did and there was space to ask why this happened to George Floyd , to ask why Chauvin felt he could treat this man this way , that undoubtedly keeps pointing back to racism . Police officers often do make split-second decisions , where if there ’ s any bit of implicit bias , it ’ s going to come out . There ’ s a difference between having implicit bias training and a police officer looking inside themselves and seeing that there ’ s a part of them that ’ s racist too , regardless of the training they have or how they think of themselves . That seems to be a more abstract but even more important transformation that I think is happening , I hope is happening .
I ’ m more optimistic about the future of this country than I have been in the past 3½ years . Because up until this point , there was so much apathy , so much frog-boiling going on . It was one outrage after another , people getting tired and numb to it . But [ George Floyd ’ s killing ] shocked the conscience so much that it woke people out of that torpor .
`` We have to look at police culture , because that wall of silence gets us into an incredible amount of trouble . ''
I ’ m a liberal , transgender police officer . You aren ’ t going to find many of us . We know that public safety in general tends to attract people with more conservative ideologies . And part of being a conservative is you ’ re not so comfortable with change and new things . So if you ’ re taught police are always right , then all of a sudden when I say , “ You know , I don ’ t really think we should be shooting Black kids in the back as they ’ re running away from us , ” all of a sudden , it becomes a threat . It becomes , “ Wait a second , are you really one of us ? ” It doesn ’ t mean that officers feel like “ Yeah , we should be able to shoot Black kids in the back and get away with it , ” but it ’ s more like “ Yeah , that was bad , but look at all these contributing factors . ”
I once got into an argument with an officer over nasal Narcan . He was a “ let these scumbags die ” kind of person . But part of the training [ for Narcan , an emergency treatment for opioid overdose ] is : We humanize people . One of the speakers in the training was a mother with three kids , and two of them had died from opioid overdoses . The third one was constantly also having problems overdosing . She pleaded with officers : “ Please , this is my last baby . Don ’ t let my baby die. ” And that was what changed that officer ’ s opinion . He came up to me later and said : “ I was wrong . That really hit home . I ’ m a parent . I can ’ t imagine losing my child . ”
I think the protests could have a similar effect . But it ’ s a bit of a razor and people can fall on one side of it or the other . Because if you look at some of the crap that went on in Minneapolis and St. Paul—police are using force to punish protestors . I think that right now , they have a siege mentality , and they are just hunkered down and angry and scared and they ’ re lashing out .
We also have to look at police culture , because that wall of silence gets us into an incredible amount of trouble . It allows us to justify behavior that we wouldn ’ t permit for anybody else . Those officers in Buffalo [ who assaulted 75-year-old activist Martin Gugino ] —when another officer tried to intervene and was pulled back , what message does that send ? That message says , “ We live , they die. ” How do you say that you ’ re the good guy and yet you cheer on somebody who committed an unnecessary act of violence that resulted in a serious physical injury ? That ’ s a police culture problem . The organizational structures of police agencies are very narrow pyramids . You can train out of a police culture problem , but it comes from the top .","This country is changing its mind about the police. Over the past few years, Americans have watched countless videos of police brutality against Black people. They’ve witnessed, or participated in, the formation of a massive social movement dedicated to the preservation and celebration of Black lives. And their perception of police forces has shifted: A Monmouth University survey conducted at the end of May found, for the first time in polling history, that a majority (57 percent) of Americans and a plurality (49 percent) of white people think police officers “faced with a difficult or dangerous situation” are “more likely to use excessive force if the culprit is black.” That’s an increase of 24 points among all Americans and 23 points among white people since Monmouth’s 2014 poll in the wake of NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo’s killing of Eric Garner.

Police officers have been watching those cameraphone videos too. They’ve witnessed, or participated in, the formation of a movement for “blue lives” in response to the movement affirming Black ones. More recently, they’ve been confronting Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin’s killing of George Floyd, the widespread protests against racism and police brutality, and the calls to defund or abolish police that have entered mainstream policy discourse as never before.

You’d be hard-pressed to find a cop who thinks his job ought to be bound for obsolescence. But law enforcement officials are processing this moment in American history in a wide variety of ways. Some officers are beating protesters and journalists in the streets. Some are beseeching their colleagues to listen to what the demonstrators have to say. Some are defending their profession on social media to strangers who reject the idea of a “good cop.” Some are considering a career change. Some police officers are drawing on their experiences as Black Americans to explain the protesters’ grievances to their co-workers. Many remain convinced that, in most cases that aren’t as cut-and-dry as Floyd’s killing, civilians who end up injured or killed by police could have avoided their fate if they’d simply followed officers’ orders.

Over the past two weeks, I spoke to seven current and former cops about the protests and the future of policing. (They by no means constitute a representative cross-section of U.S. police officers; compared with the national police demographic breakdown, those who eventually agreed to speak with me were disproportionately people of color, women, and/or LGBTQ.) All strongly denounced Chauvin’s actions but disagreed on almost everything else: whether jurisdictions should divert funding from police departments toward other public services, whether law enforcement systems are peppered with a few bad apples or besieged by wholesale rot, whether claims of racism in police forces are substantiated or overblown. What follows are excerpts from our conversations, lightly edited for length and clarity.

Jacob, 32, police officer in Georgia

I haven’t heard anyone in my department defend the killing of George Floyd. That’s how extreme the situation was with Floyd, between the fact that it was all recorded, to the total lack of humanity of the officers involved, to the eight to nine minutes of watching someone die, where you really can’t say anything in defense. And traditionally, as cops, we are defensive. But in this situation, everyone’s like, “Yeah, that was jacked up for sure.”

The protests have made us as law enforcement very uncomfortable—but it’s a necessary uncomfortable. My view on the protests is: We’ve seen the masses come out and say what they want done. And if it were a small group of people, you could kind of cast it off as “oh, this is just one fringe group.” But when you have police agreeing with it, and you have millions of people in the streets saying it needs to be changed, it’s kind of like, yeah, maybe we need to look in the mirror and change it.

""The protests have made us as law enforcement very uncomfortable—but it’s a necessary uncomfortable.""

I have been offended by calls for the abolishment of police. I don’t want that message to dilute the real message of defunding police departments, because defunding police departments makes sense. In most jurisdictions, public safety expenses exceed other expenditures by a large margin. Those funds should be allocated to improve education and social services, and to assist the mentally ill and homeless populations. And the whole bad apple–versus–good apple argument is just tired to me. It deflects from the real systemic problems that exist. Without widespread changes, the apples don’t matter.

My wife and I have conversations every day about the protests. I’m white, and she is Black. We agree with their messaging and calls for dramatic reform. We do, however, disagree on one front: property damage. From my wife’s point of view, she has seen peaceful protests many times before in this country, and sometimes they bring about incremental change. But in this instance, she believes more dramatic changes are needed, so more intense protests are needed. My view is that property damage will give opponents of police reform a crutch to fall onto. It will taint the overall message in the eyes of our leaders.

I’ve seen a lot of pendulum swings. Departments will go through phases where officers are on board with reform, but then if some officers get hurt, you might see officers saying, “Hey, we need to get things back to the way they used to be.” We go through times when police enforcement is proactive, then it becomes reactive. We become experts in deescalation, then we have an incident and we refocus on harsh enforcement of laws. It changes for each department depending on how morale is in the community and what’s viewed as acceptable.

When I first started out in law enforcement, in Florida, that police department and academy were very paramilitary. You’re really conditioned for that warrior type of mindset. You get trained from a SWAT perspective; it’s totally different from patrol or community-oriented policing. In a class like that, we’re doing physical training, defensive tactics every day. They were emphasizing takedown maneuvers, how to use force. The training emphasizes having a plan and being firm in what you do, which is necessary. But you gotta know when to switch those hats. Because if you’re trained to be paranoid and always have a plan to kill somebody. … There’s a saying in police departments, “I’d rather be tried by 12 than carried by six.” That is a common phrase thrown around: “Hey, I’d rather be in court charged with manslaughter than be killed in the line of duty.” We all want to go home at the end of the day, but if you’re teaching people that mindset, it is devaluing the person on the other end.

In my department in Florida, it was mostly white police officers, and we were policing this very low-income African American neighborhood. You could see these officers that were not really from that sort of background— there would be communication issues. When you have that soldier mindset, you’re basically giving orders. There’s really no time for open dialogue to take place. It’s kind of, “I’m telling you to do this. Do it.” That kind of rubbed off on me early in my career. It really opened my eyes.

I’ve seen officers be abusive and escalate situations. One particular incident, an officer kicked a teenager in the teeth. He ended up getting terminated. One of my first nights out, with my training officer, we were patrolling one of the rougher neighborhoods in the city. We saw two black men with a pit bull walking on the wrong side of the street. In Florida, there’s a law that if you’re a pedestrian, you have to be walking opposite the flow of vehicle traffic. My training officer jumps out the car, so I jump out the car. The tone he used to simply confront them was—it shook me. We were stopping them for a pedestrian violation, but it almost seemed like we were at a robbery in progress.

I got so discouraged by what I was seeing and doing and not really liking the type of person I was becoming that I left policing entirely for a couple of years and managed retail for a while. It wasn’t until I met my wife and had a daughter and a stepdaughter when I felt I wanted to do something greater. I wanted to help make things better by getting back into policing.

Now, I’m about to get my master’s degree in criminal justice. In my classes, we’ve had to do deep dives on the Ferguson Police Department and CompStat up in New York and see how different methods of policing have certain repercussions, and why sticking to old methods is not going to work going forward. Look at Ferguson: The demographics of the police department were significantly different than the community it was policing. I’m trying to get into more supervision, to try to fix things going forward.

Maurice Henry, 34, patrol officer, Kansas

The past few weeks have been really difficult for me, because I see both sides of it. I see that police officers are good people. Me personally, I haven’t seen any bad police officers—but I’m not saying there aren’t any in our department. But I also know what it’s like to be Black and for someone to call the police on you for no reason.

When I was growing up in Oklahoma, it happened a couple of times. We’d take a shortcut to my mom’s house, or we’d be outside playing basketball, and somebody would call the police on us. The police would show up, and we would have no idea what was going on because we were just being kids. They just told us that somebody called because they thought we were up to no good.

Why did I want to be a police officer? The simple answer is I thought there should be more Black police officers. Where I lived in Oklahoma, I don’t know if there were more than five [Black officers] in the department, in a city of close to 100,000 people. I would hear people talk about their interactions with the police, and I felt like the department really didn’t represent the population.

""Why did I want to be a police officer? The simple answer is I thought there should be more Black police officers.""

We’ve talked about [Floyd’s killing] quite a bit. Everybody agrees that it was the wrong way to hold him down. Everybody knows that would be a policy violation here. Our supervisors brought it up, and our interim chief brought it up. He usually doesn’t comment on things that happen outside the city. But he agrees it was bad, it shouldn’t have happened, and George Floyd should be alive. I do think Chauvin should be charged with murder, and everyone I’ve talked to agrees.

My department is mostly white, but there are maybe six Black officers and a couple of Latinos. I do feel like some officers don’t understand why people are so angry right now. A lot of the police officers take an us-versus-them stance rather than good-versus-bad or right-versus-wrong, just because it’s a tightknit job where everybody becomes like family. They’re more apt to defend a police officer even when, to me, it’s clear police are in the wrong. But I think it’s more of an issue of a few bad apples. I don’t think the system of policing needs to change, just that officers need to hold people accountable when they see something like this.

Some of my co-workers have been coming to me and seeing how I’m doing with everything. I explain to them different things in my life, like how the police would get called on us for playing basketball in the street. None of them have had that happen to them before. They don’t know what it’s like to be Black. But a co-worker having that type of experience might open their eyes a little bit.

I didn’t know how the department would react to me agreeing with the protests, and I didn’t know how my family would react with me being a police officer. I’ve had family members who have had bad experiences with police. But I’ve talked to my family, and they’re still happy with me being a police officer. And that has helped the most, that my family’s OK with it. They know that I’m a good police officer; they know that I’m a good person. They know that if anything like what Chauvin did is happening around me, then I’ll step in and make sure it doesn’t get to the point where somebody dies.

Ron* has worked at a police department in a major U.S. city for more than 20 years

I’ve not talked to a single officer who supported what happened in Minneapolis, yet every one of us is being painted with that broad brush. Everyone’s screaming about racism and racial inequality—but is that not what everybody is doing to law enforcement? With racism, people get in power and use that power against another ethnicity. Now, [activists] have a voice because of what happened to Floyd, but they’re using that power against another group. That group happens to be law enforcement. Within law enforcement, you’re starting to hear about, “Why are we being demonized and considered the bad guy?” COVID hit the U.S. and police were heroes. Then in one day, we became the worst things in the country. And what did we do? It’s what one person did. Every profession has its bad apples. Teachers have gotten arrested for having sex with kids, but are people saying “get rid of teachers”?

I taught a class on procedural justice for recruits and officers with a whole section on the African American history with police. I’m 100 percent understanding of it. I can have some empathy for that plight. What I don’t have empathy for is a failure of the movement to denounce … the riots, the property destruction. Is that what the movement wants to be known for?

These days, society is asking police to do more things that they’re not equipped to do. Forty thousand people in the United States commit suicide every year, and what are we doing about it? The answer is, equip a cop to deescalate somebody who’s ready to jump off a bridge? The cops have now become kind of a catchall for everything. Can every cop deescalate a mental health patient? No, even if they get training.

In my career, have I done some things that maybe I wasn’t so proud of? I can’t lie to you. But I also have to tell you there are people out there who have no problem trying to kill me. And how do I discern the difference? It’s all about the person’s behavior. A lot of people want to make cops out to be racist. But when they get in those tense situations, cops are reacting to behavior. There have been some people who have come out and said, “Hey, if you just follow the directions of a cop, you should be OK.” That’s not a bad piece of advice.

[George Floyd’s killing] is more of a clear case versus past examples where officers are struggling with somebody. It wasn’t a highly emotionally charged event. Chauvin was clearly calm, and it’s not like he was wrestling with the guy at that particular moment.

""In my career, have I done some things that maybe I wasn’t so proud of? I can’t lie to you.""

I agree that Black people might be perceived as more aggressive for doing the same thing as a white person. The research shows even African American police officers see African American men as more aggressive. Where does implicit bias come from? Stereotypes, interactions. I’d advocate for this: Every cop who works in what they call a “fast district” or a “minority district,” they should be periodically rotated out to another neighborhood with a similar racial makeup but economically different, with less crime, so they can get some positive imagery of a particular minority group to help replace what they’ve seen. Because how do you counteract implicit bias? You replace the stereotype you have about a particular group of people with positive ones. But if you have an officer who sits in a high-violence neighborhood and the people who live there all happen to be African American or Latino, what’s naturally gonna happen? What’s his thinking gonna be?

Some of my friends have lost friends over this issue. It’s getting to that point. I’ve had to have lengthy discussions with my college-age daughter. She was asked to go protest by her friends. Her comment, and I gotta give her 100 percent props, was, “I’m against racial injustice and the things that have happened, but why do we have to protest against cops?” If I didn’t believe in good changes coming out of this, I’d probably be a very depressed person.

Natalie*, early 30s, a cop in Virginia

Me and my co-workers, we’re all on the same page about George Floyd. What bothers us the most is that the three sat there and didn’t do anything to stop Chauvin. So a lot of the cops were disgusted, and mad because that makes us all look bad. It makes it so people don’t trust the police. I can’t say I necessarily blame them.

Being a cop right now—it’s not good. When I try to defend cops on Twitter, where I like to talk to people about queer TV shows, no one responds. All them are saying, “Fuck the police, defund the police.” And I’m like: “Hey, I’m here, I’m queer, too, and I’m a cop. And I’m saying, some of the stuff those cops are doing, it’s not OK. It’s not all of us.”

In real life, the “fuck the police” stuff gets to you. It’s really entertaining when people say that and then five minutes later they ask for help. I’ve seen that a few times. They’ll be like “Fuck the police!” and within the next day I’ll get a call. I’ll be like, oh, fuck me, right? We’re not appreciated until we’re needed.

I understand Black lives matter. Everyone agrees with that. That’s not an issue for me, and it shouldn’t be an issue for anybody else. But when you commit arson and start stealing stuff that doesn’t belong to you, that’s when it becomes a problem. We understand it’s not all of you, but you wanna sit there—I’m sure you’ve seen memes that people have sent around about 1,000 good cops, but if you have 10 bad cops, you have 1,100 bad cops because we’re not holding one another accountable. The same could be flipped, with 1,000 protesters and 10 agitators.

Some of the stuff I’ve seen cops do at these protests is unnecessary. Like, I understand this lady is sitting in front of you and you need her to move. You don’t have to kick her in the face, though. When it comes to enacting reforms [about the use of force by police], most of them have exceptions. So, for example, most departments already restrict shooting at moving vehicles. But if you are trying to run me over with a car, which could kill me, I’m authorized to use deadly force to protect myself or the life of another. In Virginia, we can use deadly force if we have reason to believe the person fleeing has just committed a felony and poses an imminent threat to us or another person. And if I’m authorized to use deadly force, which means it’s a life-or-death situation where I’m in fear for my life or the life of another, I can and will do whatever I have to do to stop that threat. That means I can shoot, stab, beat, strangle, choke—nothing is off limits at that point.

Ramiro Martinez, 41, detective, Temple, Texas

My last 17 years, I’ve seen a big change from when I first started in the attitudes and the culture of policing. It’s been good and bad. Now we’re definitely under the microscope more than we used to be. I wish police departments were a little more transparent in the sense of how we police our own. There’s always this theory that police take care of themselves and things get swept under the rug. In my years in this field, I’ve seen a lot of officers be terminated, a lot of officers be suspended for different violations and breaking the code of ethics. And I think if the public would see that, and we would be more vocal about that, that would kind of help show our community, “Look, we don’t tolerate this.”

When we see [police officers beating people] on the news, we sit there and just chat in the office like, “Man, really, again? What were you thinking?” When we hear about these cops who are slamming people on the ground who are handcuffed and their faces bounce off the concrete—I would vouch for all the guys in my office, none of us would treat somebody like that.

As far as hearing the Black Lives Matter movement, I do hear them. Where I separate myself is when I start hearing the anti-cop rhetoric, defunding the police. A movement that chants, “We want dead cops now,” or “The best cops are dead cops,” I can’t get behind. [Ed. note: When asked where he heard chants like this, Martinez pointed to a 2015 video of Minnesota protesters chanting, “Pigs in a blanket, fry ’em like bacon.”] And that’s not being a cop—that’s just being a human.

""I’ve had to pray. I’ve had to seek guidance from my pastor.""

I grew up in an impoverished neighborhood. My dad was an immigrant. There were six of us living in that home with one bathroom. I’m where I’m at because of hard work. And then I’m now told, “You won’t understand because you’re not Black.” But I’m being told this by Black friends who grew up in wealthy neighborhoods, friends who grew up with parents being very successful. We can go back and look at 100 years ago, and yes, if I was living in that time frame, I would be right there marching. But I’ve seen a Black president.

I’ve been struggling. Friends whom I know, whom I’ve grown up with, say I’m a racist because of the person I voted for, although I don’t agree with everything Trump says. I’ve had to pray. I’ve had to seek guidance from my pastor. After 17 years, I’m on the verge of just saying “I’m done” and turning it in. I never thought I would—I thought I’d be a 30-year cop. But I’m looking for other career choices. I’ve been very vocal with my kids: I don’t want them in this field. I want them to be something else. Because it’s only gonna get worse. They’re voting to [disband] the Minneapolis Police Department. I don’t want my boys to do this.

Katie Miller, 30, former officer at the Metropolitan Police Department in the District of Columbia

I’ve noticed a lot of my former colleagues with D.C.’s police department outright condemning Chauvin’s actions, which isn’t something that I had seen in the past, to be honest. Usually there’s a little hesitation about “Let’s wait and see where the investigation goes.” But when it came to seeing that video, I knew, and my former colleagues knew, that what they were seeing was enough to condemn him morally and obviously that criminal charges would be forthcoming. That vocalness among police officers is something I haven’t witnessed in the past that I find to be really encouraging.

When I was a cop, we’d have conversations about these shootings, focused on understanding the circumstances around them and what went wrong. There was some room for disagreement about whether an officer handled it in the correct way. Tamir Rice’s killing is a good example of that. There was a tactical mistake, and that was driving that car right up next to a person whom you didn’t know anything about. Why would you do that and basically plop your partner out right in front without any cover? In front of a person who allegedly has a weapon? It’s not smart police work. But there was another layer to that conversation that some of the Black officers brought up, which is: Would there have been the benefit of the doubt given to Rice if he were a white boy as opposed to a young Black boy?

""I think there are a number of issues where the old-school police officers are not seeing eye to eye with the rookies and the younger generation.""

Some violence stems from the fact that there’s a lack of manpower in a police department. If you don’t have enough people working your shift, these 911 calls don’t stop. They just keep building up. If you’re working an evening or weekend shift, you’re working those eight or 10 hours straight, responding from one call to the next call. There’s a sort of keep-it-moving mentality. I think that bumps up against a lot of the tactics advocates are calling for, such as deescalation. Deescalation takes time. That means you need to slow it down. When you get to a scene and someone’s upset, instead of having to worry about the three or four calls pending after the one you just responded to, you need to be able to stay and have the space and lack of pressure to say, “I’m gonna take my time and talk to this person and really figure out what the problem is.” A department that’s adequately staffed can afford to have a softer approach to these issues. So in order for calls for defunding police or reducing police budgets to be in the best interest of communities, I think those calls need to be accompanied by a radical rethinking of what we’re asking police to do.

I think the cops policing the protests are beat down, for sure. A lot of them haven’t had days off for a really long time since the protests began. So I think there’s a sense of exhaustion. But I think a lot of social movements in history would prove that these kinds of protests are necessary to change America’s relationship to policing.

I also think there are a number of issues where the old-school police officers are not seeing eye to eye with the rookies and the younger generation. When I was a cop, I had a friend who was new on the police force. He responded to a call, and somebody came up to him and pushed a finger into his chest, as a way to disrespect him. And my friend’s response was not to do anything. And the next day in roll call, which is where everyone gets dogged out for anything that happened the night before, somebody stood up and said something along the lines of, “Yeah, you’re a police officer, I get it. But you’re a man first, and you don’t let another man touch you like that.” That was a total generational divide. Like, there’s something about this man’s work that’s caught up in his gender identity. It represents a rather inflexible form of policing, I guess, to put it nicely.

When you walk into a roll call room, it’s all arranged according to seniority. So all the younger officers have to sit at the front, and the people who’ve been on for two decades, they get to kind of do what they want in the back. They’re smoking and joking, and the people up front are diligently taking notes in their uniform. Their shoes are still shined and everything. A lot of the older officers were working when crack hit D.C. really hard. They always bring up the tagline of D.C. having been the “murder capital.” Like, if they’re training somebody, they’ll say, “All right, you need to listen to me because I worked here when D.C. was the murder capital of the United States.” There’s a sense of pride associated with that. And a sense that some of the rest of us might be used to a safer way of life, to being pampered or babied.

With my family members, I think there was this idea that you need to “back the blue,” especially when I was actually on the police force. They want to support me, so they naturally think this is the side that I’m on, so this is whom you root for. I’ve worked hard with my friends and family to show them that this isn’t as binary an issue as that. I’ve been having conversations with family members about the protests, and especially about the nonpeaceful protesters. I can talk candidly about why that’s not something that upsets me terribly. It’s unfortunate, but also in the grand scheme of things it’s understandable—and effective, to be honest. I think my family can more readily hear that message from me, since I used to be a cop.

The bigger picture to me is the thoughtfulness this is really spurring among police departments and officers, because the situation unfolded as it did and there was space to ask why this happened to George Floyd, to ask why Chauvin felt he could treat this man this way, that undoubtedly keeps pointing back to racism. Police officers often do make split-second decisions, where if there’s any bit of implicit bias, it’s going to come out. There’s a difference between having implicit bias training and a police officer looking inside themselves and seeing that there’s a part of them that’s racist too, regardless of the training they have or how they think of themselves. That seems to be a more abstract but even more important transformation that I think is happening, I hope is happening.

I’m more optimistic about the future of this country than I have been in the past 3½ years. Because up until this point, there was so much apathy, so much frog-boiling going on. It was one outrage after another, people getting tired and numb to it. But [George Floyd’s killing] shocked the conscience so much that it woke people out of that torpor.

""We have to look at police culture, because that wall of silence gets us into an incredible amount of trouble.""

I’m a liberal, transgender police officer. You aren’t going to find many of us. We know that public safety in general tends to attract people with more conservative ideologies. And part of being a conservative is you’re not so comfortable with change and new things. So if you’re taught police are always right, then all of a sudden when I say, “You know, I don’t really think we should be shooting Black kids in the back as they’re running away from us,” all of a sudden, it becomes a threat. It becomes, “Wait a second, are you really one of us?” It doesn’t mean that officers feel like “Yeah, we should be able to shoot Black kids in the back and get away with it,” but it’s more like “Yeah, that was bad, but look at all these contributing factors.”

I once got into an argument with an officer over nasal Narcan. He was a “let these scumbags die” kind of person. But part of the training [for Narcan, an emergency treatment for opioid overdose] is: We humanize people. One of the speakers in the training was a mother with three kids, and two of them had died from opioid overdoses. The third one was constantly also having problems overdosing. She pleaded with officers: “Please, this is my last baby. Don’t let my baby die.” And that was what changed that officer’s opinion. He came up to me later and said: “I was wrong. That really hit home. I’m a parent. I can’t imagine losing my child.”

I think the protests could have a similar effect. But it’s a bit of a razor and people can fall on one side of it or the other. Because if you look at some of the crap that went on in Minneapolis and St. Paul—police are using force to punish protestors. I think that right now, they have a siege mentality, and they are just hunkered down and angry and scared and they’re lashing out.

We also have to look at police culture, because that wall of silence gets us into an incredible amount of trouble. It allows us to justify behavior that we wouldn’t permit for anybody else. Those officers in Buffalo [who assaulted 75-year-old activist Martin Gugino]—when another officer tried to intervene and was pulled back, what message does that send? That message says, “We live, they die.” How do you say that you’re the good guy and yet you cheer on somebody who committed an unnecessary act of violence that resulted in a serious physical injury? That’s a police culture problem. The organizational structures of police agencies are very narrow pyramids. You can train out of a police culture problem, but it comes from the top.

justice,American Spectator,2,https://spectator.org/its-time-for-president-donald-trump-to-pardon-pat-nolan/,It’s Time for President Donald Trump to Pardon Pat Nolan,,"Arnold Steinberg, Jeffrey Lord, Debra J. Saunders, Brian Mcnicoll, Bernard Kerik, Aymenn Al-Tamimi","Last week President Donald Trump continued his push for criminal justice reform , meeting with leading senators , governors , and state attorneys general , plus his key Cabinet officials , to strategize on getting a significant bill to his desk .
Reforming the criminal justice system is arguably the only issue that enjoys bipartisan support . Under President Trump ’ s leadership , “ The First Step Act , ” which would shift the federal prison system from warehousing inmates to focusing on preparing them to reenter society as good neighbors and productive members of the community , passed the House 360-59 , with only two Republicans opposed . For conservatives , there has been a remarkable turnaround on reforming criminal justice .
Thus , six years ago the Washington Monthly observed that the conservative movement “ decided that prisons are a lot like schools : hugely expensive , inefficient , and in need of root-and-branch reform. ” Much of the credit for this extraordinary political shift belongs to a man who has been working tirelessly for more than two decades behind the scenes as the conscience for criminal justice reform . More recently he has been quietly laying the groundwork for the Trump initiatives . That catalyst is the formidable and highly respected Pat Nolan , director of the American Conservative Union Foundation ’ s Center for Criminal Justice Reform . ( More about Pat , shortly . )
Unfortunately , President Trump gets little credit from liberals for his leadership in criminal justice reform .
In addition , a few holdovers from the “ tough on crime ” crowd still resist Trump ’ s stewardship and continue to defend the dysfunctional status quo . More broadly , a clique of top FBI officials and high-level Department of Justice careerists remains intent on reversing the election of Donald Trump . And if they can ’ t “ get ” Trump , they go after his inner circle to bring him down . Civil liberties types have long ( and appropriately ) opposed prosecutorial misconduct . However , now they are mostly silent about the appearance , if not the reality , of the federal intelligence apparatus/FBI/Department of Justice tilt toward Hillary in the 2016 election , and the relentless assault by the special prosecutor to undermine President Trump ’ s legitimacy . As civil liberties guru Alan Dershowitz ( who voted for Hillary but opposes special prosecutor Bob Mueller ’ s promiscuous witch hunt ) noted last night on Tucker Carlson ’ s show , traditional liberal legal scholars and judicial experts seem to look the other way at this double standard .
Perhaps Michael Cohen did violate some laws relating to taxicab franchises he invested in years ago , but what does that have to do with the special counsel ’ s charter to investigate President Trump ? Why ransack the office of Cohen , Trump ’ s long-time lawyer , except for files to leverage against Trump ? And Paul Manafort may indeed be guilty of crimes that pre-date his brief association with Trump ’ s presidential campaign ; the prosecution concluded its case yesterday , and soon a jury will decide . But an overpowering predawn raid to terrorize Manafort and his wife , then no bail , and then solitary confinement ?
In the United States , political investigations have long targeted high-profile conservatives , indicting elected officials like then Governors Rick Perry and Bob McDonnell , Senator Ted Stevens , and House Majority Leader Tom DeLay , only to have their prosecutions overturned . In my home state of California , Congresswoman Bobbi Fiedler , who would have defeated Democrat Alan Cranston in 1986 , was derailed by a Democrat prosecutor ’ s frame-up , only to have her indictment thrown out of court . Still the damage was done , her political career was ended , and Cranston was reelected .
In my book Whiplash : From JFK to Donald Trump , A Political Odyssey , I also chronicle another prosecutorial sham . A few years after the Fiedler case , the Feds targeted a rising conservative star in the once Golden State . Thirty years ago this month , the FBI and the U.S. Justice Department ended the political career of one of California ’ s most popular conservative leaders , then-Assemblyman Pat Nolan , a principled and intelligent man respected for his vision and ability , and for his character , as well .
Like myself , Pat had been a leader in Youth for Reagan ( 1966 ) in electing Ronald Reagan as governor . Only a dozen years later , at the age of 28 , Pat won the State Assembly seat he had grown up in , taking on the establishment in both parties by strongly supporting the Proposition 13 property tax cut/tax limit ballot measure , a state constitutional amendment that started the nationwide tax revolt . Within just a few years , Pat became State Assembly Republican leader . I consulted with Pat as the Assembly Republicans led by him added seats each election ; by 1988 they were within five votes of a majority , at which point Pat would become Speaker of the State Assembly .
This had national significance because if Republicans were a majority in the California State Assembly they would , after the 1990 census , not only control the drawing of state assembly district lines but also have a major role in drawing congressional lines , which could have resulted in a net swing of as many as twelve seats in Washington from Democrat to Republican .
However , on the night of August 24 , 1988 , just ten weeks before the General Election , the FBI searched some Capitol offices . The resulting publicity from the very public raid on Republican Leader Nolan ’ s office sucked the energy from the Republican campaign to win control of the Assembly .
It turned out that the FBI had created a phony out-of-state corporation which ostensibly claimed it would provide much needed entry-level jobs in a severely depressed area . Agents posing as executives of this false business then sought legislation to be allowed to apply for a small business loan with $ 5 million in capital , half the customary , but arbitrary $ 10 million .
The requisite legislation was broadly supported by Democrats and Republicans . So it was clearly absurd for the FBI to later contend that Pat Nolan ’ s backing for the supposed corporation ’ s “ jobs plan ” for a blighted area had to be “ bought . ”
Indeed , it was natural that Pat would support this proposal thirty years ago to bring new jobs to an area of high poverty and unemployment . Pat already was the author of legislation to establish a California version of Jack Kemp ’ s acclaimed national Enterprise Zones : area-targeted reduction of regulations and taxes to attract jobs , especially to inner cities . ( In fact , Pat that year/1988 co-chaired Jack ’ s presidential campaign in California , and they remained close friends until Jack ’ s death . )
Now — a generation later — Sen. Tim Scott ( R-SC ) has taken up the cause . Just two days ago on Face the Nation , Sen. Scott ( R-SC ) thanked President Trump for his strong support of Scott ’ s Enterprise Zones legislation to further alleviate African-American unemployment .
After the legislation passed both houses of the California State Legislature overwhelmingly and was awaiting the Governor ’ s signature , the “ businessmen ” told Pat ’ s staff they wanted to contribute $ 10,000 to his effort to elect a Republican majority . They invited Pat to a hotel suite across from the Capitol . After some small talk , they told Pat they were eager that he be elected Speaker of the State Assembly and handed him a sealed envelope which Pat , in turn , gave to his staff to deposit . He did not know it had two checks , each for $ 5,000 . One was payable to his campaign committee , and the other left the payee blank . Apparently , the FBI hoped Pat would deposit that check into his personal account . Such a thought never crossed Pat ’ s mind ; his campaign team deposited that check into the Assembly Republicans ’ campaign account .
Many Democrats would vouch for Pat ’ s probity . In fact , Assemblyman John Vasconcellos , arguably the most liberal member of the legislature , forcefully defended Pat . FBI agents , in their interviews with Pat ’ s constituents , donors , and staff , and with many lobbyists , were told the same thing : Nolan has integrity . Even his most ardent political foes agreed — Pat Nolan is an honest man .
The Feds faced a double dilemma . ( 1 ) Pat had repeatedly voted for the same kind of legislation long before the phony businessmen contributed to his campaign ; and ( 2 ) Pat voted for their specific legislation before , not after their donations . In sum , how could Pat be bribed to support a bill that he already supported , consistently , publicly , strongly — legislation so popular it hardly required any political arm-twisting .
No wonder there was serious opposition within the U.S . Attorneys office to charging straight-arrow Pat with a crime . So , for a while , the Feds instead focused on several Democrat legislators reputed to be shady . They indicted and convicted three Democratic state senators as well as a Democratic member of the powerful California Coastal Commission .
End of story ? Not quite : They decided they needed to go after a big name Republican .
Thus , an ambitious U.S. Attorney and two zealous FBI agents nonetheless continued to press for prosecuting Pat and contrived to build a case . Desperate , they even investigated members of Pat ’ s family . Then back to Pat . At one point , they asked the IRS to “ find something. ” But the Supervising IRS agent was an honorable man . After reviewing Pat ’ s tax returns going back a decade , he told the FBI to “ do your own dirty work . Nolan has not profited from his office at all . ”
Yet this FBI hit squad remained undeterred and pursued intimidation . FBI agents harassed potential witnesses who vouched for Pat , claiming these decent people somehow must be part of a shakedown operation . When former staffers insisted that Pat was honest , FBI agents threatened to indict them as well , unless they would change their testimony to fit the government ’ s forced narrative . Aggressive FBI agents showed up repeatedly at their offices and even at their homes , often very late at night or very early in the morning .
This government thuggery continued for over five years . Then , a mere 97 days after Bill Clinton was inaugurated in 1993 , Pat was indicted . In return , the holdover U.S. Attorney had told people he hoped that Clinton would retain him in office . Ironically , he was dismissed shortly after he indicted Pat , who ultimately would bear a heavy burden for the unholy alliance between the two ruthless FBI agents and their enabling useful idiot , this self-dealing prosecutor .
To help their implausible case , the FBI had pressured a Nolan staff member to say that Pat had instructed her to solicit contributions in return for Pat ’ s vote . This same woman previously and repeatedly had told the FBI agents that Pat was honest and certainly had not sought or accepted a bribe .
But the agents conveniently made no recording of her five-hour interrogation . Yet , they would later put quotation marks around what she allegedly said , and then insist she made conflicting statements so they could accuse her of “ giving false testimony to a federal officer ” ( 18 U.S.C . § 1001 ) .
When she objected that the supposed quotes were not her words , they responded , “ Who is a jury going to believe , you , a corrupt staffer , or a fine upstanding FBI agent ? ” ( If this standard operating plan sounds familiar , that section of the federal code is the exact basis for the Feds ’ indictment of General Michael Flynn whose crime is alleged perjury , when in fact his “ crime ” is refusing to incriminate Donald Trump . )
In Nolan ’ s case , the FBI agents dragged the woman in for more questioning month after month , always pressuring her to change her earlier testimony . She was living a nightmare : by now , her husband had left her , and she was forced to mortgage her home to pay for her lawyer while she struggled to raise her seven-year-old son alone . The FBI told her that she had already lost her husband and would soon lose her home and then go to prison for so long that her son would be married and have children of his own before she would be released .
The FBI tactics finally broke her will . She buckled under the pressure and agreed to lie : she would testify that Pat had instructed her to get money in return for his vote . But the night before she was to appear in court , she wrote a long statement denouncing the FBI ’ s methods , and saying she only implicated Pat because the FBI threatened the loss of her son . Her attorney wouldn ’ t let her read the statement to the Court , telling her that if she read it , the Feds would renew the charges against her and come down on her even harder .
Using her extorted testimony , the U.S. Attorney indicted Pat for six felonies , carrying potential sentences of more than twenty years . The federal system encourages “ overcharging ” a defendant where conviction on even a single count would bring a draconian prison term . The intent is to force the defendant , even if innocent , to admit guilt in return for a lesser sentence . This all too standard operating plan is a “ win ” for the prosecutors , but a defeat for ( per the Superman narrative ) “ truth , justice and the American way. ” Plea bargaining was supposed to help relieve overcrowded courts ; all too often , it is a tool used to effectively coerce a defendant , often indigent but sometimes even wealthy , to plead guilty to a crime he or she did not commit .
As a consulting and testifying expert in litigation back then , I was involved in several dozen cases , most of them civil , some criminal . For Pat ’ s defense attorney , I conducted a survey , using a sample drawn from the potential juror universe of that federal judicial district . I found that , partly as a result of the negative publicity from previous convictions of state legislators , likely jurors would vote to convict Pat even before they heard any evidence ! Based on my experience and all the data I reviewed , I reluctantly concluded that , despite Pat ’ s strong case and what seemed theoretically a good chance of acquittal , a jury probably would convict Pat of at least one count .
Pat could go to trial and hope to be acquitted ; there was ample evidence that his staffer had been pressured into changing her testimony . Plus , character witnesses would attest to Pat ’ s integrity . But hope is not a strategy . Pat was married and his daughters were ages 4 and 3 , and his son was 10 months . If Pat were convicted , his stacked sentences would send him to prison for so long that he would miss their entire childhood .
So , Pat pleaded guilty to something he didn ’ t do , thereby limiting his separation from his wife and children to 29 months in federal custody . The federal system of extorted pleas reminds me of the way authoritarian regimes interrogate suspects until they finally admit to crimes they did not commit .
Dictatorships have false confessions for public show trials , the United States has plea bargains in public open court . In both cases , the defendant publicly “ confesses ” to the “ crime . ”
I remember , as if nearly a generation ago were yesterday , when Pat called me in the evening to tell me that he would plead guilty the next morning . I was dejected . I realized then how far we had come from Alexis de Tocqueville , whose Democracy in America , a classic of American conservatism , celebrated a sense of community . Indeed , Tocqueville was inspired also by America ’ s aversion to incarceration . As for Pat — he would be inspired by the story of Joseph in Genesis , “ What man intended for evil God intended for good . ”
People of faith believe that “ everything happens for a reason. ” Chuck Colson in 1974-75 had served time in prison . He went on to become America ’ s renowned guiding light as the moral force for Christian prison ministry . Years later , Colson would recruit Pat , while in prison , to become , on Pat ’ s release , the President of Colson ’ s Justice Fellowship . A lawyer , and then a leader in the California Legislature , Pat was uniquely qualified also by his own predicament , that is , his firsthand experience , and his time in prison . He became an effective national leader in all aspects of federal , state , and local criminal justice reform . Not a minister by training , he was — as a spiritual being who had found his calling — evangelical in his advocacy of restorative justice , a reliance on Biblical concepts that even many atheists now recognize as both ethical and efficacious .
Pat oversaw the preparation of “ Friend of the Court ” briefs in defense of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act ( RFRA ) . And the Supreme Court unanimously upheld the constitutionality of RFRA in three separate cases . Pat ’ s work has united Christian prisoner outreach with groups like Aleph , its Jewish counterpart , and also with nonreligious reformists .
I was privileged over many years to volunteer time to help Pat often as he recruited many of our conservative friends and colleagues , icons of the conservative movement with unquestionable credentials — like David Keene and Grover Norquist , and former Reagan Attorney General Ed Meese , and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich — to endorse fundamental change in criminal justice . Pat united in this cause , his cause — a myriad of conservatives : traditional , social , libertarian , fiscal , evangelical , populist . Also , Pat ’ s extraordinary ability to reach across the political spectrum is legendary . That ’ s why so many liberals like Van Jones and Donna Brazile respect and admire Pat and work with him right now to find common ground .
Pat ’ s accomplishments are too numerous to enumerate . In state after state , red and blue , Pat has worked closely with governors and state legislative leaders of both parties to rehabilitate inmates and to pass critical legislation creating major , historic reforms . And on the national level , Pat and his tight-knit group of conservative leaders have been instrumental in the passage of important national bipartisan legislation — including the Prison Rape Elimination Act , the Second Chance Act , and the Fair Sentencing Act .
Perhaps Pat is the only “ ex-felon ” who has participated in three bill signing ceremonies at the White House . It ’ s time , now , as I shall explain , to say “ former-ex-felon ” — that is , for our nation to repair the damage that ambitious bullies in the federal government wrecked on Pat and his family .
Pat has spoken eloquently about the need to incentivize the search for justice . In other words , reward FBI agents and federal prosecutors not for the number of convictions , but for finding the truth , wherever it leads , even if the truth leads to declaring the target of the investigation is innocent .
For nearly two years , Pat has advised Jared Kushner on crime , punishment , and reform . I recall once when Pat was at the White House , seated next to the president ’ s son-in-law as Jared presided over a working session with key experts on prisoner rehabilitation .
I was thinking then that President Donald Trump is actually doing what President Barack Obama only talked about — reforming our broken criminal justice system . And yet , President Trump — as Rodney Dangerfield would say — “ gets no respect . ”
And then I thought about the criticism of President Trump ’ s bold views on pardons and his “ working outside the system. ” But isn ’ t that what the president , as a kind of check and balance on the system , is supposed to do ? That ’ s what our nation ’ s founders envisioned , the president as a “ last resort ” for victims of an all-powerful central government . If Trump were a liberal Democrat , the ACLU would be applauding his independence , his challenge of the inbred enforcement/prosecution/prison complex .
Indeed , the criminal justice complex is , by wide consensus , broken , incestuous , even corrupt . But just as most cops are good cops , there are mainly honest , dedicated , and competent people in the Department of Justice who properly and fairly prosecute crooks , some of whom are politicians . But the terrible abuses within the DOJ must be corrected . And significantly , the DOJ , which is supposed to review pardons , has become the guardian of the status quo , not an impartial , disinterested party . Thus , in many cases , for the DOJ to recommend a pardon in a case in which the Feds acted unethically , the DOJ must at least implicitly accept responsibility for its own dishonest investigative practices and its own prosecutorial misconduct — which mea culpa is highly unlikely .
The DOJ does have an Inspector General . This independent watchdog ’ s investigations actually faulted former FBI Director James Comey ’ s misconduct and later led to the dismissal of FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe , whose successor yesterday fired the also-conflicted and troubled FBI agent Peter Strzok . Perhaps the DOJ also needs an independent “ Director of Pardon Review ” who will not obfuscate , alibi , rationalize , or even cover up , or otherwise try to justify past DOJ tawdry investigations and tainted prosecutions .
That ’ s why President Trump is right to continue to exercise a truly independent review of major miscarriages of justice . And I know of one righteous and long overdue pardon that would not be controversial , but lauded by liberals and conservatives , and by the many good people in law enforcement and send a powerful and noble message .
Pat Nolan should be invited back to the White House to receive a presidential pardon .","Last week President Donald Trump continued his push for criminal justice reform, meeting with leading senators, governors, and state attorneys general, plus his key Cabinet officials, to strategize on getting a significant bill to his desk.

Reforming the criminal justice system is arguably the only issue that enjoys bipartisan support.

But an overpowering predawn raid to terrorize Manafort and his wife, then no bail, and then solitary confinement?

Cohen and Manafort are hardly the only examples so far of the special prosecutor’s collateral damage; and anyone associated now or in the past with Trump apparently is “fair game.” It’s Soviet style — new crimes and old crimes, real crimes and fabricated crimes, false confessions, a lighter sentence or immunity…pressure to testify against the real mark, Donald Trump. “Show me the man and I’ll find you the crime,” famously explained Lavrentiy Beria, chief of secret police for mass murderer Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. “#MeToo” note: sexual predator Beria used his government power to rape hundreds of teenage girls, then imprisoning and even killing some for displeasing him. The communists later awarded a Soviet military hero-general the “honor” of shooting Beria in the head, not for all his rapes, but for (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, you take note:) “crimes against the (socialist) state.”

In the United States, political investigations have long targeted high-profile conservatives, indicting elected officials like then Governors Rick Perry and Bob McDonnell, Senator Ted Stevens, and House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, only to have their prosecutions overturned. In my home state of California, Congresswoman Bobbi Fiedler, who would have defeated Democrat Alan Cranston in 1986, was derailed by a Democrat prosecutor’s frame-up, only to have her indictment thrown out of court. Still the damage was done, her political career was ended, and Cranston was reelected.

In my book Whiplash: From JFK to Donald Trump, A Political Odyssey, I also chronicle another prosecutorial sham. A few years after the Fiedler case, the Feds targeted a rising conservative star in the once Golden State. Thirty years ago this month, the FBI and the U.S. Justice Department ended the political career of one of California’s most popular conservative leaders, then-Assemblyman Pat Nolan, a principled and intelligent man respected for his vision and ability, and for his character, as well.

Like myself, Pat had been a leader in Youth for Reagan (1966) in electing Ronald Reagan as governor. Only a dozen years later, at the age of 28, Pat won the State Assembly seat he had grown up in, taking on the establishment in both parties by strongly supporting the Proposition 13 property tax cut/tax limit ballot measure, a state constitutional amendment that started the nationwide tax revolt. Within just a few years, Pat became State Assembly Republican leader. I consulted with Pat as the Assembly Republicans led by him added seats each election; by 1988 they were within five votes of a majority, at which point Pat would become Speaker of the State Assembly.

This had national significance because if Republicans were a majority in the California State Assembly they would, after the 1990 census, not only control the drawing of state assembly district lines but also have a major role in drawing congressional lines, which could have resulted in a net swing of as many as twelve seats in Washington from Democrat to Republican.

However, on the night of August 24, 1988, just ten weeks before the General Election, the FBI searched some Capitol offices. The resulting publicity from the very public raid on Republican Leader Nolan’s office sucked the energy from the Republican campaign to win control of the Assembly.

It turned out that the FBI had created a phony out-of-state corporation which ostensibly claimed it would provide much needed entry-level jobs in a severely depressed area. Agents posing as executives of this false business then sought legislation to be allowed to apply for a small business loan with $5 million in capital, half the customary, but arbitrary $10 million.

The requisite legislation was broadly supported by Democrats and Republicans. So it was clearly absurd for the FBI to later contend that Pat Nolan’s backing for the supposed corporation’s “jobs plan” for a blighted area had to be “bought.”

Indeed, it was natural that Pat would support this proposal thirty years ago to bring new jobs to an area of high poverty and unemployment. Pat already was the author of legislation to establish a California version of Jack Kemp’s acclaimed national Enterprise Zones: area-targeted reduction of regulations and taxes to attract jobs, especially to inner cities. (In fact, Pat that year/1988 co-chaired Jack’s presidential campaign in California, and they remained close friends until Jack’s death.)

Now — a generation later — Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) has taken up the cause. Just two days ago on Face the Nation, Sen. Scott (R-SC) thanked President Trump for his strong support of Scott’s Enterprise Zones legislation to further alleviate African-American unemployment.

Here’s important background on what happened three decades ago.

After the legislation passed both houses of the California State Legislature overwhelmingly and was awaiting the Governor’s signature, the “businessmen” told Pat’s staff they wanted to contribute $10,000 to his effort to elect a Republican majority. They invited Pat to a hotel suite across from the Capitol. After some small talk, they told Pat they were eager that he be elected Speaker of the State Assembly and handed him a sealed envelope which Pat, in turn, gave to his staff to deposit. He did not know it had two checks, each for $5,000. One was payable to his campaign committee, and the other left the payee blank. Apparently, the FBI hoped Pat would deposit that check into his personal account. Such a thought never crossed Pat’s mind; his campaign team deposited that check into the Assembly Republicans’ campaign account.

Many Democrats would vouch for Pat’s probity. In fact, Assemblyman John Vasconcellos, arguably the most liberal member of the legislature, forcefully defended Pat. FBI agents, in their interviews with Pat’s constituents, donors, and staff, and with many lobbyists, were told the same thing: Nolan has integrity. Even his most ardent political foes agreed — Pat Nolan is an honest man.

The Feds faced a double dilemma. (1) Pat had repeatedly voted for the same kind of legislation long before the phony businessmen contributed to his campaign; and (2) Pat voted for their specific legislation before, not after their donations. In sum, how could Pat be bribed to support a bill that he already supported, consistently, publicly, strongly — legislation so popular it hardly required any political arm-twisting.

No wonder there was serious opposition within the U.S. Attorneys office to charging straight-arrow Pat with a crime. So, for a while, the Feds instead focused on several Democrat legislators reputed to be shady. They indicted and convicted three Democratic state senators as well as a Democratic member of the powerful California Coastal Commission.

To help their implausible case, the FBI had pressured a Nolan staff member to say that Pat had instructed her to solicit contributions in return for Pat’s vote. This same woman previously and repeatedly had told the FBI agents that Pat was honest and certainly had not sought or accepted a bribe.

But the agents conveniently made no recording of her five-hour interrogation. Yet, they would later put quotation marks around what she allegedly said, and then insist she made conflicting statements so they could accuse her of “giving false testimony to a federal officer” (18 U.S.C. § 1001).

When she objected that the supposed quotes were not her words, they responded, “Who is a jury going to believe, you, a corrupt staffer, or a fine upstanding FBI agent?” (If this standard operating plan sounds familiar, that section of the federal code is the exact basis for the Feds’ indictment of General Michael Flynn whose crime is alleged perjury, when in fact his “crime” is refusing to incriminate Donald Trump.)

In Nolan’s case, the FBI agents dragged the woman in for more questioning month after month, always pressuring her to change her earlier testimony. She was living a nightmare: by now, her husband had left her, and she was forced to mortgage her home to pay for her lawyer while she struggled to raise her seven-year-old son alone. The FBI told her that she had already lost her husband and would soon lose her home and then go to prison for so long that her son would be married and have children of his own before she would be released.

The FBI tactics finally broke her will. She buckled under the pressure and agreed to lie: she would testify that Pat had instructed her to get money in return for his vote. But the night before she was to appear in court, she wrote a long statement denouncing the FBI’s methods, and saying she only implicated Pat because the FBI threatened the loss of her son. Her attorney wouldn’t let her read the statement to the Court, telling her that if she read it, the Feds would renew the charges against her and come down on her even harder.

Using her extorted testimony, the U.S. Attorney indicted Pat for six felonies, carrying potential sentences of more than twenty years. The federal system encourages “overcharging” a defendant where conviction on even a single count would bring a draconian prison term. The intent is to force the defendant, even if innocent, to admit guilt in return for a lesser sentence. This all too standard operating plan is a “win” for the prosecutors, but a defeat for (per the Superman narrative) “truth, justice and the American way.” Plea bargaining was supposed to help relieve overcrowded courts; all too often, it is a tool used to effectively coerce a defendant, often indigent but sometimes even wealthy, to plead guilty to a crime he or she did not commit.

As a consulting and testifying expert in litigation back then, I was involved in several dozen cases, most of them civil, some criminal. For Pat’s defense attorney, I conducted a survey, using a sample drawn from the potential juror universe of that federal judicial district. I found that, partly as a result of the negative publicity from previous convictions of state legislators, likely jurors would vote to convict Pat even before they heard any evidence! Based on my experience and all the data I reviewed, I reluctantly concluded that, despite Pat’s strong case and what seemed theoretically a good chance of acquittal, a jury probably would convict Pat of at least one count.

Pat could go to trial and hope to be acquitted; there was ample evidence that his staffer had been pressured into changing her testimony. Plus, character witnesses would attest to Pat’s integrity. But hope is not a strategy. Pat was married and his daughters were ages 4 and 3, and his son was 10 months. If Pat were convicted, his stacked sentences would send him to prison for so long that he would miss their entire childhood.

So, Pat pleaded guilty to something he didn’t do, thereby limiting his separation from his wife and children to 29 months in federal custody. The federal system of extorted pleas reminds me of the way authoritarian regimes interrogate suspects until they finally admit to crimes they did not commit.

Dictatorships have false confessions for public show trials, the United States has plea bargains in public open court. In both cases, the defendant publicly “confesses” to the “crime.”

I remember, as if nearly a generation ago were yesterday, when Pat called me in the evening to tell me that he would plead guilty the next morning. I was dejected. I realized then how far we had come from Alexis de Tocqueville, whose Democracy in America, a classic of American conservatism, celebrated a sense of community. Indeed, Tocqueville was inspired also by America’s aversion to incarceration. As for Pat — he would be inspired by the story of Joseph in Genesis, “What man intended for evil God intended for good.”

People of faith believe that “everything happens for a reason.” Chuck Colson in 1974-75 had served time in prison. He went on to become America’s renowned guiding light as the moral force for Christian prison ministry. Years later, Colson would recruit Pat, while in prison, to become, on Pat’s release, the President of Colson’s Justice Fellowship. A lawyer, and then a leader in the California Legislature, Pat was uniquely qualified also by his own predicament, that is, his firsthand experience, and his time in prison. He became an effective national leader in all aspects of federal, state, and local criminal justice reform. Not a minister by training, he was — as a spiritual being who had found his calling — evangelical in his advocacy of restorative justice, a reliance on Biblical concepts that even many atheists now recognize as both ethical and efficacious.

Pat oversaw the preparation of “Friend of the Court” briefs in defense of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). And the Supreme Court unanimously upheld the constitutionality of RFRA in three separate cases. Pat’s work has united Christian prisoner outreach with groups like Aleph, its Jewish counterpart, and also with nonreligious reformists.

I was privileged over many years to volunteer time to help Pat often as he recruited many of our conservative friends and colleagues, icons of the conservative movement with unquestionable credentials — like David Keene and Grover Norquist, and former Reagan Attorney General Ed Meese, and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich — to endorse fundamental change in criminal justice. Pat united in this cause, his cause — a myriad of conservatives: traditional, social, libertarian, fiscal, evangelical, populist. Also, Pat’s extraordinary ability to reach across the political spectrum is legendary. That’s why so many liberals like Van Jones and Donna Brazile respect and admire Pat and work with him right now to find common ground.

Pat’s accomplishments are too numerous to enumerate. In state after state, red and blue, Pat has worked closely with governors and state legislative leaders of both parties to rehabilitate inmates and to pass critical legislation creating major, historic reforms. And on the national level, Pat and his tight-knit group of conservative leaders have been instrumental in the passage of important national bipartisan legislation — including the Prison Rape Elimination Act, the Second Chance Act, and the Fair Sentencing Act.

Perhaps Pat is the only “ex-felon” who has participated in three bill signing ceremonies at the White House. It’s time, now, as I shall explain, to say “former-ex-felon” — that is, for our nation to repair the damage that ambitious bullies in the federal government wrecked on Pat and his family.

Pat has spoken eloquently about the need to incentivize the search for justice. In other words, reward FBI agents and federal prosecutors not for the number of convictions, but for finding the truth, wherever it leads, even if the truth leads to declaring the target of the investigation is innocent.

For nearly two years, Pat has advised Jared Kushner on crime, punishment, and reform. I recall once when Pat was at the White House, seated next to the president’s son-in-law as Jared presided over a working session with key experts on prisoner rehabilitation.

I was thinking then that President Donald Trump is actually doing what President Barack Obama only talked about — reforming our broken criminal justice system. And yet, President Trump — as Rodney Dangerfield would say — “gets no respect.”

And then I thought about the criticism of President Trump’s bold views on pardons and his “working outside the system.” But isn’t that what the president, as a kind of check and balance on the system, is supposed to do? That’s what our nation’s founders envisioned, the president as a “last resort” for victims of an all-powerful central government. If Trump were a liberal Democrat, the ACLU would be applauding his independence, his challenge of the inbred enforcement/prosecution/prison complex.

Indeed, the criminal justice complex is, by wide consensus, broken, incestuous, even corrupt. But just as most cops are good cops, there are mainly honest, dedicated, and competent people in the Department of Justice who properly and fairly prosecute crooks, some of whom are politicians. But the terrible abuses within the DOJ must be corrected. And significantly, the DOJ, which is supposed to review pardons, has become the guardian of the status quo, not an impartial, disinterested party. Thus, in many cases, for the DOJ to recommend a pardon in a case in which the Feds acted unethically, the DOJ must at least implicitly accept responsibility for its own dishonest investigative practices and its own prosecutorial misconduct — which mea culpa is highly unlikely.

The DOJ does have an Inspector General. This independent watchdog’s investigations actually faulted former FBI Director James Comey’s misconduct and later led to the dismissal of FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, whose successor yesterday fired the also-conflicted and troubled FBI agent Peter Strzok. Perhaps the DOJ also needs an independent “Director of Pardon Review” who will not obfuscate, alibi, rationalize, or even cover up, or otherwise try to justify past DOJ tawdry investigations and tainted prosecutions.

That’s why President Trump is right to continue to exercise a truly independent review of major miscarriages of justice. And I know of one righteous and long overdue pardon that would not be controversial, but lauded by liberals and conservatives, and by the many good people in law enforcement and send a powerful and noble message.

Mccarthy, John Mccormack, Michael Brendan Dougherty, Mairead Mcardle, Robert Verbruggen, Carrie Severino, Tobias Hoonhout, Rich Lowry, John Fund","Well , what would Friday be without the latest document dump from the Clinton email investigation ? Yesterday afternoon , with the public in distracted anticipation of the coming weekend and Monday ’ s Clinton-Trump debate showdown , the FBI released another 189 pages of interview reports .
Along with this document dump comes remarkable news : The Obama Justice Department reportedly gave top Clinton aide and confidant Cheryl Mills immunity from prosecution for any incriminating information located on her personal computer .
According to House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz ( R. , Utah ) , the limited immunity was granted in order to persuade Ms. Mills to surrender her laptop computer so the FBI could check whether classified information was stored on it .
This is very strange . There was no need to grant concessions to Mills . The Justice Department could have required the production of the computer by simply issuing a grand jury subpoena . And had there been any concern that Mills would not cooperate , would destroy the computer , or would “ misplace ” it ( as Team Clinton claims to have misplaced so many Hillary devices ) , investigators could have applied for a search warrant and seized the computer .
In normal cases , the Justice Department does not grant immunity in exchange for evidence when it has lawful power to compel production of that evidence .
Mills is not alone . Apparently her subordinate , longtime Clinton aide Heather Samuelson , was given the same deal .
Unbelievably , Mills and Samuelson , who are lawyers , were also permitted to represent Hillary Clinton in the very same investigation in which , we now learn , they were personally granted immunity from prosecution . That ’ s apart from the fact that both of them were involved as government officials at the time they engaged in some of the conduct under investigation – a circumstance that , by itself , should have disqualified them from later serving as lawyers for other subjects in the same the investigation .
As readers may recall , I have been trying to draw attention to questions about immunity in the Clinton emails investigation since last spring ( see here and here ) . That was when we first learned that some form of immunity had been given to Brian Pagliano . He is the Clinton family employee who serviced then-Secretary Clinton ’ s unauthorized private server and , astonishingly , later drew a large State Department salary while continuing to be paid on the side by the Clintons .
As I explained at the time , it seemed highly likely that Ms. Mills , too , had been granted some form of immunity before agreeing to speak with the FBI . After all , she was a key player in events regarding which the FBI was conducting a criminal investigation , and she had previously declined to be interviewed by the State Department ’ s inspector general . In addition , we now know that , on advice of counsel , she refused to answer many questions when deposed by Judicial Watch regarding the email scandal . We can thus surmise that Mills had concerns about criminal jeopardy . We also know that her lawyer , Beth Wilkinson , aggressively – and successfully – lobbied the Justice Department to prevent the FBI from questioning Mills about topics of great significance to the investigation . Based on all this , it would be very surprising to me if Mills had not been given a “ proffer agreement ” form of immunity before agreeing to an FBI interview . ( As I ’ ve outlined in columns linked above , in a proffer agreement , known in prosecutor jargon as the “ queen for a day ” arrangement , the Justice Department agrees – with some caveats – not to use against the person any statements made during the interview ) .
To this point , we still do not have a clear picture of whether Mills was given any kind of immunity in exchange for agreeing to an FBI interview . We have now learned , however , that she did not surrender her private laptop computer until she received assurance – in the form of immunity – that she would not be prosecuted if the FBI found any incriminating information on it . ( Ms. Wilkinson , told the Associated Press that Mills got immunity only for the computer , not for the FBI interview … but Wilkinson refused to show the immunity agreement to the AP . )
Mills ’ subordinate , Heather Samuelson , who is also represented by Wilkinson , reportedly got the same immunity deal as Mills .
The FBI had abundant reason to suspect that there was classified information improperly stored – i.e. , potentially illegally stored – on Mills and Samuelson ’ s computers . These devices had been used in 2014 ( i.e. , about two years after Mills and Clinton had left the State Department ) in the process of reviewing the 62,000 emails stored on Clinton ’ s homebrew server . It was by this process that Clinton determined which emails related to government business and would be surrendered to the State Department , and which were ( purportedly ) private and would be retained by Clinton . ( We now know that thousands of what Clinton claimed were “ private ” emails were actually government-related , that some even contained classified information , and that Clinton and her minions attempted to destroy all of them – notwithstanding that destroying even one government file is a felony . )
Because thousands of emails containing classified information were included among the 62,000 reviewed on the Mills and Samuelson computers , and because data usually remain stored in the memory of a computer even if a deletion attempt has been made , it was a good bet that the Mills and ­­Samuelson computers contained classified information .
It can be a felony to mishandle classified information by transmitting it to , or storing it on , an unclassified system . Moreover , it constitutes a threat to national security ( and to informants who risk their lives to acquire intelligence for the United States ) to leave classified information on a non-secure private computer that can easily be hacked or otherwise infiltrated . Consequently , the Justice Department had the power and the duty to take custody of the Mills and Samuelson computers .
It does not matter whether Mills and Samuelson were concerned that their computers might contain incriminating information . The Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination only protects a person from being forced to provide the government with self-incriminating information of a testimonial nature ; it does not cover physical evidence .
Thus , when law-enforcement has reason to believe physical evidence could be relevant to a criminal or national-security investigation , it demands the production of that evidence . There is no need to bargain with the person in possession of such evidence by offering immunity from prosecution . Instead , the Justice Department simply issues a grand jury subpoena compelling the possessor to surrender the evidence , on pain of being jailed for contempt if she fails to comply . Further , if investigators fear that the possessor might destroy or tamper with the evidence rather than honor a subpoena , the prosecutor simply obtains a judicial search warrant , enabling the FBI to seize the evidence forcibly .
In a normal case , immunity-from-prosecution never enters into this equation . Immunity is a valuable concession that the Justice Department is only supposed to grant if there is no other way to get the evidence in question . Investigators are not supposed to “ pay ” for evidence the law empowers them to obtain cost-free . If , for example , a prosecutor surmised that a suspect ’ s hair might match hair recovered at the scene of a robbery , the prosecutor would not offer the suspect immunity from prosecution for the robbery in exchange for the suspect ’ s provision of a hair sample . The prosecutor would issue a subpoena requiring the suspect to provide the grand jury with a hair sample ; if there was a match , the grand jury would then indict the suspect for the robbery .
As the Associated Press puts it : “ By including the emails recovered from the laptops in the immunity agreements , the Justice Department exempted key physical evidence from any potential criminal case against [ Hillary Clinton ’ s ] aides. ” It makes no sense to have done this … unless the Justice Department had already decided it would not prosecute Mills and Samuelson , no matter what the proof showed .
Add this to an already long list of startling concessions made to Mrs. Clinton and her confederates . The latest revelations raise other new questions that I will deal with in subsequent posts . For now , suffice it to say , yet again : It appears the Obama Justice Department ’ s goal was not to make a prosecutable case , but to make it appear that Hillary Clinton was “ exonerated ” after a thorough FBI investigation .","Well, what would Friday be without the latest document dump from the Clinton email investigation?

(Ms. Wilkinson, told the Associated Press that Mills got immunity only for the computer, not for the FBI interview … but Wilkinson refused to show the immunity agreement to the AP.)

Mills’ subordinate, Heather Samuelson, who is also represented by Wilkinson, reportedly got the same immunity deal as Mills.

The FBI had abundant reason to suspect that there was classified information improperly stored – i.e., potentially illegally stored – on Mills and Samuelson’s computers. These devices had been used in 2014 (i.e., about two years after Mills and Clinton had left the State Department) in the process of reviewing the 62,000 emails stored on Clinton’s homebrew server. It was by this process that Clinton determined which emails related to government business and would be surrendered to the State Department, and which were (purportedly) private and would be retained by Clinton. (We now know that thousands of what Clinton claimed were “private” emails were actually government-related, that some even contained classified information, and that Clinton and her minions attempted to destroy all of them – notwithstanding that destroying even one government file is a felony.)

Because thousands of emails containing classified information were included among the 62,000 reviewed on the Mills and Samuelson computers, and because data usually remain stored in the memory of a computer even if a deletion attempt has been made, it was a good bet that the Mills and ­­Samuelson computers contained classified information.

It can be a felony to mishandle classified information by transmitting it to, or storing it on, an unclassified system. Moreover, it constitutes a threat to national security (and to informants who risk their lives to acquire intelligence for the United States) to leave classified information on a non-secure private computer that can easily be hacked or otherwise infiltrated. Consequently, the Justice Department had the power and the duty to take custody of the Mills and Samuelson computers.

It does not matter whether Mills and Samuelson were concerned that their computers might contain incriminating information. The Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination only protects a person from being forced to provide the government with self-incriminating information of a testimonial nature; it does not cover physical evidence.

Thus, when law-enforcement has reason to believe physical evidence could be relevant to a criminal or national-security investigation, it demands the production of that evidence. There is no need to bargain with the person in possession of such evidence by offering immunity from prosecution. Instead, the Justice Department simply issues a grand jury subpoena compelling the possessor to surrender the evidence, on pain of being jailed for contempt if she fails to comply. Further, if investigators fear that the possessor might destroy or tamper with the evidence rather than honor a subpoena, the prosecutor simply obtains a judicial search warrant, enabling the FBI to seize the evidence forcibly.

In a normal case, immunity-from-prosecution never enters into this equation. Immunity is a valuable concession that the Justice Department is only supposed to grant if there is no other way to get the evidence in question. Investigators are not supposed to “pay” for evidence the law empowers them to obtain cost-free. If, for example, a prosecutor surmised that a suspect’s hair might match hair recovered at the scene of a robbery, the prosecutor would not offer the suspect immunity from prosecution for the robbery in exchange for the suspect’s provision of a hair sample. The prosecutor would issue a subpoena requiring the suspect to provide the grand jury with a hair sample; if there was a match, the grand jury would then indict the suspect for the robbery.

As the Associated Press puts it: “By including the emails recovered from the laptops in the immunity agreements, the Justice Department exempted key physical evidence from any potential criminal case against [Hillary Clinton’s] aides.” It makes no sense to have done this … unless the Justice Department had already decided it would not prosecute Mills and Samuelson, no matter what the proof showed.

Add this to an already long list of startling concessions made to Mrs. Clinton and her confederates. The latest revelations raise other new questions that I will deal with in subsequent posts. For now, suffice it to say, yet again: It appears the Obama Justice Department’s goal was not to make a prosecutable case, but to make it appear that Hillary Clinton was “exonerated” after a thorough FBI investigation.",www.nationalreview.com,right,Uk2DLWTOzwgl0JyP

The charge was brought as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller ’ s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and possible coordination with members of the Trump campaign , and it brings Mr. Mueller ’ s probe for the first time into the president ’ s inner circle .
Mr. Flynn , a lieutenant general in the Army , was the president ’ s top national security aide for a month until he resigned in February for having misled Vice President Mike Pence about the extent of his contacts with Russia ’ s ambassador to the U.S .
Appearing in federal court in Washington , Mr. Flynn acknowledged Friday that he was cooperating with the special counsel ’ s investigation . Lying to the FBI carries a penalty of up to five years in prison .
As Mr. Flynn left the federal courthouse Friday morning , he was greeted with chants of “ lock him up ” from protesters .
At the White House , Mr. Trump and his legal team apparently learned about Mr. Flynn ’ s guilty plea via news reports Friday morning . The president ’ s lawyer , Ty Cobb , said “ nothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than Mr. Flynn . ”
“ The false statements involved mirror the false statements to White House officials which resulted in his resignation in February of this year , ” Mr. Cobb said in a statement provided by the White House . “ The conclusion of this phase of the special counsel ’ s work demonstrates again that the special counsel is moving with all deliberate speed and clears the way for a prompt and reasonable conclusion . ”
He called Mr. Flynn “ a former National Security Advisor at the White House for 25 days during the Trump administration , and a former Obama administration official . ”
Documents filed in the case indicate Mr. Flynn was facilitating discussions between the ambassador and high level Trump officials about Russian affairs before Mr. Trump was sworn into office on Jan. 20 .
According to court documents , the day after President Barack Obama signed an executive order announcing sanctions against Russia over its interference in the 2016 election , Mr. Flynn called a senior official on the Trump presidential transition team to ask what he should tell Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak about the sanctions .
The official was at Mr. Trump ’ s Mara-Lago resort with other officials discussed with Mr. Flynn how the sanctions could impact the incoming administration ’ s foreign-policy agenda .
After the call , Mr. Flynn spoke again with Mr. Kislyak to tell him not to let Russia “ escalate the situation and only to respond to the U.S. sanctions in a reciprocal manner . ”
The following day , Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow would not retaliate against the U.S. over the sanctions . Mr. Trump praised the announcement on Twitter .
“ Great move on delay ( by V. Putin ) — I always knew he was very smart ! ” Mr. Trump wrote .
The false statement charge stems from a Jan. 24 interview FBI agents had with Mr. Flynn about his interactions with Mr. Kislyak . The interview was conducted just four days after Mr. Trump was sworn into office .
The court documents indicate that Mr. Flynn also said he did not remember Mr. Kislyak later telling him that Russia had chosen a moderate response to the sanctions as a result of his requests .
Prosecutors also assert that Mr. Flynn lied when he told investigators that he did not ask Mr. Kislyak to delay the vote on a pending United Nations Security Council resolution .
Stocks fell sharply on Friday after ABC News reported that Mr. Flynn intended to testify that Mr. Trump directed him to make contact with the Russians .
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped more than 300 points before rebounding slightly , reports CNBC . The S & P 500 and NASDQ also dropped in wake of the report .
Mark Corallo , a Republican strategist who worked for a time on Mr. Trump ’ s legal team this year , said he doesn ’ t believe the Flynn guilty plea will lead necessarily to more charges for aides close to the president or the president himself . He noted that the FBI has been investigating allegations about Russian meddling for nearly two years .
“ If they found nothing in that time to tie the president to Russia collusion , I don ’ t see it coming now , ” Mr. Corallo said . “ We may be seeing the end . I don ’ t think they ’ re going to find anything linking the president to cooperating with the Russians on meddling in our election . ”
Mr. Flynn ’ s guilty plea , the most ominous legal development yet for the president ’ s inner circle , came on the same day that Mr. Trump was expected to score the biggest legislative victory as the Senate was poised to approve his tax-cut plan .
Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California , ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee , said the guilty plea by Mr. Flynn “ is about more than just lying to the FBI . What he lied about and when he did it are of even greater significance . ”
“ This shows a Trump associate negotiating with the Russians against U.S. policy and interests before Donald Trump took office and after it was announced that Russia had interfered in our election , ” she said . “ That ’ s a stunning revelation and could be a violation of the Logan Act , which forbids unauthorized U.S. citizens from negotiating with a foreign power . ”
She said investigators must determine “ whether Flynn spoke with the Russians on his own initiative and who knew and approved of his actions . This is just one more proof point that these investigations must be allowed to continue without interference . ”
Sen. Tim Kaine , Virginia Democrat who was Hillary Clinton ’ s running mate in 2016 , said the charge against Mr. Flynn is “ very disturbing . ”
Asked by reporters about Mr. Flynn joining the Republican National Convention in a chant of “ lock her up ” over Mrs. Clinton ’ s use of a private email server , Mr. Kaine replied , “ He would not give the benefit of a fair legal process to anybody else but he gets the benefit of fair legal process . ”

justice,National Review,2,https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/07/federal-district-judges-should-not-make-immigration-law-for-whole-country/,Why Should a Single Federal Judge Be Able to Make Law for the Whole Country?,2018-07-08,"John Fund, John Mccormack, Michael Brendan Dougherty, Mairead Mcardle, Robert Verbruggen, Carrie Severino, Tobias Hoonhout, Rich Lowry","A protester outside the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco , Calif. , February 7 , 2017 . ( Noah Berger/Reuters )
While we fill a Supreme Court vacancy , let ’ s also have that debate .
Whenever there is a Supreme Court vacancy , I view it as a chance to teach voters about the courts and their legitimate role in our government . We could use that . Last year , the Annenberg Center found that only 26 percent of those it surveyed could name the three branches of government ( executive , judicial , and legislative ) . A full 33 percent couldn ’ t name even one branch .
Confusion about the proper role of the courts extends to many of our sitting judges . Last month , while the Supreme Court narrowly upheld the so-called Trump travel ban , Justice Clarence Thomas raised an issue that the next Supreme Court justice may have to weigh in on . Why is it , he asked , that a single federal district judge can impose an injunction blocking a presidential executive order in all 50 states even if none of his colleagues ( 599 district judges ) thinks it ’ s a good idea ?
These injunctions are beginning to take a toll on the federal court system — preventing legal questions from percolating through the federal courts , encouraging forum shopping , and making every case a national emergency for the courts and for the Executive Branch . I am skeptical that district courts have the authority to enter universal injunctions . These injunctions did not emerge until a century and a half after the founding . And they appear to be inconsistent with longstanding limits on equitable relief and the power of Article III courts . If their popularity continues , this Court must address their legality .
Since January 2017 , the “ resistance ” to President Trump has succeeded in getting 22 injunctions against his actions on issues ranging from the “ Dreamers ” to sanctuary cities and transgender policy in the military .
The U.S. survived without judges ’ imposing nationwide injunctions for the vast majority of its history . The first such injunction came in a 1963 minimum-wage case , in which the D.C . Circuit Court ruled that executive-branch officials should honor a court decision “ in all cases of essentially the same character. ” But such injunctions have been rare until , well , the Trump administration .
Justice Thomas says their recent explosion calls for a rethinking of their validity because “ no statute expressly grants district courts the power to issue universal injunctions. ” He concludes that , as used today , they “ boi [ l ] down to a policy judgment ” about how judges define the limits of a president ’ s power . But that judgment is supposed to spring from the Constitution , not from the preferences of a black-robed figure .

(Noah Berger/Reuters)

While we fill a Supreme Court vacancy, let’s also have that debate.

Whenever there is a Supreme Court vacancy, I view it as a chance to teach voters about the courts and their legitimate role in our government. We could use that. Last year, the Annenberg Center found that only 26 percent of those it surveyed could name the three branches of government (executive, judicial, and legislative). A full 33 percent couldn’t name even one branch.

Confusion about the proper role of the courts extends to many of our sitting judges. Last month, while the Supreme Court narrowly upheld the so-called Trump travel ban, Justice Clarence Thomas raised an issue that the next Supreme Court justice may have to weigh in on. Why is it, he asked, that a single federal district judge can impose an injunction blocking a presidential executive order in all 50 states even if none of his colleagues (599 district judges) thinks it’s a good idea?

Justice Thomas wrote:

These injunctions are beginning to take a toll on the federal court system — preventing legal questions from percolating through the federal courts, encouraging forum shopping, and making every case a national emergency for the courts and for the Executive Branch. I am skeptical that district courts have the authority to enter universal injunctions. These injunctions did not emerge until a century and a half after the founding. And they appear to be inconsistent with longstanding limits on equitable relief and the power of Article III courts. If their popularity continues, this Court must address their legality.

Since January 2017, the “resistance” to President Trump has succeeded in getting 22 injunctions against his actions on issues ranging from the “Dreamers” to sanctuary cities and transgender policy in the military.

The U.S. survived without judges’ imposing nationwide injunctions for the vast majority of its history. The first such injunction came in a 1963 minimum-wage case, in which the D.C. Circuit Court ruled that executive-branch officials should honor a court decision “in all cases of essentially the same character.” But such injunctions have been rare until, well, the Trump administration.

Justice Thomas says their recent explosion calls for a rethinking of their validity because “no statute expressly grants district courts the power to issue universal injunctions.” He concludes that, as used today, they “boi[l] down to a policy judgment” about how judges define the limits of a president’s power. But that judgment is supposed to spring from the Constitution, not from the preferences of a black-robed figure.

Even after the Supreme Court made its definitive ruling in the 16-month-old travel-ban case, the “Resistance” made clear that it hasn’t given up. On the very day the Court ruled, a total of 16 states and the District of Columbia sued to stop President Trump over his border-security measures. The suit was “forum-shopped” so it would be heard by a federal judge in the distinctly anti-Trump Seattle area.

Parents with children younger than 5 must be reunited by this coming Tuesday.

Ms. Fried was listed as moderator of a discussion with Mr. Biden during the virtual rally on Wednesday , according to Mr. Biden ’ s campaign website which has since removed the webpage . Mr. Maloney ’ s letter was sent to Ms. Fried when she was moderating the discussion , according to Mr. Maloney .
“ It ’ s truly sad to see Nikki Fried exploiting the COVID-19 crisis to further her anti-Second Amendment agenda , ” said Mr. Maloney . “ She can host an online fundraiser for Joe Biden , but she can ’ t accept online applications for concealed weapons licenses ? Commissioner Fried needs to stop infringing on the constitutional right of Floridians to protect themselves and their families . ”
Ms. Fried wrote to Florida state attorney general Ashley Moody last week to explain that the decision to stop concealed weapons license applications online was made to prevent frustration from applicants unable to get fingerprinted and because Ms. Fried ’ s department had no mechanism to refund denied applications . Ms. Fried ’ s offices were closed until Thursday because of social distancing guidelines , and her office did not immediately respond to request for comment .
“ [ W ] hile you have selectively chosen to limit the manner in which applications to obtain a concealed weapons license may be submitted to the Department under the cover of the COVID-19 pandemic , you have not done the same across the board for all other online applications your Department accepts that require fingerprinting , ” Mr. Maloney wrote in his letter on Wednesday . “ It is arbitrary and capricious for you to allow Floridians on one hand to apply for a Hemp Cultivating License online during the COVID-19 pandemic , which requires fingerprints , but at the same time prohibit Floridians from applying for a concealed weapons license online . ”
Open carry of a firearm in Florida is only lawful under certain circumstances , such as for target shooting and hunting . By closing her department ’ s offices and suspending online applications for concealed carry , Mr. Maloney ’ s avenues for lawfully obtaining a firearm were substantially lessened by Ms. Fried ’ s actions .
“ It is not for you or the Department to decide how and if an applicant may meet the criteria for obtaining a concealed weapons license during this COVID-19 pandemic , ” Mr. Maloney wrote . “ Provided that the statutory elements are met by the applicant , the Department has no discretion , and may not withhold a permit from any individual seeking a concealed weapons license based on any subjective beliefs . ”","Young Americans for Liberty president Cliff Maloney is pursuing litigation against a Florida official for thwarting his ability to obtain a firearm amid social distancing restrictions in response to coronavirus.

In unusually stark language , Mr . Sessions suggested judges could soon face “ calls for their replacement ” if they don ’ t cool it .
He blasted one judge who called the president ’ s policy toward illegal immigrants “ heartless , ” and said another judge put “ the inner workings of a Cabinet secretary ’ s mind ” on trial to pave a path to block the government from asking about citizenship on the 2020 census .
“ Once we go down this road in American government , there is no turning back , ” Mr . Sessions said in a speech to the conservative Heritage Foundation . “ We are seeing it in case after case . When a hot-button policy issue ends up in litigation , judges are starting to believe their role is to examine the entire process that led to the policy decision — to redo the entire political debate in their courtrooms .
Just ahead of the speech Mr . Sessions told The ███ that he saw anti-Trump resistance at play in some of the judges ’ moves .
“ I have to say I think some of it is , ” he said . “ I regret saying that , but I ’ m afraid it ’ s true in some of these cases and if so , it ’ s very wrong . ”
He added that unfair intervention from judges has left the administration in legal tangles , forcing the president to fight senseless and distracting cases .
“ He has monumental responsibilities and no court without serious cause should interrupt the function of government . It takes untold hours and time to deal with these things . It slows up multiple agencies of government , ” the attorney general told The Times .
Judges have been divided in their approach to Mr. Trump .
Some have delved into his Twitter account or looked back at statements he made during the campaign , citing them as evidence that justifies halting policy decisions made by Cabinet secretaries elsewhere in government .
Others , including a majority of justices on the Supreme Court in this year ’ s ruling upholding the president ’ s travel limits , looked chiefly at the policies themselves , saying that ’ s the crux of their judiciary ’ s role in the government overall .
In that case the majority in the 5-4 ruling said Mr. Trump was on firm national security grounds . The dissenters disagreed , with Justice Sonia Sotomayor saying the president overstepped security powers and illegally targeted Muslims .
Mr . Sessions didn ’ t mention that case , but most of the ones he did single out Monday stemmed from immigration-related fights .
He chided one judge who earlier this month issued an injunction blocking Homeland Security from phasing out special Temporary Protected Status for hundreds of thousands of migrants from El Salvador , Haiti and elsewhere .
Federal law says the Homeland Security secretary ’ s TPS decisions can not be reviewed by courts , but the judge ruled he was reviewing the process by which the secretary reached the decision , not the decision itself .
One crux of his decision was Mr. Trump ’ s reported use of an insult to describe El Salvador and some African countries during a closed-door immigration meeting earlier this year , which U.S. District Judge Edward M. Chen , an Obama appointee , said showed “ animus ” that could have poisoned the administration ’ s entire decision-making process .
In his speech Monday , Mr . Sessions also criticized U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis , who last year during a hearing told a Justice Department he couldn ’ t defend a policy “ that is so heartless . ”
Mr . Sessions criticized the judge at the time , telling him to stick to rulings on the law , not to opine about his political beliefs . The judge fired back , saying Mr . Sessions seemed “ to think the courts can not have an opinion . ”
The attorney general replied Monday evening that “ of course a judge can have political and policy opinions . But they should decide legal questions based on the law and the facts — not their policy preferences . ”
Mr . Sessions said that when Congress fails to act , that is a decision . And courts can not step in to do what Congress has decided not to do .
He called that “ judicial encroachment , ” and said it has become so bad that judges are trying to rehash the full decision-making of administrative actors in their courtrooms .
As part of that , judges are increasingly allowing intrusive legal “ discovery ” — the process of delving into records and decision-making to let judges review not just the final decision , but the way it was made .
Mr . Sessions said demanding handwritten notes from Cabinet secretaries or , in a case now before the Supreme Court , ordering the Commerce secretary to be deposed in the Census citizenship question case , goes too far .
“ The Census question — which has appeared in one form or another on the Census for over a hundred years — is either legal or illegal , ” the attorney general said . “ The words on the page don ’ t have a motive ; they are either permitted or they are not . But the judge has decided to hold a trial over the inner workings of a Cabinet secretary ’ s mind . ”
He said it would be the equivalent of forcing judges to reveal their conversations with their law clerks when they were deciding what to write in their opinions , or forcing members of Congress to divulge their discussions with their staffers .

justice,Washington Times,2,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/feb/5/study-finds-high-rates-of-prison-jail-for-illegals/,Illegal immigrants sent to jail at a rate 4 times higher than U.S. citizens: study,2019-02-05,Stephen Dinan,"Nearly 3 percent of illegal immigrants in Arizona end up in state prison or jail during the course of a year — four times the rate of U.S. citizens and legal residents , according to a study that uses federal reimbursements for prisons and jails to try to calculate one of the most important yet elusive statistics in the immigration debate .
In New Jersey , illegal immigrants are incarcerated five times more often , and rates on the West Coast are triple that of legal residents and citizens , according to the study by the Federation for American Immigration Reform .
FAIR based its calculations on federal government reimbursements to states and localities under the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program , which pays some of the costs for holding illegal immigrants in prisons and jails . To make the payments , the federal government must determine whether an inmate is definitely or possibly in the country illegally . FAIR used the number to then calculate overall incarceration rates .
The method is not without controversy . One analyst dismissed the calculations , saying SCAAP data counts are not comparable to other incarceration counts .
But FAIR says the SCAAP numbers are the best calculation because they focus on those known to be arrested on criminal charges and whom federal officials have concluded are in the country illegally .
In the 10 states FAIR selected , they determined that illegal immigrants ended up behind bars at higher rates , per capita .
“ This study should put to rest , once and for all , the notion that illegal aliens commit crimes at a lower rate than legal residents , ” FAIR President Dan Stein said . “ By focusing on states with significant illegal alien populations and that consistently report to the SCAAP program , FAIR ’ s study refutes this erroneous claim . ”
Illegal immigration and its nexus to crime , long a controversial subject , has gained even more importance in recent weeks as President Trump has pushed for stiffer border security — including a border wall — that he says would “ bring crime down in half in our country . ”
FAIR , which advocates for a crackdown on illegal immigration , doesn ’ t quite answer that question , but it does attempt to get at the overall rates of criminal behavior of people whom the government has confirmed are in the country illegally , and then to compare that to the rate of criminality by the rest of the population .
The group took a snapshot of the prison population in a state , using data from the Prison Policy Initiative , then subtracted the number of illegal immigrants the federal government paid to incarcerate in a year . That provided numbers for both an illegal immigrant prison population and everyone else .
FAIR then compared those with estimates for the overall residential numbers for each state .
For Arizona , analysts used 10,300 confirmed or suspected illegal immigrants for which the federal government reimbursed the state and counties in 2016 . They subtracted that from an overall prison and jail population to get a non-illegal-immigrant population of 46,700 .
Each of those numbers was stacked up against total populations . FAIR estimates that Arizona has an illegal immigrant population of 365,950 and non-illegal-immigrant population of 6.7 million . Incarceration rates were 2.815 percent for illegal immigrants and 0.702 percent for all others .
That means one out of every 35 illegal immigrants in Arizona was in state prison or jail in 2016 , which was the highest rate of any of the states they studied .
They did the same calculations for nine other states that have strong SCAAP reporting and account for about three-quarters of the estimated illegal immigrant population in the country .
In each of the 10 states , they found illegal immigrants incarcerated at higher rates . The gap was biggest in New Jersey , with an illegal immigration jail rate 440 percent higher , followed by Arizona , Oregon , Washington and California in the top five .
New York and Nevada came next , with rates at least 160 percent higher , followed by Florida , Texas and New Mexico , with the smallest gap — though even there , illegal immigrants were 42 percent more likely to be in prison or jail than the citizen and legal resident population .
John R. Lott Jr. , president of the Crime Prevention Research Center , said FAIR ’ s research gets around two issues that plague a lot of other research on illegal immigrant crime rates .
Many studies rely on survey data , such as the census , to ask about criminal pasts . But Mr. Lott said that if people are reluctant to take part in the census because they fear answering citizenship questions , then they might refuse to take part or might shade their answers if they are illegal immigrants with criminal records . He said that would skew the results of crime rate studies based on census data .
Another type of study looks at all immigrants combined , without dividing out legal residents and illegal immigrants .
Mr. Lott ’ s research , using data from Arizona that differentiates between immigrants , found that legal immigrants had the lowest rates of incarceration , with citizens in the middle and illegal immigrants with the highest rates of crime .
“ FAIR here has stuff from multiple states indicating that if in fact they ’ re right on all this , it ’ s pretty much systematically true across all prison systems and jail systems , ” he said .
But Alex Nowrasteh , a senior immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute , questioned FAIR ’ s methodology . He said the data used to calculate the overall prison population doesn ’ t link up with the SCAAP data , so trying to make incarceration comparisons doesn ’ t work .
“ The way that the government measures the number of SCAAP prisoners is different than the way they measure any other type of prisoners in the United States , ” he said . “ I ’ d need to measure other prison populations in the same way the government measures SCAAP prisoners because the SCAAP is a combination of both the number of prisoners in prison and the number admitted over a period of time . ”
Mr. Nowrasteh conducted such a calculation for SCAAP numbers nationally , for data from 2006 to 2015 . He found that as a percentage of their respective subpopulations , illegal immigrants are less likely to be incarcerated nationwide than native-born Americans and legal residents . ’
In 2015 , for example , he found the incarceration rate of illegal immigrants at 486.8 per 100,000 , versus 673 per 100,000 for citizens and legal residents .
The SCAAP data that FAIR used doesn ’ t delve into the specific crimes covered , so it ’ s impossible to say from the data whether one population tended toward more serious offenses compared with the other .
Other potential problems with the SCAAP data include the risk of double-counting because the numbers give only an aggregate of inmate stays . If someone is in a local jail and then a state prison for the same offense in the same year , then they could be double-counted .
FAIR , though , says the conditions of SCAAP money — someone must have a felony or two misdemeanor convictions — plus the average length of stay means the rate of double-counting is likely small .
Other studies have tried to get at the illegal immigration crime question other ways .
A study published last March in the journal Criminology found that communities with higher levels of illegal immigrant populations had lower levels of crime . Michael T. Light , a sociologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison , calculated that a 1 percent increase in the unauthorized population meant 49 fewer crimes per 100,000 people — the typical yardstick for crime rates .
Given that , they concluded , immigration enforcement may backfire by raising crime rates beyond what they otherwise would be .
Mr. Nowrasteh , meanwhile , has conducted his own work based on criminal conviction and arrest data in Texas . He found that as a percentage of the population , illegal immigrants amassed 50 percent fewer convictions than native-born Americans , and legal immigrants rated even lower .
Among homicides in particular , of 785 convictions in Texas in 2015 , 709 were native-born , legal immigrants were 30 and illegal immigrants were 46 . That works out to rates of 3.1 per 100,000 for native-born , 1 per 100,000 legal immigrants and 2.6 per 100,000 illegal immigrants .","Nearly 3 percent of illegal immigrants in Arizona end up in state prison or jail during the course of a year — four times the rate of U.S. citizens and legal residents, according to a study that uses federal reimbursements for prisons and jails to try to calculate one of the most important yet elusive statistics in the immigration debate.

justice,The Hill,1,http://thehill.com/homenews/house/341677-house-dem-files-article-of-impeachment-against-trump,House Democrat files article of impeachment against Trump,2017-07-12,,"In filing his impeachment article , Sherman argues that Trump ’ s abrupt firing of James Comey as FBI director in May amounts to obstructing justice and `` high crimes and misdemeanors '' amid the probes of whether Trump 's campaign colluded with the Russian government to swing the election .
“ I think that is utterly and completely ridiculous and a political game at its worst , ” she told reporters Wednesday at an off-camera briefing .
A majority vote in the House , currently controlled by Republicans , is required to impeach a president . Republicans have a 46-seat advantage .
This is the first time a lawmaker has offered an impeachment article against Trump , and it comes as Democrats have debated whether it is politically wise to press the case for impeachment at this time .
that Trump ’ s abrupt firing of James Comey as FBI director in May amounts to obstructing justice and “ high crimes and misdemeanors ” amid the probes of whether Trump ’ s campaign colluded with the Russian government to swing the election .
He cites Comey ’ s allegations that Trump pressured him to drop the FBI ’ s investigation into ousted former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn , as well as Trump ’ s shifting story on why he fired Comey .
“ In all of this , Donald John Trump has acted in a manner contrary to his trust as president and subversive of constitutional government , to the great prejudice of the cause of law and justice and to the manifest injury of the people of the United States . Wherefore , Donald John Trump , by such conduct , warrants impeachment and trial , and removal from office , ” the article of impeachment states .
Sherman ’ s article is unlikely to succeed in the GOP-controlled House , but the California Democrat said he hoped introducing an article of impeachment would serve as a warning to the Trump White House and establish a legislative vehicle in the long-shot event that Republicans endorse forcing Trump out of office .
Sherman so far has only one supporter on his article of impeachment : Rep. Al Green Alexander ( Al ) N. GreenWhy fear should not blind us to the promise of AI : A healthy dose of optimism Trump at rally says impeachment an 'attack on democracy itself ' Democrats raise stakes with impeachment vote MORE ( D-Texas ) , who previously called for Trump ’ s impeachment on the House floor .
Democratic leaders in the House reacted with caution to Sherman ’ s move . Most fell back on the argument that Congress should set up an independent commission to investigate Russia ’ s meddling in last year ’ s presidential election and possible links between Trump ’ s team and Moscow .

“I think that is utterly and completely ridiculous and a political game at its worst,” she told reporters Wednesday at an off-camera briefing.

A majority vote in the House, currently controlled by Republicans, is required to impeach a president. Republicans have a 46-seat advantage.

This is the first time a lawmaker has offered an impeachment article against Trump, and it comes as Democrats have debated whether it is politically wise to press the case for impeachment at this time.

that Trump’s abrupt firing of James Comey as FBI director in May amounts to obstructing justice and “high crimes and misdemeanors” amid the probes of whether Trump’s campaign colluded with the Russian government to swing the election.

He cites Comey’s allegations that Trump pressured him to drop the FBI’s investigation into ousted former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn, as well as Trump’s shifting story on why he fired Comey.

“In all of this, Donald John Trump has acted in a manner contrary to his trust as president and subversive of constitutional government, to the great prejudice of the cause of law and justice and to the manifest injury of the people of the United States. Wherefore, Donald John Trump, by such conduct, warrants impeachment and trial, and removal from office,” the article of impeachment states.

Sherman’s article is unlikely to succeed in the GOP-controlled House, but the California Democrat said he hoped introducing an article of impeachment would serve as a warning to the Trump White House and establish a legislative vehicle in the long-shot event that Republicans endorse forcing Trump out of office.

Sherman so far has only one supporter on his article of impeachment: Rep. Al Green Alexander (Al) N. GreenWhy fear should not blind us to the promise of AI: A healthy dose of optimism Trump at rally says impeachment an 'attack on democracy itself' Democrats raise stakes with impeachment vote MORE (D-Texas), who previously called for Trump’s impeachment on the House floor.

Democratic leaders in the House reacted with caution to Sherman’s move. Most fell back on the argument that Congress should set up an independent commission to investigate Russia’s meddling in last year’s presidential election and possible links between Trump’s team and Moscow.

“Leader Pelosi has repeatedly called for an outside, independent commission to get to the bottom of Trump’s connection to Russia’s interference in our election and to examine ways to protect the integrity of our democracy from foreign meddling in the future,” Ashley Etienne, a spokeswoman for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), said in a statement.

`` The choice of Flynn , who was known as a skilled , if combative intelligence officer during his 33-year career but was forced out as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014 , signals the president-elect ’ s intention to wage an aggressive war on terrorism — possibly without the diplomatic and cultural sensitivities that have been the hallmark of President Barack Obama ’ s approach , which Flynn has repeatedly criticized .
“ Flynn ’ s appointment was confirmed to ███ by a source close to the Trump transition on Thursday night , though it was not clear whether Flynn has responded . In the past , Flynn , 58 , has argued that ‘ Islam is a political ideology , ’ one that in his view ‘ the American Founding Fathers wanted nothing to do with. ’ His hardline views — as well as laudatory statements about Russia — have made him a lightning rod , as did his strident attacks on Hillary Clinton during the campaign , including leading chants at Trump rallies of ‘ Lock her up . ’ ”

He gave a floor speech Thursday blasting congressional leaders for failing to pass a defense appropriations bill and relying on a CR that “ would lock our military into last year ’ s budget and last year ’ s priorities. ” Afterward , he told Military Times readiness will suffer “ if these idiots say they want to go through with a continuing resolution . ”

Rep. Mike Turner (R-Ohio), who has been a leader pushing for more defense spending, had a more positive view. “When we come back in March, the president can ask us to increase the number even more and hopefully we can take care of some of the shortfalls,” he told Morning D.

— THE WAR SUPPLEMENTAL STILL COULD MOVE IN THE LAME DUCK: The Obama administration has also requested an additional $11.6 billion in war funding for Afghanistan and Iraq. House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers said he and his colleagues would try to deliver those funds in the lame-duck session, reports our colleague Ben Weyl. ""That obviously is terribly important,"" he told reporters. ""We want to be sure that our military has adequate resources during this interim period.""

NDAA WATCH — MORE PROGRESS AS FINAL BILL IS WITHIN REACH, after controversial policy riders were dropped as part of the emerging deal on the defense policy bill, we report with Connor O’Brien: “House and Senate negotiators putting the finishing touches on the new defense policy bill are ditching the controversial riders that could draw a presidential veto. The final version of the National Defense Authorization Act will not include provisions dealing with the greater sage grouse or workplace protections based on sexual orientation, according to sources familiar with the negotiations.

“The provisions were two of the major sticking points between the House and Senate versions of the bill and were part of the reason Armed Services leaders were unable to strike an accord in September. … Committee aides and leaders cautioned that nothing was officially finalized until the entire bill was completed. But one House Armed Services member said they’ve been told negotiations on issues where the two chambers differed are all wrapped up. ‘It’s done,’ the lawmaker said. ‘There’s no more negotiations, even on the small stuff.’”

— WHEN WILL THE FINAL BILL BE RELEASED? House and Senate leaders have no reason to wrap up negotiations and put out the conference report until Congress returns after Thanksgiving, not to mention they need to collect signatures from lawmakers who have left town. But it’s a likely item for Congress to take up that first week back.

THE TRUMP TRANSITION — ADD ANOTHER NAME TO THE RUMOR MILL … PETRAEUS, as The Guardian added his name to the now long list of secretary of state candidates: “David Petraeus – the former US army general and CIA director who was prosecuted for mishandling classified information – has entered the race to become Donald Trump’s secretary of state, diplomatic sources said on Thursday.”

— ABE MEETS TRUMP, via The Associated Press’ Michael Astor: “Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he believes Donald Trump is a leader in whom he can have great confidence after meeting with the president-elect Thursday. Abe, who became the first world leader to meet with Trump since his election, was seeking reassurances over the future of U.S.-Japan security and trade relations. He described the meeting as ‘really, really cordial’ but offered few details of their discussion.”

— OTHERS WHO MET WITH TRUMP THURSDAY: Retired Gen. Jack Keane and NSA Director and Cyber Command chief Adm. Mike Rogers.

— WE HAVE CONTACT: The Trump transition team called the Pentagon on Thursday to arrange initial briefings, Defense Department press secretary Peter Cook said in a statement. The first briefings are expected to take place today, Cook said, and the transition team told reporters it’ll be releasing a list of names on the “landing team” coordinating with the Pentagon officials.

DNI SHAKE-UP — CLAPPER SUBMITS HIS RESIGNATION, our colleagues Martin Matishak and Bryan Bender have more here: “Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Thursday that he has submitted his resignation to President Barack Obama and will not stay on past the transition to Donald Trump. Clapper offered the news during his opening statement in a rare open hearing of the House Intelligence Committee after the panel's ranking Democrat, Adam Schiff of California, said he had heard rumors that the spy chief might stay on into the Trump administration.

“That's not going to happen, Clapper said. ‘I submitted my letter of resignation last night, which felt pretty good,’ he said. ‘I got 64 days left, and I think I'd have a hard time with my wife anything past that.’ … The most controversial aspect of Clapper's tenure may have been his statement to a Senate panel in 2013 that U.S. spy agencies were not collecting data on American citizens — a claim later contradicted by information leaked by National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.”

MGM Resorts International has agreed to pay up to $800 million to settle thousands of liability claims stemming from the 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas, lawyers announced Thursday, almost exactly two years after the massacre.

On Oct. 1, 2017, a gunman on the 32nd floor of the MGM-owned Mandalay Bay resort opened fire on a crowd of people at a country music festival, killing 58 and injuring hundreds.

Lawyers representing survivors and victims wanted MGM held liable for negligence because the shooter was able to enter the hotel with luggage that held an arsenal of high-powered, assault-style weapons and thousands of rounds of ammunition.

""He brought in over 20 huge heavy bags over a three- or four-day period,"" Catherine Lombardo, a lawyer representing some of the shooting victims, told NPR last year.

Robert Eglet, a lawyer who has been leading talks on behalf of shooting victims, said in a statement Thursday that MGM's insurance will be paying out between $735 million and $800 million, depending on the number of claimants and that the agreement resolves ""substantially all"" of the lawsuits filed. Eglet said his firm represents nearly 2,500 people who said they were affected by the mass shooting.

An independent claims administrator will be appointed by a court to distribute money from a settlement fund. The payout process is expected to be completed by late 2020, lawyers said.

""While nothing will be able to bring back the lives lost or undo the horrors so many suffered on that day, this settlement will provide fair compensation for thousands of victims and their families,"" Eglet said, adding, ""We believe that the terms of this settlement represent the best outcome for our clients and will provide the greatest good for those impacted by these events.""

Lawyer Mo Aziz, who represents more than 1,000 people expected to file claims, said he hopes the payouts would provide closure and also prompt hotels across the country to bolster security measures.

""In this era of mass shootings, this settlement sends a strong message to the hospitality industry that all steps necessary to prevent mass shootings must be taken,"" Aziz said.

Last year, MGM spurred outrage when it aggressively tried to avoid liability by countersuing victims. The company cited a federal law passed after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks that encouraged companies to deploy anti-terrorism security technology without fear of being held responsible for damages in the event of a terrorist attack.

But now, MGM Resorts Chairman and CEO Jim Murren says that ""prolonged litigation around these matters is in no one's best interest. It is our sincere hope that this agreement means that scenario will be avoided.""

The deal is not an admission of any wrongdoing by MGM, Murren said in the statement.

The 64-year-old gunman, Stephen Paddock, was found dead in his hotel room from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Federal investigators have not been able to identify a motive for the shooting.

What happened?

It has been revealed by the Washington Post that Jeff Sessions, the US attorney general, met Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak on two occasions last year. The first meeting occurred when Kislyak was one of a group of ambassadors to approach Sessions as he was leaving the podium at an event at the Republican National Convention in July. The second incident – in September – was a private meeting held in the then-senator’s office. That meeting took place as US intelligence officials were investigating Russian interference in the presidential election.



Sessions did not disclose the conversations when asked under oath during his Senate confirmation hearing in early 2017 about possible contacts between Trump’s campaign and Moscow.

Why is this important?

The report raises the question of whether Sessions, the nation’s top law enforcement official and a key member of the Trump administration, lied under oath during his confirmation hearing.

Trump associates' links with Russia: what we know so far Read more

Intense pressure over the revelations has led him to recuse himself from the FBI’s ongoing investigation into the Trump campaign’s interactions with Russia, amid accusations that he would face a conflict of interest, and has strengthened calls for a special and fully independent prosecutor to take over the investigation.



The FBI director, Jim Comey, is leading the inquiry, and had been reporting to Sessions, who would have had the power to influence the depth of the investigation and decide on whether criminal charges were ultimately brought against any individuals.



In a wider sense, the development reopens the debate about Russia’s alleged influence over and contacts with Trump officials, just as Trump was basking in the praise of political allies and some pundits for his first address to Congress. Less than a month ago, Michael Flynn, Trump’s national security adviser, was fired when it emerged that he had misled the vice-president, Mike Pence, about conversations he had had with Kislyak.

Could these meetings have been entirely appropriate?

Yes. Sessions was a senior member of the Senate armed services committee and his spokeswoman has said that, in that capacity, he had more than 25 conversations with foreign ambassadors. But the Washington Post asked all 26 members of the Senate armed services committee at that time whether they, too, had met with Kislyak. Of the 20 senators who responded, each said they had not had any such meeting.

Did Sessions lie under oath?

Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, is in no doubt. “After lying under oath to Congress about his own communications with the Russians, the attorney general must resign,” she said.

But unnamed White House officials cited by the Washington Post say Sessions did not consider his conversations with Kislyak to be relevant to the questions posed to him in his confirmation hearing and that he did not remember the nature of his discussions with the ambassador.

As part of his confirmation, Sessions was also asked in written form whether he had had any contact with “any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election”, to which he answered: “No.” If Sessions and Kislyak did not discuss the election, that answer would be truthful.

Has Sessions been suspected of having Russia ties before?

Not really. Several other Trump campaign and administration officials have had contacts with Russia, which you can read about here. But Sessions was a controversial appointment because of vehemently denied accusations of racism, not due to any alleged ties to Russia.

Who is Sergey Kislyak?

The Russian ambassador has been paid a lot of attention by US intelligence and FBI officials. According to his official biography, Kislyak has served in the Russian foreign ministry for four decades. He also served as ambassador to Belgium, permanent representative of Russia to Nato, and as deputy foreign minister. He is considered by US intelligence sources to be a top Russian spy-recruiter in Washington, according to CNN, which cited unnamed US officials.

What happens now?

There are at least three known investigations into the Trump officials’ alleged ties and communication with Russia. They are being led by the FBI and the two congressional intelligence committees. Now that Sessions has stepped back from involvement in the FBI investigation, it will probably give the FBI director, James Comey, more freedom to pursue the investigation without the interference or involvement of Sessions, a Trump appointee.

It is a very simple proposition. Our Constitution vests all executive power — not some of it, all of it — in the president of the United States. Executive-branch officials do not have their own power. They are delegated by the president to execute his power. If they object to the president’s policies, their choice is clear: salute and enforce the president’s directives, or honorably resign. There is no third way.

No one knows this better than high-ranking officials of the Department of Justice. That is why President Trump was right to fire Acting Attorney General Sally Yates.

Over the weekend, President Trump issued an executive order temporarily restricting the admission into the United States of aliens from various Muslim-majority countries, as well as aliens from Syria and elsewhere who are claiming refugee status. Naturally, this has triggered protests by Democrats and the Left. They erroneously claim that Trump’s executive order violates the Constitution, statutory law, American tradition, and human decency.

For inexplicable reasons, the new president left Yates in place to run the Justice Department in anticipation of the confirmation of Senator Jeff Sessions. A faithful Obama-appointed progressive, Yates obviously knew which way the political wind was blowing in her tribe.

Like most Democrats, Yates objects to the president’s executive order. Fair enough. But she is not a political operative, she was a Justice Department official — the highest such official. If her opposition to the president’s policy was as deeply held as she says, her choice was clear: enforce the president’s policy or quit.

During the course of the review , the OIG discovered text messages and instant messages between some FBI employees on the investigative team , conducted using FBI mobile devices and computers , that expressed statements of hostility toward then candidate Donald Trump and statements of support for then candidate Clinton . We were deeply troubled by text messages exchanged between Strzok and Page that potentially indicated or created the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations .
2 ) FBI agent Peter Strzok and FBI attorney Lisa Page exchanged messages about `` stopping Trump '' from becoming President .
August 8 , 2016 : In a text message on August 8 , 2016 , Page stated , “ [ Trump ’ s ] not ever going to become president , right ? Right ? ! ” Strzok responded , “ No . No he ’ s not . We ’ ll stop it. ” 203
When asked about this text message , Strzok stated that he did not specifically recall sending it , but that he believed that it was intended to reassure Page that Trump would not be elected , not to suggest that he would do something to impact the investigation .
3 ) Five agents , not just agents Strzok and attorney Page , expressed anti-Trump , pro-Clinton messages on official FBI devices .
In undertaking our analysis , our task was made significantly more difficult because of text and instant messages exchanged on FBI devices and systems by five FBI employees involved in the Midyear investigation . These messages reflected political opinions in support of former Secretary Clinton and against her then political opponent , Donald Trump . Some of these text messages and instant messages mixed political commentary with discussions about the Midyear investigation , and raised concerns that political bias may have impacted investigative decisions .
The third exchange we identified was on November 22 , 2016 . FBI Attorney 2 sent an instant message to FBI Attorney 1 commenting on the amount of money the subject of an FBI investigation had been paid while working on the Trump campaign . FBI Attorney 1 responded , “ Is it making you rethink your commitment to the Trump administration ? ” FBI Attorney 2 replied , “ Hell no. ” and then added , “ Viva le resistance . ”
5 ) Former FBI Director James Comey inappropriately went outside of the chain of command during the criminal investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton . He also botched the discovery of Clinton 's emails on Anthony Weiner 's laptop and used a personal Gmail account to conduct official FBI business .
We concluded that Comey ’ s unilateral announcement was inconsistent with Department policy and violated long-standing Department practice and protocol by , among other things , criticizing Clinton ’ s uncharged conduct . We also found that Comey usurped the authority of the Attorney General , and inadequately and incompletely described the legal position of Department prosecutors .

Mr . Sessions announced his intention to go before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence to address questions raised last week during former FBI Director James B. Comey ’ s testimony about the attorney general ’ s recusal from the Russia probe .
The attorney general had been scheduled to testify Tuesday about the Justice Department ’ s budget before the House and Senate appropriations committees but decided instead to go before the intelligence committee .
“ In light of reports regarding Mr. Comey ’ s recent testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence , it is important that I have an opportunity to address these matters in the appropriate forum , ” Mr . Sessions wrote to lawmakers .
It was unclear whether he intended his intelligence committee testimony to be public or behind closed doors , but Democrats made their preference clear Sunday and on the weekend political talk shows .
On Sunday , Sen. Ron Wyden , Oregon Democrat and an intelligence committee member , sent a letter to the committee ’ s leadership requesting that they hold an open hearing .
“ These matters , which are directly related to threats to our democratic institutions , are of the utmost public interest . I believe we owe the American people transparency , ” Mr. Wyden said in his letter to Sens . Richard Burr , North Carolina Republican and committee chairman , and Sen. Mark R. Warner of Virginia , the ranking Democrat .
Sen. James Lankford , Oklahoma Republican and an intelligence committee member , said he assumes the hearing will be public .
“ We want to be able to get his side of it — get all the facts out there , ” Mr. Lankford said on “ Face the Nation ” on CBS .
Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California , a member of the intelligence panel , said Sunday that she doesn ’ t “ know whether it is going to be public . ”
Regardless , she said she also wants to see the attorney general appear before the Judiciary Committee , where she is the ranking Democrat .
“ The judiciary staff are all lawyers … and so , there is an opportunity to look at the law with respect to obstruction of justice , to hold a hearing and also to have those relevant people to come before the Judiciary Committee , ” she said in an appearance on CNN ’ s “ State of the Union . ”
Mr. Comey testified Thursday that President Trump asked him to drop the probe into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn , but he said he declined to tell the attorney general about the uncomfortable one-on-one interactions because FBI officials expected Mr . Sessions to be recused from all Russia-related issues “ for a variety of reasons . ”
Mr. Comey told senators that there were reasons he couldn ’ t discuss in a nonclassified setting what officials believed made Mr. Sessions ’ “ continued engagement in a Russia-related investigation problematic . ”
Mr . Sessions , who was one of the first major Washington officeholders to support Mr. Trump on the campaign trail , recused himself from all matters related to the presidential election — including the Justice Department ’ s role in probing Moscow ’ s role in meddling in the election and any ties between Russia and the Trump campaign .
During his confirmation hearing , Mr . Sessions said he did not meet with Russian officials during the campaign but later acknowledged meeting with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak twice last year .
Former FBI Director Robert Mueller was appointed special counsel to head the probe .
Mr. Comey was asked Thursday about the degree to which he thought Mr . Sessions had adhered to his recusal , including whether he was following that decision in relation to his role in recommending the former FBI director ’ s firing .
“ That ’ s a question I can ’ t answer . I think that ’ s a reasonable question , ” Mr. Comey said . “ If I was fired because of the Russia investigation , why was the attorney general involved in that chain ? I don ’ t know . ”
Mr . Sessions was also portrayed in an unflattering light when Mr. Comey said the attorney general had no response and remained silent when the FBI chief requested that the attorney general protect him from one-on-one meetings with Mr. Trump .
The Justice Department rebutted that characterization last week , with a spokesman issuing a statement saying the attorney general responded to Mr. Comey ’ s appeal “ by saying that the FBI and Department of Justice needed to be careful about following appropriate policies regarding contacts with the White House . ”
Mr . Sessions won ’ t be the only high-profile figure to meet with the Senate intelligence committee as it conducts an investigation into the Russia case : Mr. Trump ’ s special adviser and son-in-law , Jared Kushner , and Mr. Mueller are expected to meet soon with the committee .
According to committee staff , Mr. Mueller , who was appointed to his post last month , will meet with Mr. Burr and Mr. Warner , each his respective party ’ s ranking member . No specific date has been set .
According to NBC News , Mr. Kushner , who is married to Ivanka Trump , will provide the committee with documents it has requested , in addition to facing questions from senators . No date has been confirmed for that either .
Republicans used Sunday ’ s talk shows to continue their criticism of Mr. Comey ’ s conduct .
Sen. Susan M. Collins , Maine Republican , said that while it was “ clearly wrong ” for the president to ask that investigation into Mr. Flynn be stopped , Mr. Comey should have told the president his request was inappropriate .
“ There are a lot of people in government that should have tried to set him straight , ” the Republican senator said of the president .
Mr. Comey testified last week that he leaked the memos through a friend to The New York Times after Mr. Trump hinted he may have tapes of their private conversation .
Mr. Lankford called Mr. Comey ’ s leak of his memos detailing his private meeting with the president “ inappropriate , ” though he acknowledged that was “ not damaging to national security . ”
“ I ’ m still wondering why he prospectively wanted to get out his side of his opinion , ” the senator from Oklahoma said in his appearance on CBS .
Sen. Mike Lee , Utah Republican , agreed , though he was unsure whether Mr. Comey ’ s leak of the memos was a crime .
“ I ’ m not wild about the fact that he had these memos leaked — leaked specifically with the intent of prompting the appointment of a special counsel , ” Mr. Lee said . “ That doesn ’ t seem to me to be the kind of thing we want out of an FBI director , an FBI director whose example will affect everyone in a bureau where leaking seems to be a problem . ”","Democrats indicated Sunday that the decision by Attorney General Jeff Sessions to testify to Congress on Russian involvement in the November presidential election isn’t good enough — they want Tuesday’s testimony to be public.

“The judiciary staff are all lawyers … and so, there is an opportunity to look at the law with respect to obstruction of justice, to hold a hearing and also to have those relevant people to come before the Judiciary Committee,” she said in an appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

Mr. Comey testified Thursday that President Trump asked him to drop the probe into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, but he said he declined to tell the attorney general about the uncomfortable one-on-one interactions because FBI officials expected Mr. Sessions to be recused from all Russia-related issues “for a variety of reasons.”

Mr. Comey told senators that there were reasons he couldn’t discuss in a nonclassified setting what officials believed made Mr. Sessions’ “continued engagement in a Russia-related investigation problematic.”

Mr. Sessions, who was one of the first major Washington officeholders to support Mr. Trump on the campaign trail, recused himself from all matters related to the presidential election — including the Justice Department’s role in probing Moscow’s role in meddling in the election and any ties between Russia and the Trump campaign.

During his confirmation hearing, Mr. Sessions said he did not meet with Russian officials during the campaign but later acknowledged meeting with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak twice last year.

Former FBI Director Robert Mueller was appointed special counsel to head the probe.

Mr. Comey was asked Thursday about the degree to which he thought Mr. Sessions had adhered to his recusal, including whether he was following that decision in relation to his role in recommending the former FBI director’s firing.

“That’s a question I can’t answer. I think that’s a reasonable question,” Mr. Comey said. “If I was fired because of the Russia investigation, why was the attorney general involved in that chain? I don’t know.”

Mr. Sessions was also portrayed in an unflattering light when Mr. Comey said the attorney general had no response and remained silent when the FBI chief requested that the attorney general protect him from one-on-one meetings with Mr. Trump.

The Justice Department rebutted that characterization last week, with a spokesman issuing a statement saying the attorney general responded to Mr. Comey’s appeal “by saying that the FBI and Department of Justice needed to be careful about following appropriate policies regarding contacts with the White House.”

Mr. Sessions won’t be the only high-profile figure to meet with the Senate intelligence committee as it conducts an investigation into the Russia case: Mr. Trump’s special adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and Mr. Mueller are expected to meet soon with the committee.

According to committee staff, Mr. Mueller, who was appointed to his post last month, will meet with Mr. Burr and Mr. Warner, each his respective party’s ranking member. No specific date has been set.

According to NBC News, Mr. Kushner, who is married to Ivanka Trump, will provide the committee with documents it has requested, in addition to facing questions from senators. No date has been confirmed for that either.

Republicans used Sunday’s talk shows to continue their criticism of Mr. Comey’s conduct.

Sen. Susan M. Collins, Maine Republican, said that while it was “clearly wrong” for the president to ask that investigation into Mr. Flynn be stopped, Mr. Comey should have told the president his request was inappropriate.

“There are a lot of people in government that should have tried to set him straight,” the Republican senator said of the president.

Mr. Comey testified last week that he leaked the memos through a friend to The New York Times after Mr. Trump hinted he may have tapes of their private conversation.

Mr. Lankford called Mr. Comey’s leak of his memos detailing his private meeting with the president “inappropriate,” though he acknowledged that was “not damaging to national security.”

“I’m still wondering why he prospectively wanted to get out his side of his opinion,” the senator from Oklahoma said in his appearance on CBS.

Sen. Mike Lee, Utah Republican, agreed, though he was unsure whether Mr. Comey’s leak of the memos was a crime.

“I’m not wild about the fact that he had these memos leaked — leaked specifically with the intent of prompting the appointment of a special counsel,” Mr. Lee said. “That doesn’t seem to me to be the kind of thing we want out of an FBI director, an FBI director whose example will affect everyone in a bureau where leaking seems to be a problem.”
