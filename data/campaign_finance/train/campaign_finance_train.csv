With second-quarter disclosures due at midnight July 15 , most campaigns released their figures late Wednesday and into the evening .
Already , just a few months into the race , the figures tell a few clear stories : Hillary Clinton is amassing a huge war chest , Republicans are getting some huge outside spending totals , and this campaign is going to be all about big spending . Here are the numbers and five things they tell us about fundraising and spending in the 2016 presidential race :
1 . Hillary Clinton 's campaign has far out-raised all the others .
Clinton 's campaign has raised more than twice as much as any other campaign yet this cycle — $ 47.5 million . The next-highest-raising campaigns thus far in the 2016 cycle are Republican Marco Rubio ( $ 19.6 million ) , Clinton 's chief Democratic rival , Bernie Sanders ( $ 15.2 million ) , and Republican Ted Cruz ( $ 14.3 million ) . This puts the Clinton campaign 's fundraising roughly on pace with Obama 's $ 46.2 million raised at this point in the 2012 race .
Of course , different candidates have been in the race for different lengths of time . Cruz , for example , announced in March , months before , for example , Bobby Jindal , who announced in June .
One statistic to watch closely in these early months is how much of their money the campaigns have spent already . Donald Trump , for example , has already spent 74 percent of his total receipts . Rick Santorum , Rick Perry , Ben Carson and Mike Huckabee have likewise all spent more than half of their total money raised thus far . Burning through a lot of money fast could help candidates get attention early on , but it could be tough to sustain over a long campaign .
OK , technically this is something we learned not only from the FEC filings but from candidates and their superPACs themselves .
Unlike the campaigns , the superPACs supporting individual candidates did not have FEC reports due today . But some campaigns have released numbers on the gargantuan totals some of those outside groups have brought in . A look at a few of those shows just how much of a game-changer that outside money can be , especially for the candidates whose campaigns are already the most successful fundraisers . Jeb Bush 's Right to Rise superPAC , for example , has reported that it raised $ 103 million , which means Bush has $ 114 million in his corner — 10 times the $ 11.4 million his campaign raised , and enough to dwarf the total raised by the Clinton campaign plus the $ 15.6 million her Priorities USA PAC has reportedly raised .
These superPACs are n't constrained by donation limits ( like campaigns are ) and can still run ads in support of particular candidates . One trade-off is that they are not allowed to give money directly to campaigns , nor are they allowed to coordinate their efforts with political campaigns .
But that does n't mean they 're run by outsiders . Take Clinton 's main superPAC , for instance — it 's run by Guy Cecil , who was her 2008 campaign political director . Likewise , strategist Mike Murphy , who has worked with Jeb Bush since the 1990s , is running Bush 's superPAC , Right to Rise .
One other thing to keep in mind : Even the superPACs and the campaign fundraising do n't tell the full story on how much support a candidate has . Some candidates also have nonprofit groups known as 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) s on their sides — groups that , unlike superPACs and campaigns , do not have to disclose their donors at all , as Washington Post 's Matea Gold reports .
3 . Ben Carson , Rand Paul and Bernie Sanders are the kings of small donors .
Candidates are fond of touting their totals of unitemized donations — FEC-speak for donations of less than $ 200 — as a measure of their grass-roots support . Thus far , the candidates who have taken in the largest share of their individual donation totals from these small donors are Sanders ( 76 percent ) , Carson ( 68 percent ) and Paul ( 60 percent ) .
At the other end of the spectrum is Bush , who only received 3.4 percent of his individual contributions from those small donors . In fact , he spent more of his own money on his campaign than these small donors did .
For her part , Clinton 's campaign had a relatively small share of unitemized donations , at around 17 percent .
Looking just at the major candidates ( which we 're defining here as the people who in the last quarter raised $ 100,000 or more , not counting self-funding ) , the total amount of spending on this election is already staggering : At this point in the 2012 cycle , these major candidates had taken in around $ 83 million . This time , it 's around $ 138 million .
Of course , a part of this spike is that there are far more major candidates this time around — for example , 12 GOP candidates have raised more than $ 100,000 right now , compared with eight in the 2012 cycle . And on the Democrat side , there are three of these candidates this time ( Lincoln Chafee does n't make this cutoff , as he 's largely self-funded right now ) . Last time on the Democrat side , of course , there was simply Obama .
Average it out , and the amount per candidate is around $ 9 million , roughly where it was last time . However , while candidates ' slices of the fundraising pie may not have grown a lot on average , the total pie this time looks to be far bigger .
Trump 's campaign reported $ 1.4 million in receipts — not massive , but enough to beat out a few other GOP candidates , including Santorum and Jindal .
But the majority of that was a loan from Trump himself . His individual donation tallies are remarkably small . Only $ 92,000 of his $ 1.4 million came from individual contributors , and only $ 32,000 of that came via those small , unitemized contributions . To the extent that donations are a measure of support , this does n't bode well for The Donald , despite the fact that he has outperformed many of his rivals in recent polls .
Fortunately , he has plenty of his own money , if his own figures are to be believed . In a Wednesday press release , Trump announced that he is worth $ 10 billion . In a race where Hillary Clinton is reportedly aiming for $ 2 billion in fundraising , Trump at the very least could keep pace with the top candidates on spending . The question then is whether he can keep pace in the rest of the election .","5 Things We've Learned About 2016 Presidential Fundraising

The first major campaign finance data dump of the 2016 presidential race is in, offering a look into how the candidates are raising and spending money. With second-quarter disclosures due at midnight July 15, most campaigns released their figures late Wednesday and into the evening.

Already, just a few months into the race, the figures tell a few clear stories: Hillary Clinton is amassing a huge war chest, Republicans are getting some huge outside spending totals, and this campaign is going to be all about big spending. Here are the numbers and five things they tell us about fundraising and spending in the 2016 presidential race:

1. Hillary Clinton's campaign has far out-raised all the others.

Clinton's campaign has raised more than twice as much as any other campaign yet this cycle — $47.5 million. The next-highest-raising campaigns thus far in the 2016 cycle are Republican Marco Rubio ($19.6 million), Clinton's chief Democratic rival, Bernie Sanders ($15.2 million), and Republican Ted Cruz ($14.3 million). This puts the Clinton campaign's fundraising roughly on pace with Obama's $46.2 million raised at this point in the 2012 race.

Here's how the rest of the major candidates fared:

Of course, different candidates have been in the race for different lengths of time. Cruz, for example, announced in March, months before, for example, Bobby Jindal, who announced in June.

One statistic to watch closely in these early months is how much of their money the campaigns have spent already. Donald Trump, for example, has already spent 74 percent of his total receipts. Rick Santorum, Rick Perry, Ben Carson and Mike Huckabee have likewise all spent more than half of their total money raised thus far. Burning through a lot of money fast could help candidates get attention early on, but it could be tough to sustain over a long campaign.

2. SuperPAC donations totally change the game.

OK, technically this is something we learned not only from the FEC filings but from candidates and their superPACs themselves.

Unlike the campaigns, the superPACs supporting individual candidates did not have FEC reports due today. But some campaigns have released numbers on the gargantuan totals some of those outside groups have brought in. A look at a few of those shows just how much of a game-changer that outside money can be, especially for the candidates whose campaigns are already the most successful fundraisers. Jeb Bush's Right to Rise superPAC, for example, has reported that it raised $103 million, which means Bush has $114 million in his corner — 10 times the $11.4 million his campaign raised, and enough to dwarf the total raised by the Clinton campaign plus the $15.6 million her Priorities USA PAC has reportedly raised.

These superPACs aren't constrained by donation limits (like campaigns are) and can still run ads in support of particular candidates. One trade-off is that they are not allowed to give money directly to campaigns, nor are they allowed to coordinate their efforts with political campaigns.

But that doesn't mean they're run by outsiders. Take Clinton's main superPAC, for instance — it's run by Guy Cecil, who was her 2008 campaign political director. Likewise, strategist Mike Murphy, who has worked with Jeb Bush since the 1990s, is running Bush's superPAC, Right to Rise.

One other thing to keep in mind: Even the superPACs and the campaign fundraising don't tell the full story on how much support a candidate has. Some candidates also have nonprofit groups known as 501(c)(4)s on their sides — groups that, unlike superPACs and campaigns, do not have to disclose their donors at all, as Washington Post's Matea Gold reports.

3. Ben Carson, Rand Paul and Bernie Sanders are the kings of small donors.

Candidates are fond of touting their totals of unitemized donations — FEC-speak for donations of less than $200 — as a measure of their grass-roots support. Thus far, the candidates who have taken in the largest share of their individual donation totals from these small donors are Sanders (76 percent), Carson (68 percent) and Paul (60 percent).

At the other end of the spectrum is Bush, who only received 3.4 percent of his individual contributions from those small donors. In fact, he spent more of his own money on his campaign than these small donors did.

For her part, Clinton's campaign had a relatively small share of unitemized donations, at around 17 percent.

4. It's going to be one huge-spending campaign.

Looking just at the major candidates (which we're defining here as the people who in the last quarter raised $100,000 or more, not counting self-funding), the total amount of spending on this election is already staggering: At this point in the 2012 cycle, these major candidates had taken in around $83 million. This time, it's around $138 million.

Of course, a part of this spike is that there are far more major candidates this time around — for example, 12 GOP candidates have raised more than $100,000 right now, compared with eight in the 2012 cycle. And on the Democrat side, there are three of these candidates this time (Lincoln Chafee doesn't make this cutoff, as he's largely self-funded right now). Last time on the Democrat side, of course, there was simply Obama.

Average it out, and the amount per candidate is around $9 million, roughly where it was last time. However, while candidates' slices of the fundraising pie may not have grown a lot on average, the total pie this time looks to be far bigger.

5) Does Donald Trump need donors?

Trump's campaign reported $1.4 million in receipts — not massive, but enough to beat out a few other GOP candidates, including Santorum and Jindal.

But the majority of that was a loan from Trump himself. His individual donation tallies are remarkably small. Only $92,000 of his $1.4 million came from individual contributors, and only $32,000 of that came via those small, unitemized contributions. To the extent that donations are a measure of support, this doesn't bode well for The Donald, despite the fact that he has outperformed many of his rivals in recent polls.

Fortunately, he has plenty of his own money, if his own figures are to be believed. In a Wednesday press release, Trump announced that he is worth $10 billion. In a race where Hillary Clinton is reportedly aiming for $2 billion in fundraising, Trump at the very least could keep pace with the top candidates on spending. The question then is whether he can keep pace in the rest of the election.",www.npr.org,center,itEuDd5E0EubxXuN

We’ll soon see whether campaign-finance law applies equally to the Left.

In September 2014, conservatives across the land howled in protest as a judge sentenced noted writer, speaker, and documentarian Dinesh D’Souza to eight months in a community confinement center, imposed a $30,000 fine, and mandated weekly therapy sessions after he pled guilty to a petty violation of federal campaign-finance laws. And, make no mistake, he was guilty. He’d asked friends to contribute maximum donations to Wendy Long’s doomed race for New York Senate and then reimbursed them for their donations. Simply put, that’s illegal. Campaign-finance limits would be meaningless if wealthy individuals could give large sums of money through webs of friends and cronies.

The conservative objection was simple — D’Souza may be guilty, but the feds were seeking prison time mainly because he was a noted Obama critic and bestselling conservative author. Even Alan Dershowitz — hardly a conservative — said the case smacks of “selective prosecution” and noted that the use of straw donors was so common that he’d been solicited to participate in similar schemes. In a target-rich environment, the Left had conveniently singled out one of the president’s most strident (and popular) critics. Liberals wouldn’t receive the same treatment.

Or would they? Crying bias is a common defense tactic, and partisan media is all too willing to believe its allies. Indeed, Democratic donor Pierce O’Donnell tried exactly the D’Souza tactic in 2008 when federal prosecutors pursued him for a similar scheme. O’Donnell claimed that the Bush administration prosecuted him for $28,000 in straw donations to John Edwards only because he was openly critical of the president’s civil-rights policies and represented Hurricane Katrina victims in a high-profile lawsuit. He eventually reached a plea agreement that allowed him to keep his law license but required him to spend 60 days in prison, four months in a halfway house, and pay a $20,000 fine.

“We’re building an operation to make sure Donald Trump doesn’t get a second term, and that is a concurrent operation of running in the primary while building an apparatus to run in a general election starting right now against Donald Trump and contesting him in the states where he’s had free advertising by holding rallies and building the apparatus to win a general election,” a Bloomberg campaign staffer told BuzzFeed News.

“We’re already contesting it in those states because we believe Democrats need to be doing that right now.”

The campaign is also moving into the New York Times’ old office in the near future, according to a person familiar with the campaign. The move into the historic New York City building is part of the campaign’s intense, high-paced entrance into the Democratic primary. Since Bloomberg announced that he was running for president, the campaign has hired more than 300 staffers — 100 of those staffers have been sent to field teams across 15 different states.

Before Bloomberg launched his presidential campaign, he committed to spending $100 million on anti-Trump advertisements and has committed $15 million to $20 million on voter registration efforts in battleground states across the country. That’s in addition to his direct campaign spending, which has already reportedly totaled around $100 million since he entered the race in late November.

The Democracy Alliance’s next wave of spending will include “funding programs that listen to voters’ concerns and amplify the policy records — and harm — that the Trump administration and conservatives have caused in Americans’ lives,” according to a spending plan reviewed by POLITICO.

Some Democrats argue the Democracy Alliance, which was founded in 2005 to build progressive infrastructure and counter the power of conservatives like the Koch brothers, does not hold the same sway it used to, as Democrats now have numerous other outlets for big-money political giving.

One of the Democracy Alliance’s most-active and high-profile original members, Tim Gill, is no longer a member of the group, according to multiple people familiar with his status. And though George Soros is still a member of the group, he usually does not attend the meetings.

It ’ s not an impossibility , but we can put the odds on it at 100 million to one . Both NBC and CNN reported earlier today that Team Trump has a big head start on fundraising before Democrats have even gotten out of the gate :
President Donald Trump has raised more than $ 100 million for a re-election battle that is more than two years away , giving him a massive financial advantage over a crowded field of potential Democratic contenders jockeying to challenge him in 2020 . The President raised more than $ 18 million during the July-to-September fundraising quarter through his campaign committee and the joint fundraising operations he maintains with the Republican National Committee , according to his campaign and filings Monday night with Federal Election Commission . That haul means his re-election effort ’ s war chest now exceeds $ 106 million . Trump ’ s campaign ended last month with more $ 35.4 million in available cash stockpiled in its bank account .
Trump ’ s Q3 results may only be roughly a Half Beto , but it ’ s pretty impressive for a race that still two years away . But even that ’ s the not the whole story when it comes to fundraising for 2020 ’ s presidential bid . Add in the RNC and joint fundraising committees , the Washington Post reports , and you get “ a well-oiled , fully weaponized battle station ” :
Together with the RNC , Trump ’ s campaign committee and joint fundraising committees have raised more than $ 337 million , and stockpiled at least $ 88 million of it in cash . Democrats acknowledge that Trump has a head start in fine-tuning the campaign ’ s data and online fundraising capabilities . The president is a top political advertiser on Facebook and Google , and the RNC is continuing to improve the data and email lists that Trump ’ s 2020 campaign will inherit . “ It is really impressive , the money and the operation that the Trump folks are putting together , ” said Paul Begala , a Democratic strategist . As soon as the midterm election is over , he said , Democrats “ had better get about the business of re-arming for the next battle . ”
The primaries have yet to start , and Team Trump and its affiliates have already raised one-third of a billion dollars for the 2020 campaign . How does that stack up against 2016 ’ s numbers ? When the campaigns wrapped up , the final reports put total Trump fundraising ( with outside PAC money ) at a little over $ 410 million ( $ 333 million by the campaign itself ) . That doesn ’ t appear to include the RNC , but even without it , Team Trump is already well on its way to blowing out the roof on its past performance . For the record , Hillary Clinton and her allies raised a combined total of nearly $ 900 million , a target that Trump and his campaign allies could seriously threaten at this pace .
CNN notes that the campaign claims this isn ’ t coming from just the well-heeled donor class at big-ticket fundraisers , either . Almost all of this comes from small donors , officials declared :
Donors who give in small amounts helped fill Trump ’ s campaign accounts . Small-dollar contributions of $ 200 or less represent nearly 98 % of the money he collected during the third quarter of the year , campaign officials said . “ After twenty months in office with unparalleled results for peace and prosperity in America , President Trump has provided the results he promised , ” Lara Trump , Trump ’ s daughter-in-law and a senior campaign adviser , said in a statement . “ And grassroots America has responded to these remarkable results and the booming Trump economy with their generous support of our campaign . ”
The Post sees it a little differently , but either way small donors are remarkably engaged two years out from the election :
Supporters are buying Make America Great Again gear and responding to Facebook ads . A barrage of Republican Party fundraising appeal emails bearing Trump ’ s name and likeness have helped draw in a steady stream of donations of less than $ 200 , which make up more than 40 percent of its fundraising this cycle . “ I need you to defend our agenda , our country , and our Presidency , ” one recent fundraising email reads . Trump has been equally successful at luring large contributions from wealthy donors who support conservative causes . These groups are better organized and act more strategically than any Democratic outfits that raise money from big donors , said Joel Benenson , who was a campaign strategist for Barack Obama .
Obviously , no one puts this much effort into raising money without intending to run . The question will be whether this early effort results in donor exhaustion down the line . Strategically , it ’ s better to get the money later to refuel the campaign machine when maximum effort and activity take place .
That ’ s not the only strategy in play here , though . Raising this much money in 2018 will have a big impact on those who might be considering a primary challenge to Trump next year .

If a Jeff Flake or John Kasich starts taking the idea seriously , they ’ ll find themselves deep in the hole before they take their first step , and might find that the donors they need have already committed to Trump .

campaign_finance,FiveThirtyEight,1,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-happens-when-the-fec-cant-do-its-job/,What Happens When The FEC Can’t Do Its Job?,2019-09-04,Sarah Frostenson,"Welcome to a special edition of ███ ’ s weekly politics chat . The transcript below has been lightly edited .
sarahf ( Sarah Frostenson , politics editor ) : Last Monday , Federal Election Commission Vice Chairman Matthew Petersen announced his resignation , leaving the FEC effectively shut down , as only three positions on the six-seat committee are currently filled and the agency is legally required to have four commissioners to be fully operational .
What this means is that the agency responsible for both enforcing and advising on the nation ’ s campaign-finance laws is out of commission for the foreseeable future . And because we ’ re in the middle of a presidential election … things could get hairy fast .
The FEC has said that it will soldier on , continuing to process filings and other reports , and has called on President Trump to nominate new commissioners and for the Senate to confirm them quickly . But Congress is still in recess and Trump has yet to move forward with appointing new commissioners ( remember , there are now three vacancies ) .
So here with us today to unpack what this could mean for the 2020 election ( and campaign finance in general ) is Dave Levinthal , editor and senior reporter at the Center for Public Integrity .
sarahf : So , first of all , how did we get to the point that the FEC is basically not operational ? And just how big of a deal is this for the FEC ?
dave.levinthal : You can trace the situation back to 2008 , the last time the FEC found itself in semi-shutdown mode because it lacked enough commissioners to legally conduct high-level business .
That year , the FEC went about six months without a quorum of commissioners , until the Senate and President Bush finally struck a deal to appoint new commissioners and get the agency back on track .
clare.malone ( Clare Malone , senior political writer ) : And by “ high-level business , ” we mean things like opening investigations into possible campaign-finance violations ?
dave.levinthal : High-level business would absolutely include investigating allegations of campaign-finance violations . As I wrote last week :
sarahf : So … what can the FEC do in its current situation ?
dave.levinthal : The most notable thing the FEC will continue to do is carry out its transparency function . That means that political committees , political candidates and so on must still file their periodic campaign-finance disclosures with the FEC — documents that tell the public how much money they ’ ve raised , spent , etc . — and the FEC staff will still review and post that material .
But if some political committee screws this up , or for that matter acts in a manner that ’ s potentially in violation of federal campaign-finance laws , they more or less get a temporary pass because the FEC commissioners don ’ t have the power for now to do anything about it .
clare.malone : Cool . I was interested to learn that there ’ s been a lot of discord on the commission for a while . A Democrat and an independent on the committee were apparently irritated that certain investigations they deemed worthy weren ’ t being looked into because the Republican members kept things from moving forward . So in some ways , it sounds like this is the continuation of an already contentious situation at the FEC .
nrakich ( Nathaniel Rakich , elections analyst ) : And Dave , without enforcement mechanisms , there would be no punishment if a campaign does violate campaign-finance laws , right ?
dave.levinthal : Generally speaking , the FEC ’ s law enforcement capabilities are on ice until the Senate approves at least one more nominee to serve on the FEC .
Right now , Trump has nominated one commissioner — a Texas attorney named Trey Trainor who helped stop an anti-Trump movement at the 2016 GOP convention — who he first nominated in September 2017 . But the Senate has yet to give Trainor a confirmation hearing , much less going forth and confirming him .
clare.malone : So … why no hearing ? I haven ’ t really seen an explanation for that in everything I ’ ve been reading .
dave.levinthal : A complex question ! My best crack at it : There ’ s been a tradition — often adhered to , but not always — that the president would nominate FEC commissioners in pairs : one Republican , one Democrat .
But since President Trump has only offered one nominee , the Senate has chosen not to give that lone nominee a hearing . Could it ? Sure . Did it need to ? Not really — until now — because the FEC has had enough commissioners to at least conduct its high-level business .
nrakich : I find it interesting that , in an age where the Senate has gotten more comfortable with consolidating power within one party ( eliminating filibusters for presidents ’ nominees , blocking Merrick Garland ’ s confirmation to the Supreme Court , etc . ) , that this norm of nominating one Democrat and one Republican simultaneously to the FEC has persisted .
dave.levinthal : Numbers at the FEC commission level have been going the wrong way since the beginning of the Trump presidency . In March 2017 , Democratic Commissioner Ann Ravel resigned . And in February 2018 , Republican Commissioner Lee Goodman also resigned . That means the FEC has been operating with a bare minimum four commissioners for 1.5 years .
President Trump could have nominated people filled those vacancies at any time , but he didn ’ t .
nrakich : Not to be too cynical , but in practical terms , how much of an effect does this shutdown really have ? The FEC ’ s enforcement mechanisms are already pretty toothless and can take years to be resolved anyway .
For example , earlier this summer , now-Sen. Martha McSally was fined for campaign-finance violations she made in … 2014 .
She has served two full terms in the House since then .
And despite breaking the rules by taking $ 319,000 in excess contributions , she was fined only $ 23,000 . So there was no financial disincentive .
clare.malone : Right , and we didn ’ t learn about Trump ’ s campaign-finance violations until well after 2016 , so there does seem to be a long lag time on this stuff !
dave.levinthal : I ’ ve heard from more than a few folks who ’ ve made that very point — that the FEC is already so dysfunctional that there won ’ t be much difference .
But even if the FEC deadlocks on investigations , even if it ’ s unable to make affirmative rulings on whether someone broke the law — and this is often the case — at minimum these situations receive a full public airing . For instance , if special interest groups or others vehemently disagree with an FEC ruling , they ’ ll sue the organization .
Think of all the big court cases that have “ FEC ” in their names , with Citizens United v. FEC the biggest among them . Without a functioning FEC , this process grinds to a halt , for all intents and purposes .
clare.malone : Got it . So the shutdown is really affecting the transparency of the FEC .
nrakich : I find it interesting , though , that voters don ’ t seem to care too much about campaign-finance violations . There ’ s some research suggesting that they don ’ t do as much as , say , sex scandals ( probably for obvious reasons — they ’ re much drier ! ) to hurt candidates at the ballot box .
And I assume that most candidates will continue filing disclosure reports even if the FEC is shut down at the filing deadline . But what if they don ’ t ? Would they really suffer any consequences with voters ? I ’ m not sure they would , and that ’ s scary to me .
clare.malone : I think that ’ s in part because it ’ s so much a part of American political culture — and the culture at large — to see big money and politics as linked . There ’ s a perception that there ’ s a degree of unfettered spending going on .
dave.levinthal : While the FEC doesn ’ t have a quorum , if a political committee wanted to stop filing campaign-finance reports or otherwise violate campaign-finance rules , the FEC would not be in any position to do something about it .
Now , the FEC may very well pick up the matter once it ’ s in business again . But for now , political committees don ’ t really have anyone policing their activity in a way that would lead to some immediate penalty .
Said another way : The cops are at the station , they ’ re doing paperwork , but they ’ re not answering emergency calls .
sarahf : So given how critical the situation is , won ’ t one of Congress ’ s first orders of business be appointing the one commissioner Trump has already nominated to get the FEC back up and running ?
dave.levinthal : Actually , Sarah , I don ’ t think there is a reason to think that Congress will make the FEC its first order of business . That ’ s not to say that the Senate won ’ t act quickly . But this is largely in the hands of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and , to a lesser extent , Minority Leader Chuck Schumer .
Also , President Trump plays a major role here . He could theoretically nominate a full slate of new commissioners . He could clean house — float six new nominees . But presidents have largely missed opportunities to proactively replace FEC commissioners . The result : The remaining commissioners continued to serve in “ holdover status ” — serving even though their term has expired .
dave.levinthal : Bottom line ? If Trump wanted to defy political convention — something he ’ s not exactly shy about doing — he could nominate six new commissioners of his choosing .
Legally , he can ’ t pack the committee with Republicans — no more than three commissioners can be of the same party — but he doesn ’ t have to nominate Democrats . He could theoretically nominate three Republicans and three … Libertarians . Or independents .
nrakich : Right . I feel like that would be well within character — but also , I feel like Trump doesn ’ t spend a lot of time thinking about the FEC .
So if you ’ re Petersen , why resign now , knowing it would throw the FEC into chaos ? Was his resignation a surprise ?
dave.levinthal : No , Petersen almost left in late 2017 , when Trump nominated him for a federal district judgeship . But Petersen flamed out of the judicial job when he was unable to answer a string of basic questions at his nomination hearing , and he withdrew himself from consideration shortly thereafter . His consolation prize ? He continued to serve on the FEC .
At the time — December 2017 — CPI wrote that even then it seemed like the FEC had a strong possibility of losing its quorum of commissioners .
So it ’ s not as if this problem somehow snuck up on people .
nrakich : Yeah , I keep coming back to the fact that the public doesn ’ t seem to care about campaign finance .
It ’ s a big problem , IMO , since this is one of the main mechanisms by which we keep candidates accountable .
clare.malone : Well , very few people ever end up serving jail time for these violations , for instance . And unlike a sex scandal , a lot of people will be bored reading about campaign-finance violations .
dave.levinthal : But there are some money-in-politics sex scandals ! ( cough Stormy Daniels cough ) And the FEC plays a role in those … or could .
nrakich : Right , and there are some types of campaign-finance scandals , like when politicians ( for example , California Rep. Duncan Hunter ) use campaign money for their personal benefit , that I think appeal to voters ’ instinct against politicians abusing their office . But I think that ’ s different from , say , McSally ’ s case , where her only crime was accepting more than the legal limit in donations .
I fear Americans see the latter as just violations of arbitrary bureaucratic rules , rather than as an immoral act .
clare.malone : Well , not everyone sees breaking the law on certain things as a moral violation . The law doesn ’ t necessarily equate with morality ! Lots of people might think the ends ( big money ) justify the means . They might not think that the moral universe extends to bureaucratic violations .
dave.levinthal : Great point , Clare , and yes — there are wide swings in opinion on whether the Stormy Daniels matter is a campaign law violation in the first place . ( Michael Cohen certainly has some thoughts on this . )
clare.malone : What about for media watchdog organizations like CPI and Open Secrets , though , Dave ?
dave.levinthal : Our job is to report about the role money plays in American politics . And while most people often don ’ t care about the legal or technical particulars of campaign-finance law , I ’ ve never gotten the sense that they don ’ t care about campaign money , especially in the context of their favorite candidates raising cash .
There are tens of thousands of people every day who make campaign contributions , millions every year . The sophistication of political fundraising has made it as easy as ever to support a candidate or cause . That ’ s why , for example , you see presidential candidates — President Trump and the gaggle of Democrats — raising huge amounts of money from small-dollar donors .
nrakich : Right — and voters do seem to care about the source of the money candidates raise .
For example , every Democratic presidential candidate has pledged not to accept money from corporate PACs , and most have pledged not to accept money from the fossil-fuel industry or federal lobbyists . They wouldn ’ t be doing that if they didn ’ t think voters cared about those issues .
clare.malone : Have we seen any irregularities from any of these Democratic candidates ? Or from the Trump campaign ( this time around ) ?
dave.levinthal : No , but the FEC also won ’ t be in a position to address some novel questions about how political candidates should act . For example , lots of cities have sent the Trump campaign bills for police and public safety costs — related to Trump campaign rallies — that they believe the campaign should pay . The Trump campaign doesn ’ t acknowledge these bills and doesn ’ t list them as debt , or even “ disputed debt , ” on campaign-finance reports . It ’ d be the FEC ’ s job , ostensibly , to figure this situation out . It can ’ t now .
clare.malone : Oh that ’ s really fascinating . NYC certainly saw a lot of controversy over the cost of Trump Tower security right after his election in 2016 .
sarahf : So to wrap , it sounds like as long as the FEC can still perform some of its basic functions ( like getting candidates to file their reports ) , we might not see Petersen ’ s replacement for a while , right ? Where does this political fight head next ?
clare.malone : I guess … nowhere ? Dave is certainly the expert on this , but I don ’ t think there ’ s much political will to replace the FEC positions . And I say that mostly from the point of view of public pressure — there ’ s no incentive to change the course of behavior toward the FEC .
nrakich : As Dave said earlier , President Bush and Congress did finally reach a deal in 2008 the last time the FEC went into limbo because it didn ’ t have enough members . But I agree with Clare — I think this is so far down on the to-do list for both Trump and McConnell .
Maybe the FEC becomes a poor man ’ s Merrick Garland — no action until one party regains full control of government .
dave.levinthal : I talked last week with Rep. Derek Kilmer , a Democrat from Washington , about the broader issue of the FEC ’ s role in government and politics . And he made the case that the FEC needs to be fundamentally reformed and given greater independence and strength .
He even has a bill that would make the FEC a five-commissioner body , which would address the issue of deadlocked votes . The bill isn ’ t going anywhere , but his hope is that Democrats will win everything in November 2020 , and come 2021 , the FEC will be reformed .
So I ’ d say keep a close watch on Schumer in the Senate . If he wants to make a big stink about this , he could . But he , too , has been pretty quiet about the FEC lately . I will also be curious to see if this comes up during the presidential debate next week , since several candidates have been very anti-Citizens United and anti-BIG MONEY in their campaign rhetoric .
nrakich : Yeah , Steve Bullock presented campaign finance as his big issue when he launched his campaign . But in general , I ’ ve felt that the candidates have not done a good job sticking to what was supposed to be their signature issue ( Eric Swalwell and guns , Jay Inslee and climate change , etc . ) .
dave.levinthal : Even though Bullock has made it his signature issue , he ’ s had his own little bumps in the road .
clare.malone : Gillibrand also made public funding a thing , if I recall . That did not catch on .
nrakich : That said , if the FEC is shut down for a full year or more — say , through the 2020 election — I bet there will be more of an appetite to reform it come 2021 if Democrats are in charge .
Just speculating , but I think an FEC shutdown might be the kind of thing that gets more noticeable with time .
dave.levinthal : An FEC that effectively sat out the 2020 election would be monumental . It ’ d take us back to a pre-Watergate era of campaign-finance regulation in certain ways . ( The FEC was created after Watergate to help defend against campaign money problems , irregularities and potential lawlessness . )
In fact , I ’ d say it ’ d be the most incentive Congress has probably had since Watergate to fundamentally change the nation ’ s campaign-finance regulation regime .","What Happens When The FEC Can’t Do Its Job?

Welcome to a special edition of FiveThirtyEight’s weekly politics chat. The transcript below has been lightly edited.

sarahf (Sarah Frostenson, politics editor): Last Monday, Federal Election Commission Vice Chairman Matthew Petersen announced his resignation, leaving the FEC effectively shut down, as only three positions on the six-seat committee are currently filled and the agency is legally required to have four commissioners to be fully operational.

What this means is that the agency responsible for both enforcing and advising on the nation’s campaign-finance laws is out of commission for the foreseeable future. And because we’re in the middle of a presidential election … things could get hairy fast.

The FEC has said that it will soldier on, continuing to process filings and other reports, and has called on President Trump to nominate new commissioners and for the Senate to confirm them quickly. But Congress is still in recess and Trump has yet to move forward with appointing new commissioners (remember, there are now three vacancies).

So here with us today to unpack what this could mean for the 2020 election (and campaign finance in general) is Dave Levinthal, editor and senior reporter at the Center for Public Integrity.

Welcome!

dave.levinthal: My pleasure! Thanks for having me.

sarahf: So, first of all, how did we get to the point that the FEC is basically not operational? And just how big of a deal is this for the FEC?

dave.levinthal: You can trace the situation back to 2008, the last time the FEC found itself in semi-shutdown mode because it lacked enough commissioners to legally conduct high-level business.

That year, the FEC went about six months without a quorum of commissioners, until the Senate and President Bush finally struck a deal to appoint new commissioners and get the agency back on track.

clare.malone (Clare Malone, senior political writer): And by “high-level business,” we mean things like opening investigations into possible campaign-finance violations?

dave.levinthal: High-level business would absolutely include investigating allegations of campaign-finance violations. As I wrote last week:

For now, the FEC can’t conduct meetings.

It can’t slap political scofflaws with fines.

It can’t make rules.

It can’t conduct audits and approve them.

sarahf: So … what can the FEC do in its current situation?

dave.levinthal: The most notable thing the FEC will continue to do is carry out its transparency function. That means that political committees, political candidates and so on must still file their periodic campaign-finance disclosures with the FEC — documents that tell the public how much money they’ve raised, spent, etc. — and the FEC staff will still review and post that material.

But if some political committee screws this up, or for that matter acts in a manner that’s potentially in violation of federal campaign-finance laws, they more or less get a temporary pass because the FEC commissioners don’t have the power for now to do anything about it.

clare.malone: Cool. I was interested to learn that there’s been a lot of discord on the commission for a while. A Democrat and an independent on the committee were apparently irritated that certain investigations they deemed worthy weren’t being looked into because the Republican members kept things from moving forward. So in some ways, it sounds like this is the continuation of an already contentious situation at the FEC.

nrakich (Nathaniel Rakich, elections analyst): And Dave, without enforcement mechanisms, there would be no punishment if a campaign does violate campaign-finance laws, right?

dave.levinthal: Generally speaking, the FEC’s law enforcement capabilities are on ice until the Senate approves at least one more nominee to serve on the FEC.

Right now, Trump has nominated one commissioner — a Texas attorney named Trey Trainor who helped stop an anti-Trump movement at the 2016 GOP convention — who he first nominated in September 2017. But the Senate has yet to give Trainor a confirmation hearing, much less going forth and confirming him.

clare.malone: So … why no hearing? I haven’t really seen an explanation for that in everything I’ve been reading.

dave.levinthal: A complex question! My best crack at it: There’s been a tradition — often adhered to, but not always — that the president would nominate FEC commissioners in pairs: one Republican, one Democrat.

But since President Trump has only offered one nominee, the Senate has chosen not to give that lone nominee a hearing. Could it? Sure. Did it need to? Not really — until now — because the FEC has had enough commissioners to at least conduct its high-level business.

nrakich: I find it interesting that, in an age where the Senate has gotten more comfortable with consolidating power within one party (eliminating filibusters for presidents’ nominees, blocking Merrick Garland’s confirmation to the Supreme Court, etc.), that this norm of nominating one Democrat and one Republican simultaneously to the FEC has persisted.

dave.levinthal: Numbers at the FEC commission level have been going the wrong way since the beginning of the Trump presidency. In March 2017, Democratic Commissioner Ann Ravel resigned. And in February 2018, Republican Commissioner Lee Goodman also resigned. That means the FEC has been operating with a bare minimum four commissioners for 1.5 years.

President Trump could have nominated people filled those vacancies at any time, but he didn’t.

clare.malone: Whew.

Dave, champion explanation.

nrakich: Not to be too cynical, but in practical terms, how much of an effect does this shutdown really have? The FEC’s enforcement mechanisms are already pretty toothless and can take years to be resolved anyway.

For example, earlier this summer, now-Sen. Martha McSally was fined for campaign-finance violations she made in … 2014.

She has served two full terms in the House since then.

And despite breaking the rules by taking $319,000 in excess contributions, she was fined only $23,000. So there was no financial disincentive.

clare.malone: Right, and we didn’t learn about Trump’s campaign-finance violations until well after 2016, so there does seem to be a long lag time on this stuff!

dave.levinthal: I’ve heard from more than a few folks who’ve made that very point — that the FEC is already so dysfunctional that there won’t be much difference.

But even if the FEC deadlocks on investigations, even if it’s unable to make affirmative rulings on whether someone broke the law — and this is often the case — at minimum these situations receive a full public airing. For instance, if special interest groups or others vehemently disagree with an FEC ruling, they’ll sue the organization.

Think of all the big court cases that have “FEC” in their names, with Citizens United v. FEC the biggest among them. Without a functioning FEC, this process grinds to a halt, for all intents and purposes.

clare.malone: Got it. So the shutdown is really affecting the transparency of the FEC.

nrakich: I find it interesting, though, that voters don’t seem to care too much about campaign-finance violations. There’s some research suggesting that they don’t do as much as, say, sex scandals (probably for obvious reasons — they’re much drier!) to hurt candidates at the ballot box.

And I assume that most candidates will continue filing disclosure reports even if the FEC is shut down at the filing deadline. But what if they don’t? Would they really suffer any consequences with voters? I’m not sure they would, and that’s scary to me.

clare.malone: I think that’s in part because it’s so much a part of American political culture — and the culture at large — to see big money and politics as linked. There’s a perception that there’s a degree of unfettered spending going on.

dave.levinthal: While the FEC doesn’t have a quorum, if a political committee wanted to stop filing campaign-finance reports or otherwise violate campaign-finance rules, the FEC would not be in any position to do something about it.

Now, the FEC may very well pick up the matter once it’s in business again. But for now, political committees don’t really have anyone policing their activity in a way that would lead to some immediate penalty.

Said another way: The cops are at the station, they’re doing paperwork, but they’re not answering emergency calls.

sarahf: So given how critical the situation is, won’t one of Congress’s first orders of business be appointing the one commissioner Trump has already nominated to get the FEC back up and running?

dave.levinthal: Actually, Sarah, I don’t think there is a reason to think that Congress will make the FEC its first order of business. That’s not to say that the Senate won’t act quickly. But this is largely in the hands of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and, to a lesser extent, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.

Also, President Trump plays a major role here. He could theoretically nominate a full slate of new commissioners. He could clean house — float six new nominees. But presidents have largely missed opportunities to proactively replace FEC commissioners. The result: The remaining commissioners continued to serve in “holdover status” — serving even though their term has expired.

sarahf: 😱

dave.levinthal: Bottom line? If Trump wanted to defy political convention — something he’s not exactly shy about doing — he could nominate six new commissioners of his choosing.

Legally, he can’t pack the committee with Republicans — no more than three commissioners can be of the same party — but he doesn’t have to nominate Democrats. He could theoretically nominate three Republicans and three … Libertarians. Or independents.

nrakich: Right. I feel like that would be well within character — but also, I feel like Trump doesn’t spend a lot of time thinking about the FEC.

sarahf: Or any president, it sounds like.

So if you’re Petersen, why resign now, knowing it would throw the FEC into chaos? Was his resignation a surprise?

dave.levinthal: No, Petersen almost left in late 2017, when Trump nominated him for a federal district judgeship. But Petersen flamed out of the judicial job when he was unable to answer a string of basic questions at his nomination hearing, and he withdrew himself from consideration shortly thereafter. His consolation prize? He continued to serve on the FEC.

clare.malone: What about for media watchdog organizations like CPI and Open Secrets, though, Dave?

How will your work potentially change because of this?

dave.levinthal: Our job is to report about the role money plays in American politics. And while most people often don’t care about the legal or technical particulars of campaign-finance law, I’ve never gotten the sense that they don’t care about campaign money, especially in the context of their favorite candidates raising cash.

Vogel,"Democracy Alliance conferences are typically kept hush-hush . | AP Photos The left 's secret club
Some of the country ’ s biggest Democratic donors — including Tom Steyer and Jonathan Soros — are huddling behind closed doors beginning Sunday in Chicago with union bigwigs and progressive superstars like Bill de Blasio to plan how to pull their party — and the country — to the left .
The setting is the annual spring meeting of the Democracy Alliance , a secretive club of wealthy liberals that ’ s the closest thing the left has to the vaunted Koch brothers ’ political network .
The DA , as the liberal group is known to insiders , is increasing its ranks of rich donors for the first time in years and is gearing up to spend huge sums on political data , voter registration , ground organizing and advertising to influence the 2014 midterms and 2016 presidential elections . Potentially more significant , the groups ’ donors also could play an important role in determining whether the post-Barack Obama Democratic Party embraces the rising tide of progressive populism or hews to a more cautious , centrist course — in other words , whether the Hillary Clinton wing or Elizabeth Warren wing will seize the reins .
The Spring Investment Conference will feature a number of Clinton allies and others associated with the centrist wing — including Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz , Kentucky Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes and Obama senior adviser Valerie Jarrett . But the conference — which kicks off Sunday night at a Ritz Carlton ballroom with a dinner keynoted by de Blasio — is also seen as a coming out party of sorts for the group ’ s progressives , who have expressed some measure of dissatisfaction with what they see as a level of timidity on their pet issues from the Obama White House .
According to a conference agenda obtained by ███ , panels will focus on elevating progressive issues like income inequality , climate change , drug reform , gun control , abortion rights and the death penalty .
It ’ s not all serious business , though . Social events include a wine party featuring selections from wineries owned by DA donors , a private curator-led tour of the Art Institute of Chicago and a performance by “ The Daily Show ” co-creator Lizz Winstead , who the agenda says will deploy her “ comedic genius ” to take a “ light-hearted look at the conservative Right and the decay of the Fourth Estate . ”
DA conferences are typically kept hush-hush , with locations tightly held , press barred from the sessions and participants prohibited from discussing the proceedings .
Invitations are coveted by all manner of Democrats . Several representatives from Obama ’ s orbit are expected at the Ritz , including White House Political Director David Simas and campaign adman Larry Grisolano . They ’ re participating in a panel on winning health care strategies in state races , while Organizing for Action , the nonprofit group formed from the remnants of Obama ’ s campaign to push his second-term agenda , is hosting donors for an open house at its headquarters . And former Obama political guru David Axelrod is slated to deliver a speech titled “ Reflections on a Career in Journalism , Politics , and the Obama Journey . ”
The courting of rich Democrats in Chicago comes as some of the party ’ s top names continue a discordant character assault on major conservative donors as eroding the very fabric of American democracy . Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has repeatedly blasted the billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch as “ un-American ” and accused them of “ actually trying to buy the country . ”
Democracy Alliance partners , as the group calls its members , pay annual dues of $ 30,000 and are required to contribute a total of at least $ 200,000 a year to recommended groups . Since its inception in 2005 , the DA has steered upward of $ 500 million to a range of groups , including pillars of the political left such as the conservative media watchdog Media Matters , the policy advocacy outfit Center for American Progress and the data firm Catalist — all of which are run by Clinton allies .
While those groups will be represented in Chicago , DA insiders and observers are watching the conference closely for signs of a leftward tack away from the Democratic Party ’ s strategy .
Steyer , the San Francisco hedge fund billionaire trying to raise money for a planned $ 100-million midterm spending spree on behalf of environmentally minded candidates , is hosting a session called “ Putting Climate Change at the Forefront of American Politics , ” and is expected to hold one-on-one meetings to solicit checks from interested DA partners .
And the conference will mark the beginning of a new DA leadership regime that is replacing the Obama and Clinton loyalists who had been running the organization .
“ I anticipate the Democracy Alliance becoming both more progressive and more aggressive in the coming years , ” said Erica Payne , who helped found the club , and now runs the Agenda Project , a progressive communications nonprofit . “ That will disturb centrist Democrats , but it will be healthy and productive for the country . They need to be challenged on these things . ”
New DA President Gara LaMarche , who comes from the ranks of liberal philanthropy , is regarded as more independent from the Democratic Party than his predecessor Kelly Craighead . A former Clinton White House staffer and longtime Hillary Clinton assistant , she had helped raise money for Obama and Democratic super PACs closely linked to party leaders .
And in June , the board is expected to elect a new chair to replace Rob McKay , an heir to a Taco Bell fortune who has been chair since 2006 . McKay , an early Obama supporter , sat on the board of Priorities USA , the super PAC that boosted Obama ’ s 2012 reelection campaign and this year switched its allegiances to Clinton in advance of a hoped-for 2016 presidential campaign .
National Education Association executive John Stocks , is among the leading candidates to replace McKay , DA sources say , and would be the group ’ s first chair who is not a major donor and who hails from organized labor .
Stocks and McKay did not respond to requests for comment , while LaMarche rejected the idea that the DA is turning sharply left , let alone that it intends to pull the Democratic Party in that direction . Rather , he wants to help the group be a place for donors to work things out privately .
“ Our contribution to the debate about the direction of the Democratic Party post-Obama is more to be a forum where those discussions can take place than an interest group pushing a certain set of positions , ” he said . “ It ’ s about having more focus and impact and asking ourselves about where the accumulated dollars of these progressive donors will be best spent in the coming years . ”
He added , “ With respect to electoral politics at the presidential level , the DA has to be like Switzerland . ”
LaMarche worked as an official at the Open Society Foundations , which were founded by leading DA donor George Soros , and then at the Atlantic Philanthropies . Under his leadership , the DA has recruited 10 new partners this year after years of stagnant or declining membership .
Payne called LaMarche “ a visionary leader with enormous intellectual and institutional stature , not to mention deep relationships with very serious money people. ” Citing income inequality , Wall Street reform and climate change as areas in which DA partners want Democrats to be more aggressive , Payne suggested they would rebel against Clinton if she tapped the same officials who shaped economic policy in her husband ’ s administration and then again in Obama ’ s .
“ A lot of this is about whether Bob Rubin and Larry Summers will control the economic policies of the Democratic Party or whether leaders more like Elizabeth Warren will set the agenda , ” Payne said . “ Democracy Alliance members , broadly speaking , are not Rubinites . ”
The group suffered from the perception that it put its thumb on the scale for Obama during his bitter battle with Clinton in the 2008 Democratic primary , when a few DA donors quietly steered big sums to pre-super PAC outside groups supporting Obama . Some of Clinton ’ s loyalists left the group in disgust .
Now , many leading players in the DA are aligned behind Clinton , including Houston trial lawyers Steve and Amber Mostyn , billionaire financier George Soros , as well as David Brock and Harold Ickes , the founders of Media Matters and Catalist , respectively .
But there are others who are considered likely to support a liberal alternative like Warren . Despite insisting she won ’ t run , the Massachusetts senator continues to generate 2016 interest from liberals , and was lobbied to reconsider by some DA partners when she attended the group ’ s November meeting at Washington ’ s Mandarin Oriental hotel . After Warren firmly rejected their entreaties , the DA members began discussing other liberal alternatives , according to a source with knowledge of the Mandarin meeting . The Progressive Change Campaign Committee , which helped coax Warren into running for the Senate in 2012 and then boosting her campaign , and now is working to raise her profile in2016 presidential primary states , was recently added to a DA roster of suggested grantees . And health care tech entrepreneur Paul Egerman , who was Warren ’ s national finance director , last year became the DA ’ s treasurer .
As the 2012 Republican presidential primary demonstrated in stark terms , recent federal court cases including the 2010 Citizens United decision have created a landscape in which a single megadonor or small group thereof can upend a primary by spending huge sums to try secure a nomination for their favored candidate .
The DA was formed in 2005 partly to try steer big liberal money away from elections . Founding donors including Soros , McKay and insurance magnate Peter Lewis ( who died in November and will be honored in Chicago ) were somewhat disillusioned after donating the lion ’ s share of the $ 200 million spent by outside groups trying to defeat President George W. Bush the preceding year , and their goal was to use the DA to channel cash into think tanks and advocacy groups intended to help liberals win the long-term war of ideas rather than any given election .
The DA in recent years has reintegrated political spending outfits into its portfolio , including recommending donations to Democratic super PACs run by allies of Obama , Reid and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi .

Some of the country’s biggest Democratic donors — including Tom Steyer and Jonathan Soros — are huddling behind closed doors beginning Sunday in Chicago with union bigwigs and progressive superstars like Bill de Blasio to plan how to pull their party — and the country — to the left.

The setting is the annual spring meeting of the Democracy Alliance, a secretive club of wealthy liberals that’s the closest thing the left has to the vaunted Koch brothers’ political network.

Story Continued Below

The DA, as the liberal group is known to insiders, is increasing its ranks of rich donors for the first time in years and is gearing up to spend huge sums on political data, voter registration, ground organizing and advertising to influence the 2014 midterms and 2016 presidential elections. Potentially more significant, the groups’ donors also could play an important role in determining whether the post-Barack Obama Democratic Party embraces the rising tide of progressive populism or hews to a more cautious, centrist course — in other words, whether the Hillary Clinton wing or Elizabeth Warren wing will seize the reins.

The Spring Investment Conference will feature a number of Clinton allies and others associated with the centrist wing — including Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Kentucky Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes and Obama senior adviser Valerie Jarrett. But the conference — which kicks off Sunday night at a Ritz Carlton ballroom with a dinner keynoted by de Blasio — is also seen as a coming out party of sorts for the group’s progressives, who have expressed some measure of dissatisfaction with what they see as a level of timidity on their pet issues from the Obama White House.

According to a conference agenda obtained by POLITICO, panels will focus on elevating progressive issues like income inequality, climate change, drug reform, gun control, abortion rights and the death penalty.

It’s not all serious business, though. Social events include a wine party featuring selections from wineries owned by DA donors, a private curator-led tour of the Art Institute of Chicago and a performance by “The Daily Show” co-creator Lizz Winstead, who the agenda says will deploy her “comedic genius” to take a “light-hearted look at the conservative Right and the decay of the Fourth Estate.”

DA conferences are typically kept hush-hush, with locations tightly held, press barred from the sessions and participants prohibited from discussing the proceedings.

Invitations are coveted by all manner of Democrats. Several representatives from Obama’s orbit are expected at the Ritz, including White House Political Director David Simas and campaign adman Larry Grisolano. They’re participating in a panel on winning health care strategies in state races, while Organizing for Action, the nonprofit group formed from the remnants of Obama’s campaign to push his second-term agenda, is hosting donors for an open house at its headquarters. And former Obama political guru David Axelrod is slated to deliver a speech titled “Reflections on a Career in Journalism, Politics, and the Obama Journey.”

The courting of rich Democrats in Chicago comes as some of the party’s top names continue a discordant character assault on major conservative donors as eroding the very fabric of American democracy. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has repeatedly blasted the billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch as “un-American” and accused them of “actually trying to buy the country.”

Democracy Alliance partners, as the group calls its members, pay annual dues of $30,000 and are required to contribute a total of at least $200,000 a year to recommended groups. Since its inception in 2005, the DA has steered upward of $500 million to a range of groups, including pillars of the political left such as the conservative media watchdog Media Matters, the policy advocacy outfit Center for American Progress and the data firm Catalist — all of which are run by Clinton allies.

While those groups will be represented in Chicago, DA insiders and observers are watching the conference closely for signs of a leftward tack away from the Democratic Party’s strategy.

Steyer, the San Francisco hedge fund billionaire trying to raise money for a planned $100-million midterm spending spree on behalf of environmentally minded candidates, is hosting a session called “Putting Climate Change at the Forefront of American Politics,” and is expected to hold one-on-one meetings to solicit checks from interested DA partners.

And the conference will mark the beginning of a new DA leadership regime that is replacing the Obama and Clinton loyalists who had been running the organization.

“I anticipate the Democracy Alliance becoming both more progressive and more aggressive in the coming years,” said Erica Payne, who helped found the club, and now runs the Agenda Project, a progressive communications nonprofit. “That will disturb centrist Democrats, but it will be healthy and productive for the country. They need to be challenged on these things.”

New DA President Gara LaMarche, who comes from the ranks of liberal philanthropy, is regarded as more independent from the Democratic Party than his predecessor Kelly Craighead. A former Clinton White House staffer and longtime Hillary Clinton assistant, she had helped raise money for Obama and Democratic super PACs closely linked to party leaders.

And in June, the board is expected to elect a new chair to replace Rob McKay, an heir to a Taco Bell fortune who has been chair since 2006. McKay, an early Obama supporter, sat on the board of Priorities USA, the super PAC that boosted Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign and this year switched its allegiances to Clinton in advance of a hoped-for 2016 presidential campaign.

National Education Association executive John Stocks, is among the leading candidates to replace McKay, DA sources say, and would be the group’s first chair who is not a major donor and who hails from organized labor.

Stocks and McKay did not respond to requests for comment, while LaMarche rejected the idea that the DA is turning sharply left, let alone that it intends to pull the Democratic Party in that direction. Rather, he wants to help the group be a place for donors to work things out privately.

“Our contribution to the debate about the direction of the Democratic Party post-Obama is more to be a forum where those discussions can take place than an interest group pushing a certain set of positions,” he said. “It’s about having more focus and impact and asking ourselves about where the accumulated dollars of these progressive donors will be best spent in the coming years.”

He added, “With respect to electoral politics at the presidential level, the DA has to be like Switzerland.”

( WATCH: POLITICO's Driving the Day)

LaMarche worked as an official at the Open Society Foundations, which were founded by leading DA donor George Soros, and then at the Atlantic Philanthropies. Under his leadership, the DA has recruited 10 new partners this year after years of stagnant or declining membership.

Payne called LaMarche “a visionary leader with enormous intellectual and institutional stature, not to mention deep relationships with very serious money people.” Citing income inequality, Wall Street reform and climate change as areas in which DA partners want Democrats to be more aggressive, Payne suggested they would rebel against Clinton if she tapped the same officials who shaped economic policy in her husband’s administration and then again in Obama’s.

“A lot of this is about whether Bob Rubin and Larry Summers will control the economic policies of the Democratic Party or whether leaders more like Elizabeth Warren will set the agenda,” Payne said. “Democracy Alliance members, broadly speaking, are not Rubinites.”

The group suffered from the perception that it put its thumb on the scale for Obama during his bitter battle with Clinton in the 2008 Democratic primary, when a few DA donors quietly steered big sums to pre-super PAC outside groups supporting Obama. Some of Clinton’s loyalists left the group in disgust.

Now, many leading players in the DA are aligned behind Clinton, including Houston trial lawyers Steve and Amber Mostyn, billionaire financier George Soros, as well as David Brock and Harold Ickes, the founders of Media Matters and Catalist, respectively.

But there are others who are considered likely to support a liberal alternative like Warren. Despite insisting she won’t run, the Massachusetts senator continues to generate 2016 interest from liberals, and was lobbied to reconsider by some DA partners when she attended the group’s November meeting at Washington’s Mandarin Oriental hotel. After Warren firmly rejected their entreaties, the DA members began discussing other liberal alternatives, according to a source with knowledge of the Mandarin meeting. The Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which helped coax Warren into running for the Senate in 2012 and then boosting her campaign, and now is working to raise her profile in2016 presidential primary states, was recently added to a DA roster of suggested grantees. And health care tech entrepreneur Paul Egerman, who was Warren’s national finance director, last year became the DA’s treasurer.

As the 2012 Republican presidential primary demonstrated in stark terms, recent federal court cases including the 2010 Citizens United decision have created a landscape in which a single megadonor or small group thereof can upend a primary by spending huge sums to try secure a nomination for their favored candidate.

The DA was formed in 2005 partly to try steer big liberal money away from elections. Founding donors including Soros, McKay and insurance magnate Peter Lewis (who died in November and will be honored in Chicago) were somewhat disillusioned after donating the lion’s share of the $200 million spent by outside groups trying to defeat President George W. Bush the preceding year, and their goal was to use the DA to channel cash into think tanks and advocacy groups intended to help liberals win the long-term war of ideas rather than any given election.

The DA in recent years has reintegrated political spending outfits into its portfolio, including recommending donations to Democratic super PACs run by allies of Obama, Reid and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.

LaMarche acknowledged “there is a degree of irony, obviously” in liberal participation in big money politics while decrying it. But, he said “most progressives live with that irony by not wanting to unilaterally disarm in the system that we have. They have to live in the system that we have, and try to win in the system that we have, while at the same time putting a lot of energy into trying to change that system.”

Steel said among the party's goals is winning back the four congressional seats it lost in November in the traditional GOP stronghold of Orange County, just south of Los Angeles.

But it won't be easy. Polls show Trump remains deeply unpopular in California. A Quinnipiac University poll released in February showed only a 28% job-approval rating across the state for Trump. Having won seven seats in the midterm election, Democrats hold a 46 to seven advantage in congressional seats from California.

As of February, Democrats held an almost two-to-one voter registration advantage over Republicans. Since 2011, the Republican percentage of the vote has slipped from 30.9% to 23.6%, according to the California Secretary of State's office.

""They are becoming an endangered species,"" said Susan Estrich, a political science professor at the University of Southern California.

She said there is no getting around Trump's unpopularity.

""There's probably no state in the country that likes Trump least,"" Estrich said.

What can you do to help my campaign ? he asked , according to people familiar with the meeting .
Mr. Pecker , chief executive of American Media Inc. , offered to use his National Enquirer tabloid to buy the silence of women if they tried to publicize alleged sexual encounters with Mr. Trump .
Less than a year later , Mr. Trump asked Mr. Pecker to quash the story of a former Playboy model who said they ’ d had an affair . Mr. Pecker ’ s company soon paid $ 150,000 to the model , Karen McDougal , to keep her from speaking publicly about it . Mr. Trump later thanked Mr. Pecker for the assistance .
The Trump Tower meeting and its aftermath are among several previously unreported instances in which Mr. Trump intervened directly to suppress stories about his alleged sexual encounters with women , according to interviews with three dozen people who have direct knowledge of the events or who have been briefed on them , as well as court papers , corporate records and other documents .
While President Trump publicly fought with women leading up to the 2016 election , in private he directed schemes to silence their stories of two alleged affairs . Here ’ s a timeline of Trump ’ s personal involvement .
Taken together , the accounts refute a two-year pattern of denials by Mr. Trump , his legal team and his advisers that he was involved in payoffs to Ms. McDougal and a former adult-film star . They also raise the possibility that the president of the United States violated federal campaign-finance laws .
The Wall Street Journal found that Mr. Trump was involved in or briefed on nearly every step of the agreements . He directed deals in phone calls and meetings with his self-described fixer , Michael Cohen , and others . The U.S. attorney ’ s office in Manhattan has gathered evidence of Mr. Trump ’ s participation in the transactions .
On Thursday , the White House referred questions about Mr. Trump ’ s involvement in the hush deals to the president ’ s outside counsel Jay Sekulow , who declined to comment .
In an Oct. 23 interview with the Journal , Mr. Trump declined to address whether he had ever discussed the payments with Mr. Cohen during the campaign .
“ Nobody cares about that , ” he said . He described Mr. Cohen as a “ public-relations person ” who “ represented me on very small things . ”
Mr. Cohen , who left the Trump Organization to serve as the president ’ s personal attorney in early 2017 , and other aides denied Mr. Trump played any role in the two hush-money deals when they were first reported in the Journal .
Federal prosecutors in Manhattan came to believe otherwise . In August , they outlined Mr. Trump ’ s role—without specifically naming him—in a roughly 80-page draft federal indictment they had been preparing to file against Mr. Cohen .
When Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty that month to campaign-finance violations , prosecutors filed a 22-page charging document asserting that Mr. Cohen “ coordinated with one or more members of the campaign , including through meetings and phone calls , about the fact , nature , and timing of the payments . ”
The unnamed campaign member or members referred to Mr. Trump , according to people familiar with the document .
The revelations about Mr. Trump ’ s involvement in the hush-money deals come as special counsel Robert Mueller continues his probe into Russian electoral interference , and as a newly elected Democratic majority in the House of Representatives has signaled its intention to investigate the Trump administration when it takes power . Manhattan federal prosecutors who investigated Mr. Cohen are now examining business dealings by the Trump Organization .
Mr. Cohen , who implicated the president in his crimes when he pleaded guilty in August , has met with investigators for Mr. Mueller and with federal prosecutors in New York , seeking to provide information that could mitigate his punishment . His sentencing hearing is set for Dec. 12 .
He told federal prosecutors he conferred with Mr. Trump in the weeks before the 2016 election about paying Stephanie Clifford , the former adult-film star known professionally as Stormy Daniels , to keep quiet about her allegations of a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump . He told them that Mr. Trump urged him to “ get it done . ”
Mr. Cohen has also described to prosecutors his discussions with Mr. Trump and a Trump Organization executive about how to pay Ms. Clifford without leaving the candidate ’ s fingerprints on the deal .
Mr. Trump ’ s involvement in the payments , by itself , wouldn ’ t mean he is guilty of federal crimes , according to Richard Hasen , a law professor at University of California , Irvine , who specializes in election law . A criminal conviction would require proof Mr. Trump willfully skirted legal prohibitions on contributions from companies or from individuals in excess of $ 2,700 , he said .
When the Justice Department accused John Edwards , a former senator from North Carolina , of using illegal campaign contributions to conceal an affair during his 2008 presidential run , he argued the money was meant to hide his mistress from his wife , not to influence the election . A jury acquitted him of one charge and deadlocked on the rest .
Mr. Trump was leading in most polls for the Republican presidential nomination in the summer of 2015 after announcing his candidacy for president . His past behavior with women—flings with models and divorces that played out in the New York tabloids—caused concern among his advisers .
Mr. Pecker could help manage bad press . The men ’ s relationship dated to the 1990s , when Mr. Pecker ’ s former employer , Hachette Filipacchi Magazines , put out “ Trump Style , ” a quarterly magazine for guests at Trump properties .
When Mr. Pecker took over as chief executive of American Media in the late 1990s , he imposed a moratorium on negative stories about Mr. Trump , who was known among Enquirer staff as an “ F.O.P. , ” or Friend of Pecker .
Mr. Pecker ’ s August 2015 Trump Tower meeting was arranged by Mr. Cohen . The media executive promised Mr. Trump he would flag to Mr. Cohen any negative stories about women that came to the Enquirer ’ s attention .
In May 2016 , Ms. McDougal , the 1998 Playmate of the year , began to consider telling her story of a nearly yearlong affair with Mr. Trump . She believed the story would come out regardless , after another former Playboy model posted a tweet alluding to a relationship between the two .
Ms. McDougal retained Keith Davidson , a Los Angeles lawyer specializing in representing women who ’ d had affairs with celebrities . Mr. Davidson reached out to Dylan Howard , American Media ’ s New York-based chief content officer , to gauge the company ’ s interest in buying Ms. McDougal ’ s story .
Messrs. Pecker and Howard alerted Mr. Cohen , who in turn warned Mr. Trump , by then the presumptive Republican presidential nominee , who in turn phoned Mr. Pecker for help .
On June 20 , 2016 , Mr. Howard flew to Los Angeles to meet Ms. McDougal at her lawyer ’ s office .
Mr. Howard spent hours interviewing Ms. McDougal , pressing her for every detail of the alleged affair . Ms. McDougal seemed reluctant to go public with her story .
“ I don ’ t want to be the next Monica Lewinsky , ” Ms. McDougal said , referring to the young White House intern who was vilified after her affair with President Bill Clinton became public . Mr. Howard told her that without documents corroborating her story , it wouldn ’ t be worth more than $ 15,000 .
When Mr. Howard finished interviewing Ms. McDougal that day , he and Mr. Pecker got on a three-way call with Mr. Cohen to discuss what she had said . They noted she had produced no proof of an affair with Mr. Trump .
Mr. Howard told Mr. Davidson that Ms. McDougal should get back in touch if she found any evidence of the alleged affair .
After the meeting , Messrs. Pecker and Howard learned Ms. McDougal had also been meeting with investigative reporters at ABC News about sharing her story in a televised interview .
Mr. Cohen updated Mr. Trump on developments throughout . The ABC talks prompted American Media to offer to buy Ms. McDougal ’ s story for $ 150,000 in early August .
The contract gave the publisher the exclusive rights to her story , and guaranteed Ms. McDougal and American Media two magazine covers on which she would appear as a model . As part of the deal , American Media had the option of publishing health and fitness columns under Ms. McDougal ’ s name .
In a Skype call , Mr. Howard told Ms. McDougal the covers and columns would help resuscitate her modeling career .
Mr. Pecker researched campaign-finance laws before entering into the McDougal deal . The question was : Would American Media ’ s payment amount to an illegal campaign contribution to Mr. Trump ? Corporations are barred under federal law from giving directly to candidates , either in cash or in-kind contributions .
After speaking with an election-law specialist , Mr. Pecker concluded the company ’ s payment to Ms. McDougal wouldn ’ t violate the law , because the magazine covers and health columns gave him a business justification for the deal .
The contract had an effective date of Aug. 5 , 2016 . Ms. McDougal signed it the following day .
Mr. Cohen assured Mr. Pecker that Mr. Trump would reimburse the publisher , and they began to devise a repayment plan at the end of that month .
Concerned Mr. Pecker might leave American Media , Mr. Cohen wanted to buy other materials the company had gathered on Mr. Trump over the years , including source files and tips . In a meeting at the Trump Organization offices in early September , Mr. Cohen told Mr. Trump of his plan .
Mr. Cohen , who complained to associates about Mr. Trump ’ s frugality , was also worried his boss would balk at reimbursing Mr. Pecker . He secretly recorded Mr. Trump discussing the deal .
“ Um , I need to open up a company for the transfer of all of that info regarding our friend , David , you know , so that—I ’ m going to do that right away , ” said Mr. Cohen , according to a copy of the audio file .
As Mr. Cohen explained his plans , Mr. Trump spoke over him : “ So , what are we gon na pay…One-fifty ? ” Mr. Trump asked . Mr. Cohen paused and replied , “ Yes . ”
Mr. Cohen said he would be getting “ all the stuff , ” meaning the other files on Mr. Trump he had been seeking . They discussed the uncertainty about what might become of the files if Mr. Pecker no longer ran American Media . “ Yeah , I was thinking about that , ” Mr. Trump said . “ Maybe he gets hit by a truck . ”
Messrs. Pecker and Cohen signed a contract for the transfer of the McDougal story in late September . Mr. Cohen set up a shell company in Delaware for the transaction on Sept. 30 .
The publisher would assign the rights to Ms. McDougal ’ s story to Mr. Cohen for $ 125,000—the value they put on Ms. McDougal ’ s agreement with American Media minus the magazine covers and fitness columns , the rights to which the publisher would retain .
Mr. Pecker called off the Trump-reimbursement deal in October 2016 on the advice of his lawyer . Accepting reimbursement from Mr. Trump , the executive worried , could undermine any argument that the McDougal payment was made for editorial and business reasons , rather than as an in-kind campaign contribution .
Mr. Pecker told Mr. Cohen to tear up the reimbursement agreement , but Mr. Cohen kept a copy . Federal agents found it in a search of Mr. Cohen ’ s office earlier this year .
As the McDougal deal came together , another woman was shopping her story of an alleged tryst with Mr. Trump .
Earlier in 2016 , an agent for Ms. Clifford , the adult-film actress , had approached Mr. Howard about selling her story of a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump . The agent , Gina Rodriguez , was seeking upward of $ 200,000 for the story , but Mr. Howard passed .
Ms. Clifford ’ s story—she said she had sex with Mr. Trump at a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe a decade earlier—had already been told in 2011 on a gossip blog , The Dirty . Mr. Howard reminded Ms. Rodriguez that Ms. Clifford had called the report “ bulls— ” when contacted five years earlier by entertainment channel E ! .
Ms. Clifford gained more leverage on Oct. 7 , when the Washington Post published previously unaired footage from a 2005 appearance by Mr. Trump on NBC ’ s “ Access Hollywood. ” Mr. Trump could be heard on the video chatting with host Billy Bush about groping women .
After the tape surfaced , nearly upending Mr. Trump ’ s campaign , Ms. Rodriguez reached out to Mr. Howard and told him Ms. Clifford was prepared to go public . Ms. Clifford , through her agent , was in preliminary talks with ABC ’ s “ Good Morning America . ”
Mr. Howard alerted Mr. Pecker , and they separately spoke to Mr. Cohen about Ms. Clifford . The Trump camp at the time was scrambling to contain fallout from the tape , as women came forward with stories of sexual misconduct by the candidate , all of which he denied .
Ms. Clifford had taken a polygraph test in 2011 , when another celebrity publication , Life & Style , was vetting her claims of a sexual encounter . When asked whether she had unprotected sex with Mr. Trump , she answered “ yes , ” and the examiner found no signs of deception .
Mr. Cohen had been able to kill that earlier story with a legal threat . Ms. Clifford and Ms. Rodriguez wouldn ’ t be intimidated this time .
Mr. Cohen asked American Media to buy Ms. Clifford ’ s story . Mr. Pecker refused on the grounds that he didn ’ t want his company to pay a porn star .
Messrs. Cohen and Trump would have to handle the payment themselves . Mr. Cohen told federal prosecutors he relayed the news to Mr. Trump in his Trump Tower office in the second week of October 2016 .
That is when Mr. Trump , smarting from the “ Access Hollywood ” tape , told Mr. Cohen to “ get it done , ” according to Mr. Cohen ’ s account to prosecutors .
Within days , Mr. Cohen and Mr. Davidson had negotiated a nondisclosure agreement for Ms. Clifford .
The money was slow in coming because Mr. Trump , Mr. Cohen and the longtime chief financial officer of the Trump Organization , Allen Weisselberg , couldn ’ t settle on a plan for getting it to Mr. Davidson without anyone being able to trace it back to Mr. Trump , according to Mr. Cohen ’ s account to prosecutors . Among the options they considered : routing the payment through a Trump-owned property , Mr. Cohen told prosecutors .
Mr. Cohen offered a suggestion : Why not have Mr. Weisselberg make the payment ? “ You ’ re the CFO , ” he told the longtime Trump aide , according to Mr. Cohen ’ s account to prosecutors . “ You pay this. ” Mr. Weisselberg said he couldn ’ t come up with the money .
Mary Mulligan , a lawyer for Mr. Weisselberg , said he had been “ fully cooperative ” with the investigation and declined to comment further . A person close to Mr. Weisselberg disputed the account Mr. Cohen gave to prosecutors .
Mr. Cohen had told Mr. Davidson to expect a $ 130,000 wire transfer by Oct. 14 , but missed the deadline , as well as an extension , prompting Ms. Clifford to walk away .
While Mr. Cohen considered a path forward , he offered excuses to Ms. Clifford ’ s camp . He told Mr. Davidson banks were closed for the Jewish holidays and he couldn ’ t reach Mr. Trump on the campaign trail . “ My guy is in five states today , ” Mr. Cohen said .
Mr. Davidson told Mr. Howard on Oct. 25 , 2016 , that Ms. Clifford would soon speak publicly . Mr. Howard texted Mr. Cohen that they needed to coordinate “ or it could look awfully bad for everyone . ”
In a tense three-way call on an encrypted app , Messrs. Pecker and Howard urged Mr. Cohen to complete the deal before Ms. Clifford disclosed the hush-money negotiations .
Out of options and time , Mr. Cohen decided to cover the payment himself . “ F— it , I ’ m just going to do it , ” he told Mr. Davidson in a phone call .
He drew down his home-equity line and transferred $ 130,000 to Mr. Davidson on Oct. 27 . Ms. Clifford signed a fresh nondisclosure agreement the next day .
That month , a news site called “ The Smoking Gun ” published an account of Ms. Clifford ’ s alleged sexual encounter with Mr. Trump . Then-Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus and Trump campaign chief Steve Bannon confronted the candidate . Mr. Trump told them the encounter never happened .
Four days before the 2016 election , The Wall Street Journal revealed the $ 150,000 payment to Ms. McDougal by American Media . The company said at the time Ms. McDougal had been paid for magazine covers and fitness columns and denied buying her story to protect Mr. Trump .
The Trump campaign professed ignorance . “ We have no knowledge of any of this , ” Hope Hicks , Mr. Trump ’ s spokeswoman , said of the McDougal deal . Ms. Hicks , who discussed the matter with Mr. Trump before issuing the comment , was relaying what she had been told , according to people familiar with the conversation . She also denied Mr. Trump had sex with Ms. McDougal .
As Mr. Trump headed to victory on Nov. 8 , Mr. Howard joined Mr. Cohen at the candidate ’ s election night celebration at the New York Hilton .
Later that month , after Mr. Trump ’ s election win , Mr. Cohen met with Mr. Weisselberg to discuss reimbursement for the payment to Ms. Clifford , Mr. Cohen has told federal prosecutors .
While Mr. Cohen waited , he asked Mr. Pecker to lobby Mr. Trump to pay him more money .
Mr. Pecker visited Trump Tower twice during the presidential transition . When he raised Mr. Cohen ’ s request during a meeting in the first week of December 2016 , Mr. Trump demurred , saying Mr. Cohen had plenty of money . During Mr. Pecker ’ s second visit , in January 2017 , Mr. Trump thanked him for suppressing the McDougal story .
It would turn out to be a costly deal for Mr. Trump .
Had he just paid the ex-adult film star himself , Mr. Trump would have been out of pocket $ 130,000 . Instead , Mr. Weisselberg authorized a reimbursement of twice that much , characterized in Mr. Trump ’ s records as legal fees , to cover the income tax hit Mr. Cohen would take . He also added a $ 60,000 bonus . Mr. Cohen received the money in monthly installments of $ 35,000 .
In the first year of Mr. Trump ’ s presidency , American Media continued to feature him on the Enquirer cover . In July 2017 , Mr. Trump hosted Messrs. Pecker and Howard at the White House for dinner , an Oval Office visit and a private tour of the Lincoln Bedroom led by the president .
After the Journal reported on the payment to Ms. Clifford in January 2018 , the relationships between Messrs. Trump , Cohen and Pecker began to fracture .
Ms. Clifford , initially willing to keep quiet , began to seek more exposure and threatened to break the agreement after Mr. Cohen acknowledged paying her in a February statement to the news media . Mr. Trump instructed Mr. Cohen to coordinate with his son Eric Trump to silence Ms. Clifford in arbitration . It didn ’ t work ; Ms. Clifford ignored the arbitrator ’ s restraining order .
Mr. Cohen continued to insist he had done the deal with Ms. Clifford on his own , while Mr. Trump said he knew nothing about it when talking to reporters on Air Force One on April 5 .
“ You ’ ll have to ask Michael Cohen , ” the president said . “ Michael is my attorney . ”
Days later , on April 9 , the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided Mr. Cohen ’ s office , apartment and hotel room . Agents approached Messrs. Pecker and Howard . Federal prosecutors subpoenaed American Media and the Trump Organization , among others .
As Mr. Trump continued to distance himself from Mr. Cohen and the payment , American Media turned on Mr. Cohen , with a National Enquirer cover featuring the headline , “ Trump Fixer ’ s Secrets & Lies. ” Mr. Cohen learned he had been let go as Mr. Trump ’ s personal attorney when he saw it on television .
Both Messrs. Cohen and Pecker began seeking to minimize their exposure . Mr. Pecker , granted immunity for his grand jury testimony , told investigators about Mr. Trump ’ s involvement in the McDougal deal .
Three years after Mr. Pecker promised to work with Mr. Cohen to help Mr. Trump , the deals they made have unraveled . Ms. McDougal and Ms. Clifford have both been let out of their hush agreements after filing lawsuits .","As a presidential candidate in August 2015, Donald Trump huddled with a longtime friend, media executive David Pecker, in his cluttered 26th floor Trump Tower office and made a request.

What can you do to help my campaign? he asked, according to people familiar with the meeting.

Mr. Pecker, chief executive of American Media Inc., offered to use his National Enquirer tabloid to buy the silence of women if they tried to publicize alleged sexual encounters with Mr. Trump.

They also raise the possibility that the president of the United States violated federal campaign-finance laws.

The Wall Street Journal found that Mr. Trump was involved in or briefed on nearly every step of the agreements. He directed deals in phone calls and meetings with his self-described fixer, Michael Cohen, and others. The U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan has gathered evidence of Mr. Trump’s participation in the transactions.

The revelations about Mr. Trump’s involvement in the hush-money deals come as special counsel Robert Mueller continues his probe into Russian electoral interference, and as a newly elected Democratic majority in the House of Representatives has signaled its intention to investigate the Trump administration when it takes power. Manhattan federal prosecutors who investigated Mr. Cohen are now examining business dealings by the Trump Organization.

Mr. Cohen, who implicated the president in his crimes when he pleaded guilty in August, has met with investigators for Mr. Mueller and with federal prosecutors in New York, seeking to provide information that could mitigate his punishment. His sentencing hearing is set for Dec. 12.

He told federal prosecutors he conferred with Mr. Trump in the weeks before the 2016 election about paying Stephanie Clifford, the former adult-film star known professionally as Stormy Daniels, to keep quiet about her allegations of a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. He told them that Mr. Trump urged him to “get it done.”

Mr. Cohen has also described to prosecutors his discussions with Mr. Trump and a Trump Organization executive about how to pay Ms. Clifford without leaving the candidate’s fingerprints on the deal.

Mr. Trump’s involvement in the payments, by itself, wouldn’t mean he is guilty of federal crimes, according to Richard Hasen, a law professor at University of California, Irvine, who specializes in election law. A criminal conviction would require proof Mr. Trump willfully skirted legal prohibitions on contributions from companies or from individuals in excess of $2,700, he said.

When the Justice Department accused John Edwards, a former senator from North Carolina, of using illegal campaign contributions to conceal an affair during his 2008 presidential run, he argued the money was meant to hide his mistress from his wife, not to influence the election. A jury acquitted him of one charge and deadlocked on the rest.

Managing bad press

Mr. Trump was leading in most polls for the Republican presidential nomination in the summer of 2015 after announcing his candidacy for president. His past behavior with women—flings with models and divorces that played out in the New York tabloids—caused concern among his advisers.

Mr. Pecker could help manage bad press. The men’s relationship dated to the 1990s, when Mr. Pecker’s former employer, Hachette Filipacchi Magazines, put out “Trump Style,” a quarterly magazine for guests at Trump properties.

He was like a public-relations person.”

When Mr. Pecker took over as chief executive of American Media in the late 1990s, he imposed a moratorium on negative stories about Mr. Trump, who was known among Enquirer staff as an “F.O.P.,” or Friend of Pecker.

Mr. Pecker’s August 2015 Trump Tower meeting was arranged by Mr. Cohen. The media executive promised Mr. Trump he would flag to Mr. Cohen any negative stories about women that came to the Enquirer’s attention.

In May 2016, Ms. McDougal, the 1998 Playmate of the year, began to consider telling her story of a nearly yearlong affair with Mr. Trump. She believed the story would come out regardless, after another former Playboy model posted a tweet alluding to a relationship between the two.

Ms. McDougal retained Keith Davidson, a Los Angeles lawyer specializing in representing women who’d had affairs with celebrities. Mr. Davidson reached out to Dylan Howard, American Media’s New York-based chief content officer, to gauge the company’s interest in buying Ms. McDougal’s story.

Messrs. Pecker and Howard alerted Mr. Cohen, who in turn warned Mr. Trump, by then the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, who in turn phoned Mr. Pecker for help.

On June 20, 2016, Mr. Howard flew to Los Angeles to meet Ms. McDougal at her lawyer’s office.

Mr. Howard spent hours interviewing Ms. McDougal, pressing her for every detail of the alleged affair. Ms. McDougal seemed reluctant to go public with her story.

“I don’t want to be the next Monica Lewinsky,” Ms. McDougal said, referring to the young White House intern who was vilified after her affair with President Bill Clinton became public. Mr. Howard told her that without documents corroborating her story, it wouldn’t be worth more than $15,000.

When Mr. Howard finished interviewing Ms. McDougal that day, he and Mr. Pecker got on a three-way call with Mr. Cohen to discuss what she had said. They noted she had produced no proof of an affair with Mr. Trump.

He was like a public-relations person.”

Mr. Howard told Mr. Davidson that Ms. McDougal should get back in touch if she found any evidence of the alleged affair.

After the meeting, Messrs. Pecker and Howard learned Ms. McDougal had also been meeting with investigative reporters at ABC News about sharing her story in a televised interview.

Mr. Cohen updated Mr. Trump on developments throughout. The ABC talks prompted American Media to offer to buy Ms. McDougal’s story for $150,000 in early August.

The contract gave the publisher the exclusive rights to her story, and guaranteed Ms. McDougal and American Media two magazine covers on which she would appear as a model. As part of the deal, American Media had the option of publishing health and fitness columns under Ms. McDougal’s name.

In a Skype call, Mr. Howard told Ms. McDougal the covers and columns would help resuscitate her modeling career.

Mr. Pecker researched campaign-finance laws before entering into the McDougal deal. The question was: Would American Media’s payment amount to an illegal campaign contribution to Mr. Trump? Corporations are barred under federal law from giving directly to candidates, either in cash or in-kind contributions.

After speaking with an election-law specialist, Mr. Pecker concluded the company’s payment to Ms. McDougal wouldn’t violate the law, because the magazine covers and health columns gave him a business justification for the deal.

The contract had an effective date of Aug. 5, 2016. Ms. McDougal signed it the following day.

Mr. Cohen assured Mr. Pecker that Mr. Trump would reimburse the publisher, and they began to devise a repayment plan at the end of that month.

‘All the stuff’

Concerned Mr. Pecker might leave American Media, Mr. Cohen wanted to buy other materials the company had gathered on Mr. Trump over the years, including source files and tips. In a meeting at the Trump Organization offices in early September, Mr. Cohen told Mr. Trump of his plan.

Mr. Cohen, who complained to associates about Mr. Trump’s frugality, was also worried his boss would balk at reimbursing Mr. Pecker. He secretly recorded Mr. Trump discussing the deal.

“Um, I need to open up a company for the transfer of all of that info regarding our friend, David, you know, so that—I’m going to do that right away,” said Mr. Cohen, according to a copy of the audio file.

As Mr. Cohen explained his plans, Mr. Trump spoke over him: “So, what are we gonna pay…One-fifty?” Mr. Trump asked. Mr. Cohen paused and replied, “Yes.”

Mr. Cohen said he would be getting “all the stuff,” meaning the other files on Mr. Trump he had been seeking. They discussed the uncertainty about what might become of the files if Mr. Pecker no longer ran American Media. “Yeah, I was thinking about that,” Mr. Trump said. “Maybe he gets hit by a truck.”

Messrs. Pecker and Cohen signed a contract for the transfer of the McDougal story in late September. Mr. Cohen set up a shell company in Delaware for the transaction on Sept. 30.

The publisher would assign the rights to Ms. McDougal’s story to Mr. Cohen for $125,000—the value they put on Ms. McDougal’s agreement with American Media minus the magazine covers and fitness columns, the rights to which the publisher would retain.

Mr. Pecker called off the Trump-reimbursement deal in October 2016 on the advice of his lawyer. Accepting reimbursement from Mr. Trump, the executive worried, could undermine any argument that the McDougal payment was made for editorial and business reasons, rather than as an in-kind campaign contribution.

Mr. Pecker told Mr. Cohen to tear up the reimbursement agreement, but Mr. Cohen kept a copy. Federal agents found it in a search of Mr. Cohen’s office earlier this year.

Stormy surfaces

As the McDougal deal came together, another woman was shopping her story of an alleged tryst with Mr. Trump.

Earlier in 2016, an agent for Ms. Clifford, the adult-film actress, had approached Mr. Howard about selling her story of a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. The agent, Gina Rodriguez, was seeking upward of $200,000 for the story, but Mr. Howard passed.

Ms. Clifford’s story—she said she had sex with Mr. Trump at a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe a decade earlier—had already been told in 2011 on a gossip blog, The Dirty. Mr. Howard reminded Ms. Rodriguez that Ms. Clifford had called the report “bulls—” when contacted five years earlier by entertainment channel E!.

Ms. Clifford gained more leverage on Oct. 7, when the Washington Post published previously unaired footage from a 2005 appearance by Mr. Trump on NBC’s “Access Hollywood.” Mr. Trump could be heard on the video chatting with host Billy Bush about groping women.

After the tape surfaced, nearly upending Mr. Trump’s campaign, Ms. Rodriguez reached out to Mr. Howard and told him Ms. Clifford was prepared to go public. Ms. Clifford, through her agent, was in preliminary talks with ABC’s “Good Morning America.”

He was like a public-relations person.”

Mr. Howard alerted Mr. Pecker, and they separately spoke to Mr. Cohen about Ms. Clifford. The Trump camp at the time was scrambling to contain fallout from the tape, as women came forward with stories of sexual misconduct by the candidate, all of which he denied.

Ms. Clifford had taken a polygraph test in 2011, when another celebrity publication, Life & Style, was vetting her claims of a sexual encounter. When asked whether she had unprotected sex with Mr. Trump, she answered “yes,” and the examiner found no signs of deception.

Mr. Cohen had been able to kill that earlier story with a legal threat. Ms. Clifford and Ms. Rodriguez wouldn’t be intimidated this time.

Mr. Cohen asked American Media to buy Ms. Clifford’s story. Mr. Pecker refused on the grounds that he didn’t want his company to pay a porn star.

Messrs. Cohen and Trump would have to handle the payment themselves. Mr. Cohen told federal prosecutors he relayed the news to Mr. Trump in his Trump Tower office in the second week of October 2016.

That is when Mr. Trump, smarting from the “Access Hollywood” tape, told Mr. Cohen to “get it done,” according to Mr. Cohen’s account to prosecutors.

Within days, Mr. Cohen and Mr. Davidson had negotiated a nondisclosure agreement for Ms. Clifford.

The money was slow in coming because Mr. Trump, Mr. Cohen and the longtime chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, Allen Weisselberg, couldn’t settle on a plan for getting it to Mr. Davidson without anyone being able to trace it back to Mr. Trump, according to Mr. Cohen’s account to prosecutors. Among the options they considered: routing the payment through a Trump-owned property, Mr. Cohen told prosecutors.

Mr. Cohen offered a suggestion: Why not have Mr. Weisselberg make the payment? “You’re the CFO,” he told the longtime Trump aide, according to Mr. Cohen’s account to prosecutors. “You pay this.” Mr. Weisselberg said he couldn’t come up with the money.

Mary Mulligan, a lawyer for Mr. Weisselberg, said he had been “fully cooperative” with the investigation and declined to comment further. A person close to Mr. Weisselberg disputed the account Mr. Cohen gave to prosecutors.

Mr. Cohen had told Mr. Davidson to expect a $130,000 wire transfer by Oct. 14, but missed the deadline, as well as an extension, prompting Ms. Clifford to walk away.

While Mr. Cohen considered a path forward, he offered excuses to Ms. Clifford’s camp. He told Mr. Davidson banks were closed for the Jewish holidays and he couldn’t reach Mr. Trump on the campaign trail. “My guy is in five states today,” Mr. Cohen said.

Mr. Davidson told Mr. Howard on Oct. 25, 2016, that Ms. Clifford would soon speak publicly. Mr. Howard texted Mr. Cohen that they needed to coordinate “or it could look awfully bad for everyone.”

In a tense three-way call on an encrypted app, Messrs. Pecker and Howard urged Mr. Cohen to complete the deal before Ms. Clifford disclosed the hush-money negotiations.

Out of options and time, Mr. Cohen decided to cover the payment himself. “F— it, I’m just going to do it,” he told Mr. Davidson in a phone call.

He drew down his home-equity line and transferred $130,000 to Mr. Davidson on Oct. 27. Ms. Clifford signed a fresh nondisclosure agreement the next day.

That month, a news site called “The Smoking Gun” published an account of Ms. Clifford’s alleged sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. Then-Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus and Trump campaign chief Steve Bannon confronted the candidate. Mr. Trump told them the encounter never happened.

Four days before the 2016 election, The Wall Street Journal revealed the $150,000 payment to Ms. McDougal by American Media. The company said at the time Ms. McDougal had been paid for magazine covers and fitness columns and denied buying her story to protect Mr. Trump.

The Trump campaign professed ignorance. “We have no knowledge of any of this,” Hope Hicks, Mr. Trump’s spokeswoman, said of the McDougal deal. Ms. Hicks, who discussed the matter with Mr. Trump before issuing the comment, was relaying what she had been told, according to people familiar with the conversation. She also denied Mr. Trump had sex with Ms. McDougal.

As Mr. Trump headed to victory on Nov. 8, Mr. Howard joined Mr. Cohen at the candidate’s election night celebration at the New York Hilton.

Repaying Cohen

Later that month, after Mr. Trump’s election win, Mr. Cohen met with Mr. Weisselberg to discuss reimbursement for the payment to Ms. Clifford, Mr. Cohen has told federal prosecutors.

Michael had discretion to solve these.” —Rudy Giuliani Pete Marovich/Getty Images Donald Trump on what kind of work Michael Cohen did for him 2017 ’18 “Michael is my attorney.” “He represented me on very small things. He was like a public-relations person.”

While Mr. Cohen waited, he asked Mr. Pecker to lobby Mr. Trump to pay him more money.

Mr. Pecker visited Trump Tower twice during the presidential transition. When he raised Mr. Cohen’s request during a meeting in the first week of December 2016, Mr. Trump demurred, saying Mr. Cohen had plenty of money. During Mr. Pecker’s second visit, in January 2017, Mr. Trump thanked him for suppressing the McDougal story.

Mr. Weisselberg soon completed the reimbursement plan.

It would turn out to be a costly deal for Mr. Trump.

Had he just paid the ex-adult film star himself, Mr. Trump would have been out of pocket $130,000. Instead, Mr. Weisselberg authorized a reimbursement of twice that much, characterized in Mr. Trump’s records as legal fees, to cover the income tax hit Mr. Cohen would take. He also added a $60,000 bonus. Mr. Cohen received the money in monthly installments of $35,000.

In the first year of Mr. Trump’s presidency, American Media continued to feature him on the Enquirer cover. In July 2017, Mr. Trump hosted Messrs. Pecker and Howard at the White House for dinner, an Oval Office visit and a private tour of the Lincoln Bedroom led by the president.

After the Journal reported on the payment to Ms. Clifford in January 2018, the relationships between Messrs. Trump, Cohen and Pecker began to fracture.

Ms. Clifford, initially willing to keep quiet, began to seek more exposure and threatened to break the agreement after Mr. Cohen acknowledged paying her in a February statement to the news media. Mr. Trump instructed Mr. Cohen to coordinate with his son Eric Trump to silence Ms. Clifford in arbitration. It didn’t work; Ms. Clifford ignored the arbitrator’s restraining order.

Mr. Cohen continued to insist he had done the deal with Ms. Clifford on his own, while Mr. Trump said he knew nothing about it when talking to reporters on Air Force One on April 5.

“You’ll have to ask Michael Cohen,” the president said. “Michael is my attorney.”

Days later, on April 9, the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided Mr. Cohen’s office, apartment and hotel room. Agents approached Messrs. Pecker and Howard. Federal prosecutors subpoenaed American Media and the Trump Organization, among others.

He was like a public-relations person.”

As Mr. Trump continued to distance himself from Mr. Cohen and the payment, American Media turned on Mr. Cohen, with a National Enquirer cover featuring the headline, “Trump Fixer’s Secrets & Lies.” Mr. Cohen learned he had been let go as Mr. Trump’s personal attorney when he saw it on television.

Both Messrs. Cohen and Pecker began seeking to minimize their exposure. Mr. Pecker, granted immunity for his grand jury testimony, told investigators about Mr. Trump’s involvement in the McDougal deal.

Three years after Mr. Pecker promised to work with Mr. Cohen to help Mr. Trump, the deals they made have unraveled. Ms. McDougal and Ms. Clifford have both been let out of their hush agreements after filing lawsuits.

The three men no longer speak to one another.

campaign_finance,Newsmax,2,https://www.newsmax.com/politics/trump-giuliani-ukraine-arrest/2019/10/10/id/936494/,Feds Arrest 2 Florida Businessmen Linked to Giuliani on Campaign-Finance Violations,2019-10-10,Jason Devaney,"Two Florida businessmen tied to President Donald Trump 's lawyer and the Ukraine impeachment investigation were charged Thursday with federal campaign finance violations .
The charges relate to a $ 325,000 donation to a group supporting Trump 's reelection .
Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman , associates of Rudy Giuliani , were arrested Wednesday trying to board an international flight with one-way tickets at Dulles International Airport in Virginia , according to Geoffrey Berman , the U.S. attorney in Manhattan . No destination was disclosed .
Parnas and Fruman were arrested on a four-count indictment that includes charges of conspiracy , making false statements to the Federal Election Commission and falsification of records . The men had key roles in Giuliani 's efforts to launch a Ukrainian corruption investigation against Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden and his son Hunter .
The indictments mark the first criminal charges related to the Ukraine controversy . While they do not suggest wrongdoing by the president , they raise additional questions about how those close to Trump and Giuliani sought to use their influence .
Trump has dismissed the impeachment inquiry as baseless and politically motivated . As he was leaving the White House for a political rally in Minneapolis , Trump said he did n't know Parnas or Fruman and had n't spoken with Giuliani about them .
Giuliani said he could n't comment and that he did n't represent the men in campaign finance matters .
Records show that Parnas and Fruman used wire transfers from a corporate entity to make the $ 325,000 donation to the America First Action committee in May 2018 . But wire transfer records that became public through a lawsuit show that the corporate entity reported as making the transaction was not the source of the money .
The big donation to the Trump-allied PAC was part of a flurry of political spending tied to Parnas and Fruman , with at least $ 478,000 in donations flowing to GOP campaigns and PACs in little more than two months .
The money enabled the relatively unknown entrepreneurs to quickly gain access to the highest levels of the Republican Party , including meetings with Trump at the White House and Mar-a-Lago in Florida .
Prosecutors also allege that Parnas urged a congressman to seek the ouster of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine , at the behest of Ukrainian government officials . That happened about the same time that Parnas and Fruman committed to raising more than $ 20,000 for the politician .
Parnas and Fruman appeared in court Thursday and were ordered to remain jailed as a bail package was worked out . They are due in court in New York next week .

The charges relate to a $325,000 donation to a group supporting Trump's reelection.

Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, associates of Rudy Giuliani, were arrested Wednesday trying to board an international flight with one-way tickets at Dulles International Airport in Virginia, according to Geoffrey Berman, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan. No destination was disclosed.

Parnas and Fruman were arrested on a four-count indictment that includes charges of conspiracy, making false statements to the Federal Election Commission and falsification of records. The men had key roles in Giuliani's efforts to launch a Ukrainian corruption investigation against Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

The indictments mark the first criminal charges related to the Ukraine controversy. While they do not suggest wrongdoing by the president, they raise additional questions about how those close to Trump and Giuliani sought to use their influence.

Trump has dismissed the impeachment inquiry as baseless and politically motivated. As he was leaving the White House for a political rally in Minneapolis, Trump said he didn't know Parnas or Fruman and hadn't spoken with Giuliani about them.

""We have nothing to do with it,"" Trump said.

Giuliani said he couldn't comment and that he didn't represent the men in campaign finance matters.

Records show that Parnas and Fruman used wire transfers from a corporate entity to make the $325,000 donation to the America First Action committee in May 2018. But wire transfer records that became public through a lawsuit show that the corporate entity reported as making the transaction was not the source of the money.

The big donation to the Trump-allied PAC was part of a flurry of political spending tied to Parnas and Fruman, with at least $478,000 in donations flowing to GOP campaigns and PACs in little more than two months.

The money enabled the relatively unknown entrepreneurs to quickly gain access to the highest levels of the Republican Party, including meetings with Trump at the White House and Mar-a-Lago in Florida.

Prosecutors also allege that Parnas urged a congressman to seek the ouster of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, at the behest of Ukrainian government officials. That happened about the same time that Parnas and Fruman committed to raising more than $20,000 for the politician.

The congressman wasn't identified in court papers, but the donations match campaign finance reports for former Rep. Pete Sessions, a Texas Republican who lost his re-election bid in November. In May 2018, Parnas posted a photo of himself and his business partner David Correia with Sessions in his Capitol Hill office, with the caption ""Hard at work!!""

Parnas and Fruman appeared in court Thursday and were ordered to remain jailed as a bail package was worked out. They are due in court in New York next week. Kevin Downing, the lawyer who represented former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort on charges that he hid millions of dollars that he earned in Ukraine advising politicians there, was representing the men for their initial appearance and declined to comment.

Correia and Andrey Kukushkin, a Ukrainian-born U.S. citizen, were also charged in the case. A federal judge in San Francisco ordered Kukushkin held on Thursday pending a bail hearing to determine whether he is considered a flight risk.

Not so long ago — the administration of President George W. Bush — $1 million could get you elected to Congress. Now, four weeks from Election Day, Democrats say 60 of their candidates raised that much or more, just in the last three months.

Fueled by an energetic base of small donors, Democrats are going into the final stretch of the election with a substantial financial advantage, erasing Republicans' typical fundraising edge.

The money is flowing to unlikely districts and is frequently tied to Democrats' opposition to President Trump.

In Fresno, Calif., prosecutor Andrew Janz, a Democrat, raised an eye-popping $4.1 million in the third quarter. He's out to topple an eight-term Republican, Rep. Devin Nunes, chair of the House Intelligence Committee and a staunch ally of President Trump.

Janz said his donor base is widespread. ""In many parts of the country and in many parts of our state here, and even locally, people wanted this guy out of office,"" he said.

Sharice Davids, in an eastern Kansas district, raised $2.7 million. Amy McGrath, in central Kentucky, raised $3.65 million. Elissa Slotkin, in southern Michigan, raised $2.6 million.

Good and bad news for Republicans

Spending numbers compiled by the Congressional Leadership Fund, a GOP super PAC aligned with House Republicans, and obtained by NPR, offer Republicans some good news and some bad news.

The good: The Congressional Leadership Fund has spent $90 million on the general-election campaign, versus $51 million by its Democratic rival, the House Majority PAC.

The bad news: The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, or DCCC, has outspent the NRCC $64 million to $47 million.

And more bad news: Democratic House candidates, thanks to the outpouring of small-donor contributions, have outspent Republican candidates, $109 million to $60 million.

""The Republican super PACs may not be able to just write a single check to buy a single race because of the massive grassroots fundraising energy behind Democrats this year,"" said former DCCC chair Steve Israel.

But fundraising success doesn't guarantee Democrats an easy glide path to victory. Most of them are challenging incumbents, who, by definition, have won at least once on the same terrain.

Andrew Janz's opponent, Devin Nunes, was reelected two years ago with a 35-point margin. A poll last week showed Nunes leading Janz by 8 points.

Janz initially focused on building a robust fundraising operation, he said, because ""we knew that the national party and the DCCC weren't going to be supporting us.""

Triage time

Both parties, but especially the Republicans, are starting the triage process of reallocating super PAC and party funds from candidates who have failed to gain momentum.

""The campaign committees are going to have to decide which races they're going to fund, and which races they're going to pull out of,"" said Tom Davis, a former Republican congressman who worked two election cycles as chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, or NRCC.

For some House Republicans, the race may be virtually over. Reps. Rod Blum of Iowa, Mike Coffman of Colorado and Mike Bishop of Michigan are among those who have lost support as the NRCC and CLF cancel ad buys and shift dollars to other contests with better prospects.

Duncan Hunter's indictment over crazy spending threatens a political dynasty,2018-08-24,Chris Woodyard,"CLOSE Rep. Duncan Hunter ( R-California ) vaped and spoke out against a ban on vaping devices during a House Transportation hearing . VPC
LOS ANGELES – As political careers go , U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter had it all .
He was first elected in 2008 after his well-regarded father with the same name retired after 28 years in Congress . The younger Hunter impressed voters in a veteran-rich Republican district by having signed up for the Marines after the 2001 terrorist attacks and having gone on to serve tours in Iraq and Afghanistan . As one of the first members of Congress to endorse Donald Trump for president , Hunter 's future could n't have looked brighter .
Now Hunter and wife Margaret face a 60-count federal indictment alleging conspiracy , wire fraud and misspending and falsification of campaign finance records . The indictment details more than $ 250,000 in personal spending with campaign funds , from $ 462.46 for 30 shots of tequila and a steak at a bachelor party to $ 250 to transport a pet , identified in media reports as likely being the family rabbit .
Having routinely used campaign funds as a personal bank account for everything from daily expenses to fancy vacations to Italy , Hawaii and Las Vegas and then engaged in cover-ups , as alleged in the indictment , a jury could bring the Hunter political legacy to a crashing halt .
`` He was set for life , '' said Steven Erie , a professor emeritus at the University of California , San Diego , and author of `` Paradise Plundered : Fiscal Crisis and Governance Failures in San Diego . '' Given the magic of the Hunter name , `` they had a dynasty into perpetuity . ''
Hunter 's alleged misdeeds become the latest political scandal to rock otherwise placid , laid-back San Diego County , 120 miles south of Los Angeles . It recalls the downfall of another well-connected congressman , Randy `` Duke '' Cunningham , a decorated former Navy pilot who resigned in 2005 after being caught in a bribery scandal . The troubles are n't limited to Republicans . Democratic Mayor Robert Filner resigned five years ago and faced charges arising from a sexual harassment case .
`` There 's always been a culture of corruption down here , '' Erie said .
Hunter , 41 , steadfastly denies allegations in the indictment , which was issued Tuesday on a day in which news headlines were dominated by the conviction of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and a guilty plea by longtime Trump lawyer Michael Cohen . Hunter invokes Trump 's name in saying he is the victim of another `` witch hunt '' by the Justice Department .
`` The fact is that there is a culture operating within our Justice Department that is politically motivated , '' Hunter said in a statement . `` We are seeing this with President Trump ; we are seeing this with my case . ''
As proof , he cites the fact that the indictment comes little more than two months ahead of an election in which he is seeking a sixth term – and a trial is n't likely until next year . He said he was n't called in by prosecutors to deliver an explanation for the dozens of instances of spending that was allegedly done with campaign funds .
Yet there is no answer to an overarching question : How a congressman with a salary of $ 174,000 a year plus perks managed to overspend to such an extent that he would have needed to dip deeply into campaign funds even for mundane household expenses . The indictment lays out multiple instances in which the Hunter family appeared to be down to its last dimes , diverting campaign funds to cover bank accounts that had dwindled to a few dollars or gone into the red .
It was n't the first time the hint of scandal had touched the family . In 1992 , his father , then-Rep. Duncan L. Hunter , was cleared of criminal wrongdoing in a House banking scandal that enveloped members of Congress from both parties . The elder Hunter had written 399 overdrafted checks that were covered by the House 's informal banking system .
But few would have expected the son , Duncan Duane Hunter , to have encountered those kinds of financial issues . To political kingmakers , he appeared special from the start . Born on Pearl Harbor Day , Dec. 7 , in the nation 's bicentennial year , 1976 , he graduated from a high school in his district , Granite Hills in El Cajon , and he earned his business degree from San Diego State University . After college , he worked as a business analyst .
His defining moment , however , came after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 when he said he marched straight to the Marine Corps recruiting office . As an artillery officer , he served two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan before returning home in 2005 and continuing to serve in the reserves , where he was promoted to the rank of major in 2012 .

LOS ANGELES – As political careers go, U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter had it all.

He was first elected in 2008 after his well-regarded father with the same name retired after 28 years in Congress. The younger Hunter impressed voters in a veteran-rich Republican district by having signed up for the Marines after the 2001 terrorist attacks and having gone on to serve tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. As one of the first members of Congress to endorse Donald Trump for president, Hunter's future couldn't have looked brighter.

Now Hunter and wife Margaret face a 60-count federal indictment alleging conspiracy, wire fraud and misspending and falsification of campaign finance records. The indictment details more than $250,000 in personal spending with campaign funds, from $462.46 for 30 shots of tequila and a steak at a bachelor party to $250 to transport a pet, identified in media reports as likely being the family rabbit.

Having routinely used campaign funds as a personal bank account for everything from daily expenses to fancy vacations to Italy, Hawaii and Las Vegas and then engaged in cover-ups, as alleged in the indictment, a jury could bring the Hunter political legacy to a crashing halt.

'Set for life'

""He was set for life,"" said Steven Erie, a professor emeritus at the University of California, San Diego, and author of ""Paradise Plundered: Fiscal Crisis and Governance Failures in San Diego."" Given the magic of the Hunter name, ""they had a dynasty into perpetuity.""

Hunter's alleged misdeeds become the latest political scandal to rock otherwise placid, laid-back San Diego County, 120 miles south of Los Angeles. It recalls the downfall of another well-connected congressman, Randy ""Duke"" Cunningham, a decorated former Navy pilot who resigned in 2005 after being caught in a bribery scandal. The troubles aren't limited to Republicans. Democratic Mayor Robert Filner resigned five years ago and faced charges arising from a sexual harassment case.

""There's always been a culture of corruption down here,"" Erie said.

Hunter, 41, steadfastly denies allegations in the indictment, which was issued Tuesday on a day in which news headlines were dominated by the conviction of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and a guilty plea by longtime Trump lawyer Michael Cohen. Hunter invokes Trump's name in saying he is the victim of another ""witch hunt"" by the Justice Department.

""The fact is that there is a culture operating within our Justice Department that is politically motivated,"" Hunter said in a statement. ""We are seeing this with President Trump; we are seeing this with my case.""

As proof, he cites the fact that the indictment comes little more than two months ahead of an election in which he is seeking a sixth term – and a trial isn't likely until next year. He said he wasn't called in by prosecutors to deliver an explanation for the dozens of instances of spending that was allegedly done with campaign funds.

Yet there is no answer to an overarching question: How a congressman with a salary of $174,000 a year plus perks managed to overspend to such an extent that he would have needed to dip deeply into campaign funds even for mundane household expenses. The indictment lays out multiple instances in which the Hunter family appeared to be down to its last dimes, diverting campaign funds to cover bank accounts that had dwindled to a few dollars or gone into the red.

Hint of scandal

It wasn't the first time the hint of scandal had touched the family. In 1992, his father, then-Rep. Duncan L. Hunter, was cleared of criminal wrongdoing in a House banking scandal that enveloped members of Congress from both parties. The elder Hunter had written 399 overdrafted checks that were covered by the House's informal banking system.

But few would have expected the son, Duncan Duane Hunter, to have encountered those kinds of financial issues. To political kingmakers, he appeared special from the start. Born on Pearl Harbor Day, Dec. 7, in the nation's bicentennial year, 1976, he graduated from a high school in his district, Granite Hills in El Cajon, and he earned his business degree from San Diego State University. After college, he worked as a business analyst.

His defining moment, however, came after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 when he said he marched straight to the Marine Corps recruiting office. As an artillery officer, he served two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan before returning home in 2005 and continuing to serve in the reserves, where he was promoted to the rank of major in 2012.

Hunter and his wife have two daughters and a son named, predictably, Duncan. He is listed as representing the district from Alpine, a small rural community east of San Diego. His inland district is far more blue-collar and conservative than coastal San Diego. In the 2016 presidential race, the 50th congressional district, which also includes parts of Riverside County, voted 54.6 percent for Trump compared to 39.6 percent for Clinton. San Diego County, as a whole, went the opposite -- Clinton by a 56.3 percent to 36.6 percent margin.

""The east county is super conservative,"" said Mike Slater, whose KFMB-AM afternoon talk show centered on Hunter and the indictment earlier this week. It ""might as well be Texas or West Virginia...Those are people who supported the Hunter family for decades.""

Now, armed their the 47-page indictment, Democrats may try to pour campaign money into the district thinking they have a fighting chance.

Not only does the indictment show spending for everyday stuff -- there were 45 instances that the couple spent a total of $6,312.81 at Albertsons supermarket and Haggen Food & Pharmacy -- but ruses that aimed at covering up the fact.

'Italy was amazing'

Margaret Hunter spent $2,569.96 at Barnes & Noble on 22 occasions, including $85.18 for children's booklets and puzzles that were listed as ""booklets for San Diego,"" the indictment states.

The campaign fund paid $14,261.33 in 2015 for a family trip to Italy that Margaret Hunter told the treasurer was ""mostly military/defense meet related"" even though she later emailed a friend to say ""Italy was amazing. Truly our best family trip so far. Like that saying 'if traveling was free you'd never see me again.'""

Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has a huge lead over other Democratic presidential candidates in the number of individual donors they have each accumulated so far.

This is the first time since the primary race began in earnest that we can estimate how many individual donors each candidate has attracted — a key indicator of how much they are catching on with voters.

Raising money from Wall Street for a presidential campaign might be becoming a liability , especially for Democrats .
“ This whole thing is coming to a historic moment where the Democrats have to say if they ’ re going to be the Wall Street party or the party of small-dollar donors , ” Waleed Shahid , a spokesperson for the activist group Justice Democrats , told me .
In 2016 , the Democratic fundraising platform ActBlue took in nearly $ 800 million in small-dollar donations ; in 2018 , a non-presidential year , campaigns raised $ 1.6 billion through ActBlue . Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-VT ) proved you could run a real presidential campaign around grassroots support , and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ( D-NY ) used similar tactics last year . Republicans have launched Patriot Pass , their answer to ActBlue .
But as important as small-dollar donations have become , some Democrats are still reportedly heading to Wall Street as they get their campaigns up and running .
“ Short of calling Exxon Mobil executives , I don ’ t think there ’ s anything worse you could do than stake your campaign out as a Wall Street campaign in 2019 , ” said one progressive Democratic strategist , who spoke with me on the condition of anonymity .
In recent weeks , I spoke with multiple strategists and fundraisers — mostly Democrats , but some Republicans — to ask whether going to Wall Street for backing in politics was still allowed . Opinions were split about eschewing cash from Wall Street — and corporate America more broadly — entirely . Those in the more progressive wing of the party said any perceived alignment was a nonstarter and unwise , even immoral . But in a competitive race with as many as 30 candidates , some are reluctant to give up any edge .
“ Do you want to entirely disarm against a Republican Koch brothers-funded Death Star ? ” said Amanda Litman , the co-founder of Run for Something , an organization that supports young candidates running for office .
Most agreed that small-dollar fundraising is at least the most important avenue for candidates : The ability to generate enthusiasm among a big pool of individual donors translates to enthusiasm for the campaign overall . Plus , people who give small amounts of money to a campaign are likelier to volunteer for those candidates , tell their friends about them , and vote for them . Sen. Kamala Harris ’ s ( D-CA ) campaign celebrated that she had received online contributions from all 50 states within half an hour of announcing her presidential bid .
NEWS : In the first 30 minutes after she announced she was running for president , @ KamalaHarris received individual online contributions from all 50 states . — Ian Sams ( @ IanSams ) January 21 , 2019
“ Money in politics isn ’ t going anywhere anytime soon , ” Adam Parkhomenko , a Democratic strategist who served as the national field director for the Democratic National Committee in 2016 , said . “ I don ’ t think there ’ s any reason why any Democrat needs to unilaterally disarm when it comes to fundraising . ”
Wall Street ties were a big deal in 2016 . We don ’ t know if they will be in 2020 .
Sens . Kirsten Gillibrand ( D-NY ) and Cory Booker ( D-NJ ) have come under scrutiny for their perceived ties to big financial interests , while Sens . Elizabeth Warren ( D-MA ) and Sanders are positioned as the anti-Wall Street candidates . It could turn into a dynamic similar to the one between Hillary Clinton and Sanders in 2016 , but whether it will is unclear .
“ I ’ m not sure that Wall Street has the same sort of salience as a villain that it may have had in the last few cycles , ” David Gold , director of research at the public affairs firm Global Strategy Group , said .
To a certain extent , Gillibrand and Booker have similar plausible explanations to Clinton as to their Wall Street ties : As they are New York and New Jersey lawmakers , many of their constituents work in finance . Still , that defense didn ’ t help Clinton shake questions about her loyalties .
Of course , it also comes down to candidates ’ records . “ Sanders did a good job of manipulating the campaign narrative ” in 2016 , Erik Smith , a partner at the strategy firm Blue Engine Message & Media , said . “ I ’ m not willing to tell you what that will be next time , because we don ’ t know who the candidates are . ”
Even if Wall Street isn ’ t the villain , small-dollar donations are going to be more important .
“ It ’ s a sign of health for their campaign , ” Mindy Finn , a Republican strategist , said . “ It also frees up a candidate to spend more of their time connecting with voters on the ground and less of their time having to cater to the wealthiest set of Americans . ”
If a candidate isn ’ t succeeding in online fundraising , it ’ s likely that he or she isn ’ t resonating .
“ You ’ re seeing the valuation of a candidate ’ s strength based on their ability to do small-dollar fundraising , ” said Toby Fallsgraff , a digital strategist who worked on Barack Obama ’ s and Hillary Clinton ’ s campaigns .
Gillibrand and Harris , both of whom have launched exploratory committees , have said they won ’ t take corporate PAC money , as have Warren , Booker , and Sanders . It ’ s likely most , if not all , Democrats in the race will do the same .
One important sign on that front : The DNC this year will include in its primary debate criteria a candidate ’ s “ grassroots fundraising . ”
That means that even candidates who do plan to use traditional methods of fundraising will have to do small-dollar as well . That might especially spell trouble for the potential self-funders , such as billionaire Michael Bloomberg and former Starbucks executive Howard Schultz . ( Schultz reportedly might run as an independent . )
While grassroots donations are probably the better way for candidates to go over taking Wall Street and corporation money , there are a lot of details and subtleties to the topic that make it a lot less cut and dried than it seems .
“ It gets more nuanced , and that makes the debate a little bit more difficult , ” Adam Bozzi , the communications director at End Citizens United , said . “ There ’ s a difference between a bank teller and a corporate executive at a bank . ”
This means a $ 2,700 maximum donation from a Wall Street executive and 100 $ 27 donations from employees of that executive ’ s company tell very different stories , but it ’ s not always reported that way . You ’ ll often see reports that certain candidates got a lot of money from the banking industry , for example , but that money is often coming from employees , not executives .
Beto O ’ Rourke , who is from Texas , got a lot of donations from the oil and gas industry because there are a lot of people who work in that sector where he ’ s from . Donors in the securities and investment industry were the No . 4 givers to Ocasio-Cortez ’ s congressional campaign .
Focusing on small-dollar donations and saying no to corporate PAC checks and Wall Street bundlers seem obvious , but how to approach Super PACs might be a bit more complicated . Candidates can ’ t always control what outside money is spent on them , and if they shun Super PACs — including those with some Wall Street money — they may be at an important disadvantage in the general election .
Most Democratic candidates oppose the 2010 Supreme Court Citizens United decision , which opened the door to outside spending — but like it or not , it ’ s the lay of the land for now . Saying no to Super PACs , including ones fueled by Wall Street money , may mean trouble .
“ It ’ s not worth cutting off your legs to take a philosophical and moral position that will potentially cost you any shot at the nomination , ” Ryan Williams , a Republican strategist at Targeted Victory , said .
That ’ s the calculation both Clinton and Obama made in their elections in 2016 and 2012 .
“ We ’ re not going to fight this fight with one hand tied behind our back , ” Jim Messina , Obama ’ s reelection campaign manager in 2012 , told the New York Times of Obama ’ s decision to accept backing from an outside Super PAC .
It is also the case that candidates can ’ t always control what outside money is spent on them . Many 2020 Democrats say they ’ ll reject Super PAC support , but such groups may be able to spend on them anyway .

“ It seems like the days when your fundraising relied entirely on keeping a relatively small group of high-dollar donors happy are gone , ” Fallsgraff said .","Share All sharing options for: Democrats weigh whether Wall Street money is still allowed in 2020

Raising money from Wall Street for a presidential campaign might be becoming a liability, especially for Democrats.

“This whole thing is coming to a historic moment where the Democrats have to say if they’re going to be the Wall Street party or the party of small-dollar donors,” Waleed Shahid, a spokesperson for the activist group Justice Democrats, told me.

In 2016, the Democratic fundraising platform ActBlue took in nearly $800 million in small-dollar donations; in 2018, a non-presidential year, campaigns raised $1.6 billion through ActBlue. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) proved you could run a real presidential campaign around grassroots support, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) used similar tactics last year. Republicans have launched Patriot Pass, their answer to ActBlue.

But as important as small-dollar donations have become, some Democrats are still reportedly heading to Wall Street as they get their campaigns up and running.

“Short of calling Exxon Mobil executives, I don’t think there’s anything worse you could do than stake your campaign out as a Wall Street campaign in 2019,” said one progressive Democratic strategist, who spoke with me on the condition of anonymity.

In recent weeks, I spoke with multiple strategists and fundraisers — mostly Democrats, but some Republicans — to ask whether going to Wall Street for backing in politics was still allowed. Opinions were split about eschewing cash from Wall Street — and corporate America more broadly — entirely. Those in the more progressive wing of the party said any perceived alignment was a nonstarter and unwise, even immoral. But in a competitive race with as many as 30 candidates, some are reluctant to give up any edge.

“Do you want to entirely disarm against a Republican Koch brothers-funded Death Star?” said Amanda Litman, the co-founder of Run for Something, an organization that supports young candidates running for office.

Most agreed that small-dollar fundraising is at least the most important avenue for candidates: The ability to generate enthusiasm among a big pool of individual donors translates to enthusiasm for the campaign overall. Plus, people who give small amounts of money to a campaign are likelier to volunteer for those candidates, tell their friends about them, and vote for them. Sen. Kamala Harris’s (D-CA) campaign celebrated that she had received online contributions from all 50 states within half an hour of announcing her presidential bid.

“Money in politics isn’t going anywhere anytime soon,” Adam Parkhomenko, a Democratic strategist who served as the national field director for the Democratic National Committee in 2016, said. “I don’t think there’s any reason why any Democrat needs to unilaterally disarm when it comes to fundraising.”

Especially when it comes to taking out President Trump.

Wall Street ties were a big deal in 2016. We don’t know if they will be in 2020.

Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Cory Booker (D-NJ) have come under scrutiny for their perceived ties to big financial interests, while Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Sanders are positioned as the anti-Wall Street candidates. It could turn into a dynamic similar to the one between Hillary Clinton and Sanders in 2016, but whether it will is unclear.

“I’m not sure that Wall Street has the same sort of salience as a villain that it may have had in the last few cycles,” David Gold, director of research at the public affairs firm Global Strategy Group, said.

To a certain extent, Gillibrand and Booker have similar plausible explanations to Clinton as to their Wall Street ties: As they are New York and New Jersey lawmakers, many of their constituents work in finance. Still, that defense didn’t help Clinton shake questions about her loyalties.

Of course, it also comes down to candidates’ records. “Sanders did a good job of manipulating the campaign narrative” in 2016, Erik Smith, a partner at the strategy firm Blue Engine Message & Media, said. “I’m not willing to tell you what that will be next time, because we don’t know who the candidates are.”

Grassroots fundraising is overtaking traditional methods

Even if Wall Street isn’t the villain, small-dollar donations are going to be more important.

“It’s a sign of health for their campaign,” Mindy Finn, a Republican strategist, said. “It also frees up a candidate to spend more of their time connecting with voters on the ground and less of their time having to cater to the wealthiest set of Americans.”

If a candidate isn’t succeeding in online fundraising, it’s likely that he or she isn’t resonating.

“You’re seeing the valuation of a candidate’s strength based on their ability to do small-dollar fundraising,” said Toby Fallsgraff, a digital strategist who worked on Barack Obama’s and Hillary Clinton’s campaigns.

Gillibrand and Harris, both of whom have launched exploratory committees, have said they won’t take corporate PAC money, as have Warren, Booker, and Sanders. It’s likely most, if not all, Democrats in the race will do the same.

One important sign on that front: The DNC this year will include in its primary debate criteria a candidate’s “grassroots fundraising.”

That means that even candidates who do plan to use traditional methods of fundraising will have to do small-dollar as well. That might especially spell trouble for the potential self-funders, such as billionaire Michael Bloomberg and former Starbucks executive Howard Schultz. (Schultz reportedly might run as an independent.)

The conversation requires some nuance

While grassroots donations are probably the better way for candidates to go over taking Wall Street and corporation money, there are a lot of details and subtleties to the topic that make it a lot less cut and dried than it seems.

“It gets more nuanced, and that makes the debate a little bit more difficult,” Adam Bozzi, the communications director at End Citizens United, said. “There’s a difference between a bank teller and a corporate executive at a bank.”

This means a $2,700 maximum donation from a Wall Street executive and 100 $27 donations from employees of that executive’s company tell very different stories, but it’s not always reported that way. You’ll often see reports that certain candidates got a lot of money from the banking industry, for example, but that money is often coming from employees, not executives.

Beto O’Rourke, who is from Texas, got a lot of donations from the oil and gas industry because there are a lot of people who work in that sector where he’s from. Donors in the securities and investment industry were the No. 4 givers to Ocasio-Cortez’s congressional campaign.

The Super PAC debate is still hard

Focusing on small-dollar donations and saying no to corporate PAC checks and Wall Street bundlers seem obvious, but how to approach Super PACs might be a bit more complicated. Candidates can’t always control what outside money is spent on them, and if they shun Super PACs — including those with some Wall Street money — they may be at an important disadvantage in the general election.

Most Democratic candidates oppose the 2010 Supreme Court Citizens United decision, which opened the door to outside spending — but like it or not, it’s the lay of the land for now. Saying no to Super PACs, including ones fueled by Wall Street money, may mean trouble.

“It’s not worth cutting off your legs to take a philosophical and moral position that will potentially cost you any shot at the nomination,” Ryan Williams, a Republican strategist at Targeted Victory, said.

That’s the calculation both Clinton and Obama made in their elections in 2016 and 2012.

“We’re not going to fight this fight with one hand tied behind our back,” Jim Messina, Obama’s reelection campaign manager in 2012, told the New York Times of Obama’s decision to accept backing from an outside Super PAC.

It is also the case that candidates can’t always control what outside money is spent on them. Many 2020 Democrats say they’ll reject Super PAC support, but such groups may be able to spend on them anyway. A nurses union Super PAC backed Sanders in 2016, even as he slammed Clinton for her Super PAC ties.

But no matter what, it’s clear the fundraising landscape has changed for good.

The House GOP ’ s campaign arm pulled the plug on its remaining ad buys last week for the Pittsburgh media market , where Rep. Keith Rothfus Keith James RothfusConor Lamb gets 2020 challenger touted by Trump The 31 Trump districts that will determine the next House majority Trump 's most memorable insults and nicknames of 2018 MORE ( R-Pa. ) is desperately fighting to hang on to his seat in a race against Rep. Conor Lamb ( D-Pa. ) .
It ’ s grim news for Rothfus , who has largely been seen as a dead man walking since redistricting left him with a Democratic-leaning district and a difficult opponent in Lamb .
For the GOP , it ’ s likely a sign of things to come as the party seeks to target its money toward the races most likely to save its majority . Democrats need 23 seats to take back control of the House , and the GOP is defending dozens of seats that are seen as vulnerable .
“ It ’ s a giant chessboard , ” said one longtime GOP operative . “ There ’ s obviously limited resources , and you need to make tough decisions . This is sort of an art form as opposed to a science . ”

If the news turns bad , it will lead to difficult calls between the NRCC and incumbent GOP lawmakers .
“ There could be a bunch more . It all depends on the polling . People evaluate these things on an hourly , daily basis , ” said one former NRCC staffer . “ These decisions aren ’ t made lightly . If you have a race that ’ s just not winnable and you have limited resources , you can ’ t spend just to make somebody feel better . ”

“ Any time you cut bait , especially on a member of Congress , it ’ s a hard decision — but one that has to be made , ” the former staffer added . “ It ’ s always a stab in the back whenever that happens to a campaign . ”
Democrats have better-sounding decisions to make , though the party will be second-guessed if it makes the wrong calls on where to put its money a little more than 40 days before the elections .
On Monday , the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ( DCCC ) canceled all remaining TV spending planned in Cedar Rapids , Iowa , where Democrats are feeling increasingly confident about their chances of flipping a seat .
“ It ’ s a good problem to have for the Democrats , ” the GOP operative said .
Midterm elections are historically tough for the president ’ s party , which typically loses around 30 seats in the president ’ s first midterm . President Trump Donald John TrumpFive takeaways from the Democratic debate Sanders , Warren exchange underscores Iowa stakes CNN 's Van Jones : Democratic debate was 'dispiriting , ' no evidence party can defeat Trump MORE ’ s low approval ratings and the intense political passions that have stirred over the past two years have Democrats hoping that they ’ ll ride a large wave to a House majority this fall .
Democrats also have more money , as the DCCC has nearly $ 70 million in cash on hand , compared to the NRCC ’ s $ 65 million , according to the latest data filed with the Federal Election Commission .
Republicans have more than one reason to not want to cut off support to some of their vulnerable members .
The optics of cutting off support to a female lawmaker like Comstock — especially at a time when the GOP is already poised to lose 25 percent of its female elected officeholders — could be detrimental .
And so far , the party is showing no signs of giving up on her suburban , Northern Virginia-area district that Clinton easily carried in 2016 .

“ The bad PR of canceling on a woman in a tough race I ’ m sure will be weighed in this environment , ” said the former NRCC staffer . “ So we ’ ll see , but that ’ s a lot of money . They might have to move some things around . I would definitely keep an eye on her . She might be the one to be next if they don ’ t see a path to victory . ”
The House GOP ’ s campaign arm already faced criticism this summer for essentially going off the airwaves in August and for allocating funds in districts that some Republicans considered a lost cause .
“ Not every decision is going to be met with universal applause . Both parties need to make those tough decisions . It ’ s not easy , ” said the GOP operative . “ You expose yourself to criticism both before and after the election . ”
On the flip side , Democrats could also face backlash if they blow it this fall .
The DCCC is deciding whether to pull out of races where they feel confident and whether they should start funneling resources to districts that could now be in play , like the districts of indicted Reps.

This week , the party ’ s chief fundraising committee canceled all remaining TV spending reserved in Blum ’ s district in Iowa . It also canceled ad buys scheduled through the end of October in Phoenix , where Rep. Tom O ’ Halleran ( D ) is facing a challenge from Republican Wendy Rogers , though there is an ad reservation through Oct. 8 .
O ’ Halleran ’ s district , which went for Trump by just 1 point in 2016 , is rated “ likely Democratic ” by the Cook Political Report . But Blum ’ s race is considered “ lean Democratic ” and Republicans have been stumping hard to keep the seat in GOP hands .
“ We never take anything for granted , but these candidates have run very effective campaigns and put themselves in a solid position , ” said one Democratic operative .
The parties consider a whole host of factors when deciding where to spend their money .
That includes poll numbers , whether the candidate is running a good campaign and fundraising on their own , what the opponent is doing in the race , whether outside groups are willing to step in and the level of overall resources that the party has .
Preference is also usually given to an incumbent as opposed to a congressional candidate who is running for an open seat .
And the cost of advertising in a certain media market also factors heavily into the decisionmaking process .
“ If I ’ m looking at a race where we can probably stay in the race or get in the race , but it ’ s gon na cost us a fortune — could I spend that money in three other races with cheaper markets where we have a better chance ? ” said the Republican operative .
“ It ’ s a cost-benefit thing . We might be able to get more bang for our buck in three districts . ”","Republicans are performing critical triage to their midterm spending strategy as they seek to hold on to their House majority in a difficult midterm year.

Keith Rothfus Keith James RothfusConor Lamb gets 2020 challenger touted by Trump The 31 Trump districts that will determine the next House majority Trump's most memorable insults and nicknames of 2018 MORE (R-Pa.) is desperately fighting to hang on to his seat in a race against Rep. Conor Lamb (D-Pa.).

It’s grim news for Rothfus, who has largely been seen as a dead man walking since redistricting left him with a Democratic-leaning district and a difficult opponent in Lamb.

For the GOP, it’s likely a sign of things to come as the party seeks to target its money toward the races most likely to save its majority. Democrats need 23 seats to take back control of the House, and the GOP is defending dozens of seats that are seen as vulnerable.

“It’s a giant chessboard,” said one longtime GOP operative. “There’s obviously limited resources, and you need to make tough decisions. This is sort of an art form as opposed to a science.”

The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) must decide if it should put energy into competitive and Democratic-leaning districts that Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonVan Jones: Sanders stepped on a banana peel in exchange with Warren Video emerges of Sanders saying in 1988 a woman could be elected president Trump: 'I don't believe' Sanders said a woman can't win the presidency MORE carried in 2016 — or if the party is better served protecting GOP strongholds that could be in play if a “blue wave” materializes.

If the news turns bad, it will lead to difficult calls between the NRCC and incumbent GOP lawmakers.

“There could be a bunch more. It all depends on the polling. People evaluate these things on an hourly, daily basis,” said one former NRCC staffer. “These decisions aren’t made lightly. If you have a race that’s just not winnable and you have limited resources, you can’t spend just to make somebody feel better.”

Besides Rothfus, the GOP incumbents who are locked in competitive races tilted in Democrats’ favor include Reps.

“Any time you cut bait, especially on a member of Congress, it’s a hard decision — but one that has to be made,” the former staffer added. “It’s always a stab in the back whenever that happens to a campaign.”

Democrats have better-sounding decisions to make, though the party will be second-guessed if it makes the wrong calls on where to put its money a little more than 40 days before the elections.

On Monday, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) canceled all remaining TV spending planned in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, where Democrats are feeling increasingly confident about their chances of flipping a seat.

“It’s a good problem to have for the Democrats,” the GOP operative said.

Midterm elections are historically tough for the president’s party, which typically loses around 30 seats in the president’s first midterm. President Trump Donald John TrumpFive takeaways from the Democratic debate Sanders, Warren exchange underscores Iowa stakes CNN's Van Jones: Democratic debate was 'dispiriting,' no evidence party can defeat Trump MORE’s low approval ratings and the intense political passions that have stirred over the past two years have Democrats hoping that they’ll ride a large wave to a House majority this fall.

Democrats also have more money, as the DCCC has nearly $70 million in cash on hand, compared to the NRCC’s $65 million, according to the latest data filed with the Federal Election Commission.

Republicans have more than one reason to not want to cut off support to some of their vulnerable members.

The optics of cutting off support to a female lawmaker like Comstock — especially at a time when the GOP is already poised to lose 25 percent of its female elected officeholders — could be detrimental.

And so far, the party is showing no signs of giving up on her suburban, Northern Virginia-area district that Clinton easily carried in 2016.

Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis RyanEsper's chief of staff to depart at end of January Latinos say they didn't benefit from Trump tax cuts — here's why Conservative commentator rips Trump's signature tax overhaul: 'It was a big mistake' MORE (R-Wis.) is slated to attend an October fundraising event for Comstock next month, according to the Washington Examiner, while the NRCC has reserved $5 million in ads for the targeted lawmaker.

“The bad PR of canceling on a woman in a tough race I’m sure will be weighed in this environment,” said the former NRCC staffer. “So we’ll see, but that’s a lot of money. They might have to move some things around. I would definitely keep an eye on her. She might be the one to be next if they don’t see a path to victory.”

The House GOP’s campaign arm already faced criticism this summer for essentially going off the airwaves in August and for allocating funds in districts that some Republicans considered a lost cause.

“Not every decision is going to be met with universal applause. Both parties need to make those tough decisions. It’s not easy,” said the GOP operative. “You expose yourself to criticism both before and after the election.”

On the flip side, Democrats could also face backlash if they blow it this fall.

The DCCC is deciding whether to pull out of races where they feel confident and whether they should start funneling resources to districts that could now be in play, like the districts of indicted Reps.

Chris Collins at 'top end' of guidelines House passes bill to explicitly ban insider trading Duncan Hunter pleads guilty after changing plea MORE (R-N.Y.).

This week, the party’s chief fundraising committee canceled all remaining TV spending reserved in Blum’s district in Iowa. It also canceled ad buys scheduled through the end of October in Phoenix, where Rep. Tom O’Halleran (D) is facing a challenge from Republican Wendy Rogers, though there is an ad reservation through Oct. 8.

O’Halleran’s district, which went for Trump by just 1 point in 2016, is rated “likely Democratic” by the Cook Political Report. But Blum’s race is considered “lean Democratic” and Republicans have been stumping hard to keep the seat in GOP hands.

“We never take anything for granted, but these candidates have run very effective campaigns and put themselves in a solid position,” said one Democratic operative.

The parties consider a whole host of factors when deciding where to spend their money.

That includes poll numbers, whether the candidate is running a good campaign and fundraising on their own, what the opponent is doing in the race, whether outside groups are willing to step in and the level of overall resources that the party has.

Preference is also usually given to an incumbent as opposed to a congressional candidate who is running for an open seat.

And the cost of advertising in a certain media market also factors heavily into the decisionmaking process.

“If I’m looking at a race where we can probably stay in the race or get in the race, but it’s gonna cost us a fortune — could I spend that money in three other races with cheaper markets where we have a better chance?” said the Republican operative.

“It’s a cost-benefit thing. We might be able to get more bang for our buck in three districts.”",www.thehill.com,center,teQ8rsY9eK69L2M3

And President Donald Trump and his allies continued to build a massive war chest for the general election.

Here are some key takeaways from February's campaign-finance reports:

Biden starts to find financial footing

Biden raised more than $18 million in February -- twice the amount his campaign had collected the previous month, and the former vice president entered March with a little more than $12 million remaining in his campaign account.

And that was before his sweep of victories coast to coast this month solidified his political comeback. During the CNN-Univision debate earlier this week , Biden indicated that his campaign already had brought in $33 million in the first two weeks of March.

In February, Biden saw his standing among small-dollar donors improve. About 45% of his individual contributions that month came from in amounts of $200 or less, nearly on par with Trump's February performance among small-dollar contributors.

The campaign did not disclose how much was raised at the event, organized by cosmetics company founder Bobbi Brown.

Earlier Friday, the campaign sent an email to supporters offering a possible ""video call"" with the former vice president to those who chip in online.

Sanders outspent Biden -- by a lot

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders raised a massive sum in February -- more than $47 million, according to his campaign's filing Friday with the Federal Election Commission.

And he spent nearly as much: Burning through $45 million -- or more than three times the $13.1 million spent by Biden's camp in February.

Despite the heavy spending, Sanders entered March with a substantial financial cushion of nearly $18.7 million in leftover cash, his filings show.

Sanders said this week he still was assessing the state of his campaign after the string of Biden victories had effectively closed his path to the Democratic presidential nomination.

Trump stockpile

Even as Biden has touted fresh donations, Democrats are up against the well-funded machine of an incumbent president.

The Trump campaign and affiliated committees brought in more than $86 million in February, according to campaign manager Brad Parscale.

And Trump entered the month with $94.4 million remaining in his campaign coffers, according to the filings with the Federal Election Commission.

Bloomberg's billion-dollar bet

The new filings also revealed Bloomberg had invested a staggering $935 million of his personal fortune through February into his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination -- shattering all records for self-funded candidates.

In February alone, the former New York City mayor's campaign reported spending $466 million -- or roughly $16 million a day.

The billionaire left the race this month, a little more than three months after he launched his campaign, having won just a single contest: the tiny US territory of American Samoa

Warren's benefactor revealed

Most of the super PAC money spent to boost Warren's presidential campaign came from a single source: Silicon Valley donor Karla Jurvetson, who provided $14.6 million to the pro-Warren Persist PAC , the filings show.

The group launched in February and quickly ramped up its spending ahead of the Nevada caucuses in an effort to boost the Massachusetts senator as her campaign struggled. In all, the PAC spent more than $13.5 million on advertising to influence the race, according to data compiled by the ad-tracking firm CMAG.

Warren, who made fighting big-money corruption a central tenet of her White House bid, reversed course and declined to disavow super PAC help once Persist PAC began to work on her behalf.

Jurvetson's donation accounted for the vast majority of the $15.1 million the Persist PAC reported collecting in February.

WASHINGTON — The national political parties and some of their biggest donors are embracing a new law that dramatically increases contribution limits, saying it could help the parties stage a financial comeback in an era of unlimited spending by super PACs.

Reid was responding to comments from Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) , who howled over President Barack Obama ’ s crackdown on politically active tax-exempt organizations as “ declaring a war not just on its opponents , but on free speech itself. ” McConnell compared the administration ’ s proposed rules on those groups to the Internal Revenue Service ’ s targeting of outside groups and said Democrats are trying to stifle their election-year critics .
Reid hammered the networks backed by David and Charles Koch as political organizations masquerading as social welfare groups and criticizing McConnell ’ s efforts to help them .
“ Because of a United States Supreme Court decisions called Citizens United , there ’ s been some really untoward stuff going on in the political world . We have two brothers who are actually trying to buy the country , ” Reid said . “ The Republican leader has long been an opponent of campaign finance reform . This has been part of his career . So it is no surprise he opposes the administration ’ s efforts for greater disclosure . The abuse here is not the administration ’ s enforcing the law , but folks like the Koch brothers pretending to be social welfare organizations . ”
The administration ’ s proposed rules would limit the ability of nonprofit groups organized around “ social welfare ” to engage in political activities . McConnell said Democrats are surveying a difficult midterm election cycle and trying to muzzle groups that back Republican candidates .
“ Democrats think 2014 is shaping up to be a tough year for them politically .

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid slammed the Koch brothers’ political activities Thursday, accusing the influential conservatives of trying to “buy the country.”

Reid was responding to comments from Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who howled over President Barack Obama’s crackdown on politically active tax-exempt organizations as “declaring a war not just on its opponents, but on free speech itself.” McConnell compared the administration’s proposed rules on those groups to the Internal Revenue Service’s targeting of outside groups and said Democrats are trying to stifle their election-year critics.

Reid hammered the networks backed by David and Charles Koch as political organizations masquerading as social welfare groups and criticizing McConnell’s efforts to help them.

“Because of a United States Supreme Court decisions called Citizens United, there’s been some really untoward stuff going on in the political world. We have two brothers who are actually trying to buy the country,” Reid said. “The Republican leader has long been an opponent of campaign finance reform. This has been part of his career. So it is no surprise he opposes the administration’s efforts for greater disclosure. The abuse here is not the administration’s enforcing the law, but folks like the Koch brothers pretending to be social welfare organizations.”

The administration’s proposed rules would limit the ability of nonprofit groups organized around “social welfare” to engage in political activities. McConnell said Democrats are surveying a difficult midterm election cycle and trying to muzzle groups that back Republican candidates.

“Democrats think 2014 is shaping up to be a tough year for them politically. So instead of trying to persuade the public that they’ve got the best answers to the problems we face, they try to shut everybody else out of the political process, they try to shut them up,” McConnell said. Obama “wants to use the IRS to drive conservatives right off the playing field.”

Such groups — also called 501(c)(4) nonprofits after a section of the Tax Code — have become an integral part of the campaign finance landscape in recent years.

Democratic operatives as well as Republicans have used tax-exempt groups to shield donors from public scrutiny — while still participating in elections. Government watchdogs say that such electoral activity might be a violation of tax law.

The Treasury Department currently is considering new rules that would curtail some 501(c)(4) political activity.

Reid didn’t dispute that the Koch-backed groups’ spending poses a threat to Democrats, who are fighting tooth and nail to keep the Senate and preserve some control of Congress during Obama’s last two years in office.

“What they’re doing is spending their … dollars on governors races, and on the state level and, of course, spending huge amounts of money around the country attempting to defeat Democrats both in the House and the Senate,” Reid said. “The Koch brothers hide all their campaign efforts. They disguise themselves with rare exception as social welfare organizations, with all these fancy names going after people who are trying to improve the country.”

The Koch brothers — though they are major conservative financiers — have actually previously given to Democrats, including Senate Democrats.

In 2010, they gave nearly $200,000 to Democratic candidates — including a $30,000 donation to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.

Looking to assuage some of those concerns , Mr. Trump has showcased his children , who have impressed even skeptical conservatives , and tapped Indiana Gov . Mike Pence , a well-respected social conservative , as his running mate .
On the policy front , he has promised to nominate Supreme Court justices that will uphold the Constitution , defend “ religious liberty , ” repeal and replace Obamacare and fight to expand school choice for students that are trapped in failing schools .
“ Let me state this upfront : in a Trump administration our Christian heritage will be protected , defended like you have never seen before , ” he said .
He also has surrounded named high-profile figures to his Evangelical Advisory Board , including Tony Perkins , head of the Family Research Council , which hosted the summit here , and former Rep. Michele Bachmann , who praised Mr. Trump ’ s stances on immigration , foreign policy and taxes .

But a small group of Hollywood writers and producers recently gathered over drinks to talk about how to raise money for Warren ’ s presidential campaign without her .
Warren ’ s personal ban on behind-closed-doors fundraising — a practice she now criticizes for giving the wealthy undue access to politicians — presents “ a bit of a challenge ” for the group , said writer and producer Franklin Hardy , who supports Warren ’ s stance . “ Do we have a stand-up comedy night at somebody ’ s house ? Can we get her to Skype in ? Or do we just have big get-togethers ? ”
While accepting that money won ’ t violate Warren ’ s anti-access pledge , it does highlight a shift in the 2020 presidential race . After spending the first months of 2019 fixated on small-dollar online support and adopting rhetoric shunning bigger donors , campaigns are now taking stronger steps to bring wealthy and well-connected supporters into the fold . Jolted by Joe Biden ’ s splashy $ 6.3 million first day in the Democratic primary , many of Biden ’ s rivals are increasingly hungry for bigger donors ’ support .
Former Rep. Beto O ’ Rourke , who raises most of his funds online from small donors , is set to hold his first high-dollar event of the campaign in New York City this week , where attendees have to pledge to raise $ 25,000 for some tickets . South Bend , Ind. , Mayor Pete Buttigieg is holding high-dollar events in cities across the country as he tries to collect on his newfound fame with donors .
Hardy ’ s planning is part of a wider effort to help Warren collect big checks : Warren campaign workers are also in touch with other well-connected volunteers who want to raise money for the Massachusetts senator . And in June , Sen. Kamala Harris ’ campaign will fete people who agree to raise big money for her at a meeting for Harris ’ growing national finance committee in California . The fundraisers will be treated to a look inside the Harris operation , including talks from campaign officials about her strategy and path to victory in 2020 , and details on Harris ’ volunteer training program .

Because virtually all of the major Democratic candidates have said they don ’ t want help from super PACs , the maximum any individual donor can give to support their campaigns is $ 2,800 . And while that pales in comparison to the six- and seven-figure sums some contributors have donated to super PACs in recent elections , those $ 2,800 checks are still significant for campaigns — even more so when well-connected donors can entice dozens of their friends and acquaintances to give as well . With the exception of Sen. Bernie Sanders , who raised more than 80 percent of his campaign money from donations of less than $ 200 during the first three months of the year , most candidates are actively seeking money from both small-dollar online donors and larger donors .
“ Money , unfortunately , is critical to getting your message out , ” said Rufus Gifford , finance director for President Barack Obama ’ s 2012 reelection . “ Our eventual nominee will have built that campaign war chest and have the resources to deliver his or her message . ”
Lining up early support from wealthy and influential backers has long been a key step on any presidential campaign checklist . But this year , many Democrats did less outreach and kept their groundwork hushed , opting to not release early lists of “ national finance committees ” or name campaign “ co-chairs ” of volunteer fundraisers .
Instead , they poured energy into showing voters and small-dollar donors that they prioritized their support ahead of “ the 1 percent. ” Biden , the former vice president , was the only candidate who took the step of lining up financial staff to court donors in each region of the country ahead of his bid .
But raising money only gets more difficult as campaigns wear on , and candidates can tap out their networks of friends and die-hard supporters after the initial wave of excitement surrounding their campaign launches .
“ The second quarter is going to be much harder ” for campaigns , said Tom Nides , a Morgan Stanley executive and Democratic fundraiser who was a deputy secretary of State in the Obama administration .
Indeed , Warren ’ s campaign acknowledged after the first quarter of 2019 that its fundraising pace would have to keep accelerating to grow the massive campaign she has already built , which now includes a staff of over 200 . Warren raised $ 6 million in the first three months of the year , $ 4.2 million of which came from donors giving $ 200 or less — and she spent more than $ 5.2 million during that time . ( Warren also has a cushion of over $ 10 million in her campaign coffers that was transferred from her old Senate campaign account . )
O ’ Rourke , who started his campaign with few connections to wealthy donors outside his home state of Texas , is getting help from a major New York City financier ahead of his Monday fundraiser in the financial capital : Mark Gallogly , a founder of the private investment firm Centerbridge Partners , sent an email ahead of the event urging people to give money to O ’ Rourke ’ s campaign .
The minimum contribution to attend is $ 250 , while attendees can garner extra perks for agreeing to raise up to $ 25,000 for O ’ Rourke .
Buttigieg , who raised nearly two-thirds of his money from small donors in the first quarter , has leaned into the wealthy donor community as his public profile shot up , frequently appearing at fundraisers and encouraging high-profile supporters to sign on to his events as co-hosts rather than keep their support discreet , as many of his competitors are doing . In recent days , he made stops in Los Angeles , Minneapolis and Houston for fundraisers .
Buttigieg will visit Los Angeles again in June and has plans to travel to Boston for a fundraiser hosted by Jack Connors , a philanthropist dubbed by Boston Magazine the “ last king of Boston. ” To take advantage of his newfound cachet with elite donors , the Buttigieg campaign recently hired two Obama alumni , Zach Allen and Adia Smith , to raise money in New York and Los Angeles .

Elizabeth Warren has sworn off attending big-money private fundraisers. But a small group of Hollywood writers and producers recently gathered over drinks to talk about how to raise money for Warren’s presidential campaign without her.

Warren’s personal ban on behind-closed-doors fundraising — a practice she now criticizes for giving the wealthy undue access to politicians — presents “a bit of a challenge” for the group, said writer and producer Franklin Hardy, who supports Warren’s stance. “Do we have a stand-up comedy night at somebody’s house? Can we get her to Skype in? Or do we just have big get-togethers?”

While accepting that money won’t violate Warren’s anti-access pledge, it does highlight a shift in the 2020 presidential race. After spending the first months of 2019 fixated on small-dollar online support and adopting rhetoric shunning bigger donors, campaigns are now taking stronger steps to bring wealthy and well-connected supporters into the fold. Jolted by Joe Biden’s splashy $6.3 million first day in the Democratic primary, many of Biden’s rivals are increasingly hungry for bigger donors’ support.

Former Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who raises most of his funds online from small donors, is set to hold his first high-dollar event of the campaign in New York City this week, where attendees have to pledge to raise $25,000 for some tickets. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg is holding high-dollar events in cities across the country as he tries to collect on his newfound fame with donors.

Hardy’s planning is part of a wider effort to help Warren collect big checks: Warren campaign workers are also in touch with other well-connected volunteers who want to raise money for the Massachusetts senator. And in June, Sen. Kamala Harris’ campaign will fete people who agree to raise big money for her at a meeting for Harris’ growing national finance committee in California. The fundraisers will be treated to a look inside the Harris operation, including talks from campaign officials about her strategy and path to victory in 2020, and details on Harris’ volunteer training program.

Because virtually all of the major Democratic candidates have said they don’t want help from super PACs, the maximum any individual donor can give to support their campaigns is $2,800. And while that pales in comparison to the six- and seven-figure sums some contributors have donated to super PACs in recent elections, those $2,800 checks are still significant for campaigns — even more so when well-connected donors can entice dozens of their friends and acquaintances to give as well. With the exception of Sen. Bernie Sanders, who raised more than 80 percent of his campaign money from donations of less than $200 during the first three months of the year, most candidates are actively seeking money from both small-dollar online donors and larger donors.

“Money, unfortunately, is critical to getting your message out,” said Rufus Gifford, finance director for President Barack Obama’s 2012 reelection. “Our eventual nominee will have built that campaign war chest and have the resources to deliver his or her message.”

Lining up early support from wealthy and influential backers has long been a key step on any presidential campaign checklist. But this year, many Democrats did less outreach and kept their groundwork hushed, opting to not release early lists of “national finance committees” or name campaign “co-chairs” of volunteer fundraisers.

Instead, they poured energy into showing voters and small-dollar donors that they prioritized their support ahead of “the 1 percent.” Biden, the former vice president, was the only candidate who took the step of lining up financial staff to court donors in each region of the country ahead of his bid.

But raising money only gets more difficult as campaigns wear on, and candidates can tap out their networks of friends and die-hard supporters after the initial wave of excitement surrounding their campaign launches.

“The second quarter is going to be much harder” for campaigns, said Tom Nides, a Morgan Stanley executive and Democratic fundraiser who was a deputy secretary of State in the Obama administration.

Indeed, Warren’s campaign acknowledged after the first quarter of 2019 that its fundraising pace would have to keep accelerating to grow the massive campaign she has already built, which now includes a staff of over 200. Warren raised $6 million in the first three months of the year, $4.2 million of which came from donors giving $200 or less — and she spent more than $5.2 million during that time. (Warren also has a cushion of over $10 million in her campaign coffers that was transferred from her old Senate campaign account.)

O’Rourke, who started his campaign with few connections to wealthy donors outside his home state of Texas, is getting help from a major New York City financier ahead of his Monday fundraiser in the financial capital: Mark Gallogly, a founder of the private investment firm Centerbridge Partners, sent an email ahead of the event urging people to give money to O’Rourke’s campaign.

The minimum contribution to attend is $250, while attendees can garner extra perks for agreeing to raise up to $25,000 for O’Rourke.

Buttigieg, who raised nearly two-thirds of his money from small donors in the first quarter, has leaned into the wealthy donor community as his public profile shot up, frequently appearing at fundraisers and encouraging high-profile supporters to sign on to his events as co-hosts rather than keep their support discreet, as many of his competitors are doing. In recent days, he made stops in Los Angeles, Minneapolis and Houston for fundraisers.

Buttigieg will visit Los Angeles again in June and has plans to travel to Boston for a fundraiser hosted by Jack Connors, a philanthropist dubbed by Boston Magazine the “last king of Boston.” To take advantage of his newfound cachet with elite donors, the Buttigieg campaign recently hired two Obama alumni, Zach Allen and Adia Smith, to raise money in New York and Los Angeles.

Warren, who is careful not to violate the fundraising restrictions that she put on her own campaign, is not attracting the throngs of celebrity support that Biden, Buttigieg and Harris have enjoyed so far.

“We get where she’s coming from,” said Hardy, the Hollywood writer and producer. “She doesn’t want to be associated with the traditional ‘Jeffrey Katzenberg has a big thing at his house’ thing,” referring to the film producer who has raised millions of dollars for Democratic candidates and recently co-hosted a Biden fundraiser.

But a small web of volunteer fundraisers like Hardy, nurtured by Warren’s campaign, is taking shape.

Atlanta-based lawyer David Worley, a longtime member of the Democratic National Committee who was vice chair of John Kerry’s finance committee in 2004, is trying to commit time every day to asking people to give money to Warren’s campaign. Worley said he checks in with Warren’s staff about his efforts.

Worley and others who are volunteering their time said they aren’t bothered by Warren’s stance toward money in politics.

“I understand the positions she’s taken about not wanting to have closed-door fundraisers. That’s perfectly fine with me,” Worley said. “I intend to support her as much as I can.”

Meanwhile, Harris is holding her national finance event at a moment when many top donors are helping more than one candidate for president. But people who attend the Harris retreat will be committing to help the Harris campaign exclusively — a move that will help the campaign lock down support at a time of great uncertainty in the Democratic presidential race.

But there are still plenty of donors who are not bending to pressure to commit to one candidate.

The race will be “a long haul,” said Bay Area donor Susie Tompkins Buell, who has lent her support to Buttigieg, Harris and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee so far. Things are likely to change many times over before a nominee emerges from the crowded race, she added.
