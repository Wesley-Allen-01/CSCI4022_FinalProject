USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – The powerful donor network tied to free-market billionaire Charles Koch launched a new super PAC on Monday, beefing up its political arsenal ahead of November’s crucial midterm elections.

The Americans for Prosperity Action super PAC will allow the network to directly call for voters to defeat or elect specific candidates. The new super PAC is an arm of Koch’s long-standing grassroots wing, Americans for Prosperity, which operates in 36 states. But that group is a nonprofit and faces restrictions on its political activity.

Super PACs can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to influence candidate elections, so long as they don’t coordinate their spending decisions with the politicians they support.

The move comes after Koch officials clashed with President Donald Trump over his trade and immigration policies and warned Trump-aligned Republicans up for re-election this year not to take the network’s support for granted. Koch's aides call Trump's tariff's battles with China and other countries ""protectionism"" they say will hurt American businesses and consumers.

The feud widened when the Republican National Committee warned Republican donors – and GOP candidates who might use the Koch network’s in-house data program to reach voters – to stay away from the Kansas industrial magnate and his political operation.

In a statement about the new super PAC, Koch officials said they are ""committed to working with anyone to advance positive policies.""

Koch officials have not yet announced how much they will spend through the new political committee, but they previously said they were likely to expend up to $400 million over the two-year election cycle to help candidates and advance free-market policies.

Republicans are fighting to retain their majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, where Democrats need to flip 23 seats to seize the chamber.

Politico reported that the “ mysterious ” super PAC “ is making a late attempt to save her candidacy . ”
“ Combined with the $ 3.25 million Persist PAC already spent in Super Tuesday states along with $ 2 million in Nevada and South Carolina , the shadowy group has committed over $ 14 million to try to buoy Warren ’ s candidacy , ” the outlet reported . “ All together , Warren — who has made the corrupting influence of dark money central to her candidacy — now has the biggest super PAC advertising in the Super Tuesday states . ”
That ’ s a big swing from Warren ’ s previous stance on super PACs and dark money . As ███ previously reported , Warren said she was giving up her rejection of big-dollar donors because she couldn ’ t get her fellow Democrats to go along with her – a metaphor for her leadership skills if there ever was one .

That was Warren ’ s justification for now accepting super PAC money – and not just accepting it , but accepting a lot of it on her behalf .
“ Finally , we reached the point a few weeks ago where all of the men who were still in this race and on the debate stage all had either super PACs or they were multibillionaires and could just rummage around their sock drawers and find enough money to be able to fund a campaign , ” she said .

Although billionaire front-runner Donald Trump is self-financing his campaign and does not actively seek donations , the real estate tycoon took in more cash unsolicited than did some of his rivals who need donations to keep their campaigns running .
( Corrected paragraph : ) Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas , meanwhile , reported the most cash on hand .
Mr. Carson , a retired neurosurgeon , said he raised $ 20.7 million from July 1 through Sept. 30 , followed by Mr. Bush ’ s $ 13.4 million and Sen. Mr. Cruz ’ s $ 12.2 million haul , according to records filed Thursday with the Federal Election Commission .
Businesswoman Carly Fiorina raised about $ 7 million , Mr. Rubio raised $ 6 million , Ohio Gov . John Kasich collected $ 4.4 million and New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie brought in $ 4.2 million . Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky reported a $ 2.5 million haul as he fights to be included on the next debate ’ s main stage amid declining poll numbers .
“ We ’ re in it for the long haul , ” Mr. Paul insisted in an interview on CNN . “ We have planned and we have organized in all 50 states . I wouldn ’ t waste two years of my life trying to put this message out if I did not plan on being there when they voted , so we plan on being there when they vote . ”
His $ 2.5 million was a major drop from the $ 7 million he raised in the second quarter , which ran from April 1 to June 30 , but Mr. Paul said he has seen a surge in October and is comfortable with the $ 2 million in cash he had on hand .
But that $ 2.5 million take is less than what Mr. Trump raised with neither effort nor need .
The Trump campaign raised $ 3.9 million in the third quarter , not only more than Mr. Paul but also almost as much as Mr. Christie and Mr. Kasich . Mr. Trump received 73,942 unsolicited donations with an average contribution of $ 50.46 .
But the Trump campaign also spent $ 4 million from July 1 through Sept. 30 , a higher figure than some of his peers , albeit much less than Mr. Carson . For example , Mr. Kasich spent $ 1.7 million in the quarter , Mrs. Fiorina spent $ 2.2 million and Mr. Christie said he spent $ 2.8 million — all less than Mr. Trump .
Mr. Trump made a contribution of $ 100,779 to his campaign during the quarter , raising the amount he has personally spent since launching his campaign to $ 1,909,576 .
But for the others , the third-quarter report is a key midpoint test as donors and activists try to gauge who has the funding to stick it out .
“ We knew from the start this was going to be a hard fought and close race , but few could have anticipated just how volatile this field would be , ” Mr. Bush ’ s campaign manager , Danny Diaz , wrote in a letter to donors .
“ I — for one — would be less than forthcoming if I said we predicted in June that a reality television star supporting Canadian-style single-payer health care and partial-birth abortion would be leading the Republican Primary , ” he wrote .
Mr. Diaz assured donors that Mr. Bush would be “ better funded than any other in the entire field ” and that their campaign has a “ formidable grassroots organization in the early states . ”
Although his fundraising intake was respectable , Mr. Bush ended with $ 10.3 million in cash on hand , which lagged several of his competitors : Sen. Ted Cruz , with $ 13.5 million ; Mr. Carson , with $ 11.3 million ; and Mr. Rubio , with $ 11 million .
Mr. Rubio , who draws from the same Florida base of donors as Mr. Bush , was quick to highlight the difference .
“ Thanks to smart budgeting and fiscal discipline , Marco Rubio for president started October with more money in the bank than Jeb Bush for president and most other campaigns , ” according to a statement by Mr. Rubio ’ s campaign — put out six minutes after Mr. Bush ’ s announcement . “ Rubio ’ s FEC report details the lengths his campaign went to save money . ”
It goes on to list buying office furniture from Craigslist , taking cheap Uber rides and flying discount airliners such as Sprint and Frontier .
Mr. Bush has been criticized for running a costly campaign , complete with chartered flights and expensive hotels .
Surprisingly , one of the most frugal campaigns is associated with a name synonymous with opulence and high-class trimmings : Donald Trump .
According to the FEC filing , the Trump campaign showed frugality in his expenses , with roughly $ 320 spent for McDonald ’ s from Iowa to New Hampshire to Virginia . Staffers also frequented Wendy ’ s and Dairy Queen .
Their overnight stays were at the Comfort Inn and Courtyard by Marriott .
By contrast , while Mr. Carson raised the largest amount , his campaign also burned through $ 14 million in the third quarter , spending money on lavish dinners at Johnny ’ s Half Shell , an upscale Washington seafood restaurant , and stays at the swanky Waldorf Hotel in New York .
“ It is my great honor to be participating in this Presidential race , which has the possibility of having a truly great and positive impact on America , ” Mr. Trump said in a statement releasing his numbers . “ While our original budget was substantially higher than the amount spent , good business practices and even better ideas and policy have made it unnecessary to have spent a larger sum .
“ To be number one in every poll , both state and national , and to have spent the least amount of dollars of any serious candidate is a testament to what I can do for America . This is what our country ’ s leaders should do for the United States — spend money wisely and win ! ” Mr. Trump said .
Mr. Trump also financed all of his own events — large rallies that cost him thousands of dollars in setup and security , his filing shows .
He also recorded a $ 723,426 cost for Tag Air , a private jet and charter . Ironically , a man known to dominate the media paid $ 30,000 to Drake Ventures for communications consulting and shelled out $ 243 to Constant Contact for email marketing .
At the lower end , Louisiana Gov . Bobby Jindal has been fighting to be heard this election cycle , being put at the so-called “ kiddie table ” in the past two debates . He is betting that the $ 260,000 he has left in his coffers will take him to the finish line .
Mr. Jindal raised $ 579,000 in the third quarter but spent $ 832,000 , according to the latest FEC records . It was the smallest haul of all of the candidates , but his lean campaign had to spend the largest amount on payroll , at about $ 300,000 .
While Mr. Jindal has been polling at or about 1 percent nationally , his numbers have picked up in Iowa , which holds the first nominating contest . Mr. Jindal has vowed to stay in the race and is betting on winning Iowa in order to do so .
“ This is an election not an auction . We are running a lean mean campaign , ” Shannon Dirmann , a spokeswoman for the campaign , said in an email . “ We are tied for 5th right now in Iowa and plan to win it on February 1st . ”
Scott Walker , the Wisconsin governor who bowed out of the Republican presidential contest last month , ended the quarter with almost four times as much money as Mr. Jindal , having $ 985,213.43 cash on hand , according to his FEC release . Mr. Walker concluded the quarter with $ 161,133.45 in debt but indicated that it would be paid and donations returned .
The biggest driver of Mr. Walker ’ s campaign debt was staff salaries , which came in at about $ 2 million . Communications director Kirsten Kukowski , campaign manager Rick Wiley and director of operations Matt Hall each made an annual salary of more than $ 200,000 . Mr. Hall ’ s company , Harbinger LLC , also was paid $ 143,425 in August and September .

The officials didn ’ t reveal Buttigieg ’ s field-leading second-quarter fundraising total then , but what they did discuss is more important in the long run : how Buttigieg plans to spend the money .
For months , the South Bend , Ind. , mayor has run one of the more frugal 2020 campaigns , eschewing on-the-ground organizers in early caucus and primary states and instead focusing on fundraising , media appearances and the candidate ’ s travel . But Buttigieg is now rapidly expanding his campaign ’ s footprint to try and build on his gains in the first half of the year .
In Iowa , Buttigieg ’ s campaign added 30 organizers at the end of June , filling out what had previously been a four-person skeleton crew . A dozen staffers are now on board in New Hampshire . And by the end of the summer , there will be many more : The campaign plans to swell its staff to 300 people by Labor Day , according to multiple people briefed on its plans .

Before the first Democratic presidential debates kicked off last week, close to 100 Pete Buttigieg supporters and donors sheltered from the Miami heat in a Hilton hotel conference room, where Buttigieg’s senior staff briefed them on the campaign’s transformation from shoe-string operation to $25 million enterprise.

The officials didn’t reveal Buttigieg’s field-leading second-quarter fundraising total then, but what they did discuss is more important in the long run: how Buttigieg plans to spend the money.

For months, the South Bend, Ind., mayor has run one of the more frugal 2020 campaigns, eschewing on-the-ground organizers in early caucus and primary states and instead focusing on fundraising, media appearances and the candidate’s travel. But Buttigieg is now rapidly expanding his campaign’s footprint to try and build on his gains in the first half of the year.

In Iowa, Buttigieg’s campaign added 30 organizers at the end of June, filling out what had previously been a four-person skeleton crew. A dozen staffers are now on board in New Hampshire. And by the end of the summer, there will be many more: The campaign plans to swell its staff to 300 people by Labor Day, according to multiple people briefed on its plans.

“As we go into the summer toward the fall, we really need to make sure we’ve got the right kind of ground game. And part of that is how we use my time, and part of that is in between [events] making sure we’ve got folks day in and day out on the ground,” Buttigieg said during a recent campaign stop in Sioux City, Iowa. “So you’ll see the numbers of organizers and volunteers that we have really growing.”

Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg , billionaire Michael Bloomberg and Citigroup exec Carlos Gutierrez gave immigration reform firepower last year when they lent their money or names to the cause .
But roughly two months before Election Day , the three groups the business titans helped launch are all but silent on the campaign trail . None of the three has purchased airtime for ads on immigration reform this fall .
Their virtual absence comes as Senate Republican candidates in battleground states are launching attack ads against Democrats accusing them of supporting “ amnesty , ” leaving pro-immigration reform candidates even more vulnerable and immigration reform even less likely to happen .
Gutierrez ’ s group , Republicans for Immigration Reform , has no plans to launch a counteroffensive . Despite being billed as the GOP rainmaker on immigration reform , the group has struggled to make inroads with big GOP donors .
“ With the problem at the border and the president ’ s rhetoric on executive action have totally poisoned the well , ” said Charlie Spies , who helped organized Republicans for Immigration Reform . “ I don ’ t think anybody believes anything can happen this year . ”
They aren ’ t alone . While American Action Network was heavily invested in pushing immigration reform when legislation was under discussion in the Senate , the multi-issue conservative group isn ’ t active on the ground or on TV trying to make an example of House Republicans who have blocked similar efforts in that chamber .
Bloomberg ’ s Partnership for a New American Economy also has no plans for major network or cable TV ad buys on immigration reform .
Zuckerberg ’ s FWD.us could go up with ads later this fall , but doesn ’ t have any time reserved as of yet .
Representatives from the groups cite a variety of reasons for not playing an active role in the election — everything from immigration reform not being a top issue this cycle to trying to save limited resources for when the legislative environment in Congress becomes better .
Still , it ’ s a stark contrast from earlier this year when immigration groups , GOP operatives , unions and others were putting a full-court press on House Republicans with ads , private meetings and in district lobbying to engage on the issue .
Some groups fed up with Republicans became aggressive last year . Kica Matos , a spokeswoman for the Fair Immigration Reform Movement said earlier this year that it was time to “ switch tactics from persuasion to punishment . ”
Many hoped the big outside groups would pick up that mantle .
Sill , Republicans have moved increasingly to the right on the issue of immigration , following the dramatic surge of illegal immigrants on the Texas border . And they aren ’ t afraid to show it . Attack ads have aired in Arkansas , Michigan and New Hampshire — key states for which party will control the Senate . Failed Alaska tea party Republican Senate candidate Joe Miller , who was vying to become the GOP nominee , went so far as to send out a mailer that depicted illegal immigrants as gang members .
President Barack Obama has signaled he will use executive actions regarding immigration reform in mid-September . When he does , it ’ s expected to incite the barrage of criticism on the campaign trail from Republicans even more .
The Latino Victory Project is trying to provide a backstop for Obama . The group , which was supported by actress Eva Longoria and Democratic megadonor Henry Muñoz , is launching cable TV ads in English and Spanish to run in Washington through the beginning of September that criticize House Republican leadership ’ s failure to act on immigration reform . The group also plans to run digital ads in Iowa Republican Rep. Steve King ’ s district .
Latino Victory Project ’ s Cristobal Alex said they decided to go up with the ads because there was a “ vacuum ” on the pro-immigration reform side , and expects to do another round of ads once Obama takes executive action on the issue .
He praised the other pro-immigration groups activity so far , but said it would be “ unfortunate if they pulled back at this moment . ”
The Service Employees International Union has also been running radio ads in Colorado , California and Nevada focused on Latino voters and trying to hold Republicans accountable for blocking immigration reform .
There ’ s little expectation that other pro-reform groups will join the Latino Victory Project anytime soon .
“ We ’ re not a party committee on spending , ” said one operative involved with setting strategy . “ We have helped people on both sides of the aisle before who were getting pounded . ”
Another top operative said that while they haven ’ t cut ads proactively , if the opposition were to go after Republican lawmakers who have supported immigration reform like Rep. Renee Ellmers ( R-N.C. ) or Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R-S.C. ) on the issue they would come out in force .
Consultants and supporters of the groups say that they continue to be engaged , but attacking House GOP leadership over immigration reform is counterproductive .
It ’ s a stark contrast to the aggressive rollout groups like Gutierrez ’ s Republicans for Immigration Reform and Zuckerberg ’ s FWD.us enjoyed last year .
Gutierrez , a Cuban immigrant and a veteran of the immigration wars having served as President George W. Bush ’ s top official on the issue , was billed as the GOP ’ s immigration reform rainmaker .
Despite being able to raise unlimited money , Republicans for Immigration Reform has struggled to meet early fundraising expectations . In part , the group had a hard time just as many GOP outside groups did following the disappointing 2012 election results and with some large donors preferring to give to groups set up so their contributions remain undisclosed .
During the heat of the immigration fight in late 2013 , the group did put out a full-page newspaper ad , robocalls and some polling .
Gutierrez ’ s group has brought in just $ 308,000 this cycle , spending the majority of that haul on communications and fundraising consulting fees and legal bills . It has not done an ad buy in 2014 or put any money toward independent expenditures , according to Federal Election Commission records .
Silicon Valley-backed FWD.us has had no problem bringing in millions of dollars and over the past year has done the majority of paid media in support of immigration reform , cutting national ads and district specific ads to support lawmakers like Ellmers in the primary .
The group is not up with any TV ads right now .
FWD.us President Joe Green said the group has used paid media to highlight why immigration reform is needed .
“ Since we started , we have stood by our champions and used paid media as a way to tell the stories that highlight why we need immigration reform , ” Green said . “ As we have in the past , we will continue in the future to use a variety of tactics including ads to back up our champions and persuade lawmakers to finally fix our broken immigration system . ”
The conservative-backed American Action Network and Bloomberg ’ s Partnership for a New American Economy are also fairly quiet on immigration reform this fall .
American Action Network ’ s Dan Conston defended the group ’ s activity supporting immigration reform .
“ During the heat of the debate , AAN was incredibly engaged in trying to pass immigration reform , from air cover on TV to a ground game in districts to releasing polling , policy studies and more , ” Conston said in an email , noting the group spent $ 1 million on efforts that included five ad buys , grass tops outreach in 20 districts last August and releasing polls showing a way forward for passing reform in the House .
AAN did “ everything they could to support immigration reform but it simply doesn ’ t appear realistic this year , ” said a source close to the group . “ They ’ re not about to attack or pressure House leaders , but rather be there to support it if a real chance for immigration reform reemerges . ”
The Partnership for a New American Economy is doing selective ads featuring the role immigrants play in the high tech and agribusiness sectors in D.C. , taxi cabs and at Washington Dulles International and Reagan National airports . The group is also doing digital ads in movie theaters , state fairs and rodeos in 16 districts .
Jeremy Robbins said the group is looking to do spots where they think it will be useful , but are not focused on specific races or taking on any lawmakers .
“ Our strategy is not attacking opponents , ” Robbins said . “ We will become over the next couple of years targeted on specific races . ”","Their absence comes as Senate Republican candidates in battleground states launch attack ads. | AP Photos Billionaire immigration push slows

Sill, Republicans have moved increasingly to the right on the issue of immigration, following the dramatic surge of illegal immigrants on the Texas border. And they aren’t afraid to show it. Attack ads have aired in Arkansas, Michigan and New Hampshire — key states for which party will control the Senate. Failed Alaska tea party Republican Senate candidate Joe Miller, who was vying to become the GOP nominee, went so far as to send out a mailer that depicted illegal immigrants as gang members.

President Barack Obama has signaled he will use executive actions regarding immigration reform in mid-September. When he does, it’s expected to incite the barrage of criticism on the campaign trail from Republicans even more.

The Latino Victory Project is trying to provide a backstop for Obama. The group, which was supported by actress Eva Longoria and Democratic megadonor Henry Muñoz, is launching cable TV ads in English and Spanish to run in Washington through the beginning of September that criticize House Republican leadership’s failure to act on immigration reform. The group also plans to run digital ads in Iowa Republican Rep. Steve King’s district.

Not everyone is waving the white flag.

Latino Victory Project’s Cristobal Alex said they decided to go up with the ads because there was a “vacuum” on the pro-immigration reform side, and expects to do another round of ads once Obama takes executive action on the issue.

He praised the other pro-immigration groups activity so far, but said it would be “unfortunate if they pulled back at this moment.”

The Service Employees International Union has also been running radio ads in Colorado, California and Nevada focused on Latino voters and trying to hold Republicans accountable for blocking immigration reform.

There’s little expectation that other pro-reform groups will join the Latino Victory Project anytime soon.

“We’re not a party committee on spending,” said one operative involved with setting strategy. “We have helped people on both sides of the aisle before who were getting pounded.”

Another top operative said that while they haven’t cut ads proactively, if the opposition were to go after Republican lawmakers who have supported immigration reform like Rep. Renee Ellmers (R-N.C.) or Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) on the issue they would come out in force.

Consultants and supporters of the groups say that they continue to be engaged, but attacking House GOP leadership over immigration reform is counterproductive.

It’s a stark contrast to the aggressive rollout groups like Gutierrez’s Republicans for Immigration Reform and Zuckerberg’s FWD.us enjoyed last year.

Gutierrez, a Cuban immigrant and a veteran of the immigration wars having served as President George W. Bush’s top official on the issue, was billed as the GOP’s immigration reform rainmaker.

Despite being able to raise unlimited money, Republicans for Immigration Reform has struggled to meet early fundraising expectations. In part, the group had a hard time just as many GOP outside groups did following the disappointing 2012 election results and with some large donors preferring to give to groups set up so their contributions remain undisclosed.

During the heat of the immigration fight in late 2013, the group did put out a full-page newspaper ad, robocalls and some polling.

Gutierrez’s group has brought in just $308,000 this cycle, spending the majority of that haul on communications and fundraising consulting fees and legal bills. It has not done an ad buy in 2014 or put any money toward independent expenditures, according to Federal Election Commission records.

Silicon Valley-backed FWD.us has had no problem bringing in millions of dollars and over the past year has done the majority of paid media in support of immigration reform, cutting national ads and district specific ads to support lawmakers like Ellmers in the primary.

The group is not up with any TV ads right now.

FWD.us President Joe Green said the group has used paid media to highlight why immigration reform is needed.

“Since we started, we have stood by our champions and used paid media as a way to tell the stories that highlight why we need immigration reform,” Green said. “As we have in the past, we will continue in the future to use a variety of tactics including ads to back up our champions and persuade lawmakers to finally fix our broken immigration system.”

The conservative-backed American Action Network and Bloomberg’s Partnership for a New American Economy are also fairly quiet on immigration reform this fall.

American Action Network’s Dan Conston defended the group’s activity supporting immigration reform.

“During the heat of the debate, AAN was incredibly engaged in trying to pass immigration reform, from air cover on TV to a ground game in districts to releasing polling, policy studies and more,” Conston said in an email, noting the group spent $1 million on efforts that included five ad buys, grass tops outreach in 20 districts last August and releasing polls showing a way forward for passing reform in the House.

AAN did “everything they could to support immigration reform but it simply doesn’t appear realistic this year,” said a source close to the group. “They’re not about to attack or pressure House leaders, but rather be there to support it if a real chance for immigration reform reemerges.”

The Partnership for a New American Economy is doing selective ads featuring the role immigrants play in the high tech and agribusiness sectors in D.C., taxi cabs and at Washington Dulles International and Reagan National airports. The group is also doing digital ads in movie theaters, state fairs and rodeos in 16 districts.

Jeremy Robbins said the group is looking to do spots where they think it will be useful, but are not focused on specific races or taking on any lawmakers.

“Our strategy is not attacking opponents,” Robbins said. “We will become over the next couple of years targeted on specific races.”",www.politico.com,left,6r8NzTvyrHZ9JXhE

Clearly the only explanation for Jeb Bush's almost effortless stroll to the Republican nomination is the pernicious stranglehold of big money in politics.Oh, wait. Bush is in the low single digits in most national polls, despite his campaign and his super PAC raising more than $100 million. Perhaps that's only because Donald Trump, the billionaire populist, is buying the nomination with his dragon's hoard of gold? Well, no. Trump has spent less than any other major candidate.But surely Hillary Clinton, with her close ties to Wall Street, her husband's storied hobnobbing with the global .001 percent, not to mention her vast Rolodex of Clinton Inc. supporters going back four decades, has bought herself the nomination? It doesn't look that way, according to the polls. She's losing ground to Sen. Bernie Sanders in both Iowa and New Hampshire.Sanders has raised more money from small donors than any other candidate in American history. And he's done so by declaring nothing short of war on what he calls the ""billionaire class.""""I do not exaggerate when I tell you that the foundations of American democracy are being undermined,"" Sanders told some students at the University of Chicago (and pretty much anyone else he's ever talked to). ""American democracy is not supposed to be about billionaires buying elections.""You'd think that if the ""billionaire class"" — all 536 people — had the kind of unfettered control over the U.S. political system Sanders believes them to have, he would be asking, Would you like fries with that?Instead, he's got a plausible, if not yet entirely probable, shot at the Democratic presidential nomination. And even if he doesn't emerge victorious, he's already dragged Clinton to the left on the issues the billionaires are supposed to care about.And Trump, widely disliked among his fellow billionaires. at least the Republican ones, has had remarkable success demonizing his wealthy peers.The simple fact is that almost everywhere you look, the super-rich are being stymied by democracy. In 2014, David Brat, an unknown academic, defeated the second most powerful Republican in Congress, then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, even though Cantor spent more money on steak dinners than Brat did on his whole campaign.The recent referendum on marijuana legalization in Ohio was lavishly funded — and failed. Just a reminder: Barack Obama beat Mitt Romney and his plutocrat pals.Those evil corporations aren't faring much better. We constantly hear about their vise grip on Washington, yet we still have the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world (not counting United Arab Emirates). Big corporations rightly want to be able to repatriate their profits earned overseas without being taxed on them again. (Most countries allow corporations to pay taxes on profits solely in the jurisdictions where they were earned.) And yet they can't get it done.Even the dreaded Koch Brothers, those supposed supervillains, have failed to buy the policies they prefer. And yet, to listen to countless pundits and politicians, we live in an oligarchy now.Clinton, who benefits from no less than five super PACs, thinks the Citizens United case, which made super PACs possible, is such a threat to democracy that the First Amendment should be rewritten to get rid of them.Democrats don't like Citizens United because they think it might blunt their advantages. According to OpenSecrets.org, of the top five organizations — i.e., unions and corporate PACs — that give to federal candidates, all (mostly public unions) give 97 percent to 100 percent of their donations to liberals and Democrats. Of the top 10, 8 give almost exclusively to the left. Of the top 25, 18 donate disproportionately to the left.By the way, Koch Industries is No. 49 on the list, and the National Rifle Association is No. 74.One can certainly understand why average citizens find this ""billionaire class"" stuff plausible. Government certainly has become more and more unresponsive and aloof. (Public sector unions are a big reason why.) And it is obviously true that big money, variously defined, plays a significant role in our politics.But you know what plays a bigger role? Politics. The NRA is a good case in point. President Obama insists that the ""gun lobby"" owns Congress, which is why he can't get the gun-control policies he wants passed. The truth, however, is that politicians care more about votes than money, and if they follow his advice, they'll also follow so many Democrats who were fired for agreeing with Obama.That's actually how democracy is supposed to work.",www.newsmax.com,right,cWAOCIaiJ4Omvqvi

I asked 11 legal experts.,2018-05-03,"Sean Illing, Terry Nguyen, Tara Golshan, Mark Dent, Theodore Schleifer, Emily Todd Vanderwerff","Newly appointed Donald Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani dropped a bombshell on Wednesday night when he said on Fox News that Trump had repaid his attorney Michael Cohen for $ 130,000 in Stormy Daniels hush money .
Even Sean Hannity , who was interviewing Giuliani , seemed surprised by the admission . It was a shocking moment because it contradicted Trump ’ s previous claim that he didn ’ t know anything about Cohen ’ s payment .
The secret payment to the porn actress to keep an alleged affair quiet was already a potential legal problem for Trump because it may have violated campaign finance laws . If Trump knew about the payment , and if it was designed to help the campaign and it wasn ’ t properly disclosed , then it ’ s illegal .
Before last night ’ s revelation , the big question was whether the Daniels payment was technically campaign-related , or if it was merely personal . If it ’ s the former , Trump is in trouble . And if the payment was made without Trump ’ s knowledge , then he would be off the hook .
But now we know , thanks to Giuliani , that Trump did know about it — and Trump later confirmed Giuliani ’ s account on Twitter .
So what does the legal picture look like for Trump now ? To find out , I reached out to 11 legal experts . Their responses , edited for clarity , are below .
Giuliani has made things much worse for Trump . First , he ’ s confirmed that Trump repaid the money , meaning Cohen potentially made an unreported loan to the campaign . If this was campaign-related , and Trump failed to report the loan and the repayments of the loan , that is a campaign finance violation . And willful violations can lead to criminal liability . Much turns on Trump ’ s motive . On Fox News , Giuliani suggested Trump ’ s motivation was indeed campaign-related .
Rudy Giuliani ’ s recent comments in interviews seem both unhinged and unhelpful . And in typical fashion , the Trump team appears to be doubling down on his claims in the aftermath . At a minimum , Giuliani has flatly contradicted the president ’ s earlier statements and exposed his arrangement with Cohen .
More dangerously , the awkward theory of “ reimbursement ” via retainer fees over time does not solve the problem of an illegal campaign contribution in 2016 .
It ’ s easy to argue that when Michael Cohen used $ 130,000 of his own money to pay Stormy Daniels not to reveal her affair with then-candidate Trump , that payment was made for a campaign purpose .
The reasoning is fairly straightforward : The payment was made to help Trump ’ s campaign because if Daniels revealed the affair , that would hurt the campaign . So Giuliani ’ s argument that Trump reimbursed Cohen doesn ’ t hold up if the payment was still , ultimately , designed to help the campaign .
This argument is bolstered by the possibility that the Trump campaign is paying Michael Cohen ’ s legal fees because the payment Cohen made to Daniels was related to the campaign .
So if the payment was indeed made for a campaign purpose , then it is a loan to the campaign , and that is something which must be disclosed and reported to the Federal Election Commission . President Trump would also need to disclose and report the repayment . Failure to report such a loan could be considered to be a false statement .
Also , if Trump was repaying Cohen in increments of less than $ 10,000 to avoid reporting to the Treasury Department , this could be a violation of federal banking laws . It ’ s called “ illegal structuring , ” and it ’ s the same crime that Dennis Hastert was convicted of in 2016 .
Giuliani was not going off script . This was a deliberate strategy by Trump and his lawyers , now that they know Mueller and the Southern District of New York have the financial records and that Cohen is probably going to flip — to admit and spin . The problem is that these admissions open up even more legal trouble .
Before last night , Trump ’ s official story isolated Cohen for campaign finance and bank fraud felonies . Now , Trump is on the hook for failing to disclose campaign donations and debts and for conspiring to evade detection with deliberately small reimbursements , as Giuliani said , “ funneled through a law firm. ” That ’ s the language a prosecutor , not a defense attorney , would use to explain illegal activity .
One overlooked point : Giuliani also strengthened the case for obstruction of justice when Trump fired [ FBI Director James ] Comey . The official reason was based on Comey ’ s handling of Clinton ’ s email . Of course , Trump already told [ NBC News anchor ] Lester Holt and Russian diplomats that the real reason was the Russia investigation .
We know Trump told Comey to “ let go ” of [ Michael ] Flynn while admitting that he knew Flynn had lied to the FBI . But Giuliani further confirmed this corrupt purpose when he said on Fox News that Trump “ fired Comey because Comey would not say that he wasn ’ t a target of the investigation . He ’ s entitled to that . Hillary Clinton got that . And he couldn ’ t get that . So he fired him . And then he said , ‘ I ’ m free of this , guys. ’ ” This is one more piece of evidence of “ corrupt intent , ” the mental state required by federal obstruction statutes .
Giuliani ’ s comments appear to be part of a strategy to help Michael Cohen , who is under investigation for campaign finance violations relating to the Stormy Daniels payment .
Giuliani ’ s statements open Trump up to new liability for campaign finance violations and potentially for submitting a false financial disclosure form . Giuliani and Trump are betting that the public won ’ t care , and Congress won ’ t impeach for these potential violations , while Cohen remains in the fold . All of this begs the question : What does Michael Cohen know ? He must know something important to warrant this kind of exposure from Giuliani and Trump .
The $ 130,000 payment to Stormy could violate campaign finance laws in a number of ways . If the donation is deemed to be a contribution to the candidacy of Mr. Trump , then it is way too big . At most , Mr. Cohen could give $ 2,700 to Mr. Trump ’ s campaign for the general election . It also appears to be an unreported contribution , which is another violation .
Finally , the use of this $ 130,000 could also violate prohibitions on personal use of campaign funds by a federal candidate . The rule of thumb with personal use is federal candidates can only use campaign funds for campaign expenditures . Candidates can ’ t do the equivalent of pocketing campaign money or using it to pay for personal things like divorce lawyers .
What Giuliani ’ s admission to Hannity did is provide evidence that Trump had knowledge of the $ 130,000 payment , which opens the door not just to legal problems for Mr. Cohen , but also to potential legal problems for Trump .
There is no serious criminal case against Trump for a campaign finance violation relating to the Daniels payoff . It would , at most , be a technical violation that no sane prosecutor would base criminal charges on ( assuming that such charges could be brought against the president ) .
Although I have zero sympathy for Trump , I am puzzled by the CNN and MSNBC pundits ’ apparent unanimity that Giuliani ’ s statement that Trump reimbursed Cohen was an admission that Trump lied , when he previously said he had not known of the Daniels payoff . There is no necessary contradiction here .
Trump ’ s story now is that he knew nothing about the payoff when it occurred , but since it was made on his behalf by his lawyer , he felt obliged to reimburse Cohen for the payment . If in fact Trump reimbursed Cohen , that could only have been hidden for a short time before becoming undeniable . I don ’ t believe that Giuliani did Trump any serious harm in revealing the reimbursement .
Giuliani seemed to enjoy his chats with Fox News on Wednesday evening and Thursday morning . Even apart from the unseemly spectacle of watching your lawyer speculate about the state of your marriage on national television , no client would want his or her lawyer to highlight even more questions relating to more money from unidentified sources , thereby fueling even more speculation about a payment made shortly before election day .
What did Giuliani mean by his reference to money having been “ funneled ” through a law firm ? Why were reimbursements made in $ 35,000 increments over time ?
Giuliani told American voters that $ 130,000 was such a small , insignificant sum that his client could have paid it from his own funds at any time . So why didn ’ t he do so ? There was , apparently , far more money than $ 130,000 involved , perhaps an amount approaching $ 500,000 . Where did this come from ? What was it used for ? What path did it take ?
All of this creates new interest in previous suggestions of a fund used to deal with unfortunate behavior by Trump . The only thing Giuliani ’ s narrative lacked was an express reference to one or more exempt entities providing nondisclosure and a tax deduction .
Perhaps if we stay tuned , Giuliani will tell us about this as well .
The importance of Giuliani ’ s admission of repayment is that it indicates Trump and his campaign had knowledge of Cohen ’ s hush payment on Trump ’ s behalf . Cohen ’ s hush payment , for purposes of campaign finance law , might have been a contribution to the Trump campaign even if it were a loan .
The Trump campaign would have been required to disclose such a contribution . Giuliani ’ s admission therefore suggests that Trump and his campaign willfully failed to disclose it , which could trigger criminal liability under campaign finance law . Having said all that , the case against Trump for willful failure to disclose is still not a complete slam-dunk .
The circumstances and context here are suspicious , but it is not entirely clear that Cohen ’ s hush payment in fact constitutes a campaign finance contribution . Cohen and Giuliani seem still to maintain that the hush payment was purely personal , not campaign-related , which remains a gray area in campaign finance law .
Giuliani ’ s admission , though , concedes that Cohen did not act on his own and acted with Trump ’ s understanding . This not only contradicts Trump ’ s earlier positions but also opens the door wider for suspicions about obstruction of justice and use of Trump Organization resources in facilitating these transactions , among other things .
Giuliani ’ s comments are obviously inconsistent with what has come before . If the history of this presidency is a guide , then the latest rendition will last only a few news cycles before it too is clarified into some new version . All this is exhausting , dispiriting , and bizarre . But it is not illegal . Presidential confabulation may offend or not , but it is not constrained by law as such .
Now that we know President Trump authorized the payment during the campaign period , legal questions do emerge , despite all the “ nothing to see here ” pronouncements . There are many reasons to suspect that the finances and persona of Trump the individual and Trump the candidate were intertwined , just as the separation between the executive branch and the Trump administration has been anything but airtight .
An expenditure of this size at the heart of the campaign raises immediate questions of where the money came from and how it got paid . Legally , it makes a difference if it came from Trump himself , or from some private fund of contributions from friends . It makes a difference if the payment through Cohen was funneled through the campaign or privately .
Giuliani created some problems in acknowledging the money trail leads to Trump . “ Follow the money ” is always a useful guide . But whether this particular version of events is meaningful , or even around after a day or two , remains to be determined .
Last night ’ s revelation by Giuliani changes the political landscape much more than the legal one . The central legal question has not changed : When Michael Cohen wired $ 130,000 to Stephanie Clifford , was he trying to prevent Melania from learning about Clifford ’ s allegations or trying to prevent voters in Michigan from hearing these allegations ?
Trump ’ s acknowledgment that he was personally involved in the payment may actually help his legal argument . I think the defense that this was about protecting Trump ’ s marriage would be very weak if Michael Cohen had acted alone . Why would Cohen care about Melania ’ s perception of Trump more than Trump himself ? The Melania defense is much stronger now .
Politically , however , the president of the United States has acknowledged paying hush money to a porn actress and acknowledged that he knowingly and willfully lied to the press when asked about it .","Author’s note: These responses were given on May 3, 2018, shortly after President Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani admitted that Trump repaid his personal attorney Michael Cohen for $130,000 in hush money given to porn actress Stormy Daniels. On Tuesday, CNN released a secret recording between Cohen and Trump in which they discuss a similar payout to former Playboy model, Karen McDougal, who also claims she had an affair with Trump. The question in May was the same as it is today: Did Trump violate campaign finance laws by approving large payments to Daniels and McDougal in order to benefit his presidential campaign?

Newly appointed Donald Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani dropped a bombshell on Wednesday night when he said on Fox News that Trump had repaid his attorney Michael Cohen for $130,000 in Stormy Daniels hush money.

Even Sean Hannity, who was interviewing Giuliani, seemed surprised by the admission. It was a shocking moment because it contradicted Trump’s previous claim that he didn’t know anything about Cohen’s payment.

Trump’s campaign did have such specialized counsel, a team of election lawyers from Jones Day led by Don McGahn, who would go on to serve as White House counsel.

Justice Department policy is not to indict a sitting president, but some legal experts have said Trump could be charged after leaving office. Democrats and other critics also have raised the issue of impeachment by Congress.

Trump has denied the affairs. He has also denied the main focus of the investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller: whether his campaign colluded with Moscow in its meddling in the 2016 campaign. The Kremlin has denied that any meddling occurred.

Trump has routinely blasted the Mueller investigation as a “witch hunt.”

Mueller referred the Cohen prosecution to federal prosecutors in New York earlier this year.

Prosecutors on Wednesday also said the publisher of the National Enquirer tabloid had struck a deal to avoid charges over its role in one of the payments made “in concert” with Trump’s presidential campaign.

Cohen, who also pleaded to tax evasion and lying to Congress about a proposed Trump Organization building in Moscow, in court on Wednesday said his “blind loyalty” led him to cover up for Trump.

Cohen is the latest Trump associate to be swept up in Mueller’s investigation following Trump’s campaign chairman Paul Manafort, former deputy campaign chairman Rick Gates and former national security adviser Michael Flynn, among others.

In an interview with Reuters this week, Trump slammed Cohen for cooperating with prosecutors and said he was unconcerned about possible impeachment. He also called any of his potential business dealings with Russia “peanut stuff.” [nL1N1YH067]",www.reuters.com,center,Lsi5QLVby6VRafMV

At the core of the complaint is the tenuous distinction between Bloomberg ’ s personal finances and those of his presidential campaign . The complaint is unique because of the nature of Bloomberg 's self-funded campaign . He took no outside donations and maintained complete control over the campaign 's finances , and the complaint argues this weakens the legal distinctions normally found between campaign cash and a candidate 's personal wealth .

Bloomberg ’ s ill-fated foray into the 2020 presidential race saw him spend more than $ 900 million of his own money , according to FEC filings . After he suspended his campaign and endorsed Joe Biden , Bloomberg announced he ’ d be transferring $ 18 million to the DNC and the campaign ’ s field offices to state Democratic parties . The complaint alleges that both far exceed FEC limits on campaign contributions .

Backer , who has filed several FEC complaints and subsequent lawsuits against prominent Democratic politicians , said he expects the board members to agree with his assessment of Bloomberg ’ s contribution to the DNC .
“ If you allow Bloomberg to do this , you ’ re giving democracy to a billionaire oligarch , ” Backer said . “ … Having been unable to buy voters , he ’ s doing the next best thing and buying the party itself . ”
Despite a number of attempts to contact several members of Bloomberg ’ s campaign team , they declined to provide comment to Fox News .
In response to a detailed list of questions , the DNC referred Fox News to two tweets by their communications director , Xochitl Hinojosa . In one tweet about Bloomberg ’ s transfer , she said his contribution is different because his candidacy was “ in earnest ” and that a candidate “ moving money just to transfer to a party doesn ’ t pass the smell test . ”
Hinojosa also said the money would help the party to scale up its Battleground Build-Up 2020 initiative and hire more organizers . Both of which are explicitly mentioned in Bloomberg ’ s March 20 memo to DNC Chairman Tom Perez .
“ We hope this investment will dramatically expand the DNC ’ s Battleground Build-Up 2020 efforts across battleground states , drawing in part from our own incredibly experienced and talented organizing staff , ” the memo read .
By deciding to transfer the $ 18 million to the DNC , Bloomberg reneged on a plan to employ his campaign organizers through November by forming a Super PAC .

But Hill, ActBlue’s executive director, noted that the pool of Democratic small-dollar donors, which exploded in size in 2018, could still grow.

Sixty percent of ActBlue’s donors in the 2018 cycle were first-time givers, Hill said. “There’s no ceiling on this.”

The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.

America had just elected a Democratic president. The Senate was majority-Democratic. The House of Representatives had more Democrats than at any time since 1992.

The Republicans could either change themselves -- by embracing the young, diverse and tolerant America of the 21st century -- or they could try to change whose voices count in our democracy.

We all know the cynical path they chose. Six years ago Thursday, the Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United transformed our politics by allowing corporations to spend unlimited amounts of money to influence elections.

The effect was immediate. In the 2010 midterms, outside groups spent nearly 60% more than in 2006. In 2014, the top 100 donors spent nearly as much as all 4.75 million small donors combined. National networks of big-money donors funneled mountains of cash into targeted state races. By 2014, one party controlled both the governor's mansion and the state legislature in 36 states -- the most since the 1950s.

Restricting voting rights

Meanwhile, Republicans launched an aggressive campaign to restrict voting rights across the country. After the 2010 election, lawmakers in 41 states introduced at least 180 measures designed to make it harder for people to vote. This ugly effort got a boost in 2013 when the Supreme Court made another disastrous ruling, striking down hard-won Voting Rights Act protections. Today, 21 states have new laws restricting voting rights.

And some of the greatest damage to voting rights has come in states with single-party control -- like North Carolina, which eliminated same-day voter registration and slashed early voting; Florida, which instituted such heavy restrictions on voter registration drives that the League of Women Voters had to shut down operations; and Alabama, which passed a strict photo ID requirement and then closed dozens of driver's license offices across the state, making it much harder for citizens to get the IDs they now need to vote.

Put it all together -- the flood of corporate money in our elections, the rise of single-party control of state governments, the sharp increase in voting-rights restrictions -- and the result is unmistakable. Our democracy is being hollowed out. And that should offend every American, no matter what party you belong to.

Reclaim our democracy

We can't let this continue. It's time to reclaim our democracy, reform our distorted campaign finance system and restore access to the ballot box in all 50 states.

That starts with reversing Citizens United. And that's where my comprehensive plan to restore common sense to campaign finance begins. As president, I'll appoint Supreme Court justices who recognize that Citizens United is bad for America. And if necessary, I'll fight for a constitutional amendment that overturns it.

Meanwhile, we need more transparency in our politics. In the last three elections, more than $600 million in donations came from unknown, untraceable sources. That's a lot of secret, unaccountable money. As president, I'll require federal contractors to fully disclose their political spending. I'll call on the Securities and Exchange Commission to require that publicly traded companies do the same. And I'll fight for legislation requiring the disclosure of all significant political donations, no matter where they come from or who they benefit. Whether you're a Democrat or a Republican, you should have to identify your donors.

We should also make it easier for Americans to run for elected office. You shouldn't have to be rich or well-connected to serve. I'll fight to create a robust small-donor matching system, so people with good ideas and a passion for public service know that they can run without having to court big donors and special interests.

Make it easier to vote

Finally, we have to do a much better job of protecting Americans' voting rights. Nothing is more vital to our democracy. I'll fight to restore the full protections of the Voting Rights Act . And I'll go further, because we should be making it easier to vote, not harder.

All Americans should be automatically registered to vote on their 18th birthdays, unless they opt out. Every state should have at least 20 days of early in-person voting. And no one should ever have to wait more than 30 minutes to cast a ballot.

Citizens United and its aftermath have twisted and perverted our democratic system. Now the deck is stacked even more in favor of those at the top. But as Al Smith, another Democrat from New York, once said, ""All the ills of democracy can be cured by more democracy."" So that's what we need now: more transparency, more accountability, and above all, more citizens exercising their right to vote.

This November, we can show Republicans that they made the wrong choice eight years ago. Let's restore people's voices and people's votes to their rightful place -- at the center of our democracy.",www.cnn.com,left,dPwKauf6CiP9M1LX

“I don’t take kindly to threats, and I know my Republican friends don’t, either,” he wrote. “This email doesn’t exactly make me reach for my wallet and doesn’t do much to endear me to them.”

Still, Stivers defended the tone of the emails.

“The reason the DCCC does things that are annoying is cause it works,” the Republican said. “And we want to try to push things a little bit but not be as annoying as they are if we can.”

The GOP declined to release details about how much money they’ve raised online compared with other methods. Their federal campaign disclosures also don’t distinguish between email, direct mail and other fundraising tools.

Despite the DCCC’s success, there are rumblings of discontent among some in the party about the alarmist tone and volume of the email solicitations.

“I have a lot of respect for what the DCCC has been able to do,” said Neil Sroka, a former 2008 Obama digital campaign aide and now communications director for the Howard Dean-affiliated PAC Democracy for America. “But there’s a concern that with this churn through email addresses whether or not they’re forgetting that there are people on the other end of them.”

Rep. Jim Moran (D-Va.) acknowledged it can sometimes be a bit much.

“Many of my friends get at least one a day,” he said. “They hesitate to hit the delete button, but they understand they’d be dead broke if they responded to every appeal. And after a while, I do think the urgency of these appeals begins to ebb just a bit.”

But without the Democrats’ email fundraising efforts, Moran said the party would lose seats in the midterms.

“As long as it works,” he said, “it’s going to continue.”",www.politico.com,left,dxzVP2lZfLK79dvO

Mind the Gap , a network formed less than two years ago , has been quietly routing millions of dollars to Democratic candidates and groups across the country in the 2018 and 2020 election cycles , emerging as a new power center in the Silicon Valley political scene . It ’ s just that so far , it has avoided public detection .
The group ’ s success is due in large part to how it speaks the language of Silicon Valley , donors and operatives say : In 2018 , Mind the Gap pitched donors on a statistical model that tried to assess the precise impact of each additional dollar on the chance that Democrats would win the House of Representatives — as opposed to funding the easiest seats to flip . It ’ s an approach one donor called the “ Moneyball of politics . ”
That supposed secret sauce has ushered in more than $ 20 million in new political spending from tech leaders and others who are grappling with how to best use their wealth in the age of Donald Trump , according to Mind the Gap ’ s claims in materials seen by Recode . And the group has proven to be yet another way for Silicon Valley donors to spread their influence across the US at a time when many in the Democratic Party want to see Big Tech ’ s power abated rather than expanded .
Mind the Gap , whose efforts haven ’ t previously been reported , has recently petitioned some donors for at least $ 100,000 to support its efforts . Backers include people like Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz , former Google CEO Eric Schmidt , San Francisco power broker Ron Conway , and a coterie of major Democratic donors from across Silicon Valley , including fundraiser Amy Rao .
There are many middlemen on the left who have tried to take advantage of Silicon Valley ’ s new political energy . But few are proving to be as unusual as Mind the Gap , in both its message and its personnel .
The group operates in a cone of secrecy , often exhorting its donors to keep their information secure . It has no website or presence on social media , and its leaders don ’ t mention their involvement in their professional biographies on sites like LinkedIn . That ’ s not by accident .
“ The raison d ’ être is stealth , ” one person with ties to the organization told Recode .
A core strategy of Mind the Gap has been to hide which candidates and groups it is backing until it ’ s too late , so to speak . Republicans closely watch Democratic donors to see which congressional races they are financing so they can mobilize their own donors to restore fundraising parity in a particular congressional district . So Mind the Gap ’ s game plan has been to escape a bidding war by having its donors begin shoveling money behind Democrats only in the fall of an election season — sometimes all on the same day — before Republicans have a chance to notice that they are soon to be outspent by Democrats ( and then try to catch up ) .
That means Mind the Gap has been covert about which campaigns it is directing donors to support . In fact , some candidates who have been overwhelmed with donations from rich Silicon Valley types sometimes don ’ t even know they ’ re on the list , according to one donor who discussed the matter with a bewildered candidate .
What is also unusual is that Mind the Gap is led not by highly experienced political hands , but by academics with no professional backgrounds as fundraisers . The group ’ s leaders are a pair of Stanford law professors : Barbara Fried , who has no apparent campaign experience , and Paul Brest , the former president of the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation . Graham Gottlieb , a Stanford fellow who served in junior roles for former President Barack Obama ’ s 2012 reelection campaign and in his White House , is its executive director .
Fried declined to answer specific questions from Recode about Mind the Gap ’ s efforts , past or present . But in a statement , she downplayed the organization as merely a “ pro-bono donor advisor to people who are interested in evidence-driven decision making . ”
“ Most people have no idea whether their political contributions will actually make a difference , ” Fried said . “ Our aim is to evaluate the efficacy of different forms of political and civic engagement , and provide our conclusions free to individual , interested donors so they can make more educated decisions about where their money would be most effectively spent . ”
Working with a well-regarded Democratic data firm , Civis Analytics , and with early support from progressive mainstays like the AFL-CIO , Mind the Gap pitched donors in 2018 on a counterintuitive message to successfully take back the House : Don ’ t fund the congressional races that are the likeliest to flip . Those are already overfunded . Instead , fund the slightly less likely to flip races ( say , ones in which a Democrat might have a one-third chance of winning ) and where each donor dollar is more likely to make a difference — an “ efficient funding ” model , as Mind the Gap ’ s leaders called it .
“ Democrats face a serious funding-efficiency gap : We are on track to significantly overfund many of the races perceived to be the ‘ most flippable , ’ and at the same time , underfund races that could be won if we invested in them , ” reads one Mind the Gap memo from summer 2018 that Recode obtained . “ To put it another way , most donors invest based on the perceived winnability of a race , rather than the difference their investment in the race will make to the outcome . ”
That kind of pitch is catnip to people in Silicon Valley , who like to pride themselves on data-driven thinking .
The group set out to raise $ 10 million in the 2018 election cycle by convincing as many as 400 donors to give $ 2,700 each ( the legal maximum ) to as many as 20 different congressional candidates , according to the same memo . Mind the Gap ’ s fundraising drive ended up doubling those figures .
“ It felt like a silver bullet , and that ’ s how they marketed it , ” the person affiliated with Mind the Gap told Recode , characterizing the group ’ s thinking as : “ We have figured out a way to game the system . ”
Wealthy people from tech attracted by the vernacular of risk and return flocked to the group , packing donor briefings at ritzy spots in San Francisco ’ s Pacific Heights neighborhood and sharing the endorsement list with their friends across the tech industry . Those donors then flooded Democratic challengers like Xochitl Torres Small in New Mexico and Lauren Underwood in Illinois with as much as $ 640,000 in high-dollar donations . Mind the Gap “ infused into their campaigns almost overnight ” an average of more than $ 500,000 each , according to a separate , year-in-review memo distributed to donors last month and obtained by Recode .
Some of these candidates had as little as $ 65,000 on hand before Mind the Gap arrived .
By the end of the election cycle , Mind the Gap had convinced 800 people to support its efforts and funneled $ 11 million to Democratic candidates , according to Mind the Gap ’ s internal figures seen by Recode , and another $ 9 million to Democratic groups . Ten of its 20 candidates , such as Torres Small and Underwood , won their races .
“ They are incredibly grateful to you all , and many attribute their victory ( rightly or wrongly ) to MTG ’ s efforts , “ the group told its donors in one memo .
Now , in advance of what ’ s expected to be the most expensive presidential race ever , Mind the Gap is trying to bring that same thinking to the 2020 election , soliciting donors to sink millions of dollars into a trio of groups focused on voter registration and preparing to recommend more candidates later this year .
“ Anything could happen between now and next November to change the picture significantly . But we have no control over most of the things that will happen , ” the group told donors in its year-end memo last month . “ As ever , the question for us is , what can we influence , and where will money make the biggest difference ? ”","A secretive group led by Stanford University academics has unleashed millions of dollars in political spending from Silicon Valley and is now convincing some of its biggest donors to spend millions more to back Democrats in 2020.

Among those on the sidelines : Sheldon Adelson , the billionaire casino mogul who hosted the Republican Jewish Coalition ’ s spring meeting at his Venetian hotel this weekend . His apparent ambivalence about 2016 was shared by many RJC members here . With grave doubts about the viability of the few remaining Republican contenders , many of these Republican donors have decided to sit out the rest of the primary entirely . And while some are reluctantly getting behind a remaining candidate , others are shifting their attention to congressional contests .
On Friday morning , during a meeting of the group ’ s board , Arthur Finkelstein , an iconic Republican strategist who has advised numerous politicians over the past four decades , presented polling data that showed Donald Trump sitting at historically low approval numbers among American Jews , according to three attendees who described the off-the-record meeting . Ted Cruz , despite an aggressive recent push to court Jews , fared little better .
Following the nearly 30-minute presentation , the group turned to a discussion about what ’ s next in the race . While some in the room spoke in favor of Cruz , others expressed reservations about his prospects in the general election . Trump , meanwhile , had little support : Not one person volunteered to raise money for him if he were the nominee .
Over the course of the weekend , some of the party ’ s disappointed and most sought-after contributors said they may be done with the 2016 race . Mel Sembler , a Florida real estate executive and former U.S. ambassador , said that after helping to bankroll Jeb Bush ’ s campaign , he had turned his attention to defeating a local medical-marijuana initiative .
“ That ’ s my focus for the rest of this year , ” he said .
Easily the biggest holdout , though , is Adelson . Despite spending more than $ 100 million on the 2012 campaign — some of it on former House Speaker Newt Gingrich ’ s unsuccessful primary effort that year — the 82-year-old mogul has yet to pick a favorite 2016 candidate . His advisers say that he will not endorse anyone until the Republican nomination is decided , at the earliest .
Adelson , an unpredictable and enigmatic figure who is the 22nd richest person in the world , has offered few hints about how he ’ ll try to influence the campaign . While the RJC spring meeting is traditionally a celebration of Adelson , with politicians of all stripes venturing to the Venetian to pay homage , this year ’ s was different .
On Thursday evening , Adelson hosted some of the organization ’ s top officials at his palatial mansion . While former Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper discussed how fractured parties can unite , Adelson listened but said little , according to three people who were present . And on Friday , rather than preside over the deliberations , Adelson and his wife , Miriam , departed for a wedding .
The lack of interest is partly rooted in exhaustion . After watching many of the party ’ s establishment prospects — from Scott Walker to Marco Rubio — go up in flames , many top donors say they ’ ve simply grown tired of opening their wallets . Some here have given to multiple candidates , only to watch them suffer defeat .
“ Burnout ’ s real . People spent a lot of time and energy traveling on their own nickel , asking friends for money from different candidates . There ’ s only so many times you can go back to the well , ” said Jay Zeidman , a Texas executive who has thrown his support to Cruz after initially backing Jeb Bush .
For some who ’ ve watched their favored hopeful go down , the idea of getting behind someone else is almost unthinkable .
“ It ’ s tough . Jeb was such a good candidate , ” said Ronald Krongold , a Florida real estate investor and Bush friend and golfing partner who for years shared office space with him . “ He was such the guy that should have been president that the people who backed him are still confused .

On Friday morning, during a meeting of the group’s board, Arthur Finkelstein, an iconic Republican strategist who has advised numerous politicians over the past four decades, presented polling data that showed Donald Trump sitting at historically low approval numbers among American Jews, according to three attendees who described the off-the-record meeting.

But if he really hopes to romp over the eventual Democratic nominee , he ’ ll probably need markets to keep popping and growth to bubble higher , especially in the industrial Midwest . And it is far from obvious how the United States can get there from here .
“ I don ’ t think we are going to see growth reaccelerate in 2020 , ” said Mark Zandi , chief economist at Moody ’ s Analytics . “ The trade truce takes the recession risk off the table for now , but it ’ s not enough to propel stronger growth . If it ’ s a 2 percent economy , then all else being equal — and it ’ s a typical turnout — Trump will probably win . But if there ’ s strong Democratic turnout , especially in manufacturing states with weaker economies , those states will probably flip . ”
The White House and the rest of the GOP , of course , take a very different view .
They see the China deal and U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement as rocket boosters and predict a breakout in previously stalled capital spending and manufacturing , driving Trump to a “ Morning in America ” Electoral College blowout that keeps former Blue Wall Midwestern states firmly in his column . They also talk up what will certainly be a Tax Cuts 2.0 plan Trump will roll out some time next year as a tantalizing treat with no chance of becoming law in 2020 .
“ As long as there is no recession , I think Trump is in good shape — and if growth is stronger he ’ s in really good shape , ” said Stephen Moore , a conservative economist and outside adviser to the president . “ I think we will grow at 2.5 to 3 percent . And the last two weeks have been really good for Trump with USMCA and the China deal . And they couldn ’ t have come at a better time for him . ”
As the year draws to a close , here are three big things that could make or break the economy and the stock market as big advantages for Trump heading into his 2020 reelection bid .
Perhaps the biggest risk to Trump — and the toughest knock on his record — is the monthslong decline in manufacturing that began as Trump ’ s trade wars really took hold . Manufacturing tipped into recession territory over the summer and has yet to turn around , leading to weaker economies in states that Trump needs to win in 2020 . That includes places like Pennsylvania , where the unemployment rate is rising and hit 4.2 percent in October .
Michigan also has an unemployment rate above the national average at 4.1 percent and saw declines in the manufacturing sector in both September and October , though some of that came from the now-ended strike at General Motors .
The question for Trump is whether at least stopping new tariffs on Chinese imports — which are often inputs into the manufacturing process — can reverse the slide in manufacturing , a sector that represents a small slice of the overall U.S. economy but was critical to the president ’ s “ Make America Great Again ” message . Economists are skeptical that a China deal leaving most of the existing tariffs in place will have a large impact .
“ I ’ m not sure you are going to see a very sustained change unless uncertainty around trade dissipates completely , ” said Rubeela Farooqi , chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics . “ One positive is the threat of new tariffs at least is not there , though honestly I ’ m not sure it ’ s really gone away . ”
Farooqi noted that some readings on capital spending are looking positive , including in the Empire State and Philadelphia Fed surveys . But it ’ s unclear that a broad uptick in capital spending the White House is hoping for will materialize .
Manufacturing in 2020 could also take a significant hit from Boeing ’ s decision to halt production of its 737 Max airliner after serious safety concerns . Boeing is a giant part of U.S. manufacturing and the hit will be felt not just in the loss of production of planes but also well down the supply chain .
The halt to Boeing 737 Max production next month will likely shave half a percentage point off first-quarter economic growth , RSM economist Joe Brusuelas said in a note to clients . “ The economic damage will likely be noted via the inventory channel , factory orders , industrial production and likely headcount among aircraft suppliers . ”
Trump grew so concerned about the Boeing impact he placed a direct call to the company ’ s now-former CEO , Dennis Muilenburg .
Trump loves to brag about new records in the stock market , tweeting about them relentlessly since taking office in 2017 . And he ’ s correct that there have been big gains , with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up more than 50 percent since his election in November 2016 ( his preferred time frame for calculating the increase ) .
Market professionals say Trump ’ s corporate tax cuts and deregulatory agenda in energy , financial services and other industries get much of the credit for the gains . But the Fed played a role as well .
Stocks took a big plunge in the second half of 2018 as the trade wars raged and the Fed quickly stepped in early this year — after heavy brow-beating from Trump — with a series of rate cuts that helped push markets higher even as overall growth slowed and the impact of Trump ’ s tax cuts faded .
But earlier this month , Fed Chairman Jerome Powell signaled the central bank is out of the rate-cutting business for now , removing one catalyst for future market gains . And a very strong November jobs report only reinforced the Fed ’ s view that the economy should be fine without added stimulus .
This did not sit particularly well with Trump , though he has generally reduced the frequency of his attacks on Powell .
“ Would be sooo great if the Fed would further lower interest rates and quantitative ease , ” Trump tweeted Dec. 17 . “ The Dollar is very strong against other currencies and there is almost no inflation . This is the time to do it . Exports would zoom ! ”
That ’ s not likely to happen . And traders worry that expected slow growth and current high market valuations mean 2020 might not be a boom year for Wall Street .
“ The thing about gains this year was they largely came from an increase in multiples and not earnings growth , ” said Steve Massocca of Wedbush Securities , referring to a phenomena in which the price of a stock goes up without the underlying company actually earning much more money . “ And a lot of it was driven by monetary policy not just from the U.S. , but from the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank . This is an expensive market and the tea leaves don ’ t show significant further gains . ”

One concern bubbling around economic and Wall Street circles these days is that while impeachment doesn ’ t seem like a big deal — everyone thinks Trump will get acquitted in the Senate — the 2020 election could produce a significant drag on markets and economic growth .
Polls suggest a close race no matter who emerges with the Democratic nomination . And even if the nominee is a more business-friendly moderate like former Vice President Joe Biden , a switch in power in the executive branch could bring dramatically different tax and regulatory policies . Some of this will depend on the outcome at the congressional level , because even a President Elizabeth Warren would not be able to reverse Trump ’ s tax cuts with the GOP holding at least one house of Congress . But a radical change in course in the White House is a widely held concern .
“ What is health care going to look like ? Are you going to be able to have corporate profits ? Are we going to have certain taxes on corporate profits ? What are they going to do with corporate buybacks ? What are they going to do with corporate legislation ? It 's a really tough environment , ” Gary Cohn , Trump ’ s former National Economic Council director , said at a recent event hosted by the Securities and Exchange Commission .
Trump ’ s allies are worried about this as well , wondering whether a race that is expected to be more expensive and nastier than perhaps any in American history could create a drag on corporate spending and stock prices that in turn dents the president ’ s consistently solid ratings on the economy .
“ I ’ m a little surprised the market is doing so well now given what I call the ‘ Elizabeth Warren risk , ’ ” Moore said . “ Let ’ s say you get to a 50-50 race , then you start pricing in the likelihood of Warren or really whoever it might be winning , and then the market reacts to that and that drags everything down . ”","Even blah — a 2 percent-or-so growth rate with unemployment still near or below 4 percent — could be enough to help Trump overcome a low approval rating and win again.

But if he really hopes to romp over the eventual Democratic nominee, he’ll probably need markets to keep popping and growth to bubble higher, especially in the industrial Midwest. And it is far from obvious how the United States can get there from here.

“Would be sooo great if the Fed would further lower interest rates and quantitative ease,” Trump tweeted Dec. 17. “The Dollar is very strong against other currencies and there is almost no inflation. This is the time to do it. Exports would zoom!”

That’s not likely to happen. And traders worry that expected slow growth and current high market valuations mean 2020 might not be a boom year for Wall Street.

“The thing about gains this year was they largely came from an increase in multiples and not earnings growth,” said Steve Massocca of Wedbush Securities, referring to a phenomena in which the price of a stock goes up without the underlying company actually earning much more money. “And a lot of it was driven by monetary policy not just from the U.S., but from the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank. This is an expensive market and the tea leaves don’t show significant further gains.”

Will the election itself cause a slowdown?

One concern bubbling around economic and Wall Street circles these days is that while impeachment doesn’t seem like a big deal — everyone thinks Trump will get acquitted in the Senate — the 2020 election could produce a significant drag on markets and economic growth.

Polls suggest a close race no matter who emerges with the Democratic nomination. And even if the nominee is a more business-friendly moderate like former Vice President Joe Biden, a switch in power in the executive branch could bring dramatically different tax and regulatory policies. Some of this will depend on the outcome at the congressional level, because even a President Elizabeth Warren would not be able to reverse Trump’s tax cuts with the GOP holding at least one house of Congress. But a radical change in course in the White House is a widely held concern.

“What is health care going to look like? Are you going to be able to have corporate profits? Are we going to have certain taxes on corporate profits? What are they going to do with corporate buybacks? What are they going to do with corporate legislation? It's a really tough environment,” Gary Cohn, Trump’s former National Economic Council director, said at a recent event hosted by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Trump’s allies are worried about this as well, wondering whether a race that is expected to be more expensive and nastier than perhaps any in American history could create a drag on corporate spending and stock prices that in turn dents the president’s consistently solid ratings on the economy.

“I’m a little surprised the market is doing so well now given what I call the ‘Elizabeth Warren risk,’” Moore said. “Let’s say you get to a 50-50 race, then you start pricing in the likelihood of Warren or really whoever it might be winning, and then the market reacts to that and that drags everything down.”",www.politico.com,left,NvUEGuaZCqEuFHV7

Robert Menendez faces new questions on ties to big donor,2013-03-04,Husna Haq,"More trouble is looming for Sen. Robert Menendez ( D ) of New Jersey : According to an Associated Press investigation , the embattled New Jersey Democrat sponsored legislation that , if passed , would have aided one of his biggest donor 's investment in a natural gas vehicle conversion company .
The report , published Monday , stated that Senator Menendez sponsored a bill to give tax credits and grants to truck and heavy vehicle fleets that converted to natural gas . The bill could have benefited Salomon Melgen , the Florida eye doctor whose close relationship with Menendez has spurred a Senate ethics investigation . Dr. Melgen is an investor and member of the board of directors of Gaseous Fuel Systems Corp. , which designs , manufactures , and sells products to convert diesel- and gas-fuel vehicles to natural gas .
Menendez ’ s backing of the natural-gas bill marks another convergence of interest between the politician and a major donor and is a thorn for the senator . But political watchers in New Jersey say the bill sponsorship is one part of a larger clean-energy agenda from the senator , who has a history of supporting environmental causes . As such , it is unlikely this latest allegation represents a conflict of interest , says Brigid Harrison , a political scientist at Montclair State University , who predicts that Menendez will survive the latest storm .
“ I ’ m still not convinced ... that this kind of behavior reaches to the status where it becomes enormously problematic in voters ’ minds , ” says Professor Harrison . “ I ’ m not seeing any illegality or conflict of interest here . ”
The bill-sponsorship revelation revives the larger issue of the senator ’ s relationship with Melgen , with recent reports suggesting that Menendez was providing political favors for Melgen in exchange for campaign support .
Menendez used Melgen ’ s private jet for two personal trips to the Dominican Republic in 2010 , flights that were not reimbursed until three years later , when news reports called the senator ’ s conduct into question .
Menendez also intervened in a Medicare billing dispute between Melgen and federal authorities , as well as a port security contract , allegedly in order to protect the interests of his friend and donor , according to news reports . The allegations are compounded by a $ 700,000 donation Melgen made to Majority PAC , a `` super political-action committee '' created to elect Senate Democrats that ultimately made a $ 582,500 contribution to Menendez ’ s 2012 reelection campaign , according to the Center for Responsive Politics .
Menendez has vehemently denied all allegations of impropriety , including any allegations of conflict-of-interest stemming from this latest report . His office did not respond to calls regarding his sponsorship of the natural gas bill .
According to the AP report , Menendez joined Senate majority leader Harry Reid ( D ) and Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch ( R ) as a key backer of the natural gas bill . Soon after , Melgen joined the board of directors of Gaseous Fuel Systems Corp. , which makes technology to perform such conversions . Though his investment in the company is confidential under US Securities and Exchange Commission rules , the company required a minimum investment of $ 51,500 , according to the AP .
Ultimately , the bill didn ’ t get enough votes to make it out of the Senate . However , while it was under consideration , a consultant for Gaseous Fuel Systems spent $ 220,000 lobbying Menendez and other congressional officials , according to interviews and Senate records as reported by the AP .
“ There is no evidence that Menendez offered direct help or intervened on behalf of the company or Melgen , ” the AP said in its report . “ Instead , the connection between the two men ’ s interests in natural gas is the latest example of the close symmetry between the senator … and his millionaire backer . ”
Evidence of “ close symmetry ” in this latest development , say analysts , is not enough to topple Menendez .
“ Menendez has been involved in clean-energy technology for a long time , ” says Ross Baker , a political scientist at Rutgers University in New Brunswick , N.J. “ In light of Melgen 's apparently limited and distant role in GFS , I think it is more of a coincidence than anything more sinister . I think it is as likely that Menendez got Melgen interested in converting truck fleets to natural gas as it was the other way around . ”
Other clean-energy initiatives the senator has supported include co-sponsoring legislation aimed at jump-starting offshore wind energy , extending solar energy tax credits , and creating block grants to spur green-energy projects .
Menendez recently reintroduced the Repeal Big Oil Tax Subsidies Act and Close Big Oil Tax Loopholes Act , legislation he originally introduced in the 112th Congress to end tax subsidies for the “ Big 5 ” oil companies .
“ It isn ’ t that this came out of the blue , it ’ s part of a larger cohesive agenda ... to deal with energy issues the country is facing , ” says Harrison of Montclair State University . “ His record is an accurate reflection of his policy concerns , and this is one part of that . ”
And though the AP report singled out Menendez , the senator isn ’ t alone in supporting the natural gas bill – or in sharing a passion with supporters for similar causes . In fact , the House version of the natural gas legislation had 181 co-sponsors .
The natural gas industry spends hundreds of thousands of dollars lobbying members of Congress , including Menendez and his staff . “ They are not alone in being lobbied , ” says Harrison .
Menendez ’ s ethics controversy has had an impact on his poll numbers , and this latest development may further damage the senator ’ s image .
A Quinnipiac University poll found Menendez ’ s approval ratings plummeted 15 percentage points between January and February , as news reports emerged about his relationship with Melgen . His approval rating dropped form 51 percent in mid-January to 36 percent in mid-February . The same poll found only 28 percent of New Jersey voters said the senator was “ honest and trustworthy . ”

You have to get creative and work from the ground up . ”
Messrs. Trump and Sanders stand apart from other 2020 candidates when it comes to high-frequency donors because they cultivated loyal fan bases during the 2016 presidential race . And the campaigns have perfected how to engage them , through emails , text messages and phone applications that ask for money , according to interviews with some of the most frequent givers .
The number of super donors , particularly for Mr. Trump , is likely higher than the Journal ’ s count because there is less public data available on the president ’ s donors than the Democratic candidates . That is because presidential campaigns only itemize donations when a donor hits the FEC ’ s $ 201 threshold requiring it . But ActBlue , the payment processor used by nearly all Democratic candidates , discloses information about all of its donors , including those who gave during the first half of the year . Mr. Trump began using a new Republican payment processor , which hasn ’ t yet filed a comprehensive public report .
Mr. Sanders ’ s campaign aides say his donors average three contributions apiece and that they have found repeat donors are more likely to become volunteers . “ We ’ re proud to have people who give what they can , when they can , ” said Tim Tagaris , a senior adviser to the Sanders campaign and chief architect of Mr. Sanders ’ s 2016 digital fundraising program . “ It ’ s indicative of a campaign that has steady funding that can sustain for the long haul . ”
While the campaigns are happy to have the cash flow in , the super donor phenomenon has at times created an accounting headache when it comes time to file their FEC reports . The campaigns of Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders have had to return money to supporters who went over campaign-contribution limits by donating many times in small increments . In total , Mr. Sanders refunded about $ 487,000 in contributions through the end of September , the FEC shows .
“ I gave so much that the campaign recently cut me a check because I ’ d gone over the limit , ” said Trump donor Michael Burnham , 51 , who lives just outside Portland , Maine , and said the Trump campaign ’ s app is “ addictive. ” He has made at least 200 contributions to the re-election campaign , starting in January 2017 , FEC records show .
Other donors say they have studied up on the best donation strategies .

They also volunteer for Mr. Sanders and promote him on social media and to their friends .
“ He has a very well-established history of fighting for [ progressive ] policies because they are morally and ethically right , ” Mr. Peloza said .
He said he decided to give in larger chunks near the start of the campaign . Mrs. Peloza , meanwhile , said she thought it was important to show enthusiasm by showering the campaign with many small gifts . Part of why she did so , she said , was “ to balance out my husband ’ s much larger donations and provide a larger number of smaller donations to the campaign , ” she said .

The Supreme Court on Tuesday insisted that many donations to predominantly conservative political nonprofit groups — what 's often called dark money — be disclosed , seven weeks ahead of the 2018 midterm elections .
The ruling closes , at least for now , a loophole that has allowed wealthy donors to finance aggressive ads while staying anonymous . Crafted by the Federal Election Commission nearly 40 years ago , the loophole flourished after the 2010 Citizens United ruling .
The court set aside an order issued by Chief Justice John Roberts on Saturday . The social welfare group Crossroads GPS , a defendant in the lawsuit , had fought to stall disclosure while it prepares to appeal . It failed in the D.C . Circuit Court of Appeals and then appealed to the Supreme Court .
The disclosure requirement is expected to apply to explicitly political ads by nonprofit groups for the remaining weeks of the campaign season .
The decisions came in a 2016 lawsuit against Crossroads and the FEC , by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington . Chief Judge Beryl Howell of the federal district court in Washington , D.C. , last month ruled in CREW 's favor . She gave the FEC 45 days to replace the regulation , which it did n't do .
CREW 's executive director , Noah Bookbinder , said the Supreme Court ruling `` is going to affect spending in the 2018 elections . Groups that run these kinds of ads — ads that tell you to vote for or against another candidate — are going to have to disclose their contributors , and that is incredibly important . ''
The Supreme Court 's decision comes less than a week after a new research report by the government reform group Issue One , which puts some dollar amounts on what these unreported donors are giving . The report , which took a year of research , finds that the top 15 politically active nonprofits raised and spent more than $ 600 million on campaigns between 2010 , when Citizens United boosted secret fundraising , and 2016 .
The secret giving is made possible by a regulatory loophole at the FEC . The groups , usually organized as 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) social welfare organizations or 501 ( c ) ( 6 ) business associations , do n't register as political committees with the commission . With the loophole , the FEC wants donor disclosure only when a donor earmarks the money for specific ads .
The top four spenders identified by Issue One are the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , the mainstream conservative Crossroads GPS , the Koch network 's Americans for Prosperity and the National Rifle Association . Issue One says that collectively , the four groups pumped at least $ 357 million into elections between 2010 and 2016 .
`` Opaque organizations are using contributions from opaque donors and secretly funding election campaigns and ads that are urging viewers to vote for or against candidates , '' said Michael Beckel , research manager at Issue One . `` And it remains very difficult to track back the true sources of dark money groups . ''
Meanwhile , Americans for Prosperity has launched AFP Action — a superPAC that will regularly report its donors to the FEC , sidestepping the disclosure controversy .","Supreme Court Orders Disclosure For Dark Money, As New Report Unveils Some Donors

The ruling closes, at least for now, a loophole that has allowed wealthy donors to finance aggressive ads while staying anonymous. Crafted by the Federal Election Commission nearly 40 years ago, the loophole flourished after the 2010 Citizens United ruling.

The court set aside an order issued by Chief Justice John Roberts on Saturday. The social welfare group Crossroads GPS, a defendant in the lawsuit, had fought to stall disclosure while it prepares to appeal. It failed in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and then appealed to the Supreme Court.

The disclosure requirement is expected to apply to explicitly political ads by nonprofit groups for the remaining weeks of the campaign season.

The decisions came in a 2016 lawsuit against Crossroads and the FEC, by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Chief Judge Beryl Howell of the federal district court in Washington, D.C., last month ruled in CREW's favor. She gave the FEC 45 days to replace the regulation, which it didn't do.

CREW's executive director, Noah Bookbinder, said the Supreme Court ruling ""is going to affect spending in the 2018 elections. Groups that run these kinds of ads — ads that tell you to vote for or against another candidate — are going to have to disclose their contributors, and that is incredibly important.""

The Supreme Court's decision comes less than a week after a new research report by the government reform group Issue One, which puts some dollar amounts on what these unreported donors are giving. The report, which took a year of research, finds that the top 15 politically active nonprofits raised and spent more than $600 million on campaigns between 2010, when Citizens United boosted secret fundraising, and 2016.

The secret giving is made possible by a regulatory loophole at the FEC. The groups, usually organized as 501(c)(4) social welfare organizations or 501(c)(6) business associations, don't register as political committees with the commission. With the loophole, the FEC wants donor disclosure only when a donor earmarks the money for specific ads.

The top four spenders identified by Issue One are the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the mainstream conservative Crossroads GPS, the Koch network's Americans for Prosperity and the National Rifle Association. Issue One says that collectively, the four groups pumped at least $357 million into elections between 2010 and 2016.

""Opaque organizations are using contributions from opaque donors and secretly funding election campaigns and ads that are urging viewers to vote for or against candidates,"" said Michael Beckel, research manager at Issue One. ""And it remains very difficult to track back the true sources of dark money groups.""

Meanwhile, Americans for Prosperity has launched AFP Action — a superPAC that will regularly report its donors to the FEC, sidestepping the disclosure controversy.",www.npr.org,center,yCh4S4De5m7M3Kp4

WASHINGTON – Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump each raced to their strongest fundraising month of the campaign in July, but Clinton and her allies continue to outmuscle her GOP rival in the air and ground war for the presidency, according to new details of the candidates’ spending.

Clinton pulled in more than $52 million directly into her campaign last month and spent more than $38 million, according to her campaign’s filings Saturday with federal election regulators.

Trump raised nearly $36.7 million for his campaign and spent at a far slower pace than Clinton, reporting nearly $18.5 million in expenses in July as Clinton and her allies savaged him on the airwaves.

Trump, who has shunned much of the traditions of presidential campaigns, grew his staff modestly last month, employing 82 people, a USA TODAY review shows. Clinton, by contrast, employed 703 aides in July as she readied for her confrontation with Trump in key battlegrounds such as Ohio and Florida.

New campaign reports filed Saturday with the Federal Election Commission show Clinton with another advantage: Super-wealthy Democrats are giving early and often to boost the former secretary of State’s presidential bid and to aid Democrats hoping to seize seats in Congress. Billionaires, such as California environmentalist Tom Steyer and financier George Soros, plowed millions into Democratic-aligned super PACs last month.

Steyer alone pumped $7 million of his hedge-fund fortune into his super PAC, NextGen Climate Action, which plans an aggressive campaign to turn out voters to help Clinton and others in the party.

Two deep-pocketed Democrats, Slim-Fast founder Daniel Abraham and financier Donald Sussman, contributed $3 million each last month to Priorities USA Action, a super PAC aiding Clinton. In all, Sussman has doled out $11 million to Priorities so far in this election. A super PAC can raise unlimited amounts.

Trump, a real-estate magnate who self-funded his bid for the GOP nomination, has relied less on the super-wealthy for financial support, drawing a large share of his donations from the supporters who flock to his rallies, follow him on Twitter and answer his email solicitations.

His filings show that Trump pulled in $12.7 million last month from people who donated in amounts of $200 or less. That accounts for nearly 65% of his individual contributions.

Those small donations made up about 36% of her contributions from individuals last month, up from nearly 25% a month earlier, the filings show.

Trump’s reliance on small donors comes as few of the GOP’s wealthiest givers have invested in his presidential ambitions.

Two of the super PACs aiding his bid – Great America PAC and Make America Number 1 – together raised nearly $4.5 million in July. A single contributor, New York hedge-fund manager Robert Mercer, accounted for $2 million of that total.

Another super PAC that has begun to spend heavily to promote Trump’s candidacy, Rebuilding America Now, and has ties to a longtime Trump friend, California businessman Tom Barrack, won’t file a report on its fundraising until later this year.

In all, Clinton’s campaign team boasts that it collected $90 million last month for Hillary for America and its two joint fundraising operations with the Democratic National Committee.

Her campaign alone started August with nearly $58.5 million in available cash.

Trump’s aides have said the campaign collected $80 million directly and through joint-fundraising arrangements with the Republican National Committee, after lagging behind Clinton during the first two months of the general-election campaign.

His reports, released late Saturday night, show his campaign starting August with $38.4 million in available cash, far less money than Clinton had stockpiled. However, Trump can boost that number easily by dipping into his personal fortune.

Trump added another $2 million of his own money to the campaign last month, bringing his total contributions to nearly $45 million, FEC records show.

His campaign continued to pay money to Trump's companies for expenses, such as rent and travel. More than $782,000 went to various Trump enterprises, including his airline, Tag Air.

Trump’s single largest expense in July: $8.4 million paid to San Antonio company Giles-Parscale for digital consulting and online advertising. Payments to the firm accounted for more than 45% of Trump’s expenses last month. The firm has longstanding ties to the Trump Organization. Its website lists several other Trump-related enterprises in its client portfolio, including Trump Winery, Trump International Realty, the Eric Trump Foundation and Melania Trump’s cosmetics and fashion-jewelry business.

The firm's president Brad Parscale became the Trump campaign's digital director in June.

The filing also shows Trump making a $20,000 payment to Green Monster Consulting, the firm run by his former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, weeks after Lewandowski left the campaign.

With Team Trump improving its financial picture in July, Clinton and her running mate, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, are intensifying their fundraising pace, barnstorming the country in the weeks ahead to collect cash from wealthy Democrats and celebrities.

On Tuesday, for instance, Hollywood power couple, singer Justin Timberlake and actress Jessica Biel, are slated to host a Clinton fundraising lunch.

Trump, who has shunned creating a traditional campaign structure, is relying heavily on the Republican National Committee to help organize his high-dollar fundraising events and to build a field operation to identify and turn out voters.

The RNC has deployed hundreds of workers to battleground states. Saturday’s campaign filings show the RNC with 251 people on its payroll in July. National party officials say they now have 504 staffers in the field, with the highest numbers working in Pennsylvania and Florida, where Trump needs to gain ground on Clinton.

On Friday, Trump launched his first commercials of the general-election campaign, spending $4.8 million to run ads into those two states, along with Ohio and North Carolina.

Clinton and her allies, however, have dominated the airwaves since June, pumping more than $100 million into TV ads that promote Clinton and blister Trump as unfit to serve in the White House and out of touch with working Americans.

Trump gave a hint Sunday that he may be changing his tone , saying , `` Certainly I would take contributions , I actually like the idea of investing in a campaign . ''
But on Tuesday evening -- just days after appearing at the New Jersey fundraiser -- Trump railed against the lack of transparency in the system and lamented how difficult it is to identify donors who make big contributions to organizations supporting presidential candidates .
`` I think the most important thing is transparency , '' Trump told reporters . `` You need to know who 's putting up what so when they start making deals in a year or two years or three years , you know what 's happening . ''

And yet , some guests said they attended Trump 's weekend fundraiser and donated -- begrudgingly -- because they did not want to jeopardize their business relationships with the Kushners or the Trumps , according to an attendee . Both families are powerful forces in the real estate industry and the Kushners have already thrown their support behind Trump 's campaign . Seryl Kushner donated $ 100,000 to the super PAC supporting him , according to a source close to the family .

And yet, some guests said they attended Trump's weekend fundraiser and donated -- begrudgingly -- because they did not want to jeopardize their business relationships with the Kushners or the Trumps, according to an attendee. Both families are powerful forces in the real estate industry and the Kushners have already thrown their support behind Trump's campaign. Seryl Kushner donated $100,000 to the super PAC supporting him, according to a source close to the family.

On Friday, Trump will head to Massachusetts for an event that the host is branding as a fundraiser but the campaign is insisting is not.

Ernie Boch Jr., the chief executive of Boch Automotive Enterprises and the host of Friday's event, said he had received at least 700 RSVPs from friends and acquaintances. He said the campaign plans to charge $100 per person.

""I've always been a Trump fan since the '80s,"" Boch said. ""He's a hero to most business guys.""

Meanwhile, Trump and his campaign said they had no plans to collect donations from the event.

""It's just a very small situation, and I don't consider it a fundraiser,"" Trump said. ""In fact, people don't have to pay.""

Trump's campaign spokeswoman said they would only use the donations to cover the cost of the event, such as food and beverages. Boston chef Tony Ambrose is expected to cater the event, while Massachusetts cover band Fortune will supply the entertainment.

Boch initially reached out to the campaign in the hopes of planning a more intimate affair with a higher price tag. However, Trump's campaign lobbied for a larger gathering, he said.

Boch said the event is ""a chance for me to get up close"" to the candidate, but added that he's not expecting any favors in return.

As for whether he has any reservations about helping a billionaire candidate raise funds, Boch said, ""You can never have enough money.""",www.cnn.com,left,pJaDidHEHY6SidMW

Climate billionaire aims for 2016
California billionaire Tom Steyer turned heads in Washington with the news that he plans to spend $ 100 million to help make climate change a defining issue in this year ’ s elections .
But it gets even bigger : The hedge fund executive turned green activist might be willing to lay out even more than that eye-popping number , and he ’ s looking to spend it in places that are also important for 2016 .
Steyer ’ s strategy calls for targeting races including Senate or gubernatorial contests in Iowa , New Hampshire , Florida and possibly Pennsylvania — all key battlegrounds in presidential politics , sources familiar with the plan told ███ on Tuesday .
The fleshed-out details paint a picture of a big-pocketed donor who is going beyond his early efforts to help individual Democrats , such as Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey and Virginia Gov . Terry McAuliffe , as well as address specific issues like the Keystone XL pipeline — and instead wants to give his signature climate cause a starring role in the next presidential race .
Steyer ’ s operation “ is going to be very aggressive ” and will set itself apart from the efforts of mainstream environmental groups , said Betsy Taylor , a Takoma Park , Md.-based leader of a network of wealthy climate donors who attended a recent discussion of the strategy at the billionaire ’ s California ranch . “ They ’ re fearless . They don ’ t worry about access to Democratic Party leadership . ”
Steyer isn ’ t publicly saying much about how he ’ ll spend of his projected campaign war chest through his NextGen Climate Action super PAC , which The New York Times first reported Monday . The strategy could make him a progressive counterweight to big conservative donors like Charles and David Koch . But it ’ s unclear how far even $ 100 million will go in the post- Citizens United world , or whether global warming can compete on the presidential campaign trail with issues like jobs and President Barack Obama ’ s health care law .
Still , Steyer has told potential backers he has big plans . Those include trying to influence the debate about climate change in Senate races in Iowa and New Hampshire and the gubernatorial contest in Florida .
He may also spend money influencing the governor ’ s race in Pennsylvania , where one of the Democrats vying to unseat Republican incumbent Tom Corbett is former Bill Clinton environmental aide Katie McGinty .
In addition to looking ahead to 2016 , Steyer ’ s strategy includes focusing on states where a candidate who supports acting on climate change faces an opponent who ’ s a “ denier . ”
That description matches the governor ’ s race in Florida , where Republican Gov . Rick Scott ’ s top challenger is Democratic former Gov . Charlie Crist , and the Senate race in Iowa , where Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley and several potential Republican challengers are vying to replace retiring Democrat Tom Harkin .
While Scott has said he doesn ’ t believe that science has proven that humans are causing climate change , Crist used to hold annual conferences on global warming when he was governor and was a loud critic of BP during the 2010 Gulf of Mexico spill . And Crist may need all the financial help he can get : Scott , a former hospital chain executive , is planning to spend as much as $ 100 million for his reelection effort , possibly enough to match Steyer ’ s entire nationwide campaign .
Besides being a notoriously tight swing state , Florida is a prime example for climate advocates of how sea-level rise can threaten communities .
Steyer also wants to target states that are significant in determining whether Democrats can keep the Senate this year . Those include Iowa and New Hampshire .
And he wants to sway governor ’ s races in states where the winner could move ahead with action on climate change without waiting for Washington . That could point toward jumping into Pennsylvania to help McGinty , who chaired the White House Council on Environmental Quality under Clinton , or other Democratic gubernatorial candidates .
Steyer and his PAC ’ s chief strategist , veteran Democratic operative Chris Lehane , outlined the approach during a gathering of wealthy climate donors at the ranch during the first weekend of February . Columbia University climate researcher James Hansen , former head of NASA ’ s Goddard Institute for Space Studies , was on hand to give a briefing on potential climate change effects in the years and decades ahead . The gathering also included fellow billionaires and some of Steyer ’ s oldest friends from the financial community .
The New York Times first reported Monday that Steyer ’ s goal is to spend about $ 50 million of his own money and raise another $ 50 million from green-minded donors to use in 2014 . NextGen officials confirmed those figures Tuesday but stressed that $ 100 million is not the ceiling for what Steyer ’ s PAC may spend this year .","Tom Steyer's strategy could make him a progressive counterweight to big GOP donors.

In addition to looking ahead to 2016, Steyer’s strategy includes focusing on states where a candidate who supports acting on climate change faces an opponent who’s a “denier.”

That description matches the governor’s race in Florida, where Republican Gov. Rick Scott’s top challenger is Democratic former Gov. Charlie Crist, and the Senate race in Iowa, where Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley and several potential Republican challengers are vying to replace retiring Democrat Tom Harkin.

( PHOTOS: 2016: Who’s next?)

While Scott has said he doesn’t believe that science has proven that humans are causing climate change, Crist used to hold annual conferences on global warming when he was governor and was a loud critic of BP during the 2010 Gulf of Mexico spill. And Crist may need all the financial help he can get: Scott, a former hospital chain executive, is planning to spend as much as $100 million for his reelection effort, possibly enough to match Steyer’s entire nationwide campaign.

Besides being a notoriously tight swing state, Florida is a prime example for climate advocates of how sea-level rise can threaten communities.

Steyer also wants to target states that are significant in determining whether Democrats can keep the Senate this year. Those include Iowa and New Hampshire.

And he wants to sway governor’s races in states where the winner could move ahead with action on climate change without waiting for Washington. That could point toward jumping into Pennsylvania to help McGinty, who chaired the White House Council on Environmental Quality under Clinton, or other Democratic gubernatorial candidates.

Steyer and his PAC’s chief strategist, veteran Democratic operative Chris Lehane, outlined the approach during a gathering of wealthy climate donors at the ranch during the first weekend of February. Columbia University climate researcher James Hansen, former head of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, was on hand to give a briefing on potential climate change effects in the years and decades ahead. The gathering also included fellow billionaires and some of Steyer’s oldest friends from the financial community.

“There were definitely some heavy hitters there,” Taylor said.

The New York Times first reported Monday that Steyer’s goal is to spend about $50 million of his own money and raise another $50 million from green-minded donors to use in 2014. NextGen officials confirmed those figures Tuesday but stressed that $100 million is not the ceiling for what Steyer’s PAC may spend this year.",www.politico.com,left,w2hun5oRC3OSclMa

It turns out Mynett 's firm was funneled a boat load of Omar 's campaign cash . He was paid more than $ 200,000 for consulting and the campaign reimbursed at least $ 21,000 for his personal travel . That travel was n't properly reported or itemized .
An official complaint regarding the large payments to Mynett 's firm has already been filed , alleging she broke the law .
`` Today , NLPC filed a Complaint with the Federal Election Commission ( FEC ) against Rep. Ilhan Omar ( D-MN ) alleging that she and her campaign violated the prohibition on the personal use of campaign funds by reimbursing political consultant Tim Mynett for his travel in 2019 . The Complaint also alleges that Omar and her campaign failed to itemize the travel reimbursements , as required , '' the National Legal and Policy Center released in a statement Wednesday .
`` Although Mynett 's formal relationship with Rep. Omar 's campaign began in July 2018 , with the payment of $ 7000 directly to Mynett , the reimbursements for Mynett 's travel did not commence until April 2019 , the same month that Dr. Mynett alleges in her filing that her husband told her of the affair , and made a 'shocking declaration of love ' for Rep. Omar , '' the complaint states .
According to the divorce filing , Mynett 's `` more recent travel and long work hours now appear to be more related to his affair with Rep. Omar than his actual work commitments . ''
And then there are these timing details from the Washington Examiner :
Here 's the odd thing : The overwhelming majority of Omar 's funds spent on the E Street Group were paid after she won the contested primary and during the totally noncompetitive general election race in her D+26 district . Contrary to FEC rules , Omar 's filings did not designate whether her E Street Group disbursements ( or any of her disbursements ) were for the primary election or the general election .
Omar is refusing to discuss her `` personal life '' and has not commented on the issue of campaign funds being improperly used .
`` I have no interest in allowing the conversation about my personal life to continue and so I have no desire to discuss it , '' Omar told CBS Minnesota today .
In June , Omar was ordered to payback thousands of dollars to her campaign after breaking campaign finance laws .","Yesterday the New York Post reported that Congresswoman Ilhan Omar is having an affair with Democratic strategist Tim Mynett.

It turns out Mynett's firm was funneled a boat load of Omar's campaign cash. He was paid more than $200,000 for consulting and the campaign reimbursed at least $21,000 for his personal travel. That travel wasn't properly reported or itemized.

An official complaint regarding the large payments to Mynett's firm has already been filed, alleging she broke the law.

""Today, NLPC filed a Complaint with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) against Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) alleging that she and her campaign violated the prohibition on the personal use of campaign funds by reimbursing political consultant Tim Mynett for his travel in 2019. The Complaint also alleges that Omar and her campaign failed to itemize the travel reimbursements, as required,"" the National Legal and Policy Center released in a statement Wednesday.

""Although Mynett's formal relationship with Rep. Omar's campaign began in July 2018, with the payment of $7000 directly to Mynett, the reimbursements for Mynett's travel did not commence until April 2019, the same month that Dr. Mynett alleges in her filing that her husband told her of the affair, and made a 'shocking declaration of love' for Rep. Omar,"" the complaint states.

According to the divorce filing, Mynett's ""more recent travel and long work hours now appear to be more related to his affair with Rep. Omar than his actual work commitments.""

And then there are these timing details from the Washington Examiner:

Here's the odd thing: The overwhelming majority of Omar's funds spent on the E Street Group were paid after she won the contested primary and during the totally noncompetitive general election race in her D+26 district. Contrary to FEC rules, Omar's filings did not designate whether her E Street Group disbursements (or any of her disbursements) were for the primary election or the general election.





Omar is refusing to discuss her ""personal life"" and has not commented on the issue of campaign funds being improperly used.

""I have no interest in allowing the conversation about my personal life to continue and so I have no desire to discuss it,"" Omar told CBS Minnesota today.





In June, Omar was ordered to payback thousands of dollars to her campaign after breaking campaign finance laws.",www.townhall.com,right,GNKWfCf3N2JLKvPo

Nearly two years later , the U.S. Green Party ’ s last candidate for president is still spending that money .
Ongoing litigation , travel costs , and staff salaries are also likely to eat up whatever is left , meaning those who donated to Stein are unlikely to receive a once-promised chance to vote on how the post-recount money would be spent . Nor have donors been given much of a window into how Stein is actually spending their donations .
The last FEC filing from the Stein campaign was for the month of September 2017 . And the last update from the campaign itself came in a post on April 20 , in which it said it was down to $ 932,178 in recount funds .
“ It is strange that they would just stop filing reports given they were a legitimate , professional campaign , and despite still having more than a million dollars in cash on hand , ” Andrew Mayersohn , a researcher at the Center for Responsive Politics , told The ███ .
Jonathan S. Abady , an attorney with Emery Celli Brinckerhoff & Abady LLP , the New York-based firm that represents Stein and her campaign , told The ███ that legal efforts on the recount persist to this day .
But the opacity surrounding the expenditure of money—combined with the fact that a good chunk of the spending has come after all efforts to recount the vote were terminated—has fed criticism that Stein was more interested in boosting her political operations than in recounting votes . It ’ s also drawn the ire of regulators . In a May 7 , 2018 letter , the FEC warned Stein campaign treasurer Steven Welzer that he was violating federal law by not accounting for half a year of spending .
“ The failure to timely file this report may result in civil money penalties , suspension of matching funds , an audit or legal enforcement action , ” the letter states , noting there is no grace period .
From the moment Stein started raising money for a recount , there were reasons to be skeptical . The Green Party ’ s nominee for president was “ launching an effort to ensure the integrity of our elections , ” asking for $ 2.5 million , getting it , doubling the goal and then doubling it again . All of this was done after Stein publicly dismissed reports that Russian state actors had sought to undermine the integrity of the vote and after seeming increasingly unconcerned with who actually won in November .
Cynics smirked , believing Stein was just cashing in on the shock of Hillary Clinton ’ s defeat and trying to stifle the criticism that she had been a “ spoiler. ” She was the first in a legion of # Resistance grifters , in this telling—a charge amplified by President-elect Donald Trump .
In reality , it wasn ’ t even Stein ’ s idea to contest the results . Well-respected computer scientists , in need of legal standing and a proxy , urged her to do it after the Clinton campaign declined . That she raked in more than $ 7.3 million raised eyebrows , but that money was freely given by people who wanted her to pursue the costly process of double checking the ballots . In exchange , the Stein campaign promised to let the approximately 161,000 donors exercise their right to vote on how to disperse any money left over .
“ Once those costs are finalized , all remaining money will go to a set of non-partisan election reform and voting rights organizations based on your input in an online , ranked choice vote , ” Stein wrote in a letter to donors ; though , at other times , she and her campaign said it was unlikely there would be any money left over .
`` We are raising money into a dedicated account for a recount campaign . The money can not be used for anything else . It can not be used for my campaign . It can not be used for the Green Party . It can only be used for the recount , '' she added during an interview on ABC .
Stein campaign spokesperson Dave Schwab said , after this story was published , that there still could be a plebiscite . `` [ W ] e will poll donors on what to do with surplus funds once recount-related litigation is over and we are able to establish a surplus , '' Schwab told The ███ . But he did not provide more detail on how money is being used , outside of the litigation .
Running a recount is actually quite expensive . Filing fees to request the recounts in Wisconsin and Michigan alone cost over $ 2.3 million . Attorney fees have taken some $ 2.6 million from the pot . Abady , one of the recount lawyers , told The ███ that the Stein campaign is still seeking access “ to the software used in Wisconsin ’ s voting systems. ” On March 15 , the Wisconsin Elections Committee granted that request , Abady said , a decision immediately challenged by two voting system vendors who don ’ t want anyone prying in to their proprietary source code .
Stein has also “ brought a separate challenge concerning the scope of the software inspection permitted to her , ” Abady added . “ Both challenges are before the same judge in Wisconsin state court and he will likely set a briefing schedule in the next few weeks . ”
In Pennsylvania , Abady said , the legal effort concerns a “ broken election system ” that “ forces voters to use unreliable machines and denies them the ability to make sure their votes were counted. ” The Stein team , he added , “ filed an amended complaint in February 2017 that focuses on reforming the system for future elections ”
Preparing for future elections , however , is distinctly different than relitigating the past one , raising questions as to whether it falls under the purview of a formal recount effort . Other expenditures have raised similar questions . According to Stein ’ s April 20 update , more than $ 363,900 has been spent on “ Media ” even though , in 2016 , donors were told that media expenses “ could go up to $ 300K. ” Other costs are more in line with predictions . By 2018 , the campaign had spent $ 820,000 on “ Travel and Events , “ Staff support , ” and “ Recount observer costs. ” Another $ 150,000 was set aside for a “ Compliance reserve ” — a total slightly under estimates that CBS reported in December 13 , 2016 .
Much of the spending has taken place long since any hope for more recounts came to an end . Of the more than $ 509,000 spent on staff , more than $ 300,000 has been spent since February 20 , 2017 , according to the Stein campaign . The same is true for 87 percent of travel and events spending .
As the Center for Responsive Politics has noted , U.S. law dictates that funds raised for a recount “ only go toward expenses directly related to the recount , such as paying state staff that counts the votes or any other administrative or overhead payments , as well as post-election litigation . ”
Staff who appear to be working on the recount are the some of same who worked on Stein ’ s presidential campaign . Schwab , director of communications , made $ 3,840 in September 2017 , according to the last available FEC filing . Campaign Manager David Cobb was also on the payroll as of September 2017 , taking home a monthly salary of $ 7,520 . Cobb announced the recount effort in a Facebook Live video and , in a subsequent video , identified himself as “ Jill Stein ’ s campaign manager for the recount. ” Cobb told The ███ he is “ still with the campaign , ” but did not elaborate .
In September 2017 , Carl Romanelli , a former Green Party candidate for Senate in Pennsylvania , was also paid $ 2,000 that month , plus $ 272.50 in travel , for “ Recount Organizing Services , ” according to the FEC filing . During the campaign , Romanelli worked as a “ State Organizer ” and “ Field Organizer , ” per reports filed with the FEC .
As for the ongoing litigation that the Stein recount effort is supporting , not everyone is convinced it is meritorious .
“ I am not going to spend an ounce of thought on a legal challenge to an election two years ago when we have critical midterm elections in a few months , ” said Neil Makhija , a lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania Law School , when asked for comment . Makhija , who ran for public office in 2016 as a Democrat , argued that Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf , also a Democrat , “ is doing everything he can to update our systems to be secure and accurate . ”
But David Jefferson , a computer scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , says there is good reason to keep fighting . An expert on election security , he provided technical support and guidance during the initial recount effort .
“ It absolutely was not a Stein campaign cash grab , ” he told The ███ . And while examining voting machines and their source code may not change the result of the last election — Stein ’ s attorneys would quickly note they are not trying to — it could help secure the next one , Jefferson argued . It is about transparency .
“ To be perfectly clear , we never really had any evidence [ of vote hacking ] , ” he said . “ The point we have always been making is that you have to look . You have to check .

Democratic presidential candidates on Monday provided the first broad look at campaign finances. Early fund-raising is no guarantee of votes in 2020, but it is a barometer of which Democrats are generating interest — not an easy feat in a crowded field.

[Here are the nine biggest takeaways from the 2020 money race so far.]

We crunched the fund-raising numbers for 16 Democrats, and the revelations below are telling about how much money they can invest in staff and events in critical early-voting states. Democrats toward the rear of the pack are at a big disadvantage: Their ability to build campaigns to go the distance will be limited unless they improve their fund-raising.

Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris have raised the most money from individual donors.

Senator Bernie Sanders entered the race with a huge network of online donors from his 2016 presidential bid. Senator Kamala Harris also showed her fund-raising strength, as did former Representative Beto O’Rourke, who raised a mountain of cash in his unsuccessful Senate bid last year.

Total Raised From Individual Contributions (in millions) + Show all candidates

Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand transferred huge sums from their Senate campaigns.

Several candidates supplemented their presidential fund-raising by transferring money raised in past federal races. Legally, money can be transferred only from federal campaigns, giving members of Congress an advantage over candidates who are mayors or governors, or those who have never held federal office. Candidates can also contribute their own money.

Transfers and Candidate Contributions (in millions) Note: Mr. Sanders ended the quarter with roughly $11 million still available to be transferred, his campaign said. Representative Tulsi Gabbard’s transfer amount excludes a redundant transaction made for compliance reasons. Candidate contributions exclude amounts under $10,000.

Sanders also has the most cash in the bank.

The first nominating contests are not until February 2020, so campaigns need to be able to pay their bills for many months to stay afloat. Cash on hand includes loans from candidates and transfers from their previous committees.

Mr. Sanders is counting on small donations to fuel his presidential bid, as is Ms. Warren, who has sworn off holding high-dollar fund-raisers. Ms. Harris has a strong base of online donors, but she has also raised significant sums from traditional donors. Some candidates, such as Ms. Gillibrand, Senator Cory Booker and former Gov.

President Trump’s re-election campaign also reported its fund-raising. The campaign brought in about $30 million in the first three months of 2019 — roughly equal to that of Mr. Sanders and Ms. Harris put together.

Mr. Trump has his own powerful base of small donors. The campaign said its average donation was $34.26.

Online donations of modest amounts will also play an enormous role in the Democratic primary race: many candidates are relying heavily on grass-roots donors to finance their campaigns. Money from small donors is a point of pride, showing that candidates are attracting support from regular people around the country.

WASHINGTON – A record-breaking total of more than $5 billion was spent on the just concluded midterm elections, but dozens of candidates who spent more money than their opponents were not celebrating a win on election night.

In at least 41 House races, the bigger spender lost – including 36 contests in which the Democrat outspent the Republican, according to an analysis of campaign spending totals compiled by USA TODAY.

That’s not to say the amount of money raised and spent was not a factor. The winner of the majority of House races was the candidate who raised and spent the most money. Democratic candidates held a huge spending advantage over Republicans in this year’s midterms, which drew massive voter turnout compared to most off-year elections.

Democrats ousted one incumbent GOP senator – Nevada’s Dean Heller – and at least 22 Republican incumbent House members (with several races still to be decided), while Republicans defeated four Senate Democratic incumbents – Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, and Bill Nelson of Florida.

Another big factor in winning at the polls remains a longstanding trend in American politics: the power of incumbency. More than 90 percent of the incumbents who did run for re-election won their races.

Records were also set by the more than $1.3 billion spent by outside groups – those other than the candidates’ campaign committees – and the $98 million in so-called dark money. These are funds spent by groups who don’t have to reveal their donors.

CHARLESTON, S.C. — Jeb Bush says he's not reducing his presidential campaign, he is simply refocusing it with an eye toward the early caucus and primary states.

""We've made an adjustment in our campaign,"" Bush said Saturday before conducting a town hall in the pivotal state of South Carolina. ""That's what leaders do.""

Stumping the Palmetto State a day after his campaign announced staff reductions and pay cuts, Bush dismissed critics who said the changes reflect a struggling campaign that is losing ground to any number of rivals.

""Blah, blah, blah,"" Bush said. ""That's my answer — blah, blah, blah.""

The cuts came after a slide in polls that now show the former Florida governor well behind Donald Trump, Ben Carson and other Republican candidates, creating some unrest among Bush donors.

In response, Bush cited a number of candidates who have held early leads in Republican contests and then faded, a list that ranges from Herman Cain to Rudy Giuliani. John McCain, meanwhile, rallied from internal campaign troubles to win the 2008 Republican presidential nomination.

""October is not when you elect people,"" Bush said before hosting a town hall at a Catholic high school in Charleston. ""It's February, and then you move into March.""

Bush said his efforts now focus on four contests in February: The Iowa caucuses, the New Hampshire primary, the South Carolina primary and the Nevada caucuses. He said he is also taking aim at a March 1 group of primaries, including key southern states like Georgia and Texas.

""We have a campaign that is designed to win,"" Bush said. ""And I'm going to win.""

In discussing his campaign changes, Bush also talked about the changing nature of the Republican race. He cited a ""new phenomenon"" of candidates who have risen in the polls without any previous political experience, an apparent reference to Donald Trump and Ben Carson. He described them as ""the frontrunners right now"" who will be ""held to account, just like all of us will.""

Later Saturday morning, Bush again referred to the early Republican contests during the town hall hosted by Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., talking up the importance of South Carolina in the primary process on several occasions. ""The February states are important,"" Bush said.

Scott — who has not yet endorsed in the primary — said after the town hall he doesn't think Bush's campaign changes will hurt him in South Carolina. The senator compared the slim-down to the diet that Bush himself used to lose weight.

""I think he's doing the Paleo diet to his campaign,"" Scott said.

Also appearing at the town hall: U.S. Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., two days after chairing a hearing in which Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton testified about the 2012 terrorist attack on a U.S. facility in Benghazi, Libya.

""I don't know what y'all were doing Thursday,"" Gowdy told the supportive crowd. ""I had a rough Thursday.""

Democrats have accused Gowdy of conducting a partisan investigation designed to target Clinton's presidential campaign. Bush and Scott praised the South Carolina congressman for seeking the truth about the attack that killed four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador to Libya.

As a businessman from Birmingham, Ala., I could never imagine winding up where I am today. Yet here I am, the lead plaintiff in a case going before the U.S. Supreme Court this week — McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission. I expected to be focused more than full time on growing the electrical engineering firm I started from scratch 17 years ago. But when the federal government threatens your most fundamental constitutional rights — and your freedom of speech — it’s time to take a stand and get into politics.

Here’s what happened: As an activist, I naturally want to donate to candidates who share my views. I was doing just that during the 2010 election cycle when an Alabama GOP committee warned I might be nearing my contribution limit. Contribution limit? That was news to me. It turns out that decades ago, Congress put a cap on two kinds of campaign giving: how much you can donate to individual candidates and committees and how much you can give in total when you add all your donations to various candidates and committees, the so-called aggregate limit. Since then, aggregate limits have become too complex and time consuming to understand, both in terms of what they are and what they really do — help incumbents self-regulate and get perpetually reelected.

Story Continued Below

I understand the courts have decided that donating a maximum amount to each candidate or committee won’t cause political corruption. But what makes no sense to me, and what my case is solely about, are the aggregate limits. Somehow, I can give the individual limit, now $2,600, to 17 candidates without corrupting the system. But as soon as I give that same amount to an 18th candidate, our democracy is suddenly at risk. Only politicians in Washington could come up with something so absurd. Think about it: If a $2,600 contribution won’t corrupt 17 candidates, then the same size contribution wouldn’t corrupt 18 … or 28 … or 38.

In fact, we will fight political corruption by having the freedom to spend on more candidates whom we support with more competition in the process. Good candidates who aren’t rich can raise more money and challenge entrenched insiders. Right now, the aggregate limits add to the advantages that incumbents already have in public office. With more time and donors, they amass huge war chests because special interests place their bets on the incumbent waltzing to victory. That’s a very safe bet, by the way, since roughly 90 percent of incumbents win reelection time and again. It helps those odds that incumbents typically have about half their staff working on their reelection, and that they get a ton of free media throughout their time in office.

So how can they ensure elections remain uncompetitive? How about limiting the amount of money that challengers can get from potential supporters? Aggregate limits do exactly that because politically active donors donate to incumbents first, long before they even have challengers in the cycle, and it’s those marginal dollars that aren’t there when challengers need funds. And while candidates and parties are accountable to voters and are going to be there even after elections, forcing campaign spending away from them and into super PACs creates less accountability.

Then there’s the argument that if the aggregate limits are done away with, political candidates will be showered with seven-figure checks through what are called Joint Fundraising Committees. Really? It would require that many hundreds of candidates for the Senate and House be part of the same Joint Fundraising Committee. That’s like herding wild elephants with a baton. Joint committees can happen now, but only a few have more than two or three participants, and the largest had 33 — it got cut in half after its first election. And for good reasons: Those committees are far too unwieldy and impractical to serve more than a handful of campaigns. So supporters of aggregate limits can scream about seven-figure checks, but the rest of us shouldn’t hold our breath waiting for megadonations. After all, they aren’t happening now even with the current limit of $48,600 to all candidates!

More than any other reason, I am bringing this case to the Supreme Court because I love my country and ideas that it represents. The U.S. Constitution makes it clear that nothing is more sacred than the rights and freedoms of the individual. It is no coincidence that freedom of speech is enshrined in the very First Amendment, and since the earliest days of our republic we have been able to express that freedom by contributing money to the political candidates of our choosing. When there is no compelling reason to take basic freedom away from us, it must be protected first and foremost.

The message that I am taking to the Supreme Court is therefore a simple one. Getting rid of aggregate limits is not about corrupting democracy — it is about practicing democracy and being free.

Now how much campaigns raise — and from whom — is a big part of the political message .
This week , each 2020 campaign ’ s financial filings with the Federal Election Commission , the regulatory agency that enforces campaign finance laws , become public . In other words , we will know just how much this packed field of presidential hopefuls is fundraising , where they ’ re spending , who their biggest donors are , and more .
Candidates have begun releasing selective pieces of information in advance of the Monday deadline . We already know that Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-VT ) is leading the pack , hauling in $ 18 million in donations , and that Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( D-MA ) said she raised about a third of that . Some other campaigns aren ’ t talking about their fundraising numbers at all .
But now campaigns can ’ t hide how they ’ re doing . Legally , they need to log a record of their finances for the first quarter of 2019 , January 1 to April 1 , and this is the first real look into the guts of their operations . Here ’ s what you need to know to read these early filings .
Five things to look for when reading the FEC filings tea leaves
There are always a lot of numbers flying around when these reports come out .
1 ) How much money do they have — and how much can they actually use
Campaigns reveal three topline numbers . One is the total receipts , the sum of all the money they ’ ve raised and transferred to the campaign ; another is total contributions ; lastly is the campaign ’ s cash on hand .
Obviously , the headline figure is the total amount raised — although in the first quarter of a cycle , it ’ s not exactly an apples-to-apples comparison because candidates announce at different times and some have had longer to raise money than others have .
Candidates may also be transferring money from Senate or House campaigns to their presidential campaigns . For example , while Sanders ’ s campaign has reported raising $ 18.2 million in contributions , it currently has $ 28 million in the bank , having transferred the additional cash from his Senate campaign .
The total receipts figure can also be inflated by raising money for a general election simultaneously : Invitations seen by Recode for events for Sen. Amy Klobuchar ( D-MN ) , for instance , show that she is at least sometimes raising up to $ 5,600 a head — primary and general election dollars — which could lead to a more eye-popping topline figure but isn ’ t relevant in assessing her competitiveness in the primary . Invitations obtained to Kamala Harris ’ s ( D-CA ) or Cory Booker ’ s ( D-NJ ) events , for instance , only show hosts committing to $ 2,800 checks , which means they ’ re only raising for the primary so far .
While total contributors numbers can signal fundraising prowess and enthusiasm for a candidate , their “ cash on hand ” is the money that ’ s in the bank and can still be spent ( it does not include outstanding debts ) . With candidates staring down two years of intense campaigning , what they have in the bank might make or break their competitiveness in the long run — but at this early point in the cycle , it ’ s really just about building a base of financial support .
To keep that in perspective , by the end of the 2016 election , Hillary Clinton ’ s campaign had spent 98 percent of what it had raised , and Donald Trump ’ s campaign had spent 99 percent of what it had raised .
2 ) Whether the money is coming from big donors or small ones
There ’ s a big difference between campaigns backed primarily by maxed-out donors , who are not a well that can be tapped again and again , and small-dollar givers , who could power a longer race . A lot of campaigns like to play games that spin with how much of their money comes from the latter .
Here ’ s the conventional gold standard : What percent of the total money raised comes from increments less than $ 200 ? We know the sum of those donations from the line that shares the total number of “ unitemized ” contributions in the FEC reports . Watch out for campaigns that parrot the percentage of their contributions that are less than $ 200 — which isn ’ t the same statistic ( for instance , what if 50 people gave $ 1 but then one donor gave $ 2,800 ? ) The sometimes self-reported “ average contribution ” figure can also tell you something .
And here ’ s why this all matters : If a campaign is funded primarily by $ 2,800 checks , then sure , it might have a burst of initial money , but unless those rich people are preparing to tap their network and bundle donations from other rich people ( which they might ! ) , it ’ s hard to keep that pace over a year-long primary . Compare that to a network of small-dollar givers who are willing to give $ 50 every month , or every time you have a viral moment , or every time you win a primary or caucus .
Having more money than less is better , but all other things being equal , candidates want fundraising numbers that look to be sustainable .
Even if campaigns can ’ t boast the biggest topline numbers , some are already bragging about how many contributors they have . In many ways , this is the most important metric in the packed Democratic primary , where each candidate wants to show they have the biggest base of support in the field .
If you ’ re looking for an early read on candidates ’ breadth of support that can ’ t be captured in polling , the total number of contributors ( importantly , not contributions ! ) is a pretty good metric . In fact , reaching the threshold of 65,000 contributors is one of the criteria to qualify for the Democratic primary debates .
For example , when Beto O ’ Rourke jumped into the race , he raised more money than any other Democratic presidential candidate in the first 24 hours after announcing his 2020 bid , but he didn ’ t have as many donors as Sanders did . Sanders ’ s campaign sent out an email with the subject line : “ Bad news : Beto outraised us . Good news : we probably had a lot more donations . ”
And they were right — Sanders so far has been dominating the Democratic primary in terms of total donors , announcing 525,000 individual contributors .
To be sure , not all donors are created equal . We ’ ll also be scouting the reports for any particularly notable names who have cut major checks to Democratic candidates since it shows how some elites are judging various aspirants .
Has Booker succeeded in turning his Silicon Valley connections into boldfaced backers ? Do Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand ’ s ( D-NY ) ties to Wall Street financiers still pay off ? And how many of the Democratic Party ’ s most established megadonors — think George Soros , Tom Steyer , Michael Bloomberg , or Dustin Moskovitz — remain on the sidelines in this sprawling field ?
With very few candidate-specific Super PACs and more ability than ever to raise money online , money from these donors doesn ’ t always mean what it once did . But support from high-dollar donors is revealing of both whom the party establishment sees as its candidate and who could have staying power in the race even if they fall out of the mainstream conversation and can no longer draw on small-dollar donors .
Some of the most interesting data in FEC reports is the revelations about how various campaigns are spending their money — snapshots into the guts of how a campaign is organized and what it ’ s prioritizing .

And yeah , you might be raising tons of money , but are you spending tons to raise it with costly list rentals or consulting fees ?
That last question reveals a so-called “ burn rate , ” or how lean an operation runs . Early on in a race , you generally want to see a thrifty operation that is spending money responsibly . But what the cash is being spent on also matters — is it on field operatives who directly engage with voters , or television ad makers pulling in pricey monthly retainers ?
The politics of money in politics has shifted dramatically over the past two election cycles .
In 2016 , Republicans and their allied Super PACs raced in a dollar-for-dollar , donor-by-donor rivalry to build the largest possible war chest during the primary . Then-candidate Trump made waves by claiming to self-fund his Republican primary campaign — and beat them all .
By the end of the 2016 presidential primary , the country was well aware that Sanders ’ s average campaign donation was $ 27 . Sanders popularized running without corporate PAC donations — something almost all 2020 contenders have felt pressure to conform to .
Warren has taken this pledge even further in the 2020 election cycle , swearing off high-dollar fundraisers and phone calls with wealthy donors during the primary , saying her campaign “ will be run on the principle of equal access for anybody who joins it . ”
She ’ s getting at the core of what campaign finance reform activists see as wrong with the American political system ; as Jeff Stein wrote for ███ in 2016 , the problem with big money in politics “ is not that it creates a quid pro quo in which donors are transactionally rewarded for their gifts , but that it elevates the priorities of the wealthy across the board . ”
It helps that that ’ s an incredibly politically popular talking point ; a 2018 Pew Research Center report found that an overwhelming majority of Americans — 77 percent — thought there should be limits on the amount of money “ individuals and organizations ” can spend on political campaigns . Sixty-five percent of Americans said new laws should be written to reflect that . House Democrats , when they took back the majority in 2018 , even made campaign finance reform their first piece of legislation .
That said , this has been a push and pull in the Democratic Party at large . In 2016 , the Democratic National Committee did away with the Obama-era ban on corporate PAC donations . The DNC voted against reinstating the ban for the 2020 presidential cycle .
The 2020 candidate ’ s first FEC filings is an early look at how they are translating this rhetoric around money and politics into actual campaign practice .","Raising money used to be a behind-the-scenes part of politics. Now how much campaigns raise — and from whom — is a big part of the political message.

This week, each 2020 campaign’s financial filings with the Federal Election Commission, the regulatory agency that enforces campaign finance laws, become public. In other words, we will know just how much this packed field of presidential hopefuls is fundraising, where they’re spending, who their biggest donors are, and more.

Candidates have begun releasing selective pieces of information in advance of the Monday deadline. We already know that Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) is leading the pack, hauling in $18 million in donations, and that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said she raised about a third of that. Some other campaigns aren’t talking about their fundraising numbers at all.

But now campaigns can’t hide how they’re doing. Legally, they need to log a record of their finances for the first quarter of 2019, January 1 to April 1, and this is the first real look into the guts of their operations. Here’s what you need to know to read these early filings.

Five things to look for when reading the FEC filings tea leaves

There are always a lot of numbers flying around when these reports come out.

1) How much money do they have — and how much can they actually use

Campaigns reveal three topline numbers. One is the total receipts, the sum of all the money they’ve raised and transferred to the campaign; another is total contributions; lastly is the campaign’s cash on hand.

Obviously, the headline figure is the total amount raised — although in the first quarter of a cycle, it’s not exactly an apples-to-apples comparison because candidates announce at different times and some have had longer to raise money than others have.

Candidates may also be transferring money from Senate or House campaigns to their presidential campaigns. For example, while Sanders’s campaign has reported raising $18.2 million in contributions, it currently has $28 million in the bank, having transferred the additional cash from his Senate campaign.

The total receipts figure can also be inflated by raising money for a general election simultaneously: Invitations seen by Recode for events for Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), for instance, show that she is at least sometimes raising up to $5,600 a head — primary and general election dollars — which could lead to a more eye-popping topline figure but isn’t relevant in assessing her competitiveness in the primary. Invitations obtained to Kamala Harris’s (D-CA) or Cory Booker’s (D-NJ) events, for instance, only show hosts committing to $2,800 checks, which means they’re only raising for the primary so far.

While total contributors numbers can signal fundraising prowess and enthusiasm for a candidate, their “cash on hand” is the money that’s in the bank and can still be spent (it does not include outstanding debts). With candidates staring down two years of intense campaigning, what they have in the bank might make or break their competitiveness in the long run — but at this early point in the cycle, it’s really just about building a base of financial support.

To keep that in perspective, by the end of the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton’s campaign had spent 98 percent of what it had raised, and Donald Trump’s campaign had spent 99 percent of what it had raised.

2) Whether the money is coming from big donors or small ones

The topline figure only tells you so much, though.

There’s a big difference between campaigns backed primarily by maxed-out donors, who are not a well that can be tapped again and again, and small-dollar givers, who could power a longer race. A lot of campaigns like to play games that spin with how much of their money comes from the latter.

Here’s the conventional gold standard: What percent of the total money raised comes from increments less than $200? We know the sum of those donations from the line that shares the total number of “unitemized” contributions in the FEC reports. Watch out for campaigns that parrot the percentage of their contributions that are less than $200 — which isn’t the same statistic (for instance, what if 50 people gave $1 but then one donor gave $2,800?) The sometimes self-reported “average contribution” figure can also tell you something.

And here’s why this all matters: If a campaign is funded primarily by $2,800 checks, then sure, it might have a burst of initial money, but unless those rich people are preparing to tap their network and bundle donations from other rich people (which they might!), it’s hard to keep that pace over a year-long primary. Compare that to a network of small-dollar givers who are willing to give $50 every month, or every time you have a viral moment, or every time you win a primary or caucus.

Having more money than less is better, but all other things being equal, candidates want fundraising numbers that look to be sustainable.

3) Are a lot of people donating?

Even if campaigns can’t boast the biggest topline numbers, some are already bragging about how many contributors they have. In many ways, this is the most important metric in the packed Democratic primary, where each candidate wants to show they have the biggest base of support in the field.

If you’re looking for an early read on candidates’ breadth of support that can’t be captured in polling, the total number of contributors (importantly, not contributions!) is a pretty good metric. In fact, reaching the threshold of 65,000 contributors is one of the criteria to qualify for the Democratic primary debates.

For example, when Beto O’Rourke jumped into the race, he raised more money than any other Democratic presidential candidate in the first 24 hours after announcing his 2020 bid, but he didn’t have as many donors as Sanders did. Sanders’s campaign sent out an email with the subject line: “Bad news: Beto outraised us. Good news: we probably had a lot more donations.”

And they were right — Sanders so far has been dominating the Democratic primary in terms of total donors, announcing 525,000 individual contributors.

4) Notable donors to watch for

To be sure, not all donors are created equal. We’ll also be scouting the reports for any particularly notable names who have cut major checks to Democratic candidates since it shows how some elites are judging various aspirants.

Has Booker succeeded in turning his Silicon Valley connections into boldfaced backers? Do Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand’s (D-NY) ties to Wall Street financiers still pay off? And how many of the Democratic Party’s most established megadonors — think George Soros, Tom Steyer, Michael Bloomberg, or Dustin Moskovitz — remain on the sidelines in this sprawling field?

With very few candidate-specific Super PACs and more ability than ever to raise money online, money from these donors doesn’t always mean what it once did. But support from high-dollar donors is revealing of both whom the party establishment sees as its candidate and who could have staying power in the race even if they fall out of the mainstream conversation and can no longer draw on small-dollar donors.

5) How quickly candidates are spending their money

Some of the most interesting data in FEC reports is the revelations about how various campaigns are spending their money — snapshots into the guts of how a campaign is organized and what it’s prioritizing. How big a staff has a candidate built? Which previously hidden Democratic heavyweight is quietly on the payroll of a campaign? And yeah, you might be raising tons of money, but are you spending tons to raise it with costly list rentals or consulting fees?

That last question reveals a so-called “burn rate,” or how lean an operation runs. Early on in a race, you generally want to see a thrifty operation that is spending money responsibly. But what the cash is being spent on also matters — is it on field operatives who directly engage with voters, or television ad makers pulling in pricey monthly retainers?

The money-in-politics game has changed

The politics of money in politics has shifted dramatically over the past two election cycles.

In 2016, Republicans and their allied Super PACs raced in a dollar-for-dollar, donor-by-donor rivalry to build the largest possible war chest during the primary. Then-candidate Trump made waves by claiming to self-fund his Republican primary campaign — and beat them all.

By the end of the 2016 presidential primary, the country was well aware that Sanders’s average campaign donation was $27. Sanders popularized running without corporate PAC donations — something almost all 2020 contenders have felt pressure to conform to.

Warren has taken this pledge even further in the 2020 election cycle, swearing off high-dollar fundraisers and phone calls with wealthy donors during the primary, saying her campaign “will be run on the principle of equal access for anybody who joins it.”

She’s getting at the core of what campaign finance reform activists see as wrong with the American political system; as Jeff Stein wrote for Vox in 2016, the problem with big money in politics “is not that it creates a quid pro quo in which donors are transactionally rewarded for their gifts, but that it elevates the priorities of the wealthy across the board.”

It helps that that’s an incredibly politically popular talking point; a 2018 Pew Research Center report found that an overwhelming majority of Americans — 77 percent — thought there should be limits on the amount of money “individuals and organizations” can spend on political campaigns. Sixty-five percent of Americans said new laws should be written to reflect that. House Democrats, when they took back the majority in 2018, even made campaign finance reform their first piece of legislation.

That said, this has been a push and pull in the Democratic Party at large. In 2016, the Democratic National Committee did away with the Obama-era ban on corporate PAC donations. The DNC voted against reinstating the ban for the 2020 presidential cycle.

campaign_finance,Townhall,2,http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2012/10/08/exposing_barack_obamas_illegal_foreign_campaign_money_loophole,Corruption: Exposing Barack Obama's Illegal Foreign Campaign Money Loophole ,2012-10-08,"Katie Pavlich, Guy Benson, Julio Rosas, ""Cortney OBrien"", Leah Barkoukis","A new report obtained by ███ from the non-partisan Government Accountability Institute [ GAI ] shows the Obama campaign has potentially violated federal election law by failing to prevent the use of fraudulent or foreign credit card transactions on the official Obama for America [ OFA ] donation webpage .
For the past eight months , GAI has been investigating the potential influence of foreign online campaign donations in House , Senate and presidential elections . The report was conducted using spidering software and found thousands of foreign sites linking to campaign donation pages . The investigation was conducted with the guidance of a former U.S. attorney . GAI is led by Peter Schweizer , who recently exposed congressional insider trading in his book Throw Them All Out .
“ As FBI surveillance tapes have previously shown , foreign governments understand and are eager to exploit the weaknesses of American campaigns , ” the report says . “ This , combined with the Internet ’ s ability to disintermediate campaign contributions on a mass scale , as well as outmoded and lax Federal Election Commission rules , make U.S. elections vulnerable to foreign influence . ”
OFA seems to be taking advantage of a “ foreign donor loophole ” by not using CVV on their campaign donation page . When you donate online to the Obama campaign using a credit card , the contribution webpage does not require donors to enter a secure CVV number ( also known as CSC , CVV2 or CVN ) , the three-digit securing code on the back of credit cards . This code , although not 100 percent effective , is used to ensure a person making a purchase physically possesses the card . According to the report , 90 percent of e-commerce and 19 of the 20 largest charities in the United States use a CVV code , making its use standard industry practice in order to prevent fraud . Another anti-fraud security measure includes software , better known as an Address Verification System , to verify a donor ’ s address matches the address on file with the credit card company . The investigation could not determine whether OFA is using this type of software to prevent fraudulent or illegal donations .
Because of the lack of a CVV code requirement , the door is opened for OFA to accept robo-donations , or in other words , large numbers of small and automatic donations made online to evade FEC reporting requirements . Although it isn ’ t illegal to decline the use of a secure CVV credit card code for campaign donations , it is illegal to accept campaign donations from foreign sources . Campaigns are required under criminal code not to solicit , accept or receive foreign donations in any amount . The Federal Elections Commission doesn ’ t require campaigns to disclose the names of donors making contributions of less than $ 200 unless audited . In addition , FEC rules don ’ t require campaigns to keep records of those giving less than $ 50 . These rules combined with the lack of a CVV numbers make it easy for campaigns to get away with taking foreign donations .
According to GAI , it is the duty of the campaign to “ ensure compliance with the law . Indeed , they risk criminal prosecution for the conscious failure to do so . This means that whether or not the FEC requires it to be reported , campaigns have an independent duty under the law to discover and protect against criminal campaign contributions. ” Protecting against criminal campaign contributions is easily accomplished by requiring a CVV code on the campaign donation page .
OFA has specifically touted its “ grassroots ” success by showcasing the majority of its donations coming from those giving less than $ 200 . It appears the campaign also solicits funds for less than $ 200 in order to avoid having to report the name of the person making a donation under FEC rules . The GAI documents included the following email from Barack Obama to campaign supporters :
A large part of the Team Obama operation is outsourced . More than 200 domain names with the word “ Obama ” in the web address have been purchased . The most significant of these websites may be Obama.com , which is owned by an Obama bundler in Shanghai , China with “ questionable business ties to state-run Chinese enterprises , ” according to the report .
Obama.com was purchased in 2008 , and , although Obama.com is owned by a third party , not the campaign itself , the site redirects its foreign traffic , a whopping 68 percent , directly to the official Obama for America campaign donation page . The Obama campaign ’ s official and main website , BarackObama.com , sees 43 percent of its traffic coming from foreign IP addresses , according to web metrics firm Markosweb and noted in the report .
According to industry leading web analytics site Markosweb , an anonymously registered redirect site ( Obama.com ) features 68 % foreign traffic . Starting in December 2011 , the site was linked to a specific donation page on the official BarackObama.com campaign website for ten months . The page loaded a tracking number , 634930 , into a space on the website labeled `` who encouraged you to make this donation . '' That tracking number is embedded in the source code for Obama.com and is associated with the Obama Victory Fund . In early September 2012 , the page began redirecting to the standard Obama Victory Fund donation page . Search engine optimization ( SEO ) efforts , using common spamming techniques , may have been undertaken by unknown third-parties , generating foreign traffic to Obama.com .
China has a long history of trying to illegally influence American elections . Their efforts were most prominent in the 1990s .
In the past , foreign governments have relied on middlemen to transfer illegal campaign contributions . With the explosion of Internet campaign fundraising , the prospect of foreign powers , criminal gangs , foreign individuals , or domestic fraudsters making direct campaign contributions to American elections becomes far more likely . Put simply , campaign fundraising crimes are now just a click away . Rather than risking detection or relying on a middleman , donations can be anonymously donated through campaign websites . The state of Internet security of many political campaigns ’ websites leaves American elections vulnerable to fraud or foreign influence .
Is the non-use of CVV code verification simply an oversight or mistake made by Obama for America ? Most likely , no . The Obama campaign is willing to pay millions in fees in order to accept unsecured contributions on their donation page without the CVV code . Attorney Kenneth Sukhia analyzed the GAI ’ s findings and this revelation in the following way in a separate report .
“ As GAI points out , if a campaign is truly seeking to do all it can to prevent illicit contributions , there is no reason not to employ these basic fraud prevention tools . First , these tools are easily installed , and once set up , operate with a minimum of administrative oversight by the vendor . They are fully automated , but can be easily re-calibrated as called for . “
“ Under these circumstances , a campaign ’ s decision to turn off either of these systems despite the increased fees raises legitimate questions as to a campaign ’ s knowing failure to use its best efforts to comply with the laws prohibiting foreign contributions . Indeed , it ’ s reasonable to ask why any campaign would ever opt to pay card issuers more for less information and less security . More importantly , why pay card issuers more when doing so lessens a campaign ’ s ability to comply with the law ? It ’ s hard to imagine any campaign would pay extra for less security and marketing intelligence , unless it stood to benefit in some way from doing so . ”
“ Because a campaign ’ s decision to opt out of the standard security measures and to pay more to receive less information about their contributors defies all conventional campaign logic , and because it is difficult to identify a more plausible motive , there is reason to suspect that such decisions may be motivated by the belief that more money could be raised through foreign contributions than lost in added fees by declining security tools designed to stop them . ”
OFA isn ’ t run by amateurs and has a highly sophisticated online presence . OFA is known as the “ gold standard ” in online technology with a Facebook co-founder , veteran YouTube videographer and an award-winning CNN producer keeping everything running smoothly .
Not to mention , the campaign obviously sees the benefits in using a CVV code to prevent fraud . After all , OFA uses a CVV security code for merchandise purchases . To purchase a sweatshirt or other item in the OFA store , a CVV code must be entered at check out , but the donation page does not require a credit card security code to be used . In addition , the chief technology officer of the Obama campaign , Harper Reed , is a former chief technology officer of the T-shirt company Threadless . Threadless requires a CVV code for online purchases . They clearly know how CVV codes work .
As of September 26 , 2012 , the Obama campaign has raised $ 271,327,755 in contributions under $ 200 for the 2012 cycle . In 2008 , it was $ 335,139,233 . The Romney campaign has raised just $ 58,456,968 in contributions under $ 200 and has all CVV and online security measures in place . In total , the Obama campaign raised $ 500 million online in 2008 with $ 335 million in contributions -- more than half -- falling under the $ 200 reporting requirement . Obama has raised more online funds than any campaign in history .
As reported over the weekend , the Obama campaign raised $ 181 million in September alone -- only 2 percent of those donations are required to be reported to the FEC .
The campaign said that just over 1.8 million people made donations to the campaign last month . According to the campaign , over 500k of these were brand-new donors , having neither given in 2008 nor 2012 . 98 % of contributions were under the reporting threshold of $ 250 . Of these , the average contribution was $ 53 . [ It 's ] really a tale of two worlds . 35k people gave an average of $ 2,600 , while just over 1.7 million people gave an average of $ 53 . Half the campaign 's haul came from people giving around the maximum amount and half from people who do n't have to be disclosed . Seems a bit odd . The average of $ 53 from small donors is particularly noteworthy . Contributions under $ 200 do n't have to be disclosed , but the campaign still has to keep track of the donor 's name , in case subsequent donations push their contribution over the reporting threshold . For contributions under $ 50 , however , the campaign does n't even have to keep track of the donor 's name . It is effectively considered a `` petty cash '' donation . A person could theoretically make 10 $ 49 donations and never be reported , even though their total contributions are above the FEC 's reporting threshold . With an average donation of $ 53 from small donors , Obama has A LOT of donors who will never be disclosed and whose names are n't even known to the campaign . Tens of millions of dollars worth .
As previously mentioned , the GAI report mentions campaigns have an obligation to protect against illegal campaign contributions . The law under U.S. Code makes it illegal for campaigns or political committees to accept direct or indirect contributions of money from foreign nationals . It is also illegal for a campaign or committee to “ solicit , accept , or receive a contribution from a foreign national . '' Penalties for violations are stiff , according to the report .
While no person can be held accountable under the law for violations he or she is powerless to prevent or for violations of which a person had no knowledge , the law recognizes that to permit meaningful enforcement a person can not escape responsibility for a crime by deliberately ignoring facts and circumstances that would lead a reasonable person to conclude that a crime is most likely being committed . Moreover , the FEC regulations make it clear that a campaign official can not avoid criminal culpability by ignoring facts that would lead a reasonable person to inquire whether foreign nationals are contributing funds to the campaign .
DIRECT SOLICITATIONS FROM OFA TO FOREIGN NATIONALS AND THE ONLINE PAPER TRAIL
The internet for the Obama campaign has proved to be a cash cow , but it 's also provided a digital paper trail of potential illegal activity for investigators . When foreign bloggers received donation solicitations from the Obama campaign , they wrote about it online . GAI found their sites and documented their experiences . Social media accomplished the same thing -- an online trail of Obama campaign solicitations to foreign nationals .
1 . In July and August , a Chinese blogger reposts letters he has received from the Obama campaign , each of which contains a solicitation for $ 3 or $ 5 ( note that these smaller donations don ’ t require the campaign to keep any record of them ) .118 Markosweb states that 87.8 % of the traffic flowing to the site comes from China while only 4.5 % is from the United States . The website contains hyperlinks that lead to the campaign ’ s donation page . The website also contains graphics showing the disparity between Romney ’ s and the President ’ s fundraising and a countdown clock to the date of the election . Other than the campaign solicitation letters , the website is in Chinese characters .
2 . On August 9th , 2012 the Obama campaign sent a solicitation letter to “ Hikemt Hadjy-Zadh , ” an Azerbaijani citizen . His email address is on an Azerbaijani domain and he posts numerous solicitation letters he has received from the Obama campaign . Mr. Hadjy-Zadh reposts the complete letters on a discussion forum , including numerous hyperlinks that go directly to the campaign ’ s donation page .
3 . A writer in Vietnam writes on a website for the Vietnam Institute for Development Studies ( a government-backed think tank ) and posts emails he has received from my.barackobama.com with more than 24 total links to the campaign ’ s donate page embedded in the emails . The website is in the Vietnamese language , hosted on a Vietnamese server , and uses a Vietnamese domain address . In one instance , a letter from Mitch Stewart , Director of the Obama campaign ’ s “ Organizing for America , ” asks for donations . Ironically , Stewart laments that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is reportedly taking money from foreign sources . The reader is then prompted to give his name and email address and thereafter begins receiving solicitation letters for donations .
4 . A Dutch blogger writing in Dutch on a Dutch website reprints an email from March 22 , 2010 in which President Obama thanks his supporters for their help . “ You ’ re welcome , Mr. President , ” he writes back .
5 . The Dutch blog “ His Dirk ” received a donation request from the campaign . Aware of the U.S. law , the blogger decided not to contribute . The blogger observed , “ I imagine many non- Americans have money transferred to the Obama campaign . It ’ s just too easy . ”
6 . A member of the Italian Radical Socialist movement and an administrator of their website reposts solicitations from the Obama campaign which he reports receiving regularly for three years . “ And because we are three years in his mailing list ... But frankly after 3 years his letters excite me much less ... ”
7 . A Japanese blogger named Isogaya posts a link to the Obama campaign ’ s donation page . When posting the link , Isogaya notes that an option in giving would be to give a gift card .
8 . A Norwegian blogger posts a solicitation from the Obama campaign , including the link to the donate page . When another blogger opines that non-U.S. citizens can not contribute because of American law , the blogger responds in Norwegian , “ I have in practice given money to Obama , I had done it . ”
9 . A blogger in Egypt who serves on the board of the Union of Arab Bloggers posts the solicitation letters he reports to regularly receive from the Obama campaign.127 “ We as Arabs and Muslims ” support the “ Democratic party , compared to the Republican Party , ” but notes his objection to the President ’ s stand on gay marriage .
Although GAI 's findings were most prominent with Obama for America , the “ CCV loophole ” is a problem across the political spectrum . The report found nearly half of Congress is at least vulnerable to fraud and foreign donations .
Of the 446 House and Senate members who have an online donation page , 47.3 % do not require the three or four digit credit card security number ( officially called the Card Verification Value , or the CVV ) for Internet contributions .
During his run for U.S. Senate , then Republican candidate Marco Rubio ’ s campaign donation website didn ’ t have CVV protection . The protection was put in place in May 2012 after the campaign was over . The report alleges the connection to foreign websites could be a violation of the Federal Election Commission solicitation laws and at minimum put Rubio at risk for fraud in his campaign .
The Government Accountability Institute found considerable international interest in the Rubio campaign , including significant foreign traffic going to the website marcorubioforussenate.com . Links on foreign websites often took the form of videos that featured links to “ donate ” to the Rubio campaign .
Sukhia also mentioned the Rubio campaign in his anaylsis of the report .
“ The Government Accountability Institute found considerable international interest in the Rubio campaign , including significant foreign traffic going to the website marcorubioforussenate.com . ”
“ GAI found numerous video links on foreign websites that featured running ads to “ donate ” to the Rubio campaign . ”
Although campaigns may have CVV in place , organizations they take money from often times do not . For example , Massachusetts Senate candidate Elizabeth Warren has accepted more than $ 5.7 million from ActBlue , a fundraising organization that does not require U.S. citizenship verification or a CVV code when accepting contributions .
Because the problems of potential fraud due to a lack of CVV use are so widespread , GAI created a 50-state interactive map to show which members of Congress lack standard secure campaign donation websites .
In his 2010 State of the Union Address , President Obama said , “ I don ’ t think American elections should be bankrolled by America ’ s most powerful interests , and worse , by foreign entities . ”
In this situation , the foreign donation problem coming from online sources can be solved and President Obama ’ s promise of transparency can be kept in one click by enabling all security protections and releasing the names and records on all transactions under $ 200 to verify Obama for America is a clean campaign operating within FEC law .
Overall , major reforms are needed to ensure foreign contributions are not interfering with or influencing elections in the United States .","A new report obtained by Townhall from the non-partisan Government Accountability Institute [GAI] shows the Obama campaign has potentially violated federal election law by failing to prevent the use of fraudulent or foreign credit card transactions on the official Obama for America [OFA] donation webpage.

When you donate online to the Obama campaign using a credit card, the contribution webpage does not require donors to enter a secure CVV number (also known as CSC, CVV2 or CVN), the three-digit securing code on the back of credit cards. This code, although not 100 percent effective, is used to ensure a person making a purchase physically possesses the card. According to the report, 90 percent of e-commerce and 19 of the 20 largest charities in the United States use a CVV code, making its use standard industry practice in order to prevent fraud. Another anti-fraud security measure includes software, better known as an Address Verification System, to verify a donor’s address matches the address on file with the credit card company. The investigation could not determine whether OFA is using this type of software to prevent fraudulent or illegal donations.



Because of the lack of a CVV code requirement, the door is opened for OFA to accept robo-donations, or in other words, large numbers of small and automatic donations made online to evade FEC reporting requirements. Although it isn’t illegal to decline the use of a secure CVV credit card code for campaign donations, it is illegal to accept campaign donations from foreign sources. Campaigns are required under criminal code not to solicit, accept or receive foreign donations in any amount. The Federal Elections Commission doesn’t require campaigns to disclose the names of donors making contributions of less than $200 unless audited. In addition, FEC rules don’t require campaigns to keep records of those giving less than $50. These rules combined with the lack of a CVV numbers make it easy for campaigns to get away with taking foreign donations.

According to GAI, it is the duty of the campaign to “ensure compliance with the law. Indeed, they risk criminal prosecution for the conscious failure to do so. This means that whether or not the FEC requires it to be reported, campaigns have an independent duty under the law to discover and protect against criminal campaign contributions.” Protecting against criminal campaign contributions is easily accomplished by requiring a CVV code on the campaign donation page.

OFA has specifically touted its “grassroots” success by showcasing the majority of its donations coming from those giving less than $200. It appears the campaign also solicits funds for less than $200 in order to avoid having to report the name of the person making a donation under FEC rules. The GAI documents included the following email from Barack Obama to campaign supporters:









IT ALL ADDS UP



A large part of the Team Obama operation is outsourced. More than 200 domain names with the word “Obama” in the web address have been purchased. The most significant of these websites may be Obama.com, which is owned by an Obama bundler in Shanghai, China with “questionable business ties to state-run Chinese enterprises,” according to the report.



Obama.com was purchased in 2008, and, although Obama.com is owned by a third party, not the campaign itself, the site redirects its foreign traffic, a whopping 68 percent, directly to the official Obama for America campaign donation page. The Obama campaign’s official and main website, BarackObama.com, sees 43 percent of its traffic coming from foreign IP addresses, according to web metrics firm Markosweb and noted in the report.

According to industry leading web analytics site Markosweb, an anonymously registered redirect site (Obama.com) features 68 % foreign traffic. Starting in December 2011, the site was linked to a specific donation page on the official BarackObama.com campaign website for ten months. The page loaded a tracking number, 634930, into a space on the website labeled ""who encouraged you to make this donation."" That tracking number is embedded in the source code for Obama.com and is associated with the Obama Victory Fund. In early September 2012, the page began redirecting to the standard Obama Victory Fund donation page. Search engine optimization (SEO) efforts, using common spamming techniques, may have been undertaken by unknown third-parties, generating foreign traffic to Obama.com.

China has a long history of trying to illegally influence American elections. Their efforts were most prominent in the 1990s.

In the past, foreign governments have relied on middlemen to transfer illegal campaign contributions. With the explosion of Internet campaign fundraising, the prospect of foreign powers, criminal gangs, foreign individuals, or domestic fraudsters making direct campaign contributions to American elections becomes far more likely. Put simply, campaign fundraising crimes are now just a click away. Rather than risking detection or relying on a middleman, donations can be anonymously donated through campaign websites. The state of Internet security of many political campaigns’ websites leaves American elections vulnerable to fraud or foreign influence.

AN HONEST MISTAKE, OR SOMETHING MORE?

Is the non-use of CVV code verification simply an oversight or mistake made by Obama for America? Most likely, no. The Obama campaign is willing to pay millions in fees in order to accept unsecured contributions on their donation page without the CVV code. Attorney Kenneth Sukhia analyzed the GAI’s findings and this revelation in the following way in a separate report.

“As GAI points out, if a campaign is truly seeking to do all it can to prevent illicit contributions, there is no reason not to employ these basic fraud prevention tools. First, these tools are easily installed, and once set up, operate with a minimum of administrative oversight by the vendor. They are fully automated, but can be easily re-calibrated as called for. “

“Under these circumstances, a campaign’s decision to turn off either of these systems despite the increased fees raises legitimate questions as to a campaign’s knowing failure to use its best efforts to comply with the laws prohibiting foreign contributions. Indeed, it’s reasonable to ask why any campaign would ever opt to pay card issuers more for less information and less security. More importantly, why pay card issuers more when doing so lessens a campaign’s ability to comply with the law? It’s hard to imagine any campaign would pay extra for less security and marketing intelligence, unless it stood to benefit in some way from doing so.”

“Because a campaign’s decision to opt out of the standard security measures and to pay more to receive less information about their contributors defies all conventional campaign logic, and because it is difficult to identify a more plausible motive, there is reason to suspect that such decisions may be motivated by the belief that more money could be raised through foreign contributions than lost in added fees by declining security tools designed to stop them.”

OFA isn’t run by amateurs and has a highly sophisticated online presence. OFA is known as the “gold standard” in online technology with a Facebook co-founder, veteran YouTube videographer and an award-winning CNN producer keeping everything running smoothly.



Not to mention, the campaign obviously sees the benefits in using a CVV code to prevent fraud. After all, OFA uses a CVV security code for merchandise purchases. To purchase a sweatshirt or other item in the OFA store, a CVV code must be entered at check out, but the donation page does not require a credit card security code to be used. In addition, the chief technology officer of the Obama campaign, Harper Reed, is a former chief technology officer of the T-shirt company Threadless. Threadless requires a CVV code for online purchases. They clearly know how CVV codes work.



THE NUMBERS



As of September 26, 2012, the Obama campaign has raised $271,327,755 in contributions under $200 for the 2012 cycle. In 2008, it was $335,139,233. The Romney campaign has raised just $58,456,968 in contributions under $200 and has all CVV and online security measures in place. In total, the Obama campaign raised $500 million online in 2008 with $335 million in contributions--more than half--falling under the $200 reporting requirement. Obama has raised more online funds than any campaign in history.

As reported over the weekend, the Obama campaign raised $181 million in September alone--only 2 percent of those donations are required to be reported to the FEC.

The campaign said that just over 1.8 million people made donations to the campaign last month. According to the campaign, over 500k of these were brand-new donors, having neither given in 2008 nor 2012. 98% of contributions were under the reporting threshold of $250. Of these, the average contribution was $53. [It's] really a tale of two worlds. 35k people gave an average of $2,600, while just over 1.7 million people gave an average of $53. Half the campaign's haul came from people giving around the maximum amount and half from people who don't have to be disclosed. Seems a bit odd. The average of $53 from small donors is particularly noteworthy. Contributions under $200 don't have to be disclosed, but the campaign still has to keep track of the donor's name, in case subsequent donations push their contribution over the reporting threshold. For contributions under $50, however, the campaign doesn't even have to keep track of the donor's name. It is effectively considered a ""petty cash"" donation. A person could theoretically make 10 $49 donations and never be reported, even though their total contributions are above the FEC's reporting threshold. With an average donation of $53 from small donors, Obama has A LOT of donors who will never be disclosed and whose names aren't even known to the campaign. Tens of millions of dollars worth.

HOW LIABLE?



As previously mentioned, the GAI report mentions campaigns have an obligation to protect against illegal campaign contributions. The law under U.S. Code makes it illegal for campaigns or political committees to accept direct or indirect contributions of money from foreign nationals. It is also illegal for a campaign or committee to “solicit, accept, or receive a contribution from a foreign national."" Penalties for violations are stiff, according to the report.

While no person can be held accountable under the law for violations he or she is powerless to prevent or for violations of which a person had no knowledge, the law recognizes that to permit meaningful enforcement a person cannot escape responsibility for a crime by deliberately ignoring facts and circumstances that would lead a reasonable person to conclude that a crime is most likely being committed. Moreover, the FEC regulations make it clear that a campaign official cannot avoid criminal culpability by ignoring facts that would lead a reasonable person to inquire whether foreign nationals are contributing funds to the campaign.

DIRECT SOLICITATIONS FROM OFA TO FOREIGN NATIONALS AND THE ONLINE PAPER TRAIL



The internet for the Obama campaign has proved to be a cash cow, but it's also provided a digital paper trail of potential illegal activity for investigators. When foreign bloggers received donation solicitations from the Obama campaign, they wrote about it online. GAI found their sites and documented their experiences. Social media accomplished the same thing--an online trail of Obama campaign solicitations to foreign nationals.



1. In July and August, a Chinese blogger reposts letters he has received from the Obama campaign, each of which contains a solicitation for $3 or $5 (note that these smaller donations don’t require the campaign to keep any record of them).118 Markosweb states that 87.8% of the traffic flowing to the site comes from China while only 4.5% is from the United States. The website contains hyperlinks that lead to the campaign’s donation page. The website also contains graphics showing the disparity between Romney’s and the President’s fundraising and a countdown clock to the date of the election. Other than the campaign solicitation letters, the website is in Chinese characters.



2. On August 9th, 2012 the Obama campaign sent a solicitation letter to “Hikemt Hadjy-Zadh,” an Azerbaijani citizen. His email address is on an Azerbaijani domain and he posts numerous solicitation letters he has received from the Obama campaign. Mr. Hadjy-Zadh reposts the complete letters on a discussion forum, including numerous hyperlinks that go directly to the campaign’s donation page.



3. A writer in Vietnam writes on a website for the Vietnam Institute for Development Studies (a government-backed think tank) and posts emails he has received from my.barackobama.com with more than 24 total links to the campaign’s donate page embedded in the emails. The website is in the Vietnamese language, hosted on a Vietnamese server, and uses a Vietnamese domain address. In one instance, a letter from Mitch Stewart, Director of the Obama campaign’s “Organizing for America,” asks for donations. Ironically, Stewart laments that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is reportedly taking money from foreign sources. The reader is then prompted to give his name and email address and thereafter begins receiving solicitation letters for donations.



4. A Dutch blogger writing in Dutch on a Dutch website reprints an email from March 22, 2010 in which President Obama thanks his supporters for their help. “You’re welcome, Mr. President,” he writes back.



5. The Dutch blog “His Dirk” received a donation request from the campaign. Aware of the U.S. law, the blogger decided not to contribute. The blogger observed, “I imagine many non- Americans have money transferred to the Obama campaign. It’s just too easy.”



6. A member of the Italian Radical Socialist movement and an administrator of their website reposts solicitations from the Obama campaign which he reports receiving regularly for three years. “And because we are three years in his mailing list...But frankly after 3 years his letters excite me much less...”



7. A Japanese blogger named Isogaya posts a link to the Obama campaign’s donation page. When posting the link, Isogaya notes that an option in giving would be to give a gift card.



8. A Norwegian blogger posts a solicitation from the Obama campaign, including the link to the donate page. When another blogger opines that non-U.S. citizens cannot contribute because of American law, the blogger responds in Norwegian,“I have in practice given money to Obama, I had done it.”



9. A blogger in Egypt who serves on the board of the Union of Arab Bloggers posts the solicitation letters he reports to regularly receive from the Obama campaign.127 “We as Arabs and Muslims” support the “Democratic party, compared to the Republican Party,” but notes his objection to the President’s stand on gay marriage.

WIDESPREAD CORRUPTION



Although GAI's findings were most prominent with Obama for America, the “CCV loophole” is a problem across the political spectrum. The report found nearly half of Congress is at least vulnerable to fraud and foreign donations.

Of the 446 House and Senate members who have an online donation page, 47.3% do not require the three or four digit credit card security number (officially called the Card Verification Value, or the CVV) for Internet contributions.

During his run for U.S. Senate, then Republican candidate Marco Rubio’s campaign donation website didn’t have CVV protection. The protection was put in place in May 2012 after the campaign was over. The report alleges the connection to foreign websites could be a violation of the Federal Election Commission solicitation laws and at minimum put Rubio at risk for fraud in his campaign.

The Government Accountability Institute found considerable international interest in the Rubio campaign, including significant foreign traffic going to the website marcorubioforussenate.com. Links on foreign websites often took the form of videos that featured links to “donate” to the Rubio campaign.

Sukhia also mentioned the Rubio campaign in his anaylsis of the report.

“The Government Accountability Institute found considerable international interest in the Rubio campaign, including significant foreign traffic going to the website marcorubioforussenate.com.”

“GAI found numerous video links on foreign websites that featured running ads to “donate” to the Rubio campaign.”

Although campaigns may have CVV in place, organizations they take money from often times do not. For example, Massachusetts Senate candidate Elizabeth Warren has accepted more than $5.7 million from ActBlue, a fundraising organization that does not require U.S. citizenship verification or a CVV code when accepting contributions.



Because the problems of potential fraud due to a lack of CVV use are so widespread, GAI created a 50-state interactive map to show which members of Congress lack standard secure campaign donation websites.



SOLUTION FOR OBAMA CAMPAIGN



In his 2010 State of the Union Address, President Obama said, “I don’t think American elections should be bankrolled by America’s most powerful interests, and worse, by foreign entities.”



In this situation, the foreign donation problem coming from online sources can be solved and President Obama’s promise of transparency can be kept in one click by enabling all security protections and releasing the names and records on all transactions under $200 to verify Obama for America is a clean campaign operating within FEC law.



Overall, major reforms are needed to ensure foreign contributions are not interfering with or influencing elections in the United States.

Gifts galore

Congress' petty cash problem Members of Congress have almost total discretion to determine what is a legitimate campaign expense. Here are some of the more unusual ways they have used donor dollars: Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Ca.): Gifts for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi from swank stores such as Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman, more than $2,000. Rep. Bob Brady (D-Pa.): Christmas gifts from Capital Grille, upwards of $10,000 per year. Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas): Servicing his BMW in Alexandria, Virginia, nearly $3,400. Sen. John Cornyn, (R-Texas): “Beverages for meal” while on a congressional delegation trip to South Africa, $336. Rep.

Louie Gohmert (R-Texas): Three expenditures at the Andaz Hotel in London in November and December, more than $5,400. Rep. Gene Green (D-Texas): Gifts for his D.C. and district staff, roughly $3,000. Retired Rep. Buck McKeon (R-Ca.): Money left in campaign post-retirement in January, $250,000.

Spending abroad

Other lawmakers have tapped their campaign kitties to travel abroad.

Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert represents a district on the eastern border of Texas, but one of his campaign line items last year was $272 for a meeting room at the Intercontinental Victoria Island in Lagos, Nigeria. In three expenditures in November and December, Gohmert paid more than $5,400 at the Andaz Hotel in London. He also spent time in Oxford at the Old Bank Hotel.

Gohmert’s spokesman, Kimberly Willingham, said Gohmert was giving political speeches in England, but did not respond to questions about whom Gohmert addressed. She suggested POLITICO write an “unbiased article about a congressman saving taxpayers significant amounts of money by legally using funds he has raised instead of taxpayer funds.”

Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican who is also from Texas, spent $336 for “beverages for meal” while on a congressional delegation trip to South Africa. Cornyn bought the drinks at La Combe in Cape Town, which is located on an organic wine estate and considered one of the top restaurants in the world. Cornyn’s office didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment.

Rep. Dan Lipinski (D-Ill.), whose district includes the suburbs Chicago, went to the Tango Hotel Roma and Villa Tucolana Roma last year, running up a bill of more than $750. A spokesman said the congressman was in Rome for the International Catholic Legislators Network conference.

Dublin, Ireland, also appeared on campaign disclosure forms. In 2013, Rep. John Larson (D-Conn.) had a “political” meal at The Merrion Hotel there that cost $112. Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.) also visited Dublin on the campaign dime in both 2011 and 2012, shelling out thousands of dollars for stays at the Shelbourne Meridien and the Westbury Hotel, and the Europa Hotel in Belfast. Neal’s office said he spoke at the Ireland-U.S. Council’s annual meeting and the annual political conference of Sinn Féin.

Other politicians have favorite dining spots in Washington that they frequent on the campaign dime. Rep. Jason Smith (R-Mo.) has gone to Smoothie King in D.C. and Missouri more than a dozen times since June.

Josh Haynes, his chief of staff, says Smith “doesn’t drink coffee, and when he meets in the morning with elected officials, donors or staff they oftentimes will get a smoothie.” However, during his campaign last year, Smith set a goal of having coffee with every member of Congress by the end of this term.

Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.), meanwhile, is a regular at Tune Inn, a dive bar blocks away from the Capitol. His campaign has foot the bill for meals there more than 20 times since September 2013, totaling more than $1,000. Sometimes the bill is as small as $20, other times $130. Grijalva’s spokesman provided receipts that show that his political director, Jose Miranda, was reimbursed for the political meals, not the congressman.

Cuellar’s office, meanwhile, says it’s perfectly permissible for his campaign to pay for repairs on his BMW in Washington. His political aide Colin Strother said he drives the vehicle 90 percent of the time for political work, including to and from the Capitol, to events on K Street and to the airport when he flies home to Laredo.

“Using campaign funds for things like maintenance and repair of a vehicle used for campaign purposes is completely legal,” Strother said.

Buck McKeon’s campaign spending is perhaps the most eye-popping — because he’s not even in Congress anymore. The California Republican retired from the House in January after more than two decades with more than a quarter of a million dollars left in his campaign coffers.

He’s used the money to pay his wife about $20,000 since Election Day. Patricia McKeon worked for the congressman for years without pay, the ex-congressman said in an interview, and she’s now helping him close out his campaign operation.

“If you average that all out over the 22 years, it’s a lot less than the indication,” the ex-congressman asserted. “People think we paid her that much forever,” he added, but the fact is “she worked for years for free.”",www.politico.com,left,jvsDxssNd0bBHyQF

Some pundits are going so far as to call the former New York City mayor ’ s actions the equivalent of a “ murder-suicide ” that devastated Trump ’ s legal defense , but how much damage did Giuliani actually do to Trump ’ s legal case ?
“ Trump is in considerably more potential legal trouble than he was before Giuliani opened his mouth , ” said Rick Hasen , a University of California at Irvine law professor and a prominent expert on campaign finance .
Other legal experts said Giuliani ’ s remarks about the arrangement between the president and Michael Cohen , his longtime personal attorney , might not have been helpful to Trump but didn ’ t really put him in greater jeopardy .
“ His comments have no impact on the legal fact that the payments by Mr. Cohen to Stormy Daniels were consistent with a long pattern of payment by businessman Trump and the Trump Organization to protect their reputation , ” said Charlie Spies , an election attorney with the Washington law firm Clark Hill . “ They don ’ t have to stop defending him just because there ’ s a campaign going on . ”

Here ’ s a look at some of the potential impacts of Giuliani ’ s dramatic disclosure and his ensuing remarks :
Does the president ’ s admission strengthen or weaken the case that the Stormy Daniels payment broke campaign finance law ?
Giuliani stressed repeatedly in interviews that the money used to reimburse Cohen came from Trump ’ s personal funds and not from any campaign account , but the critical legal question is whether the original payment to Daniels or the reimbursement were intended to advance Trump ’ s electoral chances .
“ It certainly increases Trump ’ s exposure , but we need to know more , ” Hasen said . “ If he knew about it at the time of the campaign , it looks like Trump could have committed a campaign finance violation and potentially a willful one . ”
Some legal experts disagree , arguing that a payment over an alleged affair would never or almost never be a campaign contribution that must be reported , especially where a prominent individual is involved .
“ This is financing related to an intensely intimate personal matter , and the [ campaign finance ] laws don ’ t apply , ” said Jan Baran of the D.C. law firm Wiley Rein . “ There has to be some objective way to measure whether something is campaign-related . … There was a time people would keep their personal relations like this quiet because it would be death to them politically , but that isn ’ t the case anymore , obviously . ”
One open question is what emails , recordings or other evidence seized from Cohen ’ s online accounts and his home , office and hotel room give prosecutors insights into Cohen ’ s motivation in arranging the payment in October 2016 . Indications that it was urgently necessary because of the looming election could make a charge of a legal violation more likely .
Giuliani may have unintentionally fueled that perception on Thursday morning when he noted the way that publicity about Daniels ’ claims could have hurt Trump ’ s campaign .
“ Imagine if that came out on Oct. 15 , 2016 , in the middle of the , you know , last debate with Hillary Clinton , ” Giuliani said . “ Cohen didn ’ t even ask . Cohen made it go away . He did his job . ”
“ He suggested the motive for the payment was to help Trump in the campaign , which was the last thing you ’ d want a lawyer saying on this , ” the law professor said .
Was Trump ’ s embrace of the Daniels payment a signal to Cohen not to “ flip ” and turn on the president ?
Trump ’ s defense team has been concerned in recent weeks that Cohen might agree to cooperate with federal prosecutors and seek leniency by offering them information — accurate or inaccurate — about Trump . Some analysts saw the president ’ s acknowledgment of the payment as a bid to discourage Cohen from making such a move .
“ The strategy might be , let ’ s try to keep Cohen on the president ’ s side , ” said Laurie Levenson , a former federal prosecutor who ’ s now a professor at Loyola Law School . “ There ’ s going to be enormous pressure on Cohen . Cohen might end up pointing the finger back at the president . And while he ’ s said he ’ ll be loyal , at that point , loyalty only goes so far . ”
Giuliani ’ s statement that Trump reimbursed Cohen and a later comment that Trump has known about the Daniels situation in general terms for a long time suggest that Cohen may be off the hook on a potential charge of making an illegally large in-kind donation to Trump ’ s campaign . However , if it was for campaign purposes , even a loan of the money should have been reported . It may have not been Cohen ’ s duty to report it , but he could still face a charge related to concealing it or causing it to be omitted from campaign finance reports .
“ Cohen and Trump may not have had a credible story before , but at least it was consistent , ” said Peter Zeidenberg , a former federal prosecutor now with the D.C. law firm Arent Fox . “ Now , they ’ ve junked it all . I think it ’ s a mess , and it doesn ’ t get him out of the soup . I don ’ t understand the value at all . ”
Could Trump face other charges like bank fraud or structuring ?
One drawback to the strategy reflected in Giuliani ’ s statements is that they tie Trump more closely with Cohen , who ’ s known to be under investigation for possible bank and wire fraud , in addition to campaign finance violations . It seems unlikely that Trump would be involved in some aspects of Cohen ’ s financial affairs known to be under scrutiny , like financing for taxi medallions .
There has been some speculation about Trump ’ s facing legal jeopardy because , according to Giuliani , Cohen was reimbursed in $ 35,000 increments . However , criminal charges for structuring generally apply only to cash withdrawals or deposits , and there ’ s been no indication Trump paid in cash .
Will Trump ’ s apparent lie have any legal consequences for him ?
Speaking to reporters on Air Force One on April 5 , Trump said he didn ’ t know about Cohen ’ s $ 130,000 payment to Daniels . Now , Giuliani says Trump did know something about it .
“ He did know about the general arrangements , ” Giuliani , a former prosecutor , told Sean Hannity on Wednesday night .
Many people are calling Trump ’ s statement a flat-out lie , although Giuliani and White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders insisted that Trump became aware of details about the payments only about two weeks ago .
“ This was information that the president didn ’ t know at the time but eventually learned , ” Sanders told reporters on Thursday .
There are strong reasons to doubt that Trump was entirely unaware until mid-April that Cohen had paid off Daniels . On Feb. 27 , Cohen sought a restraining order against Daniels , saying she violated the “ hush money ” deal . On March 6 , Daniels sued Trump and Cohen in a bid to void the alleged agreement . It seems likely that those events would have triggered the president or his lawyers to inquire about when Daniels was paid , why and how much .
While it ’ s not a crime to lie to reporters or the public , legal experts say that if Trump knew the Cohen payments were the focus of a criminal investigation or Federal Election Commission review , deliberately trying to confuse investigators could form the basis for an obstruction-of-justice charge . Normally , however , prosecutors cite a public statement along with other facts showing what amounts to a deceptive scheme .
“ It is one factor , if you could build a series of misstatements , ” said Levenson , the Loyola law professor . “ You don ’ t want to put too much stock into any individual statements . You want to build a pattern of conduct . ”
Many lawyers said on Thursday that while Giuliani ’ s presentation might have been ham-fisted and at times counterproductive , he and Trump might have had little choice but to get out the fact that Trump was involved in reimbursing Cohen ’ s payment to Daniels .
In recent days , Cohen ’ s attorneys began receiving copies of the records seized from his office , home and hotel room early last month . If those records contained enough information to make clear that Trump did have a role in the payment , that fact was certain to emerge eventually . So there ’ s some rationale for Giuliani ’ s going on a friendly show like “ Hannity ” and offering up the unexpected news .
Even if the payment were purely personal , might Trump have broken another law ?
Taking Giuliani at his word that the money sent to Daniels had nothing to do with the campaign , Trump might still be guilty of another crime : filing a false personal financial disclosure report . Cohen ’ s decision to pay Daniels and then collect the money from Trump over time seems like a loan to Trump , but it was never reported on his financial statement filed with the Office of Government Ethics last year .
The watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington filed a complaint on the issue with the Justice Department back in March and updated it on Thursday with Giuliani ’ s statements .
“ Trying to talk his way out of a campaign finance violation , Trump has admitted to filing a false financial disclosure in 2017 , ” Walter Shaub , a former OGE director , wrote on Twitter .
Could linking Trump to the $ 130,000 payment bolster Daniels ’ two pending civil suits against him ?
Yes . At a minimum , Trump ’ s acknowledgment of involvement makes it far more likely that he ’ ll have to submit to a deposition on the topic , legal experts said .
“ I think at this point , he ’ s setting himself up to be subject to a deposition , ” Levenson said . “ I think it 's extremely beneficial to the civil cases . ”
One of Daniels ’ suits seeks to void the “ hush money ” deal and accuses Cohen of defamation . A case filed earlier this week accuses Trump of defamation . Responding to Giuliani ’ s initial comments , Trump took to Twitter on Thursday morning to call Daniels ’ claims “ false and extortionist accusations. ” That will likely result in a broader libel suit from Daniels against Trump , also adding Giuliani as a defendant , lawyers said , although it could be some time before either case progresses to a stage where Trump ’ s testimony is ordered .
“ Whatever happens @ foxandfriends , please do not stop helping our case week in and week out by having Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani appear and make damaging stmts , ” Daniels ’ attorney , Michael Avenatti , tweeted Thursday morning . “ You are truly THE BEST ; where can we send the gift basket ? ”","Some pundits are going so far as to call former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani’s actions the equivalent of a “murder-suicide."" | Drew Angerer/Getty Images How Giuliani's remarks on Trump and Stormy Daniels change the legal landscape Lawyers are divided on whether the former mayor put the president in greater jeopardy.

Schuetz","AUSTIN — Texas state Rep. Ron Reynolds was running for his fourth term when in early 2016 he abruptly stopped reporting his finances to the state . He didn ’ t file another report for about two years , keeping secret the amount of money he raised during that time and the identities of those who gave it to him .
Reynolds , D-Missouri City , is one of about a hundred candidates , lobbyists and political action committee treasurers each year who fail to file mandatory disclosures of their donors and expenses , racking up thousands of dollars in fines as a result , according to an analysis by Hearst Newspapers .
Yet candidates with unpaid fines can continue to run for office and the committees can go on operating , thanks to a weak enforcement system that allows them to dodge their responsibility to the state and voters . Reynolds still owes over $ 74,000 as he runs for re-election this year .
The Texas Attorney General ’ s Office , which handles collections for the Texas Ethics Commission , since 2005 has won the right in court to collect $ 1.1 million from late filers , including Reynolds , but the office has then written off $ 800,000 as uncollectible , effectively ending attempts to financially penalize candidates and political committees .
“ Campaign finance in Texas is basically a wild west , no rules system , ” said Anthony Gutierrez , executive director of Common Cause Texas , an advocacy group that seeks to reduce the influence of money in politics . “ Only in the most extreme circumstances do you see people being held accountable . ”
For subscribers : Gov . Abbott hauls in two $ 1M checks in Texas , land of unlimited political giving
It ’ s rare for office holders like Reynolds to allow their fines to pile up . Elected officials , including judges and legislators , make up a small portion of the total outstanding fines , the majority of which are owed by candidates who lost , lobbyists and PAC treasurers .
Still , the state ’ s lack of enforcement could give candidates and politicians with unpaid fines little motivation to pay up or account for their fundraising in 2020 , a competitive election that could tip the scales of power in Texas for years to come . The campaign finance reports are required by law because they reveal where candidates are getting their money in a state with few limits on contributions , which has meant some have received checks as high as $ 1 million from individual donors .
Reynolds , a personal injury attorney who has been in the Legislature since 2011 , has yet to file the missing campaign reports , Texas Ethics Commission records show . Meanwhile , the attorney general ’ s office has gone to court seven times trying to collect fines from Reynolds since 2008 .
Those court judgments are supposed to act as an incentive for a candidate to pay because they can inhibit a person ’ s ability to get a loan or lower their credit score , the attorney general ’ s office said .
Reynolds , however , said the lawsuits haven ’ t negatively impacted his credit score or affected his job as a state representative . Just one of the fines for $ 9,400 has been paid back in full ; Reynolds said he is making payments toward the rest of the debt , but he did not respond to a request that he provide proof of payment . The attorney general ’ s office did not respond to a request for confirmation . Reynolds has not missed reporting deadlines in the last year .
He said he plans to file the missing campaign finance reports next month , explaining that the fines accrued after he missed filing deadlines when his mother was in intensive care , when he was in the hospital and when he was out of the country .
In 2018 , Reynolds served nearly four months in jail for illegally soliciting clients for his law practice and was released in time for the beginning of the 2019 legislative session . He has been disbarred in Texas but is appealing the decision .
“ My constituents appreciate the fact that I 'm very engaged and responsive to their concerns , ” he said in a statement . “ I plan to stay focused on fighting for my constituents and not distracted by old fines that I 'm already in the process of paying off . ”
In 2018 , 22 percent of people fined actually paid up

Ron Reynolds was running for his fourth term when in early 2016 he abruptly stopped reporting his finances to the state. He didn’t file another report for about two years, keeping secret the amount of money he raised during that time and the identities of those who gave it to him.

Reynolds, D-Missouri City, is one of about a hundred candidates, lobbyists and political action committee treasurers each year who fail to file mandatory disclosures of their donors and expenses, racking up thousands of dollars in fines as a result, according to an analysis by Hearst Newspapers.

Yet candidates with unpaid fines can continue to run for office and the committees can go on operating, thanks to a weak enforcement system that allows them to dodge their responsibility to the state and voters. Reynolds still owes over $74,000 as he runs for re-election this year.

The Texas Attorney General’s Office, which handles collections for the Texas Ethics Commission, since 2005 has won the right in court to collect $1.1 million from late filers, including Reynolds, but the office has then written off $800,000 as uncollectible, effectively ending attempts to financially penalize candidates and political committees.

“Campaign finance in Texas is basically a wild west, no rules system,” said Anthony Gutierrez, executive director of Common Cause Texas, an advocacy group that seeks to reduce the influence of money in politics. “Only in the most extreme circumstances do you see people being held accountable.”

It’s rare for office holders like Reynolds to allow their fines to pile up. Elected officials, including judges and legislators, make up a small portion of the total outstanding fines, the majority of which are owed by candidates who lost, lobbyists and PAC treasurers.

Still, the state’s lack of enforcement could give candidates and politicians with unpaid fines little motivation to pay up or account for their fundraising in 2020, a competitive election that could tip the scales of power in Texas for years to come. The campaign finance reports are required by law because they reveal where candidates are getting their money in a state with few limits on contributions, which has meant some have received checks as high as $1 million from individual donors.

Reynolds, a personal injury attorney who has been in the Legislature since 2011, has yet to file the missing campaign reports, Texas Ethics Commission records show. Meanwhile, the attorney general’s office has gone to court seven times trying to collect fines from Reynolds since 2008.

Those court judgments are supposed to act as an incentive for a candidate to pay because they can inhibit a person’s ability to get a loan or lower their credit score, the attorney general’s office said.

Reynolds, however, said the lawsuits haven’t negatively impacted his credit score or affected his job as a state representative. Just one of the fines for $9,400 has been paid back in full; Reynolds said he is making payments toward the rest of the debt, but he did not respond to a request that he provide proof of payment. The attorney general’s office did not respond to a request for confirmation. Reynolds has not missed reporting deadlines in the last year.

He said he plans to file the missing campaign finance reports next month, explaining that the fines accrued after he missed filing deadlines when his mother was in intensive care, when he was in the hospital and when he was out of the country.

In 2018, Reynolds served nearly four months in jail for illegally soliciting clients for his law practice and was released in time for the beginning of the 2019 legislative session. He has been disbarred in Texas but is appealing the decision.

“My constituents appreciate the fact that I'm very engaged and responsive to their concerns,” he said in a statement. “I plan to stay focused on fighting for my constituents and not distracted by old fines that I'm already in the process of paying off.”

In 2018, 22 percent of people fined actually paid up

The attorney general’s office said it does all it can to collect the fines, by blocking elected officials from receiving reimbursements from the state or filing lawsuits when fees are hefty enough to justify the legal cost, before labeling them uncollectible. While those facing steep fines are cut off from state contracts and reimbursements, delinquent lawmakers can continue to collect their salaries and per diem checks.

Other states such as New York, California and Florida can garnish wages, levy tax liens or even send collections agencies after debtors, but Texas regulators have none of those options. State law provides the civil courts as the only remedy for collecting unpaid fines. Once the Texas Attorney General deems fines uncollectible, the debt stays on the books and could still be paid one day, but there are no enforcement options left for the agency to take, officials said.

Dozens of lobbyists, judges and lawmakers have paid off their debts, some of which reach tens of thousands of dollars. But plenty of other candidates and officials — representing all political parties — have not.

Of the cases closed in 2018, about 22 percent of candidates and officials paid their fines in full. The rest were either waived by the commission or otherwise uncollectible at least in part.

“I have complete confidence that the attorney general’s office takes all referrals made by the Texas Ethics Commission and other state agencies seriously and after evaluating each individually, pursues the course of action that it deems is in the best interest of the State of Texas,” Craycraft said.

Candidates have several opportunities to avoid a fine levied by the ethics commission. If they fail to report campaign spending on time, candidates can request the ethics commission waive the fine after they turn in the late report.

States with tougher laws have no problem collecting

State Board of Education Board Member Georgina Perez is one of the more than 300 people whose fines were dropped in the last decade. Perez said she had a technical issue with submitting her disclosure forms that was later resolved.

Perez said she was very concerned about having a fine on her record and dealt with the issue immediately, but even if she hadn’t, the hold on her reimbursements for board-related travel and other expenses likely would have been “highly effective” — especially since she has to make the 1,100-mile round trip drive from El Paso to Austin many times a year for board meetings.

“They would have gotten that $11,000,” she said.

In Florida, the state can recover unpaid fines through salary withholding, wage garnishment or referral to a collection agency, though the ethics commission’s deputy executive director Kerrie Stillman said it has not been forced to garnish wages yet. Most cases are resolved before then, though, and the state has a 99 percent compliance rate, according to its 2018 report.

Similarly, the vast majority of cases in California are settled through its Fair Political Practices Commission. Respondents can contest a finding of a violation before an administrative law judge.

In about a half-dozen cases per year in the state, the respondent either fails to come to a settlement or evades the commission. At that point, the commission can vote to send the unpaid fines to a division focused on collections. By law, that division can levy a property tax lien or garnish tax refunds from the Franchise Tax Board and Internal Revenue Service.

“The Political Reform Act and FPPC have been in existence for 46 years,” said spokesman Jay Wierenga about his state’s high level of compliance. “So the political community at large is pretty well-aware of the requirements and laws and regulations.”

The majority of cases in New York are also resolved by settlement. A spokesman for the New York State Joint Commission on Public Ethics, Walter McClure, said only a couple cases have been sent to the attorney general in recent years.

Asked whether there is more the Texas Ethics Commission could do, administratively or through a legislative change, to collect overdue fines, Craycraft, the commission’s chair, declined to comment, saying only that it is “not a policy-making agency.”

That makes it unlikely the commission, which Gutierrez described as one of the most toothless Texas agencies, will see change.

Elizabeth Warren announced that she will continue to reject big donors and corporate funding throughout the 2020 general election , if she ’ s the Democratic nominee , and challenged her opponents to disclose their big donors as well .
“ If Democratic candidates for President want to spend their time hobnobbing with the rich and powerful , it currently legal for them to do so , ” Warren wrote . “ But they shouldn ’ t be handing out secret titles and honors to rich donors . ”
It was a shot across the bow at opponents like former Vice President Joe Biden , Sen. Kamala Harris , and South Bend , Ind . Mayor Pete Buttigieg , who continue to accept money from big donors and hold the closed-door fundraisers that had been the hallmark of almost every major campaign until the Sanders 2016 presidential run .
Warren ’ s new plan was released just a day after Buttigieg drew blowback from online progressives for comments about his fundraising strategy . “ My competitors can go with whatever strategy they like , but we ’ re going to make sure that we have the resources to compete because we we are going up against the sitting President of the United States , ” Buttigieg told Snapchat ’ s Peter Hamby . “ He has tremendous amounts of support and allies at his back , and we ’ re not going to beat him with pocket change . ”

Progressives online slammed him immediately . “ Small-dollar grassroots campaigns , aka what Buttigieg insults here as ‘ pocket change , ’ out-fundraise him by millions , ” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez tweeted in responses . “ Our nation ’ s leaders should be working to end the era of big money politics , not protect it . ”
But Warren has so far raised an impressive haul despite rejecting big-money donations . The campaign announced in October that they ’ d raised $ 24.6 million in the third quarter from 943,000 donations , including roughly a third who donated to the campaign for the first time ( the average grassroots donation was $ 26 , the campaign said . ) Senator Bernie Sanders , who also refuses corporate donations , raised even more that quarter : $ 25.3 million from 1.4 million contributions .

The issue of campaign finance will likely come front and center at Tuesday night ’ s debate , as Warren enters the debate stage after month of rising in the polls .","In a new campaign finance plan released Tuesday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren announced that she will continue to reject big donors and corporate funding throughout the 2020 general election, if she’s the Democratic nominee, and challenged her opponents to disclose their big donors as well.

“If Democratic candidates for President want to spend their time hobnobbing with the rich and powerful, it currently legal for them to do so,” Warren wrote. “But they shouldn’t be handing out secret titles and honors to rich donors.”

It was a shot across the bow at opponents like former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Kamala Harris, and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who continue to accept money from big donors and hold the closed-door fundraisers that had been the hallmark of almost every major campaign until the Sanders 2016 presidential run.

Warren’s new plan was released just a day after Buttigieg drew blowback from online progressives for comments about his fundraising strategy. “My competitors can go with whatever strategy they like, but we’re going to make sure that we have the resources to compete because we we are going up against the sitting President of the United States,” Buttigieg told Snapchat’s Peter Hamby. “He has tremendous amounts of support and allies at his back, and we’re not going to beat him with pocket change.”

Progressives online slammed him immediately. “Small-dollar grassroots campaigns, aka what Buttigieg insults here as ‘pocket change,’ out-fundraise him by millions,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez tweeted in responses. “Our nation’s leaders should be working to end the era of big money politics, not protect it.”

But Warren has so far raised an impressive haul despite rejecting big-money donations. The campaign announced in October that they’d raised $24.6 million in the third quarter from 943,000 donations, including roughly a third who donated to the campaign for the first time (the average grassroots donation was $26, the campaign said.) Senator Bernie Sanders, who also refuses corporate donations, raised even more that quarter: $25.3 million from 1.4 million contributions. And big donors doesn’t necessarily translate into top fundraisng numbers. Buttigieg raised $19.1 million last quarter, falling short of his Q2 haul. Biden raised $15.2 million, and Harris raised $11.6 million.

In addition to vowing to reject donations over $200 from executives at big tech companies, banks, private equity firms and hedge funds, Warren’s new plan would aim to make it illegal for federal candidates to accept corporate PAC money, close the loophole that allow foreign corporations to influence U.S. politics, ban lobbyist bundling and forbid the selection of ambassadors based on campaign donations.

The issue of campaign finance will likely come front and center at Tuesday night’s debate, as Warren enters the debate stage after month of rising in the polls.

Jeb Bush’s presidential campaign, which to date has raised significantly more than his Republican rivals’, is encountering difficulties maintaining its torrid pace as Mr. Bush slips in the polls and top party donors continue to withhold their commitments.

A finance aide for Mr. Bush sent an email to contributors Friday with an invitation to a breakfast fund-raiser in Washington next month, with a pointed plea that the former Florida governor’s supporters find new donors.

“Please note — this is new money only,” wrote Sarah Corsaro, the staff member, using bold for emphasis. She said, “We are utilizing this event to drive in new funds” for the next quarterly fund-raising disclosure.

The co-chair committee for the $1,000-per-person breakfast indicates why Mr. Bush is so focused on finding new donors: It is a list heavy with family, friends, and former aides and loyalists to his father, brother and himself.

Mr. Bush raised a combined $114 million for his campaign and “super PAC” in the first half of the year, but with Donald J. Trump unexpectedly surging and Mr. Bush falling in Republican polls, some of the party’s top money raisers are remaining on the fence in terms of supporting Mr. Bush.

This reluctance, and the prospect of a hard-fought Republican contest that could last well into 2016, has prompted Mr. Bush to institute cost-saving measures in his campaign. Some aides have seen their pay cut back as part of an effort to curtail spending.

NERMEEN SHAIKH : In one of the first closely watched primaries of the 2014 election season , the speaker of the North Carolina House , Thom Tillis , has won the Republican U.S. Senate nomination . He will now face Democratic Senator Kay Hagan in November in a race that could decide which party controls the Senate . The Republican primary drew national attention as it pitted Tillis , who was backed by much of the Republican establishment , against candidates with close ties to the tea party and the religious right . Some analysts described the primary as a proxy war in the battle for the soul of the Republican Party . Tillis had received endorsements from big-name Republicans , including Mitt Romney , Jeb Bush and Karl Rove , as well as the National Rifle Association . One of his challengers , tea party favorite Greg Brannon , was backed by Senator Rand Paul , while another challenger , Mark Harris , a Baptist minister , drew support from Mike Huckabee . In the end , Tillis received 45 percent of the vote , enough to prevent a runoff . As speaker of the North Carolina House , Tillis was a frequent target of the Moral Monday protests over the past two years .
AMY GOODMAN : Primaries were also held Tuesday in North Carolina to determine who will sit on the state Supreme Court . The races have gained national attention because millions of dollars from outside groups have poured into the state to back conservative candidates . North Carolina is one of 22 states where judges on higher courts are elected rather than appointed .
To talk more about North Carolina , we ’ re joined by Chris Kromm in Raleigh . He is executive director of the Institute for Southern Studies .
Let ’ s go first to the Thom Tillis race . Talk about the significance of what happened there . It is being seen as a bellwether for the Republican Party all over the country , Chris .
CHRIS KROMM : Well , North Carolina is a bellwether state , and this race , I think , just drove that home . Two of the big storylines for me are , one , this escalating arms race of big money that ’ s increasingly deciding , including primary elections—we saw about $ 2 million coming in from outside groups that really wanted to back Thom Tillis as the establishment candidate for this Republican primary in an effort to topple Kay Hagan , the sitting Democrat , and eventually , like you said , win control of the U.S. Senate . So , Tillis was aiming for this 40 percent number . That ’ s how much he had to get to avoid a runoff .
But it also pointed to another big storyline , which is the civil war that Republicans are facing with the tea party . And going into this race , it wasn ’ t at all clear that Tillis , even with this establishment backing , really could pull it off . And in the end , he did . He got 45 percent . But it does raise the question , if those kind of right-wing challengers had coalesced around one candidate , maybe we would be seeing a costly runoff .
But just because Tillis is the establishment candidate , of course , doesn ’ t mean that he is a moderate candidate . He has also called himself the leader of the conservative revolution in North Carolina , which is why he was a target of the Moral Monday protests . And he ’ s on record—you ’ ve talked a lot in this show about climate change . Well , in a recent debate , he was asked flatly if he believed in the science of climate change , if that was a fact , and he said no . But that ’ s an example of , I think , how the overall debate has shifted to the right . He doesn ’ t agree in a minimum wage . He thinks that ’ s an artificial standard that ’ s being put on business . He promoted the anti-gay-marriage amendment in North Carolina . Kind of a series of positions that really puts him in the rightward camp . So even though he had a tea party challenge , it shows how much the political debate has shifted to the right in North Carolina .
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Could you talk about—Chris , you mentioned the amount of outside money in this primary election race . Could you talk about who some of his backers , Thom Tillis ’ s backers , were in this election ?
CHRIS KROMM : We saw two big players coming into the primary . One , nationally , was Americans for Prosperity . They have spent more money—this is the Koch brothers ’ tea party group . They have spent more money attacking Kay Hagan than any other candidate across the country . And that started last fall . I mean , they ’ ve just been blanketing , a carpet bombing of the state of these attack ads , kind of trying to soften up support for Kay Hagan . Then , on the other side , you saw millions of dollars ’ worth of ads supporting Tillis to really make sure he could survive this primary challenge from the tea party right . And again , there was about $ 1.6 million that came from Karl Rove ’ s group , American Crossroads . Last year they had set up this initiative called the Conservative Victory Fund , the whole idea being that they ’ d try to get the most electable candidates to face off in these general elections . So they wanted to make sure very early that you got somebody like Tillis , who is considered the more establishment candidate , who is going to survive the primary and come out in the end . And that outside money , I think , in the end—you saw how close that vote was in the primary—I think you can really say that outside money played a big role .
AMY GOODMAN : I want to turn to comments of North Carolina House Speaker Thom Tillis in 2011 about residents on public assistance .
SPEAKER THOM TILLIS : What we have to do is find a way to divide and conquer the people who are on assistance . We have to show respect for that woman who has cerebral palsy and had no choice in her condition , that needs help and that we should help . And we need to get those folks to look down at these people who choose to get into a condition that makes them dependent on the government , and say , at some point , “ You are on your own . We may end up taking care of those babies , but we ’ re not going to take care of you. ” And we ’ ve got to start having that serious discussion . It won ’ t happen next year—wrong time , because it ’ s going to be politically charged . One of the reasons why I may never run for another elected office is because some of these things may just get me railroaded out of town .
AMY GOODMAN : That was Thom Tillis in 2011 , the North Carolina House speaker . And let ’ s go back to that clip from the North Carolina Republican Senate debate you just mentioned , when all the Republican candidates vying for their party ’ s nomination said climate change was not a fact .
AMY GOODMAN : So there you have it on both of these issues . Chris Kromm , if you could address both ? And talk about the ads , which were very clear in talking about Thom Tillis as center-right .
CHRIS KROMM : Well , and that ’ s the thing , is it ’ s really been a difficulty trying to position Tillis , given that he had to run somewhat moderate , distinguish himself from the tea party challengers , but also had to be conservative to try to win over some of that support and also own up to his record . That clip about public assistance became somewhat infamous . I mean , rarely does a politician openly embrace a strategy where they say , “ We need to divide and conquer. ” Usually they don ’ t claim that kind of strategy , kind of harkens back to the Southern strategy that Richard Nixon mapped out for the South , you know , 40 , 50 years ago .
You know , it really shows an attitude towards the public sector . Another place where that ’ s been reflected is in public schools . Here , North Carolina had always been considered a leader nationally with its public schools , and been a steady dismantling under Tillis ’ s leadership , cutting teacher pay , proposing the expansion of charter schools , vouchers for private schools . And so , it ’ s kind of this view that you would more associate with a tea party perspective about that the government can do no good .
And on climate change , you ’ ll notice they didn ’ t even say human-caused climate change ; it was whether or not climate change at all is considered a fact . And he said no to that . And this comes out at the very same time , as your first guest pointed out , we have this National Climate Assessment , which showed that the Southeast is going to be one of the most intensely affected regions . The Mid-Atlantic is going to be a hotspot for sea-level rise , and here you have a candidate , who ’ s establishment Republican candidate , denying that the very existence of climate change is a phenomenon .
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Chris Kromm , I also want to ask you about the judicial races in North Carolina . This is a TV ad that ran regularly in the lead-up to yesterday ’ s primary .
JUSTICE FOR ALL NC AD : We want judges to protect us . When child molesters sued to stop electronic monitoring of their locations , a law that let us track child molesters near schools , playgrounds , daycare centers , Supreme Court Justice Robin Hudson sided with the predators . Hudson cited a child molester ’ s right to privacy and took the side of the convicted molesters . Justice Robin Hudson , not tough on child molesters , not fair to victims .
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Chris Kromm , could you talk about the group behind this ad , who ’ s funding them , and also about the fact that judges are being elected in North Carolina , because that ’ s perhaps not something that most—a lot of people are familiar with , that judges are also elected ?
CHRIS KROMM : Well , this is becoming one of the key battlegrounds for elections . We do have judicial elections in North Carolina , and this year is going to be one of the biggest . Four Supreme Court races are up , seven total on—statewide , with the court of appeals , as well . And this has become a big money magnet for these outside groups , because they have a very big interest , including groups that are backed by corporations that often have business before the Supreme Court .
The group that ran that particular ad , which has been widely denounced and condemned—even some conservative commentators have said it ’ s one of the most despicable ads they ’ ve seen , that it ’ s based on lies , roundly condemned—was run by this super PAC called Justice for All NC . It doesn ’ t really exist as an organization . It hasn ’ t filed anywhere as a corporate entity . We went to go visit its office , and it turned out to be a UPS mailbox in a Raleigh strip mall . What it mostly is a funnel for money , and it ’ s gotten $ 900,000 this year from the Republican State Leadership Committee , the Washington , D.C. , super PAC , which has taken a special interest in trying to get conservative justices elected in states like North Carolina . They were a big funder in 2012 , helping elect a guy called Paul Newby , who is running for re-election . They had over $ 2 million worth of ads running for him this year .
We saw in the primary an attempt to unseat a sitting justice . These are nonpartisan races , but she ’ s a sitting—a registered Democrat , Robin Hudson—big money trying to unseat her and primary her out . She survived that challenge , and I think , in part , it was because these ads were so nasty that there was a bit of a backfire , backlash , against big money trying to call this race .
AMY GOODMAN : And what do you think this means for November , the big race between Kay Hagan and Thom Tillis ?
CHRIS KROMM : Well , I think between that U.S. Senate race , you ’ ve got these Supreme Court races , state Supreme Court races—you ’ re going to see all records shattered in terms of the amount of big money coming into the state , a lot of it from these national super PACs , some of them with donors that you can ’ t even trace . Increasingly , this is going to be the money magnet . And that really points to the fact that North Carolina is this key battleground state . You have Moral Monday , you have the rightward turn , and big money sees it as critical that they spend to try to shape the political outcome and direction of the state .

She was the breakout star in CNN's Republican debate on Wednesday, the second straight contest in which she's distinguished herself. She's the former CEO of a major company and she's well-connected in donor-rich California.

But she has a problem: The money hasn't followed the hype -- yet.

Many top Clinton supporters say it ’ s now time for the other powerhouse Clinton — Bill — to employ his own magic touch to rescue Priorities USA Action and , in the process , shove reluctant liberal donors into the big-money game Republicans are easily winning .
“ I think President Clinton continues to be a great draw and an effective fundraiser and should be deployed in that capacity , ” one Democratic donor close to the Clintons told ███ , echoing the near-universal sentiment of a dozen fundraisers interviewed for this article . “ Many of us have known him since the 1980s and worked with him since then , so he has a tremendous reservoir of friendship and goodwill across the country to draw from . ”
One problem with that : The former president , who raised tens of millions for his charitable foundation , has sat out the 2016 cash race so far and has told his friends and political allies he has no plans to help out the struggling group until the fall “ at the earliest , ” according to a senior Democrat close to Clinton .
Priorities , which has recently been taken over by a former top official from Clinton ’ s 2008 race , told allies that it had raised just $ 15.6 million in the first quarter , which will be dwarfed by the expected $ 100 million brought in by Right to Rise , Jeb Bush ’ s super PAC . That ’ s making Clinton insiders nervous about whether Priorities will have enough cash to fight back against Republican independent expenditure groups that seem to collect campaign money from a spigot .
“ It ’ s a dilemma and a challenge , ” said a veteran Democratic fundraiser with connections to Priorities . “ Outside of Hillary herself , the president ’ s the biggest draw , and he ’ s the biggest draw with some of the bigger donors … [ The Clintons ] have made the decision that it ’ s too soon to get him involved . It ’ s their judgment that Priorities can wait . I ’ m not sure Priorities can wait , but that ’ s their judgment . ”
Democrats have lagged badly in the no-limits , Koch Brothers-ruled world of electoral fundraising created by the Supreme Court ’ s 2010 Citizens United decision . Unlike conservatives , most wealthy liberals support stringent campaign finance laws , and most Democrats with bank accounts fat enough to write seven-figure checks are loath to do so — at least until the tail end of an election cycle .
The Clintons , less hostile to the notion of super PACs than the clean-hands team around President Barack Obama , were supposed to interrupt this self-defeating cycle . One top Democratic fundraiser was so convinced the 42nd president was the answer to the party ’ s squeamishness about big money that he recently labeled Clinton , in a burst of optimism , “ the $ 200 Million Man . ”
But Bill Clinton has been nowhere on the money scene — either for Hillary ’ s official campaign , or on the super PAC side .
Hillary has focused almost entirely on collecting $ 2,700 checks for her primary face-off against … Bernie Sanders . And Bill has made it clear to friends and contributors that while he ’ s supportive and might work for the group down the road , for now he ’ s too busy with his foundation work . His wife ’ s team , meanwhile , has been all too happy to keep the Big Dog on a leash , at least at this early stage of the campaign .
The upshot is that Priorities — rocked by a recent reshuffling that saw Clinton ally Guy Cecil replace a longtime Obama operative — trails its GOP counterparts badly in fundraising .
Republican candidates and their billionaire backers certainly won ’ t adhere to the Clintons ’ leisurely super PAC timetable , dissenters from the current strategy point out . Priorities ’ newly revamped leadership needs the couple to move faster if they are to counter the flood of positive ads Right to Rise is expected to run in battleground states , where Bush is looking to lower his negative ratings among skeptical voters .
Priorities , meanwhile , is still just getting organized . Board members are only now starting to casually pitch donors before the group puts together the kind of rigorous , analytical presentation that was key to its fundraising efforts in 2012 . As a result , many potential Democratic donors are idling in neutral as Cecil ’ s team gets its bearings , sitting on their cash while the Republicans rack up nine-figure numbers . That $ 15.6 million total would have been many times larger had the Clintons made funding the group a top priority , people familiar with Priorities ’ fundraising efforts say .
“ Bill or Hillary makes a call to [ Democratic donors like ] Haim Saban or Susie Tompkins Buell and we get $ 30 million in a weekend , ” said a Democratic operative close to Priorities .
The disappointing start has already caused Priorities to lower its overall goals for the 2016 cycle . The group had hoped to raise $ 300 million just to keep pace , but insiders now expect the total haul to be in the $ 150-million to $ 200-million range . Even so , Cecil will have to lean hard on his close relationship with the Clintons to lure strong Hillary supporters who haven ’ t given to Priorities in the past — while selling the former first family on the importance of selling their friends on Priorities .
That will be a challenge . GOP donors like the Kochs and Sheldon Adelson are far more willing to throw vast amounts at their favored candidates ; Democratic donors , even the wealthiest ones , are more likely to fund an issue-advocacy campaign than to write a $ 1 million check to a group largely know for cutting negative ads .
“ I think fundraising for Democrats is always slower and we ’ re always going to be outspent … There is just no way any of us can keep up with the Koch brothers , ” said Amber Mostyn , who , along with her husband , gave $ 3 million to Priorities in 2012 when it raised about $ 80 million for Obama ’ s reelection effort .
The Mostyns have had a few conversations with Paul Begala , who raises cash for the group , and Priorities chairwoman former Michigan Gov . Jennifer Granholm after David Brock , a close Clinton ally , resigned from the board following a critical New York Times story about the fundraising practices of other Brock-linked groups . Mostyn said they plan to give again , but they just don ’ t feel the urgency to give yet — in part because Clinton ’ s path to the nomination looks relatively unobstructed , Sanders notwithstanding .
Andy Spahn , a California-based Democratic fundraiser with close ties to the Clintons , thinks Bill Clinton ’ s involvement could goad donors like the Mostyns to move more quickly . Under federal law , both Clintons are technically “ agents ” of the 2016 campaign , and therefore barred from soliciting super PAC contributions in excess of $ 5,000 . But there are few constraints preventing either from headlining events for Priorities , touting the group ’ s effectiveness or romancing donors in person and over the phone .
Bill Clinton ’ s personal charisma could be especially crucial : As important as operatives like Begala and John Podesta are for wooing donors , the former president is expected to be the closer in small group settings , even if it he can ’ t overtly embrace that role for fear of violating the law . He also can draw from his foundation network — donors that are used to cutting multimillion-dollar checks .
The one Priorities donor meeting in the Bay Area Hillary Clinton attended , held in early May , illustrated the awkwardness of the Clinton super PAC pitch : She opened her remarks with a hold-your-nose pose , acknowledging that she would prefer not to raise money for her own super PAC and saying , “ It ’ s a sad reality , but we have to play by the rules. ” Then she took questions , mostly about policy , and made no other direct pitch other than speaking kindly about the group in general terms , according to a person in attendance . Bush , by contrast , in April hosted a lavish , two-day retreat for more than 300 of his top benefactors at a posh Miami hotel , where he told them they were making history .
Hillary Clinton has , however , moved aggressively to raise money for her own campaign . So far , she ’ s focused on raising relatively small amounts of hard money — $ 2,700 a pop , or $ 27,000 in a bundle — for the primary , but she will soon shift into a second phase of big-money donor bundling coupled with a ramped-up online fundraising operation modeled after Obama ’ s . That leaves Bill Clinton , along with daughter , Chelsea , and Podesta , as the most likely regular surrogates for Priorities .
That ’ s why one of Cecil ’ s main objectives over the next few months is to sell the former president — and his friend Tina Flournoy , Bill Clinton ’ s chief of staff — on giving potential super PAC donors the kind of face-time he ’ s given to foundation and campaign donors . “ Guy has to acclimate him to the idea that the super PAC is as important as anything else , ” said a longtime Clinton associate .

But Bill Clinton has his reasons for remaining on the bench , at least through the end of the year . His first priority , friends say , is raising enough cash to endow his foundation , and burnishing its reputation in the wake of stories revealing the tapping of foreign donors with pending State Department business and other questionable practices . Clinton ’ s recent schedule has been notably packed with foundation events : After barnstorming for Democrats in 2014 , his only 2015 political fundraiser was a February appearance on behalf of Alvin Brown , who made a failed bid to be the mayor of Jacksonville , Florida .
Hillary Clinton ’ s political team in Brooklyn has its own motives for keeping the former president on the sidelines for a while . In part , it ’ s to manage its least manageable surrogate ; in part , it ’ s because securing multi-million dollar donations undercuts the campaign ’ s narrative of raising small amounts from “ everyday American ” donors instead of Wall Street zillionaires .
This is a campaign that avidly pushes tales about staffers so cheap they ’ ll ride the BoltBus between Washington and Brooklyn . They are none too eager to read stories about Bill Clinton “ wining and dining somebody for a million-dollar check … that will give Bernie Sanders a big thrill , ” according to one aide — especially after repeated accounts of Bill Clinton ’ s aggressive fundraising on behalf of his foundation .
But to some extent , Priorities ’ struggles simply reflect the Democratic Party ’ s chronic unease in the unlimited-money environment . Some big Clinton donors are reluctant to give on ideological grounds because they abhor super PACs and the massive amounts of money they inject into the political system . And heavyweights like Saban , Fred Eychaner and James Simons haven ’ t stepped forward to write the kind of $ 5 million-plus contributions that would make an immediate difference — though billionaire financier George Soros has come forward to bankroll other Clinton-linked super PAC efforts .
It might take a crisis to wake donors — and perhaps the Clintons — out of their super PAC stupor . Priorities struggled to raise money for Obama in 2012 until he whiffed the first debate against Mitt Romney . Money poured in once Democratic donors believed his reelection was no longer inevitable , according to multiple sources close to the Priorities .
Several donors interviewed by ███ suggested that Cecil and the new regime are hoping Priorities ’ relatively small haul , which will be officially reported later this month , will serve as a wake-up call ; Democratic donors will be stunned to see how much cash Right to Rise raised by comparison and race to open their wallets . Potential contributors contacted by Priorities staff and board members in recent days told ███ they felt little pressure to write checks before the filing deadline , perhaps to underscore the organization ’ s cash crisis .
“ I think on some level we may suffer from the unintended consequences of Hillary being such a strong candidate , ” Amber Mostyn said .","A fundraising-obsessed Hillary Clinton netted an impressive $45 million during the first three months of her campaign — but her badly outgunned super PAC’s failure to keep pace is damping any celebration of the feat.

They are none too eager to read stories about Bill Clinton “wining and dining somebody for a million-dollar check … that will give Bernie Sanders a big thrill,” according to one aide — especially after repeated accounts of Bill Clinton’s aggressive fundraising on behalf of his foundation.

But to some extent, Priorities’ struggles simply reflect the Democratic Party’s chronic unease in the unlimited-money environment. Some big Clinton donors are reluctant to give on ideological grounds because they abhor super PACs and the massive amounts of money they inject into the political system. And heavyweights like Saban, Fred Eychaner and James Simons haven’t stepped forward to write the kind of $5 million-plus contributions that would make an immediate difference — though billionaire financier George Soros has come forward to bankroll other Clinton-linked super PAC efforts.

It might take a crisis to wake donors — and perhaps the Clintons — out of their super PAC stupor. Priorities struggled to raise money for Obama in 2012 until he whiffed the first debate against Mitt Romney. Money poured in once Democratic donors believed his reelection was no longer inevitable, according to multiple sources close to the Priorities.

Several donors interviewed by POLITICO suggested that Cecil and the new regime are hoping Priorities’ relatively small haul, which will be officially reported later this month, will serve as a wake-up call; Democratic donors will be stunned to see how much cash Right to Rise raised by comparison and race to open their wallets. Potential contributors contacted by Priorities staff and board members in recent days told POLITICO they felt little pressure to write checks before the filing deadline, perhaps to underscore the organization’s cash crisis.

The big picture: Huge out-of-the-gate dollar advantages for Hillary Clinton in 2008 or Jeb Bush in 2016 didn't help them over the finish line.

David Koch was the Libertarian Party candidate for vice president in 1980!

The bottom line: In many ways, the money primary is not important because money is important, but rather because it helps determine which candidates are taken seriously by the media.

A bare minimum of money is necessary to staff a campaign, keep it on the road, and keep its vital functions on track — although Trump might have effectively disproved even that. Beyond that bare minimum, money tends to go in two directions: consultants and TV ads.

Candidates still spend the lion's share of their funds on TV ads, because that's where the boomers are, and boomers are very likely to vote. But TV ads are hard to target effectively, and they always come at a premium: Many swing-state local TV stations are happy to lose money three years in a row, just because they know that presidential election campaigns will be like money from helicopters.

campaign_finance,Politico,0,http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/gop-donors-donald-trump-224218,Furious GOP donors stew over Trump,2016-06-11,"Alex Isenstadt, Kristen East, Ali Breland","PARK CITY , Utah — Donald Trump is trying to win over a skeptical Republican donor class , but they ’ ve closed their wallets — and they ’ re angry .
On Friday afternoon , at an exclusive Republican donor retreat here hosted by Mitt Romney , frustration boiled over . During an off-the-record question-and-answer session with House Speaker Paul Ryan , Meg Whitman , the billionaire Hewlett Packard chief executive officer , confronted the speaker over his endorsement of Trump . Whitman , a major GOP giver who ran for California governor in 2010 , compared Trump to historical demagogues like Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini and wanted to know how the speaker could get behind him .
At another discussion session during the day , which featured top Romney alumni Stuart Stevens and Matt Rhoades , Ana Navarro , a Republican contributor and ubiquitous cable news personality , called Trump a “ racist ” and a “ vulgarian and a pig who has made disgusting comments about women for years. ” ( Neither Whitman nor Navarro would comment . )
Even Ryan , who has endorsed Trump despite criticizing his behavior , joked during his presentation on Friday that in a recent conversation with magician David Copperfield , he said that he wished he could make himself disappear .
The incidents , which were relayed by three sources who were present — one of whom described them as “ shocking ” — illustrates the intense anger coursing through the GOP donor community . Far from letting go of their white-knuckled opposition to Trump , they ’ re stewing in it .
“ I ’ ve been on the record with a statement saying I ’ m not supporting Donald Trump , and that hasn ’ t changed in four months , ” said Whitman , who helped bankroll TV ads against Trump during the Republican primary . She wouldn ’ t reveal which candidate she ’ d back in November , and said she didn ’ t intend to make a decision until later on .
“ Right now , I ’ m undecided , and undecided means I ’ m not doing anything , ” said John Rakolta , a Michigan construction company executive who was a top Romney fundraiser . “ I haven ’ t seen that ‘ pivot ’ that we ’ d need to see from someone who ’ s capable of being the next president of the United States . ”
The annual Experts and Enthusiasts summit , which brings together Romney ’ s expansive network of deep-pocketed contributors , served as a powerful reminder of the high hurdles Trump faces in courting the Republican money crowd . This week , Trump slashed his original fundraising expectations , saying he no longer believed he needed to raise $ 1 billion . Some of his top fundraisers think he ’ ll struggle to top $ 300 million , a figure that ’ s less than a third of what Romney raised in 2012 and a small fraction of what Hillary Clinton is expected to bring in .
Some are convinced the situation is growing increasingly bleak . In an interview here , Spencer Zwick , Romney ’ s former finance chair and one of the most prominent fundraisers in Republican politics , said that some of Romney ’ s donors would stay on the sidelines — and that others would even give to his Democratic opponent .
“ I ’ m sure you ’ ll see some that end up supporting Secretary Clinton , ” he said .
The interest in Clinton , however peripheral , was on display this week . On Friday , Republican pollster Frank Luntz stood before the approximately 250 attendees and asked them who they planned to vote for . Trump got the most claps , but Clinton got a few as well , said two people who were in the room . One person clapped loudly for Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson .
Even among those who say they ’ ll support Trump , though , there ’ s little appetite to give . Frank VanderSloot , an Idaho billionaire who oversees a nutritional supplement company , said he was behind Trump but hasn ’ t donated because the New York businessman has so far succeeded in running a low-budget campaign that ’ s centered on free media attention .
Many here are shifting their attention to down-ballot races . Zwick , who was courted by a number of 2016 GOP contenders and met with Trump , has been tapped to run Ryan ’ s finance operation . Rakolta said he ’ d also become heavily involved in the battle to protect the House majority and recently hosted a fundraiser to benefit Ryan . VanderSloot , meanwhile , said he planned to meet with Romney over the weekend to discuss Senate races .
“ We are doing everything we can to put our money in the right places and to save the Senate , ” VanderSloot said .
And while they may be reluctant to admit it , some are starting to think about the next presidential election — in 2020 . Among those making the trek to Utah this week were Ryan , Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton , Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse , and Wisconsin Gov . Scott Walker — all of whom were seen here as potential future White House contenders . All were mobbed .
There are even some who are still holding out hope that Romney , who has been scalding in his criticism of Trump , will reconsider his decision to stay out of the 2016 campaign and find some way to become a candidate . Over the course of the week , a number of supporters approached the 2012 nominee to ask him to enter the fray . His typical response , according to those who witnessed the exchanges : There ’ s no path for me .
Yet Romney , like many of those present , didn ’ t hold back in his criticism of his party ’ s presumptive nominee . On Saturday morning , during a question-and-answer session before the group that was moderated by CNN ’ s Wolf Blitzer , Romney defended his decision to speak out against Trump . In explaining why he ’ d decided to come out so forcefully against the party ’ s presumptive nominee — and at a time when many GOP leaders are urging unity — Romney appeared to tear up . He was convinced , he said , that Trump just couldn ’ t go unanswered .
Behind the scenes , Trump ’ s team — concerned that Romney ’ s attacks are hampering the mogul ’ s efforts to make inroads in the donor community — has been looking to ease tensions with the former Massachusetts governor . On Friday afternoon , after Romney told CNN that a Trump presidency could result in “ trickle-down racism , ” RNC Chairman Reince Priebus took to Twitter to say he “ couldn ’ t disagree more , ” and that it was “ time to stop this and unify. ” But before he published the tweet , according to two sources familiar with the back-and-forth , Priebus ’ s team gave Romney a conciliatory head ’ s up . On Friday evening , Priebus and Romney were seen having a private conversation at a patio reception outside the luxurious Stein Eriksen ski lodge , where the summit was being held . ( Spokespersons for Priebus and Romney declined to comment . )
Priebus and Anthony Scaramucci , a Wall Street investor who is helping Trump , spent hours at the lodge huddling with Romney ’ s allies .
Trump ’ s fundraisers , who acknowledge the challenge they face , are also taking steps to expand their candidate ’ s limited donor network . One said the campaign was working to establish a multi-city bundler program that , it hoped , could raise as much as $ 300 million .
Still , many are struggling to see a clear path forward . Zwick noted that Trump is far behind where Romney was in the donor chase at this point four years ago . One option , he said , is for Trump to accept public financing .

On Friday afternoon, at an exclusive Republican donor retreat here hosted by Mitt Romney, frustration boiled over. During an off-the-record question-and-answer session with House Speaker Paul Ryan, Meg Whitman, the billionaire Hewlett Packard chief executive officer, confronted the speaker over his endorsement of Trump. Whitman, a major GOP giver who ran for California governor in 2010, compared Trump to historical demagogues like Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini and wanted to know how the speaker could get behind him.

At another discussion session during the day, which featured top Romney alumni Stuart Stevens and Matt Rhoades, Ana Navarro, a Republican contributor and ubiquitous cable news personality, called Trump a “racist” and a “vulgarian and a pig who has made disgusting comments about women for years.” (Neither Whitman nor Navarro would comment.)

Even Ryan, who has endorsed Trump despite criticizing his behavior, joked during his presentation on Friday that in a recent conversation with magician David Copperfield, he said that he wished he could make himself disappear.

The incidents, which were relayed by three sources who were present — one of whom described them as “shocking” — illustrates the intense anger coursing through the GOP donor community. Far from letting go of their white-knuckled opposition to Trump, they’re stewing in it.

“I’ve been on the record with a statement saying I’m not supporting Donald Trump, and that hasn’t changed in four months,” said Whitman, who helped bankroll TV ads against Trump during the Republican primary. She wouldn’t reveal which candidate she’d back in November, and said she didn’t intend to make a decision until later on.

“Right now, I’m undecided, and undecided means I’m not doing anything,” said John Rakolta, a Michigan construction company executive who was a top Romney fundraiser. “I haven’t seen that ‘pivot’ that we’d need to see from someone who’s capable of being the next president of the United States.”

The annual Experts and Enthusiasts summit, which brings together Romney’s expansive network of deep-pocketed contributors, served as a powerful reminder of the high hurdles Trump faces in courting the Republican money crowd. This week, Trump slashed his original fundraising expectations, saying he no longer believed he needed to raise $1 billion. Some of his top fundraisers think he’ll struggle to top $300 million, a figure that’s less than a third of what Romney raised in 2012 and a small fraction of what Hillary Clinton is expected to bring in.

Some are convinced the situation is growing increasingly bleak. In an interview here, Spencer Zwick, Romney’s former finance chair and one of the most prominent fundraisers in Republican politics, said that some of Romney’s donors would stay on the sidelines — and that others would even give to his Democratic opponent.

“I’m sure you’ll see some that end up supporting Secretary Clinton,” he said.

The interest in Clinton, however peripheral, was on display this week. On Friday, Republican pollster Frank Luntz stood before the approximately 250 attendees and asked them who they planned to vote for. Trump got the most claps, but Clinton got a few as well, said two people who were in the room. One person clapped loudly for Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson.

Even among those who say they’ll support Trump, though, there’s little appetite to give. Frank VanderSloot, an Idaho billionaire who oversees a nutritional supplement company, said he was behind Trump but hasn’t donated because the New York businessman has so far succeeded in running a low-budget campaign that’s centered on free media attention.

“Who knows if he’ll need our money?” he asked.

Many here are shifting their attention to down-ballot races. Zwick, who was courted by a number of 2016 GOP contenders and met with Trump, has been tapped to run Ryan’s finance operation. Rakolta said he’d also become heavily involved in the battle to protect the House majority and recently hosted a fundraiser to benefit Ryan. VanderSloot, meanwhile, said he planned to meet with Romney over the weekend to discuss Senate races.

“We are doing everything we can to put our money in the right places and to save the Senate,” VanderSloot said.

And while they may be reluctant to admit it, some are starting to think about the next presidential election — in 2020. Among those making the trek to Utah this week were Ryan, Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton, Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker — all of whom were seen here as potential future White House contenders. All were mobbed.

There are even some who are still holding out hope that Romney, who has been scalding in his criticism of Trump, will reconsider his decision to stay out of the 2016 campaign and find some way to become a candidate. Over the course of the week, a number of supporters approached the 2012 nominee to ask him to enter the fray. His typical response, according to those who witnessed the exchanges: There’s no path for me.

Yet Romney, like many of those present, didn’t hold back in his criticism of his party’s presumptive nominee. On Saturday morning, during a question-and-answer session before the group that was moderated by CNN’s Wolf Blitzer, Romney defended his decision to speak out against Trump. In explaining why he’d decided to come out so forcefully against the party’s presumptive nominee — and at a time when many GOP leaders are urging unity — Romney appeared to tear up. He was convinced, he said, that Trump just couldn’t go unanswered.

“Seeing this just breaks your heart,” he said.

Behind the scenes, Trump’s team — concerned that Romney’s attacks are hampering the mogul’s efforts to make inroads in the donor community — has been looking to ease tensions with the former Massachusetts governor. On Friday afternoon, after Romney told CNN that a Trump presidency could result in “trickle-down racism,” RNC Chairman Reince Priebus took to Twitter to say he “couldn’t disagree more,” and that it was “time to stop this and unify.” But before he published the tweet, according to two sources familiar with the back-and-forth, Priebus’s team gave Romney a conciliatory head’s up. On Friday evening, Priebus and Romney were seen having a private conversation at a patio reception outside the luxurious Stein Eriksen ski lodge, where the summit was being held. (Spokespersons for Priebus and Romney declined to comment.)

Priebus and Anthony Scaramucci, a Wall Street investor who is helping Trump, spent hours at the lodge huddling with Romney’s allies.

Trump’s fundraisers, who acknowledge the challenge they face, are also taking steps to expand their candidate’s limited donor network. One said the campaign was working to establish a multi-city bundler program that, it hoped, could raise as much as $300 million.

Still, many are struggling to see a clear path forward. Zwick noted that Trump is far behind where Romney was in the donor chase at this point four years ago. One option, he said, is for Trump to accept public financing. Under federal election laws, that would allow him to receive a lump sum of government funds while capping how much he’d be able to spend. In 2008, John McCain accepted public financing but found himself massively outspent by Barack Obama.

The prospect of a controversial billionaire accepting taxpayer funding would be one of the more bizarre twists of the 2016 campaign. But for a struggling Trump, it might be worth pursuing — especially with rising doubts about whether he can fill his coffers.

“Could they get organized and pull it off? Sure,” Zwick said. “They don’t have a lot of time left.”",www.politico.com,left,AlPssNn8MuIqFd90

The latest evidence came in Thursday’s third-quarter FEC report, which showed a $3.9 million haul, mostly from small donors, and spending on many of the trappings of a typical presidential campaign: $40,000 on ballot access consulting, $7,500 on policy consulting and payments to a growing roster of staffers and consultants in early voting states.

The report also revealed more than $35,000 of spending on direct mail in Iowa and New Hampshire, $13,000 for bumper stickers and $6,000 in payments to a Virginia company for radio media placements for a campaign that so far has avoided making major ad buys.

The campaign had already lined up local heavyweights in South Carolina, where former state house majority leader James Merrill is state director, and in Iowa, where Chuck Laudner, a veteran of Mike Huckabee’s and Rick Santorum’s winning caucus campaigns, is state director. Merrill’s firm takes in $25,000 a month from the campaign, while Laudner’s firm takes in $15,000 a month.

In New Hampshire, where Trump was the first candidate to bring on paid staffers, the state headquarters in Manchester buzzes with the coming and going of volunteers. When Trump is not in town, his New Hampshire campaign continues its work, said veteran Republican strategist Dave Carney, who remains neutral and whose wife Lauren is Carly Fiorina’s New Hampshire state director.

“They’re doing what the average campaign is doing for sure. Maybe more,” said Carney.

In South Carolina, volunteers have been put to work setting up events, distributing bumper stickers and yard signs, and performing data entry.

Trump’s campaign has offices in Myrtle Beach, Columbia, and Charleston. There is talk of a fourth office set to open in Greenville, which will give it a larger footprint in the state than almost any other campaign.

“They’re very involved,” Heather Stancil, co-chair of the Madison County Iowa Republicans, said of Trump’s operation in the first caucus state. “He has people who try to be everywhere. In fact, he had people at our Madison County Covered Bridge Festival … in a small town, it’s always nice to have folks show up and walk in your parade.”

Stancil said only three other campaigns, those of Carly Fiorina, Ben Carson and Ted Cruz, mustered visible presences at the festival.

In August, the campaign hired Charles Munoz, a veteran of the Koch Brothers’ Americans for Prosperity, as state director in Nevada. His payment for September was $4,000.

That month, the campaign began looking beyond the early states and holding rallies in Super Tuesday states that will vote on March 1, including Alabama, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Georgia, and Virginia. On Friday evening, Trump held a rally at an elementary school in Massachusetts, another March 1st state.

Trump’s rallies, which regularly dwarf those of his Republican rivals and draw thousands of attendees, help the campaign build out infrastructure in those states by requiring supporters to fill out personal information to reserve tickets online.

The campaign has taken its organization in many of these states to the next level, announcing the hiring of state directors in, Texas, Virginia, Georgia, Tennessee and Alabama in recent weeks. It has also brought on state directors for Illinois and Florida, which vote on March 15.

In Virginia, Trump’s newly hired state field director, Dena Espencheid, a Tea Party grassroots organizer, has been organizing volunteers to gather signatures to get him onto that state’s ballot.

While all of this signals a serious turn for Trump's campaign, he is still spending far less than other 2016 GOP contenders on traditional campaign activities, including ad buys and polling.

Democratic operatives , worried that election night could be a major disappointment , are preparing a damage control offensive meant to convince the rich liberals who opened their wallets wide in 2014 that their money wasn ’ t spent in vain .
Efforts are being made to temper donors ’ expectations by reminding them that oddsmakers had been predicting a Republican wave , while emphasizing the potential long-term impact of sustained big spending to promote liberal candidates and ideas .
The goal is to avoid a big money drop-off from rich Democrats who had initially been reluctant to embrace super PACs but who came off the sidelines in a substantial way for the first time in 2014 . The plan is to quickly shift their focus to 2016 , when Democrats face a much more hospitable Senate map and a potentially historic presidential campaign .
The influential Democracy Alliance club of wealthy liberal donors is convening a closed-door conference beginning Nov. 12 called “ To 2020 and Beyond : Our Progressive Vision. ” Meanwhile , major donors and operatives supporting Hillary Clinton ’ s prospective presidential campaign are planning to urge her to announce her intentions in the coming weeks to re-energize major donors behind her candidacy or , if she passes on the race , allow them to rally behind another candidate .
“ If Hillary is going to run , it would be best to do it quickly post-election , ” said Houston trial lawyer Steve Mostyn , a Democracy Alliance member who is on the national finance council of a super PAC paving the way for a Clinton run . “ Any midterm election hangover … would resolve quickly . ”
Mostyn , along with his wife , Amber , and their law firm , donated more than $ 2 million to Democratic politicians and committees in 2014 . Donors “ will not be happy , ” if the Democrats lose the Senate , ” he said , “ but I believe it will have little effect , because the field flips in 2016 . ”
But while supporters see a Clinton 2016 campaign as a uniting force , it also could splinter the liberal moneyed class . There is a faction of very affluent anybody-but-Hillary Democrats — including a significant contingent within the ranks of the Democracy Alliance — eager to fund a rival who would run to Clinton ’ s left on issues including income inequality , climate change and national security .
Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren — who has repeatedly said she does not intend to run for president despite being urged to do so by Democracy Alliance donors — will address the group ’ s conference , according to a draft agenda reviewed by ███ .
Clinton , however , was not invited , according to sources familiar with the conference .
Democracy Alliance President Gara LaMarche said Warren is slated to talk about economic opportunity — one of the major themes of the conference . “ It ’ s not a roadshow for a presidential candidate , ” he said . “ Hillary Clinton is a very popular person in the Democracy Alliance . ”
The club ’ s four-day conference is the Democracy Alliance ’ s traditional annual winter gathering , and was not planned specifically to buck up its donors — or partners , in DA parlance — after a midterm election that has long looked to favor Republicans . But there are a number of sessions that seem intended to demonstrate the effectiveness of big money spending , regardless of the final Senate result .
One session featuring Democratic data gurus Laura Quinn of Catalist and Tate Hausman of the Analyst Institute “ will peek behind the curtain to describe and illustrate how the progressive community combined Catalist data and Analyst Institute experiments to mobilize voters in 2014. ” Called “ More Bang for the Buck , ” the session is hosted by billionaire Democracy Alliance founding partner George Soros , as well as the AFL-CIO and the National Education Association , among others .
Another panel , featuring Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards and veteran Democratic pollster Celinda Lake , will endeavor to answer some key questions about the midterms : “ Were progressives able to mobilize base voters , persuade swing voters and lay the groundwork for a progressive restoration in 2016 ? ”
The group that could be under the most pressure to justify its 2014 spending is Senate Majority PAC , a super PAC blessed by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid . Through the middle of October , it had raised $ 53 million for its 2014 efforts , largely from major donors , including key Democracy Alliance partners . The DA had recommended they consider contributions to the group and to a super PAC endorsed by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called House Majority PAC .
Reid and Pelosi had assiduously courted major donors to give to the super PACs , while operatives warned that , without well-funded outside groups , Democrats risked getting drowned under a gusher of Republican big money in 2014 .
Senate Majority PAC , in particular , has been pre-emptively making the case that , even if Democrats don ’ t keep the Senate , it succeeded in significantly improving the landscape and very likely blocking a national GOP wave . It spent millions of dollars airing advertisements that sought to define GOP candidates challenging Democratic incumbents in Arkansas , Colorado , Louisiana and North Carolina — all races that are neck-and-neck headed into Election Day .
“ In the worst political environment for either party in 25 years , one of the reasons why every one of these races is a competitive jump ball is because of early outside spending by groups like ours , combined of course with good candidates with a positive vision for the country , ” said Ty Matsdorf , a Senate Majority PAC spokesman .
Democratic fundraisers have been careful not to engage in the sort aggressive overpromising that came back to haunt some of the Republican groups that combined to raise about $ 1 billion in 2012 for an unsuccessful effort to unseat President Barack Obama and capture the Senate .
Karl Rove ’ s Crossroads groups , in particular , faced angry calls from donors demanding to know how its overly optimistic projections had proved so wrong .
“ People are prepared , ” LaMarche said . “ If we lose , the consequences of Republican control of the Senate won ’ t be so good on things like judicial confirmations . But as a political matter , I don ’ t read the donors as being discouraged about their investments . I think they will have felt they did the best job they could in a difficult environment . ”
Plus , LaMarche pointed out , Democrats stand to do well in governor ’ s races across the country . That , he argued , would be “ a repudiation ” of the agenda implemented by Republicans who rode the tea party wave of 2010 , and it would also help advance the long-term goals of Democracy Alliance donors and groups .
Pointing to the conference ’ s name , LaMarche said his club ’ s focus is on creating a political landscape in which progressives and their policies can carry the day for years , not just a single election .
“ We ’ re thinking about the next three or four cycles . So that , by 2020 or 2021 , progressives are in the position to make sure the lines aren ’ t drawn in a way that impairs our power for the next 10 years , ” he said , referring to the once-a-decade congressional redistricting process , which both sides target as a major strategic battleground .
Getting donors to buy into a long view of public policy and political fights is a technique used to great effect by the political operation created by the conservative billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch . Their operation spent $ 400 million in the run-up to 2012 but largely avoided the types of doubts from its donors that dogged Rove . That ’ s partly because the brothers and their allies went to great lengths to detail how the cash was spent and how they could improve , but also partly because they ’ ve long cast their efforts as a generational struggle to re-center American politics around their ideas .
That ’ s the way 2014 ’ s biggest donor of disclosed cash — Tom Steyer — sees it , though he has portrayed himself as the Koch brothers ’ antithesis .
The San Francisco hedge fund billionaire , a Democracy Alliance partner , has donated more than $ 74 million in 2014 , including $ 67 million to his own super PAC , NextGen Climate Action , devoted to elevating climate change as a voting issue . Though it ’ s spent the bulk of its cash opposing Republican Senate candidates deemed bad on the issue , Steyer will not be discouraged if Republicans win control of the Senate , asserted his political adviser Chris Lehane .
“ This has always been a multi-cycle plan , ” Lehane said , asserting that the effort has already been successful in changing the way that politicians talk about climate change and showing that it can be used as a wedge issue .
“ The activity this cycle is only going to intensify because of the urgency of climate , ” he said , explaining that “ this is really the pivot to ’ 16. ” Steyer , he said , is “ just getting started . ”","The goal is to avoid a big money drop-off from rich Democrats.

Democratic fundraisers have been careful not to engage in the sort aggressive overpromising that came back to haunt some of the Republican groups that combined to raise about $1 billion in 2012 for an unsuccessful effort to unseat President Barack Obama and capture the Senate.

Karl Rove’s Crossroads groups, in particular, faced angry calls from donors demanding to know how its overly optimistic projections had proved so wrong.

“People are prepared,” LaMarche said. “If we lose, the consequences of Republican control of the Senate won’t be so good on things like judicial confirmations. But as a political matter, I don’t read the donors as being discouraged about their investments. I think they will have felt they did the best job they could in a difficult environment.”

Plus, LaMarche pointed out, Democrats stand to do well in governor’s races across the country. That, he argued, would be “a repudiation” of the agenda implemented by Republicans who rode the tea party wave of 2010, and it would also help advance the long-term goals of Democracy Alliance donors and groups.

Pointing to the conference’s name, LaMarche said his club’s focus is on creating a political landscape in which progressives and their policies can carry the day for years, not just a single election.

“We’re thinking about the next three or four cycles. So that, by 2020 or 2021, progressives are in the position to make sure the lines aren’t drawn in a way that impairs our power for the next 10 years,” he said, referring to the once-a-decade congressional redistricting process, which both sides target as a major strategic battleground.

Getting donors to buy into a long view of public policy and political fights is a technique used to great effect by the political operation created by the conservative billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch. Their operation spent $400 million in the run-up to 2012 but largely avoided the types of doubts from its donors that dogged Rove. That’s partly because the brothers and their allies went to great lengths to detail how the cash was spent and how they could improve, but also partly because they’ve long cast their efforts as a generational struggle to re-center American politics around their ideas.

That’s the way 2014’s biggest donor of disclosed cash — Tom Steyer — sees it, though he has portrayed himself as the Koch brothers’ antithesis.

The San Francisco hedge fund billionaire, a Democracy Alliance partner, has donated more than $74 million in 2014, including $67 million to his own super PAC, NextGen Climate Action, devoted to elevating climate change as a voting issue. Though it’s spent the bulk of its cash opposing Republican Senate candidates deemed bad on the issue, Steyer will not be discouraged if Republicans win control of the Senate, asserted his political adviser Chris Lehane.

“This has always been a multi-cycle plan,” Lehane said, asserting that the effort has already been successful in changing the way that politicians talk about climate change and showing that it can be used as a wedge issue.

“The activity this cycle is only going to intensify because of the urgency of climate,” he said, explaining that “this is really the pivot to ’16.” Steyer, he said, is “just getting started.”",www.politico.com,left,LJBd8Y8OhYj8GFVO

Both the Club for Growth and the Senate Conservatives Fund – two of the most prominent groups that have boosted candidates on the right – mocked the new initiative as yet another hapless establishment-side attempt to muzzle the GOP base.

Matt Hoskins, executive director of the Senate Conservatives Fund, branded it the “Conservative Defeat Project.”

“The Conservative Defeat Project is yet another example of the Republican establishment’s hostility toward its conservative base. Rather than listening to the grassroots and working to advance their principles, the establishment has chosen to declare war on the party’s most loyal supporters,” Hoskins said. “If they keep this up, the party will remain in the wilderness for decades to come.”

Trump has been actively soliciting cash for only a few months , but when he reveals his campaign ’ s financials later this week they will show he has crushed the total haul from small-dollar donors to the past two Republican nominees , John McCain and Mitt Romney — during the entirety of their campaigns .
All told , Trump is approaching , or may have already passed , $ 100 million from donors who have given $ 200 or less , according to an analysis of available Federal Election Commission filings , the campaign ’ s public statements and people familiar with his fundraising operation . It is a threshold no other Republican has ever achieved in a single campaign . And Trump has done so less than three months after signing his first email solicitation for donors on June 21 — a staggering speed to collect such a vast sum .
“ I ’ ve never seen anything like this , ” said a senior Republican operative who has worked closely with the campaign ’ s small-dollar fundraising operation . “ He ’ s the Republican Obama in terms of online fundraising . ”
Clinton counted 2.3 million donors as of the end of August , the result of decades of campaigning , a previous presidential bid and allies who painstakingly built her an email file of supporters even before she formally announced her second run . But Trump had zoomed to 2.1 million donors in the past three months alone , his campaign has said .
The question now is what the gusher means for the GOP . The Republican National Committee , through a deal struck with Trump in May , is getting 20 percent of the proceeds from its small-donor operation for Trump plus access to this invaluable new donor and email file . But can Trump ’ s candidacy help close the Republican Party ’ s small-donor divide in one fell swoop ? Will these donors — 2.1 million and counting — give to other Republicans ? Will they drag the Republican Party in Trump ’ s direction for years to come ? Or , if he loses , will they simply vanish ?
“ The challenge is that we still have a divided party , ” said Mindy Finn , who led Romney ’ s digital team in 2008 and worked for George W. Bush ’ s reelection in 2004 .
Trump has found record-setting success as the first Republican nominee “ in the Internet age ” to have made empowering the grass roots and railing against the elite a core of his campaign message , Finn said . Going forward , the key will be whether his donors can be convinced to give to a candidate with just a bit less bombast . “ Can you be a populist without being a barnburner ? ” she asked . “ And thus still be able to raise this kind of money ? ”
Or , as a second operative who has worked with Trump ’ s small-dollar fundraising operation , put it , “ I don ’ t know how much these Trump donors — if he doesn ’ t win — want to give to the RNC . ”
Trump , a self-proclaimed billionaire who bragged during the primaries about how he didn ’ t need anyone else ’ s cash to run for president , would appear at first to be the unlikeliest of Republican fundraising heroes . But the combination of his celebrity , anti-establishment populism , and running against Clinton has led to a windfall , even as his skeletal campaign did little for more than a year to cultivate a donor list or build digital infrastructure to lure contributors .
“ People are pouring in , and we ’ re having to manage the inflow , ” said one of the operatives familiar with the Trump operation .
It is impossible to piece together a complete picture of Trump ’ s finances due to different reporting deadlines for Trump ’ s various committees . But as of the end of July , he had amassed $ 50 million in small contributions into his campaign , FEC records show . He has since announced he raised $ 90 million in August “ mostly ” from small donors both directly for his campaign and in joint committees shared with the Republican National Committee — suggesting at least $ 45 million raised last month came from small contributors . Additionally , there is some money from small contributors in those shared RNC accounts — Trump said they contained $ 37 million at the end of July — that he has helped raise .
Trump ’ s success dwarfs those of his GOP predecessors . McCain and Romney , in 2008 and 2012 , respectively , raised just less than $ 64 million in contributions of $ 200 or less , according to FEC records ( McCain , notably , accepted public funds in the 2008 general election ) .
Trump still lags far behind the pace-setting Democrats . President Obama raised an enormous $ 483.6 million in contributions of $ 200 or less in 2012 , FEC records show . Sanders raised almost $ 202 million in small donations just during the 2016 primary . And Clinton raised almost $ 156 million in such contributions through the end of July , according to the FEC .
Democrats seem to vacillate between comforting themselves with all that Trump continues to do wrong — botching Mike Pence ’ s announcement , the high spam rate on their first email , the volume of ads targeting Democrats — and concern about his successes in spite of that .
“ I would just put it in the perspective of they ’ re still not doing as well as they should be doing , and they ’ re doing too little too late , ” said Kenneth Pennington , who served as digital director for Sanders . “ Once they start copying some of the things Democrats are doing , then I ’ ll get worried . ”
Trump is certainly spending big to raise small money . In July , he poured $ 8.4 million into his San Antonio-based digital firm , Giles-Parscale , most of which was spent on online advertising and prospecting for donors . People familiar with the Trump operation say that the campaign has essentially told digital vendors that it will run as many Facebook and Google ads as possible , so long as investing in the particular ad is generating positive cash flow , or return on investment .
“ We ’ ve had a positive ROI on everything , ” said one Trump campaign official .
Brad Parscale , who runs the Trump digital operation and began working for the Trump family before it entered politics , has increasingly begun traveling to New York and accumulating power within the campaign . Last week , Donald Trump Jr. visited Parscale ’ s operation in San Antonio to thank the employees , and RNC officials , dispatched there .
“ Every time there ’ s been a change in leadership , he ’ s gotten significantly more authority , ” an operative who has worked with the campaign said of Parscale . Of course , the ever-increasing flow of money to Trump Tower has certainly helped .
On Aug. 31 , the day Trump went to Mexico and the last day of the reporting period that will be revealed this week , Trump raised an enormous $ 5 million . The campaign ran a dizzying 107,000 different ad combinations on Facebook on that day alone , according to Lindsay Walters , a Republican National Committee spokeswoman , swapping out different text , graphics and videos to determine what performed strongest .
A typical day involves 40,000 to 50,000 such combinations , Walters said . Another person familiar with the Trump and RNC digital operation said there has been some strain simply creating content fast enough to fill all the ad slots that are making them money .
In an atypical arrangement for a presidential campaign , the RNC is actually taking a cut of all the small-dollar fundraising done through its joint committee with Trump ( Romney received 100 percent of the joint committee ’ s small donations , in contrast ) . The agreement was struck back in May , when Trump emerged as the nominee with little infrastructure or experience to execute a large-scale digital operation . As a result , the RNC will end 2016 will access to a far larger email and donor file than ever before .
“ A lot of them probably don ’ t realize that 20 percent of the money goes to the RNC ; otherwise they probably wouldn ’ t give , ” said one of the operatives who has worked with Trump and the RNC . “ People are giving money to the joint fundraising committee because Donald Trump ’ s name is on it . ”

Trump has been actively soliciting cash for only a few months, but when he reveals his campaign’s financials later this week they will show he has crushed the total haul from small-dollar donors to the past two Republican nominees, John McCain and Mitt Romney — during the entirety of their campaigns.

Story Continued Below

All told, Trump is approaching, or may have already passed, $100 million from donors who have given $200 or less, according to an analysis of available Federal Election Commission filings, the campaign’s public statements and people familiar with his fundraising operation. It is a threshold no other Republican has ever achieved in a single campaign. And Trump has done so less than three months after signing his first email solicitation for donors on June 21 — a staggering speed to collect such a vast sum.

“I’ve never seen anything like this,” said a senior Republican operative who has worked closely with the campaign’s small-dollar fundraising operation. “He’s the Republican Obama in terms of online fundraising.”

Clinton counted 2.3 million donors as of the end of August, the result of decades of campaigning, a previous presidential bid and allies who painstakingly built her an email file of supporters even before she formally announced her second run. But Trump had zoomed to 2.1 million donors in the past three months alone, his campaign has said.

The question now is what the gusher means for the GOP. The Republican National Committee, through a deal struck with Trump in May, is getting 20 percent of the proceeds from its small-donor operation for Trump plus access to this invaluable new donor and email file. But can Trump’s candidacy help close the Republican Party’s small-donor divide in one fell swoop? Will these donors — 2.1 million and counting — give to other Republicans? Will they drag the Republican Party in Trump’s direction for years to come? Or, if he loses, will they simply vanish?

“The challenge is that we still have a divided party,” said Mindy Finn, who led Romney’s digital team in 2008 and worked for George W. Bush’s reelection in 2004.

Trump has found record-setting success as the first Republican nominee “in the Internet age” to have made empowering the grass roots and railing against the elite a core of his campaign message, Finn said. Going forward, the key will be whether his donors can be convinced to give to a candidate with just a bit less bombast. “Can you be a populist without being a barnburner?” she asked. “And thus still be able to raise this kind of money?”

Or, as a second operative who has worked with Trump’s small-dollar fundraising operation, put it, “I don’t know how much these Trump donors — if he doesn’t win — want to give to the RNC.”

Trump, a self-proclaimed billionaire who bragged during the primaries about how he didn’t need anyone else’s cash to run for president, would appear at first to be the unlikeliest of Republican fundraising heroes. But the combination of his celebrity, anti-establishment populism, and running against Clinton has led to a windfall, even as his skeletal campaign did little for more than a year to cultivate a donor list or build digital infrastructure to lure contributors.

“People are pouring in, and we’re having to manage the inflow,” said one of the operatives familiar with the Trump operation.

It is impossible to piece together a complete picture of Trump’s finances due to different reporting deadlines for Trump’s various committees. But as of the end of July, he had amassed $50 million in small contributions into his campaign, FEC records show. He has since announced he raised $90 million in August “mostly” from small donors both directly for his campaign and in joint committees shared with the Republican National Committee — suggesting at least $45 million raised last month came from small contributors. Additionally, there is some money from small contributors in those shared RNC accounts — Trump said they contained $37 million at the end of July — that he has helped raise.

Trump’s success dwarfs those of his GOP predecessors. McCain and Romney, in 2008 and 2012, respectively, raised just less than $64 million in contributions of $200 or less, according to FEC records (McCain, notably, accepted public funds in the 2008 general election).

Trump still lags far behind the pace-setting Democrats. President Obama raised an enormous $483.6 million in contributions of $200 or less in 2012, FEC records show. Sanders raised almost $202 million in small donations just during the 2016 primary. And Clinton raised almost $156 million in such contributions through the end of July, according to the FEC.





Democrats seem to vacillate between comforting themselves with all that Trump continues to do wrong — botching Mike Pence’s announcement, the high spam rate on their first email, the volume of ads targeting Democrats — and concern about his successes in spite of that.

“I would just put it in the perspective of they’re still not doing as well as they should be doing, and they’re doing too little too late,” said Kenneth Pennington, who served as digital director for Sanders. “Once they start copying some of the things Democrats are doing, then I’ll get worried.”

Trump is certainly spending big to raise small money. In July, he poured $8.4 million into his San Antonio-based digital firm, Giles-Parscale, most of which was spent on online advertising and prospecting for donors. People familiar with the Trump operation say that the campaign has essentially told digital vendors that it will run as many Facebook and Google ads as possible, so long as investing in the particular ad is generating positive cash flow, or return on investment.

“We’ve had a positive ROI on everything,” said one Trump campaign official.

Brad Parscale, who runs the Trump digital operation and began working for the Trump family before it entered politics, has increasingly begun traveling to New York and accumulating power within the campaign. Last week, Donald Trump Jr. visited Parscale’s operation in San Antonio to thank the employees, and RNC officials, dispatched there.

“Every time there’s been a change in leadership, he’s gotten significantly more authority,” an operative who has worked with the campaign said of Parscale. Of course, the ever-increasing flow of money to Trump Tower has certainly helped.

On Aug. 31, the day Trump went to Mexico and the last day of the reporting period that will be revealed this week, Trump raised an enormous $5 million. The campaign ran a dizzying 107,000 different ad combinations on Facebook on that day alone, according to Lindsay Walters, a Republican National Committee spokeswoman, swapping out different text, graphics and videos to determine what performed strongest.

A typical day involves 40,000 to 50,000 such combinations, Walters said. Another person familiar with the Trump and RNC digital operation said there has been some strain simply creating content fast enough to fill all the ad slots that are making them money.

In an atypical arrangement for a presidential campaign, the RNC is actually taking a cut of all the small-dollar fundraising done through its joint committee with Trump (Romney received 100 percent of the joint committee’s small donations, in contrast). The agreement was struck back in May, when Trump emerged as the nominee with little infrastructure or experience to execute a large-scale digital operation. As a result, the RNC will end 2016 will access to a far larger email and donor file than ever before.

“A lot of them probably don’t realize that 20 percent of the money goes to the RNC; otherwise they probably wouldn’t give,” said one of the operatives who has worked with Trump and the RNC. “People are giving money to the joint fundraising committee because Donald Trump’s name is on it.”

Indeed, almost all of the ads prominently incorporate Trump’s image or name — offering dinner with Trump, coffee with Ivanka Trump, lunch with Eric Trump. And the appeals aren’t just for petty cash. Trump has run an extensive email campaign asking for $184 for signed copies of “The Art of the Deal” — an unusually large sum to seek online. “We wouldn’t be running all that stuff if it wasn’t working,” said a person who has worked with the campaign.

In a sign of the potency of Trump’s name, others are trying to capitalize as well. The National Republican Senatorial Committee, the campaign arm of Senate Republicans, has been blitzing its own email list with Trump-themed missives. So far in September, the NRSC has offered Trump-Pence yard signs, bumper stickers, bracelets, magnets and T-shirts, even as strategists have urged Senate candidates themselves to distance themselves from Trump on the trail.

Other, insurgent-style Republicans have found success among small donors in the past. Ben Carson’s primary campaign floundered but he still raised $48 million among those who gave $200 or less. Ted Cruz raised more than $60 million from such givers before he dropped out.

That is the catch-22 for a Republican establishment that, thanks to Trump, is now awash in a potentially powerful list of new givers — the energy and money is for the anti-establishment candidates.

Fred Malek, a top Republican presidential fundraiser for decades, said Trump’s singular appeal to small donors could be just that. “It seems to me that it is not necessarily transferrable,” he said.

Only a quarter of the top conservative donors in 2012 and 2014 have decided to exclusively support one White House hopeful , according to a CNN analysis of super PAC filings posted Friday . In a splintered field where no presidential candidate holds a commanding lead , the records reveal in the clearest terms yet just how few financiers have made their decisions .
Some , like casino magnate Sheldon Adelson , the party 's top giver in 2012 , have not cut any checks to Republican candidates ' allied groups . Others , like Houston Texans owner Bob McNair , have donated simultaneously to as many as four aspirants , spreading their money around the field .
`` There 's nobody clearly ahead , '' said Jay Bergman , a top Republican donor who has given sparingly to the super PACs that have courted him for the past six months . `` Until that emerges , a lot of people are not going to commit themselves . ''
Months before they formally announced their bids , potential candidates courted contributors at lavish resorts and with one-on-one visits . This weekend , five Republican hopefuls will travel to Dana Point to woo the network of donors organized by Charles and David Koch , two of the country 's richest Americans who themselves have not donated to any candidate 's super PAC so far .
Those groups raised $ 250 million in the first half of 2015 , records show , $ 103 million of which was raised by the super PAC supporting former Florida Gov . Jeb Bush . Four years ago , Mitt Romney 's super PAC led the field at the time by raising $ 12 million in the same filing period .
Thanks to 2010 Supreme Court decisions that led to an explosion in super PACs , which can accept unlimited donations from individuals and corporations , nearly every candidate has eyed the nation 's billionaires to bankroll their political ambitions . And the reports Friday reveal they 're as dependent as ever on their goodwill : A single hand 's worth of Republican funders comprise a majority of most of the allied outside spending groups that will go to war with one another this year as the Iowa caucuses approach .
But these donors ' influence will wane as more and more well-heeled contributors join in the political giving that they revolutionized in 2012 and 2014 . Fundraisers and Republican operatives say that when the super PACs file their next campaign finance reports in early January , many of the top donors will no longer be uncommitted .
`` Voters , as well as donors , may have preferences , but the numbers are really soft , '' Saul Anuzis , a fundraiser for the Republican Governors Association , said of the current landscape . `` Just like any activist letting it play itself out , there are lots of donors letting the final process play itself out . ''
In addition to Adelson and the Kochs , New York investor Paul Singer , who gave $ 10.5 million to outside groups in 2014 , remains uncommitted . As do Silicon Valley angel investor Peter Thiel and Kentucky executive Wayne Hughes .
And they 're not alone , according to a CNN analysis that tracked current giving by 90 people who were ranked by the Center for Responsive Politics as being among the most prolific donors to conservative groups in 2012 and 2014 . Among those donors , half are currently sitting out .
But for those who are giving , they seem to have a strong preference for the governors in the race .
Bush has a clear lead among the mega-donors in CNN 's analysis , with 30 % of the elite donors giving to his super PAC , Right to Rise USA . No other candidate in the race was able to persuade so many of the top conservative donors to open their wallets at this early stage .
Wisconsin Gov . Scott Walker has also made inroads with this elite group . In all , $ 19 million of the $ 20 million raised by Unintimidated PAC came from these top Republicans . A quarter of that came from Chicago Cubs owner Joe Ricketts and his wife , who gave $ 5 million .
Another favorite is New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie , but his mega-donors are hedging their bets . The five donors that contributed to his super PAC also gave to groups supporting Bush , Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and former Hewlett-Packard Chief Executive Carly Fiorina .
With an unprecedented number of hopefuls in the race , many donors are shying away from investing in just one candidate . Half of the elite donors who are giving this year donated to multiple groups .
`` A lot of it is bet-hedging , '' said top donor John Jordan , who owns a California winery and is backing Scott Walker . `` That 's what a lot of people do if they like more than one . ''
Candidates like Rubio , Fiorina and Louisiana Gov . Bobby Jindal were the second choice of many who gave to multiple groups , according to the CNN analysis .
The most prolific double-donator was McNair , the Texans owner , who contributed $ 500,000 to groups supporting Bush , Walker , Cruz and Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina .
Still , it 's impossible to know for sure how much money is flowing . Super PACs must disclose their donors , as they did Friday with hundreds of pages of filings with the Federal Election Commission . But for donors looking to give discreetly , some candidates have allied nonprofit organizations that are registered with the IRS but do n't ever have to name names .
Super PACs are taking over more and more functions of traditional campaigns this cycle , with the outside groups organizing field programs in early-voting states and even announcing endorsements given to the official campaign . But the risk for candidates is that these groups are heavily dependent on a few billionaires to sustain their presidential operations .
Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas , who shocked many Republicans by corralling $ 38 million for his super PAC , raised $ 36 million of that from three families alone . Former Arkansas Gov . Mike Huckabee , a favorite of Iowa evangelicals , posted only a $ 3.6 million haul -- a sum that would be significantly lower had Arkansas poultry producer Ronnie Cameron not given Huckabee 's group $ 3 million .
The fortunes of groups linked to top-tier Republican candidates like Walker and Rubio were similarly attached to the pockets of their financiers : Half of Walker 's $ 20 million haul came from two people . Half of Rubio 's came from two .
Some other Republicans showed the potential to have a deeper reservoir of financial firepower . Bush shattered fundraising records by deploying his family 's fundraising network to collect $ 103 million for his super PAC . But he also built that support on a wider base : His top 24 donors only accounted for about a quarter of all the money raised .
But candidates should n't fear that juggernaut , said Anuzis , who is supporting Cruz .
`` With almost all the candidates in single digits , this is a wide open ballgame , '' he said .","Washington (CNN) The nation's most elite conservative donors are just as split as Republican voters are about who to support for president -- and it's keeping many of the leading moneymen on the sidelines of the campaign as it barrels through the summer of 2015.

'Bet-hedging'

With an unprecedented number of hopefuls in the race, many donors are shying away from investing in just one candidate. Half of the elite donors who are giving this year donated to multiple groups.

""A lot of it is bet-hedging,"" said top donor John Jordan, who owns a California winery and is backing Scott Walker. ""That's what a lot of people do if they like more than one.""

Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who shocked many Republicans by corralling $38 million for his super PAC, raised $36 million of that from three families alone. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a favorite of Iowa evangelicals, posted only a $3.6 million haul -- a sum that would be significantly lower had Arkansas poultry producer Ronnie Cameron not given Huckabee's group $3 million.

The fortunes of groups linked to top-tier Republican candidates like Walker and Rubio were similarly attached to the pockets of their financiers: Half of Walker's $20 million haul came from two people. Half of Rubio's came from two.

Some other Republicans showed the potential to have a deeper reservoir of financial firepower. Bush shattered fundraising records by deploying his family's fundraising network to collect $103 million for his super PAC. But he also built that support on a wider base: His top 24 donors only accounted for about a quarter of all the money raised.

But candidates shouldn't fear that juggernaut, said Anuzis, who is supporting Cruz.

The Frackers

The great American energy boom of the last decade has produced a wave of new billionaires and multimillionaires. Now they are throwing tens of millions of dollars into the presidential campaign, with the biggest checks going almost exclusively to Republicans and their “super PACs.” The top donors include Trevor Rees-Jones, who left a law practice in Dallas and turned $4,000 in savings into an energy empire as the head of Chief Oil and Gas; Dan and Farris Wilks, abortion opponents whose trucking and equipment business struck gold in the fracking boom; and Karen Buchwald Wright, the head of Ariel Corporation, an Ohio manufacturer of gas compressors.

Old Oil

Established Texas oil families are deeply involved in the campaign, too. Descendants of the late gambler and oil speculator H.L. Hunt – once thought to be the richest man in America – account for at least $2.3 million in donations in this presidential campaign. Mr. Hunt’s fortune, feuds and multiple marriages are the stuff of legend: In the late 1970s, two of his sons reputedly tried to corner the silver market, and some say the Hunts inspired the classic television series “Dallas.” At least three of his descendants have followed his path in Republican politics in the 2016 campaign.

Hedge Fund Partners, Political Opposites

‘WE’RE IN A CRISIS’

Vogel, Eliza Collins","Some of the biggest Republican donors , who collectively have contributed tens of millions of dollars to shape the presidential race , are tightening their purse strings out of frustration with their inability to boost their favored candidates , or to slow Donald Trump .
Rather than continuing to write huge checks to support the cluster of establishment candidates jockeying to emerge as the leading alternative to Trump , a billionaire real estate showman roundly despised by the GOP elite , these donors have mostly retreated to the sidelines . They ’ re watching anxiously , hoping that the field sorts itself out , according to interviews with a half dozen major donors or their representatives .
Many of the donors are urging the deep-pocketed groups they ’ ve already funded to begin spending against Trump , even as some recognize the potential for such spending to backfire , and are increasingly questioning the efficacy of big-money advertising campaigns more generally .
“ It ’ s unbelievable . I mean Jeb Bush spent $ 42 million in New Hampshire ― what did he get for it ? ” said billionaire GOP mega-donor Stan Hubbard , a Minnesota media mogul . “ It ’ s frustrating . ”
Hubbard and his family initially supported Scott Walker ’ s now-aborted campaign for the GOP nomination , donating more than $ 105,000 to the various committees supporting the Wisconsin governor . He was seen as a leading contender to unite the party ’ s conservative and business-centrist factions , but he never caught on , despite $ 24 million in super PAC support .
After Walker dropped out , the Hubbards played the GOP presidential field a bit , donating nearly $ 40,000 to committees supporting Bush , Marco Rubio and Ben Carson , as well as the since-aborted campaigns of Carly Fiorina and Chris Christie .
“ That ’ s money down the drain , ” Hubbard told ███ , adding that his latest hope to take down Trump is John Kasich . Hubbard and his wife each gave the maximum $ 2,700 contribution to the Ohio governor ’ s campaign for the nomination after he came in second in Tuesday ’ s New Hampshire ’ s primary . While Kasich finished well behind Trump , the showing was enough to attract interest from a handful of mega-donors who had previously supported other GOP candidates .
Home Depot founder Ken Langone , who previously had donated $ 250,000 to a super PAC supporting Christie , declared his support for Kasich and began calling other mega-donors , including Hubbard , to make the pitch .
“ Guess what , Ken ? You and I are on the same page , ” Hubbard said he told Langone . “ We just did the same thing ― sent money to Kasich. ” But Hubbard said he planned to wait to see how Kasich did in the upcoming primaries before writing a check to his super PAC — and fundraising sources said that ’ s the way that many free agent GOP mega-donors are approaching the tumultuous primary .
“ Most donors are sitting tight not knowing what to do , ” said one top GOP fundraiser .
Rubio was close to coalescing support from the elite donor class , the fundraiser said , until his widely panned debate performance in New Hampshire primary and subsequent fifth-place finish in the state ’ s primary . “ If he had finished second in New Hampshire or even a really close third , it would be a three-man race between Trump , Cruz and Rubio , ” said the fundraiser . “ If Rubio pulls it back together and gets on a minor roll in South Carolina , I think he can relatively quickly come back . Not because there ’ s such a deep loyalty to him from donors , but because they are so worried and desperately want someone to step forward to take on Trump . ”
Several donors expressed frustration that the establishment candidates and the super PACs supporting them spent considerable time and money attacking one another ― and not Trump ― in the run-up to the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary .
Perhaps as a result , many donors who supported candidates who have since dropped out appear inclined to wait until after the Feb. 20 South Carolina primary to pick a new horse .
Wisconsin roofing billionaire Diane Hendricks , who gave $ 5 million to a pro-Walker super PAC and is being hotly courted by supporters of both Rubio and Ted Cruz , intends to wait until the cluster of primaries and caucuses on March 1 ― Super Tuesday ― before backing another candidate , said sources familiar with her plans .
Wyoming mutual fund pioneer Foster Friess , who supported Rick Santorum , this week told ███ ― presumably with tongue planted in cheek ― “ I am still in the fetal position in my bed where I probably will be for the next 30 days after Rick 's decision to drop out . ”
He added on a more serious note that he ’ s not interested in backing candidates or groups training their fire on GOP rivals . “ I want to try to play a conciliatory role . For us to win in November , all of these warring factions must kiss and make up , ” Friess said . “ I have huge respect for the efforts all the candidates are extending , but only wish they would direct their attacks toward the goofy Democrat ideas rather than a circular firing squad . ”
Arkansas poultry magnate Ronnie Cameron , who donated $ 3 million to a super PAC supporting former Arkansas Gov . Mike Huckabee ’ s since-aborted presidential campaign , said he had no immediate plans to give to any of them . “ Maybe after South Carolina , ” Cameron told ███ , though he added he “ may not do anything else ” with super PACs for the rest of the cycle .
GOP mega-donor John Jordan , who decided to support Rubio after Walker ― his first choice ― dropped out , predicted that one of the remaining establishment candidates would emerge from the pack on March 15 , when a handful of delegate-rich states hold primaries .
“ One of them will do better than the other , and it will be impossible for the relative loser to make the case to donors that he should continue , '' he told the Associated Press . Pointing specifically to Bush and Rubio ― the former governor and current senator , respectively , from Florida , which is among the March 15 states ― he said `` donors will simply move to whoever wins that state , and it will happen nearly instantly . ”
But some donors worry that , by then , Trump might be unbeatable .
They ’ re looking for one of the existing deep-pocketed outside groups to take action sooner to halt Trump ’ s rise , with several donors specifically citing the political operation helmed by the billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch .
At its winter gathering of major donors a couple weeks ago in Indian Wells , Calif. , operatives floated the possibility of launching an anti-Trump campaign , according to sources who attended . They said donors were mostly receptive . The Koch network , which intends to spend $ 889 million on policy and political advocacy in the run-up to the 2016 election , hasn ’ t previously ventured aggressively into GOP primaries , and sources familiar with the network say there is an intensive debate about the timing and details of a possible anti-Trump campaign .
The Minnesota mega-donor Hubbard , who has donated hundreds of thousands to the Koch network over the years ( including at least $ 50,000 last year ) , but did not attend the winter meeting , said he planned to call Koch operatives to make the case that they should intervene .
“ It ’ s time to start educating , ” he said . “ It ’ s obvious that there is no way that we ’ re going to be able to make Mexico pay for a wall and all this other nonsense . I don ’ t think anybody ’ s done an effective job of pointing that out . Hopefully , we ’ ll have somebody like Americans for Prosperity and the Kochs who will step up to the plate and do it , ” he said .
But , he warned , there ’ s a risk to it . “ It could help Trump . It helps him say 'The establishment is against me . They ’ re out to get poor me . I ’ m the victim . ' ”","Some of the biggest Republican donors, who collectively have contributed tens of millions of dollars to shape the presidential race, are tightening their purse strings out of frustration with their inability to boost their favored candidates, or to slow Donald Trump.

They’re watching anxiously, hoping that the field sorts itself out, according to interviews with a half dozen major donors or their representatives.

Many of the donors are urging the deep-pocketed groups they’ve already funded to begin spending against Trump, even as some recognize the potential for such spending to backfire, and are increasingly questioning the efficacy of big-money advertising campaigns more generally.

“It’s unbelievable. I mean Jeb Bush spent $42 million in New Hampshire ― what did he get for it?” said billionaire GOP mega-donor Stan Hubbard, a Minnesota media mogul. “It’s frustrating.”

Hubbard and his family initially supported Scott Walker’s now-aborted campaign for the GOP nomination, donating more than $105,000 to the various committees supporting the Wisconsin governor. He was seen as a leading contender to unite the party’s conservative and business-centrist factions, but he never caught on, despite $24 million in super PAC support.

After Walker dropped out, the Hubbards played the GOP presidential field a bit, donating nearly $40,000 to committees supporting Bush, Marco Rubio and Ben Carson, as well as the since-aborted campaigns of Carly Fiorina and Chris Christie.

“That’s money down the drain,” Hubbard told POLITICO, adding that his latest hope to take down Trump is John Kasich. Hubbard and his wife each gave the maximum $2,700 contribution to the Ohio governor’s campaign for the nomination after he came in second in Tuesday’s New Hampshire’s primary. While Kasich finished well behind Trump, the showing was enough to attract interest from a handful of mega-donors who had previously supported other GOP candidates.

Home Depot founder Ken Langone, who previously had donated $250,000 to a super PAC supporting Christie, declared his support for Kasich and began calling other mega-donors, including Hubbard, to make the pitch.

“Guess what, Ken? You and I are on the same page,” Hubbard said he told Langone. “We just did the same thing ― sent money to Kasich.” But Hubbard said he planned to wait to see how Kasich did in the upcoming primaries before writing a check to his super PAC — and fundraising sources said that’s the way that many free agent GOP mega-donors are approaching the tumultuous primary.

“Most donors are sitting tight not knowing what to do,” said one top GOP fundraiser.

Rubio was close to coalescing support from the elite donor class, the fundraiser said, until his widely panned debate performance in New Hampshire primary and subsequent fifth-place finish in the state’s primary. “If he had finished second in New Hampshire or even a really close third, it would be a three-man race between Trump, Cruz and Rubio,” said the fundraiser. “If Rubio pulls it back together and gets on a minor roll in South Carolina, I think he can relatively quickly come back. Not because there’s such a deep loyalty to him from donors, but because they are so worried and desperately want someone to step forward to take on Trump.”

Several donors expressed frustration that the establishment candidates and the super PACs supporting them spent considerable time and money attacking one another ― and not Trump ― in the run-up to the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary.

Perhaps as a result, many donors who supported candidates who have since dropped out appear inclined to wait until after the Feb. 20 South Carolina primary to pick a new horse.

Wisconsin roofing billionaire Diane Hendricks, who gave $5 million to a pro-Walker super PAC and is being hotly courted by supporters of both Rubio and Ted Cruz, intends to wait until the cluster of primaries and caucuses on March 1 ― Super Tuesday ― before backing another candidate, said sources familiar with her plans.

Wyoming mutual fund pioneer Foster Friess, who supported Rick Santorum, this week told POLITICO ― presumably with tongue planted in cheek ― “I am still in the fetal position in my bed where I probably will be for the next 30 days after Rick's decision to drop out.”

He added on a more serious note that he’s not interested in backing candidates or groups training their fire on GOP rivals. “I want to try to play a conciliatory role. For us to win in November, all of these warring factions must kiss and make up,” Friess said. “I have huge respect for the efforts all the candidates are extending, but only wish they would direct their attacks toward the goofy Democrat ideas rather than a circular firing squad.”

Arkansas poultry magnate Ronnie Cameron, who donated $3 million to a super PAC supporting former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee’s since-aborted presidential campaign, said he had no immediate plans to give to any of them. “Maybe after South Carolina,” Cameron told POLITICO, though he added he “may not do anything else” with super PACs for the rest of the cycle.

GOP mega-donor John Jordan, who decided to support Rubio after Walker ― his first choice ― dropped out, predicted that one of the remaining establishment candidates would emerge from the pack on March 15, when a handful of delegate-rich states hold primaries.

“One of them will do better than the other, and it will be impossible for the relative loser to make the case to donors that he should continue,"" he told the Associated Press. Pointing specifically to Bush and Rubio ― the former governor and current senator, respectively, from Florida, which is among the March 15 states ― he said ""donors will simply move to whoever wins that state, and it will happen nearly instantly.”

But some donors worry that, by then, Trump might be unbeatable.

They’re looking for one of the existing deep-pocketed outside groups to take action sooner to halt Trump’s rise, with several donors specifically citing the political operation helmed by the billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch.

At its winter gathering of major donors a couple weeks ago in Indian Wells, Calif., operatives floated the possibility of launching an anti-Trump campaign, according to sources who attended. They said donors were mostly receptive. The Koch network, which intends to spend $889 million on policy and political advocacy in the run-up to the 2016 election, hasn’t previously ventured aggressively into GOP primaries, and sources familiar with the network say there is an intensive debate about the timing and details of a possible anti-Trump campaign.

The Minnesota mega-donor Hubbard, who has donated hundreds of thousands to the Koch network over the years (including at least $50,000 last year), but did not attend the winter meeting, said he planned to call Koch operatives to make the case that they should intervene.

“It’s time to start educating,” he said. “It’s obvious that there is no way that we’re going to be able to make Mexico pay for a wall and all this other nonsense. I don’t think anybody’s done an effective job of pointing that out. Hopefully, we’ll have somebody like Americans for Prosperity and the Kochs who will step up to the plate and do it,” he said.

But, he warned, there’s a risk to it. “It could help Trump. It helps him say 'The establishment is against me. They’re out to get poor me. I’m the victim.'”",www.politico.com,left,ZQFMNYyQqNWlNRKk

The striking disparity underscores two realities of the emerging race for control of the Senate in 2016.

Time
WASHINGTON — A group tied to billionaire Charles Koch has unleashed an aggressive campaign to kill a ballot measure in South Dakota that would require Koch-affiliated groups and others like them to reveal their donors ’ identities — part of a sustained effort by his powerful network to keep government agencies and the public from learning more about its financial backers .
Americans for Prosperity , the largest activist group in the policy and political empire founded by industrialist Koch and his brother , David , launched a coalition this year to fight Initiated Measure 22 , which calls for public disclosure of donors who fund advocacy efforts , the creation of a state ethics commission and public financing of political campaigns . It also limits lobbyists ' gifts to elected officials and lowers the amount of campaign contributions to candidates , parties and political action committees .
The AFP-founded coalition , called Defeat 22 , already has run commercials on talk radio and country-music stations , contacted 50,000 voters through phone calls and door-knocking and distributed mailers denouncing the initiative as a money-grab by politicians because it would give voters taxpayer-funded vouchers to help finance candidates ' campaigns , according to Ben Lee , the state director of Americans for Prosperity and chairman of Defeat 22 .
Luke Hilgemann , Americans for Prosperity ’ s national CEO , cast the South Dakota fight as a battle to protect donors ’ free-speech rights . Politicians who have been targeted by AFP over taxes and other policy issues over the years now want to unmask contributors ’ identities “ because they don ’ t like us bringing these issues to light and holding them accountable , ” he said .
He argued that revealing donors ’ identities could subject them to threats and intimidation and drive them away from funding advocacy groups .
“ The chilling of public discourse is a bad path for the country to go on , ” he said .
The South Dakota campaign marks the latest in a string of battles the Koch network has waged around the country to block efforts to disclose contributors ’ identities . Last year , for instance , AFP and more than a dozen other groups opposed a bill in Georgia that would have required advocacy groups active in state politics to disclose the sources of their money . The measure died .
In June , the House passed a Koch-supported bill that would bar the IRS from collecting the names of most donors to tax-exempt groups . Sen. Tim Scott , R-S.C. , has introduced a companion bill in the Senate . Earlier this year , Americans for Prosperity 's foundation won a federal trial to keep its donors secret in California .
The Koch network is one of the most influential groups in conservative politics . Some 700 like-minded donors each pledge to give least $ 100,000 annually to a mix of educational , policy and political organizations affiliated with the Kochs that push a small-government agenda . The network is on track to spend about $ 750 million during the 2016 election cycle , about a third of which will be directed to politics , officials say .
A large share of the network 's money flows through nonprofits whose donors are anonymous .
Koch officials say preserving “ free speech ” is among their top priorities in the coming years . “ Wherever there are threats against the First Amendment , we will be there to weigh in , ” Hilgemann said .
The South Dakota measure would not bar donations to nonprofit groups active in politics , but it would require the groups running independent ads and distributing mailers to disclose the identities of anyone who gives more than $ 100 in a calendar year .
Hilgemann would not disclose how much AFP is spending on the South Dakota effort . The coalition there includes the state ’ s chamber of commerce and the farm bureau , along with groups representing building contractors and retailers .
On the other side : Massachusetts-based Represent.Us , which is waging bipartisan campaigns around the country to end anonymous contributions in politics and pass laws it says will curb public corruption .
Represent.Us and other advocacy groups helped successfully pass similar measures in Seattle and Maine last year . In addition to South Dakota , two more initiatives that deal with either campaign finance or lobbying issues are headed to voters this fall , in San Francisco and Washington state .
Both sides view South Dakota as an important test in a year when voter anger about the role of moneyed interests in politics helped buoy the White House candidacies of Vermont Sen.

WASHINGTON — A group tied to billionaire Charles Koch has unleashed an aggressive campaign to kill a ballot measure in South Dakota that would require Koch-affiliated groups and others like them to reveal their donors’ identities — part of a sustained effort by his powerful network to keep government agencies and the public from learning more about its financial backers.

Americans for Prosperity, the largest activist group in the policy and political empire founded by industrialist Koch and his brother, David, launched a coalition this year to fight Initiated Measure 22, which calls for public disclosure of donors who fund advocacy efforts, the creation of a state ethics commission and public financing of political campaigns. It also limits lobbyists' gifts to elected officials and lowers the amount of campaign contributions to candidates, parties and political action committees.

South Dakota voters will decide the issue in November.

The AFP-founded coalition, called Defeat 22, already has run commercials on talk radio and country-music stations, contacted 50,000 voters through phone calls and door-knocking and distributed mailers denouncing the initiative as a money-grab by politicians because it would give voters taxpayer-funded vouchers to help finance candidates' campaigns, according to Ben Lee, the state director of Americans for Prosperity and chairman of Defeat 22.

Luke Hilgemann, Americans for Prosperity’s national CEO, cast the South Dakota fight as a battle to protect donors’ free-speech rights. Politicians who have been targeted by AFP over taxes and other policy issues over the years now want to unmask contributors’ identities “because they don’t like us bringing these issues to light and holding them accountable,” he said.

He argued that revealing donors’ identities could subject them to threats and intimidation and drive them away from funding advocacy groups.

“The chilling of public discourse is a bad path for the country to go on,” he said.

The South Dakota campaign marks the latest in a string of battles the Koch network has waged around the country to block efforts to disclose contributors’ identities. Last year, for instance, AFP and more than a dozen other groups opposed a bill in Georgia that would have required advocacy groups active in state politics to disclose the sources of their money. The measure died.

In June, the House passed a Koch-supported bill that would bar the IRS from collecting the names of most donors to tax-exempt groups. Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., has introduced a companion bill in the Senate. Earlier this year, Americans for Prosperity's foundation won a federal trial to keep its donors secret in California.

The Koch network is one of the most influential groups in conservative politics. Some 700 like-minded donors each pledge to give least $100,000 annually to a mix of educational, policy and political organizations affiliated with the Kochs that push a small-government agenda. The network is on track to spend about $750 million during the 2016 election cycle, about a third of which will be directed to politics, officials say.

A large share of the network's money flows through nonprofits whose donors are anonymous.

Koch officials say preserving “free speech” is among their top priorities in the coming years. “Wherever there are threats against the First Amendment, we will be there to weigh in,” Hilgemann said.

The South Dakota measure would not bar donations to nonprofit groups active in politics, but it would require the groups running independent ads and distributing mailers to disclose the identities of anyone who gives more than $100 in a calendar year.

Hilgemann would not disclose how much AFP is spending on the South Dakota effort. The coalition there includes the state’s chamber of commerce and the farm bureau, along with groups representing building contractors and retailers.

On the other side: Massachusetts-based Represent.Us, which is waging bipartisan campaigns around the country to end anonymous contributions in politics and pass laws it says will curb public corruption.

Represent.Us and other advocacy groups helped successfully pass similar measures in Seattle and Maine last year. In addition to South Dakota, two more initiatives that deal with either campaign finance or lobbying issues are headed to voters this fall, in San Francisco and Washington state.

Both sides view South Dakota as an important test in a year when voter anger about the role of moneyed interests in politics helped buoy the White House candidacies of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and the Republican nominee Donald Trump. Republicans control the governors’ mansion in South Dakota and both houses of the state legislature. A former GOP state senator, Don Frankenfeld, is helping run the “Yes 22” campaign in the state.

“If it can happen in South Dakota, it can happen in 10 or 20 other states,” Hilgemann said.

The early spending against the measure caught organizers by surprise, Frankenfeld said. “We’re scrambling now to mount an appropriate response to the misleading charge that it’s a raid on the treasury for politicians.”

Defeat 22 has targeted a provision in the ballot measure that would give two, $50 “democracy credits” to every registered voter in the South Dakota. Candidates then could redeem those vouchers for taxpayer-funded money for their elections.

The measure would cap the voucher program at $12 million, and candidates could not receive unlimited amounts from the state treasury. For instance, a legislative candidate would face a $15,000-limit on voucher funds.

Defeat 22’s literature says the initiative would let politicians spend taxpayer money on TV ads and robocalls “instead of funding better roads and schools” and urged voters to “keep politics out of our pockets.”

The initiative's supporters say their internal polling shows strong support for the measure, which comes in the wake of a high-profile corruption investigation into state management of the federal EB-5 program, which grants green cards to wealthy foreigners who invest in South Dakota projects. A former state official has been charged in connection with the probe and a former cabinet official, who was under investigation, committed suicide in 2013.

Frankenfeld said his side has spent about $360,000, much of it focused on getting the initiative on the ballot. “Will we be outspent by the Koch brothers? Probably.”

“I’m optimistic about the outcome,” he said. “The Koch brothers have gotten our attention, but I’m confident we’ve got the better argument.”

A record-breaking fundraising spree by Barack Obama has seen him make 30 separate visits to wealthy donors since April , according to a Guardian investigation into campaign finance trips that are running at more than twice the rate of the president 's two-term predecessors .
Although unable to run again for election himself , Obama is estimated to have raised up to $ 40m for other Democrats since his last inauguration in January as he devotes a growing portion of the second term to financing efforts aimed at winning back control of Congress in next year 's midterm elections .
Travelling to the 30 fundraisers , mostly held in private mansions and luxury hotels across 10 cities , has also required him to clock up more than 20,000 miles on Air Force One at an estimated cost to the US taxpayer of more than $ 6m .
In contrast , ███ research reveals presidents of both parties previously averaged only 13 fundraisers in the equivalent period of their second terms . George W Bush attended just 11 similar events , Bill Clinton managed 18 and Ronald Reagan only 10 .
The data was collated from 2013 White House pool reports , new research assisted by the Clinton and Reagan presidential libraries , and a tally of the Bush years collated by veteran CBS reporter Mark Knoller .
Donors typically pay up to a legal limit of $ 32,400 to attend private dinners and drinks receptions with the president , usually in the home of a wealthy benefactor . Party officials declined to disclose overall totals raised in this way , but ticket prices and numbers of attendees are often revealed at the time , indicating a maximum of $ 41m may have been gathered through Obama 's presence since April , according to Guardian estimates .
The money has been split roughly evenly between the Democratic congressional campaign committee ( DCCC ) , the Democratic senatorial campaign committee ( DSCC ) , and the Democratic national committee ( DNC ) , which supports a mix of party campaigns .
Last Friday , for example , Obama , after attending a public event in New Orleans , flew to Miami to attend three fundraisers for the DNC and the DSCC . These included a speech beside the palm trees and swimming pool of wealthy Cuban American businessman Jose Mas Santos , and another poolside event to support Florida senator Bill Nelson . On Thursday , Obama flies to Philadelphia for his 31st fundraiser of the year , also for the DSCC .
Democratic party officials defended Obama 's fundraising spree , and blamed Republican intransigence in Congress for driving it .
`` House Republicans ' reckless and irresponsible agenda is not only driving their approval ratings to record lows – it 's boosting our fundraising to record highs , '' said DCCC spokeswoman Emily Bittner .
`` President Obama has been a tremendous asset in DCCC fundraising this cycle , and that 's because our donors want to make sure that he has a partner in Congress who will work with him to solve problems , instead of blocking commonsense solutions for purely partisan political reasons . ''
Campaign finance experts say the unprecedented burst of presidential solicitation during a non-election year reveals how fundraising has become a dangerously permanent feature of modern political life .
Second terms were once a respite from the need to seek re-election finance , but are increasingly dominated by party fundraising in the first and second years , followed by a search for donations toward presidential libraries in the final two years of office .
Jessica Levinson , a campaign finance researcher at Loyola Law School who has studied the growing influence of wealthy donors , says recent efforts in the supreme court to remove campaign finance limits for individuals are likely to exacerbate the trend .
`` The downside of all this time spent away from office is the time the president is not doing his job as chief executive , promoting legislation or working with Congress , '' she said .
`` As more money is dropped into the political process it has become a self-perpetuating cycle , requiring politicians to spend ever more time seeking donations rather than governing . It 's an imperfect use of his time . ''
Obama has been heavily criticised in recent weeks for not paying enough attention to crises such as the launch of his flagship health insurance website or the surveillance activities of the National Security Agency , and several of the trips have clashed with key moments in both sagas .
But the office of president also provides enviable logistical support for such efforts , allowing Obama to travel , for example , from Washington to fundraising events in both Boston and Miami and back on one day in June .

''","Obama has made 30 separate fundraising trips since April – more than twice the rate of his two-term predecessors – in bid to help Democrats win in 2014 midterm elections

A record-breaking fundraising spree by Barack Obama has seen him make 30 separate visits to wealthy donors since April, according to a Guardian investigation into campaign finance trips that are running at more than twice the rate of the president's two-term predecessors.

Although unable to run again for election himself, Obama is estimated to have raised up to $40m for other Democrats since his last inauguration in January as he devotes a growing portion of the second term to financing efforts aimed at winning back control of Congress in next year's midterm elections.

Travelling to the 30 fundraisers, mostly held in private mansions and luxury hotels across 10 cities, has also required him to clock up more than 20,000 miles on Air Force One at an estimated cost to the US taxpayer of more than $6m.

In contrast, the Guardian research reveals presidents of both parties previously averaged only 13 fundraisers in the equivalent period of their second terms. George W Bush attended just 11 similar events, Bill Clinton managed 18 and Ronald Reagan only 10.

The data was collated from 2013 White House pool reports, new research assisted by the Clinton and Reagan presidential libraries, and a tally of the Bush years collated by veteran CBS reporter Mark Knoller.

Donors typically pay up to a legal limit of $32,400 to attend private dinners and drinks receptions with the president, usually in the home of a wealthy benefactor. Party officials declined to disclose overall totals raised in this way, but ticket prices and numbers of attendees are often revealed at the time, indicating a maximum of $41m may have been gathered through Obama's presence since April, according to Guardian estimates.

The money has been split roughly evenly between the Democratic congressional campaign committee (DCCC), the Democratic senatorial campaign committee (DSCC), and the Democratic national committee (DNC), which supports a mix of party campaigns.

Last Friday, for example, Obama, after attending a public event in New Orleans, flew to Miami to attend three fundraisers for the DNC and the DSCC. These included a speech beside the palm trees and swimming pool of wealthy Cuban American businessman Jose Mas Santos, and another poolside event to support Florida senator Bill Nelson. On Thursday, Obama flies to Philadelphia for his 31st fundraiser of the year, also for the DSCC.

Democratic party officials defended Obama's fundraising spree, and blamed Republican intransigence in Congress for driving it.

""House Republicans' reckless and irresponsible agenda is not only driving their approval ratings to record lows – it's boosting our fundraising to record highs,"" said DCCC spokeswoman Emily Bittner.

""President Obama has been a tremendous asset in DCCC fundraising this cycle, and that's because our donors want to make sure that he has a partner in Congress who will work with him to solve problems, instead of blocking commonsense solutions for purely partisan political reasons.""

Campaign finance experts say the unprecedented burst of presidential solicitation during a non-election year reveals how fundraising has become a dangerously permanent feature of modern political life.

Second terms were once a respite from the need to seek re-election finance, but are increasingly dominated by party fundraising in the first and second years, followed by a search for donations toward presidential libraries in the final two years of office.

Jessica Levinson, a campaign finance researcher at Loyola Law School who has studied the growing influence of wealthy donors, says recent efforts in the supreme court to remove campaign finance limits for individuals are likely to exacerbate the trend.

""The downside of all this time spent away from office is the time the president is not doing his job as chief executive, promoting legislation or working with Congress,"" she said.

""As more money is dropped into the political process it has become a self-perpetuating cycle, requiring politicians to spend ever more time seeking donations rather than governing. It's an imperfect use of his time.""

Obama has been heavily criticised in recent weeks for not paying enough attention to crises such as the launch of his flagship health insurance website or the surveillance activities of the National Security Agency, and several of the trips have clashed with key moments in both sagas.

But the office of president also provides enviable logistical support for such efforts, allowing Obama to travel, for example, from Washington to fundraising events in both Boston and Miami and back on one day in June. Using Air Force One is required for security reasons and often justified by other public speaking engagements on the same trip, but every hour in the air costs $180,000.

""Every president does this,"" said Kathy Kiely of the Sunlight Foundation, a Washington transparency group. ""But it's pretty obvious that a lot of these public speaking events are tacked on to provide an excuse for him to be in town.""

On Wednesday, Washington Governor Jay Inslee officially dropped out of the presidential race, just days after John Hickenlooper also called it quits (and announced his Senate bid). As of June, both former candidates raised nearly $8.5 million in campaign contributions from individual donors and PACs.



Before September’s third round of debates in Houston, we’ll likely see at least a handful of other candidates also drop out, representing millions in campaign donations. But what exactly happens with your campaign contributions when a presidential candidate drops out of the race? Can they use your funds on fancy trips or private jets? According to rules set forth by the Federal Election Committee, any excess campaign funds are not allowed for personal use, but it’s entirely possible, and the world of campaign finance is needlessly complicated.

Excess funds can be used to cover expenses or spent on other candidates

Let’s say you’ve donated $25 to a candidate. If a campaign has any outstanding debt or expenses, part of your donation might be used to pay these off. This could mean paying salaries for campaign staff or even moving expenses.

If you’re supporting a campaign that hasn’t accrued any debt, it’s likely part of your $25 might be used for that candidate’s future campaigns—Hickenlooper, no doubt, will likely allocate any excess funds toward his Senate campaign.

Then there’s the grey area: Candidates also have the ability to use your donation to purchase “gifts,” so long as they are not given to the candidate’s family; what constitutes a “gift,” however, seems pretty open-ended.

As for less likely alternatives, a candidate might put your $25 toward a political action committee they support or just another candidate in a race (though they’d probably prefer to keep it). Your contribution could also be donated to charities at your candidate’s choosing.

In the end, the FEC’s rules are vague and candidates adhere to them in whatever way they see fit. All of this brings us to a big, glaring question—how can you be sure your donation has been used appropriately?

How to make sure your contributions are spent wisely (sort of)

While you can never be 100% sure how your individual donation is spent, you can research a campaign’s spending throughout and after a presidential bid is over. “Once a campaign has ended, a candidate’s committee must continue to file FEC reports until the committee is terminated,” a spokesperson for the FEC said on email. “So it’s possible to track how the campaigns spend any residual funds they maintain.”

To view these reports, visit the FEC database, search by a candidate’s campaign name—which typically consists of their last name, followed by “For America” or “2020""—and scroll to the bottom of the page to find their expenses. To find Inslee’s campaign, search for “Inslee for America.” To find Hickenlooper’s campaign, search for “Hickenlooper 2020.” You can search for any former presidential candidate’s campaign from any other election, as well.

There are limits to these filings. For one, they’re generally updated quarterly; if you donated to Inslee or Hickenlooper, you won’t know how they’re spending excess funds until September. Also, you’ll have to do a lot of digging into candidates’ expenses, and even then, you can’t fully interpret a simple line item.

But the drill was basically the same . The personal injury lawyers listened politely for a few minutes , then returned to their offices . And Tester walked away with $ 26,400 in checks .
Jon Tester didn ’ t come all the way from Montana for the scrambled eggs and bacon . The US senator , virtually unknown in Boston , was in a conference room at the Thornton Law Firm that June morning to cash in at one of the most reliable stops on the Democratic fund-raising circuit , a law firm that pours millions into the coffers of the party and its politicians .
But a striking thing happened the day Tester visited in 2010 . Partner David C. Strouss received a payment from the firm labeled as a “ bonus ” that exactly equaled his $ 2,400 contribution to Tester ’ s campaign , the maximum allowed . A few days later , partner Garrett Bradley — until recently the House assistant majority leader on Beacon Hill — got a bonus , too , exactly matching his $ 2,400 gift to Tester .
This pattern of payments — contributions offset by bonus payments — was commonplace at Thornton , according to a review of law firm records by the Spotlight Team and the Center for Responsive Politics , a Washington-based nonprofit that tracks campaign finance data .
From 2010 through 2014 , Strouss and Bradley , along with founding partner Michael Thornton and his wife , donated nearly $ 1.6 million to Democratic Party fund-raising committees and a parade of politicians — from Senate minority leader Harry Reid of Nevada to Hawaii gubernatorial candidate David Ige to Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts . Over the same span , the lawyers received $ 1.4 million listed as “ bonuses ” in Thornton Law Firm records ; more than 280 of the contributions precisely matched bonuses that were paid within 10 days .
That payback system , which involved other partners as well , helped make Thornton the 11th-ranked law firm nationally for political contributions in 2014 , according to data analyzed by the center , even though it is not among the 100 largest in Massachusetts .
Thornton , through a spokesman , said its donation reimbursement program was reviewed by outside lawyers and complied with applicable laws . Campaign finance experts said that without reviewing the firm ’ s records , they can not say the payback system breaks the law , but that it raises numerous red flags .
That ’ s because reimbursing people for their political donations is generally illegal , several experts said . When political donors are repaid for their donations , it can conceal the real source of contributions , and enable the unnamed source of the funds to exceed state and federal contribution limits . And in some states — Massachusetts among them — political donations to state candidates from corporations and partnerships such as Thornton Law Firm are flatly illegal .
Reimbursing donors is “ among the most serious campaign violations , in the view of both the Federal Election Commission and the Department of Justice , ” said Daniel Petalas , an attorney who served as acting general counsel of the FEC until September .
US Senator Jon Tester came to Boston for a fund-raiser in 2010 . He raised $ 26,400 . That same day , Thornton Law Firm partner David C. Strouss received a $ 2,400 bonus — it equaled his contribution to Tester . Michael Albans/Associated Press/File 2012
“ Using straw donors to make contributions is illegal , ” said Larry Noble , general counsel of the Washington-based Campaign Legal Center and a former general counsel of the FEC . “ People can go and have gone to prison for this . ”
Thornton officials declined to comment , instead hiring a former federal prosecutor to respond to the Globe ’ s questions .
The ex-prosecutor , Brian Kelly , said the bonuses should not have been called bonuses at all because they were paid from the lawyers ’ own money . He said an accountant deducted the payments from their equity , or ownership , in the firm . When lawyers leave Thornton Law and cash in their equity , he said , their financial settlement with Thornton would be reduced by the amount of the bonuses .
Kelly provided a written statement from Michael Thornton saying that “ an error made internally ” led to the payments being called bonuses . Thornton said he changed the way they were labeled in 2015 , several years into the program , when he discovered the mistake .
“ It ’ s obviously not a crime to make lots of donations to politicians , and they certainly did that , ” said Kelly . “ But their donation program was vetted by prior counsel and an outside accountant , and the firm made every effort to comply with all applicable laws and regulations . ”
However , campaign finance experts were skeptical about the system Kelly describes , saying it could allow partners to go years before repaying the firm for the bonuses . Regulators could view the bonuses as open-ended loans , they said , making them hidden , illegal donations from the firm .
“ I think they need to be very careful , ” said James Kahl , former deputy general counsel of the FEC . “ The big red flag is monies being advanced , and the truing up doesn ’ t happen for many years . ”
Kelly , who has given varying explanations of the reimbursement policy since first being asked about it in July , declined to provide a copy of a legal opinion that he said justified the repayment program . He also declined to say whether lawyers who left the firm were required to pay when the bonuses they received exceeded their equity in the firm .
But one thing is certain : The policy was so complicated that some lawyers at the firm didn ’ t understand it , said former employees . They were just happy to get their money back .
Michael Thornton , a former Marine who served in Vietnam , made his name in the law by becoming a national leader in handling asbestos-related cases , especially those in which victims developed mesothelioma , a deadly cancer caused by asbestos exposure . Thornton lawyers have handled thousands of such cases , made millions of dollars , and even helped to underwrite research into mesothelioma .
But that pipeline of profits was threatened just over a decade ago when some leading politicians , including President George W. Bush , moved to limit damages in class action lawsuits and to allow the victims of asbestos exposure to file their claims for compensation directly to a national trust fund — bypassing lawyers who typically receive a third of any award .
The firm ’ s partners contributed heavily to mostly Democratic politicians who , they hoped , would thwart efforts to create the trust fund .
“ If it passed , the firm would close , ” said a former employee who feared retaliation if his name were used . “ Hence , the beginning of the political donations . ”
They gave more and more each year , from $ 257,300 to federal candidates and the Democratic Party in the 2003-2004 election cycle to nearly $ 1.1 million a decade later , according to the center — quadrupling their contributions .
Thornton is a small firm — usually 10 or fewer equity partners — but the lawyers punch well above their weight in political fund-raising .
In the two-year election cycle ending in 2014 , for example , lawyers at Thornton Naumes , as the firm was then called , donated more than much larger multinational firms such as Greenberg Traurig , a Miami-based law firm that claims 38 offices and 2,000 attorneys .
Over three election cycles — 2010 , 2012 , and 2014 — Thornton partners contributed more than $ 3.4 million to candidates and the party nationwide , especially Democratic Senate candidates who opposed overhauling the asbestos litigation system .
Just one Republican senator has collected contributions from Thornton ’ s lawyers . Lindsey Graham , an idiosyncratic South Carolinian and former trial lawyer , received $ 62,800 over the last decade . Graham helped peel away enough GOP support in the Senate to ensure the trust fund bill ’ s death on Valentine ’ s Day 2006 , according to former Senate aides .
Thornton ’ s lawyers were especially generous to Vice President Joe Biden , one of Washington ’ s strongest advocates for trial lawyers , contributing more than $ 78,000 to his campaigns from 2003 to 2008 .
During President Obama and Biden ’ s reelection campaign in 2012 , Michael Thornton hosted a fund-raiser for the Obama Victory Fund at his house in Cambridge , where Biden was the guest of honor . Some of the biggest donors — some Thornton partners gave $ 20,000 — were escorted into a private room and offered the chance to be photographed with Biden , said someone who was there . Thornton records show the lawyers were reimbursed for those donations .
Thornton declined to speak to the Globe , but he has been vocal about his support for Biden , who , as a senator , once chaired the Judiciary Committee , and twice helped block legislation that would have established the asbestos trust fund .
“ Senator Biden has been a trial-lawyer advocate for many terms in the Senate , ” Thornton was quoted as saying in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch in 2008 . “ We represent victims ; we think it ’ s in the best interest of our clients if they have an opportunity to go to court . Senator Biden agrees . ”
Once Michael Thornton ’ s willingness to raise large amounts of money became known among lawyers and politicians , the American Association for Justice , the trial lawyers ’ Washington-based lobbying group , increasingly turned to the firm ’ s lawyers for help , even for little-known candidates running in states far from Boston .
“ At first it happened every three or four months , and then it was sometimes three or four times each month , ” even though the threat of asbestos litigation reform had faded , said the former employee who requested anonymity .
As the number of fund-raisers started piling up , partners began to grouse . Even though Thornton called the contributions “ voluntary , ” partners felt pressured to give , according to the former employee . After all , Michael Thornton was the firm ’ s lead partner , with enormous sway over what the other partners were paid .
So , according to three former employees , Thornton Law Firm adopted the donation reimbursement system .
Bonus checks that were reviewed by the Globe made clear that the payments were for political donations , with notations giving the name of the politician the partner had donated to .
The Globe and the Center for Responsive Politics reviewed records covering payments to three senior partners — Thornton , Bradley , and Strouss — who are among the top shareholders in the firm . Then the Globe and the center matched the bonuses against federal , state , and local campaign records .
Campaign contribution and law firm records from 2010 through 2014 show that Thornton donated the most , and the firm gave him bonuses that matched not only his donations , but at least 33 made by his wife , Amy , who runs an investment fund . The couple donated just over $ 1 million between 2010 and 2014 , and Thornton received $ 862,450 in offsetting bonuses .
Michael Thornton , through a spokesman , denied the law firm reimbursed his wife ’ s donations .
Bradley made donations of $ 340,535 and received almost as much in bonuses — $ 339,000 over that period , the records shows .
Strouss gave $ 205,150 over the five years and received almost the same amount in bonuses — $ 197,150 .
By donating as individuals , lawyers for the firm were able to collectively give far more to individual candidates in a single year than the firm could have donated directly under federal law .
Over a 10-day period in 2013 , for example , Thornton partners gave $ 52,000 to Senator Chuck Schumer of New York , a subcommittee chairman on the Senate Judiciary Committee — 20 times as much as the $ 2,600 that the partnership itself could have donated . ( Corporate contributions are illegal under federal law , but partnership contributions are not . )
In 2012 , the lawyers gave Warren $ 42,200 , 16 times as much as the firm could have given her directly .

Thornton lawyers also donated more than $ 260,000 to state and local politicians in Massachusetts from 2010 to 2014 .
If those donations were determined to have actually been made by the firm — because the lawyers were reimbursed — they would be illegal , since political contributions from corporations or partnerships are prohibited in Massachusetts .
There ’ s no indication that any of the politicians who received Thornton donations knew anything about the law firm ’ s questionable reimbursement system .
The FEC does allow partners in a law firm to donate to political campaigns , but only if the funds clearly come from the partner ’ s own money . According to FEC rules , a partnership can contribute on behalf of its partners , but then must promptly deduct the amount of the donation from the next profit-sharing payments to the partners , called “ partnership distributions . ”
Brian Kelly , Thornton ’ s outside counsel , said the firm ’ s practice is legal because , at the end of each quarter , the firm ’ s accountant deducts the political donations from something called the “ capital account ” of each partner with the firm .
The capital account is a way for the accountant to keep track of the partners ’ share of equity in the firm . The deductions from the capital account are on paper only , Kelly acknowledged . When partners leave the firm , they may be entitled to a payment from the capital account that Kelly says is reduced by the amount of reimbursements received .
But reimbursing partners out of their equity in the firm — as Kelly said Thornton did — is likely illegal , said Brett Kappel , a Washington lawyer who specializes in campaign finance .
“ If they were legitimate contributions , they should have been deducted from their partnership distributions , ” Kappel said .
Bradley , the senior partner , abruptly resigned his position as assistant majority leader in the state House of Representatives on June 27 after the Globe had begun asking questions about his firm ’ s business practices .
His decision stunned colleagues , coming so late in the election cycle that there was no time to take his name off the November ballot .
Bradley explained at the time that Michael Thornton was retiring and that he , Bradley , was being promoted to managing partner of his law firm . As a result , he wanted to focus on his legal work . Thornton is now chairman of the firm .
“ I wouldn ’ t have the time to do this [ legislative ] job the way it should be done ” because of the promotion , Bradley explained to the State House News Service . “ It ’ s bittersweet for me . ”
Some campaign finance experts say they expect Thornton ’ s reimbursement system is likely to raise suspicions among regulators and law enforcement officials alike .
“ The use of the word ‘ bonus ’ for these payments , combined with the fact that they so closely matched the amounts and timing of the donations , would certainly capture the attention of the general counsel ’ s office at the FEC— and given how much was involved , the public integrity section at the Department of Justice , ” said Kappel , the Washington campaign finance lawyer .
The Globe and the center could not find another law firm that used a similar reimbursement system . Thornton itself stopped the reimbursements when the Globe and the center began asking about it .
“ I ’ ve been a partner at two law firms and have made many political donations , ” said Leonard Kesten , a partner at Brody , Hardoon , Perkins and Kesten in Boston . “ But I ’ ve never seen anything like this . It seems very peculiar . ”
Meanwhile , in the Senate , measures to change the asbestos litigation system continue to pop up .
This year , the Furthering Asbestos Claim Transparency Act passed the House , but ran into opposition from Schumer , the New York senator who was a top recipient of Thornton donations .","Tester, a massive, jovial man who raises livestock on his family farm, was more compelling than many of the other breakfast guests, all of them political candidates the firm hoped would defend the interests of trial attorneys. But the drill was basically the same. The personal injury lawyers listened politely for a few minutes, then returned to their offices. And Tester walked away with $26,400 in checks.

Jon Tester didn’t come all the way from Montana for the scrambled eggs and bacon. The US senator, virtually unknown in Boston, was in a conference room at the Thornton Law Firm that June morning to cash in at one of the most reliable stops on the Democratic fund-raising circuit, a law firm that pours millions into the coffers of the party and its politicians.

But a striking thing happened the day Tester visited in 2010. Partner David C. Strouss received a payment from the firm labeled as a “bonus” that exactly equaled his $2,400 contribution to Tester’s campaign, the maximum allowed. A few days later, partner Garrett Bradley — until recently the House assistant majority leader on Beacon Hill — got a bonus, too, exactly matching his $2,400 gift to Tester.

This pattern of payments — contributions offset by bonus payments — was commonplace at Thornton, according to a review of law firm records by the Spotlight Team and the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based nonprofit that tracks campaign finance data.

From 2010 through 2014, Strouss and Bradley, along with founding partner Michael Thornton and his wife, donated nearly $1.6 million to Democratic Party fund-raising committees and a parade of politicians — from Senate minority leader Harry Reid of Nevada to Hawaii gubernatorial candidate David Ige to Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Over the same span, the lawyers received $1.4 million listed as “bonuses” in Thornton Law Firm records; more than 280 of the contributions precisely matched bonuses that were paid within 10 days.

That payback system, which involved other partners as well, helped make Thornton the 11th-ranked law firm nationally for political contributions in 2014, according to data analyzed by the center, even though it is not among the 100 largest in Massachusetts.

Thornton, through a spokesman, said its donation reimbursement program was reviewed by outside lawyers and complied with applicable laws. Campaign finance experts said that without reviewing the firm’s records, they cannot say the payback system breaks the law, but that it raises numerous red flags.

That’s because reimbursing people for their political donations is generally illegal, several experts said. When political donors are repaid for their donations, it can conceal the real source of contributions, and enable the unnamed source of the funds to exceed state and federal contribution limits. And in some states — Massachusetts among them — political donations to state candidates from corporations and partnerships such as Thornton Law Firm are flatly illegal.

Reimbursing donors is “among the most serious campaign violations, in the view of both the Federal Election Commission and the Department of Justice,” said Daniel Petalas, an attorney who served as acting general counsel of the FEC until September.

“Using straw donors to make contributions is illegal,” said Larry Noble, general counsel of the Washington-based Campaign Legal Center and a former general counsel of the FEC. “People can go and have gone to prison for this.”

Thornton officials declined to comment, instead hiring a former federal prosecutor to respond to the Globe’s questions.

The ex-prosecutor, Brian Kelly, said the bonuses should not have been called bonuses at all because they were paid from the lawyers’ own money. He said an accountant deducted the payments from their equity, or ownership, in the firm. When lawyers leave Thornton Law and cash in their equity, he said, their financial settlement with Thornton would be reduced by the amount of the bonuses.

Kelly provided a written statement from Michael Thornton saying that “an error made internally” led to the payments being called bonuses. Thornton said he changed the way they were labeled in 2015, several years into the program, when he discovered the mistake.

“It’s obviously not a crime to make lots of donations to politicians, and they certainly did that,” said Kelly. “But their donation program was vetted by prior counsel and an outside accountant, and the firm made every effort to comply with all applicable laws and regulations.”

However, campaign finance experts were skeptical about the system Kelly describes, saying it could allow partners to go years before repaying the firm for the bonuses. Regulators could view the bonuses as open-ended loans, they said, making them hidden, illegal donations from the firm.

“I think they need to be very careful,” said James Kahl, former deputy general counsel of the FEC. “The big red flag is monies being advanced, and the truing up doesn’t happen for many years.”

Kelly, who has given varying explanations of the reimbursement policy since first being asked about it in July, declined to provide a copy of a legal opinion that he said justified the repayment program. He also declined to say whether lawyers who left the firm were required to pay when the bonuses they received exceeded their equity in the firm.

But one thing is certain: The policy was so complicated that some lawyers at the firm didn’t understand it, said former employees. They were just happy to get their money back.

Firm’s origins

Michael Thornton, a former Marine who served in Vietnam, made his name in the law by becoming a national leader in handling asbestos-related cases, especially those in which victims developed mesothelioma, a deadly cancer caused by asbestos exposure. Thornton lawyers have handled thousands of such cases, made millions of dollars, and even helped to underwrite research into mesothelioma.

But that pipeline of profits was threatened just over a decade ago when some leading politicians, including President George W. Bush, moved to limit damages in class action lawsuits and to allow the victims of asbestos exposure to file their claims for compensation directly to a national trust fund — bypassing lawyers who typically receive a third of any award.

That’s when Thornton learned the power of political donations.

The firm’s partners contributed heavily to mostly Democratic politicians who, they hoped, would thwart efforts to create the trust fund.

“If it passed, the firm would close,” said a former employee who feared retaliation if his name were used. “Hence, the beginning of the political donations.”

They gave more and more each year, from $257,300 to federal candidates and the Democratic Party in the 2003-2004 election cycle to nearly $1.1 million a decade later, according to the center — quadrupling their contributions.

Thornton is a small firm — usually 10 or fewer equity partners — but the lawyers punch well above their weight in political fund-raising.

In the two-year election cycle ending in 2014, for example, lawyers at Thornton Naumes, as the firm was then called, donated more than much larger multinational firms such as Greenberg Traurig, a Miami-based law firm that claims 38 offices and 2,000 attorneys.

Over three election cycles — 2010, 2012, and 2014 — Thornton partners contributed more than $3.4 million to candidates and the party nationwide, especially Democratic Senate candidates who opposed overhauling the asbestos litigation system.

Just one Republican senator has collected contributions from Thornton’s lawyers. Lindsey Graham, an idiosyncratic South Carolinian and former trial lawyer, received $62,800 over the last decade. Graham helped peel away enough GOP support in the Senate to ensure the trust fund bill’s death on Valentine’s Day 2006, according to former Senate aides.

Thornton’s lawyers were especially generous to Vice President Joe Biden, one of Washington’s strongest advocates for trial lawyers, contributing more than $78,000 to his campaigns from 2003 to 2008.

During President Obama and Biden’s reelection campaign in 2012, Michael Thornton hosted a fund-raiser for the Obama Victory Fund at his house in Cambridge, where Biden was the guest of honor. Some of the biggest donors — some Thornton partners gave $20,000 — were escorted into a private room and offered the chance to be photographed with Biden, said someone who was there. Thornton records show the lawyers were reimbursed for those donations.

Thornton declined to speak to the Globe, but he has been vocal about his support for Biden, who, as a senator, once chaired the Judiciary Committee, and twice helped block legislation that would have established the asbestos trust fund.

“Senator Biden has been a trial-lawyer advocate for many terms in the Senate,” Thornton was quoted as saying in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch in 2008. “We represent victims; we think it’s in the best interest of our clients if they have an opportunity to go to court. Senator Biden agrees.”

Once Michael Thornton’s willingness to raise large amounts of money became known among lawyers and politicians, the American Association for Justice, the trial lawyers’ Washington-based lobbying group, increasingly turned to the firm’s lawyers for help, even for little-known candidates running in states far from Boston.

“At first it happened every three or four months, and then it was sometimes three or four times each month,” even though the threat of asbestos litigation reform had faded, said the former employee who requested anonymity.

As the number of fund-raisers started piling up, partners began to grouse. Even though Thornton called the contributions “voluntary,” partners felt pressured to give, according to the former employee. After all, Michael Thornton was the firm’s lead partner, with enormous sway over what the other partners were paid.

So, according to three former employees, Thornton Law Firm adopted the donation reimbursement system.

Bonus checks that were reviewed by the Globe made clear that the payments were for political donations, with notations giving the name of the politician the partner had donated to.

The Globe and the Center for Responsive Politics reviewed records covering payments to three senior partners — Thornton, Bradley, and Strouss — who are among the top shareholders in the firm. Then the Globe and the center matched the bonuses against federal, state, and local campaign records.

Campaign contribution and law firm records from 2010 through 2014 show that Thornton donated the most, and the firm gave him bonuses that matched not only his donations, but at least 33 made by his wife, Amy, who runs an investment fund. The couple donated just over $1 million between 2010 and 2014, and Thornton received $862,450 in offsetting bonuses.

Michael Thornton, through a spokesman, denied the law firm reimbursed his wife’s donations.

Bradley made donations of $340,535 and received almost as much in bonuses — $339,000 over that period, the records shows.

Strouss gave $205,150 over the five years and received almost the same amount in bonuses — $197,150.

By donating as individuals, lawyers for the firm were able to collectively give far more to individual candidates in a single year than the firm could have donated directly under federal law.

Over a 10-day period in 2013, for example, Thornton partners gave $52,000 to Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, a subcommittee chairman on the Senate Judiciary Committee — 20 times as much as the $2,600 that the partnership itself could have donated. (Corporate contributions are illegal under federal law, but partnership contributions are not.)

In 2012, the lawyers gave Warren $42,200, 16 times as much as the firm could have given her directly.

Thornton lawyers also donated more than $260,000 to state and local politicians in Massachusetts from 2010 to 2014.

If those donations were determined to have actually been made by the firm — because the lawyers were reimbursed — they would be illegal, since political contributions from corporations or partnerships are prohibited in Massachusetts.

There’s no indication that any of the politicians who received Thornton donations knew anything about the law firm’s questionable reimbursement system.

The FEC does allow partners in a law firm to donate to political campaigns, but only if the funds clearly come from the partner’s own money. According to FEC rules, a partnership can contribute on behalf of its partners, but then must promptly deduct the amount of the donation from the next profit-sharing payments to the partners, called “partnership distributions.”

That’s not what Thornton did.

Brian Kelly, Thornton’s outside counsel, said the firm’s practice is legal because, at the end of each quarter, the firm’s accountant deducts the political donations from something called the “capital account” of each partner with the firm.

The capital account is a way for the accountant to keep track of the partners’ share of equity in the firm. The deductions from the capital account are on paper only, Kelly acknowledged. When partners leave the firm, they may be entitled to a payment from the capital account that Kelly says is reduced by the amount of reimbursements received.

But reimbursing partners out of their equity in the firm — as Kelly said Thornton did — is likely illegal, said Brett Kappel, a Washington lawyer who specializes in campaign finance.

“If they were legitimate contributions, they should have been deducted from their partnership distributions,” Kappel said.

Bradley, the senior partner, abruptly resigned his position as assistant majority leader in the state House of Representatives on June 27 after the Globe had begun asking questions about his firm’s business practices.

His decision stunned colleagues, coming so late in the election cycle that there was no time to take his name off the November ballot.

Bradley explained at the time that Michael Thornton was retiring and that he, Bradley, was being promoted to managing partner of his law firm. As a result, he wanted to focus on his legal work. Thornton is now chairman of the firm.

“I wouldn’t have the time to do this [legislative] job the way it should be done” because of the promotion, Bradley explained to the State House News Service. “It’s bittersweet for me.”

Some campaign finance experts say they expect Thornton’s reimbursement system is likely to raise suspicions among regulators and law enforcement officials alike.

“The use of the word ‘bonus’ for these payments, combined with the fact that they so closely matched the amounts and timing of the donations, would certainly capture the attention of the general counsel’s office at the FEC— and given how much was involved, the public integrity section at the Department of Justice,” said Kappel, the Washington campaign finance lawyer.

The Globe and the center could not find another law firm that used a similar reimbursement system. Thornton itself stopped the reimbursements when the Globe and the center began asking about it.

“I’ve been a partner at two law firms and have made many political donations,” said Leonard Kesten, a partner at Brody, Hardoon, Perkins and Kesten in Boston. “But I’ve never seen anything like this. It seems very peculiar.”

Meanwhile, in the Senate, measures to change the asbestos litigation system continue to pop up.

This year, the Furthering Asbestos Claim Transparency Act passed the House, but ran into opposition from Schumer, the New York senator who was a top recipient of Thornton donations.

It died in committee.

( ███ ) - In his brief three-month campaign for president , Michael Bloomberg poured nearly three-quarters of a billion dollars into building an advertising and data-mining juggernaut unlike anything the political world had ever seen .
U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg speaks to volunteers during a canvass kick-off as he campaigns in Manassas , Virginia , U.S. , March 2 , 2020 . ███/Kevin Lamarque
But a big part of the strategy hinged on a wildcard named Joe Biden .
Biden ’ s resurgence after a dominant victory on Saturday in South Carolina has upset that calculation in the critical do-or-die sprint before “ Super Tuesday , ” when Democrats in 14 states vote for the candidate to challenge Republican Donald Trump in November ’ s election .
It wasn ’ t supposed to be this way . The billionaire former New York City mayor ’ s strategy was partly based on expectations that Biden would falter in the first four states . Bloomberg , who skipped the early contests , would then become the moderate alternative to frontrunner Bernie Sanders , the Vermont senator and self-described democratic socialist .
Although Biden underperformed in Iowa and New Hampshire , he did better in Nevada and bounced back in South Carolina on a wave of African-American support to end Sanders ’ winning streak and establish himself as the race ’ s top-tier moderate Democrat .
Meanwhile , Bloomberg ’ s once-ascendant campaign has struggled after he came under fire in debates over past comments criticized as sexist and a policing policy he employed as New York ’ s mayor seen as racially discriminatory . He has apologized for the policing policy and for telling “ bawdy ” jokes .
Advisors and people close to the Bloomberg campaign say they are still in the race and rebuff criticism that he ’ s splitting the moderate vote and making it easier for Sanders to win .
The campaign ’ s internal polling showed that Bloomberg ’ s supporters have both Biden and Sanders as their second choices , contrary to the perception that he was mostly peeling off Biden ’ s support , one campaign official said .
If Bloomberg dropped out , Sanders would be on a stronger path to victory , the official said .
Bloomberg has hovered around 15 % in national polls , suggesting he will earn some delegates on Tuesday . If those polls are correct , he will likely earn fewer delegates than Sanders and Biden .
Another moderate , Pete Buttigieg , dropped out on Sunday , driven in part by a desire not to hand the nomination to Sanders , a top adviser said . “ Pete was not going to play the role of spoiler . ”
Bloomberg , however , has vowed to stay in the race until a candidate wins a majority of delegates needed to clinch the nomination . His campaign has spent heavily on advertising in states that vote on Tuesday , when a third of the available delegates that help select a Democratic nominee are awarded in a single day .
And it ’ s pinning some of its hopes on Virginia , the fourth-biggest state at stake on Tuesday and a key testing ground for Bloomberg . He made his first campaign visit here last November , and has visited another six times since . Last week , his campaign had hopes he could win or come close .
After Biden ’ s win in South Carolina , the former vice president picked up endorsements from former Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe and Virginia Senator Tim Kaine , the 2016 Democratic vice presidential candidate — underlining how Biden ’ s comeback is drawing establishment Democrats who might have otherwise backed Bloomberg .
Dan Blue , a prominent Democrat in the North Carolina State Senate who endorsed Bloomberg last week , said Biden ’ s strong showing in South Carolina reset the race . But he said he still believes that Bloomberg can win by playing the long game and gradually accumulating delegates .
“ There ’ s no question in my mind that this thing is very fluid and not absolute , ” he said .
Bloomberg ’ s heavy advertising spending , however , makes him a uniquely powerful candidate even if he lags in opinion polls .
He has spent more than half a billion dollars on ads ahead of Tuesday , more than four times the combined ad spending of his four remaining main rivals - Sanders , Biden , Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Amy Klobuchar , according to data from ad tracker Advertising Analytics .
The biggest chunk was spent in Super Tuesday states , $ 214 million through Feb. 25 , including more than $ 63 million in California and $ 50 million in Texas , where one analysis said 80 percent of the ads were Bloomberg ’ s .
Already , Bloomberg has spent more on television ads than Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton did in their entire 2016 campaigns .
“ It ’ s truly astonishing , ” said Michael Franz at Bowdoin College in Maine , a leading researcher on political advertising .
Many of his ads feature Trump , mocking the president as a “ bully. ” Others introduce his life story . When he drew criticism for sexist comments and past treatment of women on the job , one ad countered with endorsements from longtime women employees .
The campaign also has pushed beyond old frontiers with digital spending . More than $ 106 million have been poured into Google and Facebook ads , according to disclosures by the social media giants .
Without a young network of enthusiasts on social media like the one enjoyed by Sanders , Bloomberg has tried to boost his online presence by paying for one : he has hired influential meme accounts to post messages on Instagram , and paid others $ 2,500 a month to share pro-Bloomberg messages on texts and social media .
Inside his campaign headquarters in New York , the staff of Hawkfish , a start-up digital analytics company , sift through huge tranches of voter data to help chart his campaign strategy .
Bloomberg decided Hawkfish was necessary because Democrats haven ’ t kept up with Trump ’ s ability to target voters and bombard them with messages , said Dan Kanninen , the campaign ’ s states director . “ It ’ s a very potent , very difficult-to-overcome weapon . ”
His unprecedented spending has likely fueled his rise in public opinion polls from just around 5 % when he entered the race on Nov. 24 to about 16 % in recent polls .
“ The question is , how much can it buy him , and there ’ s definitely a ceiling , ” said Amanda Wintersieck , a political science professor at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond , Virginia .
In South Carolina , where he was not on the ballot but had still spent $ 2.3 million on advertising through Feb. 25 , two thirds of the primary voters said they viewed Bloomberg unfavorably , according to Edison Research exit polls . About 77 % and 51 % of these voters had favorable views of Biden and Sanders , respectively .
The spending has also provided a target for opponents who say Bloomberg is stark proof that the wealthy wield too much influence over U.S. elections .
In conversations with dozens of mostly Democratic voters across seven states last week , ███ found that Bloomberg ’ s spending blitz had won him a little enthusiasm , and some respect . Paula Abrams drove 100 miles through a snowstorm to attend a rally in an airplane hangar in Blountville , Tennessee , and plans to vote for him on Tuesday . “ He seems like he cares , ” said Abrams , 55 , an educator in Knoxville , Tennessee .
And Joy West , 62 , a retired teacher , says she thinks he ’ s the only one who can beat Trump . “ He really has the only chance of winning this thing . ”
Others were less forgiving . Bloomberg has apologized for overseeing an increase in the use of a police practice called “ stop and frisk ” in New York City that disproportionately affected black and other racial minority residents .
On Sunday , as Bloomberg started to speak about racial inequality at a chapel in Selma , Alabama — one of the 14 Super Tuesday states — about 10 people , mostly black , stood up and turned their backs . Biden was seated in a place of honor with the pastor at the same church .
“ I think it ’ s just an insult for him to come here , ” said Lisa Brown , who is black and a consultant who traveled to Selma from Los Angeles , referring to Bloomberg .
The incident underlined Bloomberg ’ s continued struggles to win over black voters — a core constituency for the Democratic Party .
Bloomberg ’ s supporters say they hope his spending will deliver dividends in battleground states that favor moderates like Virginia , where some polls put him ahead of Biden but at a close second behind Sanders .
Bloomberg made friends in Virginia long before his campaign , spending millions to elect Democrats to state offices and congressional seats , culminating with Democrats taking control of the state legislature last November . Last week , those legislators gave final approval to a sweeping set of gun control laws - a signature cause for Bloomberg .

(Reuters) - In his brief three-month campaign for president, Michael Bloomberg poured nearly three-quarters of a billion dollars into building an advertising and data-mining juggernaut unlike anything the political world had ever seen.

But a big part of the strategy hinged on a wildcard named Joe Biden.

Biden’s resurgence after a dominant victory on Saturday in South Carolina has upset that calculation in the critical do-or-die sprint before “Super Tuesday,” when Democrats in 14 states vote for the candidate to challenge Republican Donald Trump in November’s election.

It wasn’t supposed to be this way. The billionaire former New York City mayor’s strategy was partly based on expectations that Biden would falter in the first four states. Bloomberg, who skipped the early contests, would then become the moderate alternative to frontrunner Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator and self-described democratic socialist.

Although Biden underperformed in Iowa and New Hampshire, he did better in Nevada and bounced back in South Carolina on a wave of African-American support to end Sanders’ winning streak and establish himself as the race’s top-tier moderate Democrat.

Meanwhile, Bloomberg’s once-ascendant campaign has struggled after he came under fire in debates over past comments criticized as sexist and a policing policy he employed as New York’s mayor seen as racially discriminatory. He has apologized for the policing policy and for telling “bawdy” jokes.

Advisors and people close to the Bloomberg campaign say they are still in the race and rebuff criticism that he’s splitting the moderate vote and making it easier for Sanders to win.

The campaign’s internal polling showed that Bloomberg’s supporters have both Biden and Sanders as their second choices, contrary to the perception that he was mostly peeling off Biden’s support, one campaign official said.

If Bloomberg dropped out, Sanders would be on a stronger path to victory, the official said.

Bloomberg has hovered around 15% in national polls, suggesting he will earn some delegates on Tuesday. If those polls are correct, he will likely earn fewer delegates than Sanders and Biden.

Another moderate, Pete Buttigieg, dropped out on Sunday, driven in part by a desire not to hand the nomination to Sanders, a top adviser said. “Pete was not going to play the role of spoiler.”

Bloomberg, however, has vowed to stay in the race until a candidate wins a majority of delegates needed to clinch the nomination. His campaign has spent heavily on advertising in states that vote on Tuesday, when a third of the available delegates that help select a Democratic nominee are awarded in a single day.

And it’s pinning some of its hopes on Virginia, the fourth-biggest state at stake on Tuesday and a key testing ground for Bloomberg. He made his first campaign visit here last November, and has visited another six times since. Last week, his campaign had hopes he could win or come close.

But even that plan is facing new headwinds.

After Biden’s win in South Carolina, the former vice president picked up endorsements from former Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe and Virginia Senator Tim Kaine, the 2016 Democratic vice presidential candidate — underlining how Biden’s comeback is drawing establishment Democrats who might have otherwise backed Bloomberg.

Dan Blue, a prominent Democrat in the North Carolina State Senate who endorsed Bloomberg last week, said Biden’s strong showing in South Carolina reset the race. But he said he still believes that Bloomberg can win by playing the long game and gradually accumulating delegates.

“There’s no question in my mind that this thing is very fluid and not absolute,” he said.

‘TRULY ASTONISHING’

Bloomberg’s heavy advertising spending, however, makes him a uniquely powerful candidate even if he lags in opinion polls.

He has spent more than half a billion dollars on ads ahead of Tuesday, more than four times the combined ad spending of his four remaining main rivals - Sanders, Biden, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Amy Klobuchar, according to data from ad tracker Advertising Analytics.

The biggest chunk was spent in Super Tuesday states, $214 million through Feb. 25, including more than $63 million in California and $50 million in Texas, where one analysis said 80 percent of the ads were Bloomberg’s.

Already, Bloomberg has spent more on television ads than Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton did in their entire 2016 campaigns.

“It’s truly astonishing,” said Michael Franz at Bowdoin College in Maine, a leading researcher on political advertising.

Many of his ads feature Trump, mocking the president as a “bully.” Others introduce his life story. When he drew criticism for sexist comments and past treatment of women on the job, one ad countered with endorsements from longtime women employees.

The campaign also has pushed beyond old frontiers with digital spending. More than $106 million have been poured into Google and Facebook ads, according to disclosures by the social media giants.

Without a young network of enthusiasts on social media like the one enjoyed by Sanders, Bloomberg has tried to boost his online presence by paying for one: he has hired influential meme accounts to post messages on Instagram, and paid others $2,500 a month to share pro-Bloomberg messages on texts and social media.

Inside his campaign headquarters in New York, the staff of Hawkfish, a start-up digital analytics company, sift through huge tranches of voter data to help chart his campaign strategy.

Bloomberg decided Hawkfish was necessary because Democrats haven’t kept up with Trump’s ability to target voters and bombard them with messages, said Dan Kanninen, the campaign’s states director. “It’s a very potent, very difficult-to-overcome weapon.”

‘HOW MUCH CAN IT BUY HIM?’

His unprecedented spending has likely fueled his rise in public opinion polls from just around 5% when he entered the race on Nov. 24 to about 16% in recent polls.

“The question is, how much can it buy him, and there’s definitely a ceiling,” said Amanda Wintersieck, a political science professor at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, Virginia.

In South Carolina, where he was not on the ballot but had still spent $2.3 million on advertising through Feb. 25, two thirds of the primary voters said they viewed Bloomberg unfavorably, according to Edison Research exit polls. About 77% and 51% of these voters had favorable views of Biden and Sanders, respectively.

The spending has also provided a target for opponents who say Bloomberg is stark proof that the wealthy wield too much influence over U.S. elections.

In conversations with dozens of mostly Democratic voters across seven states last week, Reuters found that Bloomberg’s spending blitz had won him a little enthusiasm, and some respect. Paula Abrams drove 100 miles through a snowstorm to attend a rally in an airplane hangar in Blountville, Tennessee, and plans to vote for him on Tuesday. “He seems like he cares,” said Abrams, 55, an educator in Knoxville, Tennessee.

And Joy West, 62, a retired teacher, says she thinks he’s the only one who can beat Trump. “He really has the only chance of winning this thing.”

Others were less forgiving. Bloomberg has apologized for overseeing an increase in the use of a police practice called “stop and frisk” in New York City that disproportionately affected black and other racial minority residents.

On Sunday, as Bloomberg started to speak about racial inequality at a chapel in Selma, Alabama — one of the 14 Super Tuesday states — about 10 people, mostly black, stood up and turned their backs. Biden was seated in a place of honor with the pastor at the same church.

“I think it’s just an insult for him to come here,” said Lisa Brown, who is black and a consultant who traveled to Selma from Los Angeles, referring to Bloomberg.

The incident underlined Bloomberg’s continued struggles to win over black voters — a core constituency for the Democratic Party.

A VIRGINIA BATTLEGROUND

Bloomberg’s supporters say they hope his spending will deliver dividends in battleground states that favor moderates like Virginia, where some polls put him ahead of Biden but at a close second behind Sanders.

Bloomberg made friends in Virginia long before his campaign, spending millions to elect Democrats to state offices and congressional seats, culminating with Democrats taking control of the state legislature last November. Last week, those legislators gave final approval to a sweeping set of gun control laws - a signature cause for Bloomberg.

“I think people are appreciative,” said Lori Haas, Virginia director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence and a Bloomberg supporter.

campaign_finance,The Daily Caller,2,http://dailycaller.com/2018/05/15/clinton-campaign-hillary-payments/,"Clinton Campaign Funneled $150,000 To Hillary Clinton’s Personal Company",2018-05-15,,"Hillary Clinton ’ s presidential campaign has transferred nearly $ 150,000 of leftover campaign funds to a company she solely owns in the months following her election defeat , according to filings with the Federal Election Commission ( FEC ) .
The Clinton campaign has paid $ 149,457 to ZFS Holdings LLC , since May 2017 for the purpose of “ rent , ” FEC filings show , but the campaign has left it unclear if it ’ s paying at , above or below fair market value for the office space it ’ s renting .
Also , the rent payments to ZFS were sent to the same address as Rorrie Gregorio , Clinton ’ s personal financial manager .
“ Obviously , it has a certain fishiness to it , ” former FEC chairman and founder of the Institute for Free Speech Brad Smith told ███ News Foundation about the rent payments .
If ZFS is undercharging the Clinton campaign for rent , it could “ constitute something of value to the committee and would thus be an in-kind contribution , ” according to a 1995 FEC ruling . But if ZFS is overcharging the campaign , it could mean campaign funds are going to the company Clinton solely owns .
Using campaign funds for personal use is a violation of federal campaign law . According to Campaigns and Elections , “ knowing and willful ” violations of the personal use rule can result in prosecution and jail time .
Clinton registered ZFS as a single-member LLC shortly after she left the Department of State in early 2013 for the purpose of managing her speech and book income , according to financial disclosures she filed with the FEC .
What Is The Clinton Campaign Renting From Clinton ’ s Personal Office ?
Clinton signed a lease in 2014 for personal office space on the 27th floor of Tower 45 in Midtown Manhattan , according to news reports at the time . But ZFS is the actual leaseholder , according to CompStak Inc. , a provider of real estate data .
ZFS is renting an estimated 6,500 to 7,000 square feet and costing in the low $ 60s per square foot , according to crowdsourced , analyst-reviewed lease information CompStak provided TheDCNF . This means Clinton ’ s LLC is estimated to be paying between $ 32,500 to $ 38,000 per month for her Manhattan digs . The lease , according to Compstak , began in the second quarter of 2014 and will expire in the second quarter of 2019 .
After Clinton declared her candidacy in 2015 , Politico reported that her campaign had installed 10 to 15 campaign staffers and interns to work regularly in the Clinton ’ s Tower 45 office space .
But the Clinton campaign didn ’ t direct rent payments to ZFS during the election . Rather , regular monthly payments of $ 29,346 to $ 33,488 were sent to Kamber Management , the property manager for Tower 45 , filings to the FEC show .
The Clinton campaign made its last rent payment to Kamber on March 1 , 2017 . The campaign instead began directing rent payments to ZFS starting in May 2017 . TheDCNF found no indications the campaign has changed locations or that ZFS holds a lease at any other location , so it appears the campaign is paying for a portion of Clinton ’ s Tower 45 office space .
The Clinton campaign ’ s rent payments to ZFS vary greatly , despite the consistency of the payments it made to Kamber leading up to the 2016 election . For example , the campaign cut a rent check to ZFS on Oct. 18 , 2017 , for $ 36,369 , followed by a $ 9,618 rent payment on Nov. 11 , 2017 .
“ I would think that ’ s not usual , ” Smith told TheDCNF . “ That would be something that would cast out as to whether they ’ re actually paying market value . ”
A possible explanation is that ZFS is extending credit to the Clinton campaign . If that were the case , however , that could open up the Clinton campaign to reporting violations , according to Smith .
“ You can ’ t extend credit to a campaign on different terms than you would anybody else , ” Smith said . “ A landlord can ’ t say , ‘ well , you just pay me what rent you can when you can ’ — no , you can ’ t do that . ”
Smith said the varying nature of the campaign ’ s payments ZFS lead him to believe there likely isn ’ t a formal sublease agreement in place between it and Clinton ’ s LLC .
“ That ’ s what it sounds like , they don ’ t have any actual agreement , ” he said .
Also in May 2017 , Clinton announced that she had launched Onward Together , an organization established to lend support to progressive groups in “ organizing around our shared progressive values , mobilizing voters , or running candidates for office , ” its website said .
We ’ re launching Onward Together to encourage people to get involved , organize , and even run for office . https : //t.co/8exooosvZ5 — Hillary Clinton ( @ HillaryClinton ) May 15 , 2017
Onward Together is , in fact , two entities . One side of Onward Together is a nonprofit social welfare 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) organization , and the other , Onward Together Committee , is a PAC registered with the FEC .
Both sides of Onward Together are conducting business on the 27th floor of Tower 45 in Midtown Manhattan according to FEC and state filings , right alongside Clinton ’ s presidential campaign , which was still active as of March 2018 .
And just like the Clinton campaign , Onward Together 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) is making rent payments to ZFS , according to a budget it submitted to the North Carolina Secretary of State , which shows it had budgeted monthly rental expenses to ZFS ranging from $ 6,500 in May 2017 to $ 20,000 in December 2017 .
In addition , the nonprofit side of Onward Together has brought on a handful of Clinton aides since launching in 2017 , including longtime aide Huma Abedin , who earns an annual compensation of $ 48,000 , according to a document filed with the New Mexico Secretary of State .
The Clinton campaign contributed $ 800,000 to Onward Together when the organization was founded in May 2017 , FEC documents show . ( RELATED : Hillary Using $ 800K In Campaign Funds For New Political Group )
Four staffers are still on the Clinton campaign payroll as of March 2018 , two of which appear to be splitting time between the campaign and either Onward Together or the Office of Hillary Rodham Clinton .
Kelly Mehlenbacher , the treasury manager for the Clinton campaign , is one of those individuals . The Clinton campaign has paid Mehlenbacher $ 58,312 since the beginning of 2017 , coinciding with the $ 51,000 she ’ s estimated to have earned from Onward Together 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) as its chief operating officer .
Robert Vincent Russo serves as the director of correspondence and briefings at the Office of Hillary Rodham Clinton . While his LinkedIn provides that he stopped working for the Clinton campaign in May 2017 , he still collects $ 365 every other week from the campaign as of March 2018 .
It ’ s unclear why the Clinton campaign is still paying staffers . Neither Mehlenbacher , the Clinton campaign nor Onward Together responded to requests for comment .
“ During the campaign the office was a campaign office , ” Clinton ’ s communications director Nick Merrill told The Washington Free Beacon , who first reported the nearly $ 150,000 in payments . “ After the campaign , the office served as a personal office , a campaign wind-down office , and an office for Onward Together , so rent is split up accordingly . ”
The legality of the Clinton campaign ’ s rent payments to ZFS depends on whether the campaign is paying fair market value for the office space it ’ s renting , according to Smith .
“ The bottom line is that there ’ s a bunch of Clinton affiliated organizations that are renting space up there , and it doesn ’ t seem like there ’ s much really going on , ” Smith told TheDCNF . “ Rental payments all go to Hillary Clinton through her LLC . ”
“ Obviously , it has a certain fishiness to it , ” he added . “ If they are charging market rates , there ’ s probably nothing illegal per se about doing business with your own company charging market rates . ”
The FEC ruled in 1995 that a political campaign can rent space a candidate owns , provided the payments equal fair market value and the property is not the candidate ’ s personal property .
If the campaign pays more than the fair market value of the space it ’ s renting , the excessive payment would “ unduly augment the earnings of an asset owned by the candidate , ” the FEC ruled .
For example , Donald Trump ’ s presidential campaign made monthly payments of nearly $ 170,000 to Trump Tower Commercial LLC during the election .
“ We calculated the rent based on the average rent per square foot in the area , ” a Trump spokesman told Time in August 2016 . “ The campaign expanded from part of a single floor by adding the entirety of two separate floors . ”
The Trump campaign was open about its arrangement with Trump Tower , but the Clinton campaign has been tight-lipped about its agreement with ZFS .
ZFS Holdings Is The Technical Name For Hillary Clinton ’ s Personal Office
“ ZFS was set up when Secretary Clinton left the State Department as an entity to manage her book and speaking income , ” a spokesman for Clinton told The Guardian in 2016 .
Clinton earned over $ 33 million in speaking and book income through ZFS from 2013 through 2015 , according to her tax returns .
But ZFS does more than just manage Clinton ’ s speaking and book income . Documents reviewed by TheDCNF show that ZFS is the technical name for the Office of Hillary Rodham Clinton .
A former speechwriter for Clinton testified before the House Select Committee on Benghazi in October 2015 that he began working in Clinton ’ s personal office in February 2013 , but his paychecks came from ZFS .
“ It was Secretary Clinton ’ s personal office , and I believe the technical name was something like ZFS Holdings , ” the unnamed speechwriter said when asked to identify the entity that employed him after he began working at Clinton ’ s personal office .
ZFS paid $ 888,445 in wages in 2013 and 2014 , according to Clinton ’ s personal tax returns .
Clinton ’ s LLC has also owned four internet IP addresses since March 2014 , according to the American Registry for Internet Numbers . The registered customer for the IP addresses is ZFS , under the care of Rorrie Gregorio — the same Rorrie Gregorio that serves as Clinton ’ s personal financial manager .
It ’ s unclear what ZFS uses the IP addresses for . Attempts to ping the IP addresses were unsuccessful , and Gregorio did not respond when asked to comment on her relationship with ZFS .
ZFS and Gregorio are also linked to Clinton ’ s use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state .
The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs sent a letter to Gregorio in September 2015 requesting information about why she and ZFS were identified on monthly invoices issued by Platte River Networks , the entity Clinton contracted with to support her private server . ( RELATED : House Committee Seeks Charges For Hillary Clinton ’ s IT Firm )
ZFS now operates Clinton ’ s personal website , which has been rebranded as “ The Office of Hillary Rodham Clinton ” since her defeat in the 2016 election , according to her website ’ s privacy policy .","Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign has transferred nearly $150,000 of leftover campaign funds to a company she solely owns in the months following her election defeat, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission (FEC).

The Clinton campaign has paid $149,457 to ZFS Holdings LLC, since May 2017 for the purpose of “rent,” FEC filings show, but the campaign has left it unclear if it’s paying at, above or below fair market value for the office space it’s renting.

Also, the rent payments to ZFS were sent to the same address as Rorrie Gregorio, Clinton’s personal financial manager.

“Obviously, it has a certain fishiness to it,” former FEC chairman and founder of the Institute for Free Speech Brad Smith told The Daily Caller News Foundation about the rent payments.

If ZFS is undercharging the Clinton campaign for rent, it could “constitute something of value to the committee and would thus be an in-kind contribution,” according to a 1995 FEC ruling. But if ZFS is overcharging the campaign, it could mean campaign funds are going to the company Clinton solely owns.

Using campaign funds for personal use is a violation of federal campaign law. According to Campaigns and Elections, “knowing and willful” violations of the personal use rule can result in prosecution and jail time.

Clinton registered ZFS as a single-member LLC shortly after she left the Department of State in early 2013 for the purpose of managing her speech and book income, according to financial disclosures she filed with the FEC.

What Is The Clinton Campaign Renting From Clinton’s Personal Office?

Clinton signed a lease in 2014 for personal office space on the 27th floor of Tower 45 in Midtown Manhattan, according to news reports at the time. But ZFS is the actual leaseholder, according to CompStak Inc., a provider of real estate data.

ZFS is renting an estimated 6,500 to 7,000 square feet and costing in the low $60s per square foot, according to crowdsourced, analyst-reviewed lease information CompStak provided TheDCNF. This means Clinton’s LLC is estimated to be paying between $32,500 to $38,000 per month for her Manhattan digs. The lease, according to Compstak, began in the second quarter of 2014 and will expire in the second quarter of 2019.

After Clinton declared her candidacy in 2015, Politico reported that her campaign had installed 10 to 15 campaign staffers and interns to work regularly in the Clinton’s Tower 45 office space.

But the Clinton campaign didn’t direct rent payments to ZFS during the election. Rather, regular monthly payments of $29,346 to $33,488 were sent to Kamber Management, the property manager for Tower 45, filings to the FEC show.

The Clinton campaign made its last rent payment to Kamber on March 1, 2017. The campaign instead began directing rent payments to ZFS starting in May 2017. TheDCNF found no indications the campaign has changed locations or that ZFS holds a lease at any other location, so it appears the campaign is paying for a portion of Clinton’s Tower 45 office space.

(Graph: Daily Caller News Foundation/Andrew Kerr)

The Clinton campaign’s rent payments to ZFS vary greatly, despite the consistency of the payments it made to Kamber leading up to the 2016 election. For example, the campaign cut a rent check to ZFS on Oct. 18, 2017, for $36,369, followed by a $9,618 rent payment on Nov. 11, 2017.

“I would think that’s not usual,” Smith told TheDCNF. “That would be something that would cast out as to whether they’re actually paying market value.”

A possible explanation is that ZFS is extending credit to the Clinton campaign. If that were the case, however, that could open up the Clinton campaign to reporting violations, according to Smith.

“You can’t extend credit to a campaign on different terms than you would anybody else,” Smith said. “A landlord can’t say, ‘well, you just pay me what rent you can when you can’ — no, you can’t do that.”

Smith said the varying nature of the campaign’s payments ZFS lead him to believe there likely isn’t a formal sublease agreement in place between it and Clinton’s LLC.

“That’s what it sounds like, they don’t have any actual agreement,” he said.

The Clinton Campaign Isn’t Alone In Tower 45

Also in May 2017, Clinton announced that she had launched Onward Together, an organization established to lend support to progressive groups in “organizing around our shared progressive values, mobilizing voters, or running candidates for office,” its website said.

We’re launching Onward Together to encourage people to get involved, organize, and even run for office. https://t.co/8exooosvZ5 — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) May 15, 2017



Onward Together is, in fact, two entities. One side of Onward Together is a nonprofit social welfare 501(c)(4) organization, and the other, Onward Together Committee, is a PAC registered with the FEC.

Both sides of Onward Together are conducting business on the 27th floor of Tower 45 in Midtown Manhattan according to FEC and state filings, right alongside Clinton’s presidential campaign, which was still active as of March 2018.

And just like the Clinton campaign, Onward Together 501(c)(4) is making rent payments to ZFS, according to a budget it submitted to the North Carolina Secretary of State, which shows it had budgeted monthly rental expenses to ZFS ranging from $6,500 in May 2017 to $20,000 in December 2017.

Four staffers are still on the Clinton campaign payroll as of March 2018, two of which appear to be splitting time between the campaign and either Onward Together or the Office of Hillary Rodham Clinton.

Kelly Mehlenbacher, the treasury manager for the Clinton campaign, is one of those individuals. The Clinton campaign has paid Mehlenbacher $58,312 since the beginning of 2017, coinciding with the $51,000 she’s estimated to have earned from Onward Together 501(c)(4) as its chief operating officer.

Robert Vincent Russo serves as the director of correspondence and briefings at the Office of Hillary Rodham Clinton. While his LinkedIn provides that he stopped working for the Clinton campaign in May 2017, he still collects $365 every other week from the campaign as of March 2018.

It’s unclear why the Clinton campaign is still paying staffers. Neither Mehlenbacher, the Clinton campaign nor Onward Together responded to requests for comment.

“During the campaign the office was a campaign office,” Clinton’s communications director Nick Merrill told The Washington Free Beacon, who first reported the nearly $150,000 in payments. “After the campaign, the office served as a personal office, a campaign wind-down office, and an office for Onward Together, so rent is split up accordingly.”

The Arrangement Is Shrouded In “Fishiness”

The legality of the Clinton campaign’s rent payments to ZFS depends on whether the campaign is paying fair market value for the office space it’s renting, according to Smith.

“The bottom line is that there’s a bunch of Clinton affiliated organizations that are renting space up there, and it doesn’t seem like there’s much really going on,” Smith told TheDCNF. “Rental payments all go to Hillary Clinton through her LLC.”

“Obviously, it has a certain fishiness to it,” he added. “If they are charging market rates, there’s probably nothing illegal per se about doing business with your own company charging market rates.”

If the campaign pays more than the fair market value of the space it’s renting, the excessive payment would “unduly augment the earnings of an asset owned by the candidate,” the FEC ruled.

For example, Donald Trump’s presidential campaign made monthly payments of nearly $170,000 to Trump Tower Commercial LLC during the election.

“We calculated the rent based on the average rent per square foot in the area,” a Trump spokesman told Time in August 2016. “The campaign expanded from part of a single floor by adding the entirety of two separate floors.”

It’s also a departure from recent decades, in which the industry overall favored Republican congressional and presidential candidates in eight of the past 10 election cycles, with Democrats getting more in 2008 and 2010.

Since Trump locked up the Republican nomination three months ago, employees of 25 of the nation’s largest defense companies have donated $93,000 to Clinton, compared with $46,000 for Trump, according to a POLITICO review of filings with the Federal Election Commission. Clinton's donor rolls also include more than two dozen top defense executives, while Trump’s show just two.

Donors with ties to Pentagon contractors may simply be betting Clinton will win. But some say they are concerned about Trump's pronouncements on national security, which have included skepticism about NATO’s role in countering Russia, and they fear he will follow through on his pledge to upend business as usual in Washington.

Clinton, meanwhile, was an ally to some of them when she was in the Senate and served on the Armed Services Committee.

“My view is Hillary is far more aligned with the types of issues that are important to the defense industry than Trump is,” Hudson said.

Officially, defense firms are trying to avoid taking sides in this year’s race for the White House — with most of their corporate political action committees contributing to House and Senate candidates but not to the Clinton or Trump campaigns.

But that hasn’t stopped many of their top executives from making their preferences known through individual contributions. And those preferences skew toward Clinton, who defense watchers say offers what weapons makers crave most: predictability.

“In the case of Trump vs. Clinton, defense executives see the same thing in Trump that people in other industries and the media see, which is that he’s a totally unknown quantity, and that’s scary,” said industry consultant Loren Thompson, who plans to vote for the former secretary of State.

A number of big names in defense circles have opened their checkbooks for Clinton. They include former Lockheed Martin CEO Robert Stevens; Edward Kangas, who chairs the board of directors at United Technologies; Pam Wickham, the vice president for corporate affairs and communications at Raytheon; John Casey, who leads the Marine Systems division at General Dynamics; Vivek Lall, a senior executive at General Atomics; and Frank Ruggiero, the top in-house lobbyist at BAE Systems, among others.

At least four other in-house lobbyists at Lockheed have given to Clinton.

Scott Feeney, the director of international government relations at Rockwell Collins, has given $225 this year to the Trump campaign, and Jennifer Gallagher, listed as a senior manager for government relations at Raytheon, has given $250.

Feeney did not respond to a request for comment, and Gallagher declined through a spokesman to comment.

One Republican defense lobbyist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he said he has to preserve relationships on both sides of the aisle, said the defense “community is just much more comfortable with Clinton.”

The lobbyist said he plans to vote for Clinton in what will be his first vote ever for a Democratic presidential candidate.

“With Hillary Clinton we have some sense of where she would go, and with Trump we have none,” the lobbyist said. “He knows nothing about the system.”

Bernie Sanders 's ( I-Vt. ) presidential campaign .
A handful of new liberal outside groups have cropped up in recent weeks , many of them founded by former aides and allies of Sanders and other prominent progressives . Their goals range from boosting the presidential campaign of former Vice President Joe Biden to patching what they see as electoral holes in the Democrats ' organizing strategy .
But the proliferation of super PACs has come at a cost for some in the progressive movement , which has long denounced the existence of such groups and the influence of money in politics .
Sanders himself has privately expressed frustration with one such super PAC , originally called Future to Believe In PAC after the Vermont senator 's campaign slogan . The group was formed late last month by a handful of former aides to Sanders 's campaign , including senior adviser Jeff Weaver , to boost Biden among progressives .
Sanders 's displeasure with the formation of the super PAC prompted its founders to change its name this week to America 's Promise PAC to avoid the appearance that it is tied to Sanders or his campaign .
For Weaver and others , the decision to form a super PAC appears to stem more from a sense of urgency than a genuine comfort with such groups , which can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money so long as they do not coordinate with a candidate or campaign .
In a memo issued on Friday , Weaver warned that lagging support and enthusiasm for Biden 's candidacy among progressives has the potential to sink the former vice president 's chances of ousting President Trump in November . America 's Promise PAC , he wrote , could help Biden `` make up that ground . ''
`` [ D ] espite best intentions , the Biden campaign and the [ Democratic National Committee ] are far behind on digital organizing , Latino outreach and progressive coalition building - all critical to reaching and winning over Sanders supporters , '' Weaver wrote .
Chuck Rocha , a former senior adviser to Sanders who is involved in America 's Promise PAC and is spearheading the creation of another group , Nuestro PAC , said that super PACs are simply a means to an end : helping Democrats and progressives win up and down the ballot .

One of the draws of super PACs - in addition to being allowed to raise and spend unlimited sums of money - is that they promise political operatives freedom that they often do n't get within the rigid and bureaucratic structure of traditional campaigns , said Linh Nguyen , a former presidential campaign staffer for Sen.

We 're going to get a lot of criticism , but we do n't want to shy away from it . ''","Progressives are embracing super PACs with newfound vigor as they look to put their political influence and organizing tactics to use in the aftermath of Sen. Bernie Sanders's (I-Vt.) presidential campaign.

A handful of new liberal outside groups have cropped up in recent weeks, many of them founded by former aides and allies of Sanders and other prominent progressives. Their goals range from boosting the presidential campaign of former Vice President Joe Biden to patching what they see as electoral holes in the Democrats' organizing strategy.

But the proliferation of super PACs has come at a cost for some in the progressive movement, which has long denounced the existence of such groups and the influence of money in politics.

Sanders himself has privately expressed frustration with one such super PAC, originally called Future to Believe In PAC after the Vermont senator's campaign slogan. The group was formed late last month by a handful of former aides to Sanders's campaign, including senior adviser Jeff Weaver, to boost Biden among progressives.

Sanders's displeasure with the formation of the super PAC prompted its founders to change its name this week to America's Promise PAC to avoid the appearance that it is tied to Sanders or his campaign.

For Weaver and others, the decision to form a super PAC appears to stem more from a sense of urgency than a genuine comfort with such groups, which can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money so long as they do not coordinate with a candidate or campaign.

In a memo issued on Friday, Weaver warned that lagging support and enthusiasm for Biden's candidacy among progressives has the potential to sink the former vice president's chances of ousting President Trump in November. America's Promise PAC, he wrote, could help Biden ""make up that ground.""

""[D]espite best intentions, the Biden campaign and the [Democratic National Committee] are far behind on digital organizing, Latino outreach and progressive coalition building - all critical to reaching and winning over Sanders supporters,"" Weaver wrote.

Chuck Rocha, a former senior adviser to Sanders who is involved in America's Promise PAC and is spearheading the creation of another group, Nuestro PAC, said that super PACs are simply a means to an end: helping Democrats and progressives win up and down the ballot.

Unlike traditional political action committees and political nonprofits, super PACs can act as a ""partisan hammer,"" Rocha said, a role that traditional campaigns and PACs can't necessarily fill.

""I am anti all this money in politics and if we can operate without super PACs, I would vote for that everyday,"" Rocha told The Hill. ""But I've got to do something right now. I don't have the privilege to be able to wait around until there aren't super PACs on either side.""

Rocha and his political consulting firm Solidarity Strategies launched Nuestro PAC last month to turn out Latino voters in the fall using the same playbook that helped Sanders win broad support among Latinos during his primary campaign. Rocha himself is currently the largest donor to the super PAC. He said that he's courting other progressive and Democratic-leaning groups to help fund the effort.

Rocha said he won't accept contributions from corporate interests or business executives.

""Super PACs aren't the problem. The problem is corporate money in super PACs,"" he said. ""I don't know any corporations who would give Chuck Rocha or Nuestro Pac any donations anyway.""

Still, the move towards super PACs has received blowback from some progressives. Rocha said he has lost thousands of followers on Twitter since started Nuestro PAC last month.

WASHINGTON – Two Ukrainian-born business partners , who showered Republican campaign committees with nearly $ 500,000 and dined with President Donald Trump at the White House , were charged Thursday in connection with alleged schemes to funnel foreign money to U.S. political campaigns , federal authorities said Thursday .
Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman helped Rudy Giuliani meet a Ukrainian prosecutor as the president 's personal lawyer pushed for an investigation into Trump 's political rival Joe Biden . Both of the men are among prospective witnesses House Democrats want to question in their impeachment inquiry .
The indictment charges Parnas , Fruman , David Correia and Andrey Kukushkin with federal campaign finance law violations .
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said Parnas and Fruman were arrested Wednesday evening at Dulles International Airport near Washington as they prepared to board a international flight with one-way tickets . Berman did not reveal their destination , but a person familiar with the matter said they were ticketed for Frankfurt , Germany . Kukushkin was arrested in San Francisco , and Correia was not yet in custody late Thursday .
Prosecutors allege that they “ conspired to circumvent the federal laws against foreign influence by engaging in a scheme to funnel foreign money to candidates for federal and state office so that the defendants could buy potential influence with candidates , campaigns and the candidates ’ governments . ”
`` Protecting the integrity of our elections ( is ) the core function of our campaign finance laws , '' Berman said Thursday , adding that the inquiry was continuing .
Giuliani : Trump-Ukraine blow-up puts spotlight on Rudy Giuliani 's business ties . Is he a 'foreign agent ' ?
A federal judge in Alexandria , Virginia , late Thursday set bail at $ 1 million each , requiring that they submit to electronic monitoring and home detention if they are released . Their travel would be limited to south Florida , where they have lived , and New York , where the charges have been filed and the case against them will proceed .
Parnas and Fruman began attending campaign fundraising events in March 2018 , the indictment alleges .
According to court documents , Fruman contributed $ 10,000 on Nov. 1 , 2018 , to a Nevada state candidate . State campaign finance filings show Fruman contributed to the campaigns of two Republican candidates : Adam Laxalt , former state attorney general , and Wesley Duncan , former state assembly member .
Having no significant prior history of political giving , the pair “ sought to advance their personal financial interests and the political interests of at least one Ukrainian government official with whom they were working , ” the indictment charges .
Among their beneficiaries , according to court documents , was a U.S. congressman who received $ 5,400 last year from the pair who also pledged raise $ 20,000 for the lawmaker as they sought to enlist him in an effort to remove Marie Yovanovitch as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine . The congressman was not named in court documents , but a person familiar with the matter identified the lawmaker as former Rep. Pete Sessions , R-Texas .
Sessions wrote a letter last year to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo , urging Yovanovitch 's ouster . The former congressman could not be immediately reached for comment . Yovanovitch was recalled in May .
To hide their sources of funding and capital , Parnas and Fruman created a limited liability company called Global Energy Producers and “ intentionally caused certain large contributions to be reported in the name of GEP instead of their own names , ” the indictment says .
When news about the Global Energy Producers ' contributions surfaced , the indictment says , an individual working with Parnas remarked that this `` is what happens when you become visible … the buzzards descend . '' Parnas responded , that 's `` why we need to stay under the radar . ''
The indictment alleges that Parnas , Fruman , Correia and Kukushkin schemed with an unidentified foreign national who is a Russian citizen to get retail marijuana licenses in states , including Nevada . In or around September and October 2018 , Correia drafted a table of prospective political donations . The table allegedly described a multistate licensing strategy that would funnel $ 1 million to $ 2 million in contributions to federal and state political committees .
The plan allegedly included a funding schedule of two $ 500,000 transfers . The foreign national arranged for the funds to be wired on or around Sept. 18 , 2018 , and Oct. 16 , 2018 , from overseas accounts to a U.S. corporate bank account controlled by Fruman and another individual , ” the indictment charges .
The alleged conspirators are accused of taking steps to hide the foreign national ’ s involvement and role in the funding . In Kukushkin 's words , hiding the foreign national 's role was necessary because of `` his Russian roots and current political paranoia about it , '' the indictment says .
Parnas and Fruman , who were born in Ukraine when it was part of the Soviet Union and live in Florida , have become political players in recent years . In May 2018 , Parnas posted pictures on Facebook of himself and Fruman with Trump in the White House and with the president 's son Donald Jr. in California . That was the same month their company , Global Energy Producers , was credited with giving $ 325,000 to the committee that supports Trump 's reelection , America First Action SuperPac .
The campaign contribution sparked a complaint to the Federal Election Commission – and at least two lawsuits – because of questions about the source of the money . Berman , appointed by Trump , characterized the $ 325,000 contribution as `` one of the largest donations '' received by the committee .
Thursday , the committee acknowledged receiving the Global Energy Producers donation in May 2018 .
`` In July 2018 , a complaint was filed with the Federal Election Commission concerning this contribution , '' the committee said in a written statement . `` There is also separate litigation pending in Florida that concerns these funds . Accordingly , America First Action placed that contribution in a segregated bank account , it has not been used for any purpose and the funds will remain in this segregated account until these matters are resolved . We take our legal obligations seriously and scrupulously comply with the law and any suggestion otherwise is false . ”
Three House committees – Foreign Affairs , Intelligence and Oversight and Reform – scheduled depositions Thursday with Parnas and Friday with Fruman to ask how they fit in with Trump 's dealings with Ukraine . Those panels have subpoenaed documents from Giuliani and Secretary of State Pompeo .
Attorney John Dowd , who represents the two men , had earlier notified the committees that they were given too little notice to prepare . Dowd did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday .
The impeachment investigation has focused on a phone call July 25 in which Trump urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden . Text messages between top State Department officials suggested the demand was a trade-off for nearly $ 400 million in military aid .
Trump has tweeted that as president , he has `` an absolute right , perhaps even a duty , '' to investigate corruption . He defended his discussion with Zelensky as a `` perfect '' call and said there was no quid pro quo between the request to investigate Biden and the military aid .
White House counsel Pat Cipollone notified House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif. , and the three committee chairmen Tuesday that Trump would not cooperate with an investigation he considers partisan and unfair .

Parnas and Fruman drew the congressional spotlight because they helped arrange a meeting in January in New York between Giuliani and Ukraine ’ s then-prosecutor general , Yuri Lutsenko , according to Ukrainian media reports .
Former Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin , Lutsenko ’ s predecessor , is at the heart of the impeachment inquiry because Trump and Giuliani pushed an unsubstantiated claim that Biden urged Shokin 's removal in 2016 to thwart an investigation into a company tied to his son Hunter . Biden denied wrongdoing , and Lutsenko told The Washington Post that Hunter Biden `` did not violate anything . ”
Dowd , the lawyer who represents Parnas and Fruman , told the Intelligence Committee by letter Oct. 3 that they could n't meet a deadline Monday for documents and communications because the men were also represented by Giuliani and the material might be protected by attorney-client privilege .
`` Your request for documents and communications is overly broad and unduly burdensome , '' Dowd told the panel , calling the request an effort to `` harass , intimidate and embarrass my clients . '' Dowd said the committee should recognize `` some semblance of due process , fairness , justice and common decency . ''
Parnas told The Miami Herald the impeachment inquiry is a `` soap opera , '' and he defended Trump .

`` I got certain information , and I thought it was my duty to hand it over , '' Parnas told the Herald .
If Parnas and Fruman refuse to testify , the committees could subpoena them . Gordon Sondland , the U.S. ambassador to the European Union , was subpoenaed Tuesday after refusing to appear to describe his role in dealings with Ukraine .
The $ 325,000 campaign contribution May 17 , 2018 , took a wayward path to America First Action , a political action committee that supports Trump ’ s reelection . The contribution was attributed to the company Global Energy Producers on the committee 's report to the Federal Election Commission . Parnas was listed as CEO of the company and Fruman as president in other campaign documents .
According to The Associated Press , the money actually came from a different corporate entity , Aaron Investments I , which was managed by Parnas and his wife . Aaron Investments received $ 1.2 million from the proceeds of a private mortgage May 15 , 2018 , secured by a condo unit in North Miami Beach owned by a separate corporation tied to Fruman , according to AP . Wire-transfer records show $ 325,000 was then wired from Aaron Investments to America First Action , even though the contribution was credited to Global Energy Producers .
The Campaign Legal Center , a nonpartisan campaign finance watchdog based in Washington , filed a complaint with the FEC in July 2018 arguing that Global Energy Producers shielded the source of the political contribution . Under federal law , contributions must be attributed to the person or entity providing the money , to avoid straw donations .
Parnas and Fruman were generous to a variety of Republican campaign groups . Parnas has contributed nearly $ 125,000 since October 2016 and Fruman more than $ 44,000 , according to FEC records .
The large political contributions prompted at least two lawsuits against Parnas for unpaid debts .
A Florida man named Felix Vulis filed a state lawsuit in March against Fruman , Parnas and Global Energy Producers seeking repayment of a $ 100,000 loan that was provided to help the business achieve the goal of becoming the country 's biggest exporter of liquid natural gas . Vulis wrote a check Oct. 1 , 2018 , that was supposed to be repaid by Dec. 1 , 2018 , but was n't , according to the lawsuit . Both sides said the case was settled amicably Aug. 23 .
A thornier case lingers from a federal judgment that Parnas owes for a movie that never got made .
The Pues Family Trust IRA filed a federal lawsuit in 2011 in New York City seeking repayment of a $ 350,000 loan to Parnas . The trust 's executor , Michael Pues , described the money in court documents as a bridge loan for a movie with the working title `` Anatomy of an Assassin , '' while Parnas found more investors .
Parnas denied in a court filing that the money was a loan . Parnas said the movie , which he said was going to be called `` Memory of a Killer , '' fell apart because of financing problems , including Pues not contributing $ 1 million as promised .
A judgment in the federal case in March 2016 ordered Parnas to pay the Pues Family Trust $ 510,435 for the loan and 9 % annual interest .
After learning of the political contribution , Pues asked a federal court in Florida in January 2019 to enforce the unpaid judgment . Pues asked the court to undo the political contribution related to Global Energy Producers , Aaron Investments I and America First Action , so the judgment can be partially repaid .
America First Action said in a filing in July that it objected to the lawsuit 's claim that the $ 325,000 contribution came from Aaron Investments rather than Global Energy Producers . The committee said it would provide documents that related to the wire transfer .
Parnas argued against a subpoena for Global Energy Producers in the case , saying the company was n't involved in the case that led to the New York judgment .

""I got certain information, and I thought it was my duty to hand it over,"" Parnas told the Herald.

If Parnas and Fruman refuse to testify, the committees could subpoena them. Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, was subpoenaed Tuesday after refusing to appear to describe his role in dealings with Ukraine.

Parnas, Fruman support Trump

The $325,000 campaign contribution May 17, 2018, took a wayward path to America First Action, a political action committee that supports Trump’s reelection. The contribution was attributed to the company Global Energy Producers on the committee's report to the Federal Election Commission. Parnas was listed as CEO of the company and Fruman as president in other campaign documents.

According to The Associated Press, the money actually came from a different corporate entity, Aaron Investments I, which was managed by Parnas and his wife. Aaron Investments received $1.2 million from the proceeds of a private mortgage May 15, 2018, secured by a condo unit in North Miami Beach owned by a separate corporation tied to Fruman, according to AP. Wire-transfer records show $325,000 was then wired from Aaron Investments to America First Action, even though the contribution was credited to Global Energy Producers.

Four days after the contribution, on May 21, 2018, Parnas posted a picture on Facebook of himself with Fruman and Trump Jr. at a breakfast at the Beverly Hills Polo Lounge in California. ""Power Breakfast!!!"" the caption said. Parnas had previously posted a picture of himself with Trump at the White House on May 1, describing an “incredible dinner and even better conversation.”

The Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan campaign finance watchdog based in Washington, filed a complaint with the FEC in July 2018 arguing that Global Energy Producers shielded the source of the political contribution. Under federal law, contributions must be attributed to the person or entity providing the money, to avoid straw donations.

Parnas and Fruman were generous to a variety of Republican campaign groups. Parnas has contributed nearly $125,000 since October 2016 and Fruman more than $44,000, according to FEC records.

A legal case right out of the movies

The large political contributions prompted at least two lawsuits against Parnas for unpaid debts.

A Florida man named Felix Vulis filed a state lawsuit in March against Fruman, Parnas and Global Energy Producers seeking repayment of a $100,000 loan that was provided to help the business achieve the goal of becoming the country's biggest exporter of liquid natural gas. Vulis wrote a check Oct. 1, 2018, that was supposed to be repaid by Dec. 1, 2018, but wasn't, according to the lawsuit. Both sides said the case was settled amicably Aug. 23.

A thornier case lingers from a federal judgment that Parnas owes for a movie that never got made.

The Pues Family Trust IRA filed a federal lawsuit in 2011 in New York City seeking repayment of a $350,000 loan to Parnas. The trust's executor, Michael Pues, described the money in court documents as a bridge loan for a movie with the working title ""Anatomy of an Assassin,"" while Parnas found more investors.

Parnas denied in a court filing that the money was a loan. Parnas said the movie, which he said was going to be called ""Memory of a Killer,"" fell apart because of financing problems, including Pues not contributing $1 million as promised.

A judgment in the federal case in March 2016 ordered Parnas to pay the Pues Family Trust $510,435 for the loan and 9% annual interest.

After learning of the political contribution, Pues asked a federal court in Florida in January 2019 to enforce the unpaid judgment. Pues asked the court to undo the political contribution related to Global Energy Producers, Aaron Investments I and America First Action, so the judgment can be partially repaid.

America First Action said in a filing in July that it objected to the lawsuit's claim that the $325,000 contribution came from Aaron Investments rather than Global Energy Producers. The committee said it would provide documents that related to the wire transfer.

Parnas argued against a subpoena for Global Energy Producers in the case, saying the company wasn't involved in the case that led to the New York judgment.

The deep-pocketed political network created by the billionaire conservatives Charles and David Koch this summer quietly launched a super PAC that can buy explicitly political ads supporting Republican candidates rather than the issue-oriented ads they ‘ d been airing for years .

███ was allowed to review an advanced copy of the mandatory report the super PAC will file Wednesday with the Federal Election Commission that will formally reveal the names of some of the Kochs ’ ultra-rich conservative donors . The report , combined with additional information voluntarily provided by Freedom Partners Action Fund , are illuminating , testing some of the conventional wisdom surrounding the Koch political operation .
New York hedge fund billionaire Bob Mercer wrote the largest check — $ 2.5 million — followed by Charles and David Koch , who each stroked $ 2 million checks from trusts in their names . The group received $ 1 million apiece from Arkansas poultry producer Ronnie Cameron , Wisconsin roofing billionaire Diane Hendricks and Nebraska trucking magnate Clarence Werner .
“ I just felt like it ’ s time to stand up and put my money where my mouth is , ” said Cameron , who made his donation in two equal checks through Mountaire Corp. , the Arkansas-based poultry company he owns . Cameron donated at least $ 1 million in 2011 to non-disclosing groups in the Koch network , but the contribution to Freedom Partners Action Fund was far more than he ’ d ever given to any political committee that lists its donors . He admitted he thought long and hard “ about getting the publicity because most of us are private — I work very hard to keep my name out of stuff . ”
“ I just kind of decided that it was more important to support it than it was to maintain my privacy , ” Cameron said . “ I ’ m 69 years old . I ’ m much more concerned that my grandkids could be living under communism , or something like it , with the type of leadership that we have right now . ”
While the Kochs ’ political operation is often portrayed as being entirely supported by the billionaire brothers , roughly 650 donors combined to contribute the more than $ 15 million raised by the super PAC ’ s from its June creation through the end of September . The majority of the donations were smaller than the $ 200 threshold that triggers FEC disclosure requirements , and as such , aren ’ t listed in the report , which doesn ’ t include continued brisk fundraising this month , during which Freedom Partners spokesman James Davis said the PAC was expecting to bring in an additional $ 10 million .
The ability to quickly corral such a robust war chest for a type of political spending that was once dominated by the Republican Party and its big-name operatives like Karl Rove further demonstrates the Koch network ’ s evolution from a guerrilla band on the libertarian fringes of the right to arguably the preeminent force in conservative politics .
That change is further illustrated by a recent strategic shift by the most robust of the nonprofit groups in the Kochs ’ vast network , Americans for Prosperity . It is for the first time instructing its army of grass-roots field staff and volunteer canvassers to urge voters to reject Democratic Senate candidates on Election Day .
AFP ’ s $ 125 million spending plan for 2014 dwarfs the budgets of Freedom Partners Action Fund and the half dozen or so other groups that comprise the core of the Koch network . All but Freedom Partners Action Fund do not have to release their spending or donor information . In all , the network — which is overseen by the umbrella group that started the super PAC , Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce — intends to spend a total of $ 290 million this year .
For context , that ’ s more than the Republican National Committee or the Democratic National Committee spent during the entire 2010 midterm election cycle . It demonstrates the degree to which the Koch network has come to rival the parties ’ operations , complete with nonprofit arms targeting key demographics like Hispanics , millennials and veterans , not to mention groups developing cutting edge data-driven voter-targeting platforms .

Freedom Partners Action Fund drew particular notice from Koch Kremlinologists when it was added to the arsenal . As the only super PAC in the Kochs ’ orbit , it fills a specialized niche — expressly supporting Republican candidates and opposing Democratic ones — that had been largely lacking in the network , which initially eschewed partisan politics in favor of wonkier libertarian policy advocacy . While the rest of the network had spent tens of millions on ads and other communications assailing Democratic senators such as Alaska ’ s Mark Begich and North Carolina ’ s Kay Hagan for supporting President Barack Obama ’ s policy agenda , the groups usually stopped just short of advocating throwing them out of office .
In exchange for the ability to take that extra rhetorical step , FEC rules require big money groups to register as super PACs , which triggers the donor disclosure requirement . It ’ s probably unlikely that the Koch network would have embraced voluntarily disclosure without the super PAC . But its creation came amidst a concerted campaign to engage more with the public and media by the Kochs ’ multinational corporate conglomerate Koch Industries and the Kochs ’ political operation — both of which have been branded by critics as shadowy and secretive .
In fact , at least one donor to the super PAC — billionaire Minnesota media mogul Stanley Hubbard — has urged fellow donors , including Charles Koch himself , to become more open with their views and political spending .
“ You should stand up for what you believe in and hope that others will follow , or they ’ ll at least talk to you about it , ” said Hubbard , whose family company Hubbard Broadcasting donated $ 150,000 last month to Freedom Partners Action Fund . “ We have never been people who are afraid to say here ’ s what we believe in . ”
He and Cameron both said that they made their donations partly as a show of solidarity with the Kochs . The brothers have become the targets of vituperative liberal attacks waged by Harry Reid and his allies .
“ The Koch brothers are great Americans and they have demonstrated over a period of time that they ’ re willing to do far more than most people are willing to do for their country in terms of political involvement and giving , ” said Hubbard , who attends some of the the twice annual fundraising seminars staged by the Kochs . “ We ’ re very proud to be a part of that . ”
Freedom Partners Action Fund ’ s FEC reports could provide additional fodder for the Kochs ’ liberal antagonists . Until now , they have mostly kept their fire trained on the brothers themselves , and not the other donors in their network whose identities have periodically been revealed by leaks around the seminars .
“ Reading all the stuff , you ’ d think that it was all the Kochs ’ money , ” said Cameron . “ There are hundreds of people like me that are joining what they do . And their part is a great part but the biggest part they play is kind of bringing people together and educating them as to what ’ s going on and what the need is . ”
The super PAC ’ s report includes a host of major donors who have attended some of the twice-annual donor summits the Kochs began hosting in 2003 but who have been less public about their political giving and their affiliation with the Kochs — such as Hendricks , Cameron , John W. Childs , Ned Diefenthal , George W. Gibbs , Robert Rowling and Dian Graves Stai .
There is significant crossover between the super PAC ’ s donor rolls and the 200-plus members of its parent group , Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce . A nonprofit hub founded in late 2011 to collect and disseminate donor funding within the network , the group has come to host the seminars . It ’ s also worked to make the political operation more open and professional , helping coordinate the activities of the network ’ s groups to avoid overlap and maximize the impact of donor cash .
That is a major emphasis of the network and one that came under scrutiny after the 2012 election , when the component groups combined to spend more than $ 400 million . After Obama won reelection and Democrats retained control of the Senate , some wealthy conservatives openly questioned whether they had squandered their cash on huge checks to the Koch network and other groups , including those conceived by Rove .
The move into more overt advocacy in support of Republicans , through the Freedom Partners super PAC and AFP ’ s more aggressive canvassing , seems partly intended to avert another grave disappointment . It also undercuts a criticism that the Koch operation had faced within in the highly competitive world of GOP big-money politics . Rivals had privately argued to donors that the Koch operation wasn ’ t making the best use of its money because its groups stopped short of advocating a vote for Republican candidates or against Democratic ones .
Koch allies shrug off that criticism , attributing it to desperation from operatives who couldn ’ t offer a compelling case to donors about what they would do differently to avoid a repeat of 2012 . The Freedom Partners super PAC is only likely to heighten the competition as it encroaches on groups like Rove ’ s and allows donors to treat the Koch network as a one-stop shop that now offers an outlet for almost every form of political advocacy .
“ There ’ s a delicate balance between the idealistic causes and the pragmatic ones , ” said Arizona businessman Jack Biltis . A midsized donor who co-founded a human resources company , Biltis last month donated $ 75,000 — which he called “ my biggest contribution so far ” — to Freedom Partners Action Fund . “ After getting to know the people at Freedom Partners , I came to the conclusion that they support truly free market candidates and efforts but can execute a game plan to turn the plan into reality , ” he said .

Four months later and the results are in: The super PAC, Freedom Partners Action Fund, is a smash hit with donors. It has surpassed its fundraising goal and now says it is on pace to spend roughly $25 million on ads intended to help Republicans capture the Senate.

Bloomberg has not yet announced whether he will run in the Democratic primary . If he runs , he will use that half-billion-dollar stake — roughly $ 175 million more than the Trump campaign spent over the course of the entire 2016 election cycle — to fuel his campaign through the 2020 primary season , with the expectation that the sum represents a floor , not a ceiling , on his potential spending .
If Bloomberg declines to seek the presidency , his intention is to run an unprecedented data-heavy campaign designed to operate as a shadow political party for the eventual Democratic nominee .
“ That ’ ll get us through the first few months , ” Kevin Sheekey , a top adviser to the former New York mayor , told ███ when asked about the $ 500 million plan , which is just 1 percent of Bloomberg ’ s estimated net worth .
“ Mike spent $ 100 million in his last New York City election . And you can do the math as you think more broadly but New York City is 3 percent of the national population , ” Sheekey said . “ I ’ m not suggesting it ’ s straight math . But I ’ m suggesting that when Mike Bloomberg is committed to making a difference and seeing something though , generally speaking he ’ s pretty unabashed in doing so . ”

To that end , Bloomberg has assembled a political team that , since late November , has been meeting at least once weekly in the Manhattan headquarters of Bloomberg Philanthropies to consider what some aides have called “ Plan A ” and “ Plan B . ”
Plan A is straightforward : Bloomberg runs for president as a Democrat , not as an independent candidate as he had mused privately in the past . According to Plan B , Bloomberg uses all the data — ranging from meticulously researched profiles of voters to polling data on the top issues that move the electorate — and field staff to help the otherwise-outgunned Democratic Party nominee to end Trump ’ s presidency .
Bloomberg said Friday at an event in Orlando , Fla. , that he ’ ll make a decision in “ three more weeks . ”
He also made clear that he ’ s not waiting on former Vice President Joe Biden , who ’ s also mulling a bid for president and who , Bloomberg advisers acknowledge , could draw from the same pool of moderate primary voters .
`` My decision does n't depend on what other people are going to do , '' Bloomberg told The Associated Press . `` My decision depends on whether or not I think I can make a difference . ''
Still , the subject of Biden has come up in discussions with those who have discussed Bloomberg ’ s options with his team .
In those conversations , Democratic operatives say , Bloomberg ’ s team members have indicated that they ’ re polling and conducting focus groups , and are familiar with the primary election calendar and the complicated politics of wringing delegates from various states . They ’ re also under no illusions about the difficulties of a Democratic Party newcomer running as a centrist in a progressive primary .
But Bloomberg ’ s aides are operating under the assumption that while the billionaire can ’ t buy the nomination , hundreds of millions of dollars can put him in contention .
“ Five hundred million is just an obscene amount of money . It ’ s crazy , enough to buy up all the TV ad inventory in the seven or eight states that really matter in a primary , ” said a Democratic consultant familiar with the plans who privately shared information from a conversation with a top Bloomberg adviser .
The consultant said it was unclear what Bloomberg would ultimately decide . But the mission would be similar either way .
“ They ’ re going to do the infrastructure and logistical work to fill in the gaps for the state and national parties so that whoever the nominee is would inherit a state-of-the-art , fully functioning infrastructure , ” the consultant said . “ It ’ s being done with a clear and specific purpose : stopping Donald Trump . ”
Bloomberg ’ s team knows the former mayor would need every penny to make his case to a Democratic electorate that ’ s shifting ever-leftward and that ’ s increasingly suspicious of billionaires and older white males .
Progressives also doubt his Democratic bona fides for having backed Republican candidates in the past , supporting the stop-and-frisk New York City policing policies that disproportionately targeted African-Americans and supporting gas and oil pipelines that leave some Democrats doubting his commitment to fight climate change — despite his commitment of $ 218 million to help cities reduce their carbon footprint while also financing the Sierra Club ’ s unprecedented Beyond Coal campaign that has shuttered 282 coal-fired electricity plants .
Though raised a Democrat , Bloomberg , 76 , was elected to the first of his three New York mayoral terms as a Republican , became an independent in 2007 before he left office in 2013 and registered last year as a Democrat .
But if Bloomberg runs , his polling would likely show there ’ s a path for a centrist in a field of progressives , who presumably would cannibalize the progressive base . Surveys from Bloomberg ’ s longtime pollster , Doug Schoen , shows that 80 percent of Democratic primary voters respond positively to Bloomberg ’ s biography .
“ When people learn about his involvement in climate change activism and gun safety , and when they learn that he ’ s not just a billionaire — but he came from a middle-class background and his dad never earned more than $ 6,000 a year , and you talk about the work he ’ s done on the ground and his philanthropy — Dem primary voters view him favorably , ” said one Democrat familiar with the polling .
With a net worth of $ 50 billion , Bloomberg contributed so much last year to charity — $ 767 million — that he was the nation ’ s second-biggest philanthropist behind Amazon founder Jeff Bezos . Bloomberg ’ s charitable causes also overlap top issues for the Democratic electorate , such as climate change and gun control .
His giving provides a ripe area for contrast : the Bloomberg Philanthropies ’ compared with the Donald J. Trump Foundation . Bloomberg ’ s charity has given away and pledged at least $ 8.2 billion to actual charities . Trump ’ s foundation agreed last year to dissolve amid an investigation from New York ’ s attorney general , who said it was “ functioning as little more than a checkbook to serve Mr. Trump ’ s business and political interests [ and engaged in ] a shocking pattern of illegality . ”
In a primary , Bloomberg ’ s deep pockets would enable an extended run with adequate resources , said Sheekey , a longtime political adviser .
“ The pressure for most people is two things : the need to raise money and the need to find the best and most-competitive staff , ” he said . “ Obviously , the first is not a problem for Mike and since we started this process , we ’ ve put together a core staff that we ’ re very happy with that is committed to staying with Mike as long as he wants , partly because Mike has talked about , if he doesn ’ t run , going down a separate path and having the kind of impact on a larger scale than he did in the last midterm . ”
Sheekey , who makes the case for Bloomberg for president better than Bloomberg himself , runs the weekly data-and-strategy meetings with Howard Wolfson , who oversaw Bloomberg ’ s political operation last year — when the former mayor contributed $ 110 million to 24 Democratic congressional candidates , 21 of whom won .
His top adviser at City Hall and the executive director of Bloomberg Philanthropies , Patti Harris , rounds out the inner circle ’ s troika .
A data-driven effort like the one the Bloomberg operation envisions , as first reported by the Atlantic , hearkens back to the roots of the billionaire ’ s wealth . A self-made man , he parlayed a small Wall Street fortune into a mammoth financial data and information services firm that branched out into a fully functioning media empire .
Yet Bloomberg has had what appears to be paralysis by analysis . He had planned to announce his decision on whether to run at the beginning of the month . But he needed more time and more numbers to decide by March — a date that ’ s still not set in stone .
“ The data , ” Sheekey said , “ is a little more complicated than what he initially envisioned . And I think he also realized he ’ s not under any pressure to decide . ”","Michael Bloomberg’s team knows the former New York City mayor would need every penny to make his case to a Democratic electorate. | Monica Schipper/Getty Images for Bloomberg Philanthropies 2020 elections Michael Bloomberg’s $500 million anti-Trump moonshot The sum represents a floor, not a ceiling, on the billionaire’s potential spending to defeat the president in 2020.

“That’ll get us through the first few months,” Kevin Sheekey, a top adviser to the former New York mayor, told POLITICO when asked about the $500 million plan, which is just 1 percent of Bloomberg’s estimated net worth.

“Mike spent $100 million in his last New York City election. And you can do the math as you think more broadly but New York City is 3 percent of the national population,” Sheekey said. “I’m not suggesting it’s straight math. But I’m suggesting that when Mike Bloomberg is committed to making a difference and seeing something though, generally speaking he’s pretty unabashed in doing so.”

To that end, Bloomberg has assembled a political team that, since late November, has been meeting at least once weekly in the Manhattan headquarters of Bloomberg Philanthropies to consider what some aides have called “Plan A” and “Plan B.”

Plan A is straightforward: Bloomberg runs for president as a Democrat, not as an independent candidate as he had mused privately in the past. According to Plan B, Bloomberg uses all the data — ranging from meticulously researched profiles of voters to polling data on the top issues that move the electorate — and field staff to help the otherwise-outgunned Democratic Party nominee to end Trump’s presidency.

Bloomberg said Friday at an event in Orlando, Fla., that he’ll make a decision in “ three more weeks .”

He also made clear that he’s not waiting on former Vice President Joe Biden, who’s also mulling a bid for president and who, Bloomberg advisers acknowledge, could draw from the same pool of moderate primary voters.

""My decision doesn't depend on what other people are going to do,"" Bloomberg told The Associated Press. ""My decision depends on whether or not I think I can make a difference.""

Still, the subject of Biden has come up in discussions with those who have discussed Bloomberg’s options with his team.

In those conversations, Democratic operatives say, Bloomberg’s team members have indicated that they’re polling and conducting focus groups, and are familiar with the primary election calendar and the complicated politics of wringing delegates from various states. They’re also under no illusions about the difficulties of a Democratic Party newcomer running as a centrist in a progressive primary.

But Bloomberg’s aides are operating under the assumption that while the billionaire can’t buy the nomination, hundreds of millions of dollars can put him in contention.

“Five hundred million is just an obscene amount of money. It’s crazy, enough to buy up all the TV ad inventory in the seven or eight states that really matter in a primary,” said a Democratic consultant familiar with the plans who privately shared information from a conversation with a top Bloomberg adviser.

The consultant said it was unclear what Bloomberg would ultimately decide. But the mission would be similar either way.

“They’re going to do the infrastructure and logistical work to fill in the gaps for the state and national parties so that whoever the nominee is would inherit a state-of-the-art, fully functioning infrastructure,” the consultant said. “It’s being done with a clear and specific purpose: stopping Donald Trump.”

Bloomberg’s team knows the former mayor would need every penny to make his case to a Democratic electorate that’s shifting ever-leftward and that’s increasingly suspicious of billionaires and older white males.

Progressives also doubt his Democratic bona fides for having backed Republican candidates in the past, supporting the stop-and-frisk New York City policing policies that disproportionately targeted African-Americans and supporting gas and oil pipelines that leave some Democrats doubting his commitment to fight climate change — despite his commitment of $218 million to help cities reduce their carbon footprint while also financing the Sierra Club’s unprecedented Beyond Coal campaign that has shuttered 282 coal-fired electricity plants.

Though raised a Democrat, Bloomberg, 76, was elected to the first of his three New York mayoral terms as a Republican, became an independent in 2007 before he left office in 2013 and registered last year as a Democrat.

But if Bloomberg runs, his polling would likely show there’s a path for a centrist in a field of progressives, who presumably would cannibalize the progressive base. Surveys from Bloomberg’s longtime pollster, Doug Schoen, shows that 80 percent of Democratic primary voters respond positively to Bloomberg’s biography.

“When people learn about his involvement in climate change activism and gun safety, and when they learn that he’s not just a billionaire — but he came from a middle-class background and his dad never earned more than $6,000 a year, and you talk about the work he’s done on the ground and his philanthropy — Dem primary voters view him favorably,” said one Democrat familiar with the polling.

With a net worth of $50 billion, Bloomberg contributed so much last year to charity — $767 million — that he was the nation’s second-biggest philanthropist behind Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Bloomberg’s charitable causes also overlap top issues for the Democratic electorate, such as climate change and gun control.

His giving provides a ripe area for contrast: the Bloomberg Philanthropies’ compared with the Donald J. Trump Foundation. Bloomberg’s charity has given away and pledged at least $8.2 billion to actual charities. Trump’s foundation agreed last year to dissolve amid an investigation from New York’s attorney general, who said it was “functioning as little more than a checkbook to serve Mr. Trump’s business and political interests [and engaged in] a shocking pattern of illegality.”

In a primary, Bloomberg’s deep pockets would enable an extended run with adequate resources, said Sheekey, a longtime political adviser.

“The pressure for most people is two things: the need to raise money and the need to find the best and most-competitive staff,” he said. “Obviously, the first is not a problem for Mike and since we started this process, we’ve put together a core staff that we’re very happy with that is committed to staying with Mike as long as he wants, partly because Mike has talked about, if he doesn’t run, going down a separate path and having the kind of impact on a larger scale than he did in the last midterm.”

Sheekey, who makes the case for Bloomberg for president better than Bloomberg himself, runs the weekly data-and-strategy meetings with Howard Wolfson, who oversaw Bloomberg’s political operation last year — when the former mayor contributed $110 million to 24 Democratic congressional candidates, 21 of whom won.

His top adviser at City Hall and the executive director of Bloomberg Philanthropies, Patti Harris, rounds out the inner circle’s troika.

A data-driven effort like the one the Bloomberg operation envisions, as first reported by the Atlantic, hearkens back to the roots of the billionaire’s wealth. A self-made man, he parlayed a small Wall Street fortune into a mammoth financial data and information services firm that branched out into a fully functioning media empire.

Yet Bloomberg has had what appears to be paralysis by analysis. He had planned to announce his decision on whether to run at the beginning of the month. But he needed more time and more numbers to decide by March — a date that’s still not set in stone.

“The data,” Sheekey said, “is a little more complicated than what he initially envisioned. And I think he also realized he’s not under any pressure to decide.”

How About 2,969,370 Campaign Ads",2014-10-29,Peter Over,"What Can $ 3.7 Billion Buy ? How About 2,969,370 Campaign Ads
Two new reports find that the House and Senate elections will cost about $ 3.7 billion — up just slightly from the past two election cycles — with outside groups buying their largest share yet of the television advertising .
The nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics , in Washington , says candidates and political parties are spending less this cycle , while outside groups are spending more . Its report does not include spending that outside groups do n't report to the Federal Election Commission . One prominent example is a months-long TV campaign against vulnerable Democratic senators by Americans for Prosperity , a 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) social welfare group backed by industrialists David and Charles Koch . It and other nonprofits are allowed to keep their donors ' names secret .
The Wesleyan Media Project , based at Wesleyan University in Connecticut , says next week 's election has generated fewer TV ads — down 12 percent from 2010 for the fall campaign — while ad spending is up . That paradox traces back to the changing balance in spending between candidates and outside groups . Federal law gives candidates access to lowest-rate airtime . Outside groups must pay top dollar .
Between the congressional races and the even more costly contests for governor , the Wesleyan analysis puts ad spending this cycle at nearly $ 1.2 billion so far .
The most intense Senate races are in North Carolina and Iowa .

Two new reports find that the House and Senate elections will cost about $3.7 billion — up just slightly from the past two election cycles — with outside groups buying their largest share yet of the television advertising.

The nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, in Washington, says candidates and political parties are spending less this cycle, while outside groups are spending more. Its report does not include spending that outside groups don't report to the Federal Election Commission. One prominent example is a months-long TV campaign against vulnerable Democratic senators by Americans for Prosperity, a 501(c)(4) social welfare group backed by industrialists David and Charles Koch. It and other nonprofits are allowed to keep their donors' names secret.

The Wesleyan Media Project, based at Wesleyan University in Connecticut, says next week's election has generated fewer TV ads — down 12 percent from 2010 for the fall campaign — while ad spending is up. That paradox traces back to the changing balance in spending between candidates and outside groups. Federal law gives candidates access to lowest-rate airtime. Outside groups must pay top dollar.

Between the congressional races and the even more costly contests for governor, the Wesleyan analysis puts ad spending this cycle at nearly $1.2 billion so far.

The most intense Senate races are in North Carolina and Iowa.

Democratic presidential primary endorsements actually matter a lot

There's room to argue over the exact value of most political endorsements — and there's a good case to be made that the vast majority are pretty meaningless — but presidential primary endorsements, particularly on the Democratic side, can matter a lot.

There are three basic reasons for that:

Members of Congress, governors, and certain other party officials are ""superdelegates"" to the Democratic National Convention next year, meaning they have a vote in the tally that decides the nomination and that they aren't pledged to vote for a candidate chosen by the voters of their state or district. Elected officials often — though not always — have pretty significant political organizations and fundraising networks. They can help a presidential candidate put together a ground game on their home turf and squeeze every last dollar out of of every last donor. This is particularly true of top statewide elected officials such as governors and US senators.

The policy differences between candidates in a party primary can be pretty small, and some voters may take cues from their favorite local pols to pick a candidate for the nomination. The endorsement of a popular official confers a certain credibility on a candidate.

There's another reason that the spate of endorsements is a big deal for Clinton. She's reducing the number of big-name Democrats available as validators for Biden as he deliberates over a run. That's not going to be the deciding factor for him, but, just as he's looking for fundraisers to fill his coffers, you can be sure he's also keeping tabs on who is still open to lending their name and political operation to him.

Clinton is dominant on Capitol Hill

Sanders has been in Congress for almost a quarter of a century, and Biden's been a senator or president of the Senate (one of his roles as vice president) since 1973. But Clinton, who was only a senator for eight years, has vacuumed up support from House and Senate Democrats.

That's attributable to a potent mix of genuine support, fear of being on the wrong side of a Clinton team with a long memory, and the self-interested belief that Clinton would be more attentive to the care and feeding of lawmakers than Obama has been.

She earned high praise from House Democrats after a private meeting this summer when she drew a subtle but unmistakable stylistic contrast with Obama.

Claire McCaskill — have written personal checks to her. Among Clinton loyalists, McCaskill was the most hated of Obama's surrogates in 2008.

The politics of inclusion

While Democratic lawmakers make for a good focus group, they're hardly the whole story. Clinton is assiduously courting key constituencies by including them in the development of her platform, aiming policies directly at them, and building a campaign operation that clearly reflects the full diversity of the Democratic Party.

It's tough to bash Clinton when you're sitting at her table

Clinton's painstakingly built institutional support. Here's her secret: Invite potential adversaries to the table, include some of their ideas in policy, and then send their laudatory remarks out to reporters.

Her campaign reflects the Democratic Party and its priorities

When advocacy groups are upset with policy, they often point to a lack of representation within a candidate or president's inner circle. When they want to enhance their representation, they often argue that policy decisions aren't being resolved in their favor. It will be tougher to criticize Clinton because she's covering both bases. The composition of her staff and the composition of her platform reinforce each other.

Clinton has a corner on the top talent in the market for Democratic operatives, including people of color, which has made it more difficult for Sanders, O'Malley and others to staff up. It also limits Biden's options in terms of building a top-notch campaign operation.

Clinton's also done an interesting thing with her top operatives that helps her show the diversity of her staff: She's building their brands. One of the effects of that is to make the face of the campaign more of a mosaic and more representative of the party's constituencies.

campaign_finance,Mother Jones,0,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/08/political-campaigns-are-pitching-donor-match-programs-that-might-not-exist/,Political Campaigns Are Pitching Donor-Match Programs That Might Not Exist,,Russ Choma,"As the Democratic presidential candidates wound down their second debate in Detroit last month , Donald Trump ’ s fundraising committee blasted out an email decrying the “ socialist circus ” with a tempting offer to supporters of the president .
“ Our biggest fundraising deadline of the year is just 3 hours away , and we are still well short of our goal . This is so important that all contributions will be TRIPLE-MATCHED until MIDNIGHT TONIGHT , ” the email promised . “ Contribute before 11:59 PM TONIGHT to help us CRUSH our July fundraising goal and your contribution will be 3X MATCHED . ”
The thing is , this matching program may not actually exist . Yet this has become an increasingly popular , if deceptive , fundraising ploy used by candidates on both sides of the aisle .
In the nonprofit fundraising world , offers of a big donor “ matching ” smaller contributions as a way to incentivize more giving are routine . But this tactic doesn ’ t translate well to political campaigns , which are governed by different rules , including laws strictly limiting how much a donor can give in an election . That means , despite what a fundraising email may say , there may not be a real matching donation program if it ’ s a political candidate making the pitch . The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment on its email pitch .
There are exceptions . Super-PACs , for instance , can take as much money as they want from a donor making a match program more feasible , and a candidate could personally match donor contributions if the candidate chooses . But the reason why matching donor appeals are not realistic for campaigns is because the most that any individual can give is $ 2,800 for the primary and $ 2,800 for the general election , a total of $ 5,600 in the two-year run-up to a federal election . Given the contribution limits , the logistics of a matching donor program are tricky .
“ If a single individual responds with a $ 2,800 contribution , it is possible there is another wealthy donor who has not yet made a $ 2,800 donation , who could match it , but then the donor is done and can ’ t match a single other donation , ” says Paul S. Ryan , vice president of policy and litigation at Common Cause , a liberal watchdog group . “ That ’ s why as a general matter the scheme doesn ’ t work . ”
Trump isn ’ t alone in offering some type of “ match ” scheme . Three Democratic candidates have recently circulated similar fundraising appeals : Cory Booker , Julián Castro , and Seth Moulton .
An email sent on May 28 by the Castro campaign and signed by the candidate ’ s brother , Joaquin , implores recipients to take up a matching offer : “ My brother ’ s campaign still needs $ 201,092 before the End of Month Deadline in 72 hours . Thankfully , a group of generous donors have agreed to match all gifts for the first time in this campaign . Will you rush in $ 23 before this critical deadline ? It will be matched. ” Reaching this goal would require lining up a minimum of 18 matching donors who had yet to donate to the campaign and were willing to contribute the maximum . Castro ’ s campaign filings show that in the three days between when the campaign made its appeal and the end of the month deadline , only one donor contributed $ 2,800 .
The Castro campaign did not respond to a request for comment .
Emails from Moulton and Booker offer more plausible but limited versions of a matching scheme . A June 19 fundraising email circulated by the Moulton campaign explains that two donors have agreed to match the first $ 10,000 donated—theoretically , this is possible given the maximum two donors could give the campaign over the entire election cycle is $ 11,200 . That said , in the Moulton campaign ’ s most recent campaign finance filing to the Federal Election Commission , the campaign reported only one donor having given $ 5,600 ( the maximum amount ) to the campaign after June 19 , suggesting that the $ 10,000 match was not made—and that subsequent Moulton emails in the following days describing additional donors willing to match donations up to $ 10,000 were not necessarily true . Two other donations of over $ 5,000 were made through ActBlue . The Moulton campaign did not respond to requests for comment .
A Booker campaign fundraising email from July 26 describes a much more feasible scheme—but also one that doesn ’ t seem designed to raise a large amount of money . The email says Booker needs 130,000 unique donors to qualify for the Democratic National Committee ’ s debates in the fall . The email claims that a group of founding donors agreed to match the first 12,636 first-time donors who make a donation of $ 1 . In other words , just three donors could match all of the donations—not a viable way to raise big money , but perhaps a good strategy to expand the number of individual donors contributing to Booker ’ s campaign .
Ryan and other campaign finance attorneys said there is nothing in election law that prohibits campaigns from pitching deceptive matching donor schemes .

Dan Backer , a conservative campaign and election law attorney , says he thinks it is unlikely that anyone is actually going to be pursued for fraud over the matching schemes because candidates are given wide latitude over how truthful their political statements must be . But he says he ’ s not a fan of the tactic and advises his clients , which include both super-PACs and more tightly regulated committees , to devise a real matching program if they ’ re going to pitch one in fundraising appeals .
“ We make a point that you really do have to have that mechanism , ” he says . “ I have a hard time believing that ’ s the case in the rest of the industry . How do you do that , if you ’ re a traditional campaign ? ”
Backer says he ’ s seen the matching tactic used more and more in recent years . “ I think people just use it because it ’ s a tactic that works , ” he says , noting that in most cases there is no actual matching donor program . “ I think it ’ s a little shameful , but I don ’ t think anyone is going to get prosecuted for it . ”","As the Democratic presidential candidates wound down their second debate in Detroit last month, Donald Trump’s fundraising committee blasted out an email decrying the “socialist circus” with a tempting offer to supporters of the president.

“Our biggest fundraising deadline of the year is just 3 hours away, and we are still well short of our goal. This is so important that all contributions will be TRIPLE-MATCHED until MIDNIGHT TONIGHT,” the email promised. “Contribute before 11:59 PM TONIGHT to help us CRUSH our July fundraising goal and your contribution will be 3X MATCHED.”

The thing is, this matching program may not actually exist. Yet this has become an increasingly popular, if deceptive, fundraising ploy used by candidates on both sides of the aisle.

In the nonprofit fundraising world, offers of a big donor “matching” smaller contributions as a way to incentivize more giving are routine. But this tactic doesn’t translate well to political campaigns, which are governed by different rules, including laws strictly limiting how much a donor can give in an election. That means, despite what a fundraising email may say, there may not be a real matching donation program if it’s a political candidate making the pitch. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment on its email pitch.

There are exceptions. Super-PACs, for instance, can take as much money as they want from a donor making a match program more feasible, and a candidate could personally match donor contributions if the candidate chooses. But the reason why matching donor appeals are not realistic for campaigns is because the most that any individual can give is $2,800 for the primary and $2,800 for the general election, a total of $5,600 in the two-year run-up to a federal election. Given the contribution limits, the logistics of a matching donor program are tricky.

“If a single individual responds with a $2,800 contribution, it is possible there is another wealthy donor who has not yet made a $2,800 donation, who could match it, but then the donor is done and can’t match a single other donation,” says Paul S. Ryan, vice president of policy and litigation at Common Cause, a liberal watchdog group. “That’s why as a general matter the scheme doesn’t work.”

Trump isn’t alone in offering some type of “match” scheme. Three Democratic candidates have recently circulated similar fundraising appeals: Cory Booker, Julián Castro, and Seth Moulton.

An email sent on May 28 by the Castro campaign and signed by the candidate’s brother, Joaquin, implores recipients to take up a matching offer: “My brother’s campaign still needs $201,092 before the End of Month Deadline in 72 hours. Thankfully, a group of generous donors have agreed to match all gifts for the first time in this campaign. Will you rush in $23 before this critical deadline? It will be matched.” Reaching this goal would require lining up a minimum of 18 matching donors who had yet to donate to the campaign and were willing to contribute the maximum. Castro’s campaign filings show that in the three days between when the campaign made its appeal and the end of the month deadline, only one donor contributed $2,800.

The Castro campaign did not respond to a request for comment.

Emails from Moulton and Booker offer more plausible but limited versions of a matching scheme. A June 19 fundraising email circulated by the Moulton campaign explains that two donors have agreed to match the first $10,000 donated—theoretically, this is possible given the maximum two donors could give the campaign over the entire election cycle is $11,200. That said, in the Moulton campaign’s most recent campaign finance filing to the Federal Election Commission, the campaign reported only one donor having given $5,600 (the maximum amount) to the campaign after June 19, suggesting that the $10,000 match was not made—and that subsequent Moulton emails in the following days describing additional donors willing to match donations up to $10,000 were not necessarily true. Two other donations of over $5,000 were made through ActBlue. The Moulton campaign did not respond to requests for comment.

A Booker campaign fundraising email from July 26 describes a much more feasible scheme—but also one that doesn’t seem designed to raise a large amount of money. The email says Booker needs 130,000 unique donors to qualify for the Democratic National Committee’s debates in the fall.

In other words, just three donors could match all of the donations—not a viable way to raise big money, but perhaps a good strategy to expand the number of individual donors contributing to Booker’s campaign.

But it could violate other laws. “The Federal Election Campaign Act doesn’t address it,” says one Republican election law attorney who does not represent any presidential candidates but asked not to be named because other clients of his use the matching donor tactic. “If I was worried about a Democrat doing this kind of email I think you could make consumer fraud problems.”

campaign_finance,Politico,0,http://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/top-political-donors-113833.html,Big money breaks out,2014-12-29,Kenneth P. Vogel,"The 100 biggest campaign donors gave $ 323 million in 2014 — almost as much as the $ 356 million given by the estimated 4.75 million people who gave $ 200 or less , a ███ analysis of campaign finance filings found .
And the balance almost certainly would tip far in favor of the mega-donors were the analysis to include nonprofit groups that spent at least $ 219 million — and likely much more — but aren ’ t required to reveal their donors ’ identities .
The numbers — gleaned from reports filed with the Federal Election Commission and the Internal Revenue Service — paint the most comprehensive picture to date of an electoral landscape in which the financial balance has tilted dramatically to the ultra-rich . They have taken advantage of a spate of recent federal court rulings , regulatory decisions and feeble or bumbling oversight to spend ever-greater sums in politics — sometimes raising questions about whether their bounty is being well spent . Yet their expanded giving power in 2014 was all the more stark , coming against a backdrop of what appears to be a surprising decline in the number of regular Americans contributing to campaigns , as well as a shift in political power and money to outside groups unburdened by the contribution restrictions handcuffing the political parties and their candidates .
Taken together , the trend lines reflect a new political reality in which a handful of superaffluent partisans can exert more sway over the campaign landscape than millions of donors of more average means . And that ’ s to say nothing of the overwhelming majority of voters who never spend so much as a single dime on politics . ( The Center for Responsive Politics estimates that only 0.28 percent of American adults donate to campaigns . )
The widening imbalance revealed by ███ ’ s analysis illustrates “ the insanity of this system ” and is further discouragement to would-be small donors , asserted Larry Lessig , a Harvard professor who this year helped launch a self-described “ crowdfunded ” super PAC . Called Mayday PAC , it spent $ 10.6 million from a mix of micro- and mega-donors on a quixotic crusade to elect congressional candidates who it hoped would support policies that empower mom and pop contributors .
“ As you see that your democracy is controlled by a smaller and smaller number of funders , you have less and less interest to be engaged in it , ” said Lessig .
Yet the power of the ultra-rich was also ironically highlighted by Mayday ’ s own fundraising . It yielded a total of $ 3 million from just seven donors , most of whom made ███ ’ s top 100 list — LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman ( who ranked No . 64 , gave $ 1 million to Mayday and another $ 60,000 to various Democratic and liberal committees ) , Napster co-founder Sean Parker ( No . 43 ; $ 500,000 to Mayday and $ 1.1 million to a mix of liberal and conservative committees ) , Boston investor Vin Ryan ( No . 70 ; $ 500,000 to Mayday and $ 400,000 to liberal candidates and groups ) , billionaire heiress Pat Stryker ( No . 52 ; $ 300,000 to Mayday and $ 1 million to liberals ) and retired shoe executive Arnold Hiatt ( No . 98 ; $ 250,000 to Mayday and $ 500,000 to liberals ) .
In the end , Mayday PAC suffered embarrassing disappointment in 2014 , winning only two out of eight races in which it played . “ Obviously , 2014 makes it hard to be optimistic about it in any immediate term , ” Lessig said , “ but the democracy fails unless we change this system , so I am confident that eventually we ’ ll figure out how to make this change happen . ”
Top conservative donors and their representatives dismissed liberal concerns about the expansion of big money in politics as hypocritical and lacking in context . More than twice as much money was spent on Halloween this year — $ 7.4 billion — as on federal elections — $ 3.67 billion — one donor representative pointed out .
And Ronnie Cameron , an Arkansas poultry company owner who ranked 13th on ███ ’ s list , asserted that , while he and his fellow mega-donors may be writing bigger checks these days , it hasn ’ t fundamentally changed American politics .
“ I doubt the amount of influence is any more concentrated in the hand of a few than it was in the 1950s or 1960s , ” said Cameron . He donated $ 4.2 million between his company Mountaire Corp. and his personal checkbook to GOP-allied candidates and groups , ranging from maximum $ 5,200 donations to successful Senate candidates Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Joni Ernst of Iowa to $ 1.3 million worth of checks to the Republican Governors Association to $ 2 million to Freedom Partners Action Fund , the super PAC affiliated with the Koch brothers ’ political operation . “ There have always been wealthy individuals that had influence , ” Cameron pointed out , adding , “ Our country was founded by the wealthy landowners having the authority and representing all the people . ”
Faulting ███ for omitting contributions from labor unions , which lean left , in its analysis ( though it also omitted contributions from most major corporations , which tend to lean right ) , Cameron asserted that wealthy conservative donors — even at their most potent — would only offset the liberal tendencies of influential institutions . “ Between Hollywood , the media and the unions , their huge influence by a relative few has long exceeded the influence paid for by people able and willing to give personal money to deliver a message . ”
███ ’ s analysis relies on FEC data processed by the Center for Responsive Politics ( a nonpartisan nonprofit group ) , supplemented by IRS data aggregated and made available for searching by Political Moneyline , covering donations made during the 2014 cycle , including reports filed this month that detail contributions through the final days of the race . The analysis incorporates checks written by donors , their spouses and closely controlled corporations to federal candidates ’ campaigns and national party committees , as well as to political action committees and super PACs registered with the FEC , and to national nonprofit groups established under a section of the Tax Code — 527 — that allows organizations like the Democratic and Republican governors associations and the abortion-rights group EMILY ’ s List to raise unlimited contributions , provided they disclose their donors to the IRS .
The analysis does not include donations to state-level campaigns and political committees , nor , importantly , does it include an increasingly significant subset of national political groups registered under a section of the Tax Code — 501 ( c ) — that doesn ’ t require them to disclose their donors . Those groups reported to the FEC that they spent at least $ 219 million in the midterms , with conservative groups accounting for 69 percent of that , according to CRP . But the groups , which are popular with conservative donors who have expressed concerns about being targeted for their donations , almost certainly spent much more than on political expenses that don ’ t trigger reporting requirements . A single 501 ( c ) group , the Koch brothers-backed Americans for Prosperity , spent around $ 125 million in 2014 .
Wealthy liberals , meanwhile , had initially expressed philosophical opposition to all forms of big-money political spending after the Supreme Court ’ s 2010 Citizens United decision opened the floodgates . Not only did they substantially trail conservatives in big-money spending during the first two elections of the new era , but they also tried — with little apparent success — to make the billionaire conservative mega-donors Charles and David Koch into campaign bogeymenboogeymen .
███ ’ s analysis of top 2014 donors suggests that liberals have gotten over their big-money qualms .
Donors who gave exclusively or primarily to Democratic candidates and groups held down 52 of the top 100 spots — including by far the biggest donor of disclosed 2014 cash : retired San Francisco hedge fund billionaire Tom Steyer .
He donated more than $ 74 million to Democratic candidates and supportive committees , but it was the way he gave that highlighted both the potential impact and the limitations of the new breed of mega-donor to shape elections .
Like a handful of the top 100 donors , Steyer spent the majority of his political cash — $ 66.9 million — through a super PAC he created and funded to pursue his main issue : elevating climate change in the political debate . Yet the PAC , NextGen Climate Action , won only three of the seven races in which it spent cash , prompting grumbling from ostensible allies that he may have overestimated voters ’ — and his fellow liberal donors ’ — interest in the issue , and that he misspent his cash on sometimes bizarre ads accusing Republican candidates of being beholden to Big Oil and challenging the Koch brothers , whose multinational industrial conglomerate includes a substantial fossil fuel portfolio , to a debate on climate change .
In a post-election statement , Steyer cast his 2014 spending spree , which amounted to exponentially more than he ’ d ever spent in politics , as a learning experience , and forecast another major outlay in 2016 . Declaring “ this is only the beginning , ” he said , “ I may be new to politics , but there ’ s one thing I know — investing in democracy is , without question , a winning proposition . ”
The second biggest donor , billionaire former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg , also spent much of his cash — about half of his $ 27.7 million total — through his own PAC , Independence USA PAC . And , like Steyer , Bloomberg had mixed results that raised questions about the effectiveness of his strategy , which sometimes seemed in conflict with itself . For instance , in the campaign ’ s final month , Bloomberg , whose fortune stems from his eponymous media and data company , donated $ 1.25 million to the RGA and $ 1.6 million to the DGA .
Bloomberg concluded he got much more bang for his buck on his animating causes — gun control , healthier food choices and education reform — by directing his cash away from the national level . “ Change is really possible at the state and local level , ” he told ███ after the election .

Meanwhile , the smaller money , a category Republicans won in the last midterm cycle , swung to favor Democrats in 2014 . When micro-contributions of $ 200 or less were tallied through Oct. 15 — the period covered by the most recent FEC reports that CRP had comprehensively analyzed — Democrats were outraising Republicans by a total of $ 205.3 million to $ 150.7 million .
Campaigns aren ’ t required to disclose the names or precise amounts of donations that fall short of the $ 200 threshold , so it ’ s impossible to know with certainty how many donors accounted for that haul . But the Campaign Finance Institute estimates that the average so-called unitemized donor gives $ 75 , which would mean that roughly 4.75 million donors combined to give the $ 356 million donated through mid-October .
Of course , the final number of small donors will increase — perhaps significantly — when the final three weeks ’ worth of contributions are tallied . But that will be offset at least partially by the number of donors whose aggregate contributions to a committee will cross the $ 200 threshold — moving them from the category of unitemized micro-donors into the mid-size donor tier .
When all the donations are tallied and analyzed , 2014 is likely to be noteworthy for two other milestones on the opposite end of the spectrum from the growth of mega-donations : It ’ s on pace to be the first midterm election since 1990 — the earliest cycle for which CRP performed such an analysis — in which the overall number of traceable donations declined . Through late October , there were 666,773 individual donors who had given more than $ 200 , as compared to the 817,464 who gave during 2010 , according to CRP . It ’ s also likely to be the first midterm since 1990 when the candidates ’ campaigns spent less than in the preceding midterm election .
The decline in candidate spending , though , is more than offset by the increase in spending by super PACs and other groups that can accept huge contributions from the ultra-rich . The trajectory is pointing to a heyday of mega-donors , asserted GOP consultant Mark McKinnon , who co-founded Mayday with Lessig .
“ When 100 big donors give as much almost 5 million small donors , with whom do we expect candidates to spend their time , and whose interests do we think they will represent ? ” McKinnon asked . “ That ’ s not democracy . That ’ s oligarchy . ”
Don ’ t write the obituary for small donors just yet , though , cautioned California vintner John Jordan , whose $ 2.4 million in 2014 donations supporting conservatives ranked him 28th on ███ ’ s top donor list .
“ Small donor activity is probably the best leading indicator for voter intensity in your own party , ” he said . “ A fired-up activist is going to talk to friends and neighbors , is going to post on Facebook , is going to volunteer at the campaign . So a small donor ’ s value is really much greater than a small contribution , ” said Jordan .
On the other side of the spectrum , plenty of wealthy donors in recent years have gotten questionable returns on their donations , asserted Jordan , who last year started his own PAC ( to which he donated $ 1.7 million ) after questioning the effectiveness of bigger GOP-allied super PACs like Karl Rove ’ s American Crossroads , to which he had been a donor in 2012 .
“ I ’ ve seen a lot of people write a lot of big checks to a lot of big super PACs and achieve absolutely nothing . And I ’ ve seen a group of small grass-roots donors like the tea party just kind of rear up out of nowhere and , if the time and place is right , have enormous influence , ” he said . “ Money is always going to be in politics , and it always has been . All money buys is the candidate ’ s ability to make their case . ”","The 100 biggest campaign donors gave $323 million in 2014 — almost as much as the $356 million given by the estimated 4.75 million people who gave $200 or less, a POLITICO analysis of campaign finance filings found.

And the balance almost certainly would tip far in favor of the mega-donors were the analysis to include nonprofit groups that spent at least $219 million — and likely much more — but aren’t required to reveal their donors’ identities.

In the end, Mayday PAC suffered embarrassing disappointment in 2014, winning only two out of eight races in which it played. “Obviously, 2014 makes it hard to be optimistic about it in any immediate term,” Lessig said, “but the democracy fails unless we change this system, so I am confident that eventually we’ll figure out how to make this change happen.”

Top conservative donors and their representatives dismissed liberal concerns about the expansion of big money in politics as hypocritical and lacking in context. More than twice as much money was spent on Halloween this year — $7.4 billion — as on federal elections — $3.67 billion — one donor representative pointed out.

And Ronnie Cameron, an Arkansas poultry company owner who ranked 13th on POLITICO’s list, asserted that, while he and his fellow mega-donors may be writing bigger checks these days, it hasn’t fundamentally changed American politics.

“I doubt the amount of influence is any more concentrated in the hand of a few than it was in the 1950s or 1960s,” said Cameron. He donated $4.2 million between his company Mountaire Corp. and his personal checkbook to GOP-allied candidates and groups, ranging from maximum $5,200 donations to successful Senate candidates Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Joni Ernst of Iowa to $1.3 million worth of checks to the Republican Governors Association to $2 million to Freedom Partners Action Fund, the super PAC affiliated with the Koch brothers’ political operation. “There have always been wealthy individuals that had influence,” Cameron pointed out, adding, “Our country was founded by the wealthy landowners having the authority and representing all the people.”

Faulting POLITICO for omitting contributions from labor unions, which lean left, in its analysis (though it also omitted contributions from most major corporations, which tend to lean right), Cameron asserted that wealthy conservative donors — even at their most potent — would only offset the liberal tendencies of influential institutions. “Between Hollywood, the media and the unions, their huge influence by a relative few has long exceeded the influence paid for by people able and willing to give personal money to deliver a message.”

POLITICO’s analysis relies on FEC data processed by the Center for Responsive Politics (a nonpartisan nonprofit group), supplemented by IRS data aggregated and made available for searching by Political Moneyline, covering donations made during the 2014 cycle, including reports filed this month that detail contributions through the final days of the race. The analysis incorporates checks written by donors, their spouses and closely controlled corporations to federal candidates’ campaigns and national party committees, as well as to political action committees and super PACs registered with the FEC, and to national nonprofit groups established under a section of the Tax Code — 527 — that allows organizations like the Democratic and Republican governors associations and the abortion-rights group EMILY’s List to raise unlimited contributions, provided they disclose their donors to the IRS.

The analysis does not include donations to state-level campaigns and political committees, nor, importantly, does it include an increasingly significant subset of national political groups registered under a section of the Tax Code — 501(c) — that doesn’t require them to disclose their donors. Those groups reported to the FEC that they spent at least $219 million in the midterms, with conservative groups accounting for 69 percent of that, according to CRP. But the groups, which are popular with conservative donors who have expressed concerns about being targeted for their donations, almost certainly spent much more than on political expenses that don’t trigger reporting requirements. A single 501(c) group, the Koch brothers-backed Americans for Prosperity, spent around $125 million in 2014.

Wealthy liberals, meanwhile, had initially expressed philosophical opposition to all forms of big-money political spending after the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision opened the floodgates. Not only did they substantially trail conservatives in big-money spending during the first two elections of the new era, but they also tried — with little apparent success — to make the billionaire conservative mega-donors Charles and David Koch into campaign bogeymenboogeymen.

POLITICO’s analysis of top 2014 donors suggests that liberals have gotten over their big-money qualms.

Donors who gave exclusively or primarily to Democratic candidates and groups held down 52 of the top 100 spots — including by far the biggest donor of disclosed 2014 cash: retired San Francisco hedge fund billionaire Tom Steyer.

He donated more than $74 million to Democratic candidates and supportive committees, but it was the way he gave that highlighted both the potential impact and the limitations of the new breed of mega-donor to shape elections.

Like a handful of the top 100 donors, Steyer spent the majority of his political cash — $66.9 million — through a super PAC he created and funded to pursue his main issue: elevating climate change in the political debate. Yet the PAC, NextGen Climate Action, won only three of the seven races in which it spent cash, prompting grumbling from ostensible allies that he may have overestimated voters’ — and his fellow liberal donors’ — interest in the issue, and that he misspent his cash on sometimes bizarre ads accusing Republican candidates of being beholden to Big Oil and challenging the Koch brothers, whose multinational industrial conglomerate includes a substantial fossil fuel portfolio, to a debate on climate change.

In a post-election statement, Steyer cast his 2014 spending spree, which amounted to exponentially more than he’d ever spent in politics, as a learning experience, and forecast another major outlay in 2016. Declaring “this is only the beginning,” he said, “I may be new to politics, but there’s one thing I know — investing in democracy is, without question, a winning proposition.”

The second biggest donor, billionaire former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, also spent much of his cash — about half of his $27.7 million total — through his own PAC, Independence USA PAC. And, like Steyer, Bloomberg had mixed results that raised questions about the effectiveness of his strategy, which sometimes seemed in conflict with itself. For instance, in the campaign’s final month, Bloomberg, whose fortune stems from his eponymous media and data company, donated $1.25 million to the RGA and $1.6 million to the DGA.

Bloomberg concluded he got much more bang for his buck on his animating causes — gun control, healthier food choices and education reform — by directing his cash away from the national level. “Change is really possible at the state and local level,” he told POLITICO after the election.

Meanwhile, the smaller money, a category Republicans won in the last midterm cycle, swung to favor Democrats in 2014. When micro-contributions of $200 or less were tallied through Oct. 15 — the period covered by the most recent FEC reports that CRP had comprehensively analyzed — Democrats were outraising Republicans by a total of $205.3 million to $150.7 million.

Campaigns aren’t required to disclose the names or precise amounts of donations that fall short of the $200 threshold, so it’s impossible to know with certainty how many donors accounted for that haul. But the Campaign Finance Institute estimates that the average so-called unitemized donor gives $75, which would mean that roughly 4.75 million donors combined to give the $356 million donated through mid-October.

Of course, the final number of small donors will increase — perhaps significantly — when the final three weeks’ worth of contributions are tallied. But that will be offset at least partially by the number of donors whose aggregate contributions to a committee will cross the $200 threshold — moving them from the category of unitemized micro-donors into the mid-size donor tier.

When all the donations are tallied and analyzed, 2014 is likely to be noteworthy for two other milestones on the opposite end of the spectrum from the growth of mega-donations: It’s on pace to be the first midterm election since 1990 — the earliest cycle for which CRP performed such an analysis — in which the overall number of traceable donations declined. Through late October, there were 666,773 individual donors who had given more than $200, as compared to the 817,464 who gave during 2010, according to CRP. It’s also likely to be the first midterm since 1990 when the candidates’ campaigns spent less than in the preceding midterm election.

The decline in candidate spending, though, is more than offset by the increase in spending by super PACs and other groups that can accept huge contributions from the ultra-rich. The trajectory is pointing to a heyday of mega-donors, asserted GOP consultant Mark McKinnon, who co-founded Mayday with Lessig.

“When 100 big donors give as much almost 5 million small donors, with whom do we expect candidates to spend their time, and whose interests do we think they will represent?” McKinnon asked. “That’s not democracy. That’s oligarchy.”

Don’t write the obituary for small donors just yet, though, cautioned California vintner John Jordan, whose $2.4 million in 2014 donations supporting conservatives ranked him 28th on POLITICO’s top donor list.

“Small donor activity is probably the best leading indicator for voter intensity in your own party,” he said. “A fired-up activist is going to talk to friends and neighbors, is going to post on Facebook, is going to volunteer at the campaign. So a small donor’s value is really much greater than a small contribution,” said Jordan.

On the other side of the spectrum, plenty of wealthy donors in recent years have gotten questionable returns on their donations, asserted Jordan, who last year started his own PAC (to which he donated $1.7 million) after questioning the effectiveness of bigger GOP-allied super PACs like Karl Rove’s American Crossroads, to which he had been a donor in 2012.

“I’ve seen a lot of people write a lot of big checks to a lot of big super PACs and achieve absolutely nothing. And I’ve seen a group of small grass-roots donors like the tea party just kind of rear up out of nowhere and, if the time and place is right, have enormous influence,” he said. “Money is always going to be in politics, and it always has been. All money buys is the candidate’s ability to make their case.”",www.politico.com,left,571SLk7PnjJNOKV1

The data comes from Facebook and includes ads on both Facebook and Instagram .
Mr. Trump spent particularly heavily on Facebook ads at the beginning of the year , when the number of Democratic candidates was smaller . But the playing field has shifted .
Since entering the race late last month , former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has pumped more than $ 1 million into Facebook ads , outspending Mr. Trump ’ s campaign for three of the past four weeks .
So far this year , Mr. Trump has spent about $ 5 million on Facebook advertising . Early in the year , Mr. Trump ’ s Facebook spending exceeded that of all of the Democratic candidates put together , though Democrats ’ collective spending eventually surpassed Mr. Trump ’ s total .
“ For a long time , Trump was running an intensive campaign that no one was paying attention to , ” said Mike Schneider , a partner at Bully Pulpit Interactive , a Democratic political and brand communications firm that is tracking Facebook spending by the presidential candidates .
“ And while Democrats have picked up their efforts , they ’ re fighting over the same group of supporters while he ’ s broadly expanding his base , ” Mr. Schneider said .
Much of Mr. Trump ’ s spending on Facebook advertising in recent weeks has gone toward ads that have been seen by older Americans , particularly women 55 and older , according to an analysis by Bully Pulpit .

Older voters are an important constituency for Mr. Trump , having favored him over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election , according to exit polls . Mr. Trump also has reason to want to shore up his standing with women , as white women shifted leftward in the midterm elections .
Mr. Trump can pour millions into Facebook advertising because he has a big fund-raising head start over even the best-funded Democratic candidates . He ended the first quarter of the year with about $ 41 million in cash on hand , far more than the leading Democratic fund-raiser , Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont .
The Trump campaign received widespread attention for its aggressive use of Facebook in the 2016 election .
In interviews after the 2016 victory , Brad Parscale , who was the campaign ’ s digital director , described how the Trump campaign sought to make the most of Facebook to reach prospective supporters . Facebook ads make it possible to reach places “ that you would never go with TV ads , ” Mr. Parscale said in a 2017 interview on “ 60 Minutes . ”
To maximize the effectiveness of its advertising , the Trump campaign used tens of thousands of different ad variations on any given day , said Mr. Parscale , who is now managing Mr. Trump ’ s re-election bid .
“ Changing language , words , colors , changing things because certain people like a green button better than a blue button , ” he said . “ Some people like the word ‘ donate ’ over ‘ contribute . ’ ”
Campaign officials say that their strategy will expand upon what they did in 2016 , not only with Facebook but with other online platforms where voters are consuming news as well . The campaign has found that voters it wants to target are also spending a significant amount of time getting information on YouTube , according to an official .
The campaign anticipates spending hundreds of millions of dollars on its online strategy for the 2020 election , officials said .
Many of the Trump campaign ’ s ads on Facebook are designed to get users to provide their contact information and expand the size of the campaign ’ s already enormous list of supporters . Others solicit donations or peddle Trump merchandise .
“ Facebook ads are a really valuable source for building your email list , and the more emails you have on your list , the more money you ’ re going to raise online , ” said Eric Wilson , a Republican digital strategist . “ There ’ s a direct through line to resources for the campaign . ”
Recently , the Trump campaign has spent heavily on one subject in particular : the president ’ s birthday .
Mr. Trump turns 73 next month , and his campaign has run an assortment of ads asking people to sign a birthday card for him . The ads vary in their words and visuals . Some show a young man in a party hat being embraced by friends bearing gifts and balloons ; others show a woman holding a birthday cake , candles ablaze . Still more just show Mr. Trump .
Curiously , many of the ads say , incorrectly , that he will be turning 72 .

Other Trump ads have asked people to sign a birthday card for the first lady , Melania Trump , whose birthday was last month .
Over five weeks , Mr. Trump spent an estimated $ 450,000 on birthday ads on Facebook , accounting for slightly more than half of his Facebook spending during that time , according to Bully Pulpit ’ s analysis .
The birthday ads serve a key purpose for the Trump campaign : collecting contact information for possible new supporters as well as existing ones . Asking people to sign a birthday card is a tried-and-true tactic , digital experts said .
“ Digital list-building efforts like birthday cards are a great way to re-engage supporters , to refresh your email list and to grow a more personal relationship with your existing donor base , ” said Michael Duncan , a Republican digital strategist who is a founding partner at Cavalry , a public affairs firm .
The birthday ads are just one attempt to gather contact information . Other Trump ads ask people to take an “ Official Presidential Job Performance Survey ” or a “ Mainstream Media Accountability Survey ” — and to provide their name , email address and ZIP code in the process .
“ We try to harvest and bring people in to become direct contacts , ” Mr. Parscale said on Fox News in January . “ Cellphone numbers , email addresses , things that we can have direct contact . ”
Mr. Parscale said he hoped to accumulate contact information for as many as 40 , 50 or 60 million people by the 2020 election . “ We might possibly have everybody that could vote for the president in a direct contact method by Election Day , ” he said .
Some Trump ads on Facebook have invoked themes like immigration , socialism and the supposed “ witch hunt ” against Mr. Trump — all topics that the president has been fond of talking about and is likely to continue discussing as he seeks a second term . He has also run ads highlighting last year ’ s criminal justice overhaul , as well as Spanish-language ads about Venezuela .
“ You can really see the start of their general election campaign strategy and platform when you look through these ads over the past number of months , ” said Tara McGowan , a Democratic digital strategist who is the founder and chief executive of Acronym , a progressive digital organization that has also been tracking Facebook spending by the candidates .
The issue of immigration is at the core of Mr. Trump ’ s political identity , having been a central focus of his 2016 bid , and it has been a significant theme in his re-election campaign ’ s advertising as well .
Some ads ask people to vote on whether Mr. Trump should close the border . Others ask people to take an “ Official Secure The Border Survey , ” whose questions include , “ Do you think Democrats care about your safety ? ” Still more ask people to sign a petition to end what Mr. Trump calls “ chain migration , ” or family-based immigration .
Over a two-week stretch in late March and early April , roughly three-quarters of Mr. Trump ’ s spending on Facebook advertising was for immigration-related ads , according to the analysis from Bully Pulpit . The firm classified Mr. Trump ’ s ads based on keywords included in their text ; the immigration ads included words like “ wall ” or “ border . ”","President Trump’s re-election campaign has spent far more than any single Democratic presidential candidate on Facebook advertising, reprising a strategy that was central to his 2016 victory.

Over five weeks, Mr. Trump spent an estimated $450,000 on birthday ads on Facebook, accounting for slightly more than half of his Facebook spending during that time, according to Bully Pulpit’s analysis.

The birthday ads serve a key purpose for the Trump campaign: collecting contact information for possible new supporters as well as existing ones. Asking people to sign a birthday card is a tried-and-true tactic, digital experts said.

“Digital list-building efforts like birthday cards are a great way to re-engage supporters, to refresh your email list and to grow a more personal relationship with your existing donor base,” said Michael Duncan, a Republican digital strategist who is a founding partner at Cavalry, a public affairs firm.

The birthday ads are just one attempt to gather contact information. Other Trump ads ask people to take an “Official Presidential Job Performance Survey” or a “Mainstream Media Accountability Survey” — and to provide their name, email address and ZIP code in the process.

“We try to harvest and bring people in to become direct contacts,” Mr. Parscale said on Fox News in January. “Cellphone numbers, email addresses, things that we can have direct contact.”

Mr. Parscale said he hoped to accumulate contact information for as many as 40, 50 or 60 million people by the 2020 election. “We might possibly have everybody that could vote for the president in a direct contact method by Election Day,” he said.

Some Trump ads on Facebook have invoked themes like immigration, socialism and the supposed “witch hunt” against Mr. Trump — all topics that the president has been fond of talking about and is likely to continue discussing as he seeks a second term. He has also run ads highlighting last year’s criminal justice overhaul, as well as Spanish-language ads about Venezuela.

“You can really see the start of their general election campaign strategy and platform when you look through these ads over the past number of months,” said Tara McGowan, a Democratic digital strategist who is the founder and chief executive of Acronym, a progressive digital organization that has also been tracking Facebook spending by the candidates.

The issue of immigration is at the core of Mr. Trump’s political identity, having been a central focus of his 2016 bid, and it has been a significant theme in his re-election campaign’s advertising as well.

Some ads ask people to vote on whether Mr. Trump should close the border. Others ask people to take an “Official Secure The Border Survey,” whose questions include, “Do you think Democrats care about your safety?” Still more ask people to sign a petition to end what Mr. Trump calls “chain migration,” or family-based immigration.

Over a two-week stretch in late March and early April, roughly three-quarters of Mr. Trump’s spending on Facebook advertising was for immigration-related ads, according to the analysis from Bully Pulpit. The firm classified Mr. Trump’s ads based on keywords included in their text; the immigration ads included words like “wall” or “border.”",www.nytimes.com,left,fQ7SKHLZyybUt35Z

The wide-ranging legislation purports to reform campaign finance with a series of vague, sweeping measures that will act to chill speech when they don’t actively regulate or squelch it. H.R. 1 is called the For the People Act but would be more aptly titled the Be Careful What You Say, It Might Be Illegal Act.

Progressives can’t abide the notion that people in this country get together to spend money on advocacy outside the purview of the government — in other words, freely promote their favored causes as befits a free people living in a free country.

The idea is to have clear rules so groups can promote their views without fear of running afoul of federal regulations.

H.R. 1 blows this regime up. It seeks to regulate any speech at any time that “promotes or supports the candidate, or attacks or opposes an opponent of the candidate,” a fuzzy standard that could catch up all manner of nonelectoral messages (e.g., “Trump’s tariffs are a mistake,” or “Support Trump’s wall”).

H.R. 1 also widens the definition of coordination between a group and a candidate to encompass almost any communication. It’d still be permissible to discuss a candidate’s position on an issue, so long as there is no talk “regarding the candidate’s or committee’s campaign advertising, message, strategy, policy, polling, allocation of resources, fundraising, or other campaign activities.”

Even if a group doesn’t coordinate with a candidate under this loose standard, it could still be deemed to have coordinated if it were founded by someone who goes on to become a candidate; relies on the professional services of someone who also did work for a candidate; or is run by someone who had conversations about a campaign with the relative of a candidate.

That ’ s because U.S. senators and President Donald Trump have failed to strike an agreement to fill any of three vacancies on the six-member commission that needs a quorum of at least four warm bodies to conduct most any high-level business .
The agency therefore can ’ t pass new rules , pursue investigations , issue fines , even hold formal public meetings .
What does this mean for political candidates , the body politic and U.S. elections in general ?
A lot , it turns out — little of it good .
“ The situation encourages chaos , and it encourages corruption , ” said former Rep. Zach Wamp , R-Tenn. “ Dysfunction is not the American way , and this is a national disgrace . ”
Here ’ s what ’ s specifically being lost as the FEC zombie-walks into the teeth of Election 2020 :
PUBLIC NOT WELCOME : Since Sept. 1 , the FEC has canceled four of its public meetings.That ’ s on top of three public meetings the agency canceled earlier this year , including two in January because of the partial federal government shutdown . If the FEC can ’ t muster a quorum by mid-December , the commission will all but certainly axe another four scheduled public meetings meetings .
TRUMP GETS REPRIEVE : In June , the ███ reported that Trump ’ s re-election campaign has repeatedly refused to pay public safety bills sent by the municipal governments of cities that have hosted the president ’ s campaign rallies . While debate rages over whether the campaign is legally obligated to pay them , federal law appears quite clear that it should at least be reporting these bills as “ disputed debt ” on its periodic campaign finance disclosures .
On Oct. 28 , Rep. Bill Pascrell , D-N.J. , sent a letter to the FEC demanding the agency open an investigation into Trump ’ s campaign for failing to disclose disputed debts . So long as the FEC lacks a quorum of commissioners , agency staff can begin work on such an investigation but commissioners themselves can ’ t take votes and finish it . The FEC ’ s state of affairs is particularly upsetting because Trump is hurting cities and should be held to account , Pascrell said by phone .
“ It ’ s a cheap stunt . Horrendous , ” the congressman said . “ Trump could pay . His campaign has lots of money . These cities should not be taken for granted . Cities are grasping for every dollar for their budgets . ”
INVESTIGATIONS JEOPARDIZED : As of May 1 , the FEC was grappling with a backlog of 289 cases on its enforcement docket . Of those , several dozen contained elements that already had surpassed a five-year statute of limitations or would by May 1 , 2020 , the FEC acknowledged in a letter earlier this year to the U.S. House ’ s Committee on House Administration .
The FEC didn ’ t immediately respond to a question about how large the backlog is today . But it almost certainly has grown since May . And numerous cases are fated , in part or in full , to surpass the statute of limitations — and therefore , expire , without justice being served .
In this regard , the FEC ’ s lack of a quorum “ is going to exacerbate an already existing problem , ” said former Republican FEC Chairman Lee Goodman , now a partner at the law firm Wiley Rein LLP .
Several of the cases on which the FEC hasn ’ t acted involve America First Action , a pro-Trump super PAC mired in the Ukraine scandal congressional Democrats are investigating as part of their Trump impeachment inquiry .
When the FEC eventually regains a quorum , its case workload will be massive , warned former Republican FEC Chairman Michael Toner .
“ It ’ s quite reasonable to assume that some of the more marginal cases will just be dismissed without action , ” Toner said .

NO BULLOCK BUCKS ? Democratic presidential candidate Steve Bullock , the governor of Montana and an outspoken campaign finance reformer , wants access to public presidential matching funds — an increasingly obsolete reserve nevertheless flush with cash ( more than $ 393 million as of June 30 ) and still available to White House hopefuls who agree to certain fundraising limits .
One problem : the FEC must vote on candidates ’ requests to access these matching funds . No commissioner quorum ? No vote . Bullock plans to soon file a formal presidential matching fund petition with the FEC , campaign spokeswoman Galia Slayen confirmed , but will “ keep options open ” if the agency can ’ t act . Such options could theoretically include filing a federal lawsuit or petitioning the U.S. Treasury directly .
Republican Sen. John McCain ’ s thirst for presidential matching funds during his 2008 presidential campaign was a key reason lawmakers and the White House ended the FEC ’ s only other extended loss of a quorum — one that lasted six months .
Former Republican FEC Commissioner David Mason , who along with Weintraub were the only two commissioners working during the FEC ’ s six-month quorum loss in 2008 , said he ’ s not surprised history is repeating itself .
“ Sooner or later , this was bound to happen … the underlying problem is a political problem and the degree of political division , ” Mason said .
BYPASS SURGERY : Political actors may considering giving up on the FEC as an arbiter of their election law-related complaints . Instead , they may seek relief in federal courts .

FORMAL ADVICE ON ICE : Political committees , companies , unions and even individuals may request that FEC commissioners provide them what ’ s called an “ advisory opinion. ” In essence , an advisory opinion is the FEC ’ s formal advice in response to a question about how to interpret federal campaign finance law .
But the FEC has so far informed three such requestors that they won ’ t be answering their questions any time soon .

Hunter , for her part , penned a Politico op-ed on Oct. 22 accusing Weintraub of numerous misdeeds , including “ using her official position to drag the FEC into political debates in which it does not belong , to promote herself and her personal views of what the law should be , and to mislead the public. ” The op-ed followed a formal request by Rep.

These are dark times at the Federal Election Commission, which has now gone two months without enough commissioners to enforce federal campaign finance laws.

That’s because U.S. senators and President Donald Trump have failed to strike an agreement to fill any of three vacancies on the six-member commission that needs a quorum of at least four warm bodies to conduct most any high-level business.

The agency therefore can’t pass new rules, pursue investigations, issue fines, even hold formal public meetings.

What does this mean for political candidates, the body politic and U.S. elections in general?

A lot, it turns out — little of it good.

“The situation encourages chaos, and it encourages corruption,” said former Rep. Zach Wamp, R-Tenn. “Dysfunction is not the American way, and this is a national disgrace.”

Here’s what’s specifically being lost as the FEC zombie-walks into the teeth of Election 2020:

If the FEC can’t muster a quorum by mid-December, the commission will all but certainly axe another four scheduled public meetings meetings.

TRUMP GETS REPRIEVE: In June, the Center for Public Integrity reported that Trump’s re-election campaign has repeatedly refused to pay public safety bills sent by the municipal governments of cities that have hosted the president’s campaign rallies.

Elizabeth Warren swooped into the Senate in 2012 as a progressive superstar, but now in office she’s taking a conservative approach to how she helps the next generation of Democratic hopefuls.

Warren hasn’t tapped into her deep fundraising network of liberal activists, female donors and women’s groups to help up-and-coming candidates raise the kind of big bucks they need to get through a tight race.

Instead, Warren is playing it safe by mostly fundraising for party committees and incumbents — the kind of contributions expected of almost any senator.

( QUIZ: Do you know Elizabeth Warren?)

Although Warren arrived in the Senate as one of its best-known members, she is careful about how she spends her time and exerts her influence — focusing mostly on issues important back home and those that mesh with her background as a Wall Street critic and consumer advocate.

And while candidates aren’t criticizing Warren for not unleashing her full fundraising power, they are making it clear they’d sure like her help.

“Sen. Warren is the best thing to happen to the Democratic Party in a long time,” said Kelly Westlund, a House Democratic candidate in Wisconsin backed by the Progressive Change Campaign Committee (PCCC). “She was the kind of candidate who made me pay attention to a race that I thought had nothing to do with me.”

Warren has done fundraising for several of her Senate colleagues, allowing the party committees to use her name for some email solicitations and making calls on behalf of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. She has also traveled to New York, Los Angeles, Boston, Pittsburgh and Martha’s Vineyard for DSCC fundraising events, according to sources familiar with her activities.

Candidates running to replace incumbents are hoping, however, that Warren will expand her role as the campaign season heats up and get more involved in their individual election battles.

Rick Weiland, who is running to replace retiring Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Johnson (D-S.D.), is also looking for some more political love from Warren.

“I think she’s got a tremendous national network, her engagement on the level nationally to help raise the profile and hopefully encourage resources could be extremely helpful to candidates — including me,” Weiland said. “I have not yet met with her.

“One indication that the memo’s dictates remain required protocol? Just six years ago, it was cited in a public memorandum written by the F.E.C.’s vice chairman at the time,” they concluded. “His name? Mr. Trump’s own former White House counsel — Don McGahn.”",www.rawstory.com,left,r820biNlqU63SwuH

In 2012 , those caps were roughly $ 46,000 for candidates and $ 70,000 for party committees .

The U.S. Supreme Court returns to the campaign finance fray on Tuesday, hearing arguments in a case that could undercut most of the remaining rules that limit big money in politics.

It's been three years since the court's landmark Citizens United ruling, which let loose a new flood of campaign cash into the political process. In that 2010 case, a narrow conservative court majority upset a century-long legal understanding and declared for the first time that corporations are people entitled to spend unlimited amounts on candidate elections. Those independent expenditure limitations were one pillar of the campaign finance law.

On Tuesday, the second pillar — contributions to candidates — is before the court. The justices will hear arguments on one aspect of contributions: the aggregate limits on contributions to candidates and political parties.

Campaign Contribution Limits

The case was brought by Shaun McCutcheon, a successful Alabama businessman whose real love is conservative politics. In the 2012 election season, McCutcheon gave roughly $33,000 to 16 Republican congressional candidates and a similar amount to Republican Party committees. He wanted to give more, but a federal law caps the aggregate amounts that individuals can give to candidates and political parties. In 2012, those caps were roughly $46,000 for candidates and $70,000 for party committees.

Of course, McCutcheon could spend any amount he wants to by giving to independent groups that have proliferated since Citizens United. These groups raise millions of dollars to spend on candidate elections, but they do so independently and are not supposed to coordinate with the candidate campaigns. McCutcheon, however, doesn't want to give to independent groups; he wants to give directly to candidates and the Republican Party.

As he said in an interview with NPR, ""It's just that sometimes it's more advantageous for the donor to donate directly to the campaign.""

Just What Do The Limits Prevent?

That advantage is at the heart of the issue before the Supreme Court on Tuesday. In 1974, in the wake of the Watergate scandal, Congress enacted the laws that still form the basic structure for campaign finance regulations. Part of that structure is the aggregate cap, which is intended to prevent circumventing limits on the amount that single donors can pour into campaigns.

The Supreme Court upheld an earlier version of the caps in 1976, and since then it has drawn a consistent line between expenditure limits on the one hand and contribution limits on the other. The distinction is based on the notion that large contributions to candidates pose the threat of ""the actuality"" and the ""appearance"" of corruption.

But McCutcheon says all he wants to do is give to more candidates and party groups. ""What the aggregate limits do is not limit how much you can give to a particular candidate, but limit how many candidates you can support in an effective way,"" says James Bopp, McCutcheon's lawyer.

Not so, say defenders of the aggregate limits. Without the aggregate caps, a single wealthy donor could give the current $5,200 maximum in a two-year cycle to all 468 of a party's House and Senate candidates, for a grand total of nearly $2.5 million. The same individual could also give about $1.2 million more per election cycle to the national and state party committees. And that doesn't even account for the $5,000 contributions to other political action committees.

Attorney Fred Wertheimer has helped write every campaign finance reform law since 1974. He observes that in the modern political world, members of Congress can and do set up joint fundraising committees that in turn funnel money to candidates.

Without the aggregate limits, ""the speaker of the House or the Democratic leader of the House could go to Mr. McCutcheon and ask him for a check for well over $2 million,"" says Wertheimer, ""and it is that relationship — that $2 million solicited by a powerful officeholder and given by a donor — that creates the corruption relationship that the court says Congress can prohibit.""

That's ""just a scare tactic,"" replies Bopp. ""They can't point to a single instance where this has ever happened. That tells you that this is just rank speculation.""

Speculation or not, the fact is that soliciting or giving such aggregate amounts has been illegal for almost 40 years. And if the aggregate caps are invalidated, the next challenge almost certainly would be to the current limits on individual contributions to candidates — $2,600 to each candidate per election.

In the 2012 election cycle, approximately 1,700 donors bumped up against the aggregate limit of about $123,000. Those individuals, and others, would likely be willing to give more.

'Enormous' Stakes

The issue has divided the parties, with Democrats generally supporting contribution limits, and Republicans against. Indeed, McCutcheon's Republican allies in this case, the Republican National Committee and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, are asking the Supreme Court to adopt a standard that very likely would invalidate all contribution limits right now, not just aggregate caps.

They maintain that contribution limits distort the political process by, in essence, forcing donors to give large amounts of money to outside political groups, instead of directly to the candidates these donors would prefer to support if there were no limits.

What is needed in the modern political system, argues lawyer Bopp, is more money, not less. The public doesn't ""even know who their congressman is or their senator is or ... who the vice president is. That means not enough money is being spent on politics"" to inform the public, he contends.

That's a proposition that is hotly disputed.

Wertheimer notes that in the 2012 election, the parties and candidates raised $5.2 billion, almost all of it under the existing limits. Increasingly, congressional and presidential races are funded by the top 1 percent of the wealthiest Americans, according to the nonpartisan Sunlight Foundation. The system, Wertheimer says caustically, is ""hardly starving"" for money, but it is at a critical juncture in another sense.

""The stakes in this case are enormous,"" he says. ""If this court were to strike down the aggregate limits ... it would create a new system of legalized bribery, which we haven't seen for decades.""

Since entering the presidential race just a few weeks ago, Michael Bloomberg has spent $100 million on campaign ads. That’s more than the top-polling Democrats have spent all year combined.

So far, that has resulted in only a modest bump in the polls. The latest Morning Consult poll shows Mr. Bloomberg at 6% nationally, behind the top four Democratic candidates, albeit ahead of the rest of the field.

The former New York mayor, whose net worth is estimated to be roughly $55 billion, is also building ground operations in the states, offering prospective field organizers salaries well above the going rate, according to The Washington Post.

Mr. Bloomberg is trying something that typically hasn’t worked in the modern campaign era. He is bypassing the early nominating states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada, and banking instead on a strong showing in the delegate-rich states that vote on Super Tuesday and beyond.

Previous candidates who’ve tried to skip or downplay the early contests – such as another former New York mayor, Rudy Giuliani – quickly found themselves marginalized and unable to generate momentum.

But none of those candidates had Mr. Bloomberg’s resources.

Some analysts are speculating that the fragmented nature of today’s Democratic electorate could give Mr. Bloomberg an opening. The same four candidates – Vice President Joe Biden, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg – have been at the top of the polls all year, though they have traded places at various times. Each is strong with different factions of voters – whether it’s seniors, young people, college-educated white voters, African Americans or Hispanics. No one has been able to grow their support beyond 20-25%.

Political outfits associated with 10 top presidential prospects in each party raised at least $ 86 million last year for committees that could help launch or support campaigns the minute they announce , according to a ███ analysis of recently filed campaign reports and interviews with the prospects ’ allies .
Wisconsin Gov . Scott Walker is headed to Dallas this week for a reelection fundraiser with rich Texas Republicans at the mansion of billionaire real estate titan Harlan Crow . Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas invited Foster Friess to be his guest at last week ’ s State of the Union . Rick Santorum met last month in the Northern Virginia offices of his political guru John Brabender with top advisers , several of whom are on the payroll of his political outfit Patriot Voices . And Louisiana Gov . Bobby Jindal , who recently started a nonprofit that can accept unlimited donations , last week met some of the right ’ s most prolific donors at a Koch brothers ’ retreat in the California desert .
Many of the biggest Democratic donors and top campaign operatives are aligning behind Hillary Clinton . But that hasn ’ t stopped prospective rivals from assembling their campaign-style operations and working the circuit , including Maryland Gov . Martin O ’ Malley , who recently hired a top New York fundraiser to solicit big checks from Wall Street .
The early money is flowing into state and federal reelection campaign committees , leadership PACs , super PACs and nonprofit groups created to boost pet causes . These outfits spent more than $ 50 million last year paying consultants and staff , funding political travel , donating to allies and buying ads .
This new pre-exploratory phase is critical to launching a presidential bid in the Citizens United age . Prospective candidates need a stable of rich allies to bolster their efforts well before the campaign starts — and fend off attacks from opponents who also have wealthy friends who can destroy a candidacy before it even launches with a single mega-donor check .
“ It takes an enormous amount of time and work , ” said Paul Begala , a top strategist to Priorities USA , a super PAC and sister nonprofit group that recently pledged its allegiance to Hillary Clinton . Begala said readying a presidential campaign in the Citizens United age reminded him of an old saying , “ The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago . The second best time is today . And this is 20 years ago . This is why we ’ re starting now . ”
The 2016 Democratic presidential nomination is widely considered Hillary Clinton ’ s for the taking . The infrastructure that ’ s arisen around her — without either her involvement or any surefire indication that she is even going to run — dwarfs anything any other Democrat could possibly muster and is unique in the annals of modern campaign finance .
Clinton ’ s inner circle has been keeping close tabs on a network of groups that together form a sort of Hillary shadow campaign that combined to raise more than $ 12 million in 2013 to build a voter database and a grass-roots army , and later to air ads for a presumptive 2016 run .
On the second to last day of 2013 , the billionaire currency trader George Soros — who had already given $ 25,000 to the Ready for Hillary super PAC that is spending big money building a voter file and grass-roots donor network for Clinton — stroked a $ 500,000 check to the American Bridge super PAC , which is defending Clinton against attacks from Republicans .
While Clinton has not been personally soliciting campaign dollars , all the members of Congress generating presidential buzz are actively raising smaller money into campaign committees and leadership PACs that , unlike super PACs , are beholden to federal contribution limits .
Sens . Cruz , Rand Paul of Kentucky and Marco Rubio of Florida , along with Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin are stretching the potential of such so-called hard-dollar fundraising through an innovative twist — joint committees that merge their various accounts and increase the maximum size of the donations they can accept to $ 10,000 a pop .
Rubio and Ryan , favorites of GOP establishment donors , raised $ 8 million and $ 4.8 million last year , respectively , through their various accounts . Both men spent heavily on digital operations , while Rubio spent $ 120,000 on ads defending the gun control stance of fellow GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire , whose opposition to expanded background checks had come under attack in ads funded by billionaire Michael Bloomberg . Ayotte , who is up for reelection in 2016 , could be a key presidential endorser in her state ’ s first-in-the-nation primary .
Cruz , a favorite of the anti-establishment tea party , pulled in $ 4.1 million primarily from small donors , but he has worked of late to make inroads with deeper pockets who could subsidize a 2016 presidential run . He took as his guest to last week ’ s State of the Union the Wyoming investor Friess , whose $ 2 million in super PAC spending helped lift Santorum to a surprisingly strong showing in the 2012 GOP primary .
Asked by Fox Business Channel ’ s Neil Cavuto whether he was “ jumping ship from Rick Santorum to Ted Cruz , ” Friess laughed . “ I am just so impressed with Ted Cruz , ” he said , “ but I am a Rick Santorum guy through and through . ”
In addition to his super PAC largesse , Friess spent time on the trail with Santorum ’ s 2012 campaign , though it struggled to raise hard money , and still owes $ 512,000 to various vendors , including $ 383,000 to Brabender and $ 10,000 to a NASCAR team he paid to sponsor . In the run-up to 2016 , Santorum is building a more robust operation through Patriot Voices , which last year raised $ 2.7 million into a federal PAC and a 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) nonprofit — cash that went toward a political staff , travel and boosting candidates in key early states .
Yet it ’ s the sugar-daddy courtship that has been especially competitive on the GOP side of the ledger . Call it the Friess effect , wherein big checks are seen as a more efficient way to jump-start a campaign .

Begala said readying a presidential campaign in the Citizens United age reminded him of an old saying, “The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is today. And this is 20 years ago. This is why we’re starting now.”

The 2016 Democratic presidential nomination is widely considered Hillary Clinton’s for the taking. The infrastructure that’s arisen around her — without either her involvement or any surefire indication that she is even going to run — dwarfs anything any other Democrat could possibly muster and is unique in the annals of modern campaign finance.

Clinton’s inner circle has been keeping close tabs on a network of groups that together form a sort of Hillary shadow campaign that combined to raise more than $12 million in 2013 to build a voter database and a grass-roots army, and later to air ads for a presumptive 2016 run.

On the second to last day of 2013, the billionaire currency trader George Soros — who had already given $25,000 to the Ready for Hillary super PAC that is spending big money building a voter file and grass-roots donor network for Clinton — stroked a $500,000 check to the American Bridge super PAC, which is defending Clinton against attacks from Republicans.

While Clinton has not been personally soliciting campaign dollars, all the members of Congress generating presidential buzz are actively raising smaller money into campaign committees and leadership PACs that, unlike super PACs, are beholden to federal contribution limits.

Sens. Cruz, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Marco Rubio of Florida, along with Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin are stretching the potential of such so-called hard-dollar fundraising through an innovative twist — joint committees that merge their various accounts and increase the maximum size of the donations they can accept to $10,000 a pop.

Rubio and Ryan, favorites of GOP establishment donors, raised $8 million and $4.8 million last year, respectively, through their various accounts. Both men spent heavily on digital operations, while Rubio spent $120,000 on ads defending the gun control stance of fellow GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, whose opposition to expanded background checks had come under attack in ads funded by billionaire Michael Bloomberg. Ayotte, who is up for reelection in 2016, could be a key presidential endorser in her state’s first-in-the-nation primary.

Cruz, a favorite of the anti-establishment tea party, pulled in $4.1 million primarily from small donors, but he has worked of late to make inroads with deeper pockets who could subsidize a 2016 presidential run. He took as his guest to last week’s State of the Union the Wyoming investor Friess, whose $2 million in super PAC spending helped lift Santorum to a surprisingly strong showing in the 2012 GOP primary.

Asked by Fox Business Channel’s Neil Cavuto whether he was “jumping ship from Rick Santorum to Ted Cruz,” Friess laughed. “I am just so impressed with Ted Cruz,” he said, “but I am a Rick Santorum guy through and through.”

In addition to his super PAC largesse, Friess spent time on the trail with Santorum’s 2012 campaign, though it struggled to raise hard money, and still owes $512,000 to various vendors, including $383,000 to Brabender and $10,000 to a NASCAR team he paid to sponsor. In the run-up to 2016, Santorum is building a more robust operation through Patriot Voices, which last year raised $2.7 million into a federal PAC and a 501(c)(4) nonprofit — cash that went toward a political staff, travel and boosting candidates in key early states.

Yet it’s the sugar-daddy courtship that has been especially competitive on the GOP side of the ledger. Call it the Friess effect, wherein big checks are seen as a more efficient way to jump-start a campaign.

Supporters of Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who raised $5.6 million into a super PAC supporting his 2012 campaign for the GOP nomination, recently transferred $200,000 in leftover cash into a nonprofit expected to set the stage for another presidential campaign.",www.politico.com,left,WtXdF7S88x5SzMIB

One of Chief Justice Roberts ’ former colleagues , retired Justice John Paul Stevens , testified to the Senate on Wednesday that the court has it wrong . He said that when elections are at stake , Congress should be allowed to impose a level playing field for all candidates .

The amendment would give Congress explicit powers to put a total limit on how much campaigns could raise or spend , and how much outsiders could spend to support or oppose federal candidates . It also would allow states to impose their own restrictions .
Mr. Udall ’ s amendment specifically says it wouldn ’ t infringe on freedom of the press .
But Mr. Cruz said that raised all sorts of thorny questions .
“ Why does a corporation like The New York Times or CBS or any other media corporation … enjoy greater First Amendment rights than individual citizens ? ” Mr. Cruz said .
Amending the Constitution is difficult . It would take approval by two-thirds of each house of Congress — something that is unlikely in either chamber right now — and then would have to be ratified by three-fourths of the states .
In the wake of the Citizens United decision , Democrats tried but failed to get legislation allowing more disclosure through Congress . Those changes would have required only a majority vote , so the chances are dim for more powerful changes envisioned in the constitutional amendment .
The last amendment that was ratified was more than 40 years ago , when the 26th Amendment granted those 18 and older the right to vote .

The amendment would give Congress explicit powers to put a total limit on how much campaigns could raise or spend, and how much outsiders could spend to support or oppose federal candidates. It also would allow states to impose their own restrictions.

Mr. Udall’s amendment specifically says it wouldn’t infringe on freedom of the press.

But Mr. Cruz said that raised all sorts of thorny questions.

“Why does a corporation like The New York Times or CBS or any other media corporation … enjoy greater First Amendment rights than individual citizens?” Mr. Cruz said.

Amending the Constitution is difficult. It would take approval by two-thirds of each house of Congress — something that is unlikely in either chamber right now — and then would have to be ratified by three-fourths of the states.

In the wake of the Citizens United decision, Democrats tried but failed to get legislation allowing more disclosure through Congress. Those changes would have required only a majority vote, so the chances are dim for more powerful changes envisioned in the constitutional amendment.

The last amendment that was ratified was more than 40 years ago, when the 26th Amendment granted those 18 and older the right to vote.

A 27th Amendment, restricting Congress‘ ability to change its own salary, was ratified in 1992, but it was proposed as part of the original package in 1789 that became the Bill of Rights.

Jeb Bush is getting all the millionaires, and Bernie Sanders is getting the small donors — those have been two prominent storylines in the 2016 money race for the presidency.

But what about everyone in between? The Washington, D.C.-based Campaign Finance Institute released data on campaign fundraising, and it paints a fascinating picture — which we decided to make into a literal picture. Here's how the different candidates' donation patterns stack up to each other:

What we found is that in the era of looser rules, candidates seem to have adopted a variety of fundraising models (for more analysis, read how we broke these models down). Some, like Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, are more dependent on their superPACs — as indicated by their share of support from super-big donations — while others, like Martin O'Malley, Ben Carson and Bernie Sanders, are dependent on their campaigns, which limit contributions to $2,700.

Many candidates' superPACs are taking on traditional campaign roles this cycle, like rapid response, in addition to making big ad buys.

However, some are taking advantage of other fundraising avenues, but those have a variety of different restrictions. A handful have 527s — tax-exempt groups that can raise unlimited money but can't specifically advocate for a candidate.

Despite only publicly committing $ 5 million to what is likely to be the de facto Trump super PAC , Sheldon and Miriam Adelson are pledging at least $ 25 million to pro-Trump presidential efforts , according to multiple people briefed on their donations . That sum includes giving to nonprofit group that will never be required to disclose his donations .
`` I 'm doing more than a lot of people think I 'm doing , '' Adelson recently told one top Trump ally . The casino magnate reportedly pledged to spend $ 100 million at the onset of the general election -- a total some expect him to still hit , though several sources cautioned that the famously hard-to-read casino magnate can always change his mind should Trump slump .
The Ricketts family , the founder and heirs to the TD Ameritrade fortune , have told associates that the Adelsons has pledged $ 25 million to their groups , which includes a revived super PAC , Future 45 , and the nonprofit 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) group , 45Committee . It is unclear how the Adelsons plan to split their checks between the entities .
And two people who have spoken personally with Todd Ricketts this week said Ricketts said he now had $ 35 million in the bank thanks to the Adelson donation and was working toward raising $ 70 million , earmarked exclusively for the presidential race .
Adelson and Ricketts representatives did not respond to request for comments , though an Adelson spokesman did deny a report in The Guardian , which first reported the $ 25 million commitment but claimed it was all promised to the super PAC .
After inviting unprecedented scorn from the Republican donor base during the primary only to plead for their checks once winning it , Trump enters the homestretch in a competitive financial position versus Clinton . That is mostly driven by Trump 's surprisingly successful online fundraising program , which flooded him with money over the summer largely given directly to his campaign -- though he had to pay a pretty penny to collect it .

And Trump himself is sparking hope from Republicans that he himself will put more skin in the game than the $ 2 million a month he has been investing in his bid since he wrapped up the primary . While Trump has yet to make a final commitment -- and fundraising emails as recently as this week suggested that he would only give his standard $ 2 million in September -- the $ 150 million last-hurrah advertising plan unveiled by Trump aides last week is almost certainly not possible without a substantial check from the man at the top .
And those who know the billionaire expect him to not tolerate a loss on account of his own stinginess -- and are predicting infusions from a competitive businessman who hates losing . Trump revealed Friday at a rally that he would spend `` over $ 100 million '' on the race .
`` If he wanted to run 10 more ads and there was n't money in the Republican National Committee or any other fund , '' said John Catsimatidis , a grocery magnate who himself spent over $ 10 million on his own political run for New York mayor , `` I would write a check . ''

But it held a major fundraiser on Thursday evening in New York City with Donald Trump Jr. and the group has obtained another $ 2 million check from Home Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus , according to a person close to the group , boosting his overall contributions to the group to $ 5 million .
The group , struggling since the departure of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and now threatened by the rise of Future 45 , is not required to disclose its fundraising totals until October 15 . But people close to the group predict -- and their abrupt stop in advertising this fall after a $ 13 million push substantiates -- that the super PAC has raised only between $ 15 and $ 20 million , far short of their initial goal .
Marcus is also expected to have donated to Make America Number One , a super PAC run by key Trump influencer and megadonor Rebekah Mercer .
It is the Adelson and Ricketts families , though , that are the hot commodities in GOP finance circles : Sheldon and Miriam Adelson scored four third-row seats to the first presidential debate this week in New York and were seen mingling with Trump friends ranging from Rudy Giuliani to Don King . And at a recent fundraiser in the Chicago suburbs this week , Trump praised Todd Ricketts on three separate occasions , according to an attendee , even as he ripped into other Illinois Republican elites like GOP Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk , who is trailing badly in his re-election race .
`` Guys like Kirk who are behind in the polls ca n't figure out why guys like me are ahead in the polls , '' Trump told the crowd , according to two attendees who relayed the remarks .
The Ricketts family is also focused on a half-dozen Senate races -- though their spending would not boost Kirk , who is not running in a presidential swing-state . And their focus remains tearing down Clinton , as they have done in a pair of searing new advertisements out this week .
The Ricketts family has committed $ 1 million to the effort , and is likely to find success in the American Opportunity Alliance , an exclusive , Wall Street-tied , socially liberal donor network that has largely spurned Trump , most prominently by hedge-funder Paul Singer , the most prolific bundler in GOP politics .
At least one of those prominent donors is not currently expected to get behind the group : Linda McMahon , the former US Senate candidate , who co-hosted the Rebuilding America Now event on Thursday .
In addition to Adelson and Marcus , Trump is also making inroads with their fellow leaders in the Republican Jewish Coalition , where Marc Goldman , a Florida investor and RJC board member , has taken the lead in trying to win over his pro-Israel peers .

Yet there are significant limitations on what a pro-Trump nonprofit could do . Given that Clinton is not a current federal officeholder , many campaign-finance lawyers have long believed that their options are particularly limited in the 2016 cycle . To maintain their tax-exempt status , nonprofits can not spend a majority of their money on elections , leading most of these political groups to run ads either `` thanking '' or scolding various public officials -- who just happen to be up for election -- that are ostensibly not related to the campaign .
Attacks on Clinton -- or , for that matter , praise for Trump , another person not in office -- could be severely limited by nonprofit law . Yet the Ricketts operation believes it has a way to tactically play 2016 politics even with their nonprofit , according to a person briefed on the plans .

Will Trump spend more?

After inviting unprecedented scorn from the Republican donor base during the primary only to plead for their checks once winning it, Trump enters the homestretch in a competitive financial position versus Clinton. That is mostly driven by Trump's surprisingly successful online fundraising program, which flooded him with money over the summer largely given directly to his campaign -- though he had to pay a pretty penny to collect it.

Eyes on Adelson, Ricketts families

It is the Adelson and Ricketts families, though, that are the hot commodities in GOP finance circles: Sheldon and Miriam Adelson scored four third-row seats to the first presidential debate this week in New York and were seen mingling with Trump friends ranging from Rudy Giuliani to Don King.

Arguably , the party hasn ’ t even reached a conclusion yet this cycle . But this doesn ’ t mean we can ’ t look for clues as to where party elites might be leaning . There are , of course , endorsements from party leaders , and as I ’ ve written about for ███ , the preferences of early-state activists to consider , but there ’ s another metric we haven ’ t looked at yet — donors who contribute to both candidates and party committees .
These donors are different than , say , the army of small donors who have fueled Sen. Bernie Sanders ’ s campaign , as they have demonstrated a vested interest in both a candidate and the Democratic Party as a whole . Such donors tend to have both the party ’ s and the candidate ’ s interests at heart , and , at least in the past , other party resources tend to lean the same direction they do . As political scientist Hans Hassell argues in his book “ The Party ’ s Primary , ” these donors ’ donation patterns can give us a pretty good idea of which candidate a party is leaning toward . Their support can often signal to other donors , endorsers and party actors that a candidate is to be taken seriously . ( I wrote a bit about this previously at the political science blog , Mischiefs of Faction . )
So using the campaign finance data collected by the National Institute on Money in Politics for the 2020 presidential cycle , I compiled all the donations of $ 200 or more made to Democratic presidential candidates across the first three quarters of 2019 , in addition to all the donations made to state or national Democratic Party committees during that same time period . I then grouped donations made to the candidates based on the following criteria :
First , to establish a baseline , I looked at the share of all donors who gave to a candidate in 2019 . ( Because some donors gave to multiple candidates , candidates ’ donor shares might add up to more than 100 . ) Then , I filtered that group to look at just those donors who gave to both a party committee and to a candidate — “ candidate-and-committee ” donors . Finally , I filtered that group of candidate-and-committee donors down to just the high-dollar contributors — individuals who gave at least $ 1,000 to a presidential candidate and also contributed to a party committee ( although not necessarily $ 1,000 ) .
If you add up the total number of unique donors — those who gave $ 200 or more to just one candidate — from each of the first three quarters of 2019 , there are just over 131,000 donors in total . ( Remember , though , that this isn ’ t the cycle ’ s entire universe of donors . There are thousands more donors who have given $ 1 , $ 5 , etc. , but the Federal Election Commission doesn ’ t capture their donations in the same level of detail . ) Only 3.5 percent of these donors have also donated to a party committee , and just 1.7 percent have given at least $ 1,000 to a presidential candidate . So even though these candidate-and-committee donors can help us understand where party elites may be leaning , we ’ re still talking about a pretty small slice of the overall share of Democratic donors this cycle
As you can see in the chart below , no single candidate has received an overwhelming share of donations from candidate and committee donors , high-dollar or otherwise . This should give us pause , as it ’ s more evidence that there isn ’ t a clear consensus yet , but there are some takeaways nonetheless . For one , although Sanders has a substantial share of overall donors ( roughly 13 percent of the total ) , he has the backing of only around 5 percent of the candidate-and-committee donors , which could signal his lack of support from traditional party supporters . This isn ’ t necessarily damning for Sanders — the whole rationale for his campaign is about bringing new voices into the political system — but he is nonetheless not doing as well among those who traditionally exert influence in the Democratic Party ’ s nomination process .
Instead , candidates like Pete Buttigieg , former mayor of South Bend , Indiana , and former Vice President Joe Biden have done well among these donors . ( As did Sen. Kamala Harris , although enthusiasm for her dried up in the second and third quarters , which could help explain why she dropped out in early December — her campaign was low on cash . ) Biden , meanwhile , has done very well among party-aligned donors after his entry into the race a month into the second quarter : Indeed , he dominated the field among high-dollar party donors ( those who gave at least $ 1,000 ) in the third quarter .
But perhaps the most striking story is Sen. Elizabeth Warren ’ s rise among these candidate-and-committee donors . She began in the number two position among these donors in the first quarter ( Harris led ) but shot up to number one by the third quarter , with nearly 40 percent of her donations from candidate-and-committee donors . Whether this will be true in the fourth quarter , at a time when her polling position has declined , remains to be seen , however . It ’ s also important to remember that Biden has maintained a decent edge over Warren in terms of the candidate-and-committee donors who have given at least $ 1,000 to a candidate , so these donors are also a significant area of strength for him .
So while this is yet another data point in favor of the idea that party elites have not really decided — they remain somewhat split between Biden , Buttigieg and Warren — Biden does have the healthiest advantage among donors who have given at least $ 1,000 . This could indicate that the party is coalescing around him ( even if his position as front-runner isn ’ t as strong or unanimous as that of some previous nominees ) — but whether majorities of caucusgoers and voters will agree remains to be seen .","Knowing who the Democratic Party wants as the nominee can be difficult, especially with a field this large.

It’s also important to remember that Biden has maintained a decent edge over Warren in terms of the candidate-and-committee donors who have given at least $1,000 to a candidate, so these donors are also a significant area of strength for him.

So while this is yet another data point in favor of the idea that party elites have not really decided — they remain somewhat split between Biden, Buttigieg and Warren — Biden does have the healthiest advantage among donors who have given at least $1,000. This could indicate that the party is coalescing around him (even if his position as front-runner isn’t as strong or unanimous as that of some previous nominees) — but whether majorities of caucusgoers and voters will agree remains to be seen.",www.fivethirtyeight.com,center,1ZUBh3AHEUIRMv8E

DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Democrat Cory Booker dropped out of the presidential race Monday, ending a campaign whose message of unity and love failed to resonate in a political era marked by chaos and anxiety.

Full Coverage: Election 2020

His departure now leaves a field that was once the most diverse in history with just one remaining African American candidate, former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick.

Since launching his campaign last February, Booker, a U.S. senator from New Jersey, struggled to raise the type of money required to support a White House bid. He was at the back of the pack in most surveys and failed to meet the polling requirements needed to participate in Tuesday’s debate. Booker also missed last month’s debate and exits the race polling in low single digits in the early primary states and nationwide.

In an email to supporters, Booker said that he “got into this race to win” and that his failure to make the debates prevented him from raising raise the money required for victory.

“Our campaign has reached the point where we need more money to scale up and continue building a campaign that can win -- money we don’t have, and money that is harder to raise because I won’t be on the next debate stage and because the urgent business of impeachment will rightly be keeping me in Washington,” he said.

Booker had warned that the looming impeachment trial of President Donald Trump would deal a “big, big blow” to his campaign by pulling him away from Iowa in the final weeks before the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses. He hinted at the challenges facing his campaign last week in an interview on The Associated Press’ “Ground Game” podcast .

“If we can’t raise more money in this final stretch, we won’t be able to do the things that other campaigns with more money can do to show presence,” he said.

In his email to supporters, Booker pledged to do “everything in my power to elect the eventual Democratic nominee for president,” though his campaign says he has no immediate plans to endorse a candidate in the primary.

It’s a humbling finish for someone who was once lauded by Oprah Winfrey as the “rock star mayor” who helped lead the renewal of Newark, New Jersey. During his seven years in City Hall, Booker was known for his headline-grabbing feats of local do-goodery, including running into a burning building to save a woman, and his early fluency with social media, which brought him 1.4 million followers on Twitter when the platform was little used in politics. His rhetorical skills and Ivy League background often brought comparisons to President Barack Obama, and he’d been discussed as a potential presidential contender since his arrival in the Senate in 2013.

Now, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has mastered the art of the selfie on social media. Another former mayor, Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, is seen as the freshest face in the field. Former Vice President Joe Biden has built a strong base of support with black voters. And Booker’s message of hope and love seemed to fall flat during an era characterized perhaps most strongly by Democratic fury over the actions of the Trump administration.

An early focus on building out a strong and seasoned campaign operation in Iowa and South Carolina may have hampered his campaign in the long run, as the resources he spent early on staff there left him working with a tight budget in the later stages of the primary, when many of his opponents were going on air with television ads. That meant that even later in the campaign, after he had collected some of the top endorsements in Iowa and visited South Carolina almost more than any other candidate, a significant portion of the electorate in both states either said they were unfamiliar with his campaign or viewed him unfavorably.

But he rarely drew a contrast with his opponents on the trail, even when asked directly, and even some of Booker’s supporters worried his message on Trump wasn’t sharp enough to go up against a Republican president known for dragging his opponents into the mud.

Booker struggled to land on a message that would resonate with voters. He’s long been seen as a progressive Democrat in the Senate, pushing for criminal justice reform and marijuana legalization. And on the campaign trail, he proposed establishing a $1,000 savings account for every child born in the U.S. to help close the racial wealth gap.

He was among the first candidates to release a gun control plan , and at the time it was the most ambitious in the field, as it included a gun licensing program that would have been seen as political suicide just a decade before.

But he also sought to frame himself as an uplifting, unifying figure who emphasized his bipartisan work record. That didn’t land in a Democratic primary that has often rewarded candidates who promised voters they were tough-minded fighters who could take on Trump.

Booker’s seat is up for a vote this year, and he will run for reelection to the Senate. A handful of candidates has launched campaigns for the seat, but Booker is expected to have an easy path to reelection.

Booker’s exit from the presidential race further narrows the once two dozen-strong field, which now stands at 12 candidates.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) called on Democrats in the House to use their leverage and reject a bipartisan spending bill to keep the government open until a measure tucked inside rolling back a piece of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law is removed.

“Who does Congress work for?” Warren said in a speech on the Senate floor Wednesday afternoon. “Does it work for the millionaires, the billionaires, the giant companies with their armies of lobbyists and lawyers, or does it work for all the people?”

Warren’s call went further than House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who said Wednesday that she is “deeply troubled” by the banking measure. The Democratic discontent with the measure could make passing the bill more difficult, as House Speaker John Boehner is not expected to have enough votes on his own.

Warren, a popular figure on the left, told Democrats to withhold their support for the funding bill until the Wall Street provisions are removed. Warren, a fierce opponent of Wall Street, is a populist who has supported reforming banks for years.

“Now, the House of Representatives is about to show us the worst of government for the rich and powerful,” she continued. “The House is about to vote on a budget deal, a deal negotiated behind closed doors that slips in a provision that would let derivatives traders on Wall Street gamble with taxpayer money and get bailed out by the government when their risky bets threaten to blow up our financial system.”

She acknowledged that bipartisan House and Senate negotiators have worked “long and hard” on the spending bill, and that Senate leadership “deserve great credit for preventing the House from carrying out some of their more aggressive … fantasies about dismantling even more pieces of financial reform.”

Edsall,"WHAT is the relevance of the symbiotic relationship between the finance industry and the House Financial Services Committee and the current campaign finance case before the Supreme Court , McCutcheon v Federal Election Commission ?
First and foremost , the McCutcheon case revolves around the issue of “ corruption and the appearance of corruption . ”
Shaun McCutcheon , the chief executive officer of Coalmont Electrical Development , is contesting federal laws that restrict the total or “ aggregate ” amount an individual can donate to federal candidates and political parties , on the grounds that this restriction unconstitutionally limits his free speech rights . ( There are at present no aggregate limits on the total amount that PACS and political party committees can contribute to candidates for federal office ; McCutcheon does not engage this issue . )
Ronald Collins and David Skover , two law professors who contribute commentary to ScotusBlog , a Web site devoted to Supreme Court cases , summarize McCutcheon ’ s position : “ During the 2011-2012 federal election cycle , ” they write , “ McCutcheon contributed to sixteen federal candidates and sought to contribute to twelve others . But for existing law , Mr. McCutcheon would have given $ 25,000 to each of three political committees established by the Republican Party . The R.N.C . wished to receive additional contributions from individuals like McCutcheon . To do any of this , however , would have contravened existing aggregate contribution limits . ‘ I just want to donate to more candidates , ’ said McCutcheon , adding rhetorically : ‘ Why am I not free to spend money however I want ? ’ ”
McCutcheon is explicitly not challenging limits on individual campaign donations to federal candidates ( set at $ 2,600 ) , to political parties ( $ 32,400 ) , to state parties ( $ 10,000 ) or to PACs ( $ 5,000 ) . Instead , McCutcheon ’ s brief argues that it is unconstitutional to place a $ 123,200 ceiling on an individual ’ s total contribution every two years , including a maximum of $ 48,600 to candidates and $ 74,600 to all PACs and parties : “ Aggregate limits , ” it argues , “ operate to prevent an individual from associating with , expressing support for , and assisting ‘ too many ’ candidates , political party committees , or PACs in a single election . ”
McCutcheon specifically addresses the issue of corruption this way : “ By its very nature , a contribution to a candidate , political party committee , or PAC that is within the legal base limit — that is , a contribution below the threshold at which Congress determined that a cognizable risk of corruption arises — does not raise the specter of corruption . The fact that an individual might choose to make many such innocuous contributions does not render any of them any more troubling or likely to corrupt its recipient . ”
Donald B. Verrilli , Jr. , the solicitor general , who is arguing the government ’ s case in support of the restrictions , contended before the court that corruption and the appearance of corruption are , in fact , exactly what is at stake : “ Aggregate limits , ” he suggested , “ combat corruption both by blocking circumvention of individual contribution limits and , equally fundamentally , by serving as a bulwark against a campaign finance system dominated by massive individual contributions in which the dangers of quid pro quo corruption would be obvious and inherent and the corrosive appearance of corruption would be overwhelming . ”","WHAT is the relevance of the symbiotic relationship between the finance industry and the House Financial Services Committee and the current campaign finance case before the Supreme Court, McCutcheon v Federal Election Commission?

McCutcheon specifically addresses the issue of corruption this way: “By its very nature, a contribution to a candidate, political party committee, or PAC that is within the legal base limit — that is, a contribution below the threshold at which Congress determined that a cognizable risk of corruption arises — does not raise the specter of corruption. The fact that an individual might choose to make many such innocuous contributions does not render any of them any more troubling or likely to corrupt its recipient.”

Donald B. Verrilli, Jr., the solicitor general, who is arguing the government’s case in support of the restrictions, contended before the court that corruption and the appearance of corruption are, in fact, exactly what is at stake: “Aggregate limits,” he suggested, “combat corruption both by blocking circumvention of individual contribution limits and, equally fundamentally, by serving as a bulwark against a campaign finance system dominated by massive individual contributions in which the dangers of quid pro quo corruption would be obvious and inherent and the corrosive appearance of corruption would be overwhelming.”",www.nytimes.com,left,blzgGANObcFqKWg4

A group of major GOP donors , led by New York billionaire Paul Singer , is quietly expanding its political footprint ahead of the midterm elections in an increasingly assertive effort to shape the direction of the Republican Party .

The ideological and tactical contours of Singer’s plans remain somewhat unclear, as does the membership of the American Opportunity Alliance, which is registered as a for-profit corporation in Delaware. If nothing else, though, the group appears to represent a new center of gravity in the world of GOP money, anchored by a famously prolific Republican bundler with a distinct ideological agenda.

But a closer examination of the claims around Trump’s fundraising surge — which the campaign says yielded $18 million in the 24 hours after the debate through online donations and a big-donor phone bank — suggests the haul might not be quite as significant to Trump as he and his campaign have made it out to be.

Story Continued Below

Based on the information voluntarily released by the campaign, it’s unclear how much of the windfall will go to campaign versus the Republican National Committee, or how much of the total came in pledges as opposed to actual cash. Nor is it clear how much came from the small donors about whom Trump boasts.

Some of those answers won't be revealed until the middle of October, when the campaign and its joint fundraising committees with the RNC will be required to file financial reports with the Federal Election Commission. But other details — including the amount raised from small donors in the 24 hours after the debate — may never be independently verifiable, thanks to the nuances of campaign finance reporting requirements.

Those nuances were lost in Trump’s boasts about the fundraising haul during a Tuesday evening speech in Melbourne, Florida, nearly 24 hours after the debate.

“Today, we had something where I understand through largely small donors and some others, we had the biggest day we’ve ever had,” Trump told the crowd in a humid airplane hangar. “Because of the success last night of the debate, they raised almost $18 million today. Can you believe it? $18 million. That’s a lot. $18 million in one day, think of that. And that was largely because of last night.”

Trump carried the theme through Wednesday night, boasting to a raucous crowd at the Waukesha County Expo Center about the $54 million he’d put into his campaign, and adding “but we’re being helped by the small donors. And yesterday, because of the tremendous success of the debate, we raised almost $18 million in one day.”

If Trump’s post-debate fundraising haul is anywhere near $18 million, it would be a major boost for a campaign that has lagged behind that of Hillary Clinton in fundraising and advertising. (In fact, Trump's campaign has said it plans to spend the cash infusion on a planned $140 million ad buy.) And it would stand as the biggest single-day fundraising haul, by far, of Trump's campaign, though it’s not possible to track such tallies precisely.

But it’s become an increasing political tactic to embellish selective details about fundraising — especially small-donor fundraising — to enhance the appearance of grass-roots momentum at critical moments of a campaign. Clinton used the tactic during her unsuccessful 2008 presidential campaign and again after her party’s nominating convention in July. Her campaign boasted that in the 24 hours after she accepted the Democratic presidential nomination, it raised $8.7 million — which at the time stood among the biggest single-day fundraising tallies.

A Trump campaign source said that only $5 million of the $18 million haul came in online donations made directly to the campaign, which tend to be the types of donations most driven by organic grass-roots energy. Online donations also usually are smaller and can be more useful in the long term since the donors who give them can continue to contribute without hitting the cap on donations of $2,700 for the primary election and $2,700 for the general election.

The remaining $13 million came through phone call solicitations made as part of a campaign “call day” in which about 100 major donors and campaign insiders — including Trump’s children and his vice presidential running mate Mike Pence — made telephone solicitations from the campaign’s headquarters in Manhattan’s Trump Tower.

Those donations would most likely be larger, since they would come from donors who either had a track record of writing big checks or who knew the person making the call.

The campaign source said that the call day donations were about equally split between the campaign and a joint fundraising committee called Trump Victory that includes the Trump campaign, the RNC, and about a dozen state party committees.

Trump Victory can accept checks as large as $449,500, making it easier to bring in huge sums of cash quickly. But, no matter how large the check to Trump Victory, only $2,700 can go to the Trump campaign, with the rest going to the RNC and the state parties.

Steve Mnuchin, the Trump campaign’s finance chairman, would not say how much of Tuesday’s haul would end up in the campaign’s coffers, but he pointed out that having a well-funded RNC also helps the campaign.

“From our standpoint, we were raising money for the joint fundraising committee and the campaign, it’s all very important because it’s all going to support either the ground campaign or more media,” said Mnuchin.

He participated in the call day and issued a statement afterward declaring that “with this kind of energy and generous support behind us, we are going to have President Donald J. Trump in the White House.”

Mnuchin would not comment, however, on how much of the money raised during the call day was in the form of pledges versus actual cash donations.

But a leading Republican fundraiser said that, with call days, there’s often a “difference between pledged and collected” contributions, so finance professionals are “always skeptical when a call day is included in any explanation.”

Additionally, GOP finance professionals have raised concerns about the return on investment from Trump’s small-dollar fundraising operation, which is run largely through a San Antonio-based Web design firm with no previous political experience that has been paid $12.5 million by the Trump campaign.

The online fundraising effort has relied on heavy spending to rent email lists and place digital ads soliciting small donations, sometimes producing duplicative or poorly targeted results.

campaign_finance,Fox News,2,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/omar-hit-with-fec-complaint-for-allegedly-paying-lovers-travel-expenses-with-campaign-funds,"Omar hit with FEC complaint, accused of paying alleged paramour's travel expenses with campaign funds",,Gregg Re,"The conservative , Virginia-based National Legal and Policy Center filed a complaint against Rep. Ilhan Omar , D-Minn. , with the Federal Election Commission ( FEC ) on Wednesday , alleging that the lawmaker used campaign funds to illegally reimburse her purported paramour for personal travel expenses .
The complaint also charges that Omar failed to itemize travel reimbursements as required by the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 -- and that the travel expenses increased during the same month that Omar 's alleged affair with married Washington , D.C. political consultant Tim Mynett , 38 , heated up .
The complaint was filed one day after it emerged that Beth Mynett , 55 , submitted divorce papers in Washington , D.C. , Superior Court , claiming her husband suddenly informed her earlier this year that he was having an affair with Omar .
Omar has denied that she had an affair with Mynett , and her attorneys have dismissed the FEC complaint as a baseless `` political ploy . '' When asked on Tuesday by WCCO if she was separated from her own husband and if she was dating anyone , Omar replied : `` No , I am not . As I said yesterday , I have no interest in really allowing the conversation about my personal life to continue and so I have no desire to discuss it . ''
DC CONSULTANT 'S ALLEGED AFFAIR WITH ILHAN OMAR IS FRONT AND CENTER IN DIVORCE PAPERS
Omar ’ s campaign has paid Mynett ’ s E. Street Group , LLC around $ 230,000 for fundraising consulting , digital communications , Internet advertising and travel expenses since 2018 , federal election records indicate . Most of those payments occurred after Election Day last year .
Eight disbursements from Ilhan 's campaign to the E Street Group for `` travel expenses , '' totaling $ 21,546.94 , were not itemized . FEC rules , the NLPC said , require that such travel expenses list the individual benefitting from the arrangement , as well as the date and purpose of the payment .
NLPC said that Omar 's team instead only listed E Street as the payee , and contained no details on the trips .
`` Although Mynett 's formal relationship with Rep. Omar 's campaign began in July 2018 , with the payment of $ 7,000 directly to Mynett , the reimbursements for Mynett 's travel did not commence until April 2019 , the same month that Dr. Mynett alleges in her filing that her husband told her of the affair , and made a 'shocking declaration of love ' for Rep. Omar , '' the complaint stated .
`` It appears that ... Mynett 's travel as reported by Ilhan for Congress may have been unrelated , or only partially related , to Omar 's campaign , '' the complaint continued , noting that `` romantic companionship '' is not a legitimate reason to spend campaign funds on travel .
There were no indications that Mynett , or anyone acting on his behalf , later reimbursed Omar 's campaign , NLPC said .
Responding to the complaint , David Mitrani , counsel to Ilhan for Congress and the E Street Group , said in a statement that `` any accusation made that our clients acted to skirt the law in any way is absolutely false , and completely unfounded . ''
`` E Street Group provides multiple different services to Ilhan for Congress under an arms-length contract – fundraising , digital advertising and the like , '' Mitrani said . `` As a part of those services , the principals of E Street Group travel around the country fundraising for the Congresswoman . There is nothing untoward about this , nor anything illegal about it – and the complaint even misstates the law on travel reimbursements ( as it is not required for payments to vendors , only for payments specifically to individuals ) . ''
Legal experts said the payments were not necessarily illegal because of Omar 's apparent personal connections to Mynett , as long as they were for bona fide campaign expenditures .
In June , Minnesota campaign finance officials found that Omar repeatedly violated state rules when she used campaign funds to pay for personal out-of-state travel as well as help on her tax returns . Omar was ordered to reimburse her former campaign committee nearly $ 3,500 .

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Saikat Chakrabarti , her then-chief of staff , apparently violated campaign finance law by funneling nearly $ 1 million in contributions from political action committees Chakrabarti established to private companies that he also controlled .","The conservative, Virginia-based National Legal and Policy Center filed a complaint against Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) on Wednesday, alleging that the lawmaker used campaign funds to illegally reimburse her purported paramour for personal travel expenses.

The complaint also charges that Omar failed to itemize travel reimbursements as required by the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 -- and that the travel expenses increased during the same month that Omar's alleged affair with married Washington, D.C. political consultant Tim Mynett, 38, heated up.

The complaint was filed one day after it emerged that Beth Mynett, 55, submitted divorce papers in Washington, D.C., Superior Court, claiming her husband suddenly informed her earlier this year that he was having an affair with Omar.

Omar has denied that she had an affair with Mynett, and her attorneys have dismissed the FEC complaint as a baseless ""political ploy."" When asked on Tuesday by WCCO if she was separated from her own husband and if she was dating anyone, Omar replied: ""No, I am not. As I said yesterday, I have no interest in really allowing the conversation about my personal life to continue and so I have no desire to discuss it.""

DC CONSULTANT'S ALLEGED AFFAIR WITH ILHAN OMAR IS FRONT AND CENTER IN DIVORCE PAPERS

Omar’s campaign has paid Mynett’s E. Street Group, LLC around $230,000 for fundraising consulting, digital communications, Internet advertising and travel expenses since 2018, federal election records indicate. Most of those payments occurred after Election Day last year.

Eight disbursements from Ilhan's campaign to the E Street Group for ""travel expenses,"" totaling $21,546.94, were not itemized. FEC rules, the NLPC said, require that such travel expenses list the individual benefitting from the arrangement, as well as the date and purpose of the payment.

NLPC said that Omar's team instead only listed E Street as the payee, and contained no details on the trips.

""Although Mynett's formal relationship with Rep. Omar's campaign began in July 2018, with the payment of $7,000 directly to Mynett, the reimbursements for Mynett's travel did not commence until April 2019, the same month that Dr. Mynett alleges in her filing that her husband told her of the affair, and made a 'shocking declaration of love' for Rep. Omar,"" the complaint stated.

""It appears that ... Mynett's travel as reported by Ilhan for Congress may have been unrelated, or only partially related, to Omar's campaign,"" the complaint continued, noting that ""romantic companionship"" is not a legitimate reason to spend campaign funds on travel.

There were no indications that Mynett, or anyone acting on his behalf, later reimbursed Omar's campaign, NLPC said.

Responding to the complaint, David Mitrani, counsel to Ilhan for Congress and the E Street Group, said in a statement that ""any accusation made that our clients acted to skirt the law in any way is absolutely false, and completely unfounded.""

""E Street Group provides multiple different services to Ilhan for Congress under an arms-length contract – fundraising, digital advertising and the like,"" Mitrani said. ""As a part of those services, the principals of E Street Group travel around the country fundraising for the Congresswoman. There is nothing untoward about this, nor anything illegal about it – and the complaint even misstates the law on travel reimbursements (as it is not required for payments to vendors, only for payments specifically to individuals).""

Legal experts said the payments were not necessarily illegal because of Omar's apparent personal connections to Mynett, as long as they were for bona fide campaign expenditures.

In June, Minnesota campaign finance officials found that Omar repeatedly violated state rules when she used campaign funds to pay for personal out-of-state travel as well as help on her tax returns. Omar was ordered to reimburse her former campaign committee nearly $3,500.

The Minnesota Campaign Finance and Public Disclosure Board said the first-term congresswoman also must pay the state a $500 civil penalty for using campaign money to travel to Florida, where she accepted an honorarium.

There's a new stimulus plan underway in America: $5.8 billion is being injected into the U.S. economy, particularly in states like Ohio, Virginia, Colorado and Florida.

We're talking of course about campaign spending, and this year's elections will be the most expensive in history. In fact, by the time we all head to the voting booth on Election Day, nearly $6 billion will have been spent on campaigns — big and small — all across America.

Much of that money will come from superPACs and other outside groups free to spend as much as they want, mostly on Obama and Romney ads.

Money's Indirect Impact

So how much of an impact could all of that outside money have, at least on the presidential level? So far, it doesn't appear like it's having much at all.

Sheila Krumholz, with the Center for Responsive Politics, tells Raz that the money could have an impact in a different way, however.

""I think the money will be very targeted ... in the swing states and in specific places,"" Krumholz says. ""[But] we will not know when the money will drop, where [it will drop] and where it's coming from.""

This added dynamism, Krumholz says, makes the race more about the money than the merits of the candidate. In addition, she says the large corporate and trade union donors aren't interested in democracy but in a return in their investment.

""They have an agenda,"" she says. ""The problem is we may not know who stands to gain and what they will get in the end.""

Though it is hard to tell how much will be spent by many of these hidden donors, Krumholz estimates it could be more than $1 billion this election.

At a minimum, Krumholz says Congress should pass a narrowly tailored disclose act that ensures disclosures of the donors to superPACs.

Money Race Continues

The biggest pro-Romney superPAC, Restore our Future, is closing in on $100 million raised. By contrast, the pro-Obama superPAC, Priorities USA, has brought in about a third of that amount.

That could change in the coming weeks as Rahm Emanuel, Chicago mayor and former White House chief of staff, begins to help Priorities USA. Emanuel is one of the best Democratic fundraisers.

Still, according to Bill Burton, the group's founder, Democrats should be worried. He tells Raz that even though Mitt Romney might not seem like that impressive of a candidate to most Democrats, he is still a real threat to President Obama because of the money involved.

""Republicans of means are more motivated to engage in this race,"" Burton says. ""If you're someone who is at an oil company or on Wall Street, and you really want oil companies or Wall Street to be deregulated, then giving $10 [million] or $20 million is a very small investment.""

Though he works at a superPAC, Burton supports a proposed amendment to effectively overturn the Supreme Court decision that allowed for unlimited corporate and union money in politics and paved the way for superPACs. He says the campaign finance system is broken and needs to be fixed.
