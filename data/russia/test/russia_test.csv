Russian hackers trying to influence the 2018 elections made an unsuccessful attempt to breach the computer system of Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill , one of this fall 's most vulnerable Democrats .
The Daily Beast reported that McCaskill is the first known target of the Kremlin 's plot to interfere in this fall 's midterm elections after targeting the U.S. in the 2016 presidential election .
McCaskill has been a critic of Russia and of President Trump — who has at times doubted that any such interference happened at all and decried attempts by special counsel Robert Mueller to investigate as a `` witch hunt .

`` Russia continues to engage in cyber warfare against our democracy .

I will not be intimidated . I 've said it before and I will say it again , Putin is a thug and a bully . ''
The Daily Beast reported that the attack was similar to one used by Russia 's `` Fancy Bear '' hackers to access emails by John Podesta , the campaign chairman of 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton :
`` The hackers sent forged notification emails to Senate targets claiming the target 's Microsoft Exchange password had expired , and instructing them to change it . If the target clicked on the link , he or she was taken to a convincing replica of the U.S. Senate 's Active Directory Federation Services ( ADFS ) login page , a single sign-on point for e-mail and other services . `` As with the Podesta phishing , each Senate phishing email had a different link coded with the recipient 's email address .

McCaskill has been a critic of Russia and of President Trump — who has at times doubted that any such interference happened at all and decried attempts by special counsel Robert Mueller to investigate as a ""witch hunt."" At a press conference last week after his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump appeared to believe Putin's denials over the conclusions of U.S. intelligence agencies, though he later tried to walk that back.

In a statement, McCaskill said she ""will not be intimidated"" by the attempts, which occurred around August 2017.

It 's another sign of Trump 's efforts to build closer ties with Moscow , even though he insists his administration has taken a hard line toward Russia .
`` There 's never been a president as tough on Russia as I have been , '' Trump told reporters on Wednesday .
That might sound like hyperbole , but in this case , there 's actually some basis for the president 's boast .
`` When you actually look at the substance of what this administration has done , not the rhetoric but the substance , this administration has been much tougher on Russia than any in the post-Cold War era , '' said Daniel Vajdich , senior fellow at the Atlantic Council .
Take military spending : Trump sought to add $ 1.4 billion for fiscal year 2018 to the European Deterrence Initiative — a military effort to deter Russian aggression that was initially known as the European Reassurance Initiative . That 's a 41 percent increase from the last year of the Obama administration . The president also agreed to send lethal weapons to Ukraine — a step that Obama resisted . And Trump gave U.S. forces in Syria more leeway to engage with Russian troops .
`` Those loosened rules of engagement have resulted in direct military clashes with Russian militants and mercenaries on the ground , actually resulting in one incident in hundreds of casualties on the Russian side , '' Vajdich said .
The administration has also imposed sanctions on dozens of Russian oligarchs and government officials . And Trump has aggressively promoted U.S. energy exports , although so far that has n't created much competition for Russia 's oil and gas .
`` Russian gas sales to Europe last year were at record levels , '' said Ed Chow , who studies energy and national security at the Center for Strategic and International Studies . `` Russians will always have a cost advantage . And if they want to protect market share , all they have to do is lower the price . ''
Whatever tough policies the White House may have adopted toward Moscow also have to be weighed against Trump 's rhetoric , which is consistently friendly to Putin . He suggested inviting Russia to rejoin the G-7 , a group Moscow was suspended from following the illegal annexation of Crimea . Trump also congratulated Putin on his suspect re-election victory , despite explicit instructions from his advisers .
`` There 's a real disconnect between the president 's words and the underlying policy , '' said Richard Fontaine , president of the Center for a New American Security .
While Trump has no qualms about criticizing leaders of allied countries like Germany 's Angela Merkel , Canada 's Justin Trudeau or the U.K. 's Theresa May , he almost always treats Putin with kid gloves .
`` The president very rarely speaks about Putin 's transgressions and when asked about them expresses the hope that everyone can get along , '' said Fontaine , a former national security adviser to Sen. John McCain , R-Ariz .
Just last week , Trump told reporters in the U.K. , `` If we could develop a relationship which is good for Russia , good for us , good for everybody , that would be great . ''
He went on to remind May how he agreed to expel 60 Russians — diplomats and suspected intelligence agents — last year in retaliation for the suspected poisoning of an ex-spy in Britain .
The Washington Post reported Trump was irritated that the U.S. seemed to be taking stronger actions against Moscow than the Europeans were . The president was also reportedly reluctant to send those lethal weapons to Ukraine , arguing again that Europe should take the lead .
However grudging Trump 's moves against Moscow might have been , though , his defenders say the actions speak for themselves .
`` It is hard for me to believe that he was dragged kicking and screaming through each and every one of these decisions , '' Vajdich said .","Is Trump The Toughest Ever On Russia?

It's another sign of Trump's efforts to build closer ties with Moscow, even though he insists his administration has taken a hard line toward Russia.

""There's never been a president as tough on Russia as I have been,"" Trump told reporters on Wednesday.

That might sound like hyperbole, but in this case, there's actually some basis for the president's boast.

""When you actually look at the substance of what this administration has done, not the rhetoric but the substance, this administration has been much tougher on Russia than any in the post-Cold War era,"" said Daniel Vajdich, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.

Take military spending: Trump sought to add $1.4 billion for fiscal year 2018 to the European Deterrence Initiative — a military effort to deter Russian aggression that was initially known as the European Reassurance Initiative. That's a 41 percent increase from the last year of the Obama administration. The president also agreed to send lethal weapons to Ukraine — a step that Obama resisted. And Trump gave U.S. forces in Syria more leeway to engage with Russian troops.

""Those loosened rules of engagement have resulted in direct military clashes with Russian militants and mercenaries on the ground, actually resulting in one incident in hundreds of casualties on the Russian side,"" Vajdich said.

The administration has also imposed sanctions on dozens of Russian oligarchs and government officials. And Trump has aggressively promoted U.S. energy exports, although so far that hasn't created much competition for Russia's oil and gas.

""Russian gas sales to Europe last year were at record levels,"" said Ed Chow, who studies energy and national security at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""Russians will always have a cost advantage. And if they want to protect market share, all they have to do is lower the price.""

Whatever tough policies the White House may have adopted toward Moscow also have to be weighed against Trump's rhetoric, which is consistently friendly to Putin. He suggested inviting Russia to rejoin the G-7, a group Moscow was suspended from following the illegal annexation of Crimea. Trump also congratulated Putin on his suspect re-election victory, despite explicit instructions from his advisers.

""There's a real disconnect between the president's words and the underlying policy,"" said Richard Fontaine, president of the Center for a New American Security.

While Trump has no qualms about criticizing leaders of allied countries like Germany's Angela Merkel, Canada's Justin Trudeau or the U.K.'s Theresa May, he almost always treats Putin with kid gloves.

""The president very rarely speaks about Putin's transgressions and when asked about them expresses the hope that everyone can get along,"" said Fontaine, a former national security adviser to Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.

Just last week, Trump told reporters in the U.K., ""If we could develop a relationship which is good for Russia, good for us, good for everybody, that would be great.""

He went on to remind May how he agreed to expel 60 Russians — diplomats and suspected intelligence agents — last year in retaliation for the suspected poisoning of an ex-spy in Britain.

""And Germany did three,"" he added grimly.

The Washington Post reported Trump was irritated that the U.S. seemed to be taking stronger actions against Moscow than the Europeans were. The president was also reportedly reluctant to send those lethal weapons to Ukraine, arguing again that Europe should take the lead.

However grudging Trump's moves against Moscow might have been, though, his defenders say the actions speak for themselves.

""It is hard for me to believe that he was dragged kicking and screaming through each and every one of these decisions,"" Vajdich said.",www.npr.org,center,woyPaEvc0jv1Im4P

A spokesperson for Prince , the founder of the private security firm Blackwater who donated $ 250,000 to President Trump during the 2016 election through his campaign and two super PACs supporting him , confirmed the report in a statement , saying that Prince had “ cooperated completely with the Special Counsel ’ s investigation . ”
“ As Mr . Prince told the Daily Beast he has spoken voluntarily with Congress and also cooperated completely with the Special Counsel ’ s investigation , including by providing them total access to his phones and computer , ” the spokesperson stated . “ Mr . Prince has a lot of opinions about the various investigations , but there is no question that they are important and serious , and so Mr . Prince will keep his opinions to himself for now and to let the investigators do their work . ”
The spokesperson added that Prince was “ confident ” he would be able to “ put these distractions to the side ” once investigators finished their work .
Prince , who was allegedly attempting to establish a “ backchannel ” between the Trump White House and the Kremlin , according to U.S. and Arab officials , is under investigation by the special counsel ’ s office over that meeting , which took place on January 11 , 2017 , one week prior to Trump ’ s inauguration . He has been under investigation since March this year , and the Washington Post first reported the meeting in April 2017 .
The Blackwater founder has denied that the meeting , reportedly with Kirill Dmitriev , was planned ahead of time . Prince maintains that the meeting was a chance encounter over beers , and that they made no effort to establish a backchannel , as the Post reported . Dmitriev was appointed by Russian President Vladimir Putin to run the country ’ s $ 10 billion sovereign wealth fund in December 2013 .
Monday ’ s development complicates things for Trump : in addition to Prince , several other Trump associates have agreed to cooperate with Mueller on the Russia investigation in recent months .
In March , the man allegedly responsible for planning the Seychelles meeting , George Nader , also agreed to cooperate with the special counsel ’ s office in exchange for partial immunity . According to The New York Times , Nader has numerous ties to Russia , including those within Putin ’ s inner circle . As Vox notes , Nader met with former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon and current senior adviser Jared Kushner on several occasions after Trump ’ s inauguration .
Former Trump campaign officials , including Rick Gates , have also agreed to cooperate with Mueller in exchange for lighter sentences . Gates and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort were charged last October on multiple counts , including lying to the FBI , money laundering , and conspiracy against the United States . Gates pleaded guilty to two of the charges against him — conspiracy against the United States and lying to the FBI — in February , promising to cooperate with Mueller on the Russia investigation . Manafort has repeatedly tried to get the charges against himself dropped , to no avail .
George Papadopoulos , a former foreign policy adviser for Trump ’ s campaign , pleaded guilty last fall to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian officials .
More recently , Trump ’ s longtime attorney , Michael Cohen , appeared ready to begin cooperating with federal prosecutors in New York as well . This development would , according to ABC News , “ hit the White House , family members , staffers and counsels hard . ”
Cohen has long been viewed as Trump ’ s “ fixer ” and was named in the now-infamous Steele Dossier , which detailed allegations of misconduct and possible collusion with Russian officials by Trump and several campaign associates . According to the dossier and subsequent reports by McClatchy ’ s D.C. bureau , Cohen allegedly traveled to Prague ahead of the election to meet with Russian officials and bury any evidence of collusion , allegations which Cohen has vehemently and repeatedly denied .
Cohen was also involved in facilitating hush-money payments to two women — Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal — who said they had sexual relationships with Trump , and were paid to keep quiet about it in the days leading up to the 2016 election .

The new Democratic memo – examining how the FISA Court approved surveillance of former Trump campaign aide Carter Page – was part of an ongoing round-the-clock campaign to weaken President Trump , delegitimize his election , and make him look like a Russian puppet who needs to be impeached .
Democrats are basing their political strategy to win back congressional majorities in November on turning the American people against President Trump . To further this objective , they produced a memo that reads like talking points for one of the anti-Trump tirades that take up much of the day and night on CNN or MSNBC .
In fact , the Intelligence Committee ’ s ranking member , Rep. Adam Schiff , D-Calif. – who few people had ever heard of before last year – has parlayed the endless Democratic conspiracy theories against President Trump into TV stardom . He gave 21 hours of TV interviews in 2017 to push his narrative that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to defeat Hillary Clinton in 2016 .
The release of the Democratic memo was delayed because the Democrats deliberately included highly classified information that was difficult to declassify , so they could cry foul when the Trump administration refused to release this information . As a result , several sentences of the declassified memo were blacked out .
The new Democratic memo … was part of an ongoing round-the-clock campaign to weaken President Trump , delegitimize his election , and make him look like a Russian puppet who needs to be impeached .
Typical for a Schiff media interview , the Democratic rebuttal starts off with wild accusations against Republicans for “ a transparent effort to undermine ” the FBI , Justice Department , Special Counsel Robert Mueller ’ s Russia probe and congressional Russia investigations .
Among the major points of the rebuttal , the Democrats claim :
( 1 ) The Justice Department followed proper procedures and had compelling national security reasons for seeking a FISA warrant to conduct surveillance of Carter Page .
( 2 ) The FISA Court was properly informed about the partisan sponsorship of the Steele dossier , a series of memos compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele for the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee .
( 3 ) The Steele dossier did not drive the FBI investigation of Page or a FISA warrant application to spy on him .
The Democratic rebuttal tries to justify the Justice Department ’ s October 2016 FISA warrant application to spy on Page with sensationalistic claims that he was on the FBI ’ s radar for years due to his alleged contacts with Russian spies .
The rebuttal also makes claims about Page ’ s interactions with Russians in mid-2016 , when he reportedly was offered “ dirt ” on Hillary Clinton . It claims a supposed Russian-linked source told Page that Russia had thousands of Clinton ’ s emails that it could leak to hurt her campaign .
However , many of Page ’ s alleged 2016 interactions with Russians have not been corroborated . Some come from the Steele dossier which , despite claims in the rebuttal , is still uncorroborated . Parts of the dossier have been shown to be untrue .
The Democratic rebuttal also omits that Page had a brief , low-level role in the Trump campaign and was disparaged by a Russian intelligence officer in 2015 as “ an idiot . ”
Like Schiff ’ s frequent TV news interviews , the rebuttal misrepresents or omits many inconvenient facts . Two of these make the entire rebuttal impossible to take seriously .
First , the Republican memo said that Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe testified in a closed session in December 2017 that no warrant to spy on Page would have been sought from the FISA Court without the Steele dossier information . This is one of the most crucial points in the Republican memo , but the Democrats ignored it .
Instead , the Democratic rebuttal dances around McCabe ’ s statement by stating that other information drove the FBI investigation . The Democratic memo says the Justice Department “ provided additional information obtained through multiple corroborated sources that corroborated Steele ’ s reporting ” in the FISA warrant application .
This is a major omission . Either McCabe did or did not say the Steele dossier was the crucial information that drove the FISA warrant request .
The committee ’ s Republicans should declassify the transcript of McCabe ’ s remarks to expose what is very likely a huge Democratic misrepresentation .
Second , the Democratic rebuttal engages in verbal gymnastics to dispute Republican claims that the Justice Department failed to inform the FISA Court about the political sponsorship of the Steele dossier .
The rebuttal tries to do this by citing a vague sentence from a footnote in the October 2016 FISA warrant request that said : “ The FBI speculates that the identified U.S . Person was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit Candidate 1 ’ s [ Donald Trump ’ s ] campaign . ”
The “ identified U.S. person ” was Glenn Simpson , co-founder of Fusion GPS , a company that was paid by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee and in turn contracted with Steele to produce the dossier critical of Trump . This was not revealed to the FISA Court .
This gobbledygook on the FBI “ speculating ” that an unidentified U.S. person was seeking information to discredit the Trump campaign was designed to conceal from the FISA Court that the Steele memo was paid for by the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign . Incredibly , the Democratic rebuttal has no references whatsoever to the Democratic National Committee or the Clinton campaign .
In fact , the footnote cited by the Democrats strengthens the Republican claim that the October FISA warrant request omitted crucial information on the veracity of the Steele dossier .
The FISA judge obviously should have been told that a political party and a presidential campaign from one party funded a dossier to justify a FISA warrant to spy on a former member of a presidential campaign of the other political party . The Democrats ’ claim that the Justice Department “ accurately ” informed the court about this matter is laughable .
The highly misleading Democratic rebuttal is already having the intended effect by giving talking heads on TV news shows talking points to claim that the rebuttal disproved the Republican memo and provides evidence of collusion by the Trump campaign and Russia .
Expect Adam Schiff to be on TV as often as he can in coming days claiming his memo corrects the record . But the reality is that the Democratic rebuttal is full of the same unsubstantiated partisan claims that Schiff and other House Intelligence Committee Democrats have been making for over a year . It fails to rebut any of the serious allegations made by the committee ’ s Republicans .
The bottom line : don ’ t believe Adam Schiff when he hawks this fake rebuttal . He didn ’ t lay a glove on the Republican memo on serious abuses of the FISA process by the Justice Department , and the FBI to undermine the Trump presidential campaign .","

It should come as no surprise that partisan anti-Trump Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee issued a partisan anti-Trump memo Saturday attempting to rebut an earlier memo by committee Republicans dealing with abuses of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) Court.

The new Democratic memo … was part of an ongoing round-the-clock campaign to weaken President Trump, delegitimize his election, and make him look like a Russian puppet who needs to be impeached.

Typical for a Schiff media interview, the Democratic rebuttal starts off with wild accusations against Republicans for “a transparent effort to undermine” the FBI, Justice Department, Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe and congressional Russia investigations.

Among the major points of the rebuttal, the Democrats claim:

(1) The Justice Department followed proper procedures and had compelling national security reasons for seeking a FISA warrant to conduct surveillance of Carter Page.

(2) The FISA Court was properly informed about the partisan sponsorship of the Steele dossier, a series of memos compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele for the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee.

(3) The Steele dossier did not drive the FBI investigation of Page or a FISA warrant application to spy on him.

The Democratic rebuttal tries to justify the Justice Department’s October 2016 FISA warrant application to spy on Page with sensationalistic claims that he was on the FBI’s radar for years due to his alleged contacts with Russian spies.

The rebuttal also makes claims about Page’s interactions with Russians in mid-2016, when he reportedly was offered “dirt” on Hillary Clinton. It claims a supposed Russian-linked source told Page that Russia had thousands of Clinton’s emails that it could leak to hurt her campaign.

However, many of Page’s alleged 2016 interactions with Russians have not been corroborated. Some come from the Steele dossier which, despite claims in the rebuttal, is still uncorroborated. Parts of the dossier have been shown to be untrue.

The Democratic rebuttal also omits that Page had a brief, low-level role in the Trump campaign and was disparaged by a Russian intelligence officer in 2015 as “an idiot.”

Like Schiff’s frequent TV news interviews, the rebuttal misrepresents or omits many inconvenient facts. Two of these make the entire rebuttal impossible to take seriously.

First, the Republican memo said that Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe testified in a closed session in December 2017 that no warrant to spy on Page would have been sought from the FISA Court without the Steele dossier information. This is one of the most crucial points in the Republican memo, but the Democrats ignored it.

Instead, the Democratic rebuttal dances around McCabe’s statement by stating that other information drove the FBI investigation. The Democratic memo says the Justice Department “provided additional information obtained through multiple corroborated sources that corroborated Steele’s reporting” in the FISA warrant application.

This is a major omission. Either McCabe did or did not say the Steele dossier was the crucial information that drove the FISA warrant request.

The committee’s Republicans should declassify the transcript of McCabe’s remarks to expose what is very likely a huge Democratic misrepresentation.

Second, the Democratic rebuttal engages in verbal gymnastics to dispute Republican claims that the Justice Department failed to inform the FISA Court about the political sponsorship of the Steele dossier.

The rebuttal tries to do this by citing a vague sentence from a footnote in the October 2016 FISA warrant request that said: “The FBI speculates that the identified U.S. Person was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit Candidate 1’s [Donald Trump’s] campaign.”

The “identified U.S. person” was Glenn Simpson, co-founder of Fusion GPS, a company that was paid by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee and in turn contracted with Steele to produce the dossier critical of Trump. This was not revealed to the FISA Court.

This gobbledygook on the FBI “speculating” that an unidentified U.S. person was seeking information to discredit the Trump campaign was designed to conceal from the FISA Court that the Steele memo was paid for by the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign. Incredibly, the Democratic rebuttal has no references whatsoever to the Democratic National Committee or the Clinton campaign.

In fact, the footnote cited by the Democrats strengthens the Republican claim that the October FISA warrant request omitted crucial information on the veracity of the Steele dossier.

The FISA judge obviously should have been told that a political party and a presidential campaign from one party funded a dossier to justify a FISA warrant to spy on a former member of a presidential campaign of the other political party. The Democrats’ claim that the Justice Department “accurately” informed the court about this matter is laughable.

The highly misleading Democratic rebuttal is already having the intended effect by giving talking heads on TV news shows talking points to claim that the rebuttal disproved the Republican memo and provides evidence of collusion by the Trump campaign and Russia.

Expect Adam Schiff to be on TV as often as he can in coming days claiming his memo corrects the record. But the reality is that the Democratic rebuttal is full of the same unsubstantiated partisan claims that Schiff and other House Intelligence Committee Democrats have been making for over a year. It fails to rebut any of the serious allegations made by the committee’s Republicans.

The bottom line: don’t believe Adam Schiff when he hawks this fake rebuttal. He didn’t lay a glove on the Republican memo on serious abuses of the FISA process by the Justice Department, and the FBI to undermine the Trump presidential campaign.

The prospect of Putin visiting Washington is likely to sharpen divisions in the U.S. over relations with Russia amid continued tensions regarding alleged Kremlin meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections. Russia denies meddling. Trump won bipartisan praise in Congress for ordering the expulsion last week of 60 Russian diplomats regarded as spies, the most since 1986, in a display of unity with Europe after the U.K. blamed Putin’s government for the March 4 nerve-agent attack on former spy Sergei Skripal in England.

Trump had told reporters he discussed a potential summit with Putin shortly after the phone call but neither he nor Sanders disclosed that an invitation to the White House was under consideration until the Kremlin revealed it Monday.

‘Constructive Dialogue’

While Trump and Putin ordered summit preparations to begin after their phone call, the expulsions meant “there was no time for discussion and there wasn’t even anyone to discuss it with,” Ushakov said. The Kremlin hopes the U.S. has now stopped its actions against Russia so that “serious and constructive dialogue” can start, he said.

Trump triggered a political storm when he met at the White House with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov last May, a day after he fired then FBI Director James Comey, who was leading an investigation into the president’s connections to Russia.

The White House didn’t let U.S. reporters witness the meeting, which was also attended by Russia’s then U.S. ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, while Russian state news services released photographs of it. The talks were a prelude to Trump’s first meeting with Putin at the Group of 20 summit last July.

Trump congratulated Putin on his victory in last month’s presidential election during their phone call, without first reviewing written guidance from White House advisers. The Washington Post reported that talking points for the call included specific advice not to congratulate the Russian leader.

Trump made the comment at the White House Friday after hours of further escalating his rhetoric against longtime allies over U.S. trade practices .
`` Why are we having a meeting without Russia in the meeting ? Trump said . `` They should let Russia come back in because we should have Russia at the negotiating table . ''
Solidifying his solo status on the world stage , Trump also lashed out at longtime allies over their criticism of his trade policies and plans an early exit from the G-7 meeting .
Russia was ousted from the elite group in 2014 as punishment for President Vladimir Putin 's annexation of Crimea and its support for pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine . In the U.S. , special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating whether Trump 's campaign colluded with Russia in a bid to sway the 2016 presidential election in his favor .
Trump will arrive Friday at the annual gathering , held this year at a Quebec resort , but will leave Saturday morning before the event is over , heading to Singapore for his highly anticipated summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un . The White House announced his travel plans after French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau signaled they would use the G7 event to take a stance against new U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports .
`` Looking forward to straightening out unfair Trade Deals with the G-7 countries , '' Trump tweeted early Friday . `` If it does n't happen , we come out even better . ''
Trump also singled out tariffs on U.S. dairy products in yet another scathing tweet directed at Canada just before the G-7 .
At a joint press conference on Thursday , Macron said : `` A trade war does n't spare anyone . It will start first of all to hurt U.S . workers . '' Trudeau said : `` We are going to defend our industries and our workers . ''
Trudeau , for his part , said Trump 's action would hurt American workers as well as Canadians .
`` If I can get the president to actually realize that what he 's doing is counterproductive for his own goals as well , perhaps we can move forward in a smarter way , '' Trudeau said .
As tempers frayed , Trump had a ready retort , via tweet : `` Please tell Prime Minister Trudeau and President Macron that they are charging the U.S. massive tariffs and create non-monetary barriers . The EU trade surplus with the U.S. is $ 151 Billion , and Canada keeps our farmers and others out . Look forward to seeing them tomorrow . ''
Later Thursday , Trump tweeted : `` Prime Minister Trudeau is being so indignant , bringing up the relationship that the U.S. and Canada had over the many years and all sorts of other things ... but he does n't bring up the fact that they charge us up to 300 % on dairy — hurting our Farmers , killing our Agriculture ! ''
A few hours later , he added , `` Take down your tariffs & barriers or we will more than match you ! ''
With a cool reception all but assured , Trump has complained to aides about even having to attend the meeting , especially since his summit with Kim is just days away . Late Thursday , the White House announced that Trump would be leaving the G-7 late Saturday morning to head to Singapore ahead of his summit with Kim , though the G-7 meeting was scheduled to last until later that day .

Under Trump , the United States has abandoned its traditional role in the G-7 . His predecessors pressed for freer global trade and championed a trading system that required countries to follow World Trade Organization rules . Trump 's policies have been more protectionist and confrontational , driven by a perception that the U.S. has been the victim of poorly conceived trade deals .
Relations have hit such a low that a key question now is whether the seven countries can agree on a joint statement of priorities at the conclusion of the meeting . A gathering of G-7 finance ministers days earlier concluded last week with a message of `` concern and disappointment '' for Trump from the other six countries . France 's finance minister described the group as `` far more a G-6 plus one than a G-7 . ''
Macron made clear Thursday that the other six countries would n't hesitate to go it alone . On Twitter , he said : `` The American President may not mind being isolated , but neither do we mind signing a 6 country agreement if need be . ''
Trump 's top economic adviser , Larry Kudlow , was vague Wednesday on the outcome of the summit , saying : `` For these kind of decisions , let them meet first . Let them meet ; let them discuss . And then we 'll see what happens . ''
Tension has been building over a year of policymaking that has distanced the U.S. from traditional allies , including by Trump 's decisions to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear agreement . The new tariffs — 25 percent on imported steel , 10 percent on aluminum from Canada , Mexico and the European Union — threaten to drive up prices for American consumers and companies and heighten uncertainty for businesses and investors around the globe .

( Donna Carson/Reuters )
After Mueller , it is worth another look at its role in the report and its fallout .
This is Part Two of a two-part series . In Part One , we took a look at the OLC guidance that bars the indictment of a sitting president . ( The OLC is the Justice Department ’ s Office of Legal Counsel . ) In particular , we looked at ( a ) how , in investigating President Trump for purported obstruction , special counsel Robert Mueller ’ s staff distorted the guidance into a prohibition against even considering whether an offense occurred ; and ( b ) the futile hope of congressional Democrats , during Wednesday ’ s hearings , that Mueller would contradict his final report on this point .
In Part Two , we explore why Mueller ’ s staff of very able lawyers , many of them activist Democrats , twisted the OLC guidance . ( Spoiler : Their priority was to get their evidence to Congress , intact and as quickly as possible , in hopes of fueling an impeachment drive , or at least damaging Trump politically . ) We also analyze how attorney general Bill Barr deftly dealt with the Mueller staff ’ s gamesmanship .
As we observed at the end of Part One , Mueller ’ s report makes the whopper of the claim that prosecutors construed to OLC guidance to forbid them to make a charging decision on obstruction because they were trying to protect President Trump .
Well , Justice Department protocols prohibit prosecutors from prejudicing suspects by publicizing the evidence against them unless and until they are formally charged . The idea is that the government must refrain from speaking until it files an indictment . For at that point , the person becomes an “ accused ” under the Constitution , vested with all the due process guarantees our law provides : assistance of counsel , confrontation of witnesses , subpoena power — the full array of rights to challenge the government ’ s indictment .
From this commonsense proposition , Mueller ’ s staff leapt to an untenable conclusion : Because the OLC guidance prevents the Justice Department from formally charging a sitting president , poor President Trump would have been denied his due process protections if Mueller had recommended an indictment : It would be as if the government slimed him by publicizing the evidence but denied him his day in court to clear his name .
If this doesn ’ t insult the intelligence , nothing will . Sliming the uncharged president by publicizing the evidence is exactly what Mueller ’ s team did .
The special counsel ’ s staff wrote a 448-page tome , overflowing with details about a traitorous collusion plot that never happened and the obstruction of an investigation that was never actually impeded in the slightest . Even though the regulations call for a confidential report from the special counsel to the attorney general , the Mueller report was patently written with the intention that it would be transmitted to Congress and the public . ( Indeed , even before the report was submitted to the Justice Department , various industrious publishers planned to make it available for sale . ) Moreover , when AG Barr undertook to announce only the special counsel ’ s bottom-line conclusions , Mueller ’ s staff threw a fit , grousing to the media that Barr was wrongly withholding the report and denying the public the condemnatory narrative in which they had couched these benign conclusions .
Another of many reasons the Mueller staff ’ s claim to be protecting Trump is laughable : If Mueller and his staff were actually playing by the rules , they would have demanded that their report to Barr be kept confidential — like a normal consultation between a prosecutor and a supervisor about whether an indictment should be sought . If they had done that , there would have been no need for their touching expression of concern about the president ’ s rights . Any recommendation to indict or other prosecutorial deliberations would have remained non-public ; only the indictment , if one were ever filed , would become public . But Mueller ’ s staff wrote a report that was patently intended to be the antithesis of confidential . Due process is protected when the regulations are followed , not when they are flouted .
Finally , there are three other manifest problems with Mueller ’ s construction of the OLC guidance . First , if Mueller really believed the OLC guidance prevented him from even considering whether President Trump could be charged , why did he render a decision on the collusion aspect of the probe ? He can ’ t have it both ways . Second , if Mueller really believed the OLC guidance prevented him from performing the prosecutor ’ s task , why on earth did he accept the appointment to act as a prosecutor ? Third , if Mueller really believed the OLC guidance prevented him from considering whether to indict , why did he tell AG Barr , two weeks before filing his report , that the OLC guidance was not the reason he would refrain from recommending obstruction charges ?
Now , let ’ s bear in mind : Mueller ’ s staffers are very good lawyers . And many of them , including such laboring oars as Andrew Weissmann and Michael Dreeben , undoubtedly would like to see Trump driven from office — whether by prosecutors , lawmakers , or voters . So why would exceptional , aggressive prosecutors adopt a risible interpretation of the OLC guidance that tied their own hands , preventing them from finding an obstruction offense against the president when they had clearly tried very hard to make the case ?
Because they were smart enough to know they couldn ’ t make the criminal case in court , and that the best way to hurt Trump was to get their work to Congress , where it might fuel an impeachment push and would surely damage the president politically .
Why couldn ’ t they make the criminal case ? That brings us to an issue more central than the OLC guidance : the law of obstruction .
Mueller ’ s staff and the Justice Department , particularly under Barr , disagree fundamentally about what conduct may constitute an obstruction offense against a president . And there is a corollary : When there is a difference of opinion at the Justice Department , someone gets to decide . In this instance , that someone was Barr , not Mueller . That is , the special counsel could recommend an obstruction indictment , but it would be up to the attorney general to determine whether to follow the recommendation .
To summarize , Mueller ’ s staff operated under an expansive construction of obstruction , claiming that any presidential act — including legitimate exercises of a president ’ s constitutional prerogatives , such as firing or considering firing such subordinates as the FBI director and the special counsel himself — could be grounds for an obstruction charge if a prosecutor ( i.e. , an inferior executive official ) decided the chief executive ’ s motive was corrupt .
Barr , by contrast , hews to the traditional understanding that a president is only liable for a criminal obstruction charge if he engages in blatantly corrupt conduct that is not within his constitutional prerogatives — e.g. , bribing witnesses or destroying evidence . Importantly , that does not mean a president is immune from accountability for abusing executive powers ; rather , in our system , it is for Congress , not an inferior executive official , to second-guess the legitimacy of the chief executive ’ s acts — i.e. , Congress can impeach the president .
How did these divergent views of obstruction law play out in the Mueller investigation ?
For most of the probe , because of AG Jeff Sessions ’ s recusal , Mueller ’ s staff was “ supervised ” by deputy AG Rod Rosenstein ( the same guy who considered invoking the 25th Amendment against Trump , and who decided that the faded Mueller we watched testify this week would be a perfect fit to run the Russia investigation ) . Rosenstein ’ s passivity gave Mueller ’ s staff carte blanche to investigate obstruction under their ever-elastic theory . They intimidated administration officials , who feared that any objection to the legitimacy and tactics of Mueller ’ s probe would result in more allegations of corruption and obstruction .
Then in mid-February 2019 , after Mueller ’ s staff had been going merrily along this way for 21 months , Barr became attorney general . At that point , Mueller ’ s staffers knew they were now dealing with a strong AG who had a scholarly understanding of obstruction law and would not be cowed by their skill and aggression .
Barr was not going to buy the Mueller staff ’ s theory of obstruction . Consequently , if Mueller had recommended obstruction charges against Trump based on the legal analysis explicated in Volume II of the report , then the Justice Department would have rejected the recommendation and the legal analysis . There would have been an intense debate within the Justice Department involving the special counsel ’ s staff , OLC , and the AG — a debate Mueller ’ s staffers had to know they would lose if they were foolish enough to force it . Volume II would have gotten much more Justice Department scrutiny . Mueller ’ s staff would not only have been thwarted in their quest to indict Trump ; their report might have been tied up at DOJ for months — and perhaps never be released in its current form .
Mueller ’ s anti-Trump staffers knew they were never going to be able to drive Trump from office by indicting him . The only plausible way to drive him from office was to prioritize , over all else , making the report public . Then , perhaps Congress would use it to impeach . At the very least , the 448 pages of uncharged conduct would wound Trump politically , helping lead to his defeat in 2020 — an enticing thought for someone who had , say , attended the Hillary Clinton “ victory ” party and expressed adulatory “ awe ” for acting AG ( and fellow Obama holdover ) Sally Yates when she insubordinately refused to enforce Trump ’ s border security order .
Of course , it wouldn ’ t be enough to get the report to Congress . The challenge was to get it there with the obstruction case still viable even though prosecutors knew they couldn ’ t get away with recommending an obstruction indictment . How to accomplish this ? By pretending that the OLC guidance prevented prosecutors from even making a charging decision .
First , Barr would need to be informed that Mueller would not be rendering a decision on whether Trump should be charged with obstruction . Barr would no doubt be surprised and irked by this . Yet , the staff surmised that he would grudgingly accept it . For Barr , Mueller ’ s non-decision would not be nearly as hot a potato as a recommendation to indict Trump would be — he ’ d take the former to avoid the latter . They figured : What the administration most desired was to be able to say that Mueller had not found any obstruction ( or collusion ) offenses . Accepting Mueller ’ s abdication would allow for that . Plus , Barr would realize that if he ordered Mueller to make a decision , Mueller ’ s staff would probably recommend an indictment — the anti-Trump staff would never concede that Trump had not committed obstruction and , as Wednesday ’ s testimony made clear , Mueller was not up to a confrontation with his staff over the esoterica of obstruction law . If Mueller recommended an indictment of Trump , Barr would be unrelentingly vilified if he disagreed with Mueller ’ s obstruction analysis and overruled the recommendation .
Mueller ’ s staff also knew there would be great congressional and public demand to read their report , and that Barr had committed in his confirmation hearings to be as transparent as law and Justice Department policy allowed . If they conceded that they could not recommend obstruction charges , Mueller ’ s staff figured the report would be published rapidly , despite any disagreements Barr might have with its substance , including their expansive interpretation of obstruction law .
It was a very clever plan . There was just one potential hitch : the OLC guidance .
Mueller ’ s staff realized that Barr would want Mueller to explain his reasoning for not making a charging decision on obstruction . The staff would not want to say that the evidence of obstruction was not strong enough — that would hurt the position of congressional Democrats who want to impeach Trump . But neither would they be permitted to claim that the OLC guidance forbidding indictment of a sitting president prevented them from recommending obstruction charges . Barr would know that such a claim would be the functional equivalent of saying Trump should be charged . He would not countenance that ; he would instruct Mueller to make a recommendation , one way or the other , about whether Trump should be indicted , and leave it to Barr to worry about the OLC guidance .
That is , Mueller ’ s staff knew that if they claimed the OLC guidance was the sole reason they could not recommend an indictment , they ’ d be right back to square one : confronting all the downsides of making a recommendation to indict that would be rejected by Barr , that would provoke major Justice Department evaluation of their report , and that would likely keep the report under wraps interminably .
So , they would have to finesse the OLC guidance . ( That ’ s a polite way to put it , right ? )
Consequently , in their first meeting about the investigation , Mueller assured Barr that the OLC guidance was not his basis for refusing to decide the obstruction issue . When Barr inevitably pressed him on what , then , was his rationale , Mueller said his team was still formulating its reasoning . . . even though the decision not to decide had already been made .
Then , two weeks later , they filed the report . It was a masterful exercise in doublespeak . Mueller ’ s staff relied on the OLC guidance , but not for the purpose of refusing to make a recommendation ( which , again , would have been unacceptable to Barr ) . Instead , they claimed to interpret the guidance to prohibit them from even considering whether Trump should be charged . It is a head spinner : Mueller ’ s prosecutors acknowledged that they were not finding Trump had committed an obstruction crime ; but they carefully qualified that neither were they saying he had not committed obstruction — in their constitutionally offensive parlance , they were not “ exonerating ” the president . With a wink to congressional Democrats , Mueller ’ s activist Democratic staff essentially said : We ’ re not charging him , but that doesn ’ t mean there is insufficient evidence to charge . . . which means there might very well be impeachable offenses .
Barr , of course , is no slouch at the chess game . What would his responsive move be ?
He could have decided that Mueller ’ s position on the OLC guidance was untenable and that the special counsel must make a recommendation , yes or no , on obstruction . But Barr realized that if he cornered Mueller ’ s staffers this way , they would probably recommend an indictment . Again , that would draw Barr into a major controversy over whether to overrule Mueller , which the AG surely wanted to avoid . Barr thus opted to make a different move : He would accept Mueller ’ s report and exploit its weakness , namely , the special counsel ’ s failure to decide the central question of whether there was sufficient evidence to indict . With Mueller having abdicated , Barr would fill the void by making the decision — and he would do it in conjunction with Rosenstein , which would mean the official who supervised Mueller ’ s investigation for almost all of its duration was in agreement with the Barr ’ s determination .
Nor was that all . Even though he disagreed with Mueller ’ s interpretation of obstruction law , Barr adopted it for argument ’ s sake ; and similarly , he assumed the accuracy of Mueller ’ s investigation and undertook to decide the obstruction question solely on the facts as Mueller found them .
This was adroit . No matter what legal standard is employed , a prosecutor can not prove obstruction without establishing , beyond a reasonable doubt , that the defendant had corrupt intent . To say there is insufficient evidence of corrupt intent does not mean there is no evidence . At Wednesday ’ s hearing , Democrats seemed to believe that if there is evidence of corrupt intent ( or any other element of a criminal offense ) then that element is deemed to be satisfied . That , however , is not how it works . With an essential element of a criminal offense , there is almost always evidence on both sides . That evidence must be weighed , and the element is only deemed satisfied if it is proved beyond a reasonable doubt .
That is , Barr could accept all of the unsavory conduct Mueller uncovered , he could freely concede that some of this evidence implied an improper purpose , and yet he could still credibly find that intent could not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt . Why ? Because ( a ) Trump provided extraordinary cooperation to Mueller ( even making his White House counsel extensively available , which he did not have to do ) ; ( b ) Trump never shut down the investigation or fired Mueller , though he had the power to do so ; ( c ) the investigation was not actually impeded in any way ; ( d ) there was no underlying collusion crime so Trump could not have been trying to cover up a conspiracy with Russia ; and ( e ) Trump was lashing out due to frustration , not corruption , because he knew he was not a Russian agent but had to endure slanders that he was by investigators and political opponents .
In the end , then , Barr accepted Team Mueller ’ s gamesmanship on the OLC guidance , accepted their obstruction analysis , and accepted their conclusions of fact . By doing so , he left them no credible grounds to object , while he was nevertheless finding that Trump had not committed obstruction . He made the prosecutors ’ conclusions publicly available quickly — and they looked derelict because , in deciding to try to do Congress ’ s job , they had failed to do their own . All they could complain about was that the public did not get access to the anti-Trump flavor of their narrative quickly enough to suit them .
Mueller ’ s team was sharp . They creatively used the OLC guidance to try to signal an obstruction crime without quite accusing Trump of obstruction — banking on congressional Democrats to finish the job . In Barr , they just happened to run into a guy who figured out what they were doing , and who had the brains and the power to stay a step ahead .","Andrew Weissmann, a member of the Mueller-probe legal team, talks to reporters in downtown Houston in October 2002.

After Mueller, it is worth another look at its role in the report and its fallout.

This is Part Two of a two-part series. In Part One, we took a look at the OLC guidance that bars the indictment of a sitting president. (The OLC is the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel.) In particular, we looked at (a) how, in investigating President Trump for purported obstruction, special counsel Robert Mueller’s staff distorted the guidance into a prohibition against even considering whether an offense occurred; and (b) the futile hope of congressional Democrats, during Wednesday’s hearings, that Mueller would contradict his final report on this point.

In Part Two, we explore why Mueller’s staff of very able lawyers, many of them activist Democrats, twisted the OLC guidance. (Spoiler: Their priority was to get their evidence to Congress, intact and as quickly as possible, in hopes of fueling an impeachment drive, or at least damaging Trump politically.) We also analyze how attorney general Bill Barr deftly dealt with the Mueller staff’s gamesmanship.

As we observed at the end of Part One, Mueller’s report makes the whopper of the claim that prosecutors construed to OLC guidance to forbid them to make a charging decision on obstruction because they were trying to protect President Trump.

How’s that?

Well, Justice Department protocols prohibit prosecutors from prejudicing suspects by publicizing the evidence against them unless and until they are formally charged. The idea is that the government must refrain from speaking until it files an indictment. For at that point, the person becomes an “accused” under the Constitution, vested with all the due process guarantees our law provides: assistance of counsel, confrontation of witnesses, subpoena power — the full array of rights to challenge the government’s indictment.

russia,Reuters,1,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-senate-mueller/us-senators-clash-with-republican-leader-over-protecting-mueller-idUSKCN1NJ2EK,U.S. senators clash with Republican leader over protecting Mueller,2018-11-15,David Morgan,"WASHINGTON ( ███ ) - A lone Republican lawmaker on Wednesday vowed to block judicial nominations in the U.S. Senate until Republican leader Mitch McConnell agrees to hold a vote on a measure to protect a probe into Russia ’ s role in the 2016 presidential election .
Senator Jeff Flake made the threat after McConnell blocked Flake ’ s measure from moving forward . The Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act would make it harder for President Donald Trump to undermine the investigation into Russian meddling and any coordination between Moscow and the Trump campaign .
Moscow denies interfering and Trump has repeatedly dismissed Special Counsel Robert Mueller ’ s investigation as a political witch hunt .
“ I will not vote to advance any of the 21 judicial nominees pending in the Judiciary Committee , or vote to confirm the 32 judges awaiting confirmation on the Senate floor until ( the bill ) is brought to the full Senate , ” Flake said in a floor speech after his effort to win consent for a vote failed .
Flake , who is retiring from the Senate , used the same strategy earlier this year to obtain a Senate vote on an amendment to rein in Trump ’ s power to impose tariffs on foreign goods .
His vote is especially crucial on the 21-member Senate Judiciary Committee , which Republicans control by only a single seat . But Flake could also make life difficult for McConnell on actions in the 100-seat Senate , which Republicans control by only a 51-49 seat margin through the end of the year .
McConnell has maintained for months that there is no danger to Mueller ’ s investigation .
“ I don ’ t think any legislation is necessary , ” he told reporters after winning his bid to remain Senate Republican leader .

“ We know how the president feels about the ... investigation , but he ’ s never said he wants to shut it down , ” McConnell said .
However , on Aug. 1 , Trump appealed to then-U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions to end the investigation , sending the following message on Twitter : “ This is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now . ”
McConnell came to the Senate floor himself to prevent Flake ’ s bill from moving forward .
Flake and Democratic Senator Chris Coons , also part of the effort to obtain a vote to protect Mueller , said they would continue to seek legislative action and could push to have a measure included in a government spending bill later this year .
A week ago , Trump set off alarm bells among Democrats and some Republicans by forcing the resignation of Sessions and replacing him with Matthew Whitaker , a Trump loyalist who has criticized the Mueller probe as too far-reaching .
Critics of the Whitaker appointment say that , as acting attorney general , he could fire Mueller or undermine the Russian meddling investigation in some other way .
The bill backed by Flake and Coons would ensure that Mueller could be fired only for good cause and provide him with recourse to challenge any dismissal in federal court . It was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee in a 14-7 vote in April .
It is supported by the panel ’ s chairman Chuck Grassley , as well as prominent Senator Lindsey Graham . Both are Republicans .
It is also backed by Democrats . “ We want to make sure that the acting attorney general does not interfere with the Mueller investigation , and we believe our Republican colleagues can join us , ” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told reporters .
Flake said there were enough votes to pass the bill . He said there would be repeated efforts to bring it to a vote despite McConnell .","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A lone Republican lawmaker on Wednesday vowed to block judicial nominations in the U.S. Senate until Republican leader Mitch McConnell agrees to hold a vote on a measure to protect a probe into Russia’s role in the 2016 presidential election.

Senator Jeff Flake made the threat after McConnell blocked Flake’s measure from moving forward. The Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act would make it harder for President Donald Trump to undermine the investigation into Russian meddling and any coordination between Moscow and the Trump campaign.

Moscow denies interfering and Trump has repeatedly dismissed Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation as a political witch hunt.

“I will not vote to advance any of the 21 judicial nominees pending in the Judiciary Committee, or vote to confirm the 32 judges awaiting confirmation on the Senate floor until (the bill) is brought to the full Senate,” Flake said in a floor speech after his effort to win consent for a vote failed.

Flake, who is retiring from the Senate, used the same strategy earlier this year to obtain a Senate vote on an amendment to rein in Trump’s power to impose tariffs on foreign goods.

His vote is especially crucial on the 21-member Senate Judiciary Committee, which Republicans control by only a single seat. But Flake could also make life difficult for McConnell on actions in the 100-seat Senate, which Republicans control by only a 51-49 seat margin through the end of the year.

McConnell has maintained for months that there is no danger to Mueller’s investigation.

“I don’t think any legislation is necessary,” he told reporters after winning his bid to remain Senate Republican leader.

“We know how the president feels about the ... investigation, but he’s never said he wants to shut it down,” McConnell said.

However, on Aug. 1, Trump appealed to then-U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions to end the investigation, sending the following message on Twitter: “This is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now.”

McConnell came to the Senate floor himself to prevent Flake’s bill from moving forward.

Flake and Democratic Senator Chris Coons, also part of the effort to obtain a vote to protect Mueller, said they would continue to seek legislative action and could push to have a measure included in a government spending bill later this year.

The future of Donald Trump ’ s presidency could hinge on whether the answer to that question is yes .
That ’ s because the claim that such a meeting happened is one of the most specific claims in Christopher Steele ’ s dossier alleging collusion between the Trump team and Russia to influence the 2016 election — and because , since the very first day that dossier was publicly released , Cohen has adamantly denied taking any such trip , and Trump ’ s team has relied on that denial to dispute the dossier ’ s accuracy . “ I have never been to Prague in my life . # fakenews , ” Cohen tweeted on January 10 , 2017 , hours after the dossier was posted .
Yet a new report from McClatchy ’ s Peter Stone and Greg Gordon claims that special counsel Robert Mueller has evidence that Cohen did , in fact , enter Prague through Germany at the height of the 2016 campaign , in “ August or early September . ”
The McClatchy report is based on anonymous sources , and we don ’ t yet know what the purported evidence is . It could still prove to be mistaken . Cohen himself reiterated his denial again Saturday morning , telling CNN , “ No , I have never been to Prague , ” and sending this tweet rebutting the story :

If the McClatchy report was accurate , it would utterly devastate one of the Trump team ’ s leading arguments that there was no Trump-Russia collusion . That ’ s because , to be blunt , there is no reason for Cohen to try to debunk the Steele dossier by lying and saying that he didn ’ t visit Prague at all if he actually did , unless he was trying to cover up extremely serious wrongdoing that happened during that visit .
If Cohen did in fact visit Prague in 2016 , but for innocuous reasons that Steele ’ s sources twisted , he could have just said that at the time . Instead , he vociferously denied that he went to Prague at all . If that was false , there would be no reason for him to take that tack — unless he was trying to cover up something very serious and hoping to get away with it . ( However , we should note again that the McClatchy report remains unconfirmed by other outlets at this point . )
Yet the story gets even weirder . Cohen has insisted since January 2017 that he ’ s never been to Prague , but Mother Jones ’ s David Corn writes that , a few months before that , Cohen told him he in fact was in Prague “ for one afternoon 14 years ago. ” So at the very least Cohen has been inconsistent on whether he ’ s ever been to the city .
What the Steele dossier alleged about Michael Cohen visiting Prague
The Steele dossier , you will remember , was a months-long research project in which former MI6 agent Christopher Steele dug into Donald Trump ’ s connections to Russia . Steele was paid by the firm Fusion GPS , which was paid by a lawyer for the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee .
The dossier , as publicly released , is a series of 17 reports written over six months , based on a plethora of sources , that allege deep and corrupt ties between Trump and Russian officials .
Cohen emerges as a major character in the final set of reports . In one dated October 19 , 2016 , Steele wrote ( emphasis added ) :
Speaking in confidence to a longstanding compatriot friend in mid-October 2016 , a Kremlin insider highlighted the importance of Republican presidential candidate Donald TRUMP ’ s lawyer , Michael COHEN , in the ongoing secret liaison relationship between the New York tycoon ’ s campaign and the Russian leadership . COHEN ’ s role had grown following the departure of Paul MANNAFORT [ sic ] as TRUMP ’ s campaign manager in August 2016 . Prior to that MANNAFORT had led for the Trump side . According to the Kremlin insider , COHEN now was heavily engaged in a cover up and damage limitation operation in the attempt to prevent the full details of TRUMP ’ s relationship with Russia being exposed . In pursuit of this aim , COHEN had met secretly with several Russian Presidential Administration ( PA ) Legal Department officials in an EU country in August 2016 . The immediate issues had been to contain further scandals involving MANNAFORT ’ s commercial and political role in Russia/Ukraine and to limit the damage arising from exposure of former TRUMP foreign policy advisor , Carter PAGE ’ s secret meetings with Russian leadership figures in Moscow the previous month . The overall objective had been “ to sweep it all under the carpet and make sure no connections could be fully established or proven . ”
Then in a report dated the next day , October 20 , Steele gave more specifics . He said Cohen ’ s “ clandestine meeting ” with Russian officials was in Prague , and mentioned a Russian NGO , Rossotrudnichestvo , as a potential host for the meeting .
The final report in the published Steele dossier , dated December 13 ( after Trump was elected president ) , reiterated the claim of a Cohen/Prague meeting — now saying it happened in August or September 2016 — and gave many more supposed specifics ( emphasis added ) :
COHEN had been accompanied to Prague by 3 colleagues and the timing of the visit was either in the last week of August or the first week of September . One of their main Russian interlocutors was Oleg SOLODUKHIN operating under Rossotrudnichestvo cover . According to [ redacted ] , the agenda comprised questions on how deniable cash payments were to be made to hackers who had worked in Europe under Kremlin direction against the CLINTON campaign and various contingencies for covering up these operations and Moscow ’ s secret liaison with the TRUMP team more generally .
The report claims that Cohen discussed how to destroy evidence of this purported hacking operation in the event of a Clinton victory .
These are , of course , highly inflammatory claims that a Trump Organization executive and lawyer was collaborating closely with Russian government officials regarding paying hackers who had worked against the Clinton campaign in some way . But for 15 months after the dossier ’ s publication , no evidence emerged that this had actually taken place .
Cohen immediately tried to use the “ Prague visit ” claim to debunk the dossier
On January 10 , 2017 — 10 days before Donald Trump ’ s inauguration — CNN reported that Trump had been briefed on the claims of the Steele dossier , and BuzzFeed News subsequently published the dossier itself .
Some time went by without any comment from Trump ’ s teams on the shocking allegations . And then Michael Cohen spoke up :
I have never been to Prague in my life . # fakenews pic.twitter.com/CMil9Rha3D — Michael Cohen ( @ MichaelCohen212 ) January 11 , 2017
Immediately , many observed it was strange that Cohen attempted to debunk the dossier by tweeting a picture of the cover of his passport , rather than its interior . Additionally , since Prague is in the European Union ’ s Schengen Area , which allows passport-free travel between countries , he could theoretically have gotten an initial entry stamp from any EU country , not just the Czech Republic . It ’ s also possible for one person to have multiple passports .
But the claim that Cohen visited Prague was a very specific one that showed up in a few different dossier reports . If it in fact was wrong , it would discredit the dossier as a whole ( though there are many different sources quoted in the dossier , and even if many are accurate , it ’ s possible that others are wrong ) . Most importantly , Cohen deliberately chose to make a denial that he visited Prague his main argument in disputing the dossier .
A few months later , in May 2017 , Cohen decided to share more . BuzzFeed News asked to see the inside of his passport , so he showed it to Anthony Cormier , a reporter for the site . The provided passport revealed just one trip inside the Schengen Area — to Italy , in July , which doesn ’ t quite match the timeline laid out in the dossier . Cohen claimed to them that this was his only passport . And for several months afterward , that is where things remained .
Now , the new McClatchy report by Stone and Gordon claims Mueller has evidence that Cohen “ secretly made a late-summer trip to Prague. ” They write that , per their anonymous sources , “ investigators have traced evidence that Cohen entered the Czech Republic through Germany , apparently during August or early September of 2016 , as the ex-spy reported . ”
If Stone and Gordon are right , it of course wouldn ’ t tell us what Cohen actually did in Prague . Yet it would raise enormous questions about why he would have lied so brazenly about the trip , and made that lie the centerpiece of the Trump team ’ s efforts to discredit the Steele dossier . It ’ s very difficult indeed to think of an innocent explanation for why Cohen — whose office was raided by the FBI this week — would have done so .
Another possibility , though , is that Cohen ’ s denial of a Prague visit is in fact technically correct , but misleading in some respect — after all , his denials have been very specific to the city of Prague itself , which would seem to leave open the possibility of a similar meeting to the one alleged that took place in some other nearby city or town .
Finally , it ’ s also possible that Cohen is on the level here , and both Steele ’ s dossier and the new McClatchy report are just flat-out wrong . Suffice to say , though , we haven ’ t heard the last of this topic .","Did Trump lawyer Michael Cohen secretly visit Prague to meet with Russians in 2016?

Kazianis,"Heading into his summit in Finland Monday with Russian President Vladimir Putin , President Trump has an important goal : improve relations with the world ’ s second-ranked nuclear power – but only if doing so will benefit the United States .
“ Getting along with Russia would be a good thing , not a bad thing , ” the U.S. president said in April – a sentiment he has voiced many times before and since , going back to his days as a presidential candidate .
President Trump – despite what his critics say – is not a naïve fool who will sell out the United States and our allies and make ridiculous concessions to Putin . And he understands that improving relations with Russia and changing Russian behavior is no easy task . But he also believes it ’ s worth a try .
The plain truth is that Russia is too big and too important a nation for any U.S. president to simply refuse to deal with . And because of that , it ’ s to our mutual benefit for America and Russia to no longer be enemies .
Sure , our interests don ’ t overlap enough to consider a wide-ranging partnership or an alliance . But we can work together on some things , even if we will inevitably be opposed on others .
The truth is , the bitter distrust and hatred shared by many in Moscow and Washington today should have ended with the Cold War . But unfortunately , this didn ’ t happen . Russia and America now find themselves trying to repair the most broken of relationships .
I can ’ t help but wonder if this might have all been avoided . History tells us there could have been a different path , especially for Russia , if a fundamental question was answered once and for all : what is Russia ’ s place in the world ?
Right now we seem destined to repeat a dangerous cycle of U.S.-Russia tensions reminiscent of the darkest days of the Cold War .
Does Russia belong in the West , thanks to a shared cultural and religious foundation , joining institutions like the European Union or even NATO ?
Or is Russia so unique that it is a civilization separate from the West , thanks to its large territory straddling Europe and Asia ? Does that mean Russia and the West will be locked in a clash of civilizations for all time ?
Having grown up in the early 1990s , I was one of many Americans who cheered for Russia to join the West – hoping to see an end to decades of strife with America and its allies , and a real conclusion to the Cold War .
This might even be what President Trump himself refers to when he talks about wanting a better relationship with Moscow . He surely remembers a time where the future seemed bright and it looked like West and East might no longer be divided .
It may sound foolish today to hope for good relations between the U.S. and Russia . But history tells us that the most bitter of enemies can become allies in a fairly short amount of time . Our friends and foes change with the years .
Look back to World War II – just a blink of the eye in the timeline of history . Germany , Italy and Japan were America ’ s mortal enemies – and the Soviet Union was our ally .
No one knows the exact number of people who died in that horrible conflict , but estimates are that over 60 million people lost their lives . Yet today , German , Italy and Japan are our allies – while Russia is our adversary .
And right now we seem destined to repeat a dangerous cycle of U.S.-Russia tensions reminiscent of the darkest days of the Cold War .
As he works to improve relations with Russia – cautiously , pragmatically and with his eyes wide open – President Trump should keep five important truths in mind heading into his summit with President Putin .
First , the Cold War never really ended – there was just a brief intermission .
A rogue Russia seems ready to confront the West at every turn . From invading parts of its old empire twice , to rebuilding its military might over the last decade , to attacking the foundations of our democracy through cyberwarfare , Moscow has made it clear : it will pursue its interests with great vigor – and isn ’ t afraid to take on America .
Second , the breakup of the Soviet Union was the geopolitical event of the last 50 years .
The Soviet flag stopped flying over the Kremlin on Christmas Day , 1991 . That was a historic Christmas present to our nation – the ultimate victory for us and our allies .
We should recall how the left cheered when President Obama tried to reset U.S.-Russia ties . They should , at the very least , give President Trump the space to see what is possible .
But the breakup still leaves the most bitter of tastes in most Russians mouths . Think how most Americans would feel if our nation suddenly broke up into 15 separate countries , as the Soviet Union did . How could this be anything but a traumatic experience ?
One of the most powerful empires of all time died overnight , leaving Russia economically broken and beaten – a nation that experienced one of the most rapid collapses in all of human history .
There is a bitterness in the hearts of many of Russia ’ s leaders , including Putin . A quest to reclaim past glory is clearly on his mind . And history tells us that can be a very dangerous thing indeed .
Third , no matter what those on the left say , America is clearly in a commanding position in any confrontation with Russia .
Russia is in a state of relative decline that won ’ t be easy to halt . Its economy is a tinderbox , thanks to Western economic sanctions , poor planning , and oligarchs who are more inclined to fill their own pockets than turn Russia into the economic powerhouse it should be .
As Sen. John McCain , R-Ariz. , pointed out some years ago , Russia is more of a giant gas station than anything else , with no global brands or truly innovative products to sell or showcase .
With declining demographics and real questions over who will succeed Putin when he leaves office , Russia is clearly a troubled state – and no match for a resurgent America .
Fourth , despite a history of rocky relations with the U.S. going back to the Russian Revolution in 1917 , there are areas of shared interest for our two nations to build on .
For example , both nations should work to end conflicts in Syria and Ukraine , which have been the cause of recent tensions in the U.S.-Russia relationship .
Moscow and Washington also have clear reasons to extend the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty ( START ) , which is set to expire in the next few years .
Both nations should also work together to establish rules of the road and a clear set of norms in cyberspace . Neither side has any interest in seeing conflicts waged on the Internet break out into a shooting war between nuclear superpowers .
Fifth , Washington must view the U.S.-Russia relationship in the context of a rising China – the true threat to America ’ s national interest for decades to come .
Moscow and Beijing share strong ties now . But over the long term , Russia is surely concerned about the future , as China grows ever stronger on its doorstep .
As China become more powerful and prosperous , it has sought to undo the post-World War II order in Asia . China feels that arrangement is outdated because it was crafted when China was weak and broken , part of a century of humiliation that must be atoned for .
From claiming parts of the sea as its own “ blue-water territory , ” trying to subjugate and diminish Taiwan ’ s democracy , and using its newfound economic military muscle to dominate Asia , Beijing seeks to turn the vast Indo-Pacific region into its own sphere of influence .
China , at some point , could turn its attention to the nearly empty stretches of land in Russia ’ s Far East , some of which were part of Chinese empires of the past . With vast tracts of land filled with nearly limitless natural resources on Beijing ’ s doorstep , Moscow would be wise to be wary – and consider stronger ties with America as an insurance policy of sorts .
As China and America buried decades of strife to take on the Soviet Union , we may someday see Moscow and Washington work together in the same way to contain Beijing ’ s future aspirations .
Finally , no matter what happens at the Trump-Putin summit Monday , all Americans should be rooting for President Trump . All of us benefit when there is dialogue between even the most bitter of adversaries – especially ones that have thousands of nuclear warheads that could turn our planet into atomic ash .
We should recall how the left cheered when President Obama tried to reset U.S.-Russia ties . They should , at the very least , give President Trump the space to see what is possible . But we know they won ’ t . And that is a real shame .","Heading into his summit in Finland Monday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, President Trump has an important goal: improve relations with the world’s second-ranked nuclear power – but only if doing so will benefit the United States.

“Getting along with Russia would be a good thing, not a bad thing,” the U.S. president said in April – a sentiment he has voiced many times before and since, going back to his days as a presidential candidate.

President Trump – despite what his critics say – is not a naïve fool who will sell out the United States and our allies and make ridiculous concessions to Putin. And he understands that improving relations with Russia and changing Russian behavior is no easy task. But he also believes it’s worth a try.

The plain truth is that Russia is too big and too important a nation for any U.S. president to simply refuse to deal with. And because of that, it’s to our mutual benefit for America and Russia to no longer be enemies.

Sure, our interests don’t overlap enough to consider a wide-ranging partnership or an alliance. But we can work together on some things, even if we will inevitably be opposed on others.

The truth is, the bitter distrust and hatred shared by many in Moscow and Washington today should have ended with the Cold War. But unfortunately, this didn’t happen. Russia and America now find themselves trying to repair the most broken of relationships.

I can’t help but wonder if this might have all been avoided. History tells us there could have been a different path, especially for Russia, if a fundamental question was answered once and for all: what is Russia’s place in the world?

Right now we seem destined to repeat a dangerous cycle of U.S.-Russia tensions reminiscent of the darkest days of the Cold War.

Does Russia belong in the West, thanks to a shared cultural and religious foundation, joining institutions like the European Union or even NATO?

Or is Russia so unique that it is a civilization separate from the West, thanks to its large territory straddling Europe and Asia? Does that mean Russia and the West will be locked in a clash of civilizations for all time?

Having grown up in the early 1990s, I was one of many Americans who cheered for Russia to join the West – hoping to see an end to decades of strife with America and its allies, and a real conclusion to the Cold War.

This might even be what President Trump himself refers to when he talks about wanting a better relationship with Moscow. He surely remembers a time where the future seemed bright and it looked like West and East might no longer be divided.

It may sound foolish today to hope for good relations between the U.S. and Russia. But history tells us that the most bitter of enemies can become allies in a fairly short amount of time. Our friends and foes change with the years.

Look back to World War II – just a blink of the eye in the timeline of history. Germany, Italy and Japan were America’s mortal enemies – and the Soviet Union was our ally.

Lynch,"ALEXANDRIA , Va. ( ███ ) - A federal judge said Special Counsel Robert Mueller should not have “ unfettered power ” in probing ties between President Donald Trump ’ s campaign and Russia , and accused Mueller of using criminal cases to pressure Trump ’ s allies to turn against him .
At a tense hearing in a federal court in Virginia on Friday , U.S. District Judge T.S . Ellis III sharply questioned whether Mueller exceeded his authority in filing tax and bank fraud charges against Trump ’ s former campaign manager , Paul Manafort .
Ellis said the indictment appeared to be a way for Mueller to leverage Manafort into providing information about Trump .
“ You don ’ t really care about Mr. Manafort , ” the judge said . “ You really care about what information Mr. Manafort can give you to lead to Mr. Trump ” and his eventual prosecution or impeachment .
“ It ’ s unlikely you ’ re going to persuade me the special counsel has unfettered power to do whatever he wants , ” Ellis , who was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan , said at a hearing on Manafort ’ s motion to dismiss the Virginia charges .
Manafort , who served as Trump ’ s campaign manager for five months , also faces federal charges in Washington , where he is accused of conspiring to launder money and failing to register as a foreign agent when he lobbied for the pro-Russia Ukrainian government .
Michael Dreeben , a deputy solicitor general working with Mueller , argued the special counsel ’ s investigative scope covered the activity in the indictment .
In an Aug. 2 , 2017 , memo , Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein authorized Mueller to investigate whether Manafort “ committed a crime or crimes arising out of payments he received from the Ukrainian government before and during the tenure of President Viktor Yanukovych . ”
The former Ukrainian leader was removed from power and fled to Russia in February 2014 , more than two years before Trump declared his candidacy for president .
Trump enthusiastically read the judge ’ s comments out loud to his audience during a speech to the National Rifle Association in Dallas , saying they echoed his longstanding views . He called Ellis “ a very respected person . ”
“ I ’ ve been saying that for a long time . It ’ s a witch hunt , ” he said of Mueller ’ s probe into his campaign ’ s ties to Russia and whether it colluded with Russians to interfere in the 2016 election .
He also distanced himself from Manafort , calling him a nice guy but saying “ he worked for me for a very short period of time . ”
The sharp tone of the judge ’ s comments could spell trouble for Mueller ’ s case against Manafort and put even greater pressure on Rosenstein to rein in the Russia investigation .
But several legal experts cautioned against reading too much into the comments .
“ I think there are some judges that believe that in being evenhanded , they should give the winner a hard time , too , ” said James Trusty , a former federal prosecutor now with the law firm Ifrah Law . “ At the end of the day , it ’ s very dangerous to read the tea leaves from comments from the bench . ”
Lisa Kern Griffin , a professor at Duke University School of Law and a former federal prosecutor , said it is unlikely Ellis will dismiss the charges against Manafort because bringing them was “ almost certainly ” within Mueller ’ s broad authority .
If Ellis dismissed the charges , they would likely be reinstated by an appeals court , Griffin said . “ I think Judge Ellis may just be putting to the government through its paces , ” she said . “ That is not uncommon . ”
The hearing on Friday was the third time Manafort has tried to get charges against him dismissed . A civil case alleging the Justice Department ’ s order appointing Mueller was overly broad was tossed last month .
He also asked for dismissal of the Washington-based criminal charges on similar legal grounds , but there has not been a ruling .
Ellis did not rule on the motion to dismiss on Friday .
Ellis asked why a run-of-the-mill bank fraud case with no “ reference to any Russian individual or Russian bank ” could not be handed over to the U.S. Attorney ’ s Office in the Eastern District of Virginia .
As an example , he pointed to the FBI probe into Trump ’ s personal lawyer , Michael Cohen , and said the special counsel had turned that matter over to federal prosecutors in Manhattan .
Ellis also complained that the bulk of that August memo he received was highly redacted . He told Mueller ’ s office to take two weeks to consult with U.S. intelligence agencies to see whether they would sign off so that he can personally review a sealed , unredacted version of the memo .

russia,Fox Online News,2,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mueller-submits-long-awaited-russia-probe-report-to-justice-department,Mueller submits long-awaited Russia probe report to Justice Department,,Elizabeth Zwirz,"Special Counsel Robert Mueller has submitted to Attorney General Bill Barr his long-awaited report on the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential race and possible collusion with Trump associates -- marking the end of the politically explosive probe and the beginning of a new battle over its contents and implications .
Mueller is `` not recommending any further indictments , '' a senior DOJ official told Fox News .
The report was delivered Friday afternoon to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein ’ s office and it was delivered to Barr ’ s office within minutes , a senior DOJ official told Fox News . The White House was notified that the DOJ had received the report around 4:45 p.m. , before lawmakers on Capitol Hill were informed . Neither the White House nor Congress has seen the actual report .
Both Barr and Rosenstein have seen the report , according to a senior DOJ official .
White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders tweeted following the report 's submission .
`` The next steps are up to Attorney General Barr , and we look forward to the process taking its course , '' she said . `` The White House has not received or been briefed on the Special Counsel ’ s report . ''
Rudy Giuliani and Jay Sekulow , both of whom are counselors to Trump , also released a joint statement .
“ We ’ re pleased that the Office of Special Counsel has delivered its report to the attorney general pursuant to the regulations , '' the statement said . `` Attorney General Barr will determine the appropriate next steps . ”
Following word that Mueller was not recommending more indictments , Giuliani told Fox News that they were `` confident '' the investigation would show there was no collusion .
“ This marks the end of the Russia investigation . We await a disclosure of the facts , '' he said . `` We are confident that there is no finding of collusion by the President and this underscores what the President has been saying from the beginning - that he did nothing wrong . ”
Several lawmakers , including Sens . Lindsey Graham , R-S.C. and Dianne Feinstein , D-Calif. , received a letter about the report 's submisision . Graham is the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee . Feinstein is the ranking member .
“ Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III has concluded his investigation of the Russian interference in the 2016 election and related matters , '' the letter said .
Barr also said that he “ may be in a position to advise you of the Special Counsel ’ s principal conclusions as soon as this weekend . ”
“ Separately , I intend to consult with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Special Counsel Mueller to determine what other information from the report can be released to Congress and the public consistent with law , including the Special Counsel regulations , and the Department ’ s long-standing practices and policies , '' it continued .
In the letter Barr sent to lawmakers , he wrote that Mueller did not act inappropriately while conducting the probe .
`` In addition to this notification , the Special Counsel regulations require that I provide you with a 'description and explanation of instances ( if any ) in which the Attorney General ' or acting Attorney General 'concluded that a proposed action by a Special Counsel was so inappropriate or unwarranted under established Departmental practices that it should not be pursued , ' '' Barr wrote . `` There were no such instances during the Special Counsel 's investigation . ''
Graham released a statement , confirming that he and Feinstein had been informed of the report 's submission , which he said signaled that Barr `` will pursue as much transparency as possible . ''
`` Importantly , the notification also indicates that there were no areas of disagreement between the Attorney General or the Acting Attorney General and Special Counsel Mueller regarding courses of action , '' he said . `` This information is specifically required to be disclosed by the regulations governing Special Counsel reports . ''
Graham anticipates that both he and Feinstein will receive further briefing about the report , he said .
`` I have always believed it was important that Mr. Mueller be allowed to do his job without interference , and that has been accomplished , '' the statement said .
It ’ s not clear how much , if any , of the report will be made public or provided to Congress . None of Mueller ’ s findings were immediately released .
The president has repeatedly decried Mueller ’ s probe as a “ witch hunt , ” emphatically denying he or his campaign colluded with Russia to undermine Democrat Hillary Clinton ’ s chances in the 2016 race . The president has alleged a slew of internal “ conflicts of interest ” from Mueller ’ s team and has previously said his legal team is drafting a “ major counter report ” in response to its findings .
Mueller ’ s investigation , which was initially ordered to look into the 2016 election in May of 2017 , has gone on for almost two years . It has expanded to probe financial crimes of Trump associates before the election , conversations Trump ’ s national security adviser had with the Russians during the transition and whether Trump obstructed justice with his comments and actions related to the probe .
Mueller , the former director of the FBI under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama , was appointed special counsel by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in May of 2017 . In his order , Rosenstein directed Mueller to investigate any links or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign , as well as any other matters that arose from the investigation .
“ If the Special Counsel believes it is necessary and appropriate , the Special Counsel is authorized to prosecute federal crimes arising from the investigation of these matters , ” Rosenstein wrote to Mueller .
Since then , Mueller ’ s team has indicted , convicted , or won guilty pleas from 34 people and three companies as part of an investigation that has also probed issues unrelated to the 2016 campaign .
Twenty six Russian nationals and three Russian companies have been charged with interfering in the 2016 presidential election .
But none of the Trump associates connected to Trump have been charged with crimes related to collusion , though Mueller ’ s team charged former Trump associate Roger Stone in January with lying about his communications with WikiLeaks , which published hacked Democratic emails during the election .
Other convictions include : former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos , who both pleaded guilty to making false statements in 2017 .
Former campaign adviser Rick Gates in 2018 pleaded guilty and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort was convicted and later pleaded guilty in a separate financial crimes case dating back before the 2016 election .
Former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to making false statements in a case brought by Mueller in November .
Alex van der Zwaan , a London-based lawyer , pleaded guilty to making false statements this year , and Richard Pinedo , a California man , pleaded guilty to identity fraud in 2018 .

Mueller is ""not recommending any further indictments,"" a senior DOJ official told Fox News.

The report was delivered Friday afternoon to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein’s office and it was delivered to Barr’s office within minutes, a senior DOJ official told Fox News. The White House was notified that the DOJ had received the report around 4:45 p.m., before lawmakers on Capitol Hill were informed. Neither the White House nor Congress has seen the actual report.

Both Barr and Rosenstein have seen the report, according to a senior DOJ official.

White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders tweeted following the report's submission.

""The next steps are up to Attorney General Barr, and we look forward to the process taking its course,"" she said. ""The White House has not received or been briefed on the Special Counsel’s report.""

Rudy Giuliani and Jay Sekulow, both of whom are counselors to Trump, also released a joint statement.

“We’re pleased that the Office of Special Counsel has delivered its report to the attorney general pursuant to the regulations,"" the statement said. ""Attorney General Barr will determine the appropriate next steps.”

Following word that Mueller was not recommending more indictments, Giuliani told Fox News that they were ""confident"" the investigation would show there was no collusion.

“This marks the end of the Russia investigation. We await a disclosure of the facts,"" he said. ""We are confident that there is no finding of collusion by the President and this underscores what the President has been saying from the beginning - that he did nothing wrong.”

Several lawmakers, including Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. and Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., received a letter about the report's submisision. Graham is the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Feinstein is the ranking member.

“Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III has concluded his investigation of the Russian interference in the 2016 election and related matters,"" the letter said.

Barr also said that he “may be in a position to advise you of the Special Counsel’s principal conclusions as soon as this weekend.”

“Separately, I intend to consult with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Special Counsel Mueller to determine what other information from the report can be released to Congress and the public consistent with law, including the Special Counsel regulations, and the Department’s long-standing practices and policies,"" it continued.

In the letter Barr sent to lawmakers, he wrote that Mueller did not act inappropriately while conducting the probe.

""In addition to this notification, the Special Counsel regulations require that I provide you with a 'description and explanation of instances (if any) in which the Attorney General' or acting Attorney General 'concluded that a proposed action by a Special Counsel was so inappropriate or unwarranted under established Departmental practices that it should not be pursued,'"" Barr wrote. ""There were no such instances during the Special Counsel's investigation.""

Graham released a statement, confirming that he and Feinstein had been informed of the report's submission, which he said signaled that Barr ""will pursue as much transparency as possible.""

""Importantly, the notification also indicates that there were no areas of disagreement between the Attorney General or the Acting Attorney General and Special Counsel Mueller regarding courses of action,"" he said. ""This information is specifically required to be disclosed by the regulations governing Special Counsel reports.""

Graham anticipates that both he and Feinstein will receive further briefing about the report, he said.

""I have always believed it was important that Mr. Mueller be allowed to do his job without interference, and that has been accomplished,"" the statement said.

It’s not clear how much, if any, of the report will be made public or provided to Congress. None of Mueller’s findings were immediately released.

The president has repeatedly decried Mueller’s probe as a “witch hunt,” emphatically denying he or his campaign colluded with Russia to undermine Democrat Hillary Clinton’s chances in the 2016 race. The president has alleged a slew of internal “conflicts of interest” from Mueller’s team and has previously said his legal team is drafting a “major counter report” in response to its findings.

Mueller’s investigation, which was initially ordered to look into the 2016 election in May of 2017, has gone on for almost two years. It has expanded to probe financial crimes of Trump associates before the election, conversations Trump’s national security adviser had with the Russians during the transition and whether Trump obstructed justice with his comments and actions related to the probe.

Mueller, the former director of the FBI under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, was appointed special counsel by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in May of 2017. In his order, Rosenstein directed Mueller to investigate any links or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign, as well as any other matters that arose from the investigation.

“If the Special Counsel believes it is necessary and appropriate, the Special Counsel is authorized to prosecute federal crimes arising from the investigation of these matters,” Rosenstein wrote to Mueller.

Since then, Mueller’s team has indicted, convicted, or won guilty pleas from 34 people and three companies as part of an investigation that has also probed issues unrelated to the 2016 campaign.

Twenty six Russian nationals and three Russian companies have been charged with interfering in the 2016 presidential election.

But none of the Trump associates connected to Trump have been charged with crimes related to collusion, though Mueller’s team charged former Trump associate Roger Stone in January with lying about his communications with WikiLeaks, which published hacked Democratic emails during the election.

Other convictions include: former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, who both pleaded guilty to making false statements in 2017.

Former campaign adviser Rick Gates in 2018 pleaded guilty and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort was convicted and later pleaded guilty in a separate financial crimes case dating back before the 2016 election.

Former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to making false statements in a case brought by Mueller in November.

Alex van der Zwaan, a London-based lawyer, pleaded guilty to making false statements this year, and Richard Pinedo, a California man, pleaded guilty to identity fraud in 2018.

Mueller has also looked at actions taken by Trump after he was sworn in as president, like his firing of FBI director James Comey and his ousting of Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

Sessions, once one of President Trump’s most loyal and trusted advisers infuriated Trump over his recusal from the Russia investigation. In March 2017, Sessions announced his plans to recuse himself after reports surfaced detailing undisclosed conversations with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the campaign.

Rosenstein, Sessions’ number two at the Justice Department, then took control of the investigation and decided to appoint Mueller to take over the probe.

Rosenstein said at the time, “What I have determined is that based upon the unique circumstances the public interest requires me to place this investigation under the authority of a person who exercises a degree of independence from the normal chain of command.”

Mueller said in a statement, upon his appointment: “I accept this responsibility and will discharge it to the best of my ability.’’

Rosenstein later ceded oversight to then-acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker when he took over for Sessions. But the report was submitted to Barr, who was confirmed in February by the Senate as attorney general.

The Russian rouble has slumped to its lowest level since November 2016, hours after the US announced new sanctions because of the poisoning of an ex-Russian spy and his daughter in the UK.

The dollar-rouble rate reached 66.7 on the Moscow stock exchange. On Tuesday the rate had been 63.4.

Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned with the Russian nerve agent Novichok in Salisbury in March, though they have now recovered.

Russia denies any role in the attack.

Russia likely to resist

Analysis by Gary O'Donoghue, BBC News, Washington

After pressure from Republican members of Congress, the state department has determined Moscow broke international law by using a military-grade chemical weapon on the Skripals.

While the US expelled some five dozen diplomats shortly after the poisoning, the administration stopped short of making a formal determination that Russia had broken international law.

But Congress has been pushing for such a decision and now the state department has confirmed Russia's actions contravened 1991 US legislation on the use of chemical weapons. That breach automatically triggers the imposition of sanctions and places requirements on Russia to avert further restrictions in three months' time.

So far President Donald Trump has been silent on this latest move - which could well derail his attempts to develop a new, warmer relationship with Vladimir Putin.

What was the nerve agent?

Following the incident, the British government said the military-grade nerve agent Novichok, of a type developed by Russia, had been used in the attack.

Relations between Russia and the West hit a new low. More than 20 countries expelled Russian envoys in solidarity with the UK, including the US. Washington ordered 60 diplomats to leave and closed the Russian consulate-general in Seattle.

Three months after the Salisbury attack, two other people fell ill at a house in Amesbury, about eight miles from the city. Dawn Sturgess later died while her partner, Charlie Rowley, spent three weeks recovering in hospital.

Russia ’ s foreign ministry said in a statement it had summoned U.K. ambassador Laurie Bristow to inform him that the 23 diplomats were now `` persona non grata '' and had a week to leave . The ministry announced it was also closing the British consulate in Saint Petersburg and withdrawing the right of the British Council , a body that promotes British culture and language , to operate in Russia .
The Russian foreign ministry said it was taking the measures in response to what it called the U.K. ’ s “ provocative actions and unfounded accusations ” over the poisoning case .

The U.K. has accused Russia of bearing responsibility for the attack , which British officials say involved a military-grade nerve agent of a type developed secretly by Russia . British Prime Minister Theresa May has also cut off high-level contacts with Russia and has been trying to build support among the U.K. ’ s allies for potential fresh sanctions to punish Russia .
Speaking after being briefed by the U.K. ambassador , May said her government had anticipated the Russian response and said : `` We will consider our next steps in the coming days , alongside our allies and partners . ''
`` But Russia ’ s response doesn ’ t change the facts of the matter , '' May told the Conservative Party Spring Forum in London . `` The attempted assassination of two people on British soil , for which there is no alternative conclusion other than that the Russian State was culpable . It is Russia that is in flagrant breach of international law and the Chemical Weapons Convention . ''
Russia has denied the U.K. 's allegations , accusing Britain of using the incident in a campaign to smear Moscow . The official Russian response in the past few days has graduated from accusing the British of a rush to judgment to alleging more directly that the U.K. or the United States could have created the nerve agent used in the attack .
U.K. officials have said a nerve agent from Russia ’ s so-called Novichok program was used to target Skripal . First revealed by a Russian whistleblower in the early 1990s , the Novichok nerve agents were part of a secret Russian effort to develop a new generation of more powerful and harder to detect nerve agents .
Russia has now denied that any program under the name Novichok ever existed , despite the evidence presented two decades ago by the Russian scientist Vil Mirzayanov , who revealed Russia was developing the weapons after becoming concerned it violated the country 's commitments to the Chemical Weapons Convention . Some Russian officials had previously said that Russia had destroyed the Novichok weapons when it had dismantled its chemical arsenal , which was completed last year .
On Saturday , though , a spokesman for Russia 's Foreign ministry , Maria Zakharova , alleged that the nerve agent used in the attack `` most likely '' had been produced in either the U.K. or the United States , or Sweden , Slovakia or the Czech Republic .
`` The most probable source of this chemical is those countries which at the end of the 1990s that were conducting intensive research on the substance from the 'Novichok ' project . That is Britain , Slovakia , the Czech Republic , Sweden , '' said Zakharova , according to the state news agency , TASS . `` The US also needs to be put under question , '' she said .
The Czech Republic 's foreign minister , Martin Stropnicky , denied Zakharova 's claims , writing on Twitter , `` this is a standard way of manipulating information in the public space through a highly speculative message being introduced which can not be proven , '' Reuters reported .
After the expulsions were announced , the chairman of the UK parliament 's foreign affairs committee said that the Russian measures also hurt the Russian people .
“ It ’ s a great shame for the Russian people that they ’ re closing the British Council , which has done an awful lot to educate Russian people in English language and help them get jobs and opportunities around the world , ” Conservative party Member of Parliament Tom Tugendhat said on BBC Radio 4 . The British Council runs language classes in Russia , and offers advise on studying and working in the UK .
The UK will now consider whether to take any further steps against Russia .
On Friday , the U.K. ’ s foreign minister , Boris Johnson , blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin personally for the attack , telling an audience , “ We think it overwhelmingly likely that it was his decision to direct the use of a nerve agent on the streets of the U.K. , on the streets of Europe , for the first time since the second World War . ”
The Skripals remain in a critical condition following the attack that also poisoned a British police officer . The officer is reportedly now in stable condition .
Sergey Skripal worked as a spy for Britain ’ s MI6 agency while serving in Russian military intelligence in the late 1990s . He was arrested and convicted of treason by Russia , but was pardoned and exchanged in a spy swap in 2010 , after which he lived the U.K . The case has drawn obvious parallels with the murder of Alexander Litvinenko , a dissident former Russian intelligence officer who was killed with a radioactive poison in London in 2006 . A British public inquiry found Putin had “ probably ” ordered that assassination .
Meanwhile , U.K. police have also opened a murder investigation in the death of another Russian exile living in Britain . Nikolai Glushkov was found dead at his home this week . Police said Glushkov died as a result of a “ compression of the neck , ” suggesting he may have been strangled .
Glushkov was an associate of oligarch and Putin foe Boris Berezovsky , who was also found dead in 2013 , apparently having hung himself , though a coroner recorded an open verdict . Glushkov was granted political asylum in London after he was released from prison in Russia in 2004 , where he had been jailed over fraud charges .
London ’ s Metropolitan police counter-terrorism command has said there is no suggestion that Glushkov ’ s death is connected to the poisoning attack , but that they are investigating because “ of associations Mr Glushkov is believed to have had. ” Detectives are keeping an `` open mind '' about the death , police said .","Russia expelled 23 British diplomats on Saturday in a tit-for-tat response to the U.K.’s expulsion of 23 Russian embassy staff over the nerve-agent attack in England last week.

The official Russian response in the past few days has graduated from accusing the British of a rush to judgment to alleging more directly that the U.K. or the United States could have created the nerve agent used in the attack.

""The most probable source of this chemical is those countries which at the end of the 1990s that were conducting intensive research on the substance from the 'Novichok' project. That is Britain, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Sweden,"" said Zakharova, according to the state news agency, TASS. ""The US also needs to be put under question,"" she said.

The Czech Republic's foreign minister, Martin Stropnicky, denied Zakharova's claims, writing on Twitter, ""this is a standard way of manipulating information in the public space through a highly speculative message being introduced which can not be proven,"" Reuters reported.

After the expulsions were announced, the chairman of the UK parliament's foreign affairs committee said that the Russian measures also hurt the Russian people.

“It’s a great shame for the Russian people that they’re closing the British Council, which has done an awful lot to educate Russian people in English language and help them get jobs and opportunities around the world,” Conservative party Member of Parliament Tom Tugendhat said on BBC Radio 4. The British Council runs language classes in Russia, and offers advise on studying and working in the UK.

The UK will now consider whether to take any further steps against Russia.

On Friday, the U.K.’s foreign minister, Boris Johnson, blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin personally for the attack, telling an audience, “We think it overwhelmingly likely that it was his decision to direct the use of a nerve agent on the streets of the U.K., on the streets of Europe, for the first time since the second World War.”

The Skripals remain in a critical condition following the attack that also poisoned a British police officer. The officer is reportedly now in stable condition.

Sergey Skripal worked as a spy for Britain’s MI6 agency while serving in Russian military intelligence in the late 1990s. He was arrested and convicted of treason by Russia, but was pardoned and exchanged in a spy swap in 2010, after which he lived the U.K. The case has drawn obvious parallels with the murder of Alexander Litvinenko, a dissident former Russian intelligence officer who was killed with a radioactive poison in London in 2006. A British public inquiry found Putin had “probably” ordered that assassination.

Meanwhile, U.K. police have also opened a murder investigation in the death of another Russian exile living in Britain. Nikolai Glushkov was found dead at his home this week. Police said Glushkov died as a result of a “compression of the neck,” suggesting he may have been strangled.

Glushkov was an associate of oligarch and Putin foe Boris Berezovsky, who was also found dead in 2013, apparently having hung himself, though a coroner recorded an open verdict. Glushkov was granted political asylum in London after he was released from prison in Russia in 2004, where he had been jailed over fraud charges.

London’s Metropolitan police counter-terrorism command has said there is no suggestion that Glushkov’s death is connected to the poisoning attack, but that they are investigating because “of associations Mr Glushkov is believed to have had.” Detectives are keeping an ""open mind"" about the death, police said.",www.abcnews.go.com,left,GMQnr7LD1IVuSDq9

Interested in Russia ? Add Russia as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Russia news , video , and analysis from ███ . Add Interest
The Kremlin ’ s spokesman , Dmitry Peskov , however , told reporters Thursday that it was too early to talk about countersanctions and that Russia still hoped for `` constructive relations '' with the United States .
The State Department on Wednesday announced that the Trump administration was imposing mandatory new sanctions on Russia for violating a U.S. law prohibiting chemical and biological weapons . In March former Russian spy Sergey Skripal and his daughter , Yulia Skripal , were poisoned with a Soviet-designed nerve agent known as Novichok . The poison was smeared onto the front door of Skripal 's home in Salisbury , England , and U.K. authorities have blamed the assassination attempt on the Kremlin .
The new U.S. sanctions ban the export of any national security-sensitive goods or technology to Russia and will affect such products as gas turbine engines , electronic devices and equipment , circuits and calibration equipment . A senior State Department official estimated the sanctions could affect hundreds of millions of dollars in trade with Russia .
More worrying for Russia , however , is that the law cited by the administration includes a second provision that will impose a second round of far more punishing sanctions on Moscow if it now fails to comply with the legislation within 90 days .
The Chemical and Biological Weapons and Warfare Elimination Act of 1991 requires that in order to avoid the next round of sanctions , Russia must prove it is not using chemical or biological weapons and allow impartial observers to verify compliance .
If Moscow violates the sanctions then it could see restrictions on flights from the Russian Aeroflot airline to the U.S. , sanctions on U.S. bank loans , increased export and import restrictions , including on gas and petroleum , and potentially even a downgrade of diplomatic relations .
Peskov on Thursday gave no indication that Russia would accept the U.S. criteria or permit any inspections .
“ We consider the tying of new restrictions -- which as previously we consider illegal -- with the affair in Salisbury to be categorically unacceptable , ” Peskov told reporters during his daily telephone briefing .
Russia has repeatedly denied any connection to the poisonings and has rejected British and European demands that it provide access to its chemical weapons arsenals , which Moscow insists it has destroyed .
Peskov said the U.S. had yet to inform Russia of the sanctions and so it would be incorrect to talk about countermeasures , though Russia ’ s embassy in Washington wrote in a statement the State Department had contacted officials .
Russia is already under a raft of sanctions from the U.S. and the European Union , imposed over its invasion of Ukraine and its interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election .
The Trump administration has also already responded to the nerve agent poisonings . In March 60 Russian diplomats were expelled and Russia 's consulate in Seattle was closed . The administration said then it believed Russia was responsible for the chemical attack .
The timing of the decision to now find Moscow in violation of the sanctions-inflicting law , five months later , has therefore been seen as significant by some , coming at a moment when President Trump is under pressure to appear tough on Russia over election meddling .
The sanctions announcement coincided with reports that the White House is drafting its own executive order that would sanction foreigners involved in election interference . The Washington Post reported that the 10-page order would give the president the authority to impose sanctions on “ 10 of the 30 largest business entities ” in a country whose government has interfered in an election . It would also impose mandatory sanctions on individuals found to have taken part in the interference .
Some former officials told The Post , however , that the order seemed more like a “ a cover-your-behind exercise ” for the administration than intended to seriously deter foreign powers . The Post concluded it is likely an attempt to stave off far more punitive sanctions legislation currently being considered in Congress .
Last week , a group of Democrat and Republican senators introduced a bill that would impose some of the toughest sanctions ever placed on modern Russia . Among other measures , it would put sanctions on any transactions related to Russian energy projects and new Russian sovereign debt , as well ban American individuals and businesses from working with Russian oil projects .
Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-S.C. , told reporters he wanted it to be a “ sanctions bill from hell. ” Russian stocks slumped following its unveiling and the dollar hit a two-year high against the rouble .
It remains unclear if lawmakers will succeed in passing the bill , with Congressional leaders having seemed unconvinced .
Trump 's administration 's new sanctions though throw off his recent attempts at outreach to the Kremlin that was on display at his meeting with President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki last month . Just this week , Republican Sen. Rand Paul -- who has been one of Trump ’ s few defenders over the Helsinki summit delivered a letter to Putin from Trump that he said emphasized a desire for greater cooperation in counterterrorism and cultural exchanges .
Peskov on Thursday appeared to extend an olive branch again to Trump , saying that Russia still hopes for “ constructive relations ” with the U.S .
“ Without question , ” Peskov said . “ President Putin spoke about this at the press conference in Helsinki . He maintains the hope for working out constructive relations with Washington . ”","The Kremlin has condemned as “unacceptable” new sanctions imposed by the Trump administration on Russia over Moscow's alleged involvement in the poisoning of a former Russian double agent.

“If proven some of this would be impeachable yes. Obstruction of justice, if proven, would be impeachable,” Nadler said. “We’re going to see where the facts lead us.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has insisted on a methodical, step-by-step approach to the House's oversight of the Trump administration, and she refuses to consider impeachment without public support, including from Republicans, which seems unlikely.

Speaking Friday in Belfast as Pelosi wrapped up a congressional visit to Ireland, she declined to signal action beyond Congress' role as a check and balance for the White House.

""Let me assure you that whatever the issue and challenge we face, the Congress of the United States will honor its oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States to protect our democracy,"" she told reporters. ""We believe that the first article — Article 1, the legislative branch — has the responsibility of oversight of our democracy, and we will exercise that.""

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – Paul Manafort, the former chairman of President Donald Trump's campaign, pleaded guilty Friday to two felony conspiracy charges and reached an agreement to provide ""complete cooperation"" with special counsel Robert Mueller's probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Manafort's plea deal brings investigators further into the president's inner circle of advisers and adds another conviction to their growing scorecard.

Wearing a dark suit, white shirt and purple tie, Manafort told U.S. District Judge Amy Jackson: ""I plead guilty.""

The 69-year-old former lobbyist and political operative acknowledged leading a long-running conspiracy involving his work on behalf of a pro-Russian faction in Ukraine led by the country's former president Viktor Yanukovych. He also pleaded guilty to obstructing the special counsel investigation he has now promised to assist.

The charges could send him to prison for more than a decade and will force him to surrender millions of dollars in bank accounts and real prime real estate, including a $3 million apartment in the president's namesake Trump Tower on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue.

Manafort's plea agreement makes him the latest Trump aide to cooperate with the investigation that has cast a shadow over the first two years of his presidency. And it suggests that investigators, who have now brought charges against four aides who served Trump on the campaign trail or in the White House, still have other targets in their sights.

Trump unconcerned, aides say

As recently as last month, Trump praised his former campaign manager, who he said said was a ""brave man"" who ""refused to break."" On Friday morning, however, that refusal came to an abrupt end. One of the prosecutors, Andrew Weissman, confirmed in court that Manafort was cooperating with the government's investigation.

Asked whether Manafort’s deal included an agreement to provide information related to President Trump, defense attorney Richard Westling said his client has pledged “complete cooperation.”

The agreement also is memorialized in court documents, requiring Manafort to cooperate with the government ""in any and all matters as to which the government deems...relevant.""

The implications of that agreement – including what investigators hope he will tell them, and about whom – were unclear. But Trump's advisers swiftly signaled that they were unconcerned.

""Once again an investigation has concluded with a plea having nothing to do with President Trump or the Trump campaign,"" Trump's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, said Friday. ""The reason: the President did nothing wrong.""

White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Manafort's case ""had absolutely nothing to do with the president or his victorious 2016 presidential campaign.""

""It is totally unrelated,"" Sanders said.

For months, Manafort had resisted taking the step he did on Friday, even as prosecutors piled on new felony charges and a jury in Virginia found him guilty of eight felonies. A separate trial on additional charges was due to start Monday in federal court in Washington.

Manafort's plea deal follows agreements that Mueller's team had already reached with Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn and Manafort's former deputy Rick Gates. Separately, Trump's former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, implicated him in a criminal campaign finance violation during his own plea hearing in federal court last month.

Manafort pleaded guilty Friday to conspiring against the United States for his work as an unregistered agent of Yanukovych's pro-Kremlin political faction in Ukraine, and of conspiring to obstruct justice by seeking to persuade two people who had helped with that work to offer inaccurate accounts to federal investigators.

Smear campaign in Ukraine

A sweeping 24-page statement of offenses cataloged a decade worth of criminal conduct, much of it centered on his work on behalf of the former Ukranian president, Yanukovych, now living in exile in Russia. Manafort, according to court documents, led a hardball political campaign in which he sought to smear Yanukovych's political rival, fromer Ukraine prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, as a murderer and anti-Semite.

Manafort and his partners earned tens of millions of dollars for that work between 2006 and 2015, and stashed large portions of it in Cyprus bank accounts to shield it from U.S. tax authorities.

Prosecutors asserted that Manafort ""knowingly"" filed false income tax returns between 2006 and 2015, and failed to report more than $15 million in income between 2010 and 2014.

The charges replace a raft of separate accusations that Manafort had failed to register as a foreign agent, lied to the government, laundered money and committed fraud. In a court filing Friday, Mueller's office said Manafort laundered more than $30 million from his work for Yanukovych, then ""used his hidden overseas wealth to enjoy a lavish lifestyle in the United States."" The criminal conduct continued through 2017.

Assortment of allegations

As Manafort's plea hearing began, Weissman walked methodically through the assortment of allegations in a packed federal courtroom in Washington. When he finished, the judge asked Manafort whether it was all true, describing the allegations as one of the ""longest"" such recitations in her court.

""It is,"" he replied in a soft voice.

In addition to the criminal charges, prosecutors said in a court filing that Manafort could be forced to forfeit assets that would deal him a significant financial blow: four houses he owns, including an expansive retreat in the Hamptons, plus bank accounts and the proceeds of a life insurance policy.

Manafort’s lead attorney, Kevin Downing, said after Friday’s hearing that his client “accepted responsibility” and wanted to “make sure his family would remain safe and live a good life.”

Downing said that Manafort is committed to his cooperation agreement with the government, adding that a schedule of meetings already has been set.

The indictment , which alleges a wide-ranging conspiracy involving sophisticated hacking and staged releases of documents , raises the stakes for a summit next week between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin .
Officers of Russia ’ s military intelligence agency , the GRU , covertly monitored computers of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton ’ s campaign and Democratic campaign committees , and stole large amounts of data , the indictment said .
“ In addition to releasing documents directly to the public , the defendants transferred stolen documents to another organization , not named in the indictment , and discussed timing the release of the documents in an attempt to enhance the impact on the election , ” Deputy U.S. Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told a news conference .
Friday ’ s indictment was secured by Special Counsel Robert Mueller as part of his probe into Russian involvement in the election . It was the first by Mueller that directly charges the Russian government with meddling in the election , which Trump unexpectedly won . The Kremlin denies it interfered .
Rosenstein said he briefed Trump this week about the indictment . It contains no allegations that U.S. citizens committed a crime , he said .
A few hours before the indictments were announced , Trump called the Mueller investigation a “ rigged witch hunt ” that is hurting the United States ’ relationship with Russia .
The announcement of the indictment came at an awkward time for Trump , who met Britain ’ s Queen Elizabeth at Windsor Castle on Friday for tea during a visit to Britain .
Trump said he would “ absolutely , firmly ask ” Putin about the meddling at their planned meeting in Helsinki on Monday .
The Russian Foreign Ministry said on Friday that the indictment aimed to damage the atmosphere before the summit . It said there was no evidence that the 12 people charged were linked to military intelligence or hacking .
Several prominent Democratic lawmakers called on Trump to cancel the summit .
“ In light of this stunning indictment by the Justice Department that these Russian conspirators attacked our democracy and were communicating with Americans to interfere in our election , President Trump should immediately cancel his meeting with Vladimir Putin , ” said Senator Jack Reed , the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee .
Mueller is investigating whether Trump ’ s campaign colluded with Russia and whether the president has unlawfully sought to obstruct the Russia investigation .
U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in January 2017 that Russia , in action ordered by Putin , used propaganda and hacking to meddle in the election to harm Clinton and eventually help Trump .
But the 29-page document describes several incidents in which the alleged Russian hackers , using the internet personas DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0 , were in contact with Americans .
It says Russian operatives provided direct assistance to a candidate for the U.S. Congress , who in August 2016 requested and received from Guccifer 2.0 documents stolen from the DCCC about their opponent . The candidate and the person ’ s party affiliation were not identified .
That same month , the indictment says , “ the Conspirators , posing as Guccifer 2.0 , sent a reporter stolen documents pertaining to the Black Lives Matter movement , ” which was a sensitive political issue for the Democratic Party .
The reporter , who was not identified , “ responded by discussing when to release the documents and offering to write an article about their release . ”
The indictment says the Russian operatives wrote to a unnamed person “ who was in regular contact with senior members ” of the Trump campaign . Trump ally Roger Stone told CNN he “ probably ” was the person referred to in the indictment .
The indictment says the Russian operatives told the person it would be a “ great pleasure ” to help them and later asked their opinion about a stolen DCCC document posted online . “ ( P ) retty standard , ” the person responded .
Stone denied passing any stolen emails to WikiLeaks . He said in a statement to ███ : “ The indictments today show I did not conspire with any of the defendants to do the hacking , distribute the stolen emails or aid them in anyway . ”
Deputy U.S. Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announces grand jury indictments of 12 Russian intelligence officers in special counsel Robert Mueller 's Russia investigation during a news conference at the Justice Department in Washington , U.S. , July 13 , 2018 . ███/Leah Millis
A former federal prosecutor , Renato Mariotti , raised the question of the next steps in the probe .
“ The open question is whether Americans were involved in this and will they be charged . You can certainly imagine a subsequent indictment in the future of an American of being part of this conspiracy , ” Mariotti said .
The indictment says that on or about July 27 , 2016 , the Russians attempted for the first time to break into email accounts “ at a domain hosted by a third-party provider and used by Clinton ’ s personal office . At or around the same time , they also targeted 76 email addresses at the domain of the Clinton Campaign . ”
The same day , candidate Trump told a news conference : “ Russia if you are listening I hope you ’ re able to find the 30,000 ( Clinton ) emails that are missing , ” referring to emails from a private server used by Clinton when she was secretary of state .
The indictment documents extensive cooperation between the Russian hackers and the unnamed “ Organization 1 . ”
That group appears to match WikiLeaks , which released large numbers of hacked Democratic Party emails during the 2016 campaign .
On July 22 , 2016 , Organization 1 “ released over 20,000 emails and other documents stolen from the DNC network by the Conspirators , ” the indictment said . That matches the date that a WikiLeaks began publishing internal DNC documents .
WikiLeaks , which was not indicted , did not immediately respond to a request for comment .

The indictment, which alleges a wide-ranging conspiracy involving sophisticated hacking and staged releases of documents, raises the stakes for a summit next week between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Officers of Russia’s military intelligence agency, the GRU, covertly monitored computers of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign and Democratic campaign committees, and stole large amounts of data, the indictment said.

“In addition to releasing documents directly to the public, the defendants transferred stolen documents to another organization, not named in the indictment, and discussed timing the release of the documents in an attempt to enhance the impact on the election,” Deputy U.S. Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told a news conference.

Friday’s indictment was secured by Special Counsel Robert Mueller as part of his probe into Russian involvement in the election. It was the first by Mueller that directly charges the Russian government with meddling in the election, which Trump unexpectedly won. The Kremlin denies it interfered.

Rosenstein said he briefed Trump this week about the indictment. It contains no allegations that U.S. citizens committed a crime, he said.

A few hours before the indictments were announced, Trump called the Mueller investigation a “rigged witch hunt” that is hurting the United States’ relationship with Russia.

The announcement of the indictment came at an awkward time for Trump, who met Britain’s Queen Elizabeth at Windsor Castle on Friday for tea during a visit to Britain.

Trump said he would “absolutely, firmly ask” Putin about the meddling at their planned meeting in Helsinki on Monday.

The Russian Foreign Ministry said on Friday that the indictment aimed to damage the atmosphere before the summit. It said there was no evidence that the 12 people charged were linked to military intelligence or hacking.

Several prominent Democratic lawmakers called on Trump to cancel the summit.

“In light of this stunning indictment by the Justice Department that these Russian conspirators attacked our democracy and were communicating with Americans to interfere in our election, President Trump should immediately cancel his meeting with Vladimir Putin,” said Senator Jack Reed, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee.

PROPAGANDA, HACKING

Mueller is investigating whether Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia and whether the president has unlawfully sought to obstruct the Russia investigation.

U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in January 2017 that Russia, in action ordered by Putin, used propaganda and hacking to meddle in the election to harm Clinton and eventually help Trump.

But the 29-page document describes several incidents in which the alleged Russian hackers, using the internet personas DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0, were in contact with Americans.

It says Russian operatives provided direct assistance to a candidate for the U.S. Congress, who in August 2016 requested and received from Guccifer 2.0 documents stolen from the DCCC about their opponent. The candidate and the person’s party affiliation were not identified.

That same month, the indictment says, “the Conspirators, posing as Guccifer 2.0, sent a reporter stolen documents pertaining to the Black Lives Matter movement,” which was a sensitive political issue for the Democratic Party.

The reporter, who was not identified, “responded by discussing when to release the documents and offering to write an article about their release.”

The indictment says the Russian operatives wrote to a unnamed person “who was in regular contact with senior members” of the Trump campaign. Trump ally Roger Stone told CNN he “probably” was the person referred to in the indictment.

The indictment says the Russian operatives told the person it would be a “great pleasure” to help them and later asked their opinion about a stolen DCCC document posted online. “(P)retty standard,” the person responded.

Stone denied passing any stolen emails to WikiLeaks. He said in a statement to Reuters: “The indictments today show I did not conspire with any of the defendants to do the hacking, distribute the stolen emails or aid them in anyway.”

“RUSSIANS ARE NAILED”

A former federal prosecutor, Renato Mariotti, raised the question of the next steps in the probe.

“The open question is whether Americans were involved in this and will they be charged. You can certainly imagine a subsequent indictment in the future of an American of being part of this conspiracy,” Mariotti said.

The indictment says that on or about July 27, 2016, the Russians attempted for the first time to break into email accounts “at a domain hosted by a third-party provider and used by Clinton’s personal office. At or around the same time, they also targeted 76 email addresses at the domain of the Clinton Campaign.”

The same day, candidate Trump told a news conference: “Russia if you are listening I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 (Clinton) emails that are missing,” referring to emails from a private server used by Clinton when she was secretary of state.

The indictment documents extensive cooperation between the Russian hackers and the unnamed “Organization 1.”

That group appears to match WikiLeaks, which released large numbers of hacked Democratic Party emails during the 2016 campaign.

On July 22, 2016, Organization 1 “released over 20,000 emails and other documents stolen from the DNC network by the Conspirators,” the indictment said. That matches the date that a WikiLeaks began publishing internal DNC documents.

WikiLeaks, which was not indicted, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In June 2016, “Organization 1 sent a private message to Guccifer 2.0 to ‘(s)end any new material (stolen from the DNC) here for us to review and it will have a much higher impact than what you are doing,” the indictment said.

Trump lawyer Rudolph Giuliani, in a tweet, said the indictments showed it was time to end the special counsel’s probe.

“The indictments Rod Rosenstein announced are good news for all Americans. The Russians are nailed. No Americans are involved. Time for Mueller to end this pursuit of the President and say President Trump is completely innocent,” Giuliani said.

Attorney General William Barr's refusal to appear before the House Judiciary Committee did accomplish one thing, according to Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md.

""They have succeeded in building a near unanimous sense in the Democratic Caucus that the executive branch of government is in defiance of the Constitution and the rule of law,"" said Raskin, a former constitutional law professor who sits on both the House Judiciary and Oversight committees.

Barr, already under steady attack from Democrats in both the House and Senate, declined to appear Thursday before the House Judiciary Committee because he did not want to be questioned by committee lawyers, only members. Democrats refused to accommodate Barr because Raskin said there's a bigger constitutional principle at stake. ""He doesn't dictate to us how we conduct hearings in Congress,"" he said.

The Trump administration has made clear they're not going to play nice with Democrats' demands. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler requesting staff lawyers question the attorney general was a ""pathetic"" moment for the committee. ""Look, we lost confidence in Jerry Nadler a long time ago, but it's surprising to find out he's lost confidence in himself,"" Sanders said.

Democrats say they are considering all options. Pockets of Democrats are already calling for Barr's impeachment, including Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., who is running for president. Others, including many of the 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls, have called on him to resign.

There's talk of censure, a type of public reprimand that has little practical effect.

russia,CBS News,0,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/house-intelligence-committee-transcripts-provide-new-insight-fuel-old-divisions/,"House Intelligence Committee transcripts provide new insight, fuel old divisions",,Olivia Gazis,"Thousands of pages of witness transcripts released Thursday by the House Intelligence Committee provided immediate , if timeworn , fodder for unhealed partisan divisions stemming from the panel 's investigation into Russia 's 2016 election interference .
They did little to dislodge headlines related to the rising health and economic toll of the coronavirus pandemic , though President Trump seized on the transcripts ' release in a morning phone interview with Fox News . He resurfaced criticisms of former Obama administration officials and allies-turned-nemeses like Jeff Sessions , who served as the Trump administration 's first attorney general . Mr. Trump also foreshadowed more developments that he suggested would involve presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden .
`` There 's more to come from what I understand , and they 're going to be far greater than what you 've seen so far , '' Mr. Trump said .
The committee transcripts mostly retread territory made familiar by the findings of special counsel Robert Mueller , whose two-year investigation into Russia 's 2016 election interference and potential links between Moscow and the Trump campaign became regarded as the seminal probe of the matter , even as two congressional committees conducted parallel inquiries .
The transcripts , 57 in total , include testimony from a spectrum of witnesses , including former Clinton campaign chair John Podesta , Obama administration officials Susan Rice , Susan Power and James Clapper , Trump campaign officials Brad Parscale and Jared Kushner , and ancillary figures like Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix and Simona Mangiante Papadopoulos .
They include candid details from former Trump administration officials like Mr . Sessions and former Director of National Intelligence ( DNI ) Dan Coats . And they reveal the increasing levels of acrimony among the panel 's Republicans and Democrats – while earlier transcripts reflect occasional camaraderie and include open-ended questioning , by December 2017 battle lines were hardened and sniping and gamesmanship were more frequent .
By early 2018 , some interviews – like those with former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon and the committee 's final interview with Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski – broke down into profanity-laced confrontations over executive privilege and contempt proceedings .
Below are excerpts of particularly candid or lesser-known exchanges , culled from over 6,000 pages by a ███ team .
Several former Trump campaign aides were asked about their conversations with the president about Russia-related topics . Most acknowledged Mr. Trump 's preoccupation with the press linking his campaign to Moscow , though some made light of it .
`` I believe , because Russia was part of — and I am speculating — but I believe because Russia was part of the Hillary Clinton campaign 's attack on then-candidate Trump , that he just planted his feet and said , 'No , no , ' said Michael Caputo , a former campaign official who has recently joined the administration as a spokesman the Department of Health and Human Services . `` I believe that if Hillary Clinton had said the sky is blue , he would have said no . ''
`` I do n't think that was advisable , '' Caputo continued . `` I think now we know that it was — it made all of this worse . But when the then-candidate , when the president of the United States takes a position in that office , you follow or you leave , '' he said .
Sam Clovis , the former national co-chair for the Trump campaign , said , `` I think he was having a lot of fun with the Putin thing . ''
`` Did he ever express definitive or indefinitive favorable positions about Russia in your presence ? '' asked Democratic Congressman Eric Swalwell in an interview in December of 2017 .
`` No , I think just to pimp the media on Putin , '' Clovis responded .
Coats , the former DNI , was among the earliest witnesses to appear before the committee , in June of 2017 . He said the president 's focus on press coverage proved at times to be a distraction .
`` [ H ] e was being targeted by the media , and there was some venting , which at times made me a little bit frustrated , '' Coats said . `` I thought it was taking away from getting him the intelligence that he needed relative to making decisions and so forth . ''
Asked if the president ever asked him to speak out publicly in his defense , Coats said he told the president he did n't think it would be `` appropriate '' for him to do so .
`` 'Mr . President , in my job , that is nothing I think — I do n't think it is appropriate for me to do that , ' '' Coats said he told Mr. Trump , who had called the DNI at home the night of the semifinals of the Final Four .
`` I guess he was thinking : 'Look , you are the Director of DNl . ' He was probably in his mind thinking : 'Hey , you are — if anybody knows what is going on in intelligence , from an intelligence standpoint , you must be , you say it , ' '' Coats said . `` I did not think it was appropriate to do that . ''
`` To tell you the truth , '' he continued , `` I was sitting there thinking : Here is the President of the United States sitting in an empty White House . His wife is in New York . His family is in New York . On a Saturday night , that has got to be a lonely thing to do . ''
Coats also told congressional investigators that then-FBI Director James Comey told him there was `` smoke but no fire '' on the question of whether evidence of a conspiracy – which often was referred to as 'collusion , ' a looser , non-legal term – existed .
`` There is smoke but no fire on the issue of collusion … He did n't use the word 'collusion , ' '' Coats said . `` He said : 'Right now , I am only targeting — we are only looking at one person who had some role in the campaign . He said that person is Carter Page , but he said there is — there is no evidence to indicate at this point that the President had collusion with the Russians , '' he said .
Coats himself denied having any knowledge of `` evidence of collusion , coordination or conspiracy '' between Russia and Donald Trump or members of his campaign – a blanket question commonly asked of witnesses by Republicans on the committee .
`` I never saw any direct empirical evidence that the Trump campaign or someone in it was plotting , conspiring with the Russians to meddle with the election , '' former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper testified . `` That 's not to say there were n't concerns about the evidence we were seeing , anecdotal evidence . ''
`` I saw indications of potential coordination , '' said Ben Rhodes , former deputy national security adviser to President Obama , `` but I did not see , you know , the specific evidence of the actions of the Trump campaign . ''
`` I think that 's why these investigations have to get to the bottom of it , '' he said .
A number of witnesses were asked about the contents of the so-called Steele dossier , a document of raw , unverified intelligence compiled by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele , who had previously worked with the FBI . It contained a number of salacious details about the president , and caused shock waves after it was leaked to the media in 2017 .
After reading one of the most controversial allegations in the dossier , Representative Trey Gowdy asked Keith Schiller , who worked for years as Mr. Trump 's bodyguard and had accompanied him on a trip to Russia , where the alleged actions were to have taken place , if he had `` anything to corroborate that salacious allegation in the dossier . ''
He later testified that , while traveling in Russia , `` someone '' suggested sending women to Mr. Trump 's hotel room .
`` I believe he was joking , because I immediately told him , 'Absolutely not . We do n't do that . But I do n't know who it was . '' Schiller said when he later told Mr. Trump about the suggestion , `` He laughed . ''
`` We both laughed , '' Schiller testified . `` I told him it was immediately something that we would never do , and I just told him I shut it down immediately . ''
Coats also described one conversation he had with the president about the dossier 's salacious contents .
`` I do n't know why he said this to me . Maybe because it is my background , my faith background , or whatever , I do n't know , '' Coats said . `` He said : ' I want to — I swear to you on the soul of my son , I had nothing to do with that prostitution . And for them to take me aside and raise that issue and then have it leaked , he said , how would you like it if — how do you go home and talk to your wife when it is plastered all over the place that you were using prostitutes in Russia , and you are having your family hear that and having your son hear that ? ' ''
In an exchange that is lightly redacted , Mr. Clapper was asked whether the intelligence community attempted to validate any of the sources , subsources or contents of the dossier , which was included in an annex to the 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment of Russia 's 2016 interference .
`` Yeah , '' Clapper said of including the document as an annex , `` And the reason we handled it that way was precisely because we could not corroborate [ REDACTED ] . ''
After another partially redacted exchange , he continued , `` The Intelligence Community at large did n't take that on . That would be a responsibility of , if anyone , would be the FBI . ''
Clapper also described some of his own interactions with former national security adviser Michael Flynn , who briefly served as president Trump 's national security adviser before resigning after information emerged that he had lied to the FBI and Vice President Mike Pence about his communications with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak . The Department of Justice dropped its charges against Flynn on the same day the committee 's transcripts were released .
`` I do think the Russians , even during the time he served as director of [ the Defense Intelligence Agency ] , were wooing him , '' Clapper testified . `` I was wooed by the Russians when I was director of DIA in the early nineties . ''
`` [ H ] e was very big on engaging with the GRU , '' an arm of Russia 's military intelligence , Clapper said . `` He visited there and had the GRU chief visit him . I did the same thing , '' he said . `` And I tried to impart some fatherly advice to Mike Flynn when he was engaging with them , because I said , you know , my own experience when I was the director of DIA . ''
Jared Kushner , who worked on the Trump campaign and transition team before becoming a senior White House adviser , described his conversations with Kislyak and Flynn during a December 1 , 2016 meeting . Kushner said Kislyak wanted to discuss the U.S. position on Syria .
`` We did not have a fully formed view on what we wanted to do in Syria , '' Kushner said . `` So , in order to collect different opinions , so that we can try to come up with a strategy to present to the President at some point in time , they offered to have their generals give their perspective to General Flynn . That 's when he said : 'Look , I would like you to hear their side of what they think ' … They asked if we had a secure way to do that , to which General Flynn said no . ''
After agreeing the generals were unlikely to come in person to the U.S. , Kushner said , `` I 'm a business guy . I said : `` Look , if you want to give us information , if you have a way to get information , then let us just use the way you get the information . ' ''
`` And [ Kislyak ] says : 'Well , we should n't do that in our Embassy . '
Susan Rice , Flynn 's functional predecessor in the Obama administration , testified that when she read the press reports about the communications between Kushner , Flynn and Kislyak , `` I was horrified . ''
`` It 's inconceivable to me that someone associated with an incoming administration would seek to have a private channel with an adversarial government designed to be hidden from the government that he or she was going to represent in a few weeks ' time , '' she said .
`` That approach , if it 's true , would suggest to me that one places more confidence in our principal adversary 's interests and communications than they do in our own , '' she said . `` And it is deeply troubling to me that anybody responsible in any way , shape , or form for U.S. policy would privilege the Russians over the United States Government .

They did little to dislodge headlines related to the rising health and economic toll of the coronavirus pandemic, though President Trump seized on the transcripts' release in a morning phone interview with Fox News. He resurfaced criticisms of former Obama administration officials and allies-turned-nemeses like Jeff Sessions, who served as the Trump administration's first attorney general. Mr. Trump also foreshadowed more developments that he suggested would involve presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.

""There's more to come from what I understand, and they're going to be far greater than what you've seen so far,"" Mr. Trump said.

The committee transcripts mostly retread territory made familiar by the findings of special counsel Robert Mueller, whose two-year investigation into Russia's 2016 election interference and potential links between Moscow and the Trump campaign became regarded as the seminal probe of the matter, even as two congressional committees conducted parallel inquiries.

The transcripts, 57 in total, include testimony from a spectrum of witnesses, including former Clinton campaign chair John Podesta, Obama administration officials Susan Rice, Susan Power and James Clapper, Trump campaign officials Brad Parscale and Jared Kushner, and ancillary figures like Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix and Simona Mangiante Papadopoulos.

They include candid details from former Trump administration officials like Mr. Sessions and former Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Dan Coats. And they reveal the increasing levels of acrimony among the panel's Republicans and Democrats – while earlier transcripts reflect occasional camaraderie and include open-ended questioning, by December 2017 battle lines were hardened and sniping and gamesmanship were more frequent.

By early 2018, some interviews – like those with former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon and the committee's final interview with Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski – broke down into profanity-laced confrontations over executive privilege and contempt proceedings.

Below are excerpts of particularly candid or lesser-known exchanges, culled from over 6,000 pages by a CBS News team.

TRUMP AND RUSSIA

Several former Trump campaign aides were asked about their conversations with the president about Russia-related topics. Most acknowledged Mr. Trump's preoccupation with the press linking his campaign to Moscow, though some made light of it.

""I believe, because Russia was part of — and I am speculating — but I believe because Russia was part of the Hillary Clinton campaign's attack on then-candidate Trump, that he just planted his feet and said, 'No, no,' said Michael Caputo, a former campaign official who has recently joined the administration as a spokesman the Department of Health and Human Services. ""I believe that if Hillary Clinton had said the sky is blue, he would have said no.""

""I don't think that was advisable,"" Caputo continued. ""I think now we know that it was — it made all of this worse. But when the then-candidate, when the president of the United States takes a position in that office, you follow or you leave,"" he said.

Sam Clovis, the former national co-chair for the Trump campaign, said, ""I think he was having a lot of fun with the Putin thing.""

""Did he ever express definitive or indefinitive favorable positions about Russia in your presence?"" asked Democratic Congressman Eric Swalwell in an interview in December of 2017.

""No, I think just to pimp the media on Putin,"" Clovis responded.

Coats, the former DNI, was among the earliest witnesses to appear before the committee, in June of 2017. He said the president's focus on press coverage proved at times to be a distraction.

""[H]e was being targeted by the media, and there was some venting, which at times made me a little bit frustrated,"" Coats said. ""I thought it was taking away from getting him the intelligence that he needed relative to making decisions and so forth.""

Asked if the president ever asked him to speak out publicly in his defense, Coats said he told the president he didn't think it would be ""appropriate"" for him to do so.

""'Mr. President, in my job, that is nothing I think — I don't think it is appropriate for me to do that,'"" Coats said he told Mr. Trump, who had called the DNI at home the night of the semifinals of the Final Four.

""I guess he was thinking: 'Look, you are the Director of DNl.' He was probably in his mind thinking: 'Hey, you are — if anybody knows what is going on in intelligence, from an intelligence standpoint, you must be, you say it,'"" Coats said. ""I did not think it was appropriate to do that.""

""To tell you the truth,"" he continued, ""I was sitting there thinking: Here is the President of the United States sitting in an empty White House. His wife is in New York. His family is in New York. On a Saturday night, that has got to be a lonely thing to do.""

THE QUESTION OF COLLUSION

Coats also told congressional investigators that then-FBI Director James Comey told him there was ""smoke but no fire"" on the question of whether evidence of a conspiracy – which often was referred to as 'collusion,' a looser, non-legal term – existed.

""There is smoke but no fire on the issue of collusion … He didn't use the word 'collusion,'"" Coats said. ""He said: 'Right now, I am only targeting — we are only looking at one person who had some role in the campaign. He said that person is Carter Page, but he said there is — there is no evidence to indicate at this point that the President had collusion with the Russians,"" he said.

Coats himself denied having any knowledge of ""evidence of collusion, coordination or conspiracy"" between Russia and Donald Trump or members of his campaign – a blanket question commonly asked of witnesses by Republicans on the committee.

""I never saw any direct empirical evidence that the Trump campaign or someone in it was plotting, conspiring with the Russians to meddle with the election,"" former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper testified. ""That's not to say there weren't concerns about the evidence we were seeing, anecdotal evidence.""

""I saw indications of potential coordination,"" said Ben Rhodes, former deputy national security adviser to President Obama, ""but I did not see, you know, the specific evidence of the actions of the Trump campaign.""

""I think that's why these investigations have to get to the bottom of it,"" he said.

THE STEELE DOSSIER

A number of witnesses were asked about the contents of the so-called Steele dossier, a document of raw, unverified intelligence compiled by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, who had previously worked with the FBI. It contained a number of salacious details about the president, and caused shock waves after it was leaked to the media in 2017.

After reading one of the most controversial allegations in the dossier, Representative Trey Gowdy asked Keith Schiller, who worked for years as Mr. Trump's bodyguard and had accompanied him on a trip to Russia, where the alleged actions were to have taken place, if he had ""anything to corroborate that salacious allegation in the dossier.""

""No sir, I don't,"" Mr. Schiller responded.

He later testified that, while traveling in Russia, ""someone"" suggested sending women to Mr. Trump's hotel room.

""I believe he was joking, because I immediately told him, 'Absolutely not. We don't do that. But I don't know who it was."" Schiller said when he later told Mr. Trump about the suggestion, ""He laughed.""

""We both laughed,"" Schiller testified. ""I told him it was immediately something that we would never do, and I just told him I shut it down immediately.""

Coats also described one conversation he had with the president about the dossier's salacious contents.

""I don't know why he said this to me. Maybe because it is my background, my faith background, or whatever, I don't know,"" Coats said. ""He said: 'I want to — I swear to you on the soul of my son, I had nothing to do with that prostitution. And for them to take me aside and raise that issue and then have it leaked, he said, how would you like it if — how do you go home and talk to your wife when it is plastered all over the place that you were using prostitutes in Russia, and you are having your family hear that and having your son hear that?'""

""H was just really, really impacted,"" Coats said.

In an exchange that is lightly redacted, Mr. Clapper was asked whether the intelligence community attempted to validate any of the sources, subsources or contents of the dossier, which was included in an annex to the 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment of Russia's 2016 interference.

""Yeah,"" Clapper said of including the document as an annex, ""And the reason we handled it that way was precisely because we could not corroborate [REDACTED].""

After another partially redacted exchange, he continued, ""The Intelligence Community at large didn't take that on. That would be a responsibility of, if anyone, would be the FBI.""

MICHAEL FLYNN, FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER

Clapper also described some of his own interactions with former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who briefly served as president Trump's national security adviser before resigning after information emerged that he had lied to the FBI and Vice President Mike Pence about his communications with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. The Department of Justice dropped its charges against Flynn on the same day the committee's transcripts were released.

""I do think the Russians, even during the time he served as director of [the Defense Intelligence Agency], were wooing him,"" Clapper testified. ""I was wooed by the Russians when I was director of DIA in the early nineties.""

""[H]e was very big on engaging with the GRU,"" an arm of Russia's military intelligence, Clapper said. ""He visited there and had the GRU chief visit him. I did the same thing,"" he said. ""And I tried to impart some fatherly advice to Mike Flynn when he was engaging with them, because I said, you know, my own experience when I was the director of DIA.""

Jared Kushner, who worked on the Trump campaign and transition team before becoming a senior White House adviser, described his conversations with Kislyak and Flynn during a December 1, 2016 meeting. Kushner said Kislyak wanted to discuss the U.S. position on Syria.

""We did not have a fully formed view on what we wanted to do in Syria,"" Kushner said. ""So, in order to collect different opinions, so that we can try to come up with a strategy to present to the President at some point in time, they offered to have their generals give their perspective to General Flynn. That's when he said: 'Look, I would like you to hear their side of what they think' … They asked if we had a secure way to do that, to which General Flynn said no.""

After agreeing the generals were unlikely to come in person to the U.S., Kushner said, ""I'm a business guy. I said: ""Look, if you want to give us information, if you have a way to get information, then let us just use the way you get the information.'""

""And [Kislyak] says: 'Well, we shouldn't do that in our Embassy.'

And we said: 'No problem.'""

Susan Rice, Flynn's functional predecessor in the Obama administration, testified that when she read the press reports about the communications between Kushner, Flynn and Kislyak, ""I was horrified.""

""It's inconceivable to me that someone associated with an incoming administration would seek to have a private channel with an adversarial government designed to be hidden from the government that he or she was going to represent in a few weeks' time,"" she said.

russia,Washington Times,2,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/jul/22/robert-menendez-rips-donald-trump-vladimir-putin-r/,Lawmakers wary of Trump's 'red-carpet treatment' for Putin,2018-07-22,Tom Howell Jr.,"American leaders must discuss matters with leaders of rival nations but they shouldn ’ t coddle them or give them lofty treatment , lawmakers in both parties said Sunday , responding to President Trump ’ s decision to invite Russian President Vladimir Putin to D.C. this fall .
Sen. Robert Menendez , New Jersey Democrat , said he ’ s worried the invitation rises to the level of “ red-carpet treatment ” for a leader accused of meddling in the U.S. election in 2016 .
“ To me , that ’ s beyond comprehension , ” Mr. Menendez told Fox News Sunday . “ You can speak to adversaries , but at the end of the day you have to do it in a way that challenges them . ”
Likewise , Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina said the U.S. “ sometimes has to meet with people who we don ’ t have anything in common with . ”
However , the Republican said the White House needs to be “ judicious ” in who it invites to the U.S. , saying the optics around the invitations send a signal to the rest of the world .
Mr. Trump ’ s decision to invite Mr. Putin appeared to catch his Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats off guard .
Mr. Coats , speaking at a security conference in Aspen , Colorado , didn ’ t know about the invitation until he was informed by the moderator on stage on Thursday .
When told again about the invitation , Mr. Coats replied , “ OK . That ’ s going to be special . ”

Mr. Trump walked it back the next day , though lawmakers in both parties say Mr. Trump missed a chance to confront the Russian leader .
Mr. Menendez said Fox News took a harder line on Mr. Putin in a one-on-one interview than the U.S. president had during his press conference in Helsinki .
“ I would have liked for him to do what your colleague , Chris Wallace , did in his interview , ” Mr. Menendez told Fox News Sunday guest host Bret Baier .","American leaders must discuss matters with leaders of rival nations but they shouldn’t coddle them or give them lofty treatment, lawmakers in both parties said Sunday, responding to President Trump’s decision to invite Russian President Vladimir Putin to D.C. this fall.

Sen. Robert Menendez, New Jersey Democrat, said he’s worried the invitation rises to the level of “red-carpet treatment” for a leader accused of meddling in the U.S. election in 2016.

“To me, that’s beyond comprehension,” Mr. Menendez told Fox News Sunday. “You can speak to adversaries, but at the end of the day you have to do it in a way that challenges them.”

Likewise, Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina said the U.S. “sometimes has to meet with people who we don’t have anything in common with.”

However, the Republican said the White House needs to be “judicious” in who it invites to the U.S., saying the optics around the invitations send a signal to the rest of the world.

Mr. Coats, speaking at a security conference in Aspen, Colorado, didn’t know about the invitation until he was informed by the moderator on stage on Thursday.

When told again about the invitation, Mr. Coats replied, “OK. That’s going to be special.”

The president clarified his remarks during a meeting with lawmakers at the White House , in a rare backtrack .
In Helsinki a day earlier , Trump had said he does n't `` see any reason why '' Russia would be behind election meddling . This and other comments led to bipartisan outrage and accusations that he was taking Putin 's word over the intelligence community 's .
But Trump said Tuesday he meant the opposite . He suggested he was surprised by the negative reaction when he returned to Washington .
`` I came back and said 'What is going on , what ’ s the big deal ? ' ” Trump said , adding that he reviewed the transcript and `` realized that there is a need for some clarification . ''
The president told reporters that he meant to say he does n't see why Russia `` would n't '' be responsible .
“ I said the word 'would ' instead of 'would n't ' ... sort of a double negative , '' he said .
It 's unclear whether the clarification will calm the backlash in Washington , as Trump also said following his meeting with Putin that the Russian leader gave a `` strong and powerful '' denial . Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer , D-N.Y. , kept up his criticism Tuesday afternoon , tweeting : `` President Trump tried to squirm away from what he said yesterday . It ’ s twenty-four hours too late , and in the wrong place . ''
But Trump sought to make clear Tuesday that he stands behind the intelligence community .
`` I accept our intelligence community 's conclusion that Russia ’ s meddling in the 2016 election took place , '' he said , adding : `` It could be other people also . ''
Trump 's comments came after even his allies urged him to clean up the press conference statements from Finland . Until now , Trump had battled his critics via Twitter while defending his trip abroad .
Trump tweeted earlier Tuesday that his earlier NATO meeting , where he pressed allies to commit more in defense spending , as well as the Putin summit were a success . Further , he argued his actions at NATO would be bad for Russia .
“ I had a great meeting with NATO . They have paid $ 33 Billion more and will pay hundreds of Billions of Dollars more in the future , only because of me . NATO was weak , but now it is strong again ( bad for Russia ) . The media only says I was rude to leaders , never mentions the money ! ” Trump tweeted on Tuesday .

Trump continued to defend the meetings themselves while speaking to lawmakers at the White House , touting them as a success .
`` We are going to have peace , that 's what we want , and that 's what we 're going to have . I say peace through strength , '' Trump said of his talks with NATO allies , noting that the talks brought a `` great spirit that we did n't have before . ''
Trump also defended his meeting with Putin , saying he entered with a strategy of `` diplomacy '' and `` engagement , '' which is `` better than hostility . ''
Trump said he was in a position of `` strength '' in the meeting .
`` Our economy is booming , and our military ... it will be more powerful of a military than we 've ever had before , '' Trump said , noting the range of topics he and Putin discussed included Syria , Iran , nuclear proliferation , North Korea and Israel .

Trump had angered members of both parties , though , by saying both countries are to blame for damaged U.S.-Russian relations , and letting Putin deny election meddling unchallenged .
House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer , D-Md. , said earlier Tuesday that Trump 's remarks were `` nothing short of treason , '' echoing comments from Obama CIA boss John Brennan . He brushed off pressure from the party ’ s left flank to pursue impeachment , calling the issue a “ distraction ” – but kept the door open for some kind of future rebuke , saying there will be time to address such issues “ once we take control of the House back . ”
“ Russia did meddle with our elections , ” House Speaker Paul Ryan , R-Wis. , told reporters on Capitol Hill Tuesday , while urging the U.S. to aid other democracies around the world in protecting their election systems . “ We know that they interfered , and we have passed sanctions…to make sure they don ’ t interfere again . ”
Ryan suggested that the U.S. “ will face this Russian aggression again . ”
When asked whether he thought Trump was treasonous , he responded : “ I do not . ”
Ryan did say , however , that Special Counsel Robert Mueller “ should be allowed to carry out his work ” in investigating Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates during the 2016 presidential election .

russia,Fox Online News,2,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hearing-for-acting-ag-whitaker-erupts-in-fireworks-as-top-republican-alleges-character-assassination,Hearing erupts as Acting AG Whitaker calls time on Dem chairman: ‘Your 5 minutes is up’,,Brooke Singman,"Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker stunned onlookers and lawmakers during an already-contentious House hearing Friday , when he tried to call time on the Democratic chairman after yet another line of questioning regarding Special Counsel Robert Mueller 's Russia probe .
The retort came after Chairman Jerrold Nadler , D-N.Y. , first said he wanted Whitaker to appear for a private deposition after the hearing and went on to ask Whitaker whether he had been “ asked to approve any requests or action ” for the special counsel .
WHITAKER WILL TESTIFY BEFORE HOUSE PANEL AFTER TENSE BACK-AND-FORTH : NADLER AND DOJ
“ Mr . Chairman , I see that your five minutes is up , so… ” Whitaker replied as the hearing room broke out in gasps . “ I am here voluntarily . We have agreed to five-minute rounds . ”
Nadler , who even cracked a slight smile at the response , repeated his question , and Whitaker ultimately responded : “ I have not interfered in any way with the special counsel ’ s investigation . ”
As it dragged on , the hearing repeatedly gave way to bickering among Whitaker and Democratic lawmakers , and among members of the committee , over whether Whitaker was properly answering questions . At one point , he tussled with Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee , D-Texas , when she pressed on whether he ’ s appeared before for an oversight hearing .
While the answer , eventually , was that he had not , the congresswoman objected when Whitaker would not answer with a requested “ yes or no. ” When she asked the chairman if her time had been restored , Whitaker snarked back : “ I don ’ t know whether your time ’ s been restored or not . ”
“ Mr . Attorney General , we ’ re not joking here , and your humor is not acceptable , ” the congresswoman responded .
The fiery back and forth follows a dramatic political prelude to the hearing itself , complete with threats by Nadler to subpoena the witness and threats by the DOJ to boycott . Democrats are acutely focused on Whitaker 's oversight of the Mueller probe , in his acting AG status while awaiting confirmation of President Trump 's attorney general pick William Barr .
“ There has been no change in the overall management of the special counsel investigation , ” Whitaker testified Friday , saying that he never offered any “ promises or commitments ” regarding the Mueller or any other investigation .
Nadler pressed Whitaker over whether he had shared information about the investigation with Trump , or any White House officials .
“ I do not intend today to talk about my private conversations , but to answer your question , I did not talk to the president about the status of the investigation , ” Whitaker answered . “ Consistent with what I ’ ve already said , I have not talked about the special counsel ’ s investigation with any White House officials . ”
Whitaker did not directly answer several of Nadler ’ s other questions , resulting in the chairman requesting that the acting attorney general return to the committee at a later date .
“ I ’ ve given you a fair opportunity so that we could avoid this fight in the first place , but you don ’ t appear to have done any of that , ” Nadler said , referring to Whitaker ’ s preparations , while saying , “ I do not believe issuing a subpoena here would correct the problem. ” Nadler explained that the committee would “ attempt to reach an accommodation with the department to receive answers , ” so Whitaker can return for “ deposition before the committee , under oath . ”
Nadler said that , at that point , he expects “ clean answers or proper assertion of privilege claimed by the president . ”
Meanwhile , the top Republican on the committee blasted the hearing as a `` dog and pony show . ''
“ This hearing is a character assassination on Acting Attorney General Whitaker , all pure political theater , to go after the president , ” Ranking Member Doug Collins , R-Ga , said in his opening statement while urging the committee to adjourn .
A vote was then taken on whether to abruptly end the hearing . The measure did not pass , and the hearing began as scheduled .

Whitaker , though , said he had been “ fully briefed ” on the probe .","Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker stunned onlookers and lawmakers during an already-contentious House hearing Friday, when he tried to call time on the Democratic chairman after yet another line of questioning regarding Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.

The retort came after Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., first said he wanted Whitaker to appear for a private deposition after the hearing and went on to ask Whitaker whether he had been “asked to approve any requests or action” for the special counsel.

WHITAKER WILL TESTIFY BEFORE HOUSE PANEL AFTER TENSE BACK-AND-FORTH: NADLER AND DOJ

“Mr. Chairman, I see that your five minutes is up, so…” Whitaker replied as the hearing room broke out in gasps. “I am here voluntarily. We have agreed to five-minute rounds.”

Nadler, who even cracked a slight smile at the response, repeated his question, and Whitaker ultimately responded: “I have not interfered in any way with the special counsel’s investigation.”

As it dragged on, the hearing repeatedly gave way to bickering among Whitaker and Democratic lawmakers, and among members of the committee, over whether Whitaker was properly answering questions. At one point, he tussled with Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, when she pressed on whether he’s appeared before for an oversight hearing.

While the answer, eventually, was that he had not, the congresswoman objected when Whitaker would not answer with a requested “yes or no.” When she asked the chairman if her time had been restored, Whitaker snarked back: “I don’t know whether your time’s been restored or not.”

“Mr. Attorney General, we’re not joking here, and your humor is not acceptable,” the congresswoman responded.

The fiery back and forth follows a dramatic political prelude to the hearing itself, complete with threats by Nadler to subpoena the witness and threats by the DOJ to boycott. Democrats are acutely focused on Whitaker's oversight of the Mueller probe, in his acting AG status while awaiting confirmation of President Trump's attorney general pick William Barr.

“There has been no change in the overall management of the special counsel investigation,” Whitaker testified Friday, saying that he never offered any “promises or commitments” regarding the Mueller or any other investigation.

Nadler pressed Whitaker over whether he had shared information about the investigation with Trump, or any White House officials.

“I do not intend today to talk about my private conversations, but to answer your question, I did not talk to the president about the status of the investigation,” Whitaker answered. “Consistent with what I’ve already said, I have not talked about the special counsel’s investigation with any White House officials.”

Whitaker did not directly answer several of Nadler’s other questions, resulting in the chairman requesting that the acting attorney general return to the committee at a later date.

“I’ve given you a fair opportunity so that we could avoid this fight in the first place, but you don’t appear to have done any of that,” Nadler said, referring to Whitaker’s preparations, while saying, “I do not believe issuing a subpoena here would correct the problem.” Nadler explained that the committee would “attempt to reach an accommodation with the department to receive answers,” so Whitaker can return for “deposition before the committee, under oath.”

Nadler said that, at that point, he expects “clean answers or proper assertion of privilege claimed by the president.”

Meanwhile, the top Republican on the committee blasted the hearing as a ""dog and pony show.""

“This hearing is a character assassination on Acting Attorney General Whitaker, all pure political theater, to go after the president,” Ranking Member Doug Collins, R-Ga, said in his opening statement while urging the committee to adjourn.

WHITAKER: MUELLER PROBE IS 'CLOSE TO BEING COMPLETED'

A vote was then taken on whether to abruptly end the hearing. The measure did not pass, and the hearing began as scheduled.

The hearing follows an intense back and forth between the Justice Department and the Judiciary Committee a day earlier.

The Judiciary Committee voted Thursday to give Nadler the authority to issue a subpoena if necessary, despite Whitaker having already agreed to appear before the panel voluntarily.

Nadler made clear early Thursday that he did not want to have to subpoena Whitaker, but said a “series of troubling events” suggested it would be better for him to be prepared with that authority, just in case he decided not to show up for the hearing.

But Whitaker then warned he would not show up unless lawmakers dropped the threat.

Hours later, Nadler responded that if Whitaker appeared before the panel “prepared to respond to questions from our members, then I assure you there will be no need for the committee to issue a subpoena on or before February 8.”

Whitaker accepted the assurances and testified Friday.

The hearing Friday comes as the Senate is close to confirming Trump’s nominee for attorney general. The Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday voted, along party lines, to advance Barr’s nomination to the full Senate for confirmation.

The Nunes memo’s core allegation is that the FBI and Department of Justice misled at least one federal judge on a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court during the Trump-Russia investigation.

In October 2016, the FBI requested a FISA warrant to spy on former Trump campaign aide Carter Page. FBI and DOJ officials argued that Page had troubling connections to the Kremlin, and wanted to check him out as part of their overall investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia.

Russia threatened to retaliate for a new round of sanctions announced by the U.S. , as the ruble slid amid the spiraling tensions between the Cold War rivals .
The U.S. said it was imposing the new restrictions to punish President Vladimir Putin ’ s government for the March 4 nerve-agent attack on former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the U.K .
The moves came just days after a bipartisan group of senators proposed a law mandating “ crushing sanctions ” -- including on purchase of new sovereign debt and on big state banks -- to punish Russia for election interference .
The threatened measures spooked investors , driving the ruble to the lowest levels since 2016 , though it later made up some of the drop . Stocks like Aeroflot and VTB , which could be targeted by some of the new restrictions , fell more than 7 percent but recovered most of their losses .
“ It ’ s hard to tell the extent of the sell-off , ” said Viktor Szabo , a money manager at Aberdeen Standard in London . “ The question is whether these sanctions will reach key energy and financial names and also the sovereign . All of these are mentioned in at least one of the draft bills and add the August low liquidity environment , which amplifies the market moves . ”
After last month ’ s summit in Helsinki , where President Donald Trump was widely criticized for failing to call Putin to account over the election meddling , the U.S. administration is under pressure to take tougher steps against Russia , even as Trump himself has called for closer ties . For Putin , a meeting that seemed a triumph is increasingly looking like a liability as hopes of rapprochement with Washington are put off .
“ Such measures are absolutely unfriendly and can hardly be associated with the constructive -- difficult but constructive -- atmosphere at the last meeting of the two presidents , ” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on a conference call .
The latest U.S. restrictions are required under the 1991 Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act , which mandates punishment of countries that use chemical weapons in violation of international law . The first wave of new sanctions is to take effect Aug. 22 . More sweeping measures could come 90 days later .
The initial round of these sanctions will limit exports to Russia of U.S. goods and technology considered sensitive on national security grounds , including electronics , lasers and some specialized oil and gas production technologies , according to a State Department official who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity Thursday . The official said the action could block hundreds of millions of dollars in exports . Waivers will be allowed for space-flight activities and U.S. foreign assistance .
Russia ’ s response was defiant but stopped short of specific measures pending more details on the U.S. plans . Officials said Russia may respond by imposing restrictions on trade with the U.S. under a law passed earlier this year in response to an earlier wave of penalties . That could include cutting off supplies of rocket engines needed for U.S. space launches , one official said , as well as aviation .
“ The law allows the government to take retaliatory measures that are appropriate to the sanctions pressure , ” said Dmitry Mezentsev , chairman of the economic policy committee in the upper house of parliament . “ The Russian economy is big and stable enough that we aren ’ t scared by steps like this . ”
Under the 1991 law -- invoked previously only against North Korea and Syria -- a second , far more extensive round of sanctions would follow later unless Russia meets conditions including providing assurances it will no longer use chemical or biological weapons and will allow on-site inspections to verify it has stopped doing so , the official said .
Russia Thursday repeated its denials that it has the weapons or used them and held out little hope for compromise .
“ Demands that are obviously unacceptable for us are being made as a condition of lifting sanctions , ” Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters in Moscow Thursday .
The added sanctions could include a downgrading in diplomatic relations , blanket bans on the import of Russian oil and exports of “ all other goods and technology ” aside from agricultural products , as well as limits on loans from U.S. banks . The U.S. also would have to suspend aviation agreements and oppose any multilateral development bank assistance .
The additional sanctions also could be averted if Trump declared that waiving them would be in the U.S. national interest , a politically risky move in light of criticism that he ’ s been too soft on Russia on issues including interference in the 2016 presidential campaign .","LISTEN TO ARTICLE 4:15 SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email

The threatened measures spooked investors, driving the ruble to the lowest levels since 2016, though it later made up some of the drop. Stocks like Aeroflot and VTB, which could be targeted by some of the new restrictions, fell more than 7 percent but recovered most of their losses.

“It’s hard to tell the extent of the sell-off,” said Viktor Szabo, a money manager at Aberdeen Standard in London. “The question is whether these sanctions will reach key energy and financial names and also the sovereign. All of these are mentioned in at least one of the draft bills and add the August low liquidity environment, which amplifies the market moves.”

QuickTake: Sanctions on Russia

Helsinki Hangover

After last month’s summit in Helsinki, where President Donald Trump was widely criticized for failing to call Putin to account over the election meddling, the U.S. administration is under pressure to take tougher steps against Russia, even as Trump himself has called for closer ties. For Putin, a meeting that seemed a triumph is increasingly looking like a liability as hopes of rapprochement with Washington are put off.

“Such measures are absolutely unfriendly and can hardly be associated with the constructive -- difficult but constructive -- atmosphere at the last meeting of the two presidents,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on a conference call.

The latest U.S. restrictions are required under the 1991 Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act, which mandates punishment of countries that use chemical weapons in violation of international law. The first wave of new sanctions is to take effect Aug. 22. More sweeping measures could come 90 days later.

The initial round of these sanctions will limit exports to Russia of U.S. goods and technology considered sensitive on national security grounds, including electronics, lasers and some specialized oil and gas production technologies, according to a State Department official who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity Thursday. The official said the action could block hundreds of millions of dollars in exports. Waivers will be allowed for space-flight activities and U.S. foreign assistance.

Russia’s response was defiant but stopped short of specific measures pending more details on the U.S. plans. Officials said Russia may respond by imposing restrictions on trade with the U.S. under a law passed earlier this year in response to an earlier wave of penalties. That could include cutting off supplies of rocket engines needed for U.S. space launches, one official said, as well as aviation.

“The law allows the government to take retaliatory measures that are appropriate to the sanctions pressure,” said Dmitry Mezentsev, chairman of the economic policy committee in the upper house of parliament. “The Russian economy is big and stable enough that we aren’t scared by steps like this.”

Under the 1991 law -- invoked previously only against North Korea and Syria -- a second, far more extensive round of sanctions would follow later unless Russia meets conditions including providing assurances it will no longer use chemical or biological weapons and will allow on-site inspections to verify it has stopped doing so, the official said.

Russia Thursday repeated its denials that it has the weapons or used them and held out little hope for compromise.

“Demands that are obviously unacceptable for us are being made as a condition of lifting sanctions,” Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters in Moscow Thursday.

The added sanctions could include a downgrading in diplomatic relations, blanket bans on the import of Russian oil and exports of “all other goods and technology” aside from agricultural products, as well as limits on loans from U.S. banks. The U.S. also would have to suspend aviation agreements and oppose any multilateral development bank assistance.

The additional sanctions also could be averted if Trump declared that waiving them would be in the U.S. national interest, a politically risky move in light of criticism that he’s been too soft on Russia on issues including interference in the 2016 presidential campaign.

WASHINGTON — House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Sunday dismissed the need for Congress to protect Robert Mueller, the special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation, despite recent reports that President Trump wanted to fire Robert Mueller last year.

""I don't think there's a need for legislation right now to protect Mueller,"" McCarthy said on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""

The No. 2 Republican in the House said Trump has fully cooperated with Mueller's team and ""I think we'll just continue this investigation to see where it goes.""

But after reports last week that Trump ordered Mueller fired and White House counsel Don McGahn refused, there is growing support among some Senate Republicans for stepping in to protect Mueller through bipartisan legislation introduced in August.

""It probably wouldn't hurt for us to pass one of those bills,"" Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" In December, Collins had said she did not see the need for such legislation.

The New York Times, followed by The Washington Post, reported Thursday evening that Trump issued an order to have Mueller fired in June. McGhan refused to tell the Justice Department to carry it out, saying he would quit instead, the Times reported, quoting two unnamed sources.

Trump has said the reports that he wanted to fire Mueller are ""fake news.""

USA TODAY reported Friday that Trump expressed interest in firing Mueller but was talked out of it by his legal team, according to two people familiar with the incident..

Asked about those reports, White House legislative director Marc Short said Sunday he's ""not aware the president ever intimated that he wanted to fire Robert Mueller.""

""“We have continued to comply fully"" with the investigation, Short told Fox News Sunday. ""Robert Mueller is still special counsel.""

A bill sponsored by South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham and New Jersey Democrat Cory Booker would require the attorney general to seek approval from a federal court prior to removing a special counsel.

Graham said Mueller is ""the perfect guy to get to the bottom of this,"" and his bill would give Mueller ""the space to do it.""

""I'll be glad to pass it tomorrow,"" Graham said on ABC's “This Week with George Stephanopoulos,”

In addition to Graham's bill, one sponsored by Republican Sen.Tom Tillis of North Carolina and Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware would allow the attorney general to remove a special counsel only for specific reasons, including misconduct, dereliction of duty or conflict of interest.

Collins said there are some constitutional issues with the proposed legislation.

""But it would certainly not hurt,"" she said, ""to put that extra safeguard in place given the latest stories.""

Sen. Charles Grassley, the Iowa Republican who chairs the Judiciary Committee, has said he is open to considering the bills if the differences between them could be reconciled, and if supporters could address constitutional concerns that the bills would represent the legislative branch meddling in the affairs of the executive.

But many Republicans on Capitol Hill say they want to wait for the completion of investigations underway by congressional committees before considering new legislation.

Before sentencing , Cohen ripped into his former boss in federal court , telling the judge he felt it was his duty to cover up the president 's “ dirty deeds . ”
Cohen appeared before U.S. District Judge William Pauley III for sentencing after pleading guilty to campaign finance violations , tax evasion and lying to Congress about Trump ’ s past business dealings in Russia . He was seen entering the Manhattan courthouse Wednesday accompanied by members of his family .

In court , a contrite Cohen told the judge he takes “ full responsibility for each act , ” saying the “ sooner I am sentenced , the sooner I can return to my family . ''
Cohen also apologized to the people of the United States , saying , `` You deserve to know the truth . ''
The sentence , while not the maximum , signifies a remarkable fall for the hard-charging lawyer who for years was part of Trump ’ s inner circle .

But on Friday , federal prosecutors recommended a “ substantial term of imprisonment ” for Cohen , saying his efforts to cooperate with Mueller have been “ overstated. ” Federal prosecutors said that Cohen was “ motivated ” by “ personal greed ” and “ repeatedly used his power and influence for deceptive ends . ”
Among other charges , Cohen recently pleaded guilty to misleading Congress about his work on a proposal to build a Trump skyscraper in Moscow , hiding the fact that he continued to speak with Russians about the proposal well into the presidential campaign .
In the New York case , prosecutors accused Cohen of a years-long “ tax evasion scheme ” to avoid paying federal income taxes on more than $ 4 million made through a number of ventures , including through his ownership of taxi medallions , his selling of real estate in Florida and his consulting work for other clients .
Cohen also pleaded guilty in August to breaking campaign finance laws by helping orchestrate payments to silence former Playboy model Karen McDougal and adult film actress Stormy Daniels , who said they had sexual encounters with Trump while he was married .
Prosecutors said Cohen orchestrated payments to McDougal and Daniels at Trump 's direction .

In a pair of tweets , Trump reiterated his defense from Thursday saying he was doing nothing wrong in running his business during the 2016 presidential campaign . The controversy over Trump pursuing construction of a Trump Tower in Russia bubbled to the surface after his former personal attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to making false statements about his involvement in pursuing the deal .

Against all odds , I decide to run for President & continue to run my business-very legal & very cool , talked about it on the campaign trail .

Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) November 30 , 2018
.... Lightly looked at doing a building somewhere in Russia . Put up zero money , zero guarantees and didn ’ t do the project . Witch Hunt ! — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) November 30 , 2018
Trump called Cohen a `` weak person '' shortly after news broke earlier Thursday that Cohen had pleaded guilty to making false statements to Congress in a deal with special counsel Robert Mueller -- a groundbreaking development in the investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 election .
`` He 's a liar , '' Trump said as he left the White House for a summit in Argentina . `` He 's a weak person and what he 's trying to do is get a reduced sentence . ''
Cohen appeared in federal court in Manhattan Thursday where he entered a guilty plea to making misstatements to Congress in closed-door testimony last year about his contacts with Russians during the 2016 presidential campaign .
`` What he 's trying to do , because he 's a weak person and not a very smart person , what he 's trying to do is end -- and it 's very simple , he 's got himself a big prison sentence and he 's trying to get a much lesser prison sentence by making up a story , '' Trump said , speaking to reporters on the White House South Lawn before getting on his helicopter .
Cohen 's dealings while serving as a senior executive in Trump ’ s global empire include several projects thought to be of interest to Mueller ’ s prosecutors , most notably the pursuit of a Trump Tower project in Moscow during the presidential campaign .
According to court documents , Cohen falsely told Congress the Moscow project ended in January 2016 . He then continued to look into business plans on that deal , according to the court filing .
Cohen made false statements `` in hopes of limiting the ongoing Russia investigations , '' according to the filing signed by Mueller .
Trump said Cohen was lying about the project details and insisted there would not have been anything wrong with continuing business dealings during the campaign .
`` Now , here 's the thing , even if he was right , it does n't matter , because I was allowed to do whatever I wanted during the campaign , '' Trump said . `` There was a good chance that I would n't have won , in which case I would have gotten back into the business and why should I lose lots of opportunities ? '' Trump said .
Trump said he ultimately decided to pass on the project `` for a lot of reasons , '' but primarily because he was focused on running for president .
`` It lasted a short period of time . I did n't do the project . I decided not to do the project , so I did n't do it , '' Trump said . `` This deal was a very public deal . Everybody knows about this deal . I was n't trying to hide anything , okay ? ''
When asked why , if Cohen is `` weak '' and a `` liar , '' the president kept a close relationship with him for over a decade , Trump gave a vague response .
`` Because a long time ago he did me a favor . A long time ago he did me a favor , '' Trump said .
Despite the plea deal , Trump said he 's `` not worried at all '' about what Cohen might be telling Mueller .
Cohen has spent more than 70 hours in interviews with Mueller 's team since coming to another plea deal in August with federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York that in which Cohen implicated Trump in campaign finance felonies .
Speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill , Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff , the incoming chairman of the House Intelligence Committee , called Thursday 's news a `` very significant plea and statement . ''
`` It means that when the president was representing during the campaign that he had no business interests in Russia , that that wasn ’ t true , and when Mr. Cohen testified before our committee , as well as the Senate , and made representations about when the business dealing with Russia stopped , that wasn ’ t true , '' Schiff said .
`` This , I think , only underscores the importance of our bringing back Mr. Cohen before our committee , but also looking into this issue of whether the Russians possess financial leverage over the president of the United States , '' he said .
Trump , as he did Thursday , has previously denied that he has any business deals with Russia , tweeting shortly before he was inaugurated , `` I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA -- NO DEALS , NO LOANS , NO NOTHING ! ''","President Donald Trump defended his actions pursuing a business deal in Russia, calling it ""very legal & very cool"" as he woke up in Argentina on Friday morning to start his day at the G-20 summit.

Trump tweeted: ""I am a very good developer, happily living my life, when I see our Country going in the wrong direction (to put it mildly). Against all odds, I decide to run for President & continue to run my business-very legal & very cool, talked about it on the campaign trail. Lightly looked at doing a building somewhere in Russia. Put up zero money, zero guarantees and didn’t do the project. Witch Hunt!""

Oh, I get it! I am a very good developer, happily living my life, when I see our Country going in the wrong direction (to put it mildly). Against all odds, I decide to run for President & continue to run my business-very legal & very cool, talked about it on the campaign trail... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 30, 2018

....Lightly looked at doing a building somewhere in Russia. Put up zero money, zero guarantees and didn’t do the project. Witch Hunt! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 30, 2018

Trump called Cohen a ""weak person"" shortly after news broke earlier Thursday that Cohen had pleaded guilty to making false statements to Congress in a deal with special counsel Robert Mueller -- a groundbreaking development in the investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 election.

""He's a liar,"" Trump said as he left the White House for a summit in Argentina. ""He's a weak person and what he's trying to do is get a reduced sentence.""

Cohen appeared in federal court in Manhattan Thursday where he entered a guilty plea to making misstatements to Congress in closed-door testimony last year about his contacts with Russians during the 2016 presidential campaign.

""What he's trying to do, because he's a weak person and not a very smart person, what he's trying to do is end -- and it's very simple, he's got himself a big prison sentence and he's trying to get a much lesser prison sentence by making up a story,"" Trump said, speaking to reporters on the White House South Lawn before getting on his helicopter.

Cohen's dealings while serving as a senior executive in Trump’s global empire include several projects thought to be of interest to Mueller’s prosecutors, most notably the pursuit of a Trump Tower project in Moscow during the presidential campaign.

According to court documents, Cohen falsely told Congress the Moscow project ended in January 2016. He then continued to look into business plans on that deal, according to the court filing.

Cohen made false statements ""in hopes of limiting the ongoing Russia investigations,"" according to the filing signed by Mueller.

Trump said Cohen was lying about the project details and insisted there would not have been anything wrong with continuing business dealings during the campaign.

""Now, here's the thing, even if he was right, it doesn't matter, because I was allowed to do whatever I wanted during the campaign,"" Trump said. ""There was a good chance that I wouldn't have won, in which case I would have gotten back into the business and why should I lose lots of opportunities?"" Trump said.

Trump said he ultimately decided to pass on the project ""for a lot of reasons,"" but primarily because he was focused on running for president.

""It lasted a short period of time. I didn't do the project. I decided not to do the project, so I didn't do it,"" Trump said. ""This deal was a very public deal. Everybody knows about this deal. I wasn't trying to hide anything, okay?""

When asked why, if Cohen is ""weak"" and a ""liar,"" the president kept a close relationship with him for over a decade, Trump gave a vague response.

""Because a long time ago he did me a favor. A long time ago he did me a favor,"" Trump said.

Despite the plea deal, Trump said he's ""not worried at all"" about what Cohen might be telling Mueller.

Cohen has spent more than 70 hours in interviews with Mueller's team since coming to another plea deal in August with federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York that in which Cohen implicated Trump in campaign finance felonies.

Speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill, Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, the incoming chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, called Thursday's news a ""very significant plea and statement.""

""It means that when the president was representing during the campaign that he had no business interests in Russia, that that wasn’t true, and when Mr. Cohen testified before our committee, as well as the Senate, and made representations about when the business dealing with Russia stopped, that wasn’t true,"" Schiff said.

""This, I think, only underscores the importance of our bringing back Mr. Cohen before our committee, but also looking into this issue of whether the Russians possess financial leverage over the president of the United States,"" he said.

Trump, as he did Thursday, has previously denied that he has any business deals with Russia, tweeting shortly before he was inaugurated, ""I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA -- NO DEALS, NO LOANS, NO NOTHING!""",www.abcnews.go.com,left,YHlH5Qly5CGK4cTu

TRUMP PUSH TO INVALIDATE OBAMACARE SPARKED CLASH WITHIN ADMINISTRATION

That’s how things have gone for Republicans on health care for a while. It also explains the private reluctance of many GOPers to drift down the perilous health care path again.

Congressional Republicans have taken dozens of votes over the past decade to repeal ObamaCare. But they’ve never closed the deal with a package to succeed the health care law.

Republicans hoped things might be different under President Trump.

The GOP initially struggled with “replace” in the House in the spring of 2017. This was the first time Republicans had played with live ammo. In other words, there were consequences to repealing ObamaCare. House GOPers had to have something ready to fill the gap. Furthermore, Republicans had a bill which could actually become law.

Russian-linked trolls and bots also tried to exploit divisive issues and undermine faith in public institutions. Federal investigators and experts believed Russian trolls created Facebook groups like Blacktivist, which reposted videos of police beatings, or another, Secured Borders, which organized anti-immigrant rallies in real life. “Today, Russia hopes to win the second Cold War through the force of politics as opposed to the politics of force.” How can you stop them? You can’t. Even Vladimir Putin seems to agree. But ID’ing their tactics helps contain their influence. If a suspicious account is active during the workday in St. Petersburg or posting dozens of items a day, those are red flags. Decode the anonymity. Look for alphanumeric scrambles in a user’s name, and try Googling its profile picture. Look at the language. If an account makes grammar mistakes typical for Russian speakers, or changes behavior during times of strained Russian-U.S. relations, then congratulations. You might have caught a bot or pro-Kremlin troll.",www.nytimes.com,left,4PMOuPvBhK3GT7yM

US opposition politicians are calling for Donald Trump's interpreter to testify before Congress about his summit talks with Vladimir Putin.

The lead Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Robert Menendez, called for Marina Gross to be subpoenaed to appear at the committee.

Controversy has raged over the summit, with Mr Trump having to correct his own words from the press conference.

However, it would be highly unusual for an interpreter to be questioned.

At their first bilateral summit, the two leaders met privately for two hours in the Finnish capital Helsinki on Monday with only their interpreters present.

Mr Trump went ahead with the meeting despite continuing investigations into alleged Russian state interference in the 2016 US presidential election, which he won.

Confusion over Mr Trump's position took another turn when he appeared to reject suggestions that Russia might try again to influence American elections, prompting a hasty denial by the White House.

Why do they want the interpreter to speak?

Democrats argue that because she was the only other American official present in the room, Ms Gross can and should provide details of what the two presidents said to each other.

""We want the interpreter to come before the committee,"" Senator Menendez told MSNBC. ""We want to see the notes. We're going to have a massive effort to try to get to what happened.""

Democratic Representative Bill Pascrell said the ""concessions"" Mr Trump had made in public to Mr Putin meant ""Congress and the American public deserve to know the details of their private conversation"".

If Ms Gross declined to appear before the committee, she should be subpoenaed, he wrote.

""We need public testimony by the only American present at this meeting to ensure Trump did not further undermine our intelligence or law enforcement communities,"" he said.

Will she come forward?

Interpreters are normally meant to be all but invisible at summits and Ms Gross is a US state department employee with years of experience translating at the highest level, CNN reports.

Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he would consider the calls to summon her but questioned the idea.

""They're not policy people,"" he told reporters, as quoted by AFP news agency.

""They are in some cases contract folks. In the future, would any notes even be allowed to be taken if you started doing this kind of thing?""

He also pointed out that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who was in Helsinki with Mr Trump, would be questioned by the committee next week.

In Russia, Konstantin Kosachev, head of the foreign affairs committee in the upper house of parliament, said the idea of questioning an interpreter set a dangerous precedent that threatened the ""whole idea of diplomacy"", the Associated Press reports.

Gamal Helal, an Arabic interpreter and senior adviser to four US presidents and seven secretaries of state, told CNN he could not remember such a situation.

""It would be a horrible precedent if a president wasn't free to talk one-on-one with a head of state..."" he said. ""If he [Mr Trump] spoke in English, there would be no other way for Congress to know what he said, except to ask the president himself. Or Putin.""

Why is there such controversy?

While the summit was held behind closed doors the two leaders gave a news conference afterwards at which Mr Trump shocked many by defending Russia over the allegations of election interference.

Contradicting his own intelligence agencies, he said there had been no reason for Russia to meddle in the vote.

A day later, Mr Trump came out to say he had ""misspoken"" and did actually accept US intelligence agencies' findings that Russia had interfered.

However, a new row developed when the US leader appeared to disagree with US intelligence over whether Russia was still targeting American elections.

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – The world got its first glimpse on Sunday into the investigation that has cast a cloud over Donald Trump's presidency.

After two days reading through Special Counsel Robert Mueller's confidential report, Attorney General William Barr sent a letter to Congress offering a summary of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible links to Trump's campaign.

In Barr's letter, he said that no proof was found that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia but said no decision was made over whether the president obstructed justice. Barr said that Mueller's office left that charging decision to him and the Justice Department.

""The Special Counsel states that 'while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him,'"" the letter states, quoting from the special counsel investigation.

Barr added that after review, he and Deputy Attorney General Rob Rosenstein ""have concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel's investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.""

Trump reacted to the news on Twitter as he prepared to leave Mar-a-Lago, his private resort in Palm Beach, Fla., writing ""No Collusion, No Obstruction, Complete and Total EXONERATION. KEEP AMERICA GREAT!""

But Barr's letter and his summary of the Mueller probe is really just the beginning, with lawmakers already pushing for the complete release of the investigation and underlying evidence.

Here's what we know, what we don't know, and what we might never find out:

Mueller report: Special counsel Robert Mueller delivers report marking end of investigation into Trump's campaign, Russia

Mueller report: Read Attorney General Barr's letter to Congress announcing end of Mueller's Russia probe

Opinion:Mueller completes his report. Now let's see it.

Did Mueller find collusion?

Nope, according to the attorney general.

""The Special Counsel's investigation did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election,"" Barr wrote in a letter to Congress summarizing Mueller's investigation.

Barr noted that this came ""despite multiple offers from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign.""

This was seen as a win for the president, who for years has railed against the investigation and repeatedly said there was no collusion with Russia.

""It was just announced that there was no collusion with Russia, the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. There was no collusion, folk,"" Trump said as he boarded Air Force One on the way back to Washington.

Did the president obstruct justice?

That isn't really clear.

After years investigating, Mueller didn't say yes or no. Instead, he offered the evidence he had to Barr.

Mueller ""did not grat a conclusion — one way or the other — as to whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction,"" Barr notes in his letter to Congress. He noted Mueller's office laid out evidence ""on both sides"" of the question as to whether Trump committed a crime.

""The Special Counsel states that 'while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him,'"" Barr wrote, quoting from Mueller's investigation.

Barr said after examining the investigation, departmental policies and talking with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, he decided there was not enough proof that Trump committed a crime.

""I have concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel's investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense,"" Barr wrote.

What happens Next?

This letter tees up a massive push to have the entirety of the report released to the public.

Democrats have been very vocal in pushing for everything, including the underlying evidence, to be released. After Barr's letter, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., said he would be calling Barr to testify before the committee in coming days.

Barr's letter was just a written summary of Mueller's findings – essentially parts of the report that Barr believes he can share in accordance with Justice Department rules. The only information Barr is required to reveal is whether Mueller's bosses overruled his investigative actions. And Barr said that did not happen.

How big is the report?

We don't know. The Justice Department said it was ""comprehensive,"" but didn't elaborate. A security officer from Mueller's office delivered a printed copy to the offices of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who turned it over to Barr on Friday afternoon.

Will we get to read the Mueller report?

It's too soon to tell.

What's certain is that there will be a fight in Congress to make the report public. Lawmakers and Trump have indicated that they want the report to become public. But it's unclear if that will stand after the nation found out Mueller could not determine whether the president committed a crime.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a conference call with Democrats on Saturday that she would reject any classified briefings of congressional intelligence leaders, known as the ""Gang of Eight."" Any briefings, she said, should be unclassified so the American public can be informed, according to an official who was on the call.

Barr told lawmakers that he was ""committed to as much transparency as possible."" But he did not say he would release Mueller's complete report. Instead, he said he would consult with Mueller and Rosenstein to ""determine what other information from the report can be released consistent with the law ... and the Department's long-standing practices and policies.""

Barr has said that the department often cannot reveal information about grand juries, or ""derogatory"" information about people who have not been charged with a crime.

What happens to Mueller?

Peter Carr, Mueller's spokesman, said the special counsel would be ""concluding his service in the coming days."" A small staff would remain to close down Mueller's office. The office had already confirmed that some of his prosecutors and investigators were leaving for other jobs.

So Mueller came up empty?

The investigation has led to charges against some of Trump's closest advisers.

And we know what investigators believe the 13 Russian nationals and a Russian troll farm did to disrupt U.S. politics and tilt the presidential election in Trump's favor.

It's still unclear whether Mueller's report will speak to a pattern among those cases. ""That's part of what the Mueller report is for. One of the things the Mueller report will do is it will attempt to put all of the indictments Mueller has brought into an overall context,"" said Patrick Cotter, a white-collar defense attorney and a former federal prosecutor.

What did we know already?

In hundreds of pages of court filings, Mueller's office revealed an extensive Russian intelligence operation that used hacking, stolen documents and phony social media campaigns to sow discord in U.S. politics and support Trump's campaign for the presidency. It revealed that some of Trump's aides worked eagerly to benefit from that operation, seeking damaging information from Russians even as Trump was seeking out business in the country. And it revealed that many of Trump's aides then lied to Congress, federal investigators and the public to downplay those connections.

What about other people?

Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, for example. They, along with Manafort, met on June 9, 2016 at Trump Tower with Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya and several other Russians. The meeting occurred after Trump Jr. was promised it would yield dirt on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. That meeting was a focal point of Mueller's investigation, but the fact that no one has faced charges for it suggests Mueller's team didn't think it amounted to a crime.

All the lies?

The special counsel's investigation revealed an extensive pattern of perjury. Several of Trump's former advisers, including Flynn, Cohen and Stone, either admitted to or were accused of lying. Will Mueller address that in his report? Cotter hopes so.

""Because to a federal prosecutor, I think that it is a strikingly unusual aspect on this whole case. That so many people lied to investigators,"" Cotter said.

Is this the end?

No.

Mueller referred his investigation on Cohen's criminal activities to federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, who opened an inquiry into illegal hush-money payments to silence two women who claimed to have had sex with Trump. Justice Department investigators have also been examining lobbying firms tied to Manafort, and Trump's inaugural committee.

The department hasn't said whether Mueller's office made any other referrals.

What's been happening in Moscow?

Authorities have launched an investigation into the protests.

On Friday, they detained a number of men - including Alexey Minyaylo, an independent politician and aide to Ms Sobol - in connection with the ""mass unrest"", a charge which carries a sentence of up to 15 years in jail.

Opposition politician Konstantin Yankauskas, who is one of the banned election candidates, completed a seven-day jail sentence on Saturday - and was immediately re-arrested as he left the detention facility.

Alexei Navalny has also been arrested in connection with the rallies.

He fell ill in jail with a swollen face and rashes over his body, and was briefly hospitalised.

Doctors said he had had an extreme allergic reaction, but Mr Navalny and his personal doctor said he may have been poisoned.",www.bbc.com,center,tuYOe0kym68NscuE

USA TODAY

Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, in a phone call Saturday with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, said U.S. charges against a Russian woman as a Moscow government agent were ""fabricated"" and demanded her immediate release.

Maria Butina, a 29-year-old Russian citizen, was arrested last weekend and charged with infiltrating American political organizations, including the National Rifle Association.

Lavrov discussed the issue by phone with Pompeo in a follow-up conversation to the summit between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to a statement by the Russian foreign ministry on its Facebook page.

In the phone call, Lavrov stressed ""the unacceptability of the actions of the U.S. authorities, who have arrested Russian citizen Maria Butina in the United States on the basis of fabricated charges, and the need for her early release,"" according to Interfax.

Prosecutors say Butina engaged in a years-long campaign as a covert agent for the Kremlin in an attempt to ""advance the interests of her home country.""

""The defendant's covert influence campaign involved substantial planning, international coordination and preparation,"" prosecutors wrote in a court filing. ""The plan for Butina also required, and she demonstrated, a willingness to use deceit in a visa application to move to the United States and bring the plan to fruition.""

Butina pleaded not guilty.

The two men also discussed Syria as well as efforts to promote the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.

Russia has been steadily beating the drum on Butina's behalf. On Thursday, the Russian foreign ministry announced a #FreeMariaButina campaign. A tweet by the foreign ministry called on supporters to add a photo of Butina to their Twitter avatars.

Anatoly Antonov, the Russian ambassador to the U.S., told a conference in Moscow on Friday that the allegations are groundless and that American authorities tried to “break her” and refused her consular visits for the first few days after her arrest, The Associated Press reported.

In jailing Butina pending her trial, Magistrate Deborah Robinson sided with federal prosecutors who argued that the Russian represented an “extreme” flight risk. Federal agents said that at the time of Butina's arrest, her apartment was packed with boxes ""consistent with a move."" Butina's attorney, Robert Driscoll, said the packing boxes were in preparation for a move to South Dakota – not back to Russia – where Driscoll said she intended to live with her boyfriend.

The charges are not related to Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller's ongoing inquiry into Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election. Rather, the case was announced by the U.S. attorney's office in Washington, where federal investigators asserted Butina has been operating as a covert Russian agent since her arrival in August 2016.

The timing of the charging announcement, however, came on the same day that a summit in Helsinki between Trump and Putin put a spotlight on accusations of Russian meddling in the 2016 election. After meeting with Putin, Trump accepted Putin's denials that Russia had interfered in the U.S. election. The president's comments prompted lawmaker outrage and the release of a rare statement from Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats underscoring Russia's role.

Yes , in theory , the probe could go on for years , and he could be indicted after his presidency—though , at this point , any such speculation is transparently absurd . The simple fact is this : Trump is not a target : “ Prosecutors view someone as a subject when that person has engaged in conduct that is under investigation but there is not sufficient evidence to bring charges . ”
If he ’ s not a “ target , ” then the reports Mueller will write about his investigation will not rise to the level of indictable offenses .

Yes, the story goes on to say that he might become a target later. But Mueller has been at this now for nine months with an aggressive staff. He has issued indictments of various figures and might be going after others. So telling Trump that he’s not a target is a very big deal.

Yes, in theory, Trump could testify before Mueller and perjure himself because of his highly problematic relationship to the truth. Yes, in theory, the probe could go on for years, and he could be indicted after his presidency—though, at this point, any such speculation is transparently absurd. The simple fact is this: Trump is not a target: “Prosecutors view someone as a subject when that person has engaged in conduct that is under investigation but there is not sufficient evidence to bring charges.”

If he’s not a “target,” then the reports Mueller will write about his investigation will not rise to the level of indictable offenses. Remember, the only real threat to Trump’s continuing tenure would come from Mueller writing a document that effectively refers the matter to Congress for impeachment. It would still be necessary for the House itself to draft a bill of impeachment and vote on it. At which point, the matter would then become the province of a Senate trial, requiring 67 senators to vote to remove him from office. It’s almost impossible to imagine that happening in the first place, let alone if Mueller isn’t finding anything after nine solid months of investigations.

This story could very well be game over for everyone who has hoped against hope that the Mueller probe was going serve as the deus ex machina of the #Resistance and surgically remove Trump from the presidency.",www.commentarymagazine.com,right,zeHaCD4jYGzTMqGE

USA TODAY

HELSINKI – President Donald Trump accepted denials by Russian President Vladimir Putin that Moscow interfered with the 2016 U.S. election Monday, bringing swift condemnation from members of Congress from both parties.

After meeting privately with Putin for two hours in Helsinki, Trump said he held both the United States and Russia responsible for the deterioration in relations between the two countries. ""I think that the United States has been foolish. I think we've all been foolish,"" he said.

Trump also declined to challenge Putin's insistence that his country did not meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, even though U.S. intelligence agencies under two administrations and the Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee concluded that Moscow sought to skew the election toward Trump.

""I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today,"" Trump told a joint news conference with the Russian president.

""I have President Putin; he just said it's not Russia,"" Trump said. ""I will say this: I don't see any reason why it would be.""

Trump's embrace of Putin came on the last day of a weeklong European trip in which he berated NATO allies over their defense spending and undercut British Prime Minister Theresa May in the tabloids.

His handling of the Putin meeting drew scathing reactions from lawmakers.

Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., said Trump had made the United States look like ""a pushover"" and said the president's remarks ""saddened"" him. Corker added that he thought Putin was likely celebrating the outcome of the meeting.

“I would guess he’s having caviar right now,” said Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., described the meeting in Helsinki as a ""tragic mistake.""

“No prior president has ever abased himself more abjectly before a tyrant,“ said McCain, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. “President Trump proved not only unable, but unwilling to stand up to Putin.""

On Friday, the Justice Department laid out details of what it said was a far-reaching hacking scheme in an indictment of 12 Russian agents whom it accused of trying to undermine the U.S. election.

Putin told reporters through a translator that he was glad that Trump had defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election but said Moscow would ""never interfere in internal American affairs.""

Trump's refusal to challenge Putin's denials of election meddling prompted an unusual response from the president's own director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, who reasserted his belief that Moscow attempted to influence the outcome of the 2016 election.

""We have been clear in our assessments of Russian meddling,"" Coats said in a statement.

Lawmakers had urged Trump to press for the extradition of the 12 Russian intelligence agents named in the indictment but Putin did not commit to doing so.

Putin also suggested that the two countries form a joint working group on cybersecurity that would look into the election issue.

Putin proposed that same plan after they met at a Group of Seven summit in Germany last year. Trump initially supported it, but then reversed himself. Monday, he reversed himself again, calling it an ""interesting idea.""

Some lawmakers had also called on Trump to reiterate the U.S. position opposing Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea. Putin said that issue came up during their private meetings, but Trump did not discuss it during the press conference.

As he has done before, Trump attacked the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller into Russian election interference.

Trump said he ran a clean campaign and beat Clinton soundly in 2016.

“Zero collusion,"" Trump said. ""And it has had a negative impact upon the relationship of the two largest nuclear powers in the world. ... It’s ridiculous what’s going on with the probe.”

Jeff Flake says he will block all of President Trump ’ s judicial nominees until his bill to protect special counsel Robert Mueller goes to a vote .
Flake ’ s move comes after Trump forced Attorney General Jeff Sessions to resign and appointed Matt Whitaker , a Trump loyalist who has repeatedly criticized Mueller ’ s investigation , as acting attorney general . Trump had repeatedly railed against Sessions for recusing himself from overseeing the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election .
Flake has long been a critic of Trump but has mostly declined to use his leverage in the razor-thin Senate to hold up Republican judges . That changed Wednesday when Flake sought unanimous consent to bring his bill to protect Mueller forward for debate . Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused , blocking the bill .
Flake then declared he will vote to reject all judicial nominees . “ This is not a moment for our national leadership to be weak or irresolute , ” he said on the Senate floor .
Flake is the swing vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee and , with Democrats , can vote down judicial nominations . McConnell could still bring these nominations forward to the Senate floor against the will of the committee , but Flake said he doubts this would happen because it would alienate GOP senators .
“ I ’ d be surprised , because there ’ s such a slim margin on the floor . Some members are sticklers for precedent and you don ’ t want to get in the habit of basically nullifying a committee ’ s actions , ” said Flake .
McConnell has made confirming conservative judges to lifetime appointments one of his top priorities under the Trump administration . Dozens of nominations hang in the balance . If he were to bypass the Judicial Committee , Flake would need the help of just one more Republican senator to kill nominations . Flake said he is in talks with other Republicans to team up with him , but did not identify who .
The Senate Judiciary Committee passed the Mueller protection bill months ago , but Mitch McConnell repeatedly refused to bring it forward for a vote . He argued the bill is unnecessary because there is no sign that Trump will fire Mueller . Flake argues that is no longer true .
“ The justification given in April for not bringing it to the floor for a vote was that nobody was being fired , nothing to see here , special counsel Mueller was not in any danger . That clearly is not the case now , ” said Flake Wednesday .
The Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act , cosponsored by Democratic Sen. Chris Coons , would require that the special counsel could only be fired for good cause , and would allow for the courts to overturn the firing if good cause could not be proved .
Coons said he is certain the bill has the needed support of 60 senators to pass the Senate . But it has always faced very long odds of becoming law , given that it would require Trump signing on to a measure that limits his own powers .
Technically Trump can not fire Mueller on his own . Under current Justice Department regulations , only the attorney general can fire Mueller .
Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein , the department ’ s number two official , had overseen the Mueller investigation since Sessions recused himself last year . Whitaker ’ s appointment as acting attorney general puts him in charge of the probe , but Democrats have called on him to recuse himself as well .","WASHINGTON — Republican Sen.

Coons said he is certain the bill has the needed support of 60 senators to pass the Senate. But it has always faced very long odds of becoming law, given that it would require Trump signing on to a measure that limits his own powers.

Technically Trump cannot fire Mueller on his own. Under current Justice Department regulations, only the attorney general can fire Mueller.

WASHINGTON – When special counsel Robert Mueller submitted his long-awaited report on Friday, Attorney General William Barr told lawmakers he was reviewing the information and might be able to summarize the ""principal conclusions as soon as this weekend.""

Barr and his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, spent Saturday reviewing Mueller's report, as staff shuttled between their office suites. An official said that ""very few"" people have had access to the report. But the day ended with no conclusions.

The wait continues Sunday.

What the Justice Department provides could supply answers to questions that have loomed over the first two years of President Donald Trump's administration: Did his campaign coordinate with a Russian effort to sway the 2016 election, and did he seek to obstruct the inquiries that followed?

Rather than delivering the full report directly to lawmakers, Barr said he would review the confidential document to determine what could be released to Congress and the public. In his notification, Barr said neither the attorney general nor acting attorney general had blocked Mueller from pursuing any aspect of his investigation.

Trump was subdued on Saturday, ensconced in his private Mar-a-Lago resort and his nearby golf club.

Congressional Democrats and Republicans, many of whom were in their home districts, worked to determine how to respond when Mueller's conclusions arrive but had little to say publicly. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose chamber is conducting its own wide-ranging investigations of Trump, attended her granddaughter’s bowling party Friday night.

The probe mushroomed to include whether the campaign coordinated with Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 election, and whether the president himself attempted to obstruct it. And it produced a cascade of other criminal investigations targeting people around Trump, which have not yet concluded.

Mueller's investigation revealed an extensive Russian intelligence operation that used hacking, stolen documents and phony social media campaigns to sow discord in U.S. politics and support Trump's campaign for the presidency. It revealed that some of Trump's aides worked eagerly to benefit from that operation, seeking damaging information from Russians even as Trump was seeking out business in the country.

WASHINGTON – A historic clash is brewing between Congress and Attorney General William Barr over some of the most sensitive evidence in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.

Barr is reviewing Mueller's final report and said he hopes to reveal much of it by mid-April. House Democrats want it sooner. They signaled that their biggest fight won't be over how quickly they can read the report but whether they get access to some of the evidence Mueller gathered that did not lead to criminal charges.

The fight centers on evidence obtained using grand juries. Barr said federal law requires him to keep it secret, even though the government has disclosed it in previous high-profile cases. The evidence is particularly sensitive because grand juries give prosecutors the power to force reluctant witnesses to testify.

Democratic lawmakers said they need access to that evidence to get a clear picture of Russian interference in the 2016 election and how that benefited Donald Trump's presidential campaign, even if no Americans conspired with foreigners. They could launch a legal battle to obtain the information as soon as Wednesday.

“In many ways, I think the important thing is not so much the report, as the backup material,” said Paul Rosenzweig, who was a prosecutor on independent counsel Kenneth Starr’s team that investigated President Bill Clinton. When Starr's investigation ended, his team drove two cars loaded with boxes of paper and electronic files to Congress.

Mueller's investigation made extensive use of grand juries, but it is unclear how much of his final report relies on evidence they collected. His prosecutors summoned witnesses to testify before the grand jury about a meeting in 2016 at Trump Tower in which some of Trump's top aides were promised Russian ""dirt"" on Hillary Clinton and about overtures between Trump associates and WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy group Russian intelligence used to publish emails it stole from Democratic political organizations. Some of those details could prove embarrassing to Trump, even if they do not amount to evidence of a crime.

The investigation led to charges against Russians accused of attempting to influence the election and against a half-dozen Trump aides who prosecutors said lied during the inquiry. Barr said Mueller's investigation did not establish that Trump or his campaign conspired with Russian's election interference campaign.

Barr announced Friday he expects to release the redacted report by mid-April. ""Everyone will soon be able to read it on their own,"" he said.

House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., told Barr in a letter Friday that rather than wasting time and resources on keeping portions of the report from Congress, he should join lawmakers in asking a court to release all grand jury information, ""as has occurred in every similar investigation in the past.""

Democrats questioned Barr's motives for not turning over more.

“It’s a public document. It has to be turned over,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md. “But as the week goes on, it just seems like the smell of a whitewash and a cover-up is getting thicker and thicker.”

History of releasing secret evidence

Grand juries operate secretly to protect witnesses, to keep suspects from learning they are being investigated and to protect the privacy of people who are not charged with a crime. Federal law generally forbids the government from revealing grand juries' work. But in investigations into Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton, judges ordered the release of grand jury evidence because the public interest outweighed witness privacy.

Lawmakers of both parties urged the release of Mueller's entire report, so people can draw their own conclusions about what he found. Rep. Devin Nunes of California, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, told the Conservative Political Action Conference that he wants everything from Mueller – every email, every warrant ""for all of America to see.""

Trump said he has no objections, declaring Friday, ""I have nothing to hide.""

The president has called for the release of even more sensitive information that he and his allies said will show he was unfairly targeted by investigators. They focused in particular on secret surveillance warrants for a former campaign aide, Carter Page. Trump authorized the release of parts of those orders last year, the first time such information had been revealed publicly.

In previous investigations, special prosecutors and lawmakers asked federal judges overseeing the grand juries to release the evidence. In 1998, Starr released 8,000 pages of report, appendices and supplemental information about his investigation of Clinton that included transcripts of grand jury testimony and details about subpoenas. The release was approved by a special division of the D.C. federal appeals court.

Nick Akerman, an assistant special prosecutor during Watergate, said prosecutors got permission from a federal judge in Washington to release a “road map” of grand jury evidence to the House of Representatives for possible impeachment proceedings. Akerman, who is in private practice, said the public interest vastly outweighs the privacy interests of individuals in such cases.

“They certainly should go to court and get an order releasing this thing,” Akerman said of lawmakers seeking the Mueller report. “They’ve got an absolutely legitimate right to know what’s in there and should have every single fact that is in there and know exactly why Mueller made the decisions he made. Even worse, what you’ve got now is an attorney general who has basically sugarcoated the thing by making his own decision on obstruction of justice on a totally bogus ground.”

'I intend to fight'

House Democrats are preparing for just such a legal battle.

“The entire unfiltered report as well as the evidence underlying that report must be made available to the Congress and to the American people,” Nadler said. “I intend to fight for that transparency.”

The Justice Department declined to comment.

Barr said in a four-page notification to Congress on March 24 that he was working to protect “the integrity of grand jury proceedings.” Republican lawmakers agreed with the need to keep grand jury evidence confidential in cases where people weren’t charged with crimes.

The head of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said lawmakers should ""give Barr a reasonable amount of time to go through the report and make sure the grand jury testimony isn’t disclosed, which would violate the law.”

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said the report could be a tool to combat Russian attempts to interfere in U.S. politics, which he called ""dangerous and disturbing.""

Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said lawmakers must trace threads of Mueller's investigation that didn’t lead to criminal charges in an effort to protect the country from interference.

“The Russians helped elect Donald Trump. That is not subject to debate,” Himes said. “Donald Trump’s son and campaign were offered help, and instead of going to the FBI, they welcomed it. Turns out, that, according to Mueller, that doesn’t rise to the level of a chargeable conspiracy.”

That appears to be the growing consensus among Democrats . Rep. Adam Schiff ( D-CA ) , the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee , mentioned last week that the Obama administration could have done more . On CNN ’ s GPS with Fareed Zakaria , co-chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee Sen. Mark Warner ( D-VA ) , said that President Obama “ choked ” on Russia .
“ Do you think that the Obama administration choked and should have done more when they knew the Russians were interfering [ in the 2016 election ] ? ” asked Zakaria .
Yet , the Virginia Democrat tried to offer some cover , saying that there were many threads of information coming in and no one seemed to have been able to put them together . Really ? The Washington Post ’ s bombshell article reported that the Obama White House knew as soon as August of 2016 that Russia was interfering , and that they feared what the Russians might do if they responded . Hence , the bunker mentality , coupled with a weak post-election response , which amounted to a slap on wrist , according to former acting CIA Director Michael Morrell . He told CBS ’ s Face The Nation on June 25 that the Obama administration actually did a decent job coordinating with other states to shore up security efforts with their voting systems . Yet , he noted the response to all of this was an abject failure and did nothing to deter the Russians from engaging in other interference activities in the future [ emphasis mine ] :
I think they get a high grade , because I think they prevented this from being worse than it would have been otherwise . That 's first thing .
The second thing is the decision not to share fully with the American people what was happening . So , the Obama administration did not tell the American people that Putin was behind this and did not tell the American people what Putin was trying to do , hurt Hillary Clinton , support Donald Trump . That 's a big , big decision .
You know , the White House , I think , was exactly where David [ Ignatius of The Washington Post , another guest ] said they were , which is they did n't want to make this worse . But by not entering the playing field , they ceded it to Vladimir Putin . So , I give them a C on that , and I think historians are going to debate this for a long time .
The third issue is how to deter the Russians in the future from doing this again , and here I think they failed miserably . I give them an F , because the package they put together , the kicking the diplomats out , intelligence officers out , closing down a couple of compounds , putting limited sanctions on in no way -- it was a slap on the wrist to Vladimir Putin . He sees it that way . It will not deter him in the future .
Was this an election hack ? No . The 21 election systems that were targeted were not related with vote tabulations . The vote tallies were also not altered by the Russians . Then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch said no “ technical interference ” occurred on election night , and DHS did not detect any spikes in malicious cyber activity that would have suggested an attack that night either . It was an interference game mostly grounded in the peddling of fake news by state-funded media outlets and social media trolls—and those fake news stories played no pivotal role in the election . Just like with Ukraine , Obama virtually did nothing with Russia , a nation that supposedly was no longer a threat and relic of the Cold War era . Now , borderline Russophobia permeates the Democratic Party .
Also , before we draw conclusions regarding Russia , Putin , and the interference campaign , it was only the Director of National Intelligence , the FBI , the CIA , and the NSA who said they had high confidence that Putin ordered this interference campaign . It was n't all 17 intelligence agencies , which is something The New York Times had to clear up .","President Barack Obama fumbled the ball on responding to Russian meddling during the 2016 election.

Adam Schiff (D-CA), the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, mentioned last week that the Obama administration could have done more. On CNN’s GPS with Fareed Zakaria, co-chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA), said that President Obama “choked” on Russia.





“Do you think that the Obama administration choked and should have done more when they knew the Russians were interfering [in the 2016 election]?” asked Zakaria.

“With the value of hindsight, yes,” replied Warner.

Yet, the Virginia Democrat tried to offer some cover, saying that there were many threads of information coming in and no one seemed to have been able to put them together. Really? The Washington Post’s bombshell article reported that the Obama White House knew as soon as August of 2016 that Russia was interfering, and that they feared what the Russians might do if they responded. Hence, the bunker mentality, coupled with a weak post-election response, which amounted to a slap on wrist, according to former acting CIA Director Michael Morrell. He told CBS’s Face The Nation on June 25 that the Obama administration actually did a decent job coordinating with other states to shore up security efforts with their voting systems. Yet, he noted the response to all of this was an abject failure and did nothing to deter the Russians from engaging in other interference activities in the future [emphasis mine]:

I think they get a high grade, because I think they prevented this from being worse than it would have been otherwise. That's first thing.



The second thing is the decision not to share fully with the American people what was happening. So, the Obama administration did not tell the American people that Putin was behind this and did not tell the American people what Putin was trying to do, hurt Hillary Clinton, support Donald Trump. That's a big, big decision.



You know, the White House, I think, was exactly where David [Ignatius of The Washington Post, another guest] said they were, which is they didn't want to make this worse. But by not entering the playing field, they ceded it to Vladimir Putin. So, I give them a C on that, and I think historians are going to debate this for a long time.



The third issue is how to deter the Russians in the future from doing this again, and here I think they failed miserably. I give them an F, because the package they put together, the kicking the diplomats out, intelligence officers out, closing down a couple of compounds, putting limited sanctions on in no way -- it was a slap on the wrist to Vladimir Putin. He sees it that way. It will not deter him in the future.

Was this an election hack? No. The 21 election systems that were targeted were not related with vote tabulations. The vote tallies were also not altered by the Russians. Then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch said no “technical interference” occurred on election night, and DHS did not detect any spikes in malicious cyber activity that would have suggested an attack that night either. It was an interference game mostly grounded in the peddling of fake news by state-funded media outlets and social media trolls—and those fake news stories played no pivotal role in the election. Just like with Ukraine, Obama virtually did nothing with Russia, a nation that supposedly was no longer a threat and relic of the Cold War era. Now, borderline Russophobia permeates the Democratic Party.

Also, before we draw conclusions regarding Russia, Putin, and the interference campaign, it was only the Director of National Intelligence, the FBI, the CIA, and the NSA who said they had high confidence that Putin ordered this interference campaign. It wasn't all 17 intelligence agencies, which is something The New York Times had to clear up.",www.townhall.com,right,IwxWskzNbZ9bz5vI

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump sought to walk back his remarks with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday by correcting a single word uttered during the 46-minute joint appearance in Helsinki.

When Trump said he couldn't see any reason why Russia ""would"" have been involved in the U.S. presidential election what he meant to say was ""wouldn't.""

""I said the word 'would' instead of 'wouldn't,'"" Trump explained, speaking at the White House more than 24 hours after his news conference with Putin began drawing fire from allies and critics alike. ""The sentence should have been, 'I don't see any reason why it wouldn't be Russia.'""

""I think that probably clarifies things pretty good by itself,"" Trump said.

Critics were quick to suggest the context around the president's quote indicates he said what he meant the first time. Before he used the word, Trump said he had heard from his director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, that Russia meddled in the 2016 election but that he had also heard a strong denial from Putin.

Putin ""just said it’s not Russia,"" Trump said at the news conference.

""I will say this: I don’t see any reason why it would be, but I really do want to see the server,"" the president said, shifting his answer to a long-running complaint that the FBI did not adequately investigate the hacking of the Democratic National Committee.

Yet it's not clear that even if Trump had meant to say ""wouldn't"" instead of ""would"" that he could have avoided the sharp backlash from members of both parties that began to mount as Air Force One carried him back to Washington on Monday night.

Here's a look at some of the other remarks that critics found controversial:

Powerful denial

Shortly after the sentence Trump says he has now corrected, the president appeared to place a heavy emphasis on Putin's denial of Russian meddling. Putin has always denied involvement in the election, long before U.S. intelligence concluded Moscow was working to sway voters in Trump’s favor.

""So I have great confidence in my intelligence people,"" Trump said, ""but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today.""

U.S. to blame

Much of the negative reaction from Republicans to Trump's remarks has come from lawmakers concerned that the president appeared to blame U.S. actions equally with Russia's to explain the touchy relationship between the two countries...

...Despite the fact that Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and launched massive influence campaigns in the U.S.and other countries.

""I hold both countries responsible. I think that the United States has been foolish. I think we’ve all been foolish. We should have had this dialogue a long time ago — a long time, frankly, before I got to office,"" Trump said. ""And I think we’re all to blame.""

Russia probe 'ridiculous'

Days after the Justice Department indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers it said were involved in interfering in the election, Trump repeatedly dismissed the ongoing probe by special counsel Robert Mueller — arguing the investigation was partly to blame for frosty relations with Moscow.

""And it has had a negative impact upon the relationship of the two largest nuclear powers in the world,"" Trump said. ""We have 90 percent of nuclear power between the two countries. It’s ridiculous. It’s ridiculous what’s going on with the probe.""

Words not said

Reporters asked Trump specifically whether he holds Russia accountable for troubled relations between the two countries, prompting the president to launch into a discussion about the Mueller probe and denying collusion with Moscow.

Trump did not mention the 2014 annexation of Crimea, British allegations Russia poisoned a former Soviet spy on its soil, election influence campaigns in other countries or questions about the Russian role in the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in 2014.

Putin said Trump raised the issue of Crimea in their private meetings, saying that he “continued to maintain that it was illegal to annex it.” Trump never mentioned the issue publicly.

Better relationship?

Trump claimed the summit had already led to a stronger relationship between Washington and Moscow, which he described as a central goal heading into the meeting,

President Donald Trump has invited Russian leader Vladimir Putin to visit the US, in a move that drew startled laughter from a US intelligence chief.

""That's going to be special!"" said Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, when he was told about the invitation during a live interview.

The political fallout is continuing from Mr Trump's first summit with Mr Putin in Finland on Monday.

Democrats are demanding the notes from the two leaders' private talks.

Trump prepares a sequel

By Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington

Donald Trump has tweeted that the summit with Mr Putin was a ""great success"" and people at ""higher ends of intelligence"" loved his Helsinki news conference. As if to underline that point, plans are already under way for a sequel - this time in Washington DC.

Never mind that the White House has spent three days trying to clean up the political fallout from the summit amid bipartisan criticism, or that the special counsel investigation into Russian meddling in 2016 continues apace.

Mr Trump may have been encouraged by recent opinion polling showing that while the public at large is uneasy with Mr Trump's Russia policies, his Republican base - by a sizeable majority - is fine with his performance.

The president campaigned on closer ties with Russia, a goal that had been thwarted during his first year in office. With his base still behind him, Mr Trump appears ready to press on with his efforts.

What do we know of the plan for a Putin visit?

On Thursday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders tweeted that discussions about a visit by Mr Putin to Washington DC this autumn were already under way.

Russia's ambassador to Washington, Anatoly Antonov, could not confirm whether an invitation had already been issued.

He told the BBC: ""The problem is there's so much talk today, so much fake news, so much distortion, about what happened at this summit.

""Such negativity for some reason - I don't understand why the Western media think it's bad that two presidents are meeting. What's bad about it?""

Has US intelligence chief 'gone rogue'?

The announcement of a second summit appeared to come as a surprise to Mr Trump's director of national intelligence.

""Say that again,"" Mr Coats said when an NBC News presenter broke the news to him during a live interview at the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado.

He said he did not yet know what Mr Trump and Mr Putin had discussed during their meeting, at which only the pair and their interpreters were present.

The White House is said to be furious about the director of national intelligence's remarks.

""Coats has gone rogue,"" one senior official told the Washington Post.

What was Putin's 'incredible offer'?

At the post-summit news conference in Helsinki, Mr Putin offered access to 12 Russians indicted in absentia by the US authorities for allegedly hacking Democratic Party computers, on condition Moscow authorities could question 12 Americans over other matters.

Mr Trump first praised the suggestion as an ""incredible offer"", but White House press secretary Sarah Sanders later said the president disagreed with it.

No extradition treaty exists between the two countries.

Mr Putin singled out US-born financier Bill Browder, accusing him of massive tax fraud, which he denies.

Mr Browder was instrumental in the US imposing sanctions in 2012 on top Russian officials accused of corruption in the Magnitsky affair.

""I'm thankful that Donald Trump has no intention of handing me over to Vladimir Putin to have me killed in a Russian prison,"" Mr Browder told the BBC on Thursday.

One of the other Americans on Russia's list was a former US ambassador to Moscow, Michael McFaul.

A perfect fit for Kremlin

By Vitaliy Shevchenko, BBC Monitoring

Donald Trump's apparent U-turn may have come as a shock to some, but not to Russia. It fits perfectly the Kremlin's media narrative: the US president genuinely wants to mend ties with Russia, but is facing fierce opposition from the political mainstream.

""The deep state has literally leapt into action after the Helsinki summit,"" says official TV channel Rossiya 1.

According to state-run Channel One, Trump has become ""the target of persecution with a vengeance"" in the US, and therefore had to reverse his remarks on alleged Russian meddling.

Gazprom's NTV uses an old Russian saying about a man trying to catch a bird that has flown. The implication is clear: you said Russia never meddled, and it is too late to change that now.

And St Petersburg-based Channel Five wonders: ""Is Trump under hypnosis?""

Ambassador controversy

The White House is facing further criticism for not ruling out a Russian proposal to question US citizens accused by the Kremlin of ""illegal activities"".

One of those being sought by Russia is former US ambassador to Moscow Michael McFaul, but allowing him to be questioned would breach the legal immunity normally granted to a country's foreign service.

Politicians from both sides of the US political divide have rubbished the idea - one Democrat congressman called the suggestion ""crazy"".

FBI director Christopher Wray also dismissed it, saying ""it's certainly not high on our list of investigative techniques"".

Democrats demand interpreter

Democrats want a subpoena issued for the notes of a state department translator who accompanied Mr Trump to his two-hour meeting with Mr Putin.

The two leaders met privately at the summit with only their interpreters present.

But there is little Democrats can do in the Republican-controlled Congress. On Thursday, California representative Adam Schiff said his proposal to legally demand the translator's notes was rejected.

Meanwhile, a non-binding Senate resolution introduced by Jeff Flake, a Republican, and Chris Coons, a Democrat, was blocked, too.

House Democrats are touting a bill to ""hold Russia accountable, strengthen our election security and bolster our alliances"", but it is likely to face strong headwinds.

What has President Trump said?

Much of the outrage stemmed from one comment Mr Trump made when he appeared alongside Mr Putin on Monday.

During a news conference, Mr Trump was asked whether he believed US intelligence agencies' conclusions or Mr Putin about whether Russia had meddled.

According to a White House transcript, he said: ""I will say this: I don't see any reason why it would be.""

Amid outcry, the following day he said he had misspoken.

speaker Does that seem right ? michael schmidt Yep . speaker O.K .
Dean Baquet , our executive editor , calls down to Washington to ask Elisabeth Bumiller , our bureau chief , what do you know ?
elisabeth bumiller You ’ re not so sure about it ? michael schmidt I ’ m less sure about the timing , but —
Elizabeth calls me over to her desk , puts him on speakerphone . Mikey , what do you know ?
dean baquet Do you know much of a heads-up we may or may not get ? michael schmidt My guess is not a lot because I don ’ t know what there is to get a heads-up on .
dean baquet O.K . elisabeth bumiller That ’ s what we got . michael schmidt So that ’ s all we got . elisabeth bumiller And we have stories ready . Once we get the word from Justice , we just push a button . michael schmidt All the work is done . elisabeth bumiller We ’ re just tourists hanging around . michael schmidt We ’ re sort of lemmings at this point .
So it ’ s sort of just having the same unsatisfying conversation with different people throughout the office for several hours while eating doughnuts .
archived recording The special counsel investigation is over . Special Counsel Robert Mueller has concluded his investigation into Russian election interference and possible coordination with associates of President Donald Trump . That report has been submitted . Now the question is , what happens to it ? How much gets released and when ? That is up to the new attorney general , Bill Barr .
So what do we know at this stage ? It is Friday afternoon . What ’ s our understanding ?
Our understanding is that the attorney general and his deputies now have a long weekend of reading ahead of them . They have to go through the report , see what ’ s there , digest it , and then figure out what to do with it . How much of it should be made public , how much of it should be given to Congress , and how much of it should remain secret .
Is that really all we know at this point ? Is there anything about how this unfolded that tells us anything about the report or what Mueller has found , if he ’ s decided to bring any charges against any figure in the White House , or how he ’ s thinking about this ?
We just know that Mueller is done . There are no more individuals that will be charged by the special counsel ’ s office in the investigation . If anyone else has gotten caught up in this , they will be indicted by other U.S. attorneys across the country who have absorbed investigations from the special counsel ’ s office .
So the version of the report that will go to Congress and be seen by the public is the version that the attorney general has had a chance to go through and decide which parts should be seen by the larger world and which should not . And that ’ s still going to take a while for him to figure out .
Correct . And it ’ s a very difficult process , because if there is criminality in regards to the president , it ’ s a very tricky issue to navigate . The Justice Department has a policy that says the president can ’ t be indicted . But if the president can ’ t be indicted , Congress should deal with that behavior . How do you give that information to Congress ? It ’ s not a snap decision you can make — like , O.K. , Mueller ’ s done , this is what he found . Let ’ s put this in another box and send it to Congress . It ’ s far trickier .
So how does the A.G. make the decision about what to include and what not to include in this report ?
Barr is in this incredibly difficult spot , because he has to figure out how much information to share with the public and Congress in a way that is enough to leave people convinced that this investigation was done thoroughly and based on following the facts . But he has to protect the president from disclosures about him that the public may be interested in , that his political enemies may want to know , but that has no bearing on the actual criminal investigation that was done .
And does how the attorney general handles that balance depend , in your mind , Mike , on what the report from Mueller finds and says and recommends ?
Yes . If Mueller says the president didn ’ t break the law , then Barr has to figure out how much information to give to Congress so that Congress takes those findings seriously . The problem is Barr is in a very difficult spot politically , because the Democrats have already concluded the president did something wrong . So if Barr learns from Mueller that there ’ s no criminality on the president , how does Barr then win over those Democrats and show them that Mueller truly made a decision based on the facts ? How much of what the investigation found does he have to give to the Hill ? In a normal criminal investigation , all of that information would not become public because the Justice Department would want to protect the individual who they have found did not commit a crime . But this situation is different , because a lot of people do think the president committed a crime . So how do you show the Democrats and the rest of the country that hey , look , this is what Mueller found . He only found X , Y , and Z . And if we wanted to make a case , he would have needed to have uncovered these other things , which he did not . And that ’ s why we ’ re confident with his findings .
And on the other hand , if Mueller does find criminality and perhaps recommend charges against the president , how does Barr have to proceed ?
Well , how much of the evidence that Mueller uncovered should go to Congress ? What should be told to Congress ? Should Congress be told explicitly , look , Mueller believes the president violated these laws , and here ’ s the evidence to back it up ? But what if some of that evidence has been obtained from a grand jury ? The Justice Department can ’ t just hand over grand jury information to Congress . What if the information is classified ? They ’ re not going to want to hand over classified information to Congress . They think Congress leaks like a sieve .
Is it safe to say though , Mike , that if criminality is found by Mueller , Congress and the public will see more of the Muller report than if that is not found ?
Maybe . Maybe . But look , this is a highly unusual situation . The person who runs the executive branch , the president , has just been under investigation by folks inside of his own branch for the past 22 months . Very awkward situation .
And the person making the decision about what we all will learn about that investigation is a direct appointee of that president .
Correct . Has the job because the president put him there . So the perception here is one where the average person looks at this and says , well , how can a guy who was made attorney general by the president look at this situation and make a decision that is free of politics ? And how can I have confidence that this was done based on the facts ?
So when will we know more ? When will we know what the attorney general has decided on that front ?
When will we know more ? Barr and his deputies will go through this , and I don ’ t know — sometime in the next few days , sometime in the next few weeks . It may be a difficult process to unbraid . Mueller has been rummaging around the president ’ s life for 22 months . We don ’ t have clarity into everything Mueller ’ s found . What if Barr looks at it and says , eh , Mueller thinks he violated this law and that law . But actually , I don ’ t think he has it . Maybe there ’ s not enough there . Maybe Barr disagrees with what Mueller has found , simply on a legal basis . The other thing is that Barr only really gets one shot to get it right . Whatever he goes out the door with in terms of handing over information to Congress , he ’ s got to have it right . He ’ s not going to have a second chance to say , well , you know , I gave you that stuff . But like , meh , maybe it ’ s not what I thought it was . Or , oh , let ’ s give you more . He has to get it right the first time . Otherwise , he ’ ll look like he ’ s waffling .
And how much of how Barr handles this will be with a mind toward the expectation that a Democratically controlled House of Representatives is already into a series of investigations that they only want to redouble once this report is in their hands ?
Barr clearly knows Congress is going to jump up and down until it is satisfied with the information that it wants about this investigation . He can drag that out and probably lose it one way or another , either in the court of public opinion or in the actual courts . So he probably just wants to get it over with as soon as possible . He knows this has been an enormous weight on the country , and that the sooner it is resolved , the sooner the country can move on .
And Mike , what is the likelihood that the way we find out more about the Mueller report is not from the version that ’ s sent to Congress , but from something else ? I think we ’ re all really mindful of the fact that this is the era of the leak , and that this is the biggest potential leak in recent memory .
I don ’ t know . I mean , the number of people who will have access to this document will be very small . And they will know that if there are a lot of leaks about this , then the president can start to raise questions about what ’ s really going on . It will look nefarious . The Democrats will get their backs up and say , well , if this stuff is leaking out , why can ’ t we have access to it ? They will know that their lives will be much more difficult if there are leaks here . Obviously , you could come up with a scenario where someone working on the investigation is frustrated that the Justice Department has decided to go one way or the other on the report , and they think , ah , screw it , I ’ m going to make this public . But my guess is they have gone to great lengths to ensure that this is heavily protected .","michael barbaro

So it’s here.

michael schmidt

Well, it’s in the hands of Bill Barr. It’s not here in the sense that we can publicly consume it and see what Bob Mueller found. It has just moved from one pocket, which we can’t see into, into another pocket that we can’t see into.

michael barbaro

But it has moved pockets, at least, which is something. Something we’ve been waiting two years for.

michael schmidt

Correct. Bob Mueller is done with his investigation.

michael barbaro

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is a special episode of “The Daily.” Today: The Mueller report has been sent to the attorney general. It’s Friday afternoon, March 22. So Mike, talk me through your day today.

michael schmidt

So knowing it was going to be a big day, I turned on the recorder as soon as I left the house this morning and made my way into the office to hurry up and wait.

[music]

michael schmidt All right. 10:05 a.m.

michael schmidt

I left my house at 10:00 a.m.

michael schmidt We expect the report to be finished today around noon.

michael schmidt

Walking down 17th Street, heading to the office.

michael schmidt I got a call from the office from my editor wanting to know what I knew. Told her I knew nothing. Last thing an editor wants to hear — nothing new.

michael schmidt

Not a ton of people on the streets.

speaker Excuse me. michael schmidt Yes? speaker Do you know where the Jamaican Embassy is? michael schmidt I do not, I’m sorry. Do you know what the address is?

michael schmidt

Was stopped by a woman who couldn’t find the Jamaican embassy.

michael schmidt O.K., so you’re going to want to go this way. Go to DuPont Circle, and make a right. Just keep on following that trail. speaker Oh, O.K., so I’m going the wrong way. michael schmidt Well, we’re all going the wrong way.

michael schmidt

Come up to Massachusetts Avenue.

michael schmidt Cold March day. Fairly cold here in Washington. 45 degrees.

michael schmidt

Just had a normal sort of walk into the office.

michael schmidt [HUMMING] Half a block away, coming up to 17th —

michael barbaro

It doesn’t seem like you’re in a big hurry to get to the office.

michael schmidt

Well, all the work has been done. We know what’s coming.

michael schmidt How are you? speaker Hey, Mike. michael schmidt What’s going on?

michael schmidt

So come into the building.

michael schmidt Big day? No? Not a big day? All right.

michael schmidt

Get on the elevator.

elevator voice announcer Floor seven.

michael schmidt

Walk into the office. And everyone wants to know —

speaker 1 What do you got? What do you got? speaker 2 Chasing the report.

michael schmidt

When’s it going to happen?

speaker This is the question I ask him every five — michael schmidt Days or — speaker Days or weeks. michael schmidt Days or weeks?

michael schmidt

The whole apparatus of The New York Times is jacked up for this moment.

michael schmidt We got Nick here. We’re all ready. speaker Gang’s all here.

michael schmidt

There’s been a lot of time and planning that’s gone into this. There’s a lot of stories that have been written that are ready to go.

speaker Does that seem right? michael schmidt Yep. speaker O.K.

michael schmidt

Everyone’s sitting around waiting, and they want answers.

dean baquet So what’s the latest?

michael schmidt

Dean Baquet, our executive editor, calls down to Washington to ask Elisabeth Bumiller, our bureau chief, what do you know?

elisabeth bumiller You’re not so sure about it? michael schmidt I’m less sure about the timing, but —

michael schmidt

Elizabeth calls me over to her desk, puts him on speakerphone. Mikey, what do you know?

dean baquet Do you know much of a heads-up we may or may not get? michael schmidt My guess is not a lot because I don’t know what there is to get a heads-up on.

michael schmidt

And I said, I don’t know.

michael barbaro

[LAUGHS] You tell them that you don’t know.

michael schmidt

We don’t know!

dean baquet O.K. elisabeth bumiller That’s what we got. michael schmidt So that’s all we got. elisabeth bumiller And we have stories ready. Once we get the word from Justice, we just push a button. michael schmidt All the work is done. elisabeth bumiller We’re just tourists hanging around. michael schmidt We’re sort of lemmings at this point.

michael schmidt

So it’s sort of just having the same unsatisfying conversation with different people throughout the office for several hours while eating doughnuts.

michael barbaro

[LAUGHS]

michael schmidt

And then it happens.

archived recording The special counsel investigation is over. Special Counsel Robert Mueller has concluded his investigation into Russian election interference and possible coordination with associates of President Donald Trump. That report has been submitted. Now the question is, what happens to it? How much gets released and when? That is up to the new attorney general, Bill Barr.

michael barbaro

So what do we know at this stage? It is Friday afternoon. What’s our understanding?

michael schmidt

Our understanding is that the attorney general and his deputies now have a long weekend of reading ahead of them. They have to go through the report, see what’s there, digest it, and then figure out what to do with it. How much of it should be made public, how much of it should be given to Congress, and how much of it should remain secret.

michael barbaro

Is that really all we know at this point? Is there anything about how this unfolded that tells us anything about the report or what Mueller has found, if he’s decided to bring any charges against any figure in the White House, or how he’s thinking about this?

michael schmidt

We just know that Mueller is done. There are no more individuals that will be charged by the special counsel’s office in the investigation. If anyone else has gotten caught up in this, they will be indicted by other U.S. attorneys across the country who have absorbed investigations from the special counsel’s office.

michael barbaro

So the version of the report that will go to Congress and be seen by the public is the version that the attorney general has had a chance to go through and decide which parts should be seen by the larger world and which should not. And that’s still going to take a while for him to figure out.

michael schmidt

michael schmidt

Oh, now you want to know more.

michael barbaro

[LAUGHS] Yes, please.

michael schmidt

The greed of the news business.

michael barbaro

If you’ll indulge us.

michael schmidt

When will we know more? Barr and his deputies will go through this, and I don’t know — sometime in the next few days, sometime in the next few weeks. It may be a difficult process to unbraid.

michael schmidt

Yeah.

michael barbaro

Will it leak?

michael schmidt

I don’t know. I mean, the number of people who will have access to this document will be very small. And they will know that if there are a lot of leaks about this, then the president can start to raise questions about what’s really going on. It will look nefarious.

Six Democratic committee chairs , led by Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler , sent a letter to Barr on Friday arguing that the public should be given a chance to view Mueller 's report `` without delay and to the maximum extent permitted by law . ''
`` After nearly two years of investigation — accompanied by two years of direct attacks on the integrity of the investigation by the President — the public is entitled to know what the Special Counsel has found , '' the lawmakers wrote .
When Mueller 's investigation is completed , he is required to submit a confidential report to the attorney general , detailing the decisions that were made to prosecute or not prosecute those who were investigated . Justice Department officials are preparing for Mueller 's report soon , although a Justice Department official said Friday that Mueller 's report is not expected next week .
Once Mueller submits his report , it 's up to Barr to decide what to provide to Congress and to the public .
At his confirmation hearing , Barr said he wanted to be as transparent as he could with Mueller 's report , but left himself wiggle room by saying he would have to follow Justice Department regulations .
Democrats are unlikely to be satisfied with a summary from Barr detailing Mueller 's findings . Several key Democrats have already signaled they could subpoena the Justice Department to obtain Mueller 's report or the underlying evidence that he gathered , though Friday 's letter does not mention the prospect of a subpoena or court fight .
`` A summary written by Attorney General Barr in place of the Mueller report will not be acceptable , '' said California Sen. Dianne Feinstein , the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee , in a statement Friday . `` This is n't limited to a question of whether crimes have been committed . Congress must also determine if there was misconduct or abuse of power . ''

russia,Fox Online News,2,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/during-seminal-michael-cohen-hearing-the-insiders-became-outsiders,"During seminal Michael Cohen hearing, the insiders became outsiders",,Chad Pergram,"Washington is a place known for its “ access. ” Who has the “ inside ” scoop on legislation . A nomination . What ’ s going on at the State Department . The White House .
The nation ’ s capital rewards its insiders . And some outside the Beltway deride the very concept of “ insiders . ”
COHEN LOBS BOMBS AT TRUMP DURING FIERY HEARING , STOPS SHORT OF COLLUSION CLAIM AS GOP BASHES CREDIBILITY
But on Capitol Hill Wednesday , most in the press corps were “ outsiders . ”
There are only so many seats in the House Oversight Committee hearing room in the Rayburn House Office Building . And so when former Trump laywer and fixer Michael Cohen was inside the hearing , most of the press corps was outside .
Lines of TV equipment , cameras , tripods , laptops , equipment bags and microphone cables littered the corridor floors near the hearing room . Although most reporting on the Cohen hearing couldn ’ t get into the room – or needed to remain outside the room so they could go live on the air – they did the next , best thing . They stood in hallway by the hearing room and streamed the session on their phones and computers , even though the marquee event unfolded just a few feet away and through a couple of layers of plaster .
The Cohen hearing will likely establish itself as one of the seminal events of the 116th Congress . That ’ s why the Capitol flooded with reporters and scribes who rarely cover the place . Yet if reporters really wanted to be “ inside ” somewhere and not loitering in a hallway , all they had to to do was saunter down the corridor to the House Financial Services Committee . In that conclave , Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell delivered testimony on monetary policy . Or they could have walked a few steps the other direction for a markup session on school infrastructure legislation before the House Education and Workforce Committee . Maybe stroll next door to the Longworth House Office Building to hear U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer discuss trade with China .
To be fair , there were lots reporters in all of those forums .
So , to be an insider on the Cohen story , you had to be an outsider .
This is just the way things unfold sometimes when you ’ re reporting on Capitol Hill . Sometimes everyone is in the room . Sometimes you ’ re not .
With so many scribes standing in the corridor near the Cohen hearing , it ’ s not surprising people may have missed other things unfolding Wednesday on Capitol Hill .
Reps. Pramila Jayapal , D-Wash. , and Debbie Dingell , D-Mich. , introduced their “ Medicare for All Act ” at a press conference about an hour into the Cohen hearing .
Some liberals criticized the timing of the rollout , virtually buried by the Cohen hearing . Moderate Democrats who are wary of Medicare For All , applauded the timing . They appreciated that the Cohen hearing buried the rollout .
On the House floor , lawmakers approved the first major piece of legislation on firearms in a quarter century . The House voted 240 to 190 to require universal background checks for the purchase of guns . Some watching the Cohen coverage may have seen that debate and vote . House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings ( D-MD ) recessed the Cohen hearing for nearly two hours so lawmakers could head to the floor to vote on the gun measure .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif. , was an outsider as well . The California Democrat spent part of the day speaking at a forum a few miles north of the Capitol at Howard University .

Washington is a place known for its “access.” Who has the “inside” scoop on legislation. A nomination. What’s going on at the State Department. The White House.

The nation’s capital rewards its insiders. And some outside the Beltway deride the very concept of “insiders.”

COHEN LOBS BOMBS AT TRUMP DURING FIERY HEARING, STOPS SHORT OF COLLUSION CLAIM AS GOP BASHES CREDIBILITY

But on Capitol Hill Wednesday, most in the press corps were “outsiders.”

It’s an issue of space.



There are only so many seats in the House Oversight Committee hearing room in the Rayburn House Office Building. And so when former Trump laywer and fixer Michael Cohen was inside the hearing, most of the press corps was outside.

Lines of TV equipment, cameras, tripods, laptops, equipment bags and microphone cables littered the corridor floors near the hearing room. Although most reporting on the Cohen hearing couldn’t get into the room – or needed to remain outside the room so they could go live on the air – they did the next, best thing. They stood in hallway by the hearing room and streamed the session on their phones and computers, even though the marquee event unfolded just a few feet away and through a couple of layers of plaster.

The Cohen hearing will likely establish itself as one of the seminal events of the 116th Congress. That’s why the Capitol flooded with reporters and scribes who rarely cover the place. Yet if reporters really wanted to be “inside” somewhere and not loitering in a hallway, all they had to to do was saunter down the corridor to the House Financial Services Committee. In that conclave, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell delivered testimony on monetary policy. Or they could have walked a few steps the other direction for a markup session on school infrastructure legislation before the House Education and Workforce Committee. Maybe stroll next door to the Longworth House Office Building to hear U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer discuss trade with China.

To be fair, there were lots reporters in all of those forums.

But none of those hearings involved Michael Cohen.

So, to be an insider on the Cohen story, you had to be an outsider.

This is just the way things unfold sometimes when you’re reporting on Capitol Hill. Sometimes everyone is in the room. Sometimes you’re not.

With so many scribes standing in the corridor near the Cohen hearing, it’s not surprising people may have missed other things unfolding Wednesday on Capitol Hill.

Reps. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., and Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., introduced their “Medicare for All Act” at a press conference about an hour into the Cohen hearing.

Some liberals criticized the timing of the rollout, virtually buried by the Cohen hearing. Moderate Democrats who are wary of Medicare For All, applauded the timing. They appreciated that the Cohen hearing buried the rollout.

On the House floor, lawmakers approved the first major piece of legislation on firearms in a quarter century. The House voted 240 to 190 to require universal background checks for the purchase of guns. Some watching the Cohen coverage may have seen that debate and vote. House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-MD) recessed the Cohen hearing for nearly two hours so lawmakers could head to the floor to vote on the gun measure.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was an outsider as well. The California Democrat spent part of the day speaking at a forum a few miles north of the Capitol at Howard University. Pelosi returned to Capitol Hill for the gun vote. When asked about the Cohen confab, Pelosi said, “I didn’t see one word of the hearing.” She added that what concerned her more than Cohen were “the bad policies of Donald Trump.”

But by nightfall, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) was fundraising off the Cohen hearing – in Pelosi’s name. The DCCC emailed a fundraising pitch to supporters from “Nancy Pelosi” late Wednesday.

“What we witnessed today should alarm us all,” read the missive, sent on behalf of Pelosi. “And it should light a fire under us to work to get to the truth of the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia.”

Cohen returned to Capitol Hill Thursday for yet another all-day session – his third this week.

That day , a pair of FBI agents came to question Trump ’ s top national security aide , Mike Flynn , about his dealings with the Russian government . Flynn gave the agents a tour of his new spot in the new administration , interrupted at one point as Trump and some movers walked past discussing where to hang art on the walls . Then Flynn took them back to his corner office and calmly lied to them about conversations with Russia ’ s ambassador .
Flynn , agents later wrote , “ did not parse his words or hesitate. ” He simply lied .
The exchange was the start of a remarkable succession of lies over nearly two years by some of Trump ’ s closest political associates , told to federal agents , Congress and the public that distanced the president and his campaign from an investigation into whether his campaign participated in Russian efforts to disrupt the election that put him in office .
Whatever else special counsel Robert Mueller ’ s now-concluded investigation may reveal , it has devoted considerable attention to the Trump associates whose lies to lawmakers and investigators deflected attention from connections between Russia and the president ’ s campaign , and to a central question hanging over many of the charges Mueller has filed : Why did they lie ?
Mueller delivered his final report Friday to Attorney General William Barr , marking the end of an investigation that has loomed over the first two years of Trump 's presidency . The Justice Department has so far revealed none of the report 's conclusions , but over the past year and a half , prosecutors have sketched some of them in hundreds of pages of court filings .
Prosecutors have revealed that Trump ’ s campaign worked eagerly to benefit from a Russian intelligence operation that hacked his opponents ’ emails and echoed them in phony social media campaigns , an effort the U.S. government later concluded was aimed in part at helping to deliver Trump the presidency . And investigators charged that a succession of top aides then lied to pretend they hadn ’ t .
Barr 's Letter : Read Attorney General Barr 's letter to Congress announcing end of Mueller 's Russia probe
Investigation Ends : Special counsel Robert Mueller delivers report marking end of investigation into Trump 's campaign , Russia
Mueller ’ s office accused seven people , all but one of them former aides or advisers to Trump , with making dozens of false statements during the Russia investigation .
The investigation has produced a deluge of falsehoods on subjects from the president ’ s business dealings in Moscow to a meeting his son and campaign chief attended in Trump Tower in 2016 with a Russian promising “ dirt ” on his political opponent . But lying to the public is usually not a crime , and Mueller ’ s investigators zeroed in on those directed to lawmakers and federal investigators .
Trump ’ s lawyers maintain that the lies reflect little more than a misguided impulse to protect themselves from things that weren ’ t crimes to begin with . “ The thing about all these lies is that if they all just told the damn truth they probably wouldn ’ t have been in any trouble , ” said Rudy Giuliani , Trump ’ s lead attorney .
Prosecutors haven ’ t hinted at their answer , other than to reveal that it is one of the subjects they investigated .
But some of the people they have accused of lying have supplied answers of their own : One suggested he lied out of loyalty . Others appear to have been protecting the president . One , Michael Cohen , a former executive in Trump ’ s private business and his personal lawyer , said he lied because the president wanted him to .
“ Everybody 's job at the Trump Organization is to protect Mr. Trump . Every day most of us knew we were coming in and we were going to lie for him on something and that became the norm , ” Cohen said in sworn testimony to a House committee Feb. 27 . “ And that 's exactly what 's happening right now in this country and it 's exactly what 's happening here in government . ”
Flynn has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI on Jan. 24 , 2017 , about conversations with Russia ’ s ambassador , including one in which he discussed rolling back sanctions the Obama administration had imposed in response to Moscow ’ s election-meddling .
Three days after that meeting , two FBI agents went looking for a young campaign aide , George Papadopoulos . They took him from his mother ’ s house in Chicago to the bureau ’ s office there , switched on a video camera , and warned him to tell the truth .
“ The only way you ’ re getting in trouble today is if you lie to us , ” one said , according to court records .
For two hours , the agents quizzed Papadopoulos on his interactions with a professor in London named Joseph Mifsud and other people Papadopoulos believed had ties to the Russian government . Eventually , Papadopoulos revealed that Mifsud told him in early 2016 that Moscow had gathered “ dirt ” on Hillary Clinton , in the form of “ thousands of emails , ” months before the government revealed that Russia ’ s military intelligence service had hacked Democratic political organizations . But Papadopoulos passed his encounter with Mifsud off as a “ strange coincidence , ” unrelated to his work for Trump .
He later admitted that wasn ’ t true ; Mifsud approached him because of his role on the campaign .
That August , Michael Cohen lied in a written statement to two congressional committees about Trump ’ s efforts to construct a potentially lucrative high-rise in Moscow , telling them that they ended early in the campaign , when in fact those efforts continued until the point – almost six months later – when Trump had effectively secured the Republican presidential nomination . Cohen also tried to mislead members of Congress into thinking that Trump himself was uninvolved in the project .
A month after that , in September 2017 , prosecutors allege that another Trump confidante , Roger Stone , lied to lawmakers about his efforts to gather information for the campaign about hacked emails that were being released by the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks . Prosecutors said someone in Trump ’ s campaign directed a senior campaign official to get in touch with Stone about any other “ damaging information ” the group might have on Clinton .
When lawmakers summoned one of Stone ’ s associates to testify , Stone suggested he , too , stick to the story , saying in a text message obtained by prosecutors : “ Stonewall it . Plead the fifth . Anything to save the plan ’ … Richard Nixon . ”
Cohen , Flynn and Papadopoulos have pleaded guilty to making false statements . So has Manafort ’ s former deputy Rick Gates , and an attorney who worked with the pair , Alexander Van Der Zwaan . Stone , who has maintained his innocence , is scheduled to go on trial in November on charges of lying to Congress and obstruction of justice .
Late last year , Paul Manafort , the former chairman of Trump ’ s campaign , met with investigators and appeared twice before a grand jury . There , prosecutors alleged in court filings , he lied about his interactions with a business associate in Ukraine who U.S. authorities say is tied to Russian intelligence . Prosecutors say Manafort passed polling data to the foreign associate while running Trump ’ s campaign .
Prosecutors didn ’ t charge Manafort with lying , though a judge concluded that he had . Instead they sought to use his lies against him when he was sentenced for other crimes , including conspiracy and tax and bank fraud related to years of lobbying work he conducted in Ukraine .
The full consequence of all the lies remains to be seen .
The personal legal jeopardy for Trump ’ s associates is playing out in courtrooms from New York to Washington . It ’ s less clear the implications those lies have had on Mueller ’ s effort to understand the scope of the Russian government ’ s intelligence operation around the 2016 election , and how directly it was able to tap into Trump ’ s campaign , if at all .
David Laufman , who ran the Justice Department ’ s counter-intelligence unit from 2014 until early 2018 , declined to comment on the cases Mueller filed , but said the urgency of finding and countering foreign intelligence operations should be obvious .
“ It ’ s essential when a counterintelligence threat is discovered for the FBI and the Justice Department to be able to take appropriate investigative steps to get to the heart of the matter as quickly as possible , ” he said . “ If someone the FBI goes to interview is withholding information from the government , that ’ s a serious matter . ''
Trump has tried repeatedly to discredit Mueller ’ s investigation , savaging it as a political “ witch hunt. ” The FBI has confirmed that it investigated whether the president also tried to obstruct it , and Mueller ’ s office closely scrutinized the false statements of Trump aides .
Both Cohen and Flynn have agreed to cooperate with prosecutors and have provided information about the circumstances in which they lied .
“ The obvious question on the obstruction theory is who , if anyone , is suggesting that they ’ d want to cover it up , ” said Shanlon Wu , a former federal prosecutor who represented Gates until last year .
“ Isn ’ t it a remarkable coincidence — why are they all lying ? ” said Robert Ray , a former independent counsel who investigated President Bill Clinton . “ Politics is one of those spaces where loyalty is prized above most everything , ” Ray said . “ When you look at these cases , it ’ s like everyone understood that — down to the lowest staffer . ”
Flynn has never revealed why he lied , and it ’ s puzzled those who know him .
Giuliani said it was “ stupid perjury , ” because Flynn , the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency and a retired general , should have known the government was monitoring his contacts with Russia ’ s ambassador . Giuliani also said it was “ outrageous ” that agents questioned Flynn without a lawyer and didn ’ t give him a chance to correct his false statements .
Robert “ Rocky ” Kempenaar , one of Flynn ’ s longtime friends from Rhode Island , said he believes he lied to protect the president and his administration and that he did not decide to do it on his own .
“ He ’ s a general , ” Kempenaar said . “ He was following orders from above him . Whether it was the president , I don ’ t know , but I kind of figured it out knowing Michael the way we do . ”
Cohen , too , placed Trump squarely at the center of the obstruction investigation . In scathing testimony to the House Oversight Committee in early February , he said Trump had implicitly encouraged him to lie to lawmakers about plans to build a Trump Tower in Russia . And he testified that some of Trump ’ s lawyers reviewed and edited a false written statement before he delivered it to Congress in 2017 .
“ Mr . Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress , that 's not how he operates , ” Cohen said . “ In conversations we had during the campaign , at the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him , he would look me in the eye and tell me , there 's no Russian business , and then go on to lie to the American people by saying the same thing .
Cohen has not said when or where he had those conversations with Trump , but investigators revealed in warrant applications that they had extensively monitored both his communications and his location .

23 months of Russia lies

russia,BBC News,1,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-49610107,Ukraine and Russia exchange prisoners in landmark deal,,,"Russia and Ukraine have completed a long-awaited exchange of prisoners .
Those freed include 24 Ukrainian sailors and - controversially - a `` person of interest '' over the downing of flight MH17 which killed 298 people .
The swap is hoped to ease tensions between the two neighbours .
Greeting the Ukrainians at the airport , President Volodymyr Zelensky said : `` We have to do all the steps to finish this horrible war . '' Russia said it was glad its citizens had returned home .
Relations between the two countries deteriorated dramatically in 2014 , when Russia annexed Ukraine 's Crimean peninsula and Russian-backed rebels began an insurgency in two regions of eastern Ukraine .
More than 13,000 people have been killed in the conflict in Donetsk and Luhansk regions .
In April , Ukrainians elected a new president . Mr Zelensky said his top priority was to end the conflict .
Russian officials have said progress towards a prisoner release is vital for improving the `` atmosphere surrounding a settlement of the Ukrainian crisis '' .
Negotiations on the extremely sensitive issue were held in complete secrecy , with both Ukrainian and Russian officials stressing that any leaks could derail the swap .
Russia has not yet confirmed the names of the prisoners who have been released by Ukraine . It arranged a low-profile arrival at Moscow 's Vnukovo airport , with initial reunions kept behind closed doors .
In Ukraine , the scene was very different . The prisoners freed by Russia reunited with their relatives on the tarmac at Kiev 's Boryspil airport , surrounded by the press .
The Ukrainian government has since published a list of the 35 prisoners released by Russia .
It includes 24 Ukrainian sailors whom Russia detained off Crimea in November last year .
They were captured along with three naval ships as they attempted to pass through the Kerch Strait , the only route to access to Ukrainian ports on the Sea of Azov . Shots were fired by the Russian navy during the operation , injuring several Ukrainians .
In May an international tribunal ordered Russia to release the sailors and vessels .
Ukrainian film-maker Oleg Sentsov , jailed for 20 years in 2015 for plotting terrorist acts in Crimea in a trial condemned as political by the US and EU , has also arrived home . He was considered Ukraine 's number-one political prisoner in Russia .

Russia and Ukraine have completed a long-awaited exchange of prisoners.

Those freed include 24 Ukrainian sailors and - controversially - a ""person of interest"" over the downing of flight MH17 which killed 298 people.

The swap is hoped to ease tensions between the two neighbours.

Greeting the Ukrainians at the airport, President Volodymyr Zelensky said: ""We have to do all the steps to finish this horrible war."" Russia said it was glad its citizens had returned home.

Relations between the two countries deteriorated dramatically in 2014, when Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula and Russian-backed rebels began an insurgency in two regions of eastern Ukraine.

More than 13,000 people have been killed in the conflict in Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

In April, Ukrainians elected a new president. Mr Zelensky said his top priority was to end the conflict.

Russian officials have said progress towards a prisoner release is vital for improving the ""atmosphere surrounding a settlement of the Ukrainian crisis"".

Negotiations on the extremely sensitive issue were held in complete secrecy, with both Ukrainian and Russian officials stressing that any leaks could derail the swap.

Who was part of the prisoner exchange?

Russia has not yet confirmed the names of the prisoners who have been released by Ukraine. It arranged a low-profile arrival at Moscow's Vnukovo airport, with initial reunions kept behind closed doors.

In Ukraine, the scene was very different. The prisoners freed by Russia reunited with their relatives on the tarmac at Kiev's Boryspil airport, surrounded by the press.

The Ukrainian government has since published a list of the 35 prisoners released by Russia.

It includes 24 Ukrainian sailors whom Russia detained off Crimea in November last year.

They were captured along with three naval ships as they attempted to pass through the Kerch Strait, the only route to access to Ukrainian ports on the Sea of Azov. Shots were fired by the Russian navy during the operation, injuring several Ukrainians.

In May an international tribunal ordered Russia to release the sailors and vessels.

Ukrainian film-maker Oleg Sentsov, jailed for 20 years in 2015 for plotting terrorist acts in Crimea in a trial condemned as political by the US and EU, has also arrived home. He was considered Ukraine's number-one political prisoner in Russia.

Roman Sushchenko, a Ukrainian journalist detained in Moscow in 2016 for what Russia described as ""conducting espionage activities"", was among those freed.

Also on the list are two far-right Ukrainian activists, Mykola Karpyuk and Stanislav Klykh, both arrested in Russia in 2014. They were accused of fighting on the side of Chechen rebels in the first Chechen war in the 1990s and were later jailed.

Russia has not officially confirmed the names of its freed citizens. But the most significant and controversial person Ukraine sent to Russia is Volodymyr Tsemakh, reportedly a commander of air defences for Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine.

Mr Tsemakh, 58, is a ""person of interest"" in the Dutch-led investigation into the 2014 shooting down over Ukraine of Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17, which led to the deaths of all 298 people on board.

Also included is Yevgeny Mefedov, jailed over deadly clashes between pro-Russian groups and Ukrainian nationalists in the Black Sea port of Odessa in 2014.

Russian-Ukrainian journalist Kyrylo Vyshynsky, accused of treason by Ukraine, was also heading home.

Two former Ukrainian army soldiers who Ukraine says defected to Russia during the annexation of Crimea, Maksim Odintsov and Aleksandr Baranov, are also on the list.

Why is Mr Tsemakh's inclusion on the list controversial?

He is believed to have been a commander of air defences at Snizhne in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, one of the Russian-backed rebel areas in eastern Ukraine.

Snizhne is close to where investigators say the missile which shot down the Malaysian Airlines plane in 2014 was fired.

A team of international criminal investigators said in 2016 that the missile had been brought from Russia and fired from a field controlled by Russian-backed separatists.

In a daring operation in June, Ukrainian special forces reportedly smuggled Mr Tsemakh out of rebel-held territory, and he had been due to stand trial in October.

Although he is not a suspect, international prosecutors have said they would like him to remain in Ukraine so they can ask him further questions.

Last week, they urged the authorities in Ukraine not to allow him to travel to Russia.

However, in a court decision on Wednesday he was released from custody.

In a Washington Post column posted late Thursday , Jonathan Winer detailed an extensive exchange of documents with ex-British spy Christopher Steele , a friend of his since 2009 .
He said he shared “ more than 100 of Steele ’ s reports with the Russia experts at the State Department ” over a period of two years . These weren ’ t related to American politics – but he would later share information about the Trump dossier with the top levels of the Obama-era State Department .
Further , Winer said he shared separate Trump-related material passed on by a Clinton contact with Steele – filling in the blanks regarding an exchange that was mentioned earlier this week in a Senate memo .

“ Given that I had not worked with Shearer and knew that he was not a professional intelligence officer , I did not mention or share his notes with anyone at the State Department . I did not expect them to be shared with anyone in the U.S. government , ” wrote Winer , a former U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state and former Libya special envoy . “ But I learned later that Steele did share them -- with the FBI , after the FBI asked him to provide everything he had on allegations relating to Trump , his campaign and Russian interference in U.S. elections . ”

Attorney General William Barr said there would be no obstruction of justice charges against the president stemming from the report by special counsel Robert Mueller , which was released in redacted form on Thursday .
But the threshold for charging the president might have been breached , had staffers not resisted his directives to engage in actions that would have impeded the investigation .
The more-than-400-page report names 10 onetime close aides or other government officials who refused to carry out requests Trump made that may have violated the law .
`` The President 's efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful , but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests , '' Mueller wrote on Page 158 of the report .
Some of the resistance came from people Trump loathed , such as FBI Director James Comey , whom the president would controversially fire ( thus launching Mueller 's investigation in the first place ) . But other close members of his team also rebuffed the president , including his former chief of staff , campaign manager and White House counsel .
Here is a list of those who acted as essentially legal guardrails for the president and may have also kept themselves out of legal peril .
Trump tried to stop the special counsel 's investigation before it began in earnest . On Page 4 of Mueller 's report , he writes that the president tried to get White House counsel Don McGahn to pressure Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to relieve Mueller of his duties :
`` On June 17 , 2017 , the President called McGahn at home and directed him to call the Acting Attorney General and say that the Special Counsel had conflicts of interest and must be removed . McGahn did not carry out the direction , however , deciding that he would resign rather than trigger what he regarded as a potential Saturday Night Massacre . ''
McGahn feared a comparison to President Richard Nixon 's purging of legal officials from the Justice Department during the Watergate scandal .
When the episode was later reported in the press , the president pressured McGahn to deny the reports . `` McGahn refused to back away from what he remembered happening and perceived the President to be testing his mettle , '' the report says .
Sessions had decided in March 2017 to recuse himself from any investigations into ties between Trump 's campaign and Russia because of meetings he had with the Russian ambassador in 2016 .
Trump pressured Sessions to rethink his recusal from the Russia investigation as another one way to gain control over the Mueller probe . On Page 5 , Mueller writes :
In early summer 2017 , the President called Sessions at home and again asked him to reverse his recusal from the Russia investigation . Sessions did not reverse his recusal . In October 2017 , the President met privately with Sessions in the Oval Office and asked him to `` take [ a ] look '' at investigating Clinton . In December 2017 , shortly after Flynn pleaded guilty pursuant to a cooperation agreement , the President met with Sessions in the Oval Office and suggested , according to notes taken by a senior advisor , that if Sessions unrecused and took back supervision of the Russia investigation , he would be a `` hero . '' The President told Sessions , `` I 'm not going to do anything or direct you to do anything . I just want to be treated fairly . '' In response , Sessions volunteered that he had never seen anything `` improper '' on the campaign and told the President there was a `` whole new leadership team '' in place . He did not unrecuse .
Sessions ' decision to recuse himself was seen as the ultimate betrayal by Trump . Although Sessions was the first sitting senator to endorse Trump , the relationship between the two soured as Trump repeatedly bashed and criticized him in public and on social media . Sessions was finally forced out the day after the November 2018 midterms , when Republicans lost control of the House of Representatives .
Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and senior White House official Rick Dearborn
When both McGahn and Sessions would n't follow directives to fire or limit Mueller 's powers , Trump turned to a loyalist who did n't work in the White House , his former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski . According to the report , Trump pressured Lewandowski to ask Sessions to give a speech to walk back his recusal .
Mueller later writes that Trump again pressured Lewandowski a month later when the message had still not been transmitted to Sessions :
One month later , in another private meeting with Lewandowski on July 19 , 2017 , the President asked about the status of his message for Sessions to limit the Special Counsel investigation to future election interference . Lewandowski told the President that the message would be delivered soon . Hours after that meeting , the President publicly criticized Sessions in an interview with the New York Times , and then issued a series of tweets making it clear that Sessions 's job was in jeopardy .
Despite his apparent promise to the president , Lewandowski dragged his feet . Instead , he `` asked senior White House official Rick Dearborn to deliver it to Sessions '' because he `` believed Dearborn would be a better messenger because he had a longstanding relationship with Sessions . '' But `` Dearborn was uncomfortable with the task and did not follow through . ''
Trump continued to fume over Sessions ' continued role as attorney general and hoped to find yet another way to remove him in order to curb Mueller 's investigation . In July 2017 , Trump `` told Priebus that he had to get Sessions to resign immediately '' because `` the country had lost confidence in Sessions and the negative publicity was not tolerable . ''
`` Priebus replied that if they fired Sessions , they would never get a new Attorney General confirmed and that the Department of Justice and Congress would turn their backs on the President , '' Mueller writes , but Trump suggested a recess appointment instead . However , Priebus still saw Trump 's request was problematic , and called McGahn to help stop it . Priebus and McGahn discussed both resigning to stop Trump from firing Sessions . Still , Trump continued to push his then-chief of staff about the directive :
Even though Priebus did not intend to carry out the President 's directive , he told the President he would get Sessions to resign . Later in the day , Priebus called the President and explained that it would be a calamity if Sessions resigned because Priebus expected that Rosenstein and Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand would also resign and the President would be unable to get anyone else confirmed . The President agreed to hold off on demanding Sessions 's resignation until after the Sunday shows the next day , to prevent the shows from focusing on the firing . By the end of that weekend , Priebus recalled that the President relented and agreed not to ask Sessions to resign .
Before Trump had pressured Priebus to fire Sessions , Trump considered defanging the Mueller investigation by having Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand take it over . He reached out to Rob Porter about Brand 's loyalties because he knew her , and `` asked him to sound her out about taking responsibility for the investigation and being Attorney General . '' Trump would bring it up to Porter a few more times , but Porter was unwilling to do so :
Later , the President asked Porter a few times in passing whether he had spoken to Brand , but Porter did not reach out to her because he was uncomfortable with the task . In asking him to reach out to Brand , Porter understood the President to want to find someone to end the Russia investigation or fire the Special Counsel , although the President never said so explicitly . Porter did not contact Brand because he was sensitive to the implications of that action and did not want to be involved in a chain of events associated with an effort to end the investigation or fire the Special Counsel .
Porter would later resign in February 2018 amid allegations over domestic abuse , which he denied .
It was Comey 's firing by Trump that triggered Mueller 's appointment . Comey alleged that Trump had asked the FBI director to go easy on an investigation into his former national security adviser , Michael Flynn , over misleading the FBI and Vice President Pence about his contact with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak . Trump denied asking Comey about the Flynn matter , but Mueller finds that `` substantial evidence corroborates Comey 's account . ''
When the President met with Comey the day after Flynn 's termination — shortly after being told by [ New Jersey Gov . Chris ] Christie that firing Flynn would not end the Russia investigation — the President cleared the room , even excluding the Attorney General , so that he could again speak to Comey alone . The President 's decision to meet one-on-one with Comey contravened the advice of the White House Counsel that the President should not communicate directly with the Department of Justice to avoid any appearance of interfering in law enforcement activities . And the President later denied that he cleared the room and asked Comey to `` let Flynn go '' — a denial that would have been unnecessary if he believed his request was a proper exercise of prosecutorial discretion .
One reason Trump was sensitive about any investigation into Russian influence is that he thought , Mueller says , any suggestion Russia had intervened in the 2016 election on his behalf would undermine the legitimacy of his presidency .
McFarland was Flynn 's deputy for the brief time he was national security adviser . Trump asked Priebus to have McFarland `` draft an internal email that would confirm that the President did not direct Flynn to call the Russian Ambassador about sanctions . Priebus said he told the President he would only direct McFarland to write such a letter if she were comfortable with it . ''
But McFarland did n't know if that were the case , and she worried it would look like a quid pro quo in order for an ambassadorship to Singapore she was being considered for . Mueller goes on to write :
The evidence does not establish that the President was trying to have McFarland lie . The President 's request , however , was sufficiently irregular that McFarland — who did not know the full extent of Flynn 's communications with the President and thus could not make the representation the President wanted — felt the need to draft an internal memorandum documenting the President 's request ...
When Trump was trying to make a case for firing Comey , he turned to Sessions and Rosenstein for their recommendations . Rosenstein expressed concern over Comey 's handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton 's email server at the State Department , but Trump told him :
... to include in his recommendation the fact that Comey had refused to confirm that the President was not personally under investigation . According to notes taken by a senior DOJ official of Rosenstein 's description of his meeting with the President , the President said , 'Put the Russia stuff in the memo . ' Rosenstein responded that the Russia investigation was not the basis of his recommendation , so he did not think Russia should be mentioned . The President told Rosenstein he would appreciate it if Rosenstein put it in his letter anyway . When Rosenstein left the meeting , he knew that Comey would be terminated , and he told DOJ colleagues that his own reasons for replacing Comey were 'not [ the President 's ] reasons . '
When press coverage turned against Trump following Comey 's firing , the White House called the Department of Justice and said they :
... wanted to put out a statement saying that it was Rosenstein 's idea to fire Comey . Rosenstein told other DOJ officials that he would not participate in putting out a 'false story . ' The President then called Rosenstein directly and said he was watching Fox News , that the coverage had been great , and that he wanted Rosenstein to do a press conference . Rosenstein responded that this was not a good idea because if the press asked him , he would tell the truth that Comey 's firing was not his idea . Sessions also informed the White House Counsel 's Office that evening that Rosenstein was upset that his memorandum was being portrayed as the reason for Comey 's termination .
Trump summoned McCabe to the White House in the wake of Comey 's firing , and :
... asked McCabe whether many people in the FBI disliked Comey and whether McCabe was part of the 'resistance ' that had disagreed with Comey 's decisions in the Clinton investigation . McCabe told the President that he knew Comey had told the President he was not under investigation , that most people in the FBI felt positively about Comey , and that McCabe worked 'very closely ' with Comey and was part of all the decisions that had been made in the Clinton investigation .
Trump met with McCabe again later , and Trump `` without prompting , told McCabe that people in the FBI loved the President , estimated that at least 80 % of the FBI had voted for him , and asked McCabe who he had voted for in the 2016 presidential election . ''
Ultimately , Trump chose McCabe as the temporary acting FBI director but was suspicious of him because his wife had run for the Virginia state legislature as a Democrat . McCabe would later tell CBS News that he authorized an investigation into Trump 's ties to Russia because he feared that if he were `` removed quickly or reassigned or fired , that the case could not be closed or vanish in the night without a trace . '' Trump fired McCabe from the FBI just 26 hours before his retirement was set to take effect , denying him his full pension .","Meet The People In Trump's Orbit Who The Mueller Report Says Ignored His Orders

Attorney General William Barr said there would be no obstruction of justice charges against the president stemming from the report by special counsel Robert Mueller, which was released in redacted form on Thursday.

But the threshold for charging the president might have been breached, had staffers not resisted his directives to engage in actions that would have impeded the investigation.

The more-than-400-page report names 10 onetime close aides or other government officials who refused to carry out requests Trump made that may have violated the law.

""The President's efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests,"" Mueller wrote on Page 158 of the report.

Some of the resistance came from people Trump loathed, such as FBI Director James Comey, whom the president would controversially fire (thus launching Mueller's investigation in the first place). But other close members of his team also rebuffed the president, including his former chief of staff, campaign manager and White House counsel.

Here is a list of those who acted as essentially legal guardrails for the president and may have also kept themselves out of legal peril.

McGahn left the White House in October 2018.

Sessions had decided in March 2017 to recuse himself from any investigations into ties between Trump's campaign and Russia because of meetings he had with the Russian ambassador in 2016.

MOSCOW (AP) — Nearly 1,400 people were detained in a violent police crackdown on an opposition protest in Moscow, a Russian monitoring group said Sunday, adding that was the largest number of detentions at a rally in the Russian capital this decade.

Full Coverage: Russia

OVD-Info, which has monitored police arrests since 2011, said the number of the detentions from Saturday’s protest reached 1,373 by early Sunday. The overwhelming majority of people were soon released but 150 remained in custody, OVD-Info and a lawyers’ legal aid group said Sunday.

Crackdowns on the anti-government protesters began days before the rally. Opposition leader Alexei Navalny was arrested and sentenced Wednesday to 30 days in jail for calling for Saturday’s protest against election authorities who barred some opposition candidates from running in the Sept. 8 vote for Moscow city council.

Navalny was unexpectedly hospitalized Sunday with a severe allergy attack, his spokeswoman said.

Kira Yarmysh said Navalny, who did not have any allergies beforehand, was taken from the Moscow jail to a hospital in the morning, arriving with severe facial swelling and red rashes. Hours later, she said Navalny was in a “satisfactory condition.”

Russian police violently dispersed thousands of people who thronged the streets of Moscow on Saturday to protest the move by election authorities. Several protesters reported broken limbs and head injuries. Police justified their response by saying that the rally was not sanctioned by authorities.

Along with the arrests of the mostly young demonstrators, several opposition activists who wanted to run for the Moscow City Duma were arrested throughout the city.

Police eventually cordoned off the City Hall and dispersed protesters from the area, but thousands of demonstrators reassembled in several different locations nearby and a new round of arrests began. Russian police beat some protesters to the ground with wide truncheon swings while others tried to push the police away.

Police said the protesters numbered about 3,500 but aerial footage from several locations suggested at least 8,000 people turned out.

Dmitry Gudkov, an opposition figure who was barred from running for city council office in Moscow, was detained Sunday afternoon as he delivered food to some of the Moscow protesters still in jail.

The U.S. Embassy in Moscow on Sunday decried the violent crackdown as “use of disproportionate police force” and the Russian presidential human rights council said it was concerned about the police brutality.

Russian President Vladimir Putin stayed away from Moscow over the weekend.

On Sunday, he led Russia’s first major naval parade in years, going aboard one of the vessels in the Navy Day parade in St. Petersburg, on the Gulf of Finland. The parade included 43 ships and submarines and 4,000 troops.",www.apnews.com,center,NjqgBR1SZvYEbmO5

WH spokesman : If meeting with Trump does n't happen , 'it 's the North Koreans ' fault '
WH spokesman : If meeting with Trump does n't happen , 'it 's the North Koreans ' fault ' Evan Vucci/AP
The White House principal deputy press secretary said Sunday he believes that President Donald Trump still “ intends to ” meet with special counsel Robert Mueller under oath .
Trump spokesperson Raj Shah responded to a question by ███ Chief White House Correspondent Jonathan Karl , who said Trump has told him twice that he plans to meet with the special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation and will answer questions under oath .
Karl asked Shah on `` This Week '' Sunday if `` the president plans to keep his word . ''
Shah responded , `` I 'm sure he intends to , '' adding that the president 's `` attorneys are communicating with the special counsel on the specifics regarding that . ''
Karl also asked if there were any circumstances under which the president would seek to have Mueller fired . “ For instance , ” Karl said , “ If Mueller were to begin to look into the Stormy Daniels payoff , would that be a red line ? Would the president fire him ? ”
“ I 'm not here to declare any red lines . There 's no intention whatsoever to fire Robert Mueller , the special counsel , right now , '' the deputy press secretary said . `` We 've been fully cooperative . We respect their process . We 're hoping it will come to a conclusion in the near future . ”
Stormy Daniels , the stage name of the adult film actress , Stephanie Clifford , has claimed to have had an affair with Trump prior to his presidency . On Tuesday , she filed a lawsuit against the president alleging that a nondisclosure agreement ( NDA ) about the alleged affair which she signed 11 days before the 2016 election is not valid because Trump never signed it .
Trump ’ s personal lawyer , Michael Cohen , has said he used $ 130,000 of his own money to pay Clifford for signing the NDA .
Karl on Sunday asked Shah if the president approved of this payment .
Emails provided to ███ by Clifford 's lawyer , Michael Avenatti , seem to show Cohen used his Trump Organization email address to arrange the wire transfer of the payment , but Cohen says this is not proof that the president knew of the transaction , as Avenatti asserts .
Cohen also said in a previous statement to ███ that neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign `` was a party to the transaction with Ms. Clifford , and neither reimbursed me for the payment , either directly or indirectly .

The White House principal deputy press secretary said Sunday he believes that President Donald Trump still “intends to” meet with special counsel Robert Mueller under oath.

Trump spokesperson Raj Shah responded to a question by ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Jonathan Karl, who said Trump has told him twice that he plans to meet with the special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation and will answer questions under oath.

Karl asked Shah on ""This Week"" Sunday if ""the president plans to keep his word.""

Shah responded, ""I'm sure he intends to,"" adding that the president's ""attorneys are communicating with the special counsel on the specifics regarding that.""

Karl also asked if there were any circumstances under which the president would seek to have Mueller fired. “For instance,” Karl said, “If Mueller were to begin to look into the Stormy Daniels payoff, would that be a red line? Would the president fire him?”

“I'm not here to declare any red lines. There's no intention whatsoever to fire Robert Mueller, the special counsel, right now,"" the deputy press secretary said. ""We've been fully cooperative. We respect their process. We're hoping it will come to a conclusion in the near future.”

Stormy Daniels, the stage name of the adult film actress, Stephanie Clifford, has claimed to have had an affair with Trump prior to his presidency. On Tuesday, she filed a lawsuit against the president alleging that a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) about the alleged affair which she signed 11 days before the 2016 election is not valid because Trump never signed it.

Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, has said he used $130,000 of his own money to pay Clifford for signing the NDA.

Karl on Sunday asked Shah if the president approved of this payment.

Shah said, “Not that I'm aware of.”

Emails provided to ABC News by Clifford's lawyer, Michael Avenatti, seem to show Cohen used his Trump Organization email address to arrange the wire transfer of the payment, but Cohen says this is not proof that the president knew of the transaction, as Avenatti asserts.

Cohen also said in a previous statement to ABC News that neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign ""was a party to the transaction with Ms. Clifford, and neither reimbursed me for the payment, either directly or indirectly. The payment to Ms. Clifford was lawful, and was not a campaign contribution or a campaign expenditure by anyone.”

Karl asked Shah on ""This Week"" if the president himself directly reimbursed Cohen for the payment.

“Not to my knowledge,” Shah responded. But he acknowledged, “I haven't asked the president about that question.”",www.abcnews.go.com,left,lVj8oFdondG8k1bk

If the attorney is accurate , it delivers another credibility blow to the Democratic Party-financed dossier , which accuses Mr. Manafort of orchestrating Trump-Russia collusion .
Kevin Downing , a defense attorney for Mr. Manafort , filed the brief April 30 in the special counsel ’ s money-laundering case against his client . Those charges are confined to millions of dollars he earned as a political consultant for Ukrainian politicians .
The Ukraine criminal case , to date in public court filings , has nothing to do with alleged Trump-Russia coordination . But Mr. Downing ’ s brief to a federal judge is relevant to the Mueller Russia investigation because it punches a big hole in dossier conspiracies being investigated by the FBI and Congress .
Mr . Downing said he has asked Mr. Mueller ’ s prosecutors multiple times under mandatory discovery rules for any information showing any communication between Mr. Manafort and Russian officials during the campaign season .
“ The special counsel has not produced any materials to the defense — no tapes , notes , transcripts or any other material evidencing surveillance or intercepts of communications between Mr. Manafort and Russian intelligence officials , Russian government officials [ or any other foreign officials ] , ” Mr . Downing said . “ The Office of Special Counsel has advised that there are no materials responsive to Mr. Manafort ’ s request . ”
Mr . Downing said that government-sourced news stories saying Mr. Manafort communicated with Russians during the campaign were an “ elaborate hoax . ”
Mr. Downing ’ s declaration deals another blow to the veracity of the dossier , funded by the Democratic Party and the Hillary Clinton campaign and written by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele .
Mr. Steele laid out a supposed “ extensive conspiracy ” between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin , and Mr. Manafort , as the dossier narrative goes , was right in the middle of it .
Mr. Steele wrote , “ speaking in confidence to a compatriot in late July 2016 , Source B , an ethnic Russian close associate of Republican US presidential candidate Donald TRUMP , admitted that there was a well-developed conspiracy of co-operation between them and the Russian leadership . This was managed on the TRUMP side by the Republican candidates campaign manager , Paul MANAFORT , who was using foreign policy advisor , Carter PAGE , and others as intermediaries . ”
Mr . Page and Mr. Manafort have denied all the dossier ’ s Trump-Russia collusion charges , none of which have been confirmed publicly .
The fact that the special counsel , according to Mr . Downing , says he has no evidence of communications creates questions for other Trump-Russia reporting .
In a major story promoting collusion , The New York Times in February 2017 ran a story that said the U.S. government had complied a large amount of communication intercepts and phone records between Trump campaign officials and Russian intelligence . On its face , the story meant there was collusion .
That June , former FBI director James B. Comey , told the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that the Times story was almost completely wrong . There were no such records .
Then there is the issue of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein , who appointed Mr. Mueller and later gave him the parameters for investigating Mr. Manafort . One justification was the Ukrainian money . There other was allegations of Manafort-Russia coordination to interfere in the 2016 election .
The Rosenstein memo did not provide the source for that allegation . The only public allegation of such coordination is found in the Steele dossier posted online by BuzzFeed on Jan. 10 , 2017 .
The dossier has emerged as one of the more important documents in modern U.S. political history .
The FBI has relied on it greatly . It used the dossier to obtain a court-approved wiretap on Mr . Page , who has not been charged . Agents also relied on the dossier for leads and to question witnesses .
On his book tour , Mr. Comey has said the bureau tried to “ replicate ” Mr. Steele ’ s work .
The FBI formed an alliance with Mr. Steele and committed to paying him $ 50,000 to continue investigating Mr. Trump . But the FBI fired Mr. Steele after he violated FBI rules and went to the news media with his conspiracy tales .
The Republican majority on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence concluded in a final report last week that there was no collusion , thus rejecting all the dossier charges .
The committee ’ s Democrats , led by Rep. Adam Schiff of California , relied on the dossier at hearings and in questioning witnesses . Mr. Schiff applauded Mr. Steele ’ s work .
Mr . Downing made his no-evidence disclosure in a memorandum asking a judge to hold a hearing into government leaks against his client .
He said many of those leaks alleged a Russian-Manafort conspiracy that , while non-existent , damages his clients standing before a trial jury .
He specifically cited The New York Times February 2017 story . The story helped the Times win the George Polk Award in Journalism for its Russia coverage .
“ If the representations of the special counsel are accurate and there is not , in fact , any evidence of communications between Mr. Manafort and foreign officials , then the perpetrators of this elaborate hoax must be identified and punished and the substantial unfair prejudice to Mr. Manafort must be remedied , ” Mr .

At the time I learned that U.S. cyber operations in Russia , across Russia ’ s periphery , and around the world already dwarfed Russian operations in size , capability , and frequency . It wasn ’ t even close , and the expectation was that the gap was about to grow a whole lot wider .
This should hardly come as a surprise . Just compare the defense budgets of the United States and Russia . The president recently signed a gargantuan $ 700 billion gift to the Pentagon , with marginal dissent from either party or their affiliated media outlets . The budget increase alone ( $ 61 billion ) exceeds Russia ’ s entire annual expenditure ( $ 46 ) . The U.S. military budget now equals more than the combined budgets of China , Russia , Britain , Japan , Saudi Arabia , India , and France . As Vice concluded , “ it ’ s 14 times larger than the Kremlin ’ s budget . ”
Furthermore , covert American operations are deeply invested in interrupting democratic processes not only in Russia , but everywhere else . This includes the heart of Europe , where corporate media is now pretending the United States has always respected happy norms and decorum . It is as if the Snowden leaks never happened . The Defense Department ’ s tapping of Angela Merkel ’ s phone never happened . The Obama administration ’ s spying on the German press , including Der Spiegel , never happened . The same administration ’ s outing of German government whistle-blowers never happened .
Electoral meddling in particular happens all the time , both to us and by us . The U.S. government rigged the Russian election for Yeltsin in 1996 , and then they bragged about it in a cover story for Time . ( You can still find the cover online . ) This followed the disastrous capitalist “ shock therapy ” of the early nineties and preceded the rise of the Russian oligarchs . Putin ’ s brand of nationalist resentment grew out of this moment of extreme collective humiliation . Meanwhile , Hillary Clinton is happily on record pushing for the tampering of Palestinian elections in 2006 .
As the political scientist Dov H. Levin has shown , between 1946 and 2000 , the United States government conducted at least 81 electoral interventions in other countries , while Russia conducted at least 36 . This does not include the U.S. government ’ s violent overthrow of dozens of governments during this same period , including democratic governments in places like Iran ( 1953 ) , Guatemala ( 1954 ) , Congo ( 1960 ) , Brazil ( 1964 ) , and Chile ( 1973 ) . As recent as 2009 , Hillary Clinton ’ s State Department played a complicit role in the brutal deposition of democratically elected president Manuel Zelaya ’ s government in Honduras . No other country , including Russia , even approaches this level of wanton disregard for the norms of sovereignty . Around the world , organizations that the U.S. “ fund [ s ] , support [ s ] and direct [ s ] are openly dedicated to manipulating foreign elections , creating U.S.-friendly opposition movements and even overthrowing governments that impede U.S. interests worldwide. ” In 1999 , President Clinton sent three advisers to Israel to try to swing the country ’ s elections for Ehud Barak . The New York Times reported that they were “ writing advertisements , plotting strategy and taking polls ” for the candidate . Imagine what the reaction would be if Putin had literally dispatched three top deputies to join the Trump campaign .
Of course , a few dozen wrongs don ’ t make a right , and the fact that U.S. outrage over Russian interference is comically hypocritical doesn ’ t make tampering with our elections unobjectionable . But anyone who sees the Russian activity as an antidemocratic outrage should be condemning the United States just as loudly , and treating the Russia story as some kind of unprecedented act of covert control is laughable .
That said , just because the United States leads the world in meddling of all kinds , that doesn ’ t mean we are immune to it . In fact , meddling from abroad comes in many forms . Prominent think tanks in Washington are funded by the Gulf states . The United Arab Emirates contributes generously to the coffers of the Middle East Institute ( MEI ) and the Center for American Progress ( CAP ) . The Brookings Institute graciously accepts millions from Qatar . The Atlantic Council and Center for Strategic and International Studies enjoy similar arrangements with other oppressive regimes like Saudi Arabia . The same can be said for numerous other repressive governments beyond the Gulf . And then there are the defense contractors , Wall Street banks , and Silicon Valley behemoths , all of which have joined such governments in capturing intellectual real estate in academia as well .
Our politicians , of course , are being flooded with cash from foreign-related interests . Pro-Israel billionaires like Sheldon Adelson and Haim Saban have bought themselves outsized influence in both parties , with Adelson successfully financing Trump ’ s rise to power and Saban effectively blocking Keith Ellison ’ s bid for Democratic National Committee chair . The Turkish lobby , likewise , continues to prove itself another bipartisan force , with everyone from former House leader Dick Gephardt to disgraced national security advisor Michael Flynn being enlisted to secure Ankara prerogatives while whitewashing various crimes against the Armenians and Kurds . As for explicit electoral interference , Saudi Arabia and the UAE have been implicated in foul play in the 2016 election . Same goes for Ukraine . Same goes for Israel in 2012 . And these are just the instances so brazen that they have made their way into Wikipedia .
Lastly , our entire corporate media is owned and run by a global capitalist elite who could care less about us and our schoolkid patriotism . There are essentially five multinational corporations that now own the news media . This is down from six just a few years ago . In 1983 it was 50 . This rapid consolidation is thanks to the Telecommunications Act of 1996 , itself a bipartisan bill purchased by the donor class . The few dozen billionaires with the largest shares in these companies are almost all white men . They are also almost all tied up in business investments around the globe . And almost all their investments bear zero regard for the needs or desires of Americans or non-Americans alike .
For Russian interference to be a threat to our democracy , we would have to have a democracy to begin with . But our elections are already so heavily manipulated by corporations and foreign governments that it ’ s hard to take seriously anyone who sees Russia as a singular threat to our system of government . The issue needs to be kept in perspective , and seen in the context of both our country ’ s own actions and the other , even greater , barriers that prevent us from having a true democracy that reflects the will of the people rather than corporate and government interests .
Look , by all means , let ’ s protect the integrity of our voting systems . As Seth Ackerman just counseled in Jacobin , let ’ s follow Europe ’ s lead in a practical , guarded response to Putin ’ s authoritarian machinations , free of hysteria . Let ’ s keep pushing for independent investigations into Trump , his team , and their possibly criminal involvement with the Russian government and other unsavory entities . Let ’ s hold them accountable accordingly . But let ’ s also stop swallowing state and corporate propaganda hook , line , and sinker . Let ’ s stop being blind to military-industrial stakes in escalating U.S.-Russia tensions in Syria , Yemen , Iran , Ukraine , and the Russian periphery , never mind the cyber arena altogether . Let ’ s spend more time exposing the ways the conversation around Russia points to liberal and progressive acquiescence toward ( one might say collusion with ) imperialist narratives that only guarantee further death and destruction for poor and working people everywhere .
Beyond all that , let ’ s finally start doing the hard work of fleshing out a left foreign policy . Aziz Rana has an urgent piece in N+1 arguing that the left lacks a coherent approach to international affairs , and needs to spend its time articulating a clear response to the “ bipartisan cold war ideology that has shaped American elite thinking since the 1940s , organized around the idea that the US rightly enjoys military and economic primacy because its interests are the world ’ s interests. ” Rana lays out a set of principles that can guide the creation of an alternative approach and answer difficult practical questions like “ If the US should not be the enforcer of Saudi and Israeli led dictates in the Middle East , what are alternative regional orderings ? ” and “ What would demobilizing significant elements of the national security state look like ? ” We should do our best to make sure that everyone reads Rana ’ s piece , and faces up to the challenge he poses . Doing so will require us to be thoughtful and consistent , and to make sure that instead of following the corporate media ’ s lead on what to be outraged about , we work it out for ourselves and keep things in perspective .

The Turkish lobby, likewise, continues to prove itself another bipartisan force, with everyone from former House leader Dick Gephardt to disgraced national security advisor Michael Flynn being enlisted to secure Ankara prerogatives while whitewashing various crimes against the Armenians and Kurds. As for explicit electoral interference, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have been implicated in foul play in the 2016 election. Same goes for Ukraine. Same goes for Israel in 2012. And these are just the instances so brazen that they have made their way into Wikipedia.

Lastly, our entire corporate media is owned and run by a global capitalist elite who could care less about us and our schoolkid patriotism. There are essentially five multinational corporations that now own the news media. This is down from six just a few years ago. In 1983 it was 50. This rapid consolidation is thanks to the Telecommunications Act of 1996, itself a bipartisan bill purchased by the donor class. The few dozen billionaires with the largest shares in these companies are almost all white men. They are also almost all tied up in business investments around the globe. And almost all their investments bear zero regard for the needs or desires of Americans or non-Americans alike.

For Russian interference to be a threat to our democracy, we would have to have a democracy to begin with. But our elections are already so heavily manipulated by corporations and foreign governments that it’s hard to take seriously anyone who sees Russia as a singular threat to our system of government. The issue needs to be kept in perspective, and seen in the context of both our country’s own actions and the other, even greater, barriers that prevent us from having a true democracy that reflects the will of the people rather than corporate and government interests.

Look, by all means, let’s protect the integrity of our voting systems. As Seth Ackerman just counseled in Jacobin, let’s follow Europe’s lead in a practical, guarded response to Putin’s authoritarian machinations, free of hysteria. Let’s keep pushing for independent investigations into Trump, his team, and their possibly criminal involvement with the Russian government and other unsavory entities. Let’s hold them accountable accordingly. But let’s also stop swallowing state and corporate propaganda hook, line, and sinker. Let’s stop being blind to military-industrial stakes in escalating U.S.-Russia tensions in Syria, Yemen, Iran, Ukraine, and the Russian periphery, never mind the cyber arena altogether. Let’s spend more time exposing the ways the conversation around Russia points to liberal and progressive acquiescence toward (one might say collusion with) imperialist narratives that only guarantee further death and destruction for poor and working people everywhere.

Beyond all that, let’s finally start doing the hard work of fleshing out a left foreign policy. Aziz Rana has an urgent piece in N+1 arguing that the left lacks a coherent approach to international affairs, and needs to spend its time articulating a clear response to the “bipartisan cold war ideology that has shaped American elite thinking since the 1940s, organized around the idea that the US rightly enjoys military and economic primacy because its interests are the world’s interests.” Rana lays out a set of principles that can guide the creation of an alternative approach and answer difficult practical questions like “If the US should not be the enforcer of Saudi and Israeli led dictates in the Middle East, what are alternative regional orderings?” and “What would demobilizing significant elements of the national security state look like?” We should do our best to make sure that everyone reads Rana’s piece, and faces up to the challenge he poses. Doing so will require us to be thoughtful and consistent, and to make sure that instead of following the corporate media’s lead on what to be outraged about, we work it out for ourselves and keep things in perspective.

Steele emerges triumphant

Analysis by Paul Wood, Special Correspondent, BBC News

This is a significant victory for Christopher Steele, who had argued through his lawyers that the owners of Alfa Bank - ""Alpha"" in the dossier - were trying to intimidate him into silence.

The court in Washington DC said Steele should have the same guarantees of free speech - under the first amendment to the US constitution - as American citizens. (Specifically, the court said, he should get the protection given by legislation designed to stop lawsuits being used by rich individuals to stop public debate.)

Alfa's owners accused Steele of acting maliciously or recklessly when he wrote a headline about ""co-operation"" between ""Alpha"" and the Kremlin in the US presidential election.

But the judgment says this headline represents Steele's opinion based on what his sources were telling him about the Alfa oligarchs' long relationship with Vladimir Putin, including the claim that they sent him ""large amounts of illicit cash"" when he was deputy mayor of St Petersburg.

It is true, as the court notes, that the dossier ""does not present any direct evidence that Alfa interfered in the election"".

The FBI has been investigating whether a computer server in Trump Tower was communicating with one belonging to Alfa Bank during the campaign. It is not known what, if anything, the FBI found.

Lawyers for the Russian billionaires told the BBC in a statement they would probably appeal the decision.

The three billionaires have previously brought a defamation case against Fusion GPS, the Washington DC-based research company that hired Mr Steele.

The dossier - containing salacious allegations against President Donald Trump - was first published BuzzFeed in January 2017.

The story reported that Trump Jr. 's response — that negotiations on one project concluded by the end of 2014 — contrasted with the version of events as laid out in the guilty plea by Michael Cohen on Thursday . In fact , Trump Jr. and investigators were alluding to a different set of negotiations — not to a deal that Cohen was reportedly pursuing . Trump Jr. did acknowledge in his testimony that Cohen and another man were exploring a possible deal in Moscow in 2015 or 2016 .
Trump Jr. did not address what Cohen has now admitted — that talks about such a deal continued at least into June 2016 , longer than previously known and well into the presidential campaign .
This week 's guilty plea by Donald Trump 's ex-attorney Michael Cohen has raised questions about Donald Trump Jr. 's testimony to Congress regarding his family 's real estate negotiations with powerful Russians .
Trump Jr. told the Senate Judiciary Committee in September 2017 that he was only `` peripherally aware '' of negotiations that Cohen has admitted to carrying on through June 2016 .
Cohen said in his guilty plea that he had briefed Trump 's family members about his talks , although the court documents do n't specify who .
Trump Jr. also told Senate investigators that he was n't aware that Cohen had reached out to the press secretary for Vladimir Putin as part of his talks with Moscow about a putative new Trump Tower project there .
Cohen had previously told Congress that although he emailed Putin 's spokesman , Dmitry Peskov , he had n't heard back , and the discussions with people in Moscow concluded by January 2016 .
Cohen then acknowledged in his guilty plea that , in fact , Peskov had responded to him and he and others had continued negotiations about the project until after Trump had become the presumptive GOP nominee .
Trump Jr. 's answers allude to a number of prospective projects ; he was asked by Senate investigators about news reports about a Trump Tower Moscow negotiation that took place in 2015 and 2016 , which he acknowledged but did not detail .
An attorney for Trump Jr. did n't immediately respond to a request for comment on this story .
Earlier this year , when other potential discrepancies arose between what Cohen was saying and what Trump Jr. told Congress , attorney Alan Futerfas stood by Trump Jr. 's testimony .
`` Donald Trump Jr. has been professional and responsible throughout the Mueller and congressional investigations , '' he said in the summer . `` We are very confident of the accuracy and reliability of the information that has been provided by Mr. Trump Jr. , and on his behalf . ''
Separately , an attorney for President Trump , Rudy Giuliani , said on Thursday that no laws have been broken and that the information that underpins Cohen 's plea actually came from the Trump Organization — confirming that it has been supporting the ongoing investigations .
`` Michael Cohen is a liar , '' Giuliani said . `` It 's no surprise that Cohen lied to Congress . He 's a proven liar who is doing everything he can to get out of a long-term prison sentence for serious crimes of bank and tax fraud that had nothing to do with the Trump Organization . ''
Continued Giuliani : `` It is important to understand that documents that the special counsel 's office is using to show that Cohen lied to Congress were voluntarily disclosed by the Trump Organization because there was nothing to hide . ''
President Trump downplayed the importance of the negotiations in a Twitter post on Friday that said he 'd only `` lightly '' looked into a Moscow project and underscored how it never moved forward .
The shift in understanding of the events of 2016 provided by Cohen is important for a few reasons :
First , it called into question the Trump family 's denials about having business dealings with Russians . Second , it confirmed the Trumps had a channel open with powerful Russians at the same time the Russian government was waging a widespread campaign of `` active measures '' against the United States .
And third , it put the Russian government and others in Moscow in the position of being able to know , confidentially , the truth about the Trump family 's denials about negotiations over the Moscow real estate deals .
According to Trump Jr. and others who have spoken to Congress , the Trump family negotiated one of its potential projects with Moscow real estate billionaire Aras Agalarov and his family .
Aras and his son Emin also were in the chain of contacts used to convey an offer of help for the Trump campaign from the Russian government to Trump Jr. , one that yielded a meeting in New York City in June 2016 . Trump Jr. and other top campaign leaders hosted a delegation they believed would deliver dirt on Hillary Clinton .
A representative for the Agalarovs , Ike Kaveladze , also attended that conference on June 9 in New York City . Aras Agalarov asked him to attend , he told Senate investigators . He was briefed beforehand about the presentation he said attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya intended to give , Kaveladze said .
The Russians intended to tell the Trump campaign leaders about what they called a scheme involving American investors funneling money to the Democratic National Committee , Kaveladze told investigators .
The contrasts between Cohen 's statement and Trump Jr 's version of events may complicate potential legal problems for Trump Jr . Although seldom prosecuted , lying to Congress is against the law — as evidenced by Cohen 's plea .
Sen. Richard Burr , R-N.C. , chairman of the Senate intelligence committee , said he has made referrals to the office of Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller because he said he believed people had n't given his committee the truth .
He declined to identify who might be involved or how often he has referred cases to Mueller , but Burr did allude to Cohen 's plea as an example of what he called the consequences that could be involved .
`` One instance just highlighted of late is that the special prosecutor made an indictment yesterday using the transcripts of interviews we have done in our committee to indict somebody for lying to Congress , '' Burr said on Friday .
`` It 's a loud message to everybody that is interviewed by our committee . ... If you lie to us we 're going to go after you . ''
Trump Jr. was advised in his Senate Judiciary Committee interview that although he had n't sworn an oath to tell the truth , he was required by law to answer questions from Congress truthfully . He was asked whether he understood that .","Cohen's Account Of Russia Talks Raises Questions About Trump Jr. 2017 Testimony

Updated at 4 p.m. ET

Editor's note: An earlier version of this report mischaracterized an answer Donald Trump Jr. gave to Senate investigators in 2017 about the prospective projects his family was negotiating with people in Moscow.

The story reported that Trump Jr.'s response — that negotiations on one project concluded by the end of 2014 — contrasted with the version of events as laid out in the guilty plea by Michael Cohen on Thursday. In fact, Trump Jr. and investigators were alluding to a different set of negotiations — not to a deal that Cohen was reportedly pursuing. Trump Jr. did acknowledge in his testimony that Cohen and another man were exploring a possible deal in Moscow in 2015 or 2016.

Trump Jr. did not address what Cohen has now admitted — that talks about such a deal continued at least into June 2016, longer than previously known and well into the presidential campaign.

This week's guilty plea by Donald Trump's ex-attorney Michael Cohen has raised questions about Donald Trump Jr.'s testimony to Congress regarding his family's real estate negotiations with powerful Russians.

Trump Jr. told the Senate Judiciary Committee in September 2017 that he was only ""peripherally aware"" of negotiations that Cohen has admitted to carrying on through June 2016.

Cohen said in his guilty plea that he had briefed Trump's family members about his talks, although the court documents don't specify who.

Trump Jr. also told Senate investigators that he wasn't aware that Cohen had reached out to the press secretary for Vladimir Putin as part of his talks with Moscow about a putative new Trump Tower project there.

Cohen had previously told Congress that although he emailed Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, he hadn't heard back, and the discussions with people in Moscow concluded by January 2016.

Cohen then acknowledged in his guilty plea that, in fact, Peskov had responded to him and he and others had continued negotiations about the project until after Trump had become the presumptive GOP nominee.

Trump Jr.'s answers allude to a number of prospective projects; he was asked by Senate investigators about news reports about a Trump Tower Moscow negotiation that took place in 2015 and 2016, which he acknowledged but did not detail.

Looking ""lightly""

An attorney for Trump Jr. didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on this story.

Earlier this year, when other potential discrepancies arose between what Cohen was saying and what Trump Jr. told Congress, attorney Alan Futerfas stood by Trump Jr.'s testimony.

""Donald Trump Jr. has been professional and responsible throughout the Mueller and congressional investigations,"" he said in the summer. ""We are very confident of the accuracy and reliability of the information that has been provided by Mr. Trump Jr., and on his behalf.""

Separately, an attorney for President Trump, Rudy Giuliani, said on Thursday that no laws have been broken and that the information that underpins Cohen's plea actually came from the Trump Organization — confirming that it has been supporting the ongoing investigations.

""Michael Cohen is a liar,"" Giuliani said. ""It's no surprise that Cohen lied to Congress. He's a proven liar who is doing everything he can to get out of a long-term prison sentence for serious crimes of bank and tax fraud that had nothing to do with the Trump Organization.""

Continued Giuliani: ""It is important to understand that documents that the special counsel's office is using to show that Cohen lied to Congress were voluntarily disclosed by the Trump Organization because there was nothing to hide.""

President Trump downplayed the importance of the negotiations in a Twitter post on Friday that said he'd only ""lightly"" looked into a Moscow project and underscored how it never moved forward.

The timeline

The shift in understanding of the events of 2016 provided by Cohen is important for a few reasons:

First, it called into question the Trump family's denials about having business dealings with Russians. Second, it confirmed the Trumps had a channel open with powerful Russians at the same time the Russian government was waging a widespread campaign of ""active measures"" against the United States.

And third, it put the Russian government and others in Moscow in the position of being able to know, confidentially, the truth about the Trump family's denials about negotiations over the Moscow real estate deals.

According to Trump Jr. and others who have spoken to Congress, the Trump family negotiated one of its potential projects with Moscow real estate billionaire Aras Agalarov and his family.

Aras and his son Emin also were in the chain of contacts used to convey an offer of help for the Trump campaign from the Russian government to Trump Jr., one that yielded a meeting in New York City in June 2016. Trump Jr. and other top campaign leaders hosted a delegation they believed would deliver dirt on Hillary Clinton.

A representative for the Agalarovs, Ike Kaveladze, also attended that conference on June 9 in New York City. Aras Agalarov asked him to attend, he told Senate investigators. He was briefed beforehand about the presentation he said attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya intended to give, Kaveladze said.

The Russians intended to tell the Trump campaign leaders about what they called a scheme involving American investors funneling money to the Democratic National Committee, Kaveladze told investigators.

The contrasts between Cohen's statement and Trump Jr's version of events may complicate potential legal problems for Trump Jr. Although seldom prosecuted, lying to Congress is against the law — as evidenced by Cohen's plea.

Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, said he has made referrals to the office of Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller because he said he believed people hadn't given his committee the truth.

He declined to identify who might be involved or how often he has referred cases to Mueller, but Burr did allude to Cohen's plea as an example of what he called the consequences that could be involved.

""One instance just highlighted of late is that the special prosecutor made an indictment yesterday using the transcripts of interviews we have done in our committee to indict somebody for lying to Congress,"" Burr said on Friday.

""It's a loud message to everybody that is interviewed by our committee. ... If you lie to us we're going to go after you.""

Trump Jr. was advised in his Senate Judiciary Committee interview that although he hadn't sworn an oath to tell the truth, he was required by law to answer questions from Congress truthfully. He was asked whether he understood that.

""I do,"" Trump Jr. answered.

US President Donald Trump has criticised the administration of his predecessor Barack Obama over alleged Russian hacking to help him win the 2016 presidential election.

""Why didn't they do something about it?"" he tweeted, adding that Mr Obama had been told about it before the vote.

It follows pressure on Mr Trump to cancel Monday's talks with Russia's Vladimir Putin following the indictment of 12 Russians on Friday.

Russia denies allegations of hacking.

Mr Trump is due to meet Mr Putin in the Finnish capital Helsinki.

Russia said it was looking forward to the meeting.

""We consider Trump a negotiating partner,"" said Kremlin adviser Yuri Ushakov. ""The state of bilateral relations is very bad. We have to start to set them right.""

However the hacking allegations have sparked a heated war of words between Washington and Moscow.

US Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein insisted that ""the goal of the conspirators was to have an impact on the election"".

But Russia's foreign ministry said the claims were a ""heap of conspiracy schemes"" intended to ""damage the atmosphere"" before Monday's summit.

It said there was no evidence linking any of the dozen officials to hacking or military intelligence.

What are the allegations?

The 11-count indictment names the Russians defendants, alleging they began cyber-attacks in March 2016 on the email accounts of staff for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.

They are accused of using keystroke reading software to spy on the chair of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and hack into the party's computers.

Mr Rosenstein said the conspirators used fictitious online personas, including ""DCLeaks"" and ""Guccifer 2.0"", to release thousands of stolen emails.

They are also accused of stealing the data of half a million voters from a state election board website.

What pressure is there to cancel the talks?

During a joint news conference with UK Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday, Mr Trump said he would ""absolutely"" ask the Russian president about alleged election meddling.

But top Democrats have urged him to cancel the planned summit altogether following the indictment.

Or is its preference simply the candidate through whom it can create the most chaos ?
As voters headed to the polls Tuesday in 14 states from Texas to Tennessee , questions like these are overhanging the entire election . On Monday , U.S. intelligence agencies and federal departments issued a rare joint statement warning that foreign influence campaigns continue to spread “ false information and propaganda . ”
Perhaps unsurprisingly for a country run by a former KGB operative , the answer is complicated .
First of all , it ’ s not clear to what extent Russia is influencing American voters online . As social media companies and intelligence agencies bolster their efforts to prevent large-scale disinformation campaigns , Russia is trying to fly under the radar .

After all , it ’ s not just Russians posting polarizing content online . If there hadn ’ t been American trolls back in 2016 , there wouldn ’ t have been anyone for the Russians to pretend to be .
And it ’ s not just social media ; TV and talk radio also contribute to a polarized media ecosystem . Still , there ’ s a qualitative difference in the threat posed by Russian disinformation – which could sow doubts about the legitimacy of election results .
“ Foreign trolls are a small percentage of it , ” says Renee DiResta , technical research manager at the Stanford Internet Observatory , who coauthored a report for the Senate Intelligence Committee quantifying and analyzing Russia ’ s influence operations targeting U.S. citizens from 2014-17 . “ The challenge is that their presence is potentially used to discredit the results of an election and suggest that outsiders are tampering , which is why continuing to detect that is such an important thing . ”
If there is a contested Democratic convention this summer , Mr. Watts says Russia would almost certainly exploit that by pushing the notion that the system was rigged against Mr. Sanders . That ’ s a narrative Russia very effectively fed when its military intelligence unit hacked into Democratic National Committee emails and leaked documents showing the party establishment ’ s preference for Mrs. Clinton . This year , Mr. Sanders ’ supporters could be even more angry if they suspect the nomination was stolen from them .

Is Russia seeking to boost Trump, Sanders?

Long before Vladimir Putin ascended to the Russian presidency or Mr. Trump had any hope of winning a U.S. election, the Kremlin was looking for candidates and officials in adversarial countries who could work from within to boost Moscow’s interests. That was part of the old Soviet playbook, says Clint Watts, an ex-FBI agent who began tracking Russian disinformation campaigns targeting the U.S. in 2014.

At the start of the 2016 cycle, the main thrust of Russia’s influence operations was a very focused effort to undermine former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, whom President Putin believed was behind opposition protests in Russia.

Then a new theme emerged, says Mr. Watts: “This Donald Trump guy would be great for us, and he’s hyperdivisive.”

Russia also looked favorably on Sen. Bernie Sanders, who back when he was the democratic socialist mayor of Burlington, Vermont, had visited Cuba and Nicaragua.

According to a 2018 indictment, social media specialists involved in the 2016 Russian meddling were instructed to “use any opportunity to criticize Hillary and the rest (except Sanders and Trump – we support them).”

Why? Populists tend to act as a divisive wedge because they’re so passionate and angry, says Mr. Watts. That feeds into Russia’s goal of making American democracy look dysfunctional, undermining the world’s faith in U.S. leadership and weakening alliances that Russia sees as opposing its own interests.

“Their long-run goal is break up NATO, break up the EU, advance their position around the world, and lower America on the world stage so there’s more space for them to elevate themselves,” says Mr. Watts.

Russia is reportedly again seeking to boost both President Trump and Senator Sanders, who was briefed by intelligence officials on the matter, according to the Washington Post. The Vermont senator denounced any Russian attempts to undermine American democracy, calling President Putin “an autocratic thug.”

“My message to Putin is clear: Stay out of American elections, and as president I will make sure that you do,” Mr. Sanders said.

Mr. Trump, for his part, has called the reports of Russia aiding his reelection campaign “disinformation.”

Cracking down on Russian disinformation

In Monday’s joint statement, the heads of the Departments of State, Justice, Defense, and Homeland Security, as well as three intelligence agencies and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) cited an “unprecedented level of commitment and effort to protect our elections and to counter malign foreign influence” and warned of “sharp consequences” for any foreign powers who dared meddle.

CISA is working with all 50 states and more than 2,300 local jurisdictions to secure the country’s election systems, including free vulnerability scanning and onsite risk assessments. The FBI is working with social media companies, which have invested significantly in election integrity efforts.

Indeed, there is far more alertness now than in 2016, says Ben Nimmo, a pioneer of disinformation investigations.

He notes that one of the most prominent fake accounts in that election cycle, @TEN_GOP, was registered to a Russian mobile number. That wouldn’t fly today – and the Russians likely wouldn’t try it, either. They’re increasingly trying to hide their efforts, says Mr. Nimmo, director of investigations for Graphika, a company that bills itself as the cartographers of the internet age.

For example, some 50 Instagram accounts taken down by Facebook in October used almost no original text, instead copying and pasting from other accounts so as to avoid small grammatical mistakes that would give them away as non-native English speakers. But that has made it hard to build a persona, limiting their reach. Of these accounts, only one had more than 20,000 followers, according to a Graphika report co-authored by Mr. Nimmo.

The accounts taken down included 11 supporting Mr. Trump and four supporting Mr. Sanders. But as a whole, the accounts, which appeared to be part of a network, were working to fuel divisions by posting on opposite sides of controversial issues such as police violence. Some included hashtags like #blacklivesmatter or #policebrutality while others would use #bluelivesmatter or #backtheblue.

“They’re fueling both sides of the argument, because what they want to do is bring the two sides to a clash,” says Ms. Conley of CSIS, who frequently tells audiences: “The American mind is the battle space.”

How polarization muddies the waters

If foreign information operations are like fish swimming in the sea, hyperpartisanship has created hospitable waters for them to swim in, says Mr. Nimmo.

In that environment, he says, voters should be alert to efforts to manipulate them through emotion – whether it’s coming from Russia or a fellow American.

“If I see a post which is trying to make me angry or afraid, maybe I should ask why it’s trying to do that,” he says.

After all, it’s not just Russians posting polarizing content online. If there hadn’t been American trolls back in 2016, there wouldn’t have been anyone for the Russians to pretend to be.

And it’s not just social media; TV and talk radio also contribute to a polarized media ecosystem. Still, there’s a qualitative difference in the threat posed by Russian disinformation – which could sow doubts about the legitimacy of election results.

“Foreign trolls are a small percentage of it,” says Renee DiResta, technical research manager at the Stanford Internet Observatory, who coauthored a report for the Senate Intelligence Committee quantifying and analyzing Russia’s influence operations targeting U.S. citizens from 2014-17. “The challenge is that their presence is potentially used to discredit the results of an election and suggest that outsiders are tampering, which is why continuing to detect that is such an important thing.”

If there is a contested Democratic convention this summer, Mr. Watts says Russia would almost certainly exploit that by pushing the notion that the system was rigged against Mr. Sanders. That’s a narrative Russia very effectively fed when its military intelligence unit hacked into Democratic National Committee emails and leaked documents showing the party establishment’s preference for Mrs. Clinton. This year, Mr. Sanders’ supporters could be even more angry if they suspect the nomination was stolen from them.

It’s not hard to envision “everybody going to the convention and screaming at each other,” says Mr. Watts. “And Russia clapping, because this is exactly what they wanted.”

After nearly two years of waiting , special counsel Robert Mueller 's report into Russia 's attack on the 2016 presidential election is finally done . And there 's growing bipartisan pressure on Attorney General William Barr to make it public .
Barr , who received Mueller 's findings on Friday evening , told congressional leaders in a letter that he was `` reviewing the report and anticipate that I may be in a position to advise you of the Special Counsel 's principal conclusions as soon as this weekend . ''

A Justice Department official said Friday that Mueller 's report does not recommend any future indictments , although criminal charges against more than 30 individuals and entities , including onetime top aides and associates to President Trump , have already been filed .
The Trump administration has said little publicly about the report 's completion , by design , according to Rudy Giuliani , one of Trump 's personal attorneys on the Russia matter .
`` I think we 've said everything we can say , '' Giuliani told NPR Saturday . `` There 's nothing more to be said until we see the report .

Richard Blumenthal , D-Conn. , told NPR 's All Things Considered on Friday that he believes the facts and evidence `` are likely to show collusion and a lot of wrongdoing that might not be indicted .

After nearly two years of waiting, special counsel Robert Mueller's report into Russia's attack on the 2016 presidential election is finally done. And there's growing bipartisan pressure on Attorney General William Barr to make it public.

Barr, who received Mueller's findings on Friday evening, told congressional leaders in a letter that he was ""reviewing the report and anticipate that I may be in a position to advise you of the Special Counsel's principal conclusions as soon as this weekend.""

But a Justice Department official said Saturday afternoon that the information Barr is to provide Congress is ""not coming today.""

Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein were at the Justice Department on Saturday, the official said. ""They're analyzing the report, working very closely together,"" the official added, to put together their submission to Congress.

In a letter to her Democratic colleagues, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Saturday that House Democrats ""are insisting that any briefings to any Committees be unclassified so that Members can speak freely about every aspect of the report and not be confined to what DOJ chooses to release publicly.""

A Justice Department official said Friday that Mueller's report does not recommend any future indictments, although criminal charges against more than 30 individuals and entities, including onetime top aides and associates to President Trump, have already been filed.

The Trump administration has said little publicly about the report's completion, by design, according to Rudy Giuliani, one of Trump's personal attorneys on the Russia matter.

""I think we've said everything we can say,"" Giuliani told NPR Saturday. ""There's nothing more to be said until we see the report. I have the same sort of theory about it that everybody else has. If they're not going to indict anybody else, then they can't have any further evidence of collusion. Otherwise they would have brought some kind of conspiracy indictment.""

Mccarthy, John Mccormack, Michael Brendan Dougherty, Mairead Mcardle, Robert Verbruggen, Carrie Severino, Tobias Hoonhout, Rich Lowry, Jim Geraghty","Democrats will complain , but the attorney general can ’ t be faulted for following the law .
In disclosing the Mueller report , Attorney General William P. Barr will have to redact grand-jury information . That is the upshot of the ruling today by a divided panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C . Circuit .
I flagged this case , now called McKeever v. Barr ( formerly McKeever v. Sessions ) , last week . It did not arise out of the Mueller investigation , but it obviously has significant ramifications for the Mueller report — in particular , how much of it we will get to see .
At issue was this question : Does a federal court have the authority to order disclosure of grand-jury materials if the judge decides that the interests of justice warrant doing so ; or is the judge limited to the exceptions to grand-jury secrecy that are spelled out in Rule 6 ( e ) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure ? The D.C. Circuit ’ s McKeever ruling holds that the text of Rule 6 ( e ) controls . Consequently , judges have no authority to authorize disclosure outside the rule .
This is significant for the Mueller report because Rule 6 ( e ) does not contain an exception to secrecy that would permit disclosure to Congress .
The case involves a writer , Stuart McKeever , who was researching a book on the disappearance of Columbia University professor Jesús de Galíndez Suárez in 1956 . It was suspected that Galíndez , a very public critic of Dominican Republic dictator Rafael Trujillo , was kidnapped and flown to the D.R. , where he was murdered . In the course of a federal investigation , suspicion fell on John Joseph Frank , a former FBI agent and CIA lawyer , who later worked for Trujillo . Frank was eventually prosecuted for failing to register as a foreign agent but never charged with any involvement in Galíndez ’ s murder .
In 2013 , for purposes of his research , McKeever petitioned the court for release of records of the grand-jury proceedings that led to Frank ’ s 1957 indictment . There is nothing in Rule 6 ( e ) that would permit the veil of grand-jury secrecy to be pierced for an academic or literary research project . Yet the district judge asserted that federal courts have “ inherent supervisory power ” to disclose grand-jury materials , including those that are “ historically significant. ” Ultimately , however , the judge denied the petition , reasoning that it was “ overbroad . ”
McKeever appealed . In opposition , the Justice Department argued not only that he should be denied the grand-jury records , but also that the lower court had been wrong to claim authority to disclose the materials outside the strictures of Rule 6 ( e ) . The three-judge panel agreed with the Justice Department , in an opinion written by Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg ( now a senior judge , appointed by President Reagan ) and joined by Judge Gregory Katsas ( appointed by President Trump ) . Judge Sri Srinivasan ( appointed by President Obama ) dissented .
The majority explained that the Supreme Court has long recognized the vital purposes served by grand-jury secrecy , and thus that secrecy must be protected unless there is some clear contrary indication in a statute or rule . Disclosure is the exception , not the rule .
In Rule 6 ( e ) , Congress has prescribed grand-jury secrecy and its exceptions . Those who contend that a court may permit disclosure outside the rule argue that judges had such authority before the rule was enacted . The panel majority , however , emphasized the rule ’ s sweeping language : Officials must refrain from disclosure “ unless these rules provide otherwise. ” The rule also takes pains to spell out the situations in which a judge may authorize disclosure . Plainly , the intent of the rule was to limit disclosure ; were an unwritten judicial power to ignore the limitations recognized , the rule would be pointless .
The exceptions enumerated in the rule permit judges to authorize disclosure , to federal and certain non-federal officials , in order to aid in the enforcement of criminal laws . Clearly , it would be easy to conjure other worthy exceptions . Nevertheless , the panel majority observed , the Supreme Court has stressed that “ not every beneficial purpose , or even every valid governmental purpose , is an appropriate reason for breaching grand jury secrecy . ”
The panel rejected the claim that the D.C. Circuit ’ s decision in a Watergate era case , Haldeman v. Sirica ( 1974 ) , permits disclosure outside the rule . This is salient for purposes of the Mueller report because Haldeman involved an order by the district court ( Judge John Sirica ) permitting transmission of a sealed grand-jury report to the House Judiciary Committee , which was then considering possible grounds to impeach President Nixon .
In his dissent , Judge Srinivasan maintained that Haldeman should control . Judges Ginsburg and Katsas disagreed , relating that the lower and appellate courts in Haldeman failed to conduct any “ meaningful analysis of Rule 6 ( e ) ’ s terms ” ; they merely offered policy arguments in favor of disclosure — with Sirica , for example , suggesting that disclosure to the House of Representatives was analogous to disclosure to another grand jury ( the rule allows the latter ) . Moreover , Haldeman was distinguishable , the majority reasoned , because the disclosure of the grand-jury report was technically done within the context of the criminal case against H. R. Haldeman and his co-defendant , Gordon Strachan ; that is , it was not a direct transmission to the House .
( For what it ’ s worth , I believe Haldeman is distinguishable for an additional reason : The grand jury in that case was operating under a statute that permitted it to file a report , as distinguished from an indictment , which the grand jury itself recommended be transmitted to the House . I described such reports nearly two years ago , when we first learned that Mueller had convened a grand jury ; and Kim Strassel had an excellent Twitter thread about them earlier this week , specifically addressing Haldeman . Such grand-jury reports are very different from what is at issue in the Mueller report . The latter is a prosecutor ’ s report based , in part , on grand-jury evidence ; there are no grand-jury findings or recommendations that its proceedings be transmitted to Congress ; and Democrats are asking for all the grand-jury information , with no view expressed by the grand jury or the witnesses who would be affected . The panel majority , however , did not address these differences — no doubt because the Mueller report was not under consideration in the McKeever case . )
It is foreseeable that McKeever could be further appealed , to the full D.C . Circuit ( an en banc review ) and to the Supreme Court . Not only was the panel divided , but there is a split in the circuits — which the panel majority acknowledges , discussing the relevant cases at the conclusion of its opinion . For now , however , McKeever is the law in the D.C . Circuit , where the Mueller investigation took place . Naturally , the Justice Department must follow it — and it is , again , an affirmation of the Justice Department ’ s position on the law .
This means Attorney General Barr must redact grand-jury material from the Mueller report before disclosing it to Congress . Democrats will complain long and loud about this , but I don ’ t see how Barr can be reasonably faulted for following the law . Congress , after all , has the power to legislate an amendment to Rule 6 ( e ) that would permit disclosure of grand-jury materials from a special counsel investigation to appropriate congressional committees .","Attorney General William Barr (Yuri Gripas/Reuters)

Democrats will complain, but the attorney general can’t be faulted for following the law.

In disclosing the Mueller report, Attorney General William P. Barr will have to redact grand-jury information. That is the upshot of the ruling today by a divided panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.

I flagged this case, now called McKeever v. Barr (formerly McKeever v. Sessions), last week. It did not arise out of the Mueller investigation, but it obviously has significant ramifications for the Mueller report — in particular, how much of it we will get to see.

At issue was this question: Does a federal court have the authority to order disclosure of grand-jury materials if the judge decides that the interests of justice warrant doing so; or is the judge limited to the exceptions to grand-jury secrecy that are spelled out in Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure? The D.C. Circuit’s McKeever ruling holds that the text of Rule 6(e) controls. Consequently, judges have no authority to authorize disclosure outside the rule.

This is significant for the Mueller report because Rule 6(e) does not contain an exception to secrecy that would permit disclosure to Congress.

The case involves a writer, Stuart McKeever, who was researching a book on the disappearance of Columbia University professor Jesús de Galíndez Suárez in 1956. It was suspected that Galíndez, a very public critic of Dominican Republic dictator Rafael Trujillo, was kidnapped and flown to the D.R., where he was murdered.

There is nothing in Rule 6(e) that would permit the veil of grand-jury secrecy to be pierced for an academic or literary research project. Yet the district judge asserted that federal courts have “inherent supervisory power” to disclose grand-jury materials, including those that are “historically significant.” Ultimately, however, the judge denied the petition, reasoning that it was “overbroad.”

The panel rejected the claim that the D.C. Circuit’s decision in a Watergate era case, Haldeman v. Sirica (1974), permits disclosure outside the rule. This is salient for purposes of the Mueller report because Haldeman involved an order by the district court (Judge John Sirica) permitting transmission of a sealed grand-jury report to the House Judiciary Committee, which was then considering possible grounds to impeach President Nixon.

In his dissent, Judge Srinivasan maintained that Haldeman should control. Judges Ginsburg and Katsas disagreed, relating that the lower and appellate courts in Haldeman failed to conduct any “meaningful analysis of Rule 6(e)’s terms”; they merely offered policy arguments in favor of disclosure — with Sirica, for example, suggesting that disclosure to the House of Representatives was analogous to disclosure to another grand jury (the rule allows the latter). Moreover, Haldeman was distinguishable, the majority reasoned, because the disclosure of the grand-jury report was technically done within the context of the criminal case against H. R. Haldeman and his co-defendant, Gordon Strachan; that is, it was not a direct transmission to the House.

(For what it’s worth, I believe Haldeman is distinguishable for an additional reason: The grand jury in that case was operating under a statute that permitted it to file a report, as distinguished from an indictment, which the grand jury itself recommended be transmitted to the House. I described such reports nearly two years ago, when we first learned that Mueller had convened a grand jury; and Kim Strassel had an excellent Twitter thread about them earlier this week, specifically addressing Haldeman. Such grand-jury reports are very different from what is at issue in the Mueller report. The latter is a prosecutor’s report based, in part, on grand-jury evidence; there are no grand-jury findings or recommendations that its proceedings be transmitted to Congress; and Democrats are asking for all the grand-jury information, with no view expressed by the grand jury or the witnesses who would be affected. The panel majority, however, did not address these differences — no doubt because the Mueller report was not under consideration in the McKeever case.)

It is foreseeable that McKeever could be further appealed, to the full D.C. Circuit (an en banc review) and to the Supreme Court. Not only was the panel divided, but there is a split in the circuits — which the panel majority acknowledges, discussing the relevant cases at the conclusion of its opinion. For now, however, McKeever is the law in the D.C. Circuit, where the Mueller investigation took place. Naturally, the Justice Department must follow it — and it is, again, an affirmation of the Justice Department’s position on the law.

This means Attorney General Barr must redact grand-jury material from the Mueller report before disclosing it to Congress. Democrats will complain long and loud about this, but I don’t see how Barr can be reasonably faulted for following the law.

WASHINGTON – Members of Congress continued to wait Sunday for Attorney General William Barr to provide a summary of conclusions from a nearly two-year investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Barr told lawmakers on Friday he could release the findings as soon as this weekend.

Waiting for the Mueller report:Justice Department could reveal conclusions of Russia inquiry on Sunday

Mueller report:Here's what we know and still don't know (and may never know)

Despite the findings, Democrats have vowed to continue their own investigations.

Republicans criticized the Democrat's ongoing probes, saying the focus of the Mueller investigation was to determine whether there was conspiracy or collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia to impact the 2016 election.

""We’ve not seen any of that,"" Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the House Oversight Committee, also said on ABC’s ""This Week.""

""He is the best person we can pick. He’s right next to Jesus. He can almost walk on water,"" Jordan said. ""He will have the definitive statement on that fundamental question … but all indications are that there’s not going to be any findings of any collusion whatsoever.""

House Democratic leaders held a conference call with members Saturday afternoon urging members to press for access to the report.

Leaders of key House committees led by Democrats said Sunday investigations will continue, including one looking into Trump's finances and other aspects of his presidency.

The House Judiciary Committee recently launched an investigation into whether Trump sought to obstruct justice or misuse his powers, requesting documents from 81 ""agencies, entities, and individuals"" connected to the administration and Trump's private businesses.

The House Intelligence Committee announced it will look into Russian interference in the 2016 election as well as Trump’s foreign financial interests.

""They don’t think this Mueller’s report is going to be the bombshell they all anticipated it was going to be so now they’re launching all kinds of other charges, all kinds of other investigations,"" Jordan said,

Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican, agreed.

""If anyone thinks that the Mueller report being concluded is the end of the Democrats’ attempt to take down President Trump, they haven’t been paying attention the last two years,"" he said on CNN’s ""State of the Union.""

russia,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/2018/4/4/17198588/mueller-trump-russia-criminal-target-investigation,"Mueller is investigating Trump, whether he’s a “criminal target” or not",2018-04-04,"Zachary Fryer-Biggs, Sigal Samuel, Terry Nguyen, Rebecca Jennings, Hannah Brown, Lauren Katz, Theodore Schleifer","Special counsel Robert Mueller reportedly told President Trump ’ s legal team in March that the president is not a “ criminal target ” of the Russia investigation and merely a “ subject ” in the probe .
That may make Trump feel safe — but according to legal experts , Mueller is still clearly investigating Trump .
“ Target ” is a specific legal term ; it refers to someone who investigators believe committed a crime and whom they are likely planning to bring charges against . Calling Trump a “ subject ” of the investigation , however , means that Mueller is looking into Trump ’ s conduct for evidence of a crime but has no plans to bring charges imminently .
“ Being a subject is better than being a target of criminal investigation by a federal grand jury , but it is cold comfort , ” said Andrew Wright , a professor at Savannah Law School . “ In effect , Robert Mueller told the Trump legal team that he is investigating the president ’ s conduct but has not determined as yet whether the president has committed specific federal crimes . ”
So this isn ’ t evidence that Trump is out of the woods when it comes to the Russia investigation . In fact , it confirms the opposite .
It ’ s important to keep in mind the context of the “ criminal target ” comments , which came over the terms of a potential Mueller interview of Trump under oath . Mueller ’ s staff told Trump ’ s legal team that they want to ask Trump about why he fired FBI Director James Comey and what Trump knew about contacts between his team and Russian officials .
Trump himself reportedly wants to sit down with Mueller ’ s staff , and his legal team is divided over whether it ’ s a good idea . Saying that Trump isn ’ t a target doesn ’ t hamper Mueller ’ s investigation into his conduct , and might raise the odds of Trump agreeing to an interview .
“ It ’ s important to stress the fluidity between categories , ” Miriam Baer , a law professor at Brooklyn Law school and a former federal prosecutor , told me in an email . “ Depending on the prosecutor ’ s case , a subject can very quickly become a target ( and although less likely , a target might for some reason morph back into a subject ) . ”
It ’ s also possible that Mueller sees Trump as a subject rather than target because he has concluded he literally can not indict Trump .
White House lawyers have argued since the Nixon administration that the president can ’ t face criminal charges because it would interfere with his or her ability to run the country . Legal experts disagree on whether this is correct , but many believe that Mueller wouldn ’ t risk testing this theory in court . The target of an investigation is likely to face charges , and Mueller could decide that Trump could never be a target while in office .
“ Mueller may believe that he can not currently indict Trump no matter how much evidence he has against him , ” Jens David Ohlin , a professor of law at Cornell , told me . “ Designating him a ‘ subject ’ as opposed to a ‘ target ’ may reflect nothing more than the fact that Trump is the current occupant of the Oval Office . ”
Mueller reportedly insisted that he needs to interview Trump before he can finish his investigation , but Trump ’ s lawyers have hesitated to allow Trump to testify , partially based on Trump ’ s history .
Trump sued journalist Timothy O ’ Brien for statements in his 2005 book TrumpNation , which claimed that Trump was only worth about $ 250 million . Trump disputed that number , saying he was worth billions . Eventually , O ’ Brien ’ s lawyers forced Trump to sit for a deposition in 2007 .
O ’ Brien ’ s lawyers caught Trump lying 30 times , acknowledging that he ’ d repeatedly exaggerated or outright misrepresented facts about his business in the past . At times he tried to exaggerate during the deposition as well , claiming that he charged $ 250,000 for membership to a golf club when he only charged $ 200,000 .
The writer won the case , and it ’ s a reminder that Trump might have a hard time avoiding exaggerations or lies during testimony for the Russia investigation . Thus far Mueller has charged five people with lying during interviews with the FBI , including Alex van der Zwaan , who on Tuesday received a one-month sentence for lying . Even if Mueller can ’ t charge Trump criminally , lying under oath is exactly what got Bill Clinton impeached .","Special counsel Robert Mueller reportedly told President Trump’s legal team in March that the president is not a “criminal target” of the Russia investigation and merely a “subject” in the probe.

“Target” is a specific legal term; it refers to someone who investigators believe committed a crime and whom they are likely planning to bring charges against.

So this isn’t evidence that Trump is out of the woods when it comes to the Russia investigation. In fact, it confirms the opposite.

Why Trump isn’t a “criminal target”

It’s important to keep in mind the context of the “criminal target” comments, which came over the terms of a potential Mueller interview of Trump under oath. Mueller’s staff told Trump’s legal team that they want to ask Trump about why he fired FBI Director James Comey and what Trump knew about contacts between his team and Russian officials.

Trump himself reportedly wants to sit down with Mueller’s staff, and his legal team is divided over whether it’s a good idea. Saying that Trump isn’t a target doesn’t hamper Mueller’s investigation into his conduct, and might raise the odds of Trump agreeing to an interview.

“It’s important to stress the fluidity between categories,” Miriam Baer, a law professor at Brooklyn Law school and a former federal prosecutor, told me in an email. “Depending on the prosecutor’s case, a subject can very quickly become a target (and although less likely, a target might for some reason morph back into a subject).”

It’s also possible that Mueller sees Trump as a subject rather than target because he has concluded he literally cannot indict Trump.

White House lawyers have argued since the Nixon administration that the president can’t face criminal charges because it would interfere with his or her ability to run the country. Legal experts disagree on whether this is correct, but many believe that Mueller wouldn’t risk testing this theory in court. The target of an investigation is likely to face charges, and Mueller could decide that Trump could never be a target while in office.

“Mueller may believe that he cannot currently indict Trump no matter how much evidence he has against him,” Jens David Ohlin, a professor of law at Cornell, told me. “Designating him a ‘subject’ as opposed to a ‘target’ may reflect nothing more than the fact that Trump is the current occupant of the Oval Office.”

Mueller reportedly insisted that he needs to interview Trump before he can finish his investigation, but Trump’s lawyers have hesitated to allow Trump to testify, partially based on Trump’s history.

Trump sued journalist Timothy O’Brien for statements in his 2005 book TrumpNation, which claimed that Trump was only worth about $250 million. Trump disputed that number, saying he was worth billions. Eventually, O’Brien’s lawyers forced Trump to sit for a deposition in 2007.

O’Brien’s lawyers caught Trump lying 30 times, acknowledging that he’d repeatedly exaggerated or outright misrepresented facts about his business in the past. At times he tried to exaggerate during the deposition as well, claiming that he charged $250,000 for membership to a golf club when he only charged $200,000.

The writer won the case, and it’s a reminder that Trump might have a hard time avoiding exaggerations or lies during testimony for the Russia investigation. Thus far Mueller has charged five people with lying during interviews with the FBI, including Alex van der Zwaan, who on Tuesday received a one-month sentence for lying. Even if Mueller can’t charge Trump criminally, lying under oath is exactly what got Bill Clinton impeached.",www.vox.com,left,FBaA9UC2lCP7ts8S

The first big interview with the fired FBI director James Comey is blazing toward a broadcast on Sunday night, but for the Donald Trump presidency, multiple meteors have already hit.

In Comey’s book, A Higher Loyalty, obtained by the Guardian on Thursday from a bookseller in New York before publication, the former official casts Trump as both “unethical” and “untethered to truth” and compares his presidency to a “forest fire”.

Likening Trump to a mafia boss, Comey describes a meeting in the Oval Office which gave him flashbacks to his career as a young prosecutor.

“As I found myself thrust into the Trump orbit, I once again was having flashbacks to my earlier career as a prosecutor against the Mob,” Comey writes. “The silent circle of assent. The boss in complete control. The loyalty oaths. The us-versus-them worldview. The lying about all things, large and small, in service to some code of loyalty that put the organization above morality and the truth.”

The Republican party has launched a concerted effort to get its rebuttal in before the book is published, with a Trumpian web site dedicated to branding the former director “Lyin’ Comey”.

But A Higher Loyalty is an instant bestseller online and will be supported by a media blitz to begin Sunday night with an hour-long broadcast on ABC News.

Trump called Comey a “weak and untruthful slime ball” on Friday in a Twitter response to the first reports from the book.

But Comey is not the only former FBI chief giving Trump a migraine – the special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible Russian collusion with the Trump campaign has been accelerating and is also enraging the president.

The sky began to fall in for Trump on Monday, when FBI agents raided the offices and a hotel room used by Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen. The raids were a strong sign that prosecutors might soon charge one of Trump’s fiercest loyalists with a serious crime or crimes, legal experts said.



“It’s a disgraceful situation,” Trump said. “It’s a total witch-hunt … It’s an attack on our country, what we all stand for.”

As the implications of those raids continue to sink in, Trump may be lured towards the kind of drastic action that would send fissures through the executive branch and beyond, multiple former White House and justice department officials interviewed by the Guardian said.



“The raid of Michael Cohen’s office was a seismic event, for any presidency,” said Andrew Wright, a former White House associate counsel and a professor at Savannah Law School. “I think he [Cohen] is in very serious trouble.

“And sure enough, the president appears to have really come pretty unhinged at that news, so I think that’s incredibly significant.”

Even for a White House that can seem to cycle from crisis to extreme crisis, the current pressure on Trump, and the resulting peril for his presidency and the country, is acute, according to seasoned prosecutors.

“The pressure on the president is actually unimaginable to me,” said Betsy de la Vega, who was a federal prosecutor for more than 20 years.

While the public has no way of knowing how far along Mueller is in his work, De la Vega said, the decision to conduct the Cohen raids, given their high stakes, could indicate that prosecutors had completed significant work behind the scenes.



“They would have to know that setting it in motion would cause great consternation, to say the least, on the part of Donald Trump and his pals, so that gives me the sense that the pace is increasing.”

Cohen, who has denied all wrongdoing, could face charges including bank fraud, wire fraud, campaign violations, tax crimes or other charges relating to payments made to multiple women in advance of the 2016 election, and communications thereafter with at least one of those women.



The prospect of such an indictment is clearly weighing on the president’s mind. In the week since the Cohen raids, Trump has lashed out at Mueller and his superior, the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein.

“Mueller is most conflicted of all (except Rosenstein...),” Trump tweeted in a Wednesday morning tirade against “the Fake & Corrupt Russia Investigation, headed up by the all Democrat loyalists, or people that worked for Obama”.

Mueller has indicted or reached plea agreements with 19 individuals, including four former senior Trump campaign aides, plus three companies in Russia. He is a Republican, as is Rosenstein. So are Comey and Jeff Sessions, the attorney general.

`` I accept our intelligence community 's conclusion that Russia 's meddling in the 2016 election took place – could be other people also , '' Trump said at the White House .
Trump spoke before a meeting with Republican members of the House Ways and Means Committee a day after he faced bipartisan criticism for pro-Putin comments at Monday 's summit in Helsinki .
The president said both the United States and Russia were to blame for frosty relations , and he accepted Putin 's denial of Moscow 's interference in the election despite the conclusions of the U.S. intelligence community .
`` I have great confidence in my intelligence people , '' Trump said Monday in Helsinki with the Russian president at his side , `` but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today . ''
Trump said he reviewed a video of his remarks with Putin after seeing the negative attention they received . He said that he misspoke during the news conference and that he meant to say he saw no reason why it `` would n't '' be Russia that interfered in the election .
Citing `` a key sentence in my remarks , '' Trump said , `` I said the word 'would ' instead of 'would n't . ' ... The sentence should have been ' I do n't see any reason why I would n't , ' or 'why it would n't be Russia . ' ``
According to the news conference transcript , Trump said , `` I have President Putin ; he just said it ’ s not Russia .
`` I will say this : I don ’ t see any reason why it would be , but I really do want to see the server . ''
Trump said Russian activity had `` no impact at all '' on his Electoral College victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton .

Earlier Tuesday , Trump blamed the media for misinterpreting his remarks in Helsinki and defended the Putin news conference by citing the thoughts of a rare supporter who stuck up for him : Sen. Rand Paul .
`` Thank you @ RandPaul , you really get it ! '' Trump tweeted , citing a comment by the Kentuckian that `` the President has gone through a year and a half of totally partisan investigations – what ’ s he supposed to think ? ”
Paul was one of the few Republicans to defend the president after he accepted Putin 's denials that Russia interfered in the 2016 election , despite the conclusions of U.S. intelligence officials that Russians hacked Democratic officials and pushed phony news to help Trump .
Trump condemned the investigation of Russia as a `` disaster '' driving a wedge between the countries .
Rep. Andy Harris , R-Md. , said reporters at the press conference in Helsinki should have asked about “ real issues , ” such as nuclear proliferation and relations with China , rather than election meddling or whether the Russian government had compromising intelligence on Trump .
`` That 's not the way the press ought to conduct itself , '' he said .
Rep. Warren Davidson , R-Ohio , said the press conference was n't Trump 's `` finest hour , ” but he gave the president credit for having a dialogue with Putin and creating the possibility of a better relationship with Russia .
“ We should judge more about the deeds and less about the words , ” he said .
The Putin news conference capped off a European trip in which Trump criticized NATO and described the European Union as a `` foe . ''
Republicans said Putin has long sought to divide Western countries he sees as rivals and Trump 's comments played into that agenda .
McConnell refused to critique Trump 's performance , but the Senate Republican leader said on Capitol Hill that he wants to deliver a message from Congress to NATO and the EU : U.S. allies are well aware of the threat from Moscow .
In both houses of Congress , Republicans blasted the Trump-Putin summit and distanced themselves from Trump 's assertion that both the United States and Moscow were to blame for international friction .
Pushing back against the White House in unusually strong terms , House Speaker Paul Ryan , R-Wis. , described Putin ’ s Russia as a “ menacing government ” and said he had no doubt that the Kremlin attempted to influence the outcome of the election .
“ Russia is trying to undermine democracy itself , to de-legitimize democracy , so for some reason , they can look good by comparison , ” Ryan said .
Trump defended his meeting with Putin during his comments at the White House , saying he and his Russian counterpart discussed ways to reduce the number of nuclear weapons . Trump described his meeting with Putin as “ our most successful visit ” of the European tour last week .
Less than a week ago , special counsel Robert Mueller indicted a dozen Russians on charges involving election interference .
Mueller 's team is investigating whether there are links between Russian hackers and Trump 's presidential campaign . Trump denied any sort of collusion .
He repeated that Tuesday : `` There was no collusion at all . ''
`` Whoops , they just turned off the lights – that must be the intelligence agencies , '' Trump joked .

WASHINGTON – Seeking to quell the furor over his support of Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he accepts the U.S. intelligence community's assessment that Russians interfered with the 2016 election – but that others could have been involved as well.

""I accept our intelligence community's conclusion that Russia's meddling in the 2016 election took place – could be other people also,"" Trump said at the White House.

""A lot of people out there,"" he said.

Trump spoke before a meeting with Republican members of the House Ways and Means Committee a day after he faced bipartisan criticism for pro-Putin comments at Monday's summit in Helsinki.

The president said both the United States and Russia were to blame for frosty relations, and he accepted Putin's denial of Moscow's interference in the election despite the conclusions of the U.S. intelligence community.

""I have great confidence in my intelligence people,"" Trump said Monday in Helsinki with the Russian president at his side, ""but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today.""

Trump said he reviewed a video of his remarks with Putin after seeing the negative attention they received. He said that he misspoke during the news conference and that he meant to say he saw no reason why it ""wouldn't"" be Russia that interfered in the election.

Citing ""a key sentence in my remarks,"" Trump said, ""I said the word 'would' instead of 'wouldn't.' ... The sentence should have been 'I don't see any reason why I wouldn't,' or 'why it wouldn't be Russia.' ""

According to the news conference transcript, Trump said, ""I have President Putin; he just said it’s not Russia.

""I will say this: I don’t see any reason why it would be, but I really do want to see the server.""

Trump said Russian activity had ""no impact at all"" on his Electoral College victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton.

Trump's critics showed no signs of backing down.

Lawmakers from both parties discussed possible legislation to counter some of the president's moves, ranging from restricting tariff authority to placing more sanctions on Russia if it interferes with the 2018 congressional elections or the 2020 presidential contest.

""We understand the Russian threat, and I think that is the widespread view here in the United States Senate among members of both parties,"" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., in discussing possible sanctions legislation against Putin's government.

“It really better not happen again in 2018,"" he said later.

Trump said his administration is doing ""everything in our power"" to prevent Russian interference in the 2018 balloting, and ""we have a lot of power.""

Congressional Democrats mocked what Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer of New York described as Trump's attempt to ""squirm away"" from his Monday comments. ""If the president can’t say directly to President Putin that he is wrong and we are right and our intelligence agencies are right, it’s ineffective, and worse, another sign of weakness,"" Schumer said.

Democrats, and some Republicans, want to know what Trump and Putin discussed in secret for about two hours Monday.

The Russian Defense Ministry announced Tuesday it is ready to implement an international security agreement Putin and Trump reached, but it did not specify what it was.

Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., who joked that Putin probably celebrated the Trump meeting with caviar, applauded the bipartisan criticism of the American president.

""As the president taxes Americans with tariffs, he pushes away our allies and further strengthens Putin,"" tweeted Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations committee. ""It is time for Congress to step up and take back our authorities.""

Earlier Tuesday, Trump blamed the media for misinterpreting his remarks in Helsinki and defended the Putin news conference by citing the thoughts of a rare supporter who stuck up for him: Sen. Rand Paul.

""Thank you @RandPaul, you really get it!"" Trump tweeted, citing a comment by the Kentuckian that ""the President has gone through a year and a half of totally partisan investigations – what’s he supposed to think?”

Paul was one of the few Republicans to defend the president after he accepted Putin's denials that Russia interfered in the 2016 election, despite the conclusions of U.S. intelligence officials that Russians hacked Democratic officials and pushed phony news to help Trump.

Trump condemned the investigation of Russia as a ""disaster"" driving a wedge between the countries.

Other conservatives came to Trump's defense Tuesday.

Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., said reporters at the press conference in Helsinki should have asked about “real issues,” such as nuclear proliferation and relations with China, rather than election meddling or whether the Russian government had compromising intelligence on Trump.

""That's not the way the press ought to conduct itself,"" he said.

Rep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, said the press conference wasn't Trump's ""finest hour,” but he gave the president credit for having a dialogue with Putin and creating the possibility of a better relationship with Russia.

“We should judge more about the deeds and less about the words,” he said.

The Putin news conference capped off a European trip in which Trump criticized NATO and described the European Union as a ""foe.""

Republicans said Putin has long sought to divide Western countries he sees as rivals and Trump's comments played into that agenda.

McConnell refused to critique Trump's performance, but the Senate Republican leader said on Capitol Hill that he wants to deliver a message from Congress to NATO and the EU: U.S. allies are well aware of the threat from Moscow.

In both houses of Congress, Republicans blasted the Trump-Putin summit and distanced themselves from Trump's assertion that both the United States and Moscow were to blame for international friction.

Pushing back against the White House in unusually strong terms, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., described Putin’s Russia as a “menacing government” and said he had no doubt that the Kremlin attempted to influence the outcome of the election.

“Russia is trying to undermine democracy itself, to de-legitimize democracy, so for some reason, they can look good by comparison,” Ryan said.

Trump defended his meeting with Putin during his comments at the White House, saying he and his Russian counterpart discussed ways to reduce the number of nuclear weapons. Trump described his meeting with Putin as “our most successful visit” of the European tour last week.

Less than a week ago, special counsel Robert Mueller indicted a dozen Russians on charges involving election interference.

Mueller's team is investigating whether there are links between Russian hackers and Trump's presidential campaign. Trump denied any sort of collusion.

He repeated that Tuesday: ""There was no collusion at all.""

The lights in the Cabinet Room went out momentarily.

""Whoops, they just turned off the lights – that must be the intelligence agencies,"" Trump joked.

As the lights flicked back on, he said, ""There we go, OK? You guys OK? Good. ... That was strange.""

President's political nightmare worsens

Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington

Up until now, Michael Cohen had been a tangential figure in Donald Trump's Russia-related headaches. After his plea agreement with the special counsel's office, however, he's now smack dab in the middle of Robert Mueller's probe.

In particular, Cohen is sharing information with the special counsel about Mr Trump's Russian business interests - including efforts to build a Trump Tower in Moscow - which, according to the president's former personal lawyer, continued well into Mr Trump's presidential campaign.

That runs counter to the president's continued insistence that he had no financial ties to Russia - an assertion he frequently made when questioned about his past praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin and efforts to improve US-Russian relations.

If Cohen can provide evidence supporting his claims, it would be a political nightmare for the president and, if Mr Trump made false claims in his recent written testimony to Mr Mueller, a legal one, as well.

The president has been tweeting furiously about the special counsel team in recent days, and given the steady drumbeat of news on Mr Mueller's investigation, it feels as though a crescendo is approaching.

What did President Trump say?

As he left the White House for a G20 summit in Buenos Aires, Mr Trump told reporters of Cohen: ""He's a weak person and not a very smart person.

""He's got himself a big prison sentence. And he's trying to get a much lesser prison sentence by making up this story.""

Russian President Vladimir Putin — the country's longest-serving leader since former Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin — scored a victory in Sunday's election allowing him another six-year term.

Putin's re-election was widely expected, and elections officials had pushed hard for a strong turnout to claim an indisputable mandate. Putin has been president or prime minister since December 1999, making him the only leader that a generation of Russians has ever known.

The final election results Monday showed that Putin won 76.6% of the vote, his highest score ever.

Putin thanked thousands of people who rallied near Red Square after the vote. He hailed those who voted for him as a “big national team,” adding that “we are bound for success.”

He said the nation needs unity to move forward and urged the crowd to “think about the future of our great motherland.” He then led the enthusiastic crowd to chant “Russia!” the Associated Press reported.

Putin, in his speech, also dismissed British accusations of Russia’s involvement in an ex-spy’s poisoning as “nonsense,” adding that Moscow is ready to cooperate with London in the probe.

He referred to the March 4 attack on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter as a “tragedy.” He also said if the British claim that they were poisoned by a Soviet-designed nerve agent were true, the victims would have died instantly. They remain hospitalized in serious condition.

Earlier Sunday, there were widespread reports of ballot-box stuffing and forced voting, but complaints of voting irregularities will likely do little to undermine Putin, according to the AP.

Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who was barred from running against Putin, said he boycotted the election and had urged supporters not to vote because of the absence of any real competition, despite seven other names on the ballot. Navalny was prevented from running because of a criminal conviction widely viewed as politically motivated.

Putin's re-election comes amid rising tension with the West, particularly with the United Kingdom, which last week accused Russia of using a nerve agent to poison the former spy and his daughter living in England. In addition, U.S. federal prosecutors are investigating whether Russian-linked groups interfered during the 2016 presidential election.

Russia's election monitors reported irregularities at voting stations across country, even though authorities were under orders to ensure that the voting was free and fair after violations marred Putin's last election in 2012. Putin had faced a serious opposition movement then but has since boosted his popularity with Russia's actions in Ukraine and Syria.

The English-language Moscow Times newspaper marked the election with a series of stories on young people it dubbed “Generation P,” highlighting some of the 1.3 million people born the year Putin first became president.

Putin was first named president in late 1999 after the resignation of Boris Yeltsin and was elected to two terms. In 2008 he was replaced by Dmitry Medvedev, who named him prime minister, and then Putin was again elected president in 2012.

The eight presidential candidates were barred from campaigning Sunday, but much-loved entertainers appealed to voters in a televised message aired throughout the day to fulfill their civic duty and go to the polls. Voters also faced billboards celebrating Russian greatness — a major theme of Putin's leadership.

Putin has traveled across Russia pledging to raise wages, pour more funds into the country's crumbling health care and education and modernize dilapidated infrastructure.

Yevgeny Roizman, the mayor of Russia's fourth-largest city, Yekaterinburg, told the Associated Press that local officials and state employees have all received orders ""from higher up"" to make sure the presidential vote turnout is over 60%.

""They are using everything: schools, kindergartens, hospitals — the battle for the turnout is unprecedented,"" said Roizman, one of the rare opposition politicians to hold a significant elected office.

Authorities also appealed to patriotic feelings by holding the vote on the anniversary of Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. Polls show that most Russians see the takeover of that Black Sea peninsula as a major achievement despite subsequent Western sanctions.

Turnout-boosting efforts have been the most visible feature of the campaign. In Moscow, authorities spent $870,000 on balloons and decorations at polling stations. In Moscow, first-time voters were given free tickets for pop concerts, and health authorities offered free cancer screenings at selected polling stations. In the southern city of Tambov, the state-sponsored Youth Parliament backed an Instagram competition. Voters who took selfies at polling stations could enter a raffle for high-end electronics, including an iPhone X.

A former senior State Department official said there ’ s a high likelihood that the Russians pushed Trump ’ s transition team to set up clandestine communications — and that Trump ’ s aides should have said no .
“ Invariably , foreign governments will try to establish a continuing contact with a new president-elect as soon as the November election result is in , ” said the official , who asked not to be named because of the official ’ s past communications with Trump ’ s team . “ My advice has been to respond , ‘ Thanks a lot , we look forward to being in touch with you after January 20th . ’ ”
The new allegations add to the deepening scandal regarding Trump and ties between his campaign and Russian leaders , who have been accused by U.S. intelligence officials of trying to tip the election Trump ’ s way .
While much of the attention has been on former national security adviser Michael Flynn , increased scrutiny is being placed on Kushner , who reportedly failed to disclose the extent of his contacts with Russian officials during and after the campaign .
But the allegation that Kushner — with Flynn in the room — discussed setting up clandestine communications with Russian officials during the transition marks one of the most potentially damaging accusations to date .
National security officials who worked in the administration of President Barack Obama were particularly concerned by the reports , which suggest Trump ’ s aides were trying to avoid having Obama officials overhear their conversations with the Russians .
“ What could the Trump transition team not have the U.S. government hear them saying ? ” said Ned Price , a former CIA officer and National Security Council spokesman in the Obama administration . “ Obviously , this is improper and may have been illegal . … You don ’ t have an innocuous explanation for this . You can ’ t attribute this to carelessness . ”
Evelyn Farkas , deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia , Ukraine and Eurasia Obama administration , said : “ The fact that they would want to hide it not just from the U.S. public but the U.S. government is unusual , and then they would want to embed the channel inside the Russian intelligence apparatus , if true , is entirely shocking and unprecedented . It ’ s beyond improper . ”
It ’ s unclear what the consequences could be for Kushner and others if the reports are proved true . At a minimum , the allegations pose a major political problem that could endanger Kushner ’ s White House role and could fuel impeachment talk for Trump .
On the more severe side , such communications could test the Logan Act , a largely dormant statute that bans private citizens from interfering with U.S. diplomatic relations .
In general , back-channel communication between heads of state and their surrogates has a long history , but what sets this situation apart is that the discussions allegedly took place before Trump took office and were meant to circumvent the official channels of the administration that remained in power .
“ Back channels are a tried-and-true form of secret diplomacy , ” according to Peter Kornbluh , a researcher at the National Security Archive at George Washington University and co-author of the recent book `` Back Channel to Cuba . ''
For example , “ Bobby Kennedy became personal and trusted emissary of his brother President Kennedy probably at the most critical and dangerous time in modern history , ” during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis with the Soviet Union , he said . “ President Nixon used one in the opening to China . There were back channels to [ Communist leader ] Ho Chi Minh during the Vietnam War . Every president from Eisenhower to Obama used a back channel to approach Fidel Castro in Cuba and his brother Raul . ”
But the key question in this case is when Trump or his aides may have discussed such communications with President Vladimir Putin and other Russian leaders , Kornbluh and others said — and for what purpose .
“ What distinguishes Trump is he wasn ’ t president when they tried to set it up , ” Kornbluh said . “ With the cloud of the Russian scandal hanging over his head , it is not clear why he would want to cut everybody out . The question that is not being posed much by the press so far is whether Kushner and Flynn were acting alone . Usually the president has known about these back channels because he initiated them . ”
Smullen , Powell ’ s former chief of staff , agreed with that analysis .
“ Back channels are very common . People have used them all the time . They can be a safety valve for things that can be explosive , ” said Smullen , who recalled such efforts with the Soviets when he was an aide to Adm. William Crowe , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , during the Cold War .
Smullen added that President Trump has every right to have a back channel , but President-elect Trump would not .
Others urged caution , saying this latest controversy could be part of a more advanced Russian plot , especially because The Washington Post report cited intelligence reports in which Kislyak talked with his superiors about Kushner ’ s alleged proposal .
“ Typically , the Russian clandestine subversion specialists , being the best in the world in this demonical art form , operate in double , triple and sometimes multiple tactical plot lines , ” said the former State Department official . “ For example , in the media report … that the U.S. has intercepted a message from Kislyak to the Kremlin saying that Kushner had proposed a back-channel connection during the transition period , it has to be understood that Kislyak knows perfectly well that all his communications are being intercepted by the U.S . ”","Jared Kushner’s alleged discussions with Russia’s ambassador about potentially establishing back-channel communications during the transition would have been viewed as not only highly improper but also possibly even illegal, according to former national security officials.

President Donald Trump’s team on Saturday tried to downplay reports from The Washington Post and others that Ambassador Sergey Kislyak told his superiors that Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and top adviser, made the proposal during an early December meeting and suggested using Russian diplomatic facilities for the clandestine communications. It appears the back channel was never set up.

“We have back-channel communications with a number of countries,” Trump’s national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, told American reporters traveling with Trump at the G-7 summit in Sicily. “What that allows you to do is communicate in a discreet manner, so I’m not concerned.”

Former national security officials who spoke with POLITICO on Saturday were not so dismissive.

Many said that while presidents often set up back-channel communications with various countries, it’s neither wise nor normal for a president-elect to set up such continuing contact before the inauguration, despite likely pressure from foreign countries.

Also, the idea of using the equipment of a foreign country, especially an adversary such as Russia, would be acutely alarming.

“Invariably, foreign governments will try to establish a continuing contact with a new president-elect as soon as the November election result is in,” said the official, who asked not to be named because of the official’s past communications with Trump’s team. “My advice has been to respond, ‘Thanks a lot, we look forward to being in touch with you after January 20th.’”

The new allegations add to the deepening scandal regarding Trump and ties between his campaign and Russian leaders, who have been accused by U.S. intelligence officials of trying to tip the election Trump’s way.

While much of the attention has been on former national security adviser Michael Flynn, increased scrutiny is being placed on Kushner, who reportedly failed to disclose the extent of his contacts with Russian officials during and after the campaign.

But the allegation that Kushner — with Flynn in the room — discussed setting up clandestine communications with Russian officials during the transition marks one of the most potentially damaging accusations to date.

National security officials who worked in the administration of President Barack Obama were particularly concerned by the reports, which suggest Trump’s aides were trying to avoid having Obama officials overhear their conversations with the Russians.

“What could the Trump transition team not have the U.S. government hear them saying?” said Ned Price, a former CIA officer and National Security Council spokesman in the Obama administration. “Obviously, this is improper and may have been illegal. … You don’t have an innocuous explanation for this. You can’t attribute this to carelessness.”

Evelyn Farkas, deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia Obama administration, said: “The fact that they would want to hide it not just from the U.S. public but the U.S. government is unusual, and then they would want to embed the channel inside the Russian intelligence apparatus, if true, is entirely shocking and unprecedented. It’s beyond improper.”

It’s unclear what the consequences could be for Kushner and others if the reports are proved true. At a minimum, the allegations pose a major political problem that could endanger Kushner’s White House role and could fuel impeachment talk for Trump.

On the more severe side, such communications could test the Logan Act, a largely dormant statute that bans private citizens from interfering with U.S. diplomatic relations.

In general, back-channel communication between heads of state and their surrogates has a long history, but what sets this situation apart is that the discussions allegedly took place before Trump took office and were meant to circumvent the official channels of the administration that remained in power.

“Back channels are a tried-and-true form of secret diplomacy,” according to Peter Kornbluh, a researcher at the National Security Archive at George Washington University and co-author of the recent book ""Back Channel to Cuba.""

For example, “Bobby Kennedy became personal and trusted emissary of his brother President Kennedy probably at the most critical and dangerous time in modern history,” during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis with the Soviet Union, he said. “President Nixon used one in the opening to China. There were back channels to [Communist leader] Ho Chi Minh during the Vietnam War. Every president from Eisenhower to Obama used a back channel to approach Fidel Castro in Cuba and his brother Raul.”

But the key question in this case is when Trump or his aides may have discussed such communications with President Vladimir Putin and other Russian leaders, Kornbluh and others said — and for what purpose.

“What distinguishes Trump is he wasn’t president when they tried to set it up,” Kornbluh said. “With the cloud of the Russian scandal hanging over his head, it is not clear why he would want to cut everybody out. The question that is not being posed much by the press so far is whether Kushner and Flynn were acting alone. Usually the president has known about these back channels because he initiated them.”

Smullen, Powell’s former chief of staff, agreed with that analysis.

“Back channels are very common. People have used them all the time. They can be a safety valve for things that can be explosive,” said Smullen, who recalled such efforts with the Soviets when he was an aide to Adm. William Crowe, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, during the Cold War.

Smullen added that President Trump has every right to have a back channel, but President-elect Trump would not.

Others urged caution, saying this latest controversy could be part of a more advanced Russian plot, especially because The Washington Post report cited intelligence reports in which Kislyak talked with his superiors about Kushner’s alleged proposal.

“Typically, the Russian clandestine subversion specialists, being the best in the world in this demonical art form, operate in double, triple and sometimes multiple tactical plot lines,” said the former State Department official. “For example, in the media report … that the U.S. has intercepted a message from Kislyak to the Kremlin saying that Kushner had proposed a back-channel connection during the transition period, it has to be understood that Kislyak knows perfectly well that all his communications are being intercepted by the U.S.”",www.politico.com,left,wwG1YynuhElQjye1
russia,Christian Science Monitor,1,http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2017/0331/Election-meddling-When-Russia-returns-will-the-US-be-ready,"Election meddling: When Russia returns, will the US be ready?",2017-03-31,Peter Grier,"Allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election have raised lots of questions , from why so many Trump team members met with the Russian ambassador prior to inauguration day , to whether Moscow hacked any key party groups besides the Democratic National Committee .
But there ’ s one crucial uncertainty that ’ s perhaps been lost in the partisan wrangling over Russia ’ s actions : What is the US going to do when they try it again ?
Because Russia is almost certain to repeat its efforts to undermine American voters ’ faith in their electoral system , according to US officials . Why shouldn ’ t it ? The Vladimir Putin regime appears happy with the way covert and overt techniques have worked so far .
Countering this unprecedented attempt at influence may require an equally unprecedented whole-government American response . According to experts , that could involve everything from better cyberdefense and more public exposure of hacking to a US-run debunking website devoted to the exposure of Russia-backed fake news . Common-sense measures at the personal level and efforts to strengthen democratic institutions at the public level also are needed , they say .
“ I do believe it ’ s in our power to stop these Russian tactics , but what it will require is a very focused effort , ” says Heather Conley , Europe program director for the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a co-author of the new report “ Recalibrating US Strategy Toward Russia . ”
In interviews and at hearings and think-tank conferences in Washington this month , officials and experts alike expressed a consensus that so far the known US response to Russian meddling has been limited and not entirely coherent .
Prior to November , the Obama administration seemed reluctant to name and shame Russia for meddling , for fear it would be criticized for attempting to influence the vote itself . Since January , the Trump administration seems most concerned that the subject might undermine the new president ’ s electoral legitimacy .
President Barack Obama did eventually expel dozens of Russian diplomats and impose some sanctions on Russia , while publishing a public summary of the attack on the DNC .
Still , on the whole “ we have no organized response as a country . … Until we set boundaries , they are going to move as far as they can , ” said Clint Watts , a former FBI agent and senior fellow at the Center for Cyber and Homeland Security at George Washington University , at a Senate Select Committee on Intelligence hearing Thursday .
Russia hasn ’ t been bothering to take its shoes off and try to sneak around quietly , either . It ’ s been “ loud ” in its efforts to hack the US election , leaving behind bits of code and other cyber-clues that make it relatively easy to attribute computer break-ins to Russian-linked groups .
This swagger may have been part of the point , said FBI Director James Comey in his March 20 appearance at the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence . Moscow may have counted on the US picking up on the intrusions , publicly informing voters , and subsequently “ freaking people out , ” said the FBI chief .
Given their success , they ’ ll be back to try and affect the 2018 midterms and then return again for the 2020 presidential election , according to Mr. Comey .
“ One of the lessons they may draw from this is that they were successful because they introduced chaos and division and discord and sowed doubt about the nature of this amazing country of ours and our democratic process , ” he said .
The Russian effort for the 2016 vote began ramping up in mid- to late-summer of 2015 , according to experts . It was a hybrid composed of the covert hacking of the DNC and other targets , the dissemination of slanted or completely fake news via such means as automated social media bots , and overt propaganda covered by the state-controlled RT news channel and other Russian media outlets .
US intelligence detailed the hacking effort in declassified reports at the end of 2016 . In sum , two Advanced Persistent cyber-threats deemed linked to Russia , APT28 and APT29 , emailed a malicious link to more than 1,000 recipients , including multiple government officials . At least one person – presumably Clinton campaign chief John Podesta – bit on the link , in part due to faulty information provided by the campaign ’ s tech team .
In the end , Russian hacking groups – also known by nicknames such as “ Fancy Bear ” and “ GeminiDuke ” and “ Eviltoss ” – reportedly got access to sensitive systems at the DNC and elsewhere . They merrily rummaged about , “ likely leading to the exfiltration of information from multiple senior party members , ” according to a joint FBI and Department of Homeland Security report .
This is the origin of much of the stuff that unknown intermediaries passed to WikiLeaks and other outlets for dissemination to the wider world .
“ The US Government assesses that information was leaked to the press and publicly disclosed , ” the report drily notes .
But hacking was only one prong of the effort . Russia also used the older , historic tool of out-and-out fake news and twisted propaganda – albeit disseminated with modern social media methods .
Consider the experience of Sen. Tim Kaine ( D ) of Virginia , Hillary Clinton ’ s running mate . He was the subject of a number of Russia-derived false stories during the campaign . At least three were so silly or unbelievable the mainstream media didn ’ t bother to mention them at all , Senator Kaine said in January at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing .
Out of curiosity he looked at one of the stories on social media to see what kind of reaction it was producing . He was astonished to learn it had been shared 800,000 times .
“ These are stories that most fourth graders would find incredible , ” said Kaine at the HASC meeting .
On the evening of July 30 , 2016 , RT and Sputnik News simultaneously released stories saying , falsely , that the US air base at Incirlik in Turkey was being overrun by terrorists . Russian news aggregators , trolls , and Russia-linked automated social media “ bot ” accounts quickly spread and amplified this story , including the assertion ( also false ) that there were nuclear missiles at the base that would be lost in the incursion .
More than 4,000 tweets in the story ’ s first 78 minutes were from accounts associated with Russian active propaganda measures , according to Clint Watts of the Center for Cyber and Homeland Security . Apparently based in many different places and communities , they used the same hashtags ( # Nuclear ) and keywords to try and spread the notion that a Benghazi-like attack was under way on a much larger scale . In reality , a small protest had simply gathered outside Incirlik ’ s gates .
“ This pattern of Russian falsehoods and social media manipulation of the American electorate continued through Election Day and persists today , ” wrote Mr. Watts in his prepared statement for the March 30 Senate Intelligence hearing . “ Many of the accounts we watched push the false Incirlik story in July now focus their efforts on shaping the upcoming European elections , promoting fears of immigration or false claims of refugee criminality . ”
So that ’ s what the US now faces . It ’ s a combination of old Soviet-era disinformation efforts and powerful modern communications and computer techniques .
Lawmakers and US officials say that countering Russia ’ s attacks on US political integrity will require a comprehensive use of all levels of national power . Cyberdefense is crucial but only part of the equation . Cyber-intrusions should not always be countered with cyber-based weapons .
“ We must engage in a whole-of-government approach to counter Russia ’ s active measures , ” said Sen. Richard Burr ( R ) of North Carolina , chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence , in a public hearing on the subject Thursday .
US operations need to improve in three areas : defense , detection , and deterrence , according to Ben Buchanan , a postdoctoral fellow at the Belfer Center Cybersecurity Project at Harvard University .
On defense , individuals should realize that if they have any kind of national role , their personal accounts might be Russian targets . They need to take basic steps such as two-factor authentication for computer access and activities and password managers so they don ’ t just reuse passwords , says Mr. Buchanan .
At the national policy level the US should spend the money to replace many of its aging legacy systems with systems built with security in mind . President Obama ’ s proposed IT modernization would be a good baseline from which to start , says Buchanan in an email response to a reporter ’ s questions .
On detection , it ’ s important for federal systems to have good network visibility so defenders can spot intruders once they gain access .
“ No perimeter defense is perfect , and security professionals should assume that compromise will happen and focus on detecting and remediating it as fast as possible , ” says Buchanan .
Deterrence could involve a wide range of responses . But the US must act in some manner if its deterrence in this area is to remain credible . “ Naming and shaming ” is perhaps one place to start . Indicting Russian , Chinese , or Iranian hackers would show that the US can determine who is behind intrusions and limit their ability to travel abroad .
Looking at the situation more broadly , the first line of defense should be to strengthen Western democratic institutions , says Ms. Conley of CSIS . After all , Russia ’ s main aim is to weaken US leadership abroad and pull more of Europe into its own sphere of influence . Resisting that requires strong and resilient government .
That could mean more financial transparency , to track illicit Russia-linked money flows into the US and other nations . It could mean more efforts to root out corruption and strengthen the independent judiciary in troubled nations .
“ The Russians are just exploiting weaknesses that exist in our society , ” says Conley . “ We have very low trust factors in our leaders and institutions . This is a long-term rebuilding . ”
Information literacy is a problem , she adds . In today ’ s friend-based news environment , where many people get their news from links sent along by social media , it ’ s much harder to verify truth than it was in the cold war era of three main TV networks .
Perhaps a school or community-based public education effort on the dangers of “ fake news ” is what ’ s needed .
“ How do we get community leaders , civic leaders , school leaders involved ? ” Conley says . “ You have to educate . ”
Some experts have suggested a government-sponsored version of the Snopes debunking website , devoted to exposing Russia-created fake stories and countering Russia ’ s twist on news events . Others push for the restoration of an independent US Information Agency , a cold war era organization that was dedicated to cultural and news outreach in nations subject to Soviet influence .

Many urge the US to do more , whatever it is . The response so far to Russia ’ s active measures of influence hasn ’ t been adequate , they say .
“ It ’ s time the United States reminds the world , that despite our day-to-day policy debates and political squabbles , we stand united , alongside our allies , in defending our democratic system of government , ” said Watts of the Center for Cyber and Homeland Security in his opening statement at Thursday ’ s Senate intelligence hearing .","Allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election have raised lots of questions, from why so many Trump team members met with the Russian ambassador prior to inauguration day, to whether Moscow hacked any key party groups besides the Democratic National Committee.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Sunday that special counsel Robert Mueller should not testify before Congress, abandoning his previous declaration that he would leave that decision to his attorney general.

Escalating tensions with House Democrats as they seek to bring Mueller before the House Judiciary Committee, Trump tweeted: “Bob Mueller should not testify. No redos for the Dems!”

Democrats are seeking more information about Mueller’s report on his Russia investigation. Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has said he doesn’t plan to invite Mueller to testify on the report.

Trump told reporters in the Oval Office last week that testimony from Mueller was “up to our attorney general.” William Barr has said he has no objection to Mueller testifying.

Trump again asserted on Twitter Sunday that Mueller’s report revealed “NO COLLUSION” and argued that there was “NO OBSTRUCTION.”

On collusion, Mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term. He looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between Russia and the Trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front. Mueller didn’t charge Trump with obstruction but wrote that he couldn’t exonerate him, either.

Trump did not indicate if he would take any steps to block Mueller, who is a Justice Department employee.

The president tweeted Sunday after a Democrat on the committee said he was hopeful Mueller would testify, noting that May 15 has been proposed.

Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline told “Fox News Sunday” that “we hope the special counsel will appear” at that time and that “we think the American people have a right to hear directly from him.”

Cicilline later tweeted that “nothing has been agreed to yet.”

The House Judiciary Committee chairman, Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York, said last week the committee was “firming up the date” for Mueller’s testimony and hoping it would be May 15.

Cicilline said on Fox that “obviously until the date comes, we never have an absolute guarantee” and in his tweet later, said that “we hope the Special Counsel” will agree to the proposed date for his testimony.

Spokespeople for the Justice Department and Mueller declined to comment on Cicilline’s remarks and on Trump’s tweet.

Democratic lawmakers expressed their displeasure with Trump’s position. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer tweeted, in part: “Now he’s trying to silence Mueller. For a man who constantly proclaims his innocence, @realDonaldTrump is acting awfully guilty. Mueller must testify publicly before Congress.”

Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, noted in a tweet that Trump’s opposition to Mueller testifying follows his opposition to having a former White House counsel testify.

“Barr’s testimony alone — designed to protect Trump — isn’t going to cut it. They will testify. The American people deserve the truth,” said Schiff, who has previously stated that he would like Mueller to appear before his panel.",www.apnews.com,center,iYWIaRqG5y5mkgAK

The plane was an An-148 , a regional jet belonging to Saratov Airlines , that had taken off from Domodedovo Airport and was headed to Orsk about 1,000 miles southeast of Moscow , REN-TV reported .
The Moscow Inter-Regional Transport Prosecutor 's Office said in a statement to Interfax that all people on board the plane have died . `` The plane was carrying 65 passengers and six crewmembers . All of them died , '' the agency said .
Transport Minister Maxim Sokolov added that `` judging by everything , no one has survived this crash . ''
Authorities have found a black box belonging to the aircraft and have cordoned off the area of the crash site , regional head of the Ministry of Emergency Situations Sergei Poletykin said in a conference call .
`` One recorder was found at the crash site , '' Poletykin said .
The crew of the doomed aircraft did not report any malfunctions , Svetlana Petrenko , an official representative of the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation , told Interfax .
`` At the moment it has been established that there have been no reports of aircraft failure from the crew , '' Petrenko said .

Mueller ’ s indictment is an ineffectual response to a provocation by Russia .

To the contrary , we use counterintelligence rather than criminal investigation to thwart foreign adversaries because prosecution is a woefully inadequate response . The point of counterintelligence is to gather information so we can stop our enemies , through meaningful retaliation and discouragement .

That can not be accomplished by a mere indictment on which no one will be tried .
When prosecutors are serious about nabbing law-breakers who are at large , they do not file an indictment publicly . That would just induce the offenders to flee to or remain in their safe havens .

In the Russia case , however , the indictment was filed publicly even though the defendants are at large . That is because the Justice Department and the special counsel know the Russians will stay safely in Russia .
Mueller ’ s allegations will never be tested in court . That makes his indictment more a political statement than a charging instrument . To the extent there are questions about whether Russia truly meddled in the election , the special counsel wants to end that discussion ( although his indictment will not satisfy those skeptical about Russia ’ s responsibility for hacking Democratic accounts , or who wonder why the FBI and Justice Department never physically examined DNC servers ) . Otherwise , the indictment demonstrates that the special counsel has been hard at work . That is as it should be . Through all the months of public debate over whether there was criminal-collusion evidence against the president , we have stressed that the main focus of the counterintelligence investigation is the Kremlin , not the White House . It is good , then , that Russia has gotten so much of the special counsel ’ s attention .
What is not good is that he is a special counsel as opposed to , say , a high-ranking intelligence or defense official . It is only natural that a prosecutor sees his job as making a criminal case , but that is not really what is called for under the circumstances .
Obviously , if there were strong evidence that Americans had aided and abetted our foreign adversaries in their hostile acts , it would be essential to prosecute them . My objection has been that a special counsel was assigned despite the absence of strong evidence that crimes were committed by Trump-campaign figures . It is freely conceded that I do not favor special-counsel appointments except when a severe Justice Department conflict of interest leaves no other option . Thus , I do not see why a special counsel would have been needed for any Russia case involving suspects unconnected to the Trump campaign . But all that said , I have never contended that the assignment of a Justice Department prosecutor would be inappropriate if there were concrete grounds to believe Americans were guilty of crimes .
Nevertheless , we are talking now about the foreign adversary . The Justice Department ’ s comments Friday elucidated that information warfare is being orchestrated by Russia — i.e. , the regime — not a random bunch of Russians . As we ’ ve stressed over the years in connection with many terrorism indictments , if a foreign power is engaged in warfare against the United States , an indictment is not a serious response — especially an indictment on which no one is ever going to be prosecuted . Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein suggested on Friday that , with formal charges now filed , the Justice Department will turn to the next step in the legal process : seeking the defendants ’ extradition . Once the Russians stop laughing , I imagine they ’ ll send us a curt note in Cyrillic — or maybe they ’ ll just flip us the bird , the universal language .
There are reasons besides ineffectiveness to be concerned about turning this diplomatic dispute into a criminal-justice issue .
This is a dangerous game to play . Our government , American organizations , and individual Americans regularly take actions and engage in political expression ( including pseudonymous expression ) with the intention of affecting foreign political campaigns — or that could be understood that way regardless of American intent . In its lead story on Mueller ’ s indictment , the New York Times observes that “ for decades , ” the CIA has “ work [ ed ] covertly to influence political outcomes abroad. ” The Obama administration , on the American taxpayer ’ s dime , tried to get Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu defeated and agitated against Brexit .

A government lawyer is a hammer who sees every problem as the nail of a lawsuit. As we saw in the Clinton and Obama years (and will tend to see in transnational-progressive governments that prize legal processes over the pursuit of national interests by the most effective means available), administrations dominated by government lawyers find even belligerent provocations by a foreign power to be fit for judicial resolution.

Giuliani refuted speculation Sunday that White House counsel Donald McGahn had flipped on President Trump , accusing “ desperate ” investigators of leaking information about the attorney ’ s cooperation with the special counsel in order to lure the president into a perjury trap .
“ They ’ re down to desperation time , ” Mr. Giuliani said on NBC ’ s “ Meet the Press. ” “ They have to write a report , and they don ’ t have a single bit of evidence . ”
The New York Times , citing multiple unidentified sources , reported Saturday that Mr. McGahn had spent 30 hours over three days answering questions as part of special counsel Robert Mueller ’ s investigation into Russian election interference .
The report fueled comparisons to Nixon White House counsel John Dean ’ s decision to switch sides during the Watergate investigation , but former Trump attorney John Dowd said Mr. McGahn was actually a “ terrific witness ” for the president , dismissing speculation to the contrary as “ pure fiction . ”
“ Pure fiction on claims of pushback by McGahn , ” Mr. Dowd told The ███ . “ Don McGahn was a terrific witness for the president . I debriefed him . ”
Mr. Dowd also defended the Trump administration ’ s open-book legal strategy of providing extensive access to witnesses and documents . He said Mr. Mueller told him that no one lied and no documents were withheld .
SEE ALSO : John Dowd : Don McGahn didn ’ t implicate Trump in Mueller interviews
“ It ’ s worked out fine because now Mueller is empty , ” Mr. Dowd said . “ We ’ ve answered all his questions . … And he ’ s said the president has no exposure . ”
Mr. Giuliani accused the special counsel ’ s office of leaking the report to spur Mr. Trump into testifying , then setting him up for a perjury charge by having him contradict statements by former FBI Director James B. Comey about former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn .
“ I ’ m not going to be rushed into having him testify so that he gets trapped into perjury , ” Mr. Giuliani said . “ When you tell me that he should testify because he ’ s going to tell the truth and he shouldn ’ t worry , well that ’ s so silly , because it ’ s somebody ’ s version of the truth , not the truth . ”
The former New York City mayor wound up in a trap of another sort after he countered host Chuck Todd ’ s assertion that “ truth is truth ” with , “ No , truth isn ’ t truth . ”
“ This is going to be a bad meme , ” said a laughing Mr. Todd , while Mr. Giuliani responded , “ No , don ’ t do this to me . ”
Mr. Giuliani described a situation as a case of he-said , he-said : “ Donald Trump says , ‘ I didn ’ t talk about Flynn with Comey. ’ Comey says , ‘ You did talk about it. ’ So tell me what the truth is . ”
The Times report said Mr. McGahn decided to cooperate fully because he was worried that the president was trying to set him up to take the fall for any obstruction charges by refusing to shield their conversations with executive or attorney-client privilege .
Mr. Trump tweeted Sunday that the story was a “ fake piece , ” that he had “ nothing to hide ” and that his administration was the “ most transparent in history . ”
“ The Failing New York Times wrote a story that made it sound like the White House Councel [ sic ] had TURNED on the President , when in fact it is just the opposite , ” Mr. Trump said in a Sunday tweet , adding , “ This is why the Fake News Media has become the Enemy of the People . So bad for America ! ”
In a statement , the New York Times communications department said the newspaper “ stands behind the reporting of our Pulitzer Prize-winning reporters . ”
McGahn attorney William A. Burck released a statement confirming that his client had cooperated fully .
“ President Trump , through counsel , declined to assert any privilege over Mr. McGahn ’ s testimony , so Mr. McGahn answered the Special Counsel team ’ s questions fulsomely and honestly , as any person interviewed by federal investigators must , ” said the statement .

Giuliani refuted speculation Sunday that White House counsel Donald McGahn had flipped on President Trump, accusing “desperate” investigators of leaking information about the attorney’s cooperation with the special counsel in order to lure the president into a perjury trap.

“They’re down to desperation time,” Mr. Giuliani said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “They have to write a report, and they don’t have a single bit of evidence.”

The New York Times, citing multiple unidentified sources, reported Saturday that Mr. McGahn had spent 30 hours over three days answering questions as part of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian election interference.

The report fueled comparisons to Nixon White House counsel John Dean’s decision to switch sides during the Watergate investigation, but former Trump attorney John Dowd said Mr. McGahn was actually a “terrific witness” for the president, dismissing speculation to the contrary as “pure fiction.”

“Pure fiction on claims of pushback by McGahn,” Mr. Dowd told The Washington Times. “Don McGahn was a terrific witness for the president. I debriefed him.”

Mr. Dowd also defended the Trump administration’s open-book legal strategy of providing extensive access to witnesses and documents. He said Mr. Mueller told him that no one lied and no documents were withheld.

“It’s worked out fine because now Mueller is empty,” Mr. Dowd said. “We’ve answered all his questions. … And he’s said the president has no exposure.”

Mr. Giuliani accused the special counsel’s office of leaking the report to spur Mr. Trump into testifying, then setting him up for a perjury charge by having him contradict statements by former FBI Director James B. Comey about former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.

“I’m not going to be rushed into having him testify so that he gets trapped into perjury,” Mr. Giuliani said. “When you tell me that he should testify because he’s going to tell the truth and he shouldn’t worry, well that’s so silly, because it’s somebody’s version of the truth, not the truth.”

The former New York City mayor wound up in a trap of another sort after he countered host Chuck Todd’s assertion that “truth is truth” with, “No, truth isn’t truth.”

“This is going to be a bad meme,” said a laughing Mr. Todd, while Mr. Giuliani responded, “No, don’t do this to me.”

Mr. Giuliani described a situation as a case of he-said, he-said: “Donald Trump says, ‘I didn’t talk about Flynn with Comey.’ Comey says, ‘You did talk about it.’ So tell me what the truth is.”

The Times report said Mr. McGahn decided to cooperate fully because he was worried that the president was trying to set him up to take the fall for any obstruction charges by refusing to shield their conversations with executive or attorney-client privilege.

Mr. Trump tweeted Sunday that the story was a “fake piece,” that he had “nothing to hide” and that his administration was the “most transparent in history.”

“The Failing New York Times wrote a story that made it sound like the White House Councel [sic] had TURNED on the President, when in fact it is just the opposite,” Mr. Trump said in a Sunday tweet, adding, “This is why the Fake News Media has become the Enemy of the People. So bad for America!”

In a statement, the New York Times communications department said the newspaper “stands behind the reporting of our Pulitzer Prize-winning reporters.”

McGahn attorney William A. Burck released a statement confirming that his client had cooperated fully.

“President Trump, through counsel, declined to assert any privilege over Mr. McGahn’s testimony, so Mr. McGahn answered the Special Counsel team’s questions fulsomely and honestly, as any person interviewed by federal investigators must,” said the statement.

Mr. Giuliani said the president has “encouraged all the people who testified to tell the truth, to take as long as they needed to do that, and as long as they did, they’ll have no problem with the president or us.”

“And we have no reason to believe that Don McGahn didn’t do that,” he added.

He said the leak indicated that the Mueller team is panicking because “they know they don’t have a case, there was no collusion, there was no obstruction, they can’t prove it, and they are trying to get the president to testify,” Mr. Giuliani told Fox’s “Justice with Judge Jeanine.”

“And they’re hoping that if they put out a story like this in which they suggest that McGahn is cooperating against him — but don’t say it, they don’t say that — that he’ll want to come in and explain himself,” said Mr. Giuliani.

He said the president has turned over 1.4 million documents, encouraged more than 30 witnesses including Mr. McGahn to testify, and declined to assert executive privilege as part of his commitment to transparency.

Mr. Trump’s decision to decline to assert executive and attorney-client privilege has come into question, but Mr. Dowd said “it was smarter to be transparent and get the case over with.”

Since being elected president , Donald Trump has vociferously claimed he engaged in “ no collusion ” with Vladimir Putin ’ s attack on the 2016 US election and that the investigation of any interactions between him and his associates and Russians was a “ witch hunt ” or a “ rigged witch hunt. ” Yet his historic Helsinki summit with Putin—and particularly the unsettling joint press conference they held—provided a clear indication that Trump is indeed guilty of one form of collusion : colluding with Putin to cover up Moscow ’ s criminal assault on American democracy .
I ’ ve been making this case for over a year , noting that “ Trump actively and enthusiastically aided and abetted ” Putin ’ s plot against the United States by supporting Moscow ’ s denial that it mounted information warfare that undermined the election and helped Trump . Put aside the notion of whether Trump or anyone in his crew schemed with Russians on how to pull this off . Once the attack became public , Trump and his lieutenants continuously maintained it was nothing but a hoax . When the Democratic National Committee in June 2016 revealed it had been hacked by Russian operatives , the Trump campaign issued a statement huffing , “ We believe it was the DNC that did the ‘ hacking ’ as a way to distract from the many issues facing their deeply flawed candidate and failed party leader. ” After WikiLeaks released over 20,000 DNC emails right before the start of the Democratic convention the following month , the Hillary Clinton campaign tried to make the point this was Russian sabotage . Donald Trump Jr. and Paul Manafort hit the cable news shows to call this claim absurd . ( Yet just weeks earlier , both had attended a secret meeting in Trump Tower with a Russian emissary , after being told this woman was bringing the campaign dirt on Clinton as part of a secret Kremlin plot to assist Trump . )
Trump led the denial charge himself . After being briefed in mid-August by US intelligence that Russia was behind the hack-and-dump operation against the Clinton campaign , he repeatedly declared that there was no reason to suspect Moscow was the culprit . He did this in speeches . And he did this in the debates with Clinton . At their first face-off , he said the perp “ could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds , OK ? ” And following the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence ’ s release of a statement in early October 2016 stating that intelligence showed Russia was indeed behind this attack , Trump still vigorously insisted there was no reason to believe Moscow was involved .
Throughout this period , Russia , of course , was denying it was doing anything untoward . So Trump was echoing Putin ’ s disinformation . He was pushing Moscow ’ s line and dismissing the US government ’ s official finding . That made it easier for Russia to get away with the covert operation . With Trump very publicly challenging the notion that an attack was underway , Republican leaders—most notably , Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) —were disinclined to join the Obama administration in any effort to challenge or thwart Putin ’ s assault on the US political system . Trump provided Putin cover .
He continued to do so after the election . When the US intelligence community in January 2017 released an assessment confirming Russia had engaged in this information warfare and noting that this had been done in part to boost Trump ’ s chances , Trump refused to acknowledge the conclusions or to take clear action against Russia . Rather , he assailed the intelligence community , comparing it to Hitler ’ s regime . ( “ Are we living in Nazi Germany ? ” he tweeted . ) And he stuck with this course through the first year of his presidency . After meeting with Putin at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in November 2017 , Trump told reporters on Air Force One , “ He said he didn ’ t meddle . I asked him again . You can only ask so many times. ” Trump added : “ Every time he sees me , he says , ‘ I didn ’ t do that ’ , but I really believe that when he tells me that , he means it. ” Trump continued , “ I think he ’ s very insulted by it . ”
Even though his administration has taken some actions against Russia—such as expelling Russian diplomats after the nerve agent attack in England—Trump has not stopped amplifying Putin ’ s assertion that Russia is innocent . And he tells his base—all those Fox News watchers—that the investigations are bunk and that the Deep State has manufactured this scandal to nail him . That is , Putin and the Kremlin are not the villains ; the enemy is within .
As Putin has tried to cloak Russian culpability , Trump has been an eager helpmate . In the run-up to the Helsinki meeting , Trump tweeted , “ Russia continues to say they had nothing to do with Meddling in our Election ! ”
Russia continues to say they had nothing to do with Meddling in our Election ! Where is the DNC Server , and why didn ’ t Shady James Comey and the now disgraced FBI agents take and closely examine it ? Why isn ’ t Hillary/Russia being looked at ? So many questions , so much corruption ! — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) June 28 , 2018
And at a campaign rally a few days later , he declared that Putin was “ fine. ” Trump was legitimizing both Putin and his disinformation .
Then came the meltdown in Finland . Shortly after a 90-plus-minutes private meeting with Putin—no aides were present—Trump stood next to the Russian autocrat at a press conference , as Putin once more denied Russian intervention in the 2016 election . Trump then noted he had discussed with Putin “ the issue of Russian interference in our elections , ” without challenging Putin ’ s denial . He allowed the denial to stand . By saying nothing—just days after the Justice Department had indicted 12 Russian military officers for the criminal scheme—Trump was providing the Russian strongman a platform for continuing the cover-up .
It got worse . Once again declaring there was “ no collusion , ” Trump attacked special counsel Robert Mueller ’ s investigation as a “ disaster ” and “ ridiculous. ” When he was asked whether he believed the US intelligence community or Putin , first Trump criticized the FBI and prattled on about the phony issue of the DNC server , yet again purposefully distracting from the core elements of the Trump-Russia scandal . Next , he said , “ My people came to me . [ Director of National Intelligence ] Dan Coates came to me and some others , they said they think it ’ s Russia . I have President Putin ; he just said it ’ s not Russia . I will say this : I don ’ t see any reason why it would be. ” Trump said he had “ confidence ” in both sides , meaning both Putin and his intelligence team . He continued : “ I have great confidence in my intelligence people , but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today . ”
Here was Trump drawing an equivalence between his top intelligence advisers and Putin , the former KGB officer . It was a stunning moment . What more could Putin want ? The president of the nation , which , according to its own intelligence and law enforcement agencies , was attacked by Russia , was giving Putin ’ s denial as much credence as Mueller ’ s indictments and the findings of various spy agencies , as well as the Republican-led intelligence committees of the House and Senate ( which each confirmed the intelligence community ’ s assessment ) .
Trump was toiling ( and trolling ) hand-in-hand with Putin to advance Moscow ’ s deceit . And here ’ s a key question : was this performance jointly planned in advance ? Both men said they did discuss the matter during their private tete-a-tete . It seems likely—in fact , highly probable—they talked about what they would say on this subject during the post-meeting press conference . ( The public can not be sure of this , because no one else , besides interpreters , attended the session , and no transcript has been released . ) Yet the events of the past two years already indict Trump : he has repeatedly aided Putin ’ s attempt to escape responsibility for the attack . And today , the two men issued respective messages—which might have been coordinated—that each supported and advanced Russian disinformation .
There you have it . Collusion . Trump working with Putin , in the open , to make the Russian attack on the United States disappear . Trump himself has proven the case .","Listen to David’s reaction to the Helsinki summit on the Mother Jones Podcast—the conversation starts at 23:55 on the player below.

Put aside the notion of whether Trump or anyone in his crew schemed with Russians on how to pull this off. Once the attack became public, Trump and his lieutenants continuously maintained it was nothing but a hoax. When the Democratic National Committee in June 2016 revealed it had been hacked by Russian operatives, the Trump campaign issued a statement huffing, “We believe it was the DNC that did the ‘hacking’ as a way to distract from the many issues facing their deeply flawed candidate and failed party leader.” After WikiLeaks released over 20,000 DNC emails right before the start of the Democratic convention the following month, the Hillary Clinton campaign tried to make the point this was Russian sabotage. Donald Trump Jr. and Paul Manafort hit the cable news shows to call this claim absurd. (Yet just weeks earlier, both had attended a secret meeting in Trump Tower with a Russian emissary, after being told this woman was bringing the campaign dirt on Clinton as part of a secret Kremlin plot to assist Trump.)

Trump led the denial charge himself. After being briefed in mid-August by US intelligence that Russia was behind the hack-and-dump operation against the Clinton campaign, he repeatedly declared that there was no reason to suspect Moscow was the culprit. He did this in speeches. And he did this in the debates with Clinton. At their first face-off, he said the perp “could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?” And following the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence’s release of a statement in early October 2016 stating that intelligence showed Russia was indeed behind this attack, Trump still vigorously insisted there was no reason to believe Moscow was involved.

Throughout this period, Russia, of course, was denying it was doing anything untoward. So Trump was echoing Putin’s disinformation. He was pushing Moscow’s line and dismissing the US government’s official finding. That made it easier for Russia to get away with the covert operation. With Trump very publicly challenging the notion that an attack was underway, Republican leaders—most notably, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.)—were disinclined to join the Obama administration in any effort to challenge or thwart Putin’s assault on the US political system. Trump provided Putin cover.

He continued to do so after the election. When the US intelligence community in January 2017 released an assessment confirming Russia had engaged in this information warfare and noting that this had been done in part to boost Trump’s chances, Trump refused to acknowledge the conclusions or to take clear action against Russia. Rather, he assailed the intelligence community, comparing it to Hitler’s regime. (“Are we living in Nazi Germany?” he tweeted.) And he stuck with this course through the first year of his presidency. After meeting with Putin at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in November 2017, Trump told reporters on Air Force One, “He said he didn’t meddle. I asked him again. You can only ask so many times.” Trump added: “Every time he sees me, he says, ‘I didn’t do that’, but I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it.” Trump continued, “I think he’s very insulted by it.”

Even though his administration has taken some actions against Russia—such as expelling Russian diplomats after the nerve agent attack in England—Trump has not stopped amplifying Putin’s assertion that Russia is innocent. And he tells his base—all those Fox News watchers—that the investigations are bunk and that the Deep State has manufactured this scandal to nail him. That is, Putin and the Kremlin are not the villains; the enemy is within.

As Putin has tried to cloak Russian culpability, Trump has been an eager helpmate. In the run-up to the Helsinki meeting, Trump tweeted, “Russia continues to say they had nothing to do with Meddling in our Election!”

Russia continues to say they had nothing to do with Meddling in our Election! Where is the DNC Server, and why didn’t Shady James Comey and the now disgraced FBI agents take and closely examine it? Why isn’t Hillary/Russia being looked at? So many questions, so much corruption! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 28, 2018

And at a campaign rally a few days later, he declared that Putin was “fine.” Trump was legitimizing both Putin and his disinformation.

Then came the meltdown in Finland. Shortly after a 90-plus-minutes private meeting with Putin—no aides were present—Trump stood next to the Russian autocrat at a press conference, as Putin once more denied Russian intervention in the 2016 election. Trump then noted he had discussed with Putin “the issue of Russian interference in our elections,” without challenging Putin’s denial. He allowed the denial to stand. By saying nothing—just days after the Justice Department had indicted 12 Russian military officers for the criminal scheme—Trump was providing the Russian strongman a platform for continuing the cover-up.

It got worse. Once again declaring there was “no collusion,” Trump attacked special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation as a “disaster” and “ridiculous.” When he was asked whether he believed the US intelligence community or Putin, first Trump criticized the FBI and prattled on about the phony issue of the DNC server, yet again purposefully distracting from the core elements of the Trump-Russia scandal. Next, he said, “My people came to me. [Director of National Intelligence] Dan Coates came to me and some others, they said they think it’s Russia. I have President Putin; he just said it’s not Russia. I will say this: I don’t see any reason why it would be.” Trump said he had “confidence” in both sides, meaning both Putin and his intelligence team. He continued: “I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today.”

Here was Trump drawing an equivalence between his top intelligence advisers and Putin, the former KGB officer. It was a stunning moment. What more could Putin want? The president of the nation, which, according to its own intelligence and law enforcement agencies, was attacked by Russia, was giving Putin’s denial as much credence as Mueller’s indictments and the findings of various spy agencies, as well as the Republican-led intelligence committees of the House and Senate (which each confirmed the intelligence community’s assessment).

Trump was toiling (and trolling) hand-in-hand with Putin to advance Moscow’s deceit. And here’s a key question: was this performance jointly planned in advance? Both men said they did discuss the matter during their private tete-a-tete. It seems likely—in fact, highly probable—they talked about what they would say on this subject during the post-meeting press conference. (The public cannot be sure of this, because no one else, besides interpreters, attended the session, and no transcript has been released.) Yet the events of the past two years already indict Trump: he has repeatedly aided Putin’s attempt to escape responsibility for the attack. And today, the two men issued respective messages—which might have been coordinated—that each supported and advanced Russian disinformation.

There you have it. Collusion. Trump working with Putin, in the open, to make the Russian attack on the United States disappear. Trump himself has proven the case.",www.motherjones.com,left,C9YJPcfTtGTwTGnH

Russia's government has resigned, hours after President Vladimir Putin proposed sweeping constitutional changes that could prolong his stay in power.

If approved by the public, the proposals would transfer power from the presidency to parliament.

Mr Putin is due to step down in 2024 when his fourth term of office comes to an end.

But there is speculation he could seek a new role or hold on to power behind the scenes.

Mr Putin put forward his plans in his annual state of the nation address to lawmakers. Later, in an unexpected move, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev announced that the government was resigning to help facilitate the changes.

Russian government sources told the BBC that ministers did not know about the government's resignation ahead of the announcement.

""It was a complete surprise,"" one source said.

What is Mr Putin proposing?

The Russian leader said during a speech to both chambers of parliament that there would be a nationwide vote on changes that would shift power from the presidency to parliament.

Constitutional reforms included giving the lower house of parliament, the State Duma, ""greater responsibility"" for the appointment of the prime minister and the cabinet.

Currently, the president appoints the prime minister, and the Duma approves the decision.

Mr Putin also suggested an increased role for an advisory body called the State Council. The council, which is currently chaired by Mr Putin, comprises the heads of Russia's federal regions. Mr Putin said it had proved to be ""highly effective"".

Other measures include:

Limiting the supremacy of international law

Amending the rules that limit presidents to two consecutive terms

Strengthening laws that prohibit presidential candidates who have held foreign citizenship or foreign residency permits

What was the response?

Mr Medvedev made his announcement on state television with President Putin sitting next to him.

""These changes, when they are adopted... will introduce substantial changes not only to an entire range of articles of the constitution, but also to the entire balance of power, the power of the executive, the power of the legislature, the power of judiciary,"" Mr Medvedev said of Mr Putin's proposals.

""In this context... the government in its current form has resigned.""

Mr Putin thanked Mr Medvedev for his work but said ""not everything"" had been accomplished.

He asked Mr Medvedev to become deputy head of the National Security Council, which is chaired by Mr Putin.

The president later nominated tax service chief Mikhail Mishustin to replace Mr Medvedev as prime minister.

Mr Medvedev has been prime minister for several years. He previously served as president from 2008-2012, switching roles with Mr Putin - a close ally - after the latter served his first two terms as president. Russia's constitution only allows presidents to serve two consecutive terms.

Even when he was prime minister, Mr Putin was widely seen as the power behind then President Medvedev.

Opposition leader and leading Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny said he believed that any referendum on the constitutional changes would be ""fraudulent crap"". He said Mr Putin's goal was to be ""sole leader for life"".

The last time Russia held a referendum was in 1993 when it adopted the constitution under President Boris Yeltsin, Mr Putin's predecessor.

Mr Putin became acting president following Mr Yeltsin's resignation in 1999 and was formally inaugurated a year later. He has held the reins of power - as president or prime minister - ever since.

Part of Putin's bigger plan?

President Putin likes stability. It's his thing. So the newsflash that the entire government had resigned was a big surprise. From the online chatter, it seems even the cabinet ministers didn't see it coming. For a moment it was like a flashback to Russia of the 1990s, when President Yeltsin changed prime ministers as readily as his socks. Vladimir Putin is no Yeltsin, though, and this move looks like part of some bigger plan that's all about consolidating - and extending - his hold on power.

Under the current rules, Mr Putin must step down as president in 2024 and it's never been clear what he'd do next. That's still true. But the constitutional tweaks he's proposed are hints at some options. He's bumped up the status of the little-known State Council, which he already heads. Or he could become PM again, now he's slightly weakened the powers of Russia's president.

If he is sticking around, perhaps he needs to make that palatable to people given all the social and economic problems he had to list once again in his annual address to the nation. If Mr Putin were to blame for their woes, Russians might well wonder why they should swallow him staying on, post-2024. Dmitry Medvedev - so often useful to Mr Putin - for now looks like a handy scapegoat.

What else did Mr Putin say?

In his address to parliament, the president unveiled a series of plans to increase the number of children being born in Russia. Like several Eastern European states, Russia has been struggling with a declining birth rate.

Last year Mr Putin promised tax breaks for bigger families.

On Wednesday he pledged state funding for new mothers in a bid to increase the number of children being born from an average of fewer than 1.5 per woman to 1.7 within four years.

So-called ""maternity capital"" has until now only been paid to families with at least two children.

Welfare benefits will also be paid for children aged three to seven in low-income families, and free school meals will be provided for the first four years of school.

A tentative plan was devised that would have seen the WikiLeaks founder smuggled out of Ecuador ’ s London embassy in a diplomatic vehicle and transported to another country .
One ultimate destination , multiple sources have said , was Russia , where Assange would not be at risk of extradition to the US . The plan was abandoned after it was deemed too risky .
The operation to extract Assange was provisionally scheduled for Christmas Eve in 2017 , one source claimed , and was linked to an unsuccessful attempt by Ecuador to give Assange formal diplomatic status .
The involvement of Russian officials in hatching what was described as a “ basic ” plan raises new questions about Assange ’ s ties to the Kremlin . The WikiLeaks editor is a key figure in the ongoing US criminal investigation into Russia ’ s attempts to sway the outcome of the 2016 presidential election .
Robert Mueller , the special counsel conducting the investigation , filed criminal charges in July against a dozen Russian GRU military intelligence officers who allegedly hacked Democratic party servers during the presidential campaign . The indictment claims the hackers sent emails that embarrassed Hillary Clinton to WikiLeaks . The circumstances of the handover are still under investigation .
According to Mueller , WikiLeaks published “ over 50,000 documents ” stolen by Russian spies . The first tranche arrived on 14 July 2016 as an encrypted attachment .
Details of the Assange escape plan are sketchy . Two sources familiar with the inner workings of the Ecuadorian embassy said that Fidel Narváez , a close confidant of Assange who until recently served as Ecuador ’ s London consul , served as a point of contact with Moscow .
In an interview with ███ , Narváez denied having been involved in discussions with Russia about extracting Assange from the embassy .
Narváez said he visited Russia ’ s embassy in Kensington twice this year as part of a group of “ 20-30 more diplomats from different countries ” . These were “ open-public meetings ” , he said , that took place during the “ UK-Russian crisis ” – a reference to the aftermath of the novichok poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in March .
Sources said the escape plot involved giving Assange diplomatic documents so that Ecuador would be able to claim he enjoyed diplomatic immunity . As part of the operation , Assange was to be collected from the embassy in a diplomatic vehicle .
Four separate sources said the Kremlin was willing to offer support for the plan – including the possibility of allowing Assange to travel to Russia and live there . One of them said that an unidentified Russian businessman served as an intermediary in these discussions .
The possibility that Assange could travel to Ecuador by boat was also considered .
Narváez previously played a role in trying to secure Edward Snowden ’ s safe passage following his leak of secret NSA material in 2013 . Narváez gave the former NSA contractor a so-called safe-conduct pass when he left Hong Kong for Moscow , where Snowden eventually found asylum . At the time , the then president of Ecuador , Rafael Correa , said Narváez had issued the pass without the government ’ s knowledge . The Spanish-language broadcaster Univision reported that Narváez travelled to Moscow the same day that he issued the safe passage document to Snowden ; other sources have corroborated this report .
Assange ’ s Christmas Eve escape was aborted with just days to go , one source claimed . Rommy Vallejo , the head of Ecuador ’ s intelligence agency , allegedly travelled to the UK on or around 15 December 2017 to oversee the operation and left London when it was called off .
In February Vallejo quit his job and is believed to be in Nicaragua . He is under investigation for the alleged kidnapping in 2012 of a political rival to Correa .
Ecuador ’ s new president , Lenín Moreno , has said he wants Assange to quit the embassy . In March the government in Quito cut off his internet access and restricted his visitors .
Melinda Taylor , a lawyer specialising in human rights and international criminal law who represents Assange , has denounced his confinement in the embassy .
“ I think it is shocking that Assange has been detained arbitrarily for approximately eight years for publishing evidence of war crimes and human rights violations . The UK could end this situation today , by providing assurances that Assange will not be extradited to the United States . ”
Sources offered conflicting accounts of who cancelled the Assange operation , but all agreed it was deemed to be too risky . The stumbling block was the UK ’ s refusal to grant Assange diplomatic protection .
Under UK law , diplomats are immune from criminal prosecution if their diplomatic credentials have been accepted by the British government , and if the Foreign Office has been alerted to the diplomat ’ s status .
This is not the first time Assange has apparently considered seeking refuge in Russia . The Associated Press reported this week that the WikiLeaks founder tried to obtain a Russian visa . He signed a letter in November 2010 granting power of attorney to “ my friend ” Israel Shamir – a controversial supporter who passed leaked US state department cables from Assange to journalists in Moscow . Shamir would deliver Assange ’ s passport to the Russian consulate , and collect it afterwards , Assange wrote .
At the time Assange was facing allegations of rape and sexual assault made by two women in Sweden . In 2012 he sought asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy after he lost a battle against extradition in the supreme court . Assange denies the women ’ s claims . Swedish authorities eventually dropped both cases after the statute of limitations expired . Assange faces arrest for breaching his bail conditions .
During the US presidential campaign , Donald Trump praised WikiLeaks for releasing the emails that damaged Clinton . Confidential visitor logs obtained by ███ reveal that Assange received several Russian nationals during the summer of 2016 , including senior figures from RT , the Kremlin ’ s international propaganda channel .
In March 2017 WikiLeaks published confidential CIA documents . Assange believes a grand jury indicted him over this and other leaks , with the charges filed under seal . Were he to leave the embassy the US would seek his extradition , his lawyers say .
The Ecuadorian government declined to comment . The Russian embassy in London tweeted on Friday that ███ story was “ another example of disinformation and fake news from the British media ” .","Russian diplomats held secret talks in London last year with people close to Julian Assange to assess whether they could help him flee the UK, the Guardian has learned.

In an interview with the Guardian, Narváez denied having been involved in discussions with Russia about extracting Assange from the embassy.

Narváez said he visited Russia’s embassy in Kensington twice this year as part of a group of “20-30 more diplomats from different countries”. These were “open-public meetings”, he said, that took place during the “UK-Russian crisis” – a reference to the aftermath of the novichok poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in March.

Sources said the escape plot involved giving Assange diplomatic documents so that Ecuador would be able to claim he enjoyed diplomatic immunity. As part of the operation, Assange was to be collected from the embassy in a diplomatic vehicle.

Four separate sources said the Kremlin was willing to offer support for the plan – including the possibility of allowing Assange to travel to Russia and live there. One of them said that an unidentified Russian businessman served as an intermediary in these discussions.

The possibility that Assange could travel to Ecuador by boat was also considered.

Narváez previously played a role in trying to secure Edward Snowden’s safe passage following his leak of secret NSA material in 2013. Narváez gave the former NSA contractor a so-called safe-conduct pass when he left Hong Kong for Moscow, where Snowden eventually found asylum. At the time, the then president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said Narváez had issued the pass without the government’s knowledge. The Spanish-language broadcaster Univision reported that Narváez travelled to Moscow the same day that he issued the safe passage document to Snowden; other sources have corroborated this report.

Assange’s Christmas Eve escape was aborted with just days to go, one source claimed. Rommy Vallejo, the head of Ecuador’s intelligence agency, allegedly travelled to the UK on or around 15 December 2017 to oversee the operation and left London when it was called off.

In February Vallejo quit his job and is believed to be in Nicaragua. He is under investigation for the alleged kidnapping in 2012 of a political rival to Correa.

Ecuador’s new president, Lenín Moreno, has said he wants Assange to quit the embassy. In March the government in Quito cut off his internet access and restricted his visitors.

Melinda Taylor, a lawyer specialising in human rights and international criminal law who represents Assange, has denounced his confinement in the embassy.

“I think it is shocking that Assange has been detained arbitrarily for approximately eight years for publishing evidence of war crimes and human rights violations. The UK could end this situation today, by providing assurances that Assange will not be extradited to the United States.”

Sources offered conflicting accounts of who cancelled the Assange operation, but all agreed it was deemed to be too risky. The stumbling block was the UK’s refusal to grant Assange diplomatic protection.

Under UK law, diplomats are immune from criminal prosecution if their diplomatic credentials have been accepted by the British government, and if the Foreign Office has been alerted to the diplomat’s status.

This is not the first time Assange has apparently considered seeking refuge in Russia. The Associated Press reported this week that the WikiLeaks founder tried to obtain a Russian visa. He signed a letter in November 2010 granting power of attorney to “my friend” Israel Shamir – a controversial supporter who passed leaked US state department cables from Assange to journalists in Moscow. Shamir would deliver Assange’s passport to the Russian consulate, and collect it afterwards, Assange wrote.

At the time Assange was facing allegations of rape and sexual assault made by two women in Sweden. In 2012 he sought asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy after he lost a battle against extradition in the supreme court. Assange denies the women’s claims. Swedish authorities eventually dropped both cases after the statute of limitations expired. Assange faces arrest for breaching his bail conditions.

During the US presidential campaign, Donald Trump praised WikiLeaks for releasing the emails that damaged Clinton. Confidential visitor logs obtained by the Guardian reveal that Assange received several Russian nationals during the summer of 2016, including senior figures from RT, the Kremlin’s international propaganda channel.

In March 2017 WikiLeaks published confidential CIA documents. Assange believes a grand jury indicted him over this and other leaks, with the charges filed under seal. Were he to leave the embassy the US would seek his extradition, his lawyers say.

The Ecuadorian government declined to comment. The Russian embassy in London tweeted on Friday that the Guardian story was “another example of disinformation and fake news from the British media”.",www.theguardian.com,left,xfb5Ah4S9YEzGiOj

WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump's lead attorney Sunday walked back earlier suggestions that targets in the ongoing investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election could be pardoned by the president.

""The president is not going to issue a pardon in this investigation,"" Rudy Giuliani said. ""I want that to come out loud and clear.""

But Giuliani, in an appearance on CNN's State of the Union, left open the possibility that the president could take action when the Russia inquiry was concluded if he determined that people had been ""treated unfairly.""

""You are not going to get a pardon just because you are involved in this investigation,"" the outspoken former New York mayor said, before quickly adding that those targets ""certainly won't be excluded.""

Giuliani raised the prospect that the president was considering pardons late last week, after former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort was jailed for violating terms of his bail in Washington. He is awaiting a September trial on money laundering and fraud charges. He also faces a July trial in Alexandria, Va., where he is charged with bank and tax fraud.

A federal judge revoked Manafort's $10 million bond Friday after he was charged with obstruction for allegedly tampering with witnesses in the pending criminal cases against him.

Manafort is one of 20 people known to be charged in the yearlong Russia investigation. Five people, including former national security adviser Michael Flynn, and Trump campaign deputy Rick Gates have pleaded guilty.

""When the whole thing is over, things might get cleaned up with some presidential pardons,"" Giuliani told the New York Daily News. ""You put a guy in jail if he’s trying to kill witnesses, not just talking to witnesses.""

Giuliani also renewed his attacks on the legitimacy of the Russia inquiry headed by Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller.

Citing findings in last week's Justice Department inspector general's report related to the conduct of two senior FBI agents, the former mayor called for a review of the origins of the Russia investigation.

The inspector general, during an 18-month review of the handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation, unearthed text messages exchanged by the agents in which they disparaged Trump. Both of the agents held top positions in both the FBI's Clinton and Trump investigations.

In one of the messages, FBI counter-intelligence official Peter Strzok suggested that he might take action to ""stop"" Trump's candidacy.

""We want the Mueller probe to be investigated,"" Giuliani said Sunday.

Later Sunday, Giuliani said on CBS' Face the Nation that he would continue to push for such an internal review as a condition in the ongoing negotiations with Mueller who is seeking an interview with Trump in the Russia inquiry.

As part of that investigation, Mueller's team is reviewing whether Trump sought to obstruct the probe when he fired FBI Director James Comey last year.

""We are in rather sensitive negotiations,"" Giuliani said, adding that it was important to first learn whether Strzok had ""infected"" the Russia investigation before he was removed last year.

""I don't want to do it,"" Giuliani said, referring to a Mueller interview with Trump. ""The president wants to do it.""

Late Monday afternoon , White House press secretary Sarah Sanders released a banal-sounding statement : that , “ for reasons of transparency ” and in response to requests from Congress , President Trump has directed the Justice Department to declassify a whole bunch of materials related to the Russia investigation — the ongoing inquiry into his own campaign — immediately .
Those materials include a few specific things Trump wanted declassified : certain sections of the Carter Page FISA application ( but , notably , not other sections of it ) and FBI interviews related to Page , as well as FBI interviews with Justice Department official Bruce Ohr .
The real bombshell , though , was in the second paragraph of Sanders ’ s statement : “ President Donald J. Trump has directed the Department of Justice ( including the FBI ) to publicly release all text messages relating to the Russia investigation , without redaction , of James Comey , Andrew McCabe , Peter Strzok , Lisa Page , and Bruce Ohr . ”
In other words , the president is demanding the release of an enormous amount of internal material , without redaction , about an ongoing investigation into his campaign and his associates .
Those text messages could discuss all manner of things , including , potentially , investigators ’ suspicions , secret evidence , investigative methods , and information on confidential sources whose lives could be put at risk ( if his instruction to release them “ without redaction ” truly is carried out ) .
The timing of the release is unclear . The White House statement calls for “ immediate ” declassification . However , a Justice Department spokesperson told Politico that they were interpreting the order as starting “ a declassification review process that is conducted by various agencies within the intelligence community , in conjunction with the White House Counsel , to seek to ensure the safety of America ’ s national security interests . ”
That suggests a far less indiscriminate release that will give agencies the chance to raise concerns about certain disclosures — but it also seems to go against the plain text of the president ’ s statement . So we ’ ll have to see if the Justice Department manages to get the president to climb down .
Trump has declassified minor materials before , but he ’ s done never done anything as wide-ranging as this . And he ’ s doing this days after his former campaign chair , Paul Manafort , finally agreed to cooperate with Mueller ’ s team .
The goal appears obvious : Trump is searching for something , anything , new he can use to try to discredit the investigation . The GOP has been making hay of the texts between Strzok and Page all year , and this is an effort to surface similar material Trump can use to attack Mueller .
Trump wants to release texts from five people he ’ s cast as villains in a “ deep state ” plot against him
Trump has singled out Russia investigation-related texts from four former officials and one current official whom he and conservative media have cast as villains in their narrative of a deep state plot against the president .

It is also unclear how often Comey and McCabe texted about the Russia investigation ; they may have preferred other forms of communication . And Ohr is not known to have ever had any official role in the investigation .
However , Strzok and Page were deeply involved in the day-to-day workings of the Russia probe for much of 2016 and 2017 , and they texted a whole lot about it too . Many of those texts were released earlier this year at congressional request , but they were heavily redacted .
Take , for instance , this text Strzok wrote on August 2 , 2016 , just days after the investigation was opened , saying he was about to interview someone ( apparently in connection with the probe ) . The DOJ redacted the person ’ s name :
Or a redacted text Strzok wrote that same month , just before sending an animated text about “ THESE ALLEGATIONS AND THE PERVASIVE CONNECTIONS. ” What was the message that came before that text ?
Or this text exchange shortly after Trump fired Comey , in which Page and Strzok discuss the need to “ lock in ” someone “ in a formal chargeable way. ” Who were they trying to “ lock in ” ?
There are many , many more examples in the thousands of texts Strzok and Page exchanged while they were working together . You can read the previously released redacted texts here and here .
Even the instruction itself isn ’ t entirely clear . Is Trump demanding the release of these five people ’ s texts with each other ? Or each of their Russia-related texts with anyone ? The latter possibility would be far more wide-ranging .
The declassifications should be fascinating for Russia probe watchers , who will get a closer look at day-to-day happenings in the early daystrzs of the investigation .
But if Trump insists his order be carried out as stated , it will likely be difficult for the Justice Department to stomach , considering how much this would disclose about an extremely sensitive investigation — one that is , again , still active — and how much it would reveal about their sources and methods .
And , again , Trump is essentially demanding a look at the inner workings of an investigation into his own campaign , an investigation that he has routinely attacked and undermined .

With the 2020 presidential elections looming , candidates are expected to campaign with promises of making the full report public . Many of the Democratic hopefuls - Beto O'Rourke , Bernie Sanders , Cory Booker , Amy Klobuchar , Kirsten Gillibrand , and Julian Castro - have called for the full release of the report .

Special Counsel Robert Mueller has submitted his long-awaited report on alleged collusion between Russia and President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign.

A justice department official said Mr Mueller's report did not recommend any further indictments.

Six former Trump aides and a dozen Russians already face unrelated charges in connection with the investigation.

The Attorney General William Barr will now summarise the report and decide how much to share with Congress.

Mr Barr told congressional leaders in a letter that he anticipated being able to inform them of the report's key findings over the weekend.

The report is intended to explain any prosecutorial decisions the special counsel has made in the 22 months since his appointment by deputy US Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.

After today's developments, however, the president will continue to claim he is the victim of an unfounded ""witch hunt"".

His political adversaries, who were hoping for a courtroom coup de grace, will be left searching for a new silver bullet.

What's the reaction?

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How US networks reacted to Mueller news

White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement: ""The next steps are up to Attorney General Barr and we look forward to the process taking its course. The White House has not received or been briefed on the Special Counsel's report.""

Mr Trump's personal lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Jay Sekulow echoed a similar sentiment, saying they were ""pleased"" the report had been delivered and trust Mr Barr to ""determine the appropriate next steps"".

Mr Nadler, a New York Democrat, acknowledged the investigation had concluded on Twitter, saying: ""We look forward to getting the full Mueller report and related materials.""

Earlier this month, the House of Representatives voted unanimously for a resolution demanding the Department of Justice release the full report to the public, signalling support within both parties to find out whether Mr Mueller discovered any criminal wrongdoing.

Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer also called for transparency in a joint statement, adding that the White House ""must not be allowed to interfere"".

""The Special Counsel's investigation focused on questions that go to the integrity of our democracy itself: whether foreign powers corruptly interfered in our elections, and whether unlawful means were used to hinder that investigation. The American people have a right to the truth.""

Mr Graham, a South Carolina Republican and vocal Trump supporter, said he ""always believed it was important that Mr Mueller be allowed to do his job without interference, and that has been accomplished"".

What comes next?

What happens next is in Mr Barr's hands. Legally, the attorney general is under no obligation to release the report publicly, and his copy to Congress could contain redactions, but during his confirmation hearings before senators he vowed to release as much as he could.

And if he does provide Congress with the full details, members could leak the report to the public.

With the 2020 presidential elections looming, candidates are expected to campaign with promises of making the full report public. Many of the Democratic hopefuls - Beto O'Rourke, Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Julian Castro - have called for the full release of the report.

The House of Representatives will also continue to investigate the administration, and they could ask Mr Mueller to testify or demand that Mr Barr provide relevant materials.",www.bbc.com,center,mqfos9LNmHi9sbSa

Washington said on Wednesday it would impose fresh sanctions by the end of August after it determined that Moscow had used a nerve agent against a former Russian agent and his daughter in Britain, sending Russia’s rouble currency to a two-year low.

Speaking on a weekly TV talk show, Siluanov said the new U.S. sanctions, some of which could restrict purchases of Russian government bonds, were “unpleasant but not fatal”.

“We have lowered to the minimum level and will further decrease our investment in the U.S. economy, in the U.S. securities,” Siluanov said, shedding light on the nature of an unexpected drop in Russia’s holdings of U.S. Treasury bonds.

Russia has ditched its holdings of U.S. Treasuries in the past few months as relations between Moscow and Washington have deteriorated, data showed last month.

Russia will also have more settlement in roubles and other currencies, such as the euro, than in dollars, Siluanov said.

“Eventually, this will negatively impact U.S. investors. But we are not planning now any limitations such as shutting down McDonalds,” Siluanov said. He referred to calls by some lawmakers to shut down prominent U.S. companies in Russia starting from 2014, when relations with the West soured over Russia’s annexation of Crimea and its role in Ukraine’s crisis.

“Our citizens work in these companies, these companies pay taxes into the budget of our country,” Siluanov said.

While admitting that U.S. sanctions would boost inflation in Russia as they hurt the rouble, Siluanov said there were no plans to ban using the dollar in Russia.

“Of course, the government has no such plans. That would be a step to an impasse.”",www.reuters.com,center,9lUl8nCqjgEWgoxU

WASHINGTON – Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats had to tell President Donald Trump in 2017 that it was not his job to get involved in FBI investigations.

When Mike Pompeo was Trump’s first CIA director, Trump complained to him multiple times that no one would publicly defend him in the Russia investigation.

And Adm. Michael Rogers, who headed the National Security Agency in 2017, was so concerned about Trump’s request to refute news stories linking him to Russia that he documented the exchange. Rogers’ deputy director described Trump’s call as the most unusual thing he’d experienced in 40 years of government service.

Those details from special counsel Robert Mueller’s report offer a behind-the-scenes look at Trump’s often fraught relationship with the leaders of the intelligence community. Trump took office voicing skepticism about the intelligence community’s conclusion that Russia interfered to help him win the White House.

After FBI Director James Comey publicly confirmed March 20, 2017 that his agency was investigating possible coordination between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign, Trump leaned on other intelligence community leaders for help.

Trump fired Comey less than two months later, telling the Russia foreign minister the next day that he ""faced great pressure because of Russia. That's taken off.... I'm not under investigation.""

Rogers retired last year. Pompeo is now Trump’s secretary of state. Coats is still advising Trump, but he’s had several public conflicts with the president that have led to speculation about whether he will remain in the job.

Coats didn’t go as far as some of his aides did in describing to Mueller’s team his interactions with Trump about the Russia investigation.

Michael Dempsey, a Coats aide, remembers Coats saying after the meeting that Trump asked him to contact Comey to see if there was a way to end the Russia investigation. Dempsey said Coats made it clear that he would not get involved with an ongoing FBI investigation.

Trump v. Coats:'They are wrong!' Donald Trump crosses swords with intel chief Coats

Another aide told the special counsel that Coats was upset after the meeting because Trump wanted him to convince Comey there was nothing to the Russia investigation. A third aide said Coats told him that the president asked what he could do to “help with the investigation.”

Three days after the Oval office meeting, Trump again complained to Coats in a phone call. Coats said he told the president that the investigations were going to go on and the best thing to do was to let them run their course.

When Rogers got a similar call from Trump, the president complained that the investigation was messing up his ability to get things done with Russia. Trump asked Rogers if he could do anything to refute the news stories, according to the report.

Both Coats and Rogers later testified before Congress that they had not felt pressured by Trump to do what he wanted.

'Does not exonerate' Trump

Pompeo told investigators that he didn’t remember the March 22 meeting but did recall that Trump regularly urged officials to get the word out that he had not done anything wrong related to Russia.

Their interactions with Trump are some of the facts laid out by Mueller’s team in their report on whether Trump committed a crime by obstructing the Russia investigation. While the special counsel did not charge Trump, his office pointedly declined to say that it had cleared the president of wrongdoing, writing instead that the report ""also does not exonerate him.""

In this instance, Mueller concluded that the evidence did not establish that Trump asked or directed the intelligence agency leaders to interfere with the FBI’s investigation. But Trump’s intent in reaching out to Coats, Pompeo and Rogers is still relevant to understand what motivated Trump’s other actions, the office says.

It’s one of the pieces of “substantial evidence,” the report lists that indicates Trump tried to have Mueller removed because he knew he was being investigated for potential obstruction of justice.

Mueller wasn’t fired, however, because White House counsel Don McGahn decided he would resign rather than trigger what he regarded as a potential Saturday Night Massacre, a reference to former President Richard Nixon firing prosecutors during the Watergate investigation.

""The president's efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that was largely because the persons who surrounded the president declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests,"" the report said. ""Consistent with that pattern, the evidence we obtained would not support potential obstruction of justice charges against the president's aides and associates beyond those already filed.""

Mueller report:Trump repeatedly tried to impede the Russia probe, Mueller report said. Was it obstruction?

All of which is to say—there are elements on both the Republican and Democratic side whose interest it is to erode the legitimacy of elections in a short-term play to gain votes for their preferred political candidate with long-term consequences to the legitimacy of U.S. elections and political processes going forward.

What Happens Next:

There’s more to come. Now that Trump has been acquitted, he’s emboldened to take even more aggressive and controversial political decisions. While Senator Susan Collins of Maine believed that Trump learned his lesson, Trump himself begs to differ (forcing Collins to concede that her comments were more “aspirational” than anything else). And with the precedent set that this batch of GOP senators are highly unlikely to abandon him (especially as elections draw nearer), Trump may well solicit other foreign actors to interfere on his behalf—at this point, he’s facing his last election ever and has little to lose by doing so.

The Key Statistic That Explains It:

According to a poll conducted by Ipsos and C-Span this past September, 46 percent of Americans have little to no confidence that November elections will be “open and fair.” This week’s developments won’t help.

The One Thing to Read About It:

Eurasia Group’s Top Risk #1 for 2020. I was particularly proud of the list Eurasia Group put out this year, but I didn’t think our top risk would begin panning out less than two months into the new year.

The One Major Misconception About It:

People have long been pointing the finger at Trump and foreign actors like Russia whenever the issue of election legitimacy comes up. This week conclusively proved that Democrats are going to add to the conspiracy theory mix, and that the U.S. doesn’t need any help muddling electoral results, it can do so just fine by itself, thank you very much.

The One Thing to Say About It at a Dinner Party:

In a functioning political system, Iowa would be the wake-up call both sides need to get serious about protecting the legitimacy of elections, from both threats foreign (election interference, hacking, fake news) and domestic (all that plus US politicians seizing on conspiracy theories for their own political purposes). But given the toxicity of U.S. politics these days, it’s more likely that all sides will point fingers at each other in the hopes of scoring a victory in an election both sides will frame as illegitimate, only to contend the same election was legitimate once their side wins it.

russia,BBC News,1,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-43186124,Trump-Russia: Democrats defend Russia inquiry in memo,,,"Congressional Democrats have released a memo that counters Republican claims of bias in the investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election .
The memo says the FBI and US justice department did not - as the Republicans allege - abuse powers to spy on former Trump campaign aide Carter Page .
Mr Page was investigated over concerns that he was a Russian agent .
The memo was issued by Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee . Mr Trump called it a `` political and legal bust '' .
The president has repeatedly denied any collusion between his campaign and Russia .
The 10-page Democratic memo was released on Saturday . Parts of the document were redacted to avoid revealing intelligence gathering sources .
It calls a Republican memo published by Republican members of the Intelligence Committee earlier this month a `` transparent effort to undermine '' the FBI , the justice department and investigations into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia .
One : The Steele dossier : The Republican document alleged that the FBI used unsubstantiated evidence to spy on Carter Page , who was put under electronic surveillance by the intelligence agency .
Central to that claim was the charge that , in its application to a court for a surveillance warrant against Mr Page in 2016 , the FBI had relied upon evidence contained in a dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele - without revealing that his findings had been funded in part by the Hillary Clinton campaign .
The Democrats argue in their document that officials had not relied on Mr Steele 's dossier alone but had provided `` additional information from multiple independent sources that corroborated Steele 's reporting '' , informing the court of existing FBI operations against the Russians over their alleged campaign to influence the US election .
Furthermore , they reveal that the FBI had interviewed Mr Page over his Russian links and opened its inquiry months before the Steele dossier had been received .
Two : Who paid Steele ? Democrats also reject the allegation that failure to mention explicitly that the dossier had been funded by the Clinton campaign constituted bias . In their rebuttal , Democrats argue that the Steele dossier had been commissioned by someone who wanted to discredit Mr Trump .
Three : Yahoo News - a source ? The Democratic memo also challenges the Republican point that the FBI had used a Yahoo article to corroborate Mr Steele 's claims . The memo says the aim was to inform the court of Mr Page 's `` public denial of his suspected meetings in Moscow '' .
Four : Judges were Republican In order to demonstrate the lack of political bias , the Democratic memo also points out that judges on the court that agreed to a surveillance warrant for Carter Page had all been appointed by Republicans .
Five : It proved useful And the latest memo adds that the investigation into Mr Page 's activities had yielded `` valuable intelligence '' .
Adam Schiff , the top Democrat on the intelligence committee , said the document should `` put to rest '' Republican assertions of wrongdoing .
But the Republicans issued a new document to reject the Democratic memo point by point .
Robert Mueller , the special counsel conducting the inquiry into alleged Russian interference , has charged 19 people , including four former Trump advisers .
Mr Trump 's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and business associate Rick Gates have been charged with tax and bank fraud and conspiracy to launder money .
Michael Flynn , a former US national security adviser , pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI over meetings he had with the Russian Ambassador , Sergei Kislyak .
George Papadopoulos , a former Trump campaign adviser , admitted lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians .
The list also includes 13 Russians charged with tampering in the 2016 US election .

The memo says the FBI and US justice department did not - as the Republicans allege - abuse powers to spy on former Trump campaign aide Carter Page.

Mr Page was investigated over concerns that he was a Russian agent.

The memo was issued by Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee. Mr Trump called it a ""political and legal bust"".

The president has repeatedly denied any collusion between his campaign and Russia.

The 10-page Democratic memo was released on Saturday. Parts of the document were redacted to avoid revealing intelligence gathering sources.

It calls a Republican memo published by Republican members of the Intelligence Committee earlier this month a ""transparent effort to undermine"" the FBI, the justice department and investigations into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.

What are the main arguments?

One: The Steele dossier: The Republican document alleged that the FBI used unsubstantiated evidence to spy on Carter Page, who was put under electronic surveillance by the intelligence agency.

Central to that claim was the charge that, in its application to a court for a surveillance warrant against Mr Page in 2016, the FBI had relied upon evidence contained in a dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele - without revealing that his findings had been funded in part by the Hillary Clinton campaign.

The Democrats argue in their document that officials had not relied on Mr Steele's dossier alone but had provided ""additional information from multiple independent sources that corroborated Steele's reporting"", informing the court of existing FBI operations against the Russians over their alleged campaign to influence the US election.

Furthermore, they reveal that the FBI had interviewed Mr Page over his Russian links and opened its inquiry months before the Steele dossier had been received.

Two: Who paid Steele? Democrats also reject the allegation that failure to mention explicitly that the dossier had been funded by the Clinton campaign constituted bias. In their rebuttal, Democrats argue that the Steele dossier had been commissioned by someone who wanted to discredit Mr Trump.

Three: Yahoo News - a source? The Democratic memo also challenges the Republican point that the FBI had used a Yahoo article to corroborate Mr Steele's claims. The memo says the aim was to inform the court of Mr Page's ""public denial of his suspected meetings in Moscow"".

Four: Judges were Republican In order to demonstrate the lack of political bias, the Democratic memo also points out that judges on the court that agreed to a surveillance warrant for Carter Page had all been appointed by Republicans.

Five: It proved useful And the latest memo adds that the investigation into Mr Page's activities had yielded ""valuable intelligence"".

Does the release of the memo end this argument?

Unlikely.

Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee, said the document should ""put to rest"" Republican assertions of wrongdoing.

But the Republicans issued a new document to reject the Democratic memo point by point.

What has the inquiry found so far?

Robert Mueller, the special counsel conducting the inquiry into alleged Russian interference, has charged 19 people, including four former Trump advisers.

Mr Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and business associate Rick Gates have been charged with tax and bank fraud and conspiracy to launder money.

Michael Flynn, a former US national security adviser, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI over meetings he had with the Russian Ambassador, Sergei Kislyak.

George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, admitted lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians.

The list also includes 13 Russians charged with tampering in the 2016 US election.

But, as President Trump has repeatedly pointed out, the ongoing inquiry has yet to file a charge that any of his associates colluded with an alleged Kremlin plot to influence the result of the 2016 presidential election.",www.bbc.com,center,JTzt3FKvVrUAQ86Q

The former president sat down with The New York Times recently and chatted about all kinds of subjects. The Times decided to play up the fact that Carter — one of the worst presidents in U.S. history — would love to go over to North Korea as an envoy.

But the Times is steadily proving how out of touch it is, and how it no longer seems to actually “get” what real news is.

Here are some major highlights from the interview:

1. The Russians didn’t steal the 2016 election.

Carter was asked “Did the Russians purloin the election from Hillary?”

“I don’t think there’s any evidence that what the Russians did changed enough votes — or any votes,” Carter said.

So the hard-left former president doesn’t think the Russians stole the election? Take note, Capitol Hill Democrats.

2. We didn’t vote for Hillary.

Carter and his wife, Roselyn, disagreed on the Russia question. In the interview, she “looked over archly [and said] ‘They obviously did'” purloin the election.

“Rosie and I have a difference of opinion on that,” Carter said.

Rosalynn then said, “The drip-drip-drip about Hillary.”

Which prompted Carter to note that during the primary, they didn’t vote for Hillary Clinton. “We voted for Sanders.”

3. Obama fell far short of his promises.

Barack Obama whooshed into office on pledges of delivering “hope and change” to the country, spilt by partisan politics.

He didn’t. In fact, he made it worse.

“He made some very wonderful statements, in my opinion, when he first got in office, and then he reneged on that,” he said about Obama’s action on the Middle East.

4. Media “harder on Trump than any president.”

A recent Harvard study showed that 93% of new coverage about President Trump is negative.

But here’s another shocker: Carter defended Trump.

“I think the media have been harder on Trump than any other president certainly that I’ve known about,” Carter said. “I think they feel free to claim that Trump is mentally deranged and everything else without hesitation.”

5. NFL players should “stand during the American anthem.”

Carter, who joined the other four living ex-presidents on Saturday for a hurricane fundraiser, put his hand on his heart when the national anthem played — and he has a strong opinion about what NFL players should do, too.

“I think they ought to find a different way to object, to demonstrate,” he said. ” I would rather see all the players stand during the American anthem.”",www.dailywire.com,right,ggygSr05qBpyCaKA
