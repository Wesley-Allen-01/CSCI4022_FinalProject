Though it was preordained , Mueller ’ s silence has nevertheless raised expectations as to what he might deliver once ballots are cast .

The No . 2 Justice Department official , who took over the Russia probe after Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself last year , has come under frequent attacks from Trump and the president ’ s allies in the House .

Of course , how long Rosenstein will remain in control of the probe is also an open question .

russia,National Review,2,https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/03/vladimir-putin-western-nations-must-confront-russian-president/,Stand Up to Putin,2018-03-20,"John Mccormack, Michael Brendan Dougherty, Mairead Mcardle, Robert Verbruggen, Carrie Severino, Tobias Hoonhout, Rich Lowry, Jim Geraghty","President Putin ’ s landslide victory in Russia ’ s presidential election was achieved against the lackluster competition of a group of mediocre candidates from which the sole serious opponent had been excluded ; amid plausible allegations that his security services had tried to poison two Russians in England by the use of a chemical nerve agent banned under international law ; and with the overwhelming support of Russian news media that reported the attempted murders as a Western plot to weaken and embarrass Russia . It ought to be possible to win a landslide victory in such circumstances without resorting to ballot-stuffing . But according to several reports , that was done too . And , of course , Putin fought the election as a tough patriotic czar who had reintegrated Crimea into Russia , reestablished a strong Russian presence in the Middle East , prevented the European Union from swallowing Ukraine whole , and made Russia feared again , rather than despised , with a massive and technically advanced military buildup . Certain parallels spring to mind .
Is the Russian president sitting pretty , therefore ? Too many Western commentators are inclined to treat Putin with a kind of admiring hostility , denouncing him as a lawless despot while grudgingly admitting that the West has no effective way of responding to his ruthless tactics in Ukraine , in the Middle East , in legally sanctioning Russian state murders abroad . It is not the case , of course , that the West has no means of responding to these things . We could selectively murder FSB agents in retaliation for their murders in Western countries , for instance , or quietly transfer large sums of money to the bank accounts of jihadists operating in Russia ’ s northern Caucasus . We don ’ t do such things because we want to uphold the international rules that make us all safer in the long run , because we hope to draw Russia back into working within those rules , and because we don ’ t feel sufficiently threatened as yet .
That prudence should not be mistaken for weakness , however . In early February , U.S. forces in Syria inflicted heavy losses , an estimated 200 dead , on Russian combatants who had attacked a U.S. force and its Kurdish allies . The U.S. has downplayed this incident but not denied it , and the Russians have likewise not complained . Whatever was intended by either side , the U.S. demonstrated that it would respond with deadly force if it needed to do so .
That said , most responses to Russian lawlessness will naturally be “ peaceful ” and/or economic unless Putin becomes ever more reckless . They will likely be such measures as reinforcing NATO troops in the Baltic states ; making modern weapons available to Ukraine against Russia ’ s continuing aggression ; giving far more resources and a freer hand to Western media agencies such as Voice of America , Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty , and the BBC World Service to counter Putin ’ s propaganda apparatus ; holding Russia to account , before international agencies , for unlawful use of chemical weapons ; and imposing economic sanctions on Russian companies and individuals , especially Putin cronies , in Western markets .
These sanctions are usually thought to fall short of what ’ s necessary to change the behavior of the Russian state . But that criticism underestimates both the serious weaknesses of the Russian state and economy and the West ’ s ability to exploit them , as Ronald Reagan did in the early 1980s . Consider the following :
One . Putin has lost Ukraine . Though the Kremlin controlled the whole of Ukraine three years ago through a pro-Kremlin government , it now has only a poor mini-statelet in the Donbass region , for which it pays heavily in blood and treasure . We should remind the Russian public of that repeatedly .
Two . Russia is now losing troops in Syria and gaining relatively little in terms of Russian interests apart from a warm-water port in the Mediterranean . That is useful but comes at a high cost — especially since the main beneficiary of Russian intervention is Iran , which in the long term is more likely to be an enemy of Russia than its friend .
Three . Some strategists regard European reliance on Russian energy supplies as a potential weapon . Doubtless , in the event of an all-out war , that ’ s true . In all lesser circumstances , however , it is a weapon that breaks in the hand of whoever uses it .

Putin may have won his rigged election , but he needn ’ t win his competition with the West — if we respond with seriousness and unity .","Russian president Vladimir Putin (Grigory Dukor/Reuters)

President Putin’s landslide victory in Russia’s presidential election was achieved against the lackluster competition of a group of mediocre candidates from which the sole serious opponent had been excluded; amid plausible allegations that his security services had tried to poison two Russians in England by the use of a chemical nerve agent banned under international law; and with the overwhelming support of Russian news media that reported the attempted murders as a Western plot to weaken and embarrass Russia. It ought to be possible to win a landslide victory in such circumstances without resorting to ballot-stuffing. But according to several reports, that was done too. And, of course, Putin fought the election as a tough patriotic czar who had reintegrated Crimea into Russia, reestablished a strong Russian presence in the Middle East, prevented the European Union from swallowing Ukraine whole, and made Russia feared again, rather than despised, with a massive and technically advanced military buildup. Certain parallels spring to mind.

Is the Russian president sitting pretty, therefore? Too many Western commentators are inclined to treat Putin with a kind of admiring hostility, denouncing him as a lawless despot while grudgingly admitting that the West has no effective way of responding to his ruthless tactics in Ukraine, in the Middle East, in legally sanctioning Russian state murders abroad. It is not the case, of course, that the West has no means of responding to these things. We could selectively murder FSB agents in retaliation for their murders in Western countries, for instance, or quietly transfer large sums of money to the bank accounts of jihadists operating in Russia’s northern Caucasus. We don’t do such things because we want to uphold the international rules that make us all safer in the long run, because we hope to draw Russia back into working within those rules, and because we don’t feel sufficiently threatened as yet.

That prudence should not be mistaken for weakness, however. In early February, U.S. forces in Syria inflicted heavy losses, an estimated 200 dead, on Russian combatants who had attacked a U.S. force and its Kurdish allies. The U.S. has downplayed this incident but not denied it, and the Russians have likewise not complained. Whatever was intended by either side, the U.S. demonstrated that it would respond with deadly force if it needed to do so.

That said, most responses to Russian lawlessness will naturally be “peaceful” and/or economic unless Putin becomes ever more reckless. They will likely be such measures as reinforcing NATO troops in the Baltic states; making modern weapons available to Ukraine against Russia’s continuing aggression; giving far more resources and a freer hand to Western media agencies such as Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and the BBC World Service to counter Putin’s propaganda apparatus; holding Russia to account, before international agencies, for unlawful use of chemical weapons; and imposing economic sanctions on Russian companies and individuals, especially Putin cronies, in Western markets.

These sanctions are usually thought to fall short of what’s necessary to change the behavior of the Russian state. But that criticism underestimates both the serious weaknesses of the Russian state and economy and the West’s ability to exploit them, as Ronald Reagan did in the early 1980s. Consider the following:

One. Putin has lost Ukraine. Though the Kremlin controlled the whole of Ukraine three years ago through a pro-Kremlin government, it now has only a poor mini-statelet in the Donbass region, for which it pays heavily in blood and treasure. We should remind the Russian public of that repeatedly.

Two. Russia is now losing troops in Syria and gaining relatively little in terms of Russian interests apart from a warm-water port in the Mediterranean. That is useful but comes at a high cost — especially since the main beneficiary of Russian intervention is Iran, which in the long term is more likely to be an enemy of Russia than its friend.

Three. Some strategists regard European reliance on Russian energy supplies as a potential weapon. Doubtless, in the event of an all-out war, that’s true. In all lesser circumstances, however, it is a weapon that breaks in the hand of whoever uses it. Even to talk up its potential is to encourage its potential customers to diversify their suppliers, as many are now doing.

Four. Russia is increasing its military (to 4.5 percent of its GDP) at a time when the Russian economy and tax revenue are suffering from the sustained fall in oil prices and the impact of Western sanctions. This is the same combination of contradictory policies that brought the USSR to its knees (though defense spending was far higher in the 1980s).

America and its allies should pursue hard-headed policies against Putin.

We should hope for a fall in Putin’s popularity that prompts a less antagonistic policy toward the West. For that to happen, America and its allies should pursue the hard-headed policies sketched above but be prepared to move toward cooperation if Putin ever signals a less aggressive approach. That’s exactly what Reagan successfully did between 1981 and the Geneva and Reykjavik summits with Gorbachev.

But there are obstacles in the way of trying to repeat this success. Trump in his election campaign plainly wanted a U.S.–Russia deal with Putin even at the risk of fracturing the Western alliance. That wasn’t original to Trump; both Jimmy Carter and Barack Obama aimed at the same thing less candidly. But it’s a foolish policy, doomed to be disappointed. As it happens, Trump was frustrated in his original intentions, and his administration gradually moved toward a conventional conservative-Republican foreign policy. This is to the good, but it is an approach that lacks a presidential voice, because Trump still — with the belated exception of the latest poisonings — refuses to condemn Russia’s condemnable conduct.

In Europe, Germany under its new government — a coalition government with a Christian Democratic majority but with left-wing Social Democrats running foreign policy — is a worrying prospect. The new foreign minister has just described Putin’s Russia as a “difficult partner” but a necessary one, and said Germany will not impose serious sanctions in response to the Salisbury poisonings since they are a “bilateral” Anglo–Russian matter, not something for NATO or the EU. That retreat from Germany’s signature of last week on the joint U.S.-U.K.-Franco-German declaration reflects deep currents in German political culture that unite commercialism, pacifism, and anti-Americanism in a foreign policy that resembles the “Common European Home” theme long advanced in Russian foreign policy.

russia,Fox Online News,2,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/top-gop-judiciary-committee-member-trump-proved-right-on-mueller-probe-as-nadler-warns-of-cover-up,"Top GOP Judiciary Committee member: Trump 'proved right' on Mueller probe, as Nadler warns of 'cover-up'",,Gregg Re,"House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler , D-N.Y. , speaking to `` Fox News Sunday , '' vowed that congressional investigators will press on and continue to investigate President Trump while warning of a possibly unfolding Justice Department `` cover-up , '' even as he acknowledged that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has closed his investigation without indicting a single American for illegally colluding with Russia .
Nadler also asserted that it 's `` way too early to talk about impeachment , '' as Washington awaits Attorney General William Barr 's highly expected release of Mueller 's primary conclusions , which Trump 's personal lawyers tell Fox News is expected Sunday afternoon .
A foundational reason for the launch of the high-profile Mueller probe nearly two years ago was to investigate and prosecute any improper collusion by members of the Trump campaign with Russia , but a senior Justice Department official confirmed on Friday that no new indictments would be coming out of Mueller 's office .
`` All we know is that the special counsel -- what we think we know -- is that the special counsel is not bringing criminal indictments for collusion , '' Nadler told host Chris Wallace . `` There are other investigations going on which he ’ s farmed out , the Southern District of New York , Eastern District of Virginia , and they may or may not . We do know , remember , in plain sight , of a lot of collusion .
`` We know for example that the president ’ s son and his campaign manager were present in the meeting with the Russians , to receive information which they were told in the invitation was part of the Russian government 's attempt to help them in the election , '' Nadler said . `` We know that the campaign manager gave political targeting data to an agent of the Russian government . So we know a lot of things and maybe it ’ s not indictable , but we know there was collusion . The question is the degree . ''
DEMS CIRCLE THE WAGONS DURING FUNEREAL CONFERENCE CALL , AS SENIOR SENATOR ADMITS TRUMP SUPPORTERS MAY HAVE BEEN RIGHT ABOUT MUELLER PROBE
Nadler added : `` The job of Congress is much broader than the job of the special counsel . The special counsel is looking and can only look for crimes . We have to protect the rule of law , we have to look for abuses of power , we have to look for obstructions of justice , we have to look for corruption in the exercise of power which may not be crimes . ''
A former senior law enforcement official told Fox News on Saturday , however , that Democrats lack key investigative powers that Mueller had , including the ability to convene grand juries -- and that Nadler 's path amounted to trying to criminalize meetings with foreign actors that the special counsel apparently determined were simply not criminal .
“ With all the talk of the Democrats intensifying their House investigations , '' the former official said , it was important to note that `` unlike Special Counsel Mueller , Congress and the [ DOJ Inspector General ] can not convene grand juries and initiate prosecutions .

They have an agenda to try and win 2020 . And so what we ’ re seeing is they think that they can go into the Judiciary Committee or any other committee and have a limited budget , limited subpoena power , limited staff and go up against and investigation that lasted 22 months , had unlimited power , unlimited subpoena power , had plenty of investigators -- and they think they can find something more than what they did , then I think they ’ re sadly mistaken .

Would he want to do the things that would actually get into ongoing investigations ? I think the problem is that Democrats and my chairman have a problem . They thought that this report was going to show something they could impeach the president on . That is not seemingly going to happen . ''
Nadler separately took a shot at Trump for his criticisms of the intelligence community as hopelessly biased . Senior members of the FBI investigative team who probed Trump 's campaign have since been fired or resigned following the revelations that they exchanged numerous anti-Trump text messages during the campaign ( even as thousands of other texts were deleted by what the agency called a `` glitch '' ) , surveilled a Trump campaign aide using a warrant that relied heavily on a politically biased source working for a firm hired by the Clinton campaign , and illegally leaked information to the media without authorization .
`` It is part of a sustained attack by the administration and its allies on the integrity of law enforcement agencies , the FBI , the special prosecutor , for the last two years to try to undermine the integrity and the credibility of our law enforcement institutions , and that ’ s something that ’ s very damaging to the country , '' Nadler said , referring to Trump .","House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., speaking to ""Fox News Sunday,"" vowed that congressional investigators will press on and continue to investigate President Trump while warning of a possibly unfolding Justice Department ""cover-up,"" even as he acknowledged that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has closed his investigation without indicting a single American for illegally colluding with Russia.

Nadler also asserted that it's ""way too early to talk about impeachment,"" as Washington awaits Attorney General William Barr's highly expected release of Mueller's primary conclusions, which Trump's personal lawyers tell Fox News is expected Sunday afternoon.

A foundational reason for the launch of the high-profile Mueller probe nearly two years ago was to investigate and prosecute any improper collusion by members of the Trump campaign with Russia, but a senior Justice Department official confirmed on Friday that no new indictments would be coming out of Mueller's office.

""All we know is that the special counsel -- what we think we know -- is that the special counsel is not bringing criminal indictments for collusion,"" Nadler told host Chris Wallace. ""There are other investigations going on which he’s farmed out, the Southern District of New York, Eastern District of Virginia, and they may or may not. We do know, remember, in plain sight, of a lot of collusion.

""We know for example that the president’s son and his campaign manager were present in the meeting with the Russians, to receive information which they were told in the invitation was part of the Russian government's attempt to help them in the election,"" Nadler said. ""We know that the campaign manager gave political targeting data to an agent of the Russian government. So we know a lot of things and maybe it’s not indictable, but we know there was collusion. The question is the degree.""

DEMS CIRCLE THE WAGONS DURING FUNEREAL CONFERENCE CALL, AS SENIOR SENATOR ADMITS TRUMP SUPPORTERS MAY HAVE BEEN RIGHT ABOUT MUELLER PROBE

Nadler added: ""The job of Congress is much broader than the job of the special counsel. The special counsel is looking and can only look for crimes. We have to protect the rule of law, we have to look for abuses of power, we have to look for obstructions of justice, we have to look for corruption in the exercise of power which may not be crimes.""

A former senior law enforcement official told Fox News on Saturday, however, that Democrats lack key investigative powers that Mueller had, including the ability to convene grand juries -- and that Nadler's path amounted to trying to criminalize meetings with foreign actors that the special counsel apparently determined were simply not criminal.

“With all the talk of the Democrats intensifying their House investigations,"" the former official said, it was important to note that ""unlike Special Counsel Mueller, Congress and the [DOJ Inspector General] cannot convene grand juries and initiate prosecutions. If Mueller couldn't find collusion or conspiracy with every investigative tool, what do the Democrats expect to accomplish?""

russia,Associated Press,1,https://apnews.com/34a86b701b304013a95b339ce16cf82d,Acting AG overseeing Mueller probe says he’s not interfered,2019-02-08,"Eric Tucker, Mary Clare Jalonick","WASHINGTON ( AP ) — Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker said on Friday that he has “ not interfered in any way ” in the special counsel ’ s Russia investigation as he faced a contentious and partisan congressional hearing in his waning days on the job .
The hearing before the House Judiciary Committee was the first , and likely only , chance for newly empowered Democrats in the majority to grill an attorney general they perceive as a Donald Trump loyalist and whose appointment they suspect was aimed at suppressing investigations of the Republican president . They confronted Whitaker on his past criticism of special counsel Robert Mueller ’ s work and his refusal to recuse himself from overseeing it , attacked him over his prior business dealings and sneeringly challenged his credentials as the country ’ s chief law enforcement officer .
“ We ’ re all trying to figure out : Who are you , where did you come from and how the heck did you become the head of the Department of Justice , ” said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries . When Whitaker tried to respond , the New York Democrat interrupted , “ Mr . Whitaker , that was a statement , not a question . I assume you know the difference . ”

The hearing before the House Judiciary Committee was the first, and likely only, chance for newly empowered Democrats in the majority to grill an attorney general they perceive as a Donald Trump loyalist and whose appointment they suspect was aimed at suppressing investigations of the Republican president. They confronted Whitaker on his past criticism of special counsel Robert Mueller’s work and his refusal to recuse himself from overseeing it, attacked him over his prior business dealings and sneeringly challenged his credentials as the country’s chief law enforcement officer.

“We’re all trying to figure out: Who are you, where did you come from and how the heck did you become the head of the Department of Justice,” said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries. When Whitaker tried to respond, the New York Democrat interrupted, “Mr. Whitaker, that was a statement, not a question. I assume you know the difference.”

`` Now it seems our American partners believe that the situation has changed so much that [ they ] must also have such a weapon , '' he said .
`` What 's our response ? It 's simple - in that case we will also do this . ''
US President Donald Trump has previously said the country would leave the treaty because of Russian actions .
Analysts say Russia sees the weapons as a cheaper alternative to conventional forces .
Arriving for talks with Nato foreign ministers , EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini urged the two countries to save the treaty , saying it had `` guaranteed peace and security in European territory for 30 years now '' .
On Tuesday , the Western military alliance formally accused Russia of breaking the treaty .
`` Allies have concluded that Russia has developed and fielded a missile system , the 9M729 , which violates the INF Treaty and poses significant risks to Euro-Atlantic security , '' the Nato foreign ministers ' statement read .
The statement said the member nations `` strongly support '' the US claim that Russia is in breach of the pact , and called on Moscow to `` return urgently to full and verifiable compliance '' .
Speaking after the release of Nato 's statement , US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Russia had 60 days to return to compliance with the treaty , after which time the US would suspend its own compliance .
`` During this 60 days we will still not test or produce or deploy any systems , and we 'll see what happens during this 60-day period , '' he said .
Signed by the US and the USSR in 1987 , the arms control deal banned all nuclear and non-nuclear missiles with short and medium ranges , except sea-launched weapons
The US had been concerned by the Soviet deployment of the SS-20 missile system and responded by placing Pershing and cruise missiles in Europe - sparking widespread protests
In 2007 , Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the treaty no longer served Russia 's interests
The move came after the US withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002
In 2014 , then US President Barack Obama accused Russia of breaching the INF Treaty after it allegedly tested a ground-launched cruise missile .
He reportedly chose not to withdraw from the treaty under pressure from European leaders , who said such a move could restart an arms race .
The last time the US withdrew from a major arms treaty was in 2002 , when President George W Bush pulled the US out of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty , which banned weapons designed to counter ballistic nuclear missiles .
His administration 's move to set up a missile shield in Europe alarmed the Kremlin , and was scrapped by the Obama administration in 2009 . It was replaced by a modified defence system in 2016 .","Image copyright EPA Image caption Russian President Vladimir Putin said Nato's accusation was a pretext for the US to leave the treaty

Russia will develop missiles banned under a Cold War agreement if the US exits the pact, President Vladimir Putin has warned.

His comments follow Nato's accusation on Tuesday that Russia has already broken the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty.

Signed in 1987 by the US and USSR, it banned both countries' use of all short and medium-range missiles.

In televised comments, the Russian leader said many other countries had developed weapons banned under the INF treaty.

""Now it seems our American partners believe that the situation has changed so much that [they] must also have such a weapon,"" he said.

""What's our response? It's simple - in that case we will also do this.""

US President Donald Trump has previously said the country would leave the treaty because of Russian actions.

Analysts say Russia sees the weapons as a cheaper alternative to conventional forces.

Arriving for talks with Nato foreign ministers, EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini urged the two countries to save the treaty, saying it had ""guaranteed peace and security in European territory for 30 years now"".

What has Nato said?

On Tuesday, the Western military alliance formally accused Russia of breaking the treaty.

""Allies have concluded that Russia has developed and fielded a missile system, the 9M729, which violates the INF Treaty and poses significant risks to Euro-Atlantic security,"" the Nato foreign ministers' statement read.

The statement said the member nations ""strongly support"" the US claim that Russia is in breach of the pact, and called on Moscow to ""return urgently to full and verifiable compliance"".

Speaking after the release of Nato's statement, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Russia had 60 days to return to compliance with the treaty, after which time the US would suspend its own compliance.

""During this 60 days we will still not test or produce or deploy any systems, and we'll see what happens during this 60-day period,"" he said.

Russia has repeatedly denied breaking the Cold War treaty.

What is the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty?

Image copyright AFP Image caption Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and US President Ronald Reagan signed the INF Treaty in 1987

Signed by the US and the USSR in 1987, the arms control deal banned all nuclear and non-nuclear missiles with short and medium ranges, except sea-launched weapons

The US had been concerned by the Soviet deployment of the SS-20 missile system and responded by placing Pershing and cruise missiles in Europe - sparking widespread protests

By 1991, nearly 2,700 missiles had been destroyed

Both countries were allowed to inspect the other's installations

In 2007, Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the treaty no longer served Russia's interests

The move came after the US withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002

In 2014, then US President Barack Obama accused Russia of breaching the INF Treaty after it allegedly tested a ground-launched cruise missile.

He reportedly chose not to withdraw from the treaty under pressure from European leaders, who said such a move could restart an arms race.

The last time the US withdrew from a major arms treaty was in 2002, when President George W Bush pulled the US out of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which banned weapons designed to counter ballistic nuclear missiles.

His administration's move to set up a missile shield in Europe alarmed the Kremlin, and was scrapped by the Obama administration in 2009. It was replaced by a modified defence system in 2016.",www.bbc.com,center,2MtDvDSHgmBd2Xkj

( AP ) — The United States vowed Friday to keep the pressure on Syria after the intense nighttime wave of missile strikes from U.S. ships , despite the prospect of escalating Russian ill will that could further inflame one of the world 's most vexing conflicts .
Standing firm , the Trump administration signaled new sanctions would soon follow the missile attack , and the Pentagon was even probing whether Russia itself was involved in the chemical weapons assault that compelled President Donald Trump to action . The attack against a Syrian air base was the first U.S. assault against the government of President Bashar Assad .
Much of the international community rallied behind Trump 's decision to fire the cruise missiles in reaction to this week 's chemical weapons attack that killed dozens of men , women and children in Syria . But a spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that the strikes dealt `` a significant blow '' to relations between Moscow and Washington .
At the United Nations , Russia 's deputy ambassador , Vladimir Safronkov , strongly criticized what he called the U.S. `` flagrant violation of international law and an act of aggression '' whose `` consequences for regional and international security could be extremely serious . '' He called the Assad government a main force against terrorism and said it deserved the presumption of innocence in the chemical weapons attack .
`` The world is waiting for the Russian government to act responsibly in Syria , '' Nikki Haley , the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. , said during an emergency Security Council session . `` The world is waiting for Russia to reconsider its misplaced alliance with Bashar Assad . ''
Haley said the U.S. was prepared to take further action in Syria but hoped it would n't be necessary .
In Florida with the president , meanwhile , Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said : `` We will be announcing additional sanctions on Syria as part of our ongoing effort to stop this type of activity and emphasize how significant we view this . We expect that those will continue to have an important effect on preventing people from doing business with them . ''
Thursday night 's strikes — some 60 cruise missiles fired from two ships in the Mediterranean — were the culmination of a rapid , three-day transformation for Trump , who has long opposed deeper U.S. involvement in Syria 's civil war . Advisers said he was outraged by heartbreaking images of young children who were among the dozens killed in the chemical attack and ordered his national security team to swiftly prepare military options .
The decision undercut another campaign promise for Trump : his pledge to try to warm relations with Moscow . After months of allegations of ties between his election campaign and the Kremlin — the subject of current congressional and FBI investigations — Trump has found himself clashing with Putin .
On Friday , senior U.S. military officials were looking more closely at possible Russian involvement in the poison attack . Officials said a drone belonging to either Russia or Syria was seen hovering over the site after the assault earlier this week . The drone returned late in the day as citizens were going to a nearby hospital for treatment . Shortly afterward , officials say the hospital was targeted .
The officials , who insisted on anonymity in order to discuss the sensitive matter , said they believe the hospital attack may have been an effort to cover up evidence of the earlier assault .
White House officials caution that Trump is not preparing to plunge the U.S. deeper into Syria . Spokesman Sean Spicer said the missile attack sent a clear message to Assad , but he avoided explicitly calling for the Syrian to leave office .
`` The president believes that the Syrian government , the Assad regime , should at the minimum agree to abide by the agreements they made to not use chemical weapons , '' Spicer said when asked if Assad should step down .
The impact of the strikes was also unclear . Despite intense international pressure , Assad has clung to power since a civil war broke out in his country six years ago , helped by financial and military support from both Russia and Iran . Russian military personnel and aircraft are embedded with Syria 's , and Iranian troops and paramilitary forces are also on the ground helping Assad fight the array of opposition groups hoping to topple him .

Instead of the `` total exoneration '' Trump had proclaimed earlier , the report portrayed the President as deceitful and paranoid encouraging his aides to withhold the truth and cross ethical lines in an attempt to thwart a probe into Russia 's interference in US elections -- his `` Achilles heel , '' according to one forthcoming adviser .
Perhaps more angering to a leader who detests weakness -- but does n't necessarily mind an amoral reputation -- were the number of underlings shown ignoring his commands , privately scoffing at the `` crazy sh * * '' he was requesting and working around him to avoid self-implication .
Now , those close to him say Trump is newly furious at the people -- most of whom no longer work for him -- whose extensive interviews with the special counsel 's office created the epic depiction of an unscrupulous and chaotic White House . And he 's seeking assurances from those who remain that his orders are being treated like those of a president , and not like suggestions from an intemperate but misguided supervisor .
`` Because I never agreed to testify , it was not necessary for me to respond to statements made in the 'Report ' about me , some of which are total bullshit & only given to make the other person look good ( or me to look bad ) , '' Trump tweeted on Friday morning as he waited out a rainstorm in Florida before proceeding to his golf course for a round with conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh .
Some current and former officials who accurately predicted that details in the Mueller report would be embarrassing for the White House are now questioning the legal strategy to fully cooperate with the Mueller investigation .
One official who sat down with the special counsel noted that they did so at the behest of the former White House legal team , John Dowd and Ty Cobb , who provided a wealth of documents and encouraged senior officials to be interviewed . It was because of these interviews with people closest to the President that Mueller and his team were able to get a cinematic look at the deceit and trickery taking place in the West Wing .
While these people are critical , the full cooperation was a strategy to make it hard for Mueller to push for an interview given all the information he was given . It was a strategy that worked , even if there is some political embarrassment .
The President was aware ahead of its public release what was contained in the Mueller report . Attorney General Bill Barr told reporters Thursday that both the White House counsel and Trump 's personal legal team were given an opportunity to read the redacted version in the previous days .
But Trump grew angry as he watched cable news coverage because , sources familiar with the matter said , a theme was emerging that vexed him : a portrait of a dishonest president who is regularly managed , restrained or ignored by his staff .
It was a sharp turn away from his earlier statements , which welcomed the report 's findings on collusion and falsely claimed total exoneration . Hours before his Mar-a-Lago dinner , Trump insisted to a crowd on the tarmac in Florida the dark days of Mueller 's special counsel investigation had ended .
`` Game over , folks , '' he said over the sounds of a busy airport . `` Now , it 's back to work . ''
It 's hard to tell , however , what Trump intends to head back to . Mueller 's probe and Trump 's constant focus on it have been the backdrop for all but a few months of the presidency , often diminishing whatever policy efforts have been orchestrated by officials or Republican lawmakers . The report depicts a President who for two years has been largely consumed by the Russia investigation , intent on short-circuiting it but repeatedly stymied in his efforts by aides .
A senior administration official told CNN 's Jake Tapper that dynamic was `` nothing surprising . ''
`` That the President makes absurd demands of his staff and administration officials -- who are alarmed by them and reluctant to follow them -- is not only unsurprising but has become the norm , '' the official said .
Nevertheless , in the past Trump has resisted the idea that he is being controlled by those around him or that they are responsible for his successes . Sources familiar with how the West Wing operates said attempts to subvert the President 's demands have not ceased now that the Mueller investigation is over . There have been instances in recent weeks where aides have slow walked or ignored Trump 's directives , hoping he will forget he gave them .
What is clear is many of those who avoided carrying out Trump 's demands related to Mueller 's probe -- often , it seemed , in a bid to protect themselves from criminal wrongdoing -- are no longer employed by the White House . Instead , the aides who now surround the President appear less willing to write him off and more likely to encourage him to follow his gut .
Among those who have moved on : the White House counsel who refused Trump 's demand to fire Mueller , the chief of staff and senior adviser who anxiously tried to retrieve a resignation letter from the attorney general , the staff secretary who declined Trump 's order to gauge the loyalty of a Justice Department official , the attorney general who refused to un-recuse himself and the communications chief who seemed most expert in Trump 's whims .
Even Steve Bannon , once viewed as the ultimate advocate for following Trump 's instincts , is depicted in the report as a constraining force . In one instance , when the President tried to claim Mueller had a conflict of interest because of a membership dispute at a Trump golf club , Bannon wrote it off as `` ridiculous and petty . '' Trump and Bannon parted ways in the summer of 2017 and have not reconciled since .
Instead , the most prominent aides who do remain are depicted in the report as the most dishonest . Press secretary Sarah Sanders , who was out the office when the report was released , is shown repeatedly misleading the press , a fact she attempted to downplay in morning television interviews on Friday .
`` ( Trump ) has never asked me to break the law , '' she said on CBS . `` When the President wants to do something and make a decision , he does it . He 's not somebody who sit around and ponders . I think you guys have seen that day in and day out . One minute you 're running stories saying the staff ca n't control him and the next minute everyone 's saying thank God the staff could control him . You do n't get to have it both ways . ''

Among those who Trump dined with in Florida on Thursday was Mick Mulvaney , the chief of staff who still fills the role in an acting capacity but who , according to officials , has done less than either of his two predecessors to restrain Trump in his hardline instincts .
Indeed , since Mulvaney 's tenure began at the start of the year , Trump has overseen the longest government shutdown in US history , a dramatic shakeup at the Department of Homeland Security , a sharp turn toward harsher policies on the border , a decision to ask a court to scrap the entire Affordable Care Act and a confusing dictate on North Korea sanctions that still has advisers scratching their heads .
People familiar with Mulvaney 's style say those outcomes are n't necessarily his doing , but rather the result of a President newly empowered to follow his impulses without the restrictions placed on him by previous aides . Sources say the President has also come to rely on his chief of staff less than he did during the reign of Reince Priebus or John Kelly , when he would often call his top aide nearly a dozen times a day . Mulvaney has told colleagues there are days he barely hears from the President .
In his report , Mueller describes both of Mulvaney 's predecessors -- Priebus and Kelly -- as working in at least some capacity to contain the damage of Trump 's behavior . Priebus is shown making an urgent ( and vaguely comic ) effort to recover a resignation letter from then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions that Trump had kept , believing it would amount to a `` shock collar '' on the Justice Department because it was not dated and aides feared Trump could employ it at his leisure .
Kelly told Mueller that when Trump wanted to meet with friends who encouraged his impulses , such as former campaign aide Corey Lewandowski , he tried to push them to the private residence `` to create distance from the West Wing . ''
Trump soured on Priebus and Kelly long before he summarily terminated each of their tenures . So , too , had Trump grown wary of former White House counsel Don McGahn , who sat for more than 30 hours of testimony with Mueller 's team . Trump grew irate again at his former aide late Thursday and into Friday .
In the report , Trump is described as having several tense encounters with McGahn during his White House tenure , including episodes when McGahn was prepared to resign rather than carry out Trump 's demands .
McGahn described Trump asking him to do `` crazy sh * * , '' according to Priebus . Trump , meanwhile , deemed McGahn a `` lying bastard '' whose habit of taking contemporaneous notes raised suspicion . In an anecdote relayed in the report , Trump and McGahn went back-and-forth over the note-taking , which Trump insisted good lawyers -- such as his onetime counsel Roy Cohn -- never did .
Trump had n't backed off that view by Friday morning , when he made clear on Twitter his frustrations at the report .
`` Watch out for people that take so-called 'notes , ' when the notes never existed until needed , '' the President wrote .","Washington (CNN) By the time President Donald Trump had passed through the prime rib buffet at Mar-a-Lago on Thursday to sit for dinner with family and a top aide, the damning picture Robert Mueller's report painted of his presidency had become clear.

The President was aware ahead of its public release what was contained in the Mueller report. Attorney General Bill Barr told reporters Thursday that both the White House counsel and Trump's personal legal team were given an opportunity to read the redacted version in the previous days.

Mounting anger

But Trump grew angry as he watched cable news coverage because, sources familiar with the matter said, a theme was emerging that vexed him: a portrait of a dishonest president who is regularly managed, restrained or ignored by his staff.

It was a sharp turn away from his earlier statements, which welcomed the report's findings on collusion and falsely claimed total exoneration. Hours before his Mar-a-Lago dinner, Trump insisted to a crowd on the tarmac in Florida the dark days of Mueller's special counsel investigation had ended.

""Game over, folks,"" he said over the sounds of a busy airport. ""Now, it's back to work.""

It's hard to tell, however, what Trump intends to head back to. Mueller's probe and Trump's constant focus on it have been the backdrop for all but a few months of the presidency, often diminishing whatever policy efforts have been orchestrated by officials or Republican lawmakers. The report depicts a President who for two years has been largely consumed by the Russia investigation, intent on short-circuiting it but repeatedly stymied in his efforts by aides.

A senior administration official told CNN's Jake Tapper that dynamic was ""nothing surprising.""

""That the President makes absurd demands of his staff and administration officials -- who are alarmed by them and reluctant to follow them -- is not only unsurprising but has become the norm,"" the official said.

Nevertheless, in the past Trump has resisted the idea that he is being controlled by those around him or that they are responsible for his successes. Sources familiar with how the West Wing operates said attempts to subvert the President's demands have not ceased now that the Mueller investigation is over. There have been instances in recent weeks where aides have slow walked or ignored Trump's directives, hoping he will forget he gave them.

What is clear is many of those who avoided carrying out Trump's demands related to Mueller's probe -- often, it seemed, in a bid to protect themselves from criminal wrongdoing -- are no longer employed by the White House. Instead, the aides who now surround the President appear less willing to write him off and more likely to encourage him to follow his gut.

Among those who have moved on: the White House counsel who refused Trump's demand to fire Mueller, the chief of staff and senior adviser who anxiously tried to retrieve a resignation letter from the attorney general, the staff secretary who declined Trump's order to gauge the loyalty of a Justice Department official, the attorney general who refused to un-recuse himself and the communications chief who seemed most expert in Trump's whims.

Even Steve Bannon, once viewed as the ultimate advocate for following Trump's instincts, is depicted in the report as a constraining force. In one instance, when the President tried to claim Mueller had a conflict of interest because of a membership dispute at a Trump golf club, Bannon wrote it off as ""ridiculous and petty."" Trump and Bannon parted ways in the summer of 2017 and have not reconciled since.

Instead, the most prominent aides who do remain are depicted in the report as the most dishonest. Press secretary Sarah Sanders, who was out the office when the report was released, is shown repeatedly misleading the press , a fact she attempted to downplay in morning television interviews on Friday.

""(Trump) has never asked me to break the law,"" she said on CBS. ""When the President wants to do something and make a decision, he does it. He's not somebody who sit around and ponders. I think you guys have seen that day in and day out. One minute you're running stories saying the staff can't control him and the next minute everyone's saying thank God the staff could control him. You don't get to have it both ways.""

Increasingly untethered

Among those who Trump dined with in Florida on Thursday was Mick Mulvaney, the chief of staff who still fills the role in an acting capacity but who, according to officials, has done less than either of his two predecessors to restrain Trump in his hardline instincts.

Indeed, since Mulvaney's tenure began at the start of the year, Trump has overseen the longest government shutdown in US history, a dramatic shakeup at the Department of Homeland Security, a sharp turn toward harsher policies on the border, a decision to ask a court to scrap the entire Affordable Care Act and a confusing dictate on North Korea sanctions that still has advisers scratching their heads.

People familiar with Mulvaney's style say those outcomes aren't necessarily his doing, but rather the result of a President newly empowered to follow his impulses without the restrictions placed on him by previous aides. Sources say the President has also come to rely on his chief of staff less than he did during the reign of Reince Priebus or John Kelly, when he would often call his top aide nearly a dozen times a day. Mulvaney has told colleagues there are days he barely hears from the President.

In his report, Mueller describes both of Mulvaney's predecessors -- Priebus and Kelly -- as working in at least some capacity to contain the damage of Trump's behavior. Priebus is shown making an urgent (and vaguely comic) effort to recover a resignation letter from then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions that Trump had kept, believing it would amount to a ""shock collar"" on the Justice Department because it was not dated and aides feared Trump could employ it at his leisure.

Kelly told Mueller that when Trump wanted to meet with friends who encouraged his impulses, such as former campaign aide Corey Lewandowski, he tried to push them to the private residence ""to create distance from the West Wing.""

Trump soured on Priebus and Kelly long before he summarily terminated each of their tenures. So, too, had Trump grown wary of former White House counsel Don McGahn, who sat for more than 30 hours of testimony with Mueller's team. Trump grew irate again at his former aide late Thursday and into Friday.

In the report, Trump is described as having several tense encounters with McGahn during his White House tenure, including episodes when McGahn was prepared to resign rather than carry out Trump's demands.

McGahn described Trump asking him to do ""crazy sh**,"" according to Priebus. Trump, meanwhile, deemed McGahn a ""lying bastard"" whose habit of taking contemporaneous notes raised suspicion. In an anecdote relayed in the report, Trump and McGahn went back-and-forth over the note-taking, which Trump insisted good lawyers -- such as his onetime counsel Roy Cohn -- never did.

Trump hadn't backed off that view by Friday morning, when he made clear on Twitter his frustrations at the report.

Sanger, Nicole Perlroth","From The New York Times , I ’ m Michael Barbaro . This is “ The Daily. ” Today : A Times investigation reveals that the United States is actively infiltrating Russia ’ s electric power grid . David Sanger on what that means for the future of cyber warfare . It ’ s Tuesday , June 18 .
So what happened in 2008 was the Russians did something pretty brilliant . They dropped a bunch of USB keys — you know , the kind you might get at a convention or maybe that ’ s given to you at a hotel — in parking lots around American bases in the Middle East . People would pick these things up , bring them into work , and , believe it or not , put them in their computers at work .
archived recording Somebody got away with the most serious breach of Defense Department computer networks ever .
And what happened was those keys essentially put some malware into computers that got the Russians inside something called SIPRNet .
archived recording The drive contained malicious coding that spread through classified files and stole information .
The official name is the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network , but the main thing to know is it ’ s the Pentagon ’ s secret network .
archived recording We didn ’ t think that was possible because it ’ s completely separate from the internet .
And suddenly , they were able to drain out of the Pentagon some of its most secret communications , all because somebody picked up a USB and stuck it in their machines . And one day , a woman named Debbie Plunkett came into the office at the N.S.A . Remember , this was just ahead of President Obama ’ s election . And she discovered this breach , and basically she said , we ’ ve got to get them out . And this started a massive effort secretly inside the N.S.A . to clean out the Department of Defense ’ s systems . In fact , after a while , people began using superglue to seal the USB ports on Pentagon computers —
— so that no idiot would go pick up a USB from someplace and put it in . It was a low-tech solution , Michael , but it worked .
So beyond supergluing the USB ports on computers inside the Defense Department , what is the response from the U.S. to this incursion ?
The response was near-panic . I mean , think about what had happened just in that year or two . The Chinese had gotten inside Lockheed Martin and stolen many of the designs for the F-35 , the most expensive fighter jet that you ’ ve ever paid for . And that ’ s why the Chinese today are producing what looks like an F-35 , although it ’ s a lot cheaper than ours . The United States was launching its own big , sophisticated cyber operation against Iran ’ s nuclear enrichment plant at Natanz . And the Russians , of course , were coming inside the Pentagon . And everybody realized , this is now not just a big intelligence problem . This is a big military problem , and we don ’ t have a military unit of size and sophistication to deal with it . And that was the birth of what is now United States Cyber Command .
So what does this newly established Cyber Command do about Russia , the culprit of this really damaging attack on the Pentagon ?
Initially , Michael , not much . U.S. Cyber Command was just getting organized . It didn ’ t have many troops . It didn ’ t have much expertise . It was based at Fort Meade , but it was highly dependent on its next-door neighbor , the National Security Agency , for most of its capability to look inside networks , much less attack back . So they spent years sort of watching the Russians and building their forces , building cyber sort of expeditionary teams that they could put out with American Army units and Navy units and the Air Force and others . But the big concern was what do you do in time of warfare when the Russians or the Chinese or some other adversary might do more than just get into your communications networks ? They might go in to try to change data , like supposing they altered the targeting on a missile . Supposing they just got into the medical database and changed the blood type of every soldier and sailor , you can imagine the havoc that they would bring about . So the question was how would you find them , how would you counter them , and then , what ’ s the right retaliation ? What ’ s the deterrent to keep them from doing that ? Of course while the U.S. was having this debate , there were some real attacks happening .
archived recording 1 The White House is considering a response to the crippling cyberattack on Sony Pictures . archived recording 2 Federal officials are pointing right at the source . They say the attack was launched from inside North Korea .
The North Koreans went into Sony because they didn ’ t like a bad movie called “ The Interview , ” and they took out 70 percent of Sony Pictures Entertainment ’ s computer systems .
archived recording 1 It raises huge questions about vulnerability and national security . archived recording 2 They call this new kind of attack cyber extortion .
And suddenly the Obama administration had a debate . What do we do in retaliation ? Well , the answer was they put a few sanctions on the North Koreans , and they cut off their internet access through China for a day or two , but not much . And then , of course , the Chinese came in , and they stole 22 million security files from the Office of Personnel Management . That ’ s the office that does security reviews for everybody applying for a clearance .
archived recording O.P.M . did not specifically say what information the hackers got their hands on , but it could include everything from names to Social Security numbers .
So suddenly the Chinese had all this information about 7 percent of the U.S. population , a very elite 7 percent .
archived recording 1 We ’ ve learned the breach goes back 30 years to 1985 and affects nearly every government agency . archived recording 2 One of the largest thefts of U.S. government data ever .
And no one knew what to go do in response other than try to negotiate some agreement about not stealing intellectual property with the Chinese . But all this was very frustrating inside Cyber Command and inside the N.S.A. , because the number of attacks on the United States was expanding like mad . It reached its high point , really , in 2016 , when the election attacks happened from Russia . And it wasn ’ t just the election system they were into , because at the same time that the Obama White House was beginning to understand what was happening as the Russians got into the registration systems in Illinois and Arizona and all that , they were getting this other stream of intelligence about much more aggressive attacks on nuclear power plants , on regular power plants . The Russians got into a communications system in a nuclear power plant that ’ s in Kansas that caused all kinds of disruption . And suddenly we were beginning to see warnings coming out of the Department of Homeland Security and the F.B.I. , saying , hey , every utility in America — not just the power companies , but people who ran gas pipelines and water systems and all that , had to be on the lookout for malware , and that could cripple you . It ’ s not that the Russians had used that to go turn off the lights yet . They hadn ’ t , at least in the United States , but that they were prepared to do so .
So David , you ’ ve described a series of cyberattacks against the U.S. by its adversaries that are escalating in their brazenness . So why does it seem that this Cyber Command , which was created specifically to defend the U.S. against these kinds of attacks , isn ’ t doing very much about it ?
Well , for a couple of reasons . First , the primary defense for the United States is supposed to come from the Department of Homeland Security . The Pentagon was only supposed to get into this game when the attacks became so severe that they threatened the viability of the United States . The second reason is that Cyber Command didn ’ t really have the authorities to do much more than defend the Pentagon . That ’ s what its legal authority was . And there was this great frustration , because everybody inside Cyber Command and the N.S.A . and many others realized that no foreign adversary was paying much of a price for attacking the United States . But then this remarkable moment came , because President Trump ended up nominating —
archived recording The meeting will come to order . The committee meets today to —
archived recording — consider the nomination of Lieutenant General Paul Nakasone to be commander of the U.S. Cyber Command and director —
He was nominated as the new head of the United States Cyber Command and the director of the N.S.A . One person holds both jobs .
And he came up in March of 2018 for his confirmation hearing , and he is asked by Senator Dan Sullivan from Alaska —
archived recording ( dan sullivan ) What do you think our adversaries think right now ? If you do a cyberattack on America , what ’ s going to happen to them ?
So what do you think our adversaries think about us right now ?
archived recording ( paul nakasone ) They do not think that much will happen to them . archived recording ( dan sullivan ) They don ’ t fear us . archived recording ( paul nakasone ) They don ’ t fear us . archived recording ( dan sullivan ) So is that good ?
archived recording ( paul nakasone ) It is not good , Senator . archived recording ( dan sullivan ) So will you —
Well , he didn ’ t say this in public , but what he had been proposing for years was a concept really drawn from American Special Forces , which is defend forward . Don ’ t wait to get attacked . You know , the Special Forces has learned in the war on terror that if you ’ re going to stop a terror attack in Times Square , you better go hit the living room in Pakistan where it ’ s being planned . And Nakasone sort of had the same concept , which is the United States has to have what he called persistent presence in foreign computer networks around the world , because if you aren ’ t already buried inside that network , you were never going to see an attack coming , and you wouldn ’ t have any way to retaliate .
In other words , you have to go on the offense to really be on the defense .
And you have to live in your adversaries ’ networks . You have to be inside their computers before they attack you , not after . And he was confirmed , and that began a real new era for how Cyber Command went on the offense .
We ’ ll be right back . So David , you ’ ve spent the past few months trying to understand what it means for the Trump administration to go on the offense when it comes to cyber . What exactly have you found ?
Well , the first thing I found was that the Trump administration and Congress enabled Cyber Command to go on the offense much more aggressively than they had been before . In August of 2018 , President Trump signed a long-awaited executive order . It was called National Security Presidential Memorandum 13 . Its contents are still classified , but essentially it allows the Cyber Command to go ahead and conduct all kinds of operations inside foreign networks without going back to the president for prior approval . Our computer networks around the country were under such a constant barrage of attacks that Cyber Command needed much more freedom to be able to get inside those foreign networks and begin to combat it and that it couldn ’ t be going to the White House every time it wanted to do this , just the way the Navy doesn ’ t go to the White House every time it wants to go run a group of destroyers down through the South China Sea or go do patrolling along the DMZ in South Korea .
In other words , it ’ s an acknowledgment that cyber is such an active place that the president could spend his entire day signing off on every decision that needed to be made .
That ’ s right , and Congress authorized Cyber Command to do even more . It basically said these kind of operations in cyberspace are part of traditional military activity , and you ’ re authorized to go ahead and do them the same way that you would do ordinary patrols .
And so what does this newly empowered Cyber Command do with this authority ?
Well , the first thing it did was go after those units in Russia that were responsible for a lot of the election-hacking . They shut down the Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg , which , of course , had designed many of those Facebook ads and other social media ads , for a couple of days right around the midterm elections . They went after the G.R.U. , the Russian military intelligence unit that had been responsible for breaking into the D.N.C . and then making public much of that data . They sent text messages to individual Russian officers and hackers saying , we know who you are . We know where you live . We know your phone number , and if you mess with us , you ’ re going to pay a price . So a lot of that action to counter the election malfeasance was made public . What wasn ’ t made public was a parallel effort to go inside the Russian power grid , to put some code in places where the Russians would see it as a warning , but put other code in places where the Russians wouldn ’ t see it , in case the U.S. ever needed to act against Russia ’ s utilities as the Russians were putting malware in our systems .
So the U.S. now has the ability to interfere with the Russian power grid in the same way that Russia can already interfere with the U.S. power grid .
That ’ s right . The U.S. wanted to get deep inside the Russian systems , this time not just for surveillance but to be able to place malware there , basically ticking time bombs or what you might think of as digital landmines that they could set off if we got into a broader conflict with the Russians .
David , how significant is it that the U.S. took this step of basically infiltrating Russia ’ s electric grid ?
Oh , I think it ’ s a big step , Michael , but it ’ s also a pretty risky one . So classic deterrence theory would tell you , do like in the nuclear age , right ? If they can hit you , show them you can hit them back . But I think the Russians have some doubts that we ’ d really be willing to pull the plug . They know that we ’ re limited by all kinds of legal and ethical considerations and that unplugging a country , except in the midst of a war , would cause a lot of civilian deaths . The people who are most vulnerable if you unplug the grid are people in hospitals or nursing homes . So there ’ d be a great reluctance to cause civilian casualties .
It might be , but one of the remarkable things about cyber is how well you can go hide the causes of a cyberattack . Most cyber is used in short-of-war conflicts , not full-scale war , but instead this quiet war of attrition where countries are trying to seek advantage or gain power by manipulating the data in your financial systems or making A.T.M.s unavailable or turning off the power in certain parts of the city , but maybe not in others . So it ’ s pretty subtle . And the Russians are really smart . They do not want to trigger a general military conflict between the U.S. and Russia . Most other countries don ’ t either . So they want to use their cyber capability in the most subtle way possible .
David , given that , as you just said , the battlefield is much more subtle when it comes to cyber than traditional warfare , but the consequences just as significant , at what point does Cyber Command , do all these officials with these new powers granted by the Trump administration , at what point do they need to seek the approval of the president and of Congress to conduct these operations , like entering the Russian electrical grid , in the way that they would for traditional warfare ?
It ’ s a fascinating question , because if you look at the law , and from what we ’ ve heard about the presidential order , they have the authority to do this themselves . Now the law does require them every quarter to bring their congressional overseers up to date with what they ’ re doing . So they ’ d have to report what they ’ re doing in the grid maybe after the fact , but they ’ d have to report it . The big question that we were trying to answer is did anybody go to the president to tell them that we were conducting this traditional military activity inside the Russian grid ?
What we found was a lot of people saying to us , we don ’ t think the president knows very much about it . He may have been told generally that of course we ’ re doing cyber operations , but there ’ s a great reluctance inside the intelligence community and certainly inside the U.S. military about what they tell the president about operations against Russia . And that ’ s because every time the president hears the words Russia and cyber , his mind immediately goes to the charge that the Russians put him in office or somehow were responsible for his election because of what they did in 2016 , and that sets him off . So we ’ ve seen time and time again that people sort of avoid the topic .
So it ’ s quite possible that the president learned about this operation to get inside the Russian electrical grid from your reporting .
We think that ’ s possible . He issued two tweets the night that it came out , on Saturday night . The first suggested that publishing it was perhaps an act of treason .
Yes . And then in the second tweet he said , and it ’ s all wrong .
David , the treason charge seems worth asking you about . Did the people you talked to inside the U.S. military , Cyber Command , the intelligence community , did they discourage you from reporting on any of this ?
They didn ’ t . They refused to comment on the specifics that we had found about the U.S. operation . But you know , we ’ ve been doing this for a long time , and we ’ re accustomed to going to the government and saying , here are the facts we ’ re going to lay out . And if you have any national security objections to our publishing this , let us know now before we print , and we ’ ll make some judgments about whether to hold back some details . And over the years I have held back details , including about some American cyber operations , when the government made the case that the adversary didn ’ t know about it . But in this case , they came back and said , we have no national security objections .
In fact , it may be that people in the Trump administration , perhaps not the president himself but those around him , may have wanted you to report this .
Or certainly they didn ’ t see a downside to it . There ’ s this great scene at the end of “ Dr . Strangelove ” when they ’ ve been building this huge nuclear gadget and they ’ re keeping it a deep secret , and the whole premise of the end of the movie is if you don ’ t tell them about the gadget , what good is it ? So we have sort of the same problem in cyber .
David , from everything you ’ ve explained , the U.S. goal here is deterrence , and it reluctantly entered a more aggressive phase in its approach to cyber with the goal of preventing our adversaries from attacking us . But at what point does a strategy of deterrence inevitably lead to an arms race , where you have to keep up with your enemies and their approach to cyber , and on and on it goes , until eventually , we ’ re in a deeper phase of cyber conflict ?
Michael , we ’ re deeply into that arms race already . We ’ re building up new weapons . Everybody else is building up new weapons , but there ’ s a lot of discussion these days about whether you should have something akin to a digital Geneva Convention . The real Geneva Conventions protect civilians from being gassed , tortured or starved . In the digital Geneva Convention , you might say there are some systems that are so critical to civilian life that we have to protect them — power grids because they power hospitals and nursing homes . You might say that election systems should be off limits . You might say that emergency communication systems , communications to ambulances or the police or the fire department , are off limits . And these all seem like pretty attractive ideas , and a lot of countries have signed on to them , although not the United States so far . And one reason , I think , is that many in the U.S. , inside the government , believe we have a big advantage and that we don ’ t want to give that advantage up and deprive a future president of the United States of the ability to use one of these weapons that we ’ ve spent billions of dollars developing . They might want to be able to go to a president and say , you know , it would be better to manipulate the results in this election than end up with another Nicolás Maduro , the dictator in Venezuela , or it might be better to be able to go into the central bank of this country and drain a dictator ’ s bank account or keep a terrorist organization from being able to spend any money . So if we ’ re going to be able to do those things , we probably wouldn ’ t want to sign up to an agreement that prohibits them . And that ’ s the big argument we need to have as a country , which is what cyber capability are we willing to give up in order to begin to set some norms of behavior that we ’ re hoping other countries will adhere to as well ?
On Monday afternoon , a spokesman for Russian president Vladimir Putin said that Russia was confident it could repel U.S. attempts to hack into its electrical grid but warned that such attacks could eventually escalate into a cyberwar with the U.S. We ’ ll be right back . Here ’ s what else you need to know today .
On Monday , the Chinese government expressed strong support for Hong Kong ’ s chief executive , Carrie Lam , after days of massive protests against her by hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong residents . But the support from China could ultimately backfire by reinforcing protesters ’ fears that Lam is acting on China ’ s behalf . The protests began after Lam pushed for a law that would allow Hong Kong residents to be prosecuted in China , a plan she has since suspended in response to the protests . And —","michael barbaro

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: A Times investigation reveals that the United States is actively infiltrating Russia’s electric power grid. David Sanger on what that means for the future of cyber warfare. It’s Tuesday, June 18.

david sanger

So what happened in 2008 was the Russians did something pretty brilliant. They dropped a bunch of USB keys — you know, the kind you might get at a convention or maybe that’s given to you at a hotel — in parking lots around American bases in the Middle East. People would pick these things up, bring them into work, and, believe it or not, put them in their computers at work.

michael barbaro

Jeez.

archived recording Somebody got away with the most serious breach of Defense Department computer networks ever.

david sanger

And what happened was those keys essentially put some malware into computers that got the Russians inside something called SIPRNet.

archived recording The drive contained malicious coding that spread through classified files and stole information.

david sanger

The official name is the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network, but the main thing to know is it’s the Pentagon’s secret network.

archived recording We didn’t think that was possible because it’s completely separate from the internet.

david sanger

And suddenly, they were able to drain out of the Pentagon some of its most secret communications, all because somebody picked up a USB and stuck it in their machines. And one day, a woman named Debbie Plunkett came into the office at the N.S.A. Remember, this was just ahead of President Obama’s election. And she discovered this breach, and basically she said, we’ve got to get them out. And this started a massive effort secretly inside the N.S.A. to clean out the Department of Defense’s systems. In fact, after a while, people began using superglue to seal the USB ports on Pentagon computers —

michael barbaro

Wow.

david sanger

— so that no idiot would go pick up a USB from someplace and put it in. It was a low-tech solution, Michael, but it worked.

michael barbaro

So beyond supergluing the USB ports on computers inside the Defense Department, what is the response from the U.S. to this incursion?

david sanger

The response was near-panic. I mean, think about what had happened just in that year or two. The Chinese had gotten inside Lockheed Martin and stolen many of the designs for the F-35, the most expensive fighter jet that you’ve ever paid for. And that’s why the Chinese today are producing what looks like an F-35, although it’s a lot cheaper than ours. The United States was launching its own big, sophisticated cyber operation against Iran’s nuclear enrichment plant at Natanz. And the Russians, of course, were coming inside the Pentagon. And everybody realized, this is now not just a big intelligence problem. This is a big military problem, and we don’t have a military unit of size and sophistication to deal with it. And that was the birth of what is now United States Cyber Command.

michael barbaro

So what does this newly established Cyber Command do about Russia, the culprit of this really damaging attack on the Pentagon?

david sanger

Initially, Michael, not much. U.S. Cyber Command was just getting organized. It didn’t have many troops. It didn’t have much expertise. It was based at Fort Meade, but it was highly dependent on its next-door neighbor, the National Security Agency, for most of its capability to look inside networks, much less attack back. So they spent years sort of watching the Russians and building their forces, building cyber sort of expeditionary teams that they could put out with American Army units and Navy units and the Air Force and others. But the big concern was what do you do in time of warfare when the Russians or the Chinese or some other adversary might do more than just get into your communications networks? They might go in to try to change data, like supposing they altered the targeting on a missile.

Of course while the U.S. was having this debate, there were some real attacks happening.

It’s not that the Russians had used that to go turn off the lights yet. They hadn’t, at least in the United States, but that they were prepared to do so.

michael barbaro

So David, you’ve described a series of cyberattacks against the U.S. by its adversaries that are escalating in their brazenness. So why does it seem that this Cyber Command, which was created specifically to defend the U.S. against these kinds of attacks, isn’t doing very much about it?

david sanger

Well, for a couple of reasons. First, the primary defense for the United States is supposed to come from the Department of Homeland Security. The Pentagon was only supposed to get into this game when the attacks became so severe that they threatened the viability of the United States. The second reason is that Cyber Command didn’t really have the authorities to do much more than defend the Pentagon. That’s what its legal authority was. And there was this great frustration, because everybody inside Cyber Command and the N.S.A. and many others realized that no foreign adversary was paying much of a price for attacking the United States.

michael barbaro

And what did he propose to do about that?

david sanger

Well, he didn’t say this in public, but what he had been proposing for years was a concept really drawn from American Special Forces, which is defend forward. Don’t wait to get attacked. You know, the Special Forces has learned in the war on terror that if you’re going to stop a terror attack in Times Square, you better go hit the living room in Pakistan where it’s being planned. And Nakasone sort of had the same concept, which is the United States has to have what he called persistent presence in foreign computer networks around the world, because if you aren’t already buried inside that network, you were never going to see an attack coming, and you wouldn’t have any way to retaliate.

michael barbaro

In other words, you have to go on the offense to really be on the defense.

david sanger

And you have to live in your adversaries’ networks. You have to be inside their computers before they attack you, not after. And he was confirmed, and that began a real new era for how Cyber Command went on the offense.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. So David, you’ve spent the past few months trying to understand what it means for the Trump administration to go on the offense when it comes to cyber. What exactly have you found?

david sanger

Well, the first thing I found was that the Trump administration and Congress enabled Cyber Command to go on the offense much more aggressively than they had been before. In August of 2018, President Trump signed a long-awaited executive order. It was called National Security Presidential Memorandum 13. Its contents are still classified, but essentially it allows the Cyber Command to go ahead and conduct all kinds of operations inside foreign networks without going back to the president for prior approval. Our computer networks around the country were under such a constant barrage of attacks that Cyber Command needed much more freedom to be able to get inside those foreign networks and begin to combat it and that it couldn’t be going to the White House every time it wanted to do this, just the way the Navy doesn’t go to the White House every time it wants to go run a group of destroyers down through the South China Sea or go do patrolling along the DMZ in South Korea.

michael barbaro

In other words, it’s an acknowledgment that cyber is such an active place that the president could spend his entire day signing off on every decision that needed to be made.

david sanger

That’s right, and Congress authorized Cyber Command to do even more. It basically said these kind of operations in cyberspace are part of traditional military activity, and you’re authorized to go ahead and do them the same way that you would do ordinary patrols.

michael barbaro

And so what does this newly empowered Cyber Command do with this authority?

david sanger

Well, the first thing it did was go after those units in Russia that were responsible for a lot of the election-hacking. They shut down the Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg, which, of course, had designed many of those Facebook ads and other social media ads, for a couple of days right around the midterm elections. They went after the G.R.U., the Russian military intelligence unit that had been responsible for breaking into the D.N.C. and then making public much of that data. They sent text messages to individual Russian officers and hackers saying, we know who you are. We know where you live. We know your phone number, and if you mess with us, you’re going to pay a price. So a lot of that action to counter the election malfeasance was made public. What wasn’t made public was a parallel effort to go inside the Russian power grid, to put some code in places where the Russians would see it as a warning, but put other code in places where the Russians wouldn’t see it, in case the U.S. ever needed to act against Russia’s utilities as the Russians were putting malware in our systems.

michael barbaro

So the U.S. now has the ability to interfere with the Russian power grid in the same way that Russia can already interfere with the U.S. power grid.

david sanger

That’s right. The U.S. wanted to get deep inside the Russian systems, this time not just for surveillance but to be able to place malware there, basically ticking time bombs or what you might think of as digital landmines that they could set off if we got into a broader conflict with the Russians.

michael barbaro

David, how significant is it that the U.S. took this step of basically infiltrating Russia’s electric grid?

david sanger

Oh, I think it’s a big step, Michael, but it’s also a pretty risky one. So classic deterrence theory would tell you, do like in the nuclear age, right? If they can hit you, show them you can hit them back. But I think the Russians have some doubts that we’d really be willing to pull the plug. They know that we’re limited by all kinds of legal and ethical considerations and that unplugging a country, except in the midst of a war, would cause a lot of civilian deaths. The people who are most vulnerable if you unplug the grid are people in hospitals or nursing homes. So there’d be a great reluctance to cause civilian casualties.

michael barbaro

But wouldn’t that presumption be true on both sides?

david sanger

It might be, but one of the remarkable things about cyber is how well you can go hide the causes of a cyberattack. Most cyber is used in short-of-war conflicts, not full-scale war, but instead this quiet war of attrition where countries are trying to seek advantage or gain power by manipulating the data in your financial systems or making A.T.M.s unavailable or turning off the power in certain parts of the city, but maybe not in others. So it’s pretty subtle. And the Russians are really smart. They do not want to trigger a general military conflict between the U.S. and Russia. Most other countries don’t either. So they want to use their cyber capability in the most subtle way possible.

michael barbaro

David, given that, as you just said, the battlefield is much more subtle when it comes to cyber than traditional warfare, but the consequences just as significant, at what point does Cyber Command, do all these officials with these new powers granted by the Trump administration, at what point do they need to seek the approval of the president and of Congress to conduct these operations, like entering the Russian electrical grid, in the way that they would for traditional warfare?

It’s a fascinating question, because if you look at the law, and from what we’ve heard about the presidential order, they have the authority to do this themselves. Now the law does require them every quarter to bring their congressional overseers up to date with what they’re doing. So they’d have to report what they’re doing in the grid maybe after the fact, but they’d have to report it. The big question that we were trying to answer is did anybody go to the president to tell them that we were conducting this traditional military activity inside the Russian grid?

michael barbaro

And what did you find?

What we found was a lot of people saying to us, we don’t think the president knows very much about it. He may have been told generally that of course we’re doing cyber operations, but there’s a great reluctance inside the intelligence community and certainly inside the U.S. military about what they tell the president about operations against Russia. And that’s because every time the president hears the words Russia and cyber, his mind immediately goes to the charge that the Russians put him in office or somehow were responsible for his election because of what they did in 2016, and that sets him off. So we’ve seen time and time again that people sort of avoid the topic.

michael barbaro

So it’s quite possible that the president learned about this operation to get inside the Russian electrical grid from your reporting.

david sanger

We think that’s possible. He issued two tweets the night that it came out, on Saturday night. The first suggested that publishing it was perhaps an act of treason.

michael barbaro

He called you a traitor, basically.

david sanger

Yes. And then in the second tweet he said, and it’s all wrong.

michael barbaro

David, the treason charge seems worth asking you about. Did the people you talked to inside the U.S. military, Cyber Command, the intelligence community, did they discourage you from reporting on any of this?

david sanger

They didn’t. They refused to comment on the specifics that we had found about the U.S. operation. But you know, we’ve been doing this for a long time, and we’re accustomed to going to the government and saying, here are the facts we’re going to lay out. And if you have any national security objections to our publishing this, let us know now before we print, and we’ll make some judgments about whether to hold back some details. And over the years I have held back details, including about some American cyber operations, when the government made the case that the adversary didn’t know about it. But in this case, they came back and said, we have no national security objections.

michael barbaro

In fact, it may be that people in the Trump administration, perhaps not the president himself but those around him, may have wanted you to report this.

david sanger

Or certainly they didn’t see a downside to it. There’s this great scene at the end of “Dr. Strangelove” when they’ve been building this huge nuclear gadget and they’re keeping it a deep secret, and the whole premise of the end of the movie is if you don’t tell them about the gadget, what good is it? So we have sort of the same problem in cyber.

michael barbaro

David, from everything you’ve explained, the U.S. goal here is deterrence, and it reluctantly entered a more aggressive phase in its approach to cyber with the goal of preventing our adversaries from attacking us. But at what point does a strategy of deterrence inevitably lead to an arms race, where you have to keep up with your enemies and their approach to cyber, and on and on it goes, until eventually, we’re in a deeper phase of cyber conflict?

david sanger

Michael, we’re deeply into that arms race already. We’re building up new weapons. Everybody else is building up new weapons, but there’s a lot of discussion these days about whether you should have something akin to a digital Geneva Convention. The real Geneva Conventions protect civilians from being gassed, tortured or starved. In the digital Geneva Convention, you might say there are some systems that are so critical to civilian life that we have to protect them — power grids because they power hospitals and nursing homes. You might say that election systems should be off limits. You might say that emergency communication systems, communications to ambulances or the police or the fire department, are off limits. And these all seem like pretty attractive ideas, and a lot of countries have signed on to them, although not the United States so far. And one reason, I think, is that many in the U.S., inside the government, believe we have a big advantage and that we don’t want to give that advantage up and deprive a future president of the United States of the ability to use one of these weapons that we’ve spent billions of dollars developing. They might want to be able to go to a president and say, you know, it would be better to manipulate the results in this election than end up with another Nicolás Maduro, the dictator in Venezuela, or it might be better to be able to go into the central bank of this country and drain a dictator’s bank account or keep a terrorist organization from being able to spend any money. So if we’re going to be able to do those things, we probably wouldn’t want to sign up to an agreement that prohibits them. And that’s the big argument we need to have as a country, which is what cyber capability are we willing to give up in order to begin to set some norms of behavior that we’re hoping other countries will adhere to as well?

michael barbaro

David, thank you very much. We appreciate it.

david sanger

Thank you, Michael.

michael barbaro

On Monday afternoon, a spokesman for Russian president Vladimir Putin said that Russia was confident it could repel U.S. attempts to hack into its electrical grid but warned that such attacks could eventually escalate into a cyberwar with the U.S. We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.

On Monday, the Chinese government expressed strong support for Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, after days of massive protests against her by hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong residents. But the support from China could ultimately backfire by reinforcing protesters’ fears that Lam is acting on China’s behalf. The protests began after Lam pushed for a law that would allow Hong Kong residents to be prosecuted in China, a plan she has since suspended in response to the protests. And —

Fusion’s two law firms — Cunningham Levy Muse, and Zuckerman Spaeder — are asking a U.S. District Court judge to block access.

The court battle unfolded this way:

Congressional committees are conducting broad probes into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and whether President Trump and his associates colluded with Russian operatives.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, California Republican, signed a subpoena for Fusion’s bank records. He wanted to determine who bankrolled a partisan unproven dossier that has become such a large part of the FBI’s, Congress’ and journalists’ investigations.

The Nunes subpoena forced the law firm Perkins Coie to admit that the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign paid the bills. The money went from Democrats to Perkins Coie to Fusion to British ex-spy Christopher Steele, who then paid Kremlin sources for dirt on Mr. Trump.

Fusion’s attorneys did not hide their disapproval of what they called Mr. Nunes’ “fishing expedition” and “McCarthy-like” tactics.

The attorneys asserted that Fusion enjoys “a First Amendment right to associate freely with clients and contractors on political and other matters and a First Amendment right to engage in those client activities when they further political and commercial speech.”

House attorneys argued Fusion has no such rights.

“It is instead a profit-maximizing hired gun, selling its investigative services to the highest bidder,” they said. “[Fusion‘s] goal — to be highly compensated for its work — is not protected associational interest.”

Four vital takeaways from today’s charges

Earlier today the Grand Jury for the District of Columbia charged twelve Russian intelligence officers with conspiring “to gain unauthorized access (to ‘hack’) into the computers of U.S. persons and entities involved in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, steal documents from those computers, and stage releases of the stolen documents to interfere with the 2016 presidential election.” The operation was sustained and sophisticated, and it targeted “over 300 individuals affiliated with the Clinton Campaign, DCCC, and DNC,” according to the indictment.

Furthermore, the operation was consequential. When, in February, Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s office released its indictment of Russians involved in the effort to impact American debate through social media, there was some justified chuckling at the small scale and amateurishness of that effort. The messages were silly, and the spending was a drop in the ocean compared to the massive, sustained, and coordinated social-media spending of American political parties and their allies.

The hacking scandal was different. The hacking scandal mattered.

There’s no way to know if it moved enough votes in key states to swing the election, but the leaks of hacked emails dominated multiple news cycles, embarrassed key Democrats, and sowed a degree of discord within the Democratic party. Republicans, including Donald Trump, exulted in the revelations and sometimes explicitly called for more. “Russia, if you’re listening,” Trump said publicly on July 27, 2016, “I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.”

In his testimony he said he was upset by the problems uncovered in the report, including texts that several FBI employees sent disparaging Trump.

“We need to correct errors, hold wrongdoers accountable and deter future violations,” Rosenstein said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said Saturday that investigations swirling around President Trump are interfering with improved relations with Moscow, noting he has had little contact with the U.S. president.

“We are hostages to this internal strife in the United States,” Putin said at an economic forum in St. Petersburg. “I hope that it will end some day and the objective need for the development of Russian-American relationships will prevail.”

In wide-ranging remarks to reporters and during the televised conference, Putin also said he would step down from his post in 2024, adhering to the Russian constitution ban on anyone serving two consecutive presidential terms.

That pledge, however, does not necessarily mean Putin will retire. In 2008, he stepped down after two consecutive terms to become prime minister, then returned in 2012 to the presidency. He was re-elected in March to a six-year term through 2024.

At the forum, attended by such world leaders as French President Emmanuel Macron and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the Russian president bemoaned the state of relations with America, criticized U.S. sanctions against Russia and slammed Trump's decision to withdrawal from an international nuclear agreement with Iran.

Noting that an international watchdog agency has confirmed that Tehran was abiding by the agreement over its nuclear program, Putin asked: ""What should it be punished for, then?”

The move by Trump to pull out of the deal has also strained relations between Washington and Europe.

“If international agreements are revised every four years it would offer zero horizon for planning,” Putin said. “It will create the atmosphere of nervousness and lack of trust.”

The Russian president also criticized the imposition of Western sanctions against Russia over its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. In addition, the U.S. has applied sanctions in response to Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections.

Putin bemoaned the ""chaotic"" situation of economic punishment and said the ""sanctions baton"" is being used more often in the world, and not just toward Moscow.

""The situation in the world is such that it is as though everyone is playing football, but at the same time, they are applying judo rules to it [the match],"" he said. ""So, we end up with this interesting game, it's neither football, nor judo. It's just chaos.""

The ever-confident Russian leader also took an opportunity to chide Macron over Europe's rift with Trump regarding Iran.

A smiling Putin said in the exchange with the French president that Russia could help protect Europe if its dispute with the U.S. widens.

“Don’t you worry, we will help ensure your security,” Putin promised.

Macron responded on a serious note that France and its allies could stand for themselves.

Trump Jr, a senior executive at the Trump Organization, played down his awareness of the project during his September 2017 interview, saying he knew “very little” about the deal. “I was peripherally aware of it, but most of my knowledge has been gained since as it relates to hearing about it over the last few weeks,” he said.

The Republican-led House intelligence committee, which has come under sharp criticism from Democrats for what they call a deliberately lacklustre Russia inquiry, has released only a handful of interview transcripts despite having published its findings in April.

Thousands of pages of testimony from Trump allies including Trump Jr, Steve Bannon, Jared Kushner, Hope Hicks and Roger Stone are due to be published over the coming months. None has been accused of wrongdoing.

Mueller did not indicate in Thursday’s court filings whether Cohen had been directed to give his misleading testimony to Congress. Any finding that he was urged to lie to protect Trump or his company could expose others in Trump’s circle to fresh legal problems.

Neal Katyal, a supreme court attorney and former acting US solicitor general, said the “next question” for authorities after the discovery that Trump aides lied to Congress and other investigators would be: “Why? At whose direction? Who stood to gain from the lies? What did they know and when?”

The possible implications of Cohen’s guilty plea were also highlighted on Thursday by Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, the Republican chairman of the Senate intelligence committee. “Michael Cohen’s indictment and guilty plea is once again an example that you cannot lie to Congress without consequences,” said Burr.",www.theguardian.com,left,YTMKI2BvT13azA1p

WASHINGTON — President Trump placed a congratulatory call to Vladimir Putin Tuesday, seeking to set up a meeting between the two leaders after Putin's election to another six-year term as president of Russia.

""We will probably get together in the not-too-distant future so we can discuss arms — we can discuss the arms race,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office Tuesday as he met with Saudi Arabia's crown prince.

Putin offered an olive branch to the West on Monday after his overwhelming re-election victory, saying he wanted to resolve differences with other countries and end the arms race.

Trump said Tuesday that Putin repeated that desire in their phone call. The arms race, Trump said, is ""getting out of control, but we will never allow anybody to have anything close to what we have.""

Apparently not discussed: Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign and the poisoning of former Russian spies in the United Kingdom with a Russian-made nerve agent. ""I don’t believe it came up on this specific call,"" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said.

Russian accounts say the call was placed ""on the initiative of the American side"" and ""focused on overcoming the problems that have accumulated in Russian-U.S. relations.""

Such post-election phone calls are a routine part of diplomacy. President Obama called the Kremlin after Putin's election in 2012, touting the success of a ""reset"" in relations under former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev.

But lingering controversies over the legitimacy of the Putin's election — and Putin's role in trying to undermine U.S. elections in 2016 — led to swift denunciations of the call.

“An American president does not lead the free world by congratulating dictators on winning sham elections,"" Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said in a statement.

Putin won re-election with 76.6% of the vote. There were widespread reports of ballot-box stuffing and the most prominent opposition leader was banned from the ballot.

Sanders declined to pass judgment on those elections Monday. ""We don’t get to dictate how other countries operate,"" she said. ""We can only focus on the freeness and the fairness of our elections.""

The Russian state news service said the two sides also discussed lower-level relations after Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who had a personal relationship with Putin. The Kremlin described the call as ""constructive and businesslike.""

No, Mr. Durham. We Need Your Report Before Election Day

Commentary

Fox’s Brooke Singman, who has been perspicacious in her coverage of the probe of the Russia probe, had a disturbing “exclusive” on July 9, with the headline: “Durham, under pressure to wrap up investigation, could ‘punt’ to after Election Day: source”

Wouldn’t we love to know who her “source” or “sources” were? But never mind for the moment. The story begins:

“U.S. Attorney John Durham is under pressure to wrap up his investigation into the origins of the Russia probe by the end of the summer, but if he doesn’t, he could wait to reveal his findings or initiate prosecutions until after the 2020 presidential election, Fox News has learned.

“Two sources familiar with Durham’s investigation told Fox News this week that Durham is working expeditiously to try to finish the probe by the end of summer, but that several lines of investigation are not yet complete.

“‘He believes it’s critical to do them,’ one source said. ‘He is feeling more pressure to get this done and wrapped up.’

“The source also told Fox News that Durham “does not want this to be viewed political,” and the closer it gets to November, Durham could “punt it to after the election.”

Durham doesn’t want his report “to be viewed political”? He must be dreaming. Nothing could be more political. It’s inextricably so, no matter what he says or does or when he does it.

To wit, what Durham is said to be investigating is whether one or more of our most important law enforcement and intelligence agencies (Justice Department, FBI, CIA, State Department, and so forth) were hijacked and used illegally to prevent Donald Trump from being elected president and/or for undercutting his presidency and administration after he was.

What in the Sam Hill could be more political than that?

Yes, it would be a crime as well, but a crime for the most obvious and extreme political ends.

And if Durham does “punt” until after the 2020 election, it could become more political still, pushing our society to the edge of civil war and beyond.

Imagine this: Joe Biden wins the election and come January 2021, just before his inauguration, the Durham report comes out. Several major players in the aforementioned government agencies, household names at this point, are indicted.

These indictments go all the way to the top but not quite, leaving Obama and Biden unscathed, at least technically. (I am taking William Barr at his word that the former president and vice president aren’t being investigated, although it will more than likely be clear that they aren’t, shall we say, in the clear.)

How does Durham, or any reasonable person, expect the losers in the election, the tens of millions of Trump supporters, to react then?

With massive justifiable outrage is my guess.

They will do any number of things, from refusing to pay taxes, to acts of sabotage, to taking to the streets in a more militarily organized fashion than anything we are seeing today.

And, for that matter, how could Biden possibly govern with criminal indictments of his and Obama’s previous administration all around him? Whatever moral authority he had would be gone.

In all, the country would start to disintegrate. You name the way.

No, Durham had better think twice about “punting” his report until after the election.

Of course, that’s assuming Singman’s “sources” are reliable. We have seen many instances where journalists’ sources haven’t been. The anonymous source is the rotten underbelly of journalism, frequently used for nefarious ends and often is the cause of rewards, such as a Pulitzer Prize, that seem ludicrous months or even weeks later.

I’m hoping this is the case here, but I wonder.

Whatever is true, Mr. Durham, please finish quickly, before the election. You owe it to the American public.

Special counsel Robert Mueller’s historic decision to end his Russia probe on Friday without filing election conspiracy charges against any Trump associate is vindication for Devin Nunes.

A year ago, Mr. Nunes, a Republican congressman from California farm country cleared President Trump and his advisers in a report by the majority of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.

Mr. Nunes said the verdict was simple. The committee took testimony from intelligence and law enforcement officials, including Democratic Party loyalists. No one presented evidence that the president’s campaign conspired with Moscow to hack Democratic Party computers or coordinate Russian social media attacks on Hillary Clinton.

On Fox News’ “Ingraham Angle” Friday night, Mr. Nunes said the real scandal is the secret effort by Barack Obama-Clinton operatives to doom Mr. Trump.

“I think what you’re seeing tonight, Laura, is the unraveling of the biggest scandal in American history,” Mr. Nunes said. “People need to remember this actually likely dates back to late 2015, early 2016. [A] Clinton, Obama operation with a bunch of dirty cops at the FBI and career Justice Department officials who are all part of it.”

Before his committee’s February 2018 final report, Mr. Nunes had run up against a concerted liberal campaign to delegitimize his chairmanship.

Mr. Nunes broke off the Russia probe to create a new inquiry: FBI abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). In the process, he forced Democrats to disclose one of the biggest secrets in election 2016: who funded the Christopher Steele dossier that accused Mr. Trump and associates of various felonies. The answer: the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign.

Conservatives say the Mueller decision now places the dossier in the debunked basket.

The Nunes side probe angered liberals. Andrea Mitchell, an MSNBC news anchor, called him a “clown.” John Heilemann, an MSNBC analyst, said he was an agent of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

A New York Times magazine article said in April 2018 that Mr. Nunes “displayed a deep mistrust of the expert consensus on reality.” Other liberal magazines have also attacked him and his family.

Rep. Adam Schiff, California Democrat, who now heads the committee, accused Mr. Nunes of protecting the president.

Mr. Schiff has re-started the Russian probe and has hired a chief investigator, who, like him, believes in Mr. Steele and the dossier.

Among Mr. Nunes FISA probe findings:

Democrats funded the Steele dossier as an unverified opposite research paper and spread it around Washington.

The FBI cited the dossier as evidence to obtain a judge’s surveillance warrant on campaign adviser Carter Page. The application didn’t disclose that it was a Democrat Party indictment of Mr. Trump.

The FBI presented a Yahoo News story as corroboration. It actually came from dossier creator Steele.

The FBI fired Mr. Steele for leaking to the press, then continued to use his information via then-associate deputy attorney general Bruce Ohr. Mr. Ohr told the FBI Mr. Steele was “desperate” to sink Mr. Trump.

Lead FBI agent Peter Strzok and his lover, FBI counsel Lisa Page, exchanged harsh text messages about Mr. Trump and vowed to “stop” him.
