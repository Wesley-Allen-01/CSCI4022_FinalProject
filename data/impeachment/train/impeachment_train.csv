A bitter defeat

Throughout the entire impeachment inquiry process, Trump has constantly assailed and insulted the lawmakers leading the probe, the reporters covering it, and the government employees testifying in it. Trump has insisted that a July 25 phone call he had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in which he asked for the investigations as ""a favor,"" was ""perfect,"" and that the entire impeachment effort is part of a personal vendetta against him and a desire by Democrats to overthrow his 2016 election.

On Tuesday, Trump wrote a furious letter to Pelosi, calling his impeachment ""an illegal, partisan attempted coup."" ""You are the ones interfering in America's elections,"" Trump wrote in the six-page screed. ""You are the ones subverting America's Democracy. You are the ones Obstructing Justice. You are the ones bringing pain and suffering to our Republic for your own selfish personal, political, and partisan gain,"" Trump wrote. But it is partly because Trump was so furious, and was so personally undone by the impeachment, that Wednesday's vote marked such a bitter defeat. For a president obsessed with winning, the prospect of being forever part of the group of three U.S. presidents in the country's history who have been impeached likely represents a singular professional and personal humiliation.

Trump defiant

As the Democratic-majority House voted on Wednesday to deal Trump the sharpest blow of his political life, the president was a thousand miles away — literally. He spent Wednesday evening in the swing state of Michigan, where he held a raucous campaign rally in Battle Creek before a crowd of 10,000 adoring supporters.

Williamson, Katherine Timpf, Zachary Evans, David Harsanyi, Jim Geraghty, Jonah Goldberg","The House of Representatives voted largely along party lines Wednesday evening to impeach Donald Trump , making him just the third president in U.S. history to stand trial for high crimes and misdemeanors in the Senate .
The vote was split to address both articles , with the House voting to impeach on “ abuse of power ” by a 230-197 margin , and passing “ obstruction of Congress ” by a 229-198 margin . One lawmaker , Tulsi Gabbard ( D. , Hawaii ) , voted “ present ” on both articles .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , speaking just after the vote , called impeachment “ a great day for the Constitution ” but “ a sad day for America . ”
“ I could not be prouder or more inspired by the moral courage of the House Democrats , ” she said . “ We never asked one of them how they were going to vote . We never whipped this vote . ”
The House Speaker was vague when asked about her timeline for sending the articles to the Senate , after news broke Wednesday that Democrats wanted to gain leverage over a Senate trial by withholding the articles . “ We ’ re not sending it tonight , ” Pelosi said . “ . . . It ’ s up to the Senate to say what their rules will be . ”

The House of Representatives voted largely along party lines Wednesday evening to impeach Donald Trump, making him just the third president in U.S. history to stand trial for high crimes and misdemeanors in the Senate.

The vote was split to address both articles, with the House voting to impeach on “abuse of power” by a 230-197 margin, and passing “obstruction of Congress” by a 229-198 margin. One lawmaker, Tulsi Gabbard (D., Hawaii), voted “present” on both articles.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, speaking just after the vote, called impeachment “a great day for the Constitution” but “a sad day for America.”

“I could not be prouder or more inspired by the moral courage of the House Democrats,” she said. “We never asked one of them how they were going to vote. We never whipped this vote.”

The House Speaker was vague when asked about her timeline for sending the articles to the Senate, after news broke Wednesday that Democrats wanted to gain leverage over a Senate trial by withholding the articles. “We’re not sending it tonight,” Pelosi said. “. . . It’s up to the Senate to say what their rules will be.”

Every GOP member voted against both articles, while Michigan Independent Justin Amash, who left the Republican party earlier this year after saying in May that the Mueller Report showed Trump’s “impeachable conduct,” voted yes on both articles.

Among Democrats, Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey — who is expected to become a Republican — and Collin Peterson of Minnesota voted against both articles after opposing the opening of the impeachment inquiry in October.

HOUSE DEMS RAISE PROSPECT OF NEW IMPEACHMENT ARTICLES IN COURT BATTLE OVER MCGAHN TESTIMONY
Meanwhile , the president delivered celebratory remarks with supporters on Thursday as his White House declared vindication , maintaining as he did throughout the impeachment inquiry and trial , that he `` did nothing wrong . ''
But one matter could result in new developments as early as Friday , with the D.C . Circuit Court of Appeals expected to issue a ruling in the near future regarding whether the House Judiciary Committee can compel the testimony of former White House Counsel Don McGahn .
In a court filing for that case , House Democrats revealed that McGahn 's testimony related to information in the Special Counsel 's Russia report could even be used for new articles of impeachment .
`` If McGahn ’ s testimony produces new evidence supporting the conclusion that President Trump committed impeachable offenses that are not covered by the Articles approved by the House , the Committee will proceed accordingly -- -including , if necessary , by considering whether to recommend new articles of impeachment , ” the committee 's December brief stated , noting that they still have “ ongoing impeachment investigations . ”
According to former special counsel Robert Mueller 's report , Trump had instructed McGahn to relay orders to have Mueller fired , which Trump 's critics have said is enough to justify an obstruction of justice charge , although this was not included in the articles of impeachment that were the subject of Trump 's recent trial .
The D.C . Circuit 's ruling in that case could influence how House Democrats proceed with other avenues of investigation . Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler , D-N.Y. , warned Wednesday that he may issue a subpoena for former national security adviser John Bolton in order to further delve into Trump 's dealings with Ukraine .
TRUMP PROUDLY DISPLAYS 'ACQUITTED ' HEADLINES , MERE FEET FROM PELOSI AT PRAYER BREAKFAST
Rep. Madeline Dean , D-Pa. , said Thursday that she spoke to Nadler and that she believes that Democrats `` will be doing continuing oversight , including having Mr . Bolton . ''
When asked about this , House Oversight Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney , D-N.Y. , simply said , `` Well , that 's a topic we can discuss later , '' although days prior to Trump 's acquittal she told Bloomberg , “ The investigations and oversight will continue , ” and made reference to `` several cases . ''
Bolton had said he would comply with a Senate subpoena if he received one during Trump 's impeachment trial , but House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff , D-Calif. , told MSNBC 's Rachel Maddow Wednesday that after the Senate voted not to call witnesses , Bolton refused to submit a sworn affidavit .
The legal battles may not all be waged from the same side of the aisle , however , as Republicans are looking to punch back .
Days before Trump 's acquittal , Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham , R-S.C. , told Fox News ' `` Sunday Morning Futures '' that in the coming weeks , Republicans would be investigating the anonymous whistleblower , whose complaint about Trump 's phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky led to the impeachment inquiry . Graham also said he wanted to look into Hunter Biden 's dealings with Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings , and any potential conflict of interest with former Vice President Joe Biden .
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley , R-Iowa , and Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Ron Johnson , R-Wis. , announced in a letter Wednesday they are seeking `` records of Hunter Biden ’ s travel while he was under U.S. Secret Service protection as they continue to investigate potential conflicts of interest to boost his business ventures in Ukraine and China . ''
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has also been in the GOP 's crosshairs . House Republicans introduced a resolution Wednesday against Pelosi after she tore up a copy of the State of the Union address Tuesday night .

But one matter could result in new developments as early as Friday, with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals expected to issue a ruling in the near future regarding whether the House Judiciary Committee can compel the testimony of former White House Counsel Don McGahn.

In a court filing for that case, House Democrats revealed that McGahn's testimony related to information in the Special Counsel's Russia report could even be used for new articles of impeachment.

""If McGahn’s testimony produces new evidence supporting the conclusion that President Trump committed impeachable offenses that are not covered by the Articles approved by the House, the Committee will proceed accordingly---including, if necessary, by considering whether to recommend new articles of impeachment,” the committee's December brief stated, noting that they still have “ongoing impeachment investigations.”

According to former special counsel Robert Mueller's report, Trump had instructed McGahn to relay orders to have Mueller fired, which Trump's critics have said is enough to justify an obstruction of justice charge, although this was not included in the articles of impeachment that were the subject of Trump's recent trial.

The D.C. Circuit's ruling in that case could influence how House Democrats proceed with other avenues of investigation. Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., warned Wednesday that he may issue a subpoena for former national security adviser John Bolton in order to further delve into Trump's dealings with Ukraine.

TRUMP PROUDLY DISPLAYS 'ACQUITTED' HEADLINES, MERE FEET FROM PELOSI AT PRAYER BREAKFAST

Rep. Madeline Dean, D-Pa., said Thursday that she spoke to Nadler and that she believes that Democrats ""will be doing continuing oversight, including having Mr. Bolton.""

When asked about this, House Oversight Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., simply said, ""Well, that's a topic we can discuss later,"" although days prior to Trump's acquittal she told Bloomberg, “The investigations and oversight will continue,” and made reference to ""several cases.""

Bolton had said he would comply with a Senate subpoena if he received one during Trump's impeachment trial, but House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Wednesday that after the Senate voted not to call witnesses, Bolton refused to submit a sworn affidavit.

Bolton has not commented on Schiff's claim.

The legal battles may not all be waged from the same side of the aisle, however, as Republicans are looking to punch back.

Days before Trump's acquittal, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures"" that in the coming weeks, Republicans would be investigating the anonymous whistleblower, whose complaint about Trump's phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky led to the impeachment inquiry. Graham also said he wanted to look into Hunter Biden's dealings with Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings, and any potential conflict of interest with former Vice President Joe Biden.

Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., announced in a letter Wednesday they are seeking ""records of Hunter Biden’s travel while he was under U.S. Secret Service protection as they continue to investigate potential conflicts of interest to boost his business ventures in Ukraine and China.""

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has also been in the GOP's crosshairs. House Republicans introduced a resolution Wednesday against Pelosi after she tore up a copy of the State of the Union address Tuesday night.

The privileged resolution, introduced by Rep. Kay Granger, R-Texas, slammed Pelosi's behavior as “a breach of decorum and degraded the proceedings of the joint session, to the discredit of the House."" The House on Thursday voted to table the measure.

The letter , which may be sent as early as Friday , apparently dares Pelosi to put the question of a formal impeachment inquiry before the House of Representatives for a vote .
On Sept. 24 , Pelosi announced that House Democrats would undertake the probe without asking for the support of the members of the House .

However , Pelosi decision carries other serious implications , as explained by Judge Napolitano , host of Fox Nation ’ s “ Liberty File with Judge Napolitano . ”
The White House letter will argue that the White House is not required to comply with the Democrats ' investigation because Pelosi has n't codified the probe with a formal vote on the House floor .
The Judge ’ s remarks were recorded before Fox News confirmed that the White House planned to send this letter , but his legal analysis finds that the White House ’ s argument has merit .
He explained that Speaker Pelosi is not required to put the question of an impeachment inquiry up for a vote , but if she did , and if it was approved by a majority of House members , then her inquiry would be strengthened .
“ Mrs . Pelosi is correct that the Constitution does not require a full House vote , before the House begins an impeachment inquiry , but when it does so… without the full House vote it does so based on federal law… that authority comes from statues , not the Constitution . That ’ s very significant . When an authority comes from a statute there are other statues that can contradict it , ” the judge said .

He said the White House has the legal right to fight the Democrats ’ effort to compel their cooperation .
“ For example , if the House Intelligence Committee calls Rudy Giuliani to testify before it , I would expect that Giuliani would assert the attorney-client privilege , which is a court rule that comes from a statue… So Giuliani would say ‘ Look I don ’ t have to answer any questions and I don ’ t have to show you any documents , ’ and they would be at a standstill . And if the committee went to court , I think that Giuliani ’ s invocation of the attorney-client privilege would prevail , ” he said .
However , if Pelosi put the question of an impeachment inquiry up for a vote and a majority of House members approve it – that changes the game .

With the revelation reported Sunday that Trump 's former national security adviser , John Bolton , wrote in a forthcoming book that Trump told him security assistance to Ukraine was conditioned on investigations he wanted , lawmakers have engaged in a new wave of the debate over whether to call witnesses before the Senate .
Democrats have pushed for Bolton and Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney to be subpoenaed , a point their questions focused on during Wednesday 's session , while Trump 's legal team warned having witnesses could take a long time . Witnesses Republicans might want to call include the Bidens and the anonymous whistleblower , who Democrats say are irrelevant .

The lawyers said they would call “ a long list of witnesses ” if they are allowed , which could prevent the chamber from its regular business “ for months . ”

“ There would be a long list of witnesses , ” Philbin said in response to the question from Sen . Rob Portman , R-Ohio . “ If the body were to go in that direction , it would mean that this would drag on for months and prevent this chamber from getting its business done . ''
But the Democratic House managers contended that it was the Senate 's duty to seek out new evidence , especially considering Bolton 's stated willingness to testify .

Republican question for Trump team: Given that impeachment proceedings are privileged in the Senate and largely prevent other work from taking place while they are ongoing, please address the obligations of allowing the House to present an incomplete case to the Senate and request the Senate to seek testimony from additional witnesses.

With the revelation reported Sunday that Trump's former national security adviser, John Bolton, wrote in a forthcoming book that Trump told him security assistance to Ukraine was conditioned on investigations he wanted, lawmakers have engaged in a new wave of the debate over whether to call witnesses before the Senate.

Democrats have pushed for Bolton and Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney to be subpoenaed, a point their questions focused on during Wednesday's session, while Trump's legal team warned having witnesses could take a long time. Witnesses Republicans might want to call include the Bidens and the anonymous whistleblower, who Democrats say are irrelevant.

The lawyers said they would call “a long list of witnesses” if they are allowed, which could prevent the chamber from its regular business “for months.”

Philbin criticized the case from House Democrats as “half-baked” and said the prosecutors are asking the Senate to conduct part of their investigation by calling more witnesses.

“There would be a long list of witnesses,” Philbin said in response to the question from Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio. “If the body were to go in that direction, it would mean that this would drag on for months and prevent this chamber from getting its business done.""

But the Democratic House managers contended that it was the Senate's duty to seek out new evidence, especially considering Bolton's stated willingness to testify.

""When you have a witness as plainly relevant as John Bolton,"" Schiff said, ""who has volunteered to come and testify, to run him away, to look the other way I think is deeply at odds of being an impartial juror.""

Disagreement over the facts of the case

Democratic question for House managers : The president's counsel stated that 'there is simply no evidence anywhere that President Trump ever linked security assistance to any investigations.’ Is that true?

: The president's counsel stated that 'there is simply no evidence anywhere that President Trump ever linked security assistance to any investigations.’ Is that true? Democratic question for House managers : Is the White House correct in its trial memorandum and in presentations of its case that ""President Zelensky and other senior Ukrainian officials did not even know that the security assistance had been paused"" before seeing press reports on Aug. 28, 2019, which was more than a month after the July 25 phone call between Presidents Zelensky and Trump?

Republican question for Trump team : What did Hunter Biden do for the money that Burisma Holdings paid him?

: What did Hunter Biden do for the money that Burisma Holdings paid him? Republican question for Trump team: We’ve seen house managers repeatedly play video clips of acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney's press conference in which they claim he said there was a quid pro quo. How do you respond to the House managers' allegation that Mr. Mulvaney supported their claims in his press conference?

Part of the day Wednesday was spent repeating both sides' claims from their opening arguments over the last several days. At odds between the two teams, among other points: Whether Ukrainians knew that aid was being withheld before a late August article alerting them to the fact; whether there is evidence that Trump directly tied the money to investigations; and whether Hunter Biden's role on the board of a Ukrainian company is relevant to impeachment.

Philbin said the House prosecutors hadn’t made their case and hadn’t cited laws the president broke.

House Manager Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., said there was “overwhelming evidence” aid was withheld to pressure Ukraine to open investigations. Democrats presented a slide labeled “Bogus Explanation: There Is No Direct Evidence” as Crow walked senators through some of the evidence of the aid’s linkage to investigations.

Among several other pieces of evidence, Crow cited a press conference during which Mulvaney initially said Trump had linked aid and investigations into corruption and a DNC server. Mulvaney later walked back the comments.

White House counsel Michael Purpura read a statement from Mulvaney in which he blamed the press for mischaracterizing his words during the press conference and amounted it to a ""witch hunt"" against the president.

Both articles — the first charging Trump with abuse of power , and the second charging him with obstruction of Congress — were approved by the committee on party-line votes , with all 23 Democrats voting in favor and all 17 Republicans voting against ( Rep. Ted Lieu ( D-CA ) missed the vote because he was recovering from a heart procedure ) .
That outcome was no surprise , since the Judiciary Committee is generally filled with staunch liberals and conservatives , and since opinion on Trump ’ s impeachment and the Ukraine scandal has fallen along partisan lines in the House .
The committee ’ s vote came after a lengthy , three-part hearing — opening statements Wednesday night , a marathon all-day debate on amendments to the articles Thursday , and a final vote Friday . Watch it here :
Throughout the hearing , Democrats spoke of their concern over President Trump ’ s alleged abuse of power in the Ukraine scandal , and Republicans either complained about process , questioned the evidence , or outright argued that what Trump did wasn ’ t so bad after all .
The hearing , billed as a “ markup ” of the articles of impeachment , wasn ’ t really about deliberation — no serious amendments were proposed or discussed , and Republicans ’ main goal was to attempt to slow things down with dilatory tactics .

Article I , “ Abuse of Power , ” focuses on the underlying facts of the Ukraine scandal . It asserts that Trump :
“ Corruptly solicited the Government of Ukraine to publicly announce investigations ” into his political rival Joe Biden , and into “ a discredited theory ” that Ukraine interfered with the 2016 election .
Attempted to condition two “ official acts ” on this announcement — a White House meeting with Ukraine ’ s president , and the release of $ 391 million of blocked military aid for Ukraine .
All this , Article I continues , is abusing the powers of the presidency “ by ignoring and injuring national security and other vital national interests to obtain an improper personal political benefit. ” The article also asserts that Trump “ betrayed the Nation by abusing his high office to enlist a foreign power in corrupting democratic elections . ”
Article II , “ Obstruction of Congress , ” states that President Trump “ has directed the unprecedented , categorical , and indiscriminate defiance of subpoenas issued by the House of Representatives pursuant to its ‘ sole Power of Impeachment . ’ ”

Directed current and former executive branch officials to refuse subpoenas for their testimony

Therefore , both articles conclude , Trump should be removed from office and barred from holding any future office . And now , both have been approved by the House Judiciary Committee .
In introducing just these two articles , Democrats made a decision to focus narrowly on the facts surrounding the Ukraine scandal , instead of broadening their impeachment push to include other topics , such as the Mueller report .

What the articles of impeachment say

Article I, “Abuse of Power,” focuses on the underlying facts of the Ukraine scandal. It asserts that Trump:

“Corruptly solicited the Government of Ukraine to publicly announce investigations” into his political rival Joe Biden, and into “a discredited theory” that Ukraine interfered with the 2016 election.

Attempted to condition two “official acts” on this announcement — a White House meeting with Ukraine’s president, and the release of $391 million of blocked military aid for Ukraine.

All this, Article I continues, is abusing the powers of the presidency “by ignoring and injuring national security and other vital national interests to obtain an improper personal political benefit.” The article also asserts that Trump “betrayed the Nation by abusing his high office to enlist a foreign power in corrupting democratic elections.”

Article II, “Obstruction of Congress,” states that President Trump “has directed the unprecedented, categorical, and indiscriminate defiance of subpoenas issued by the House of Representatives pursuant to its ‘sole Power of Impeachment.’”

Specifically, the article goes on, Trump:

Directed the White House to defy a subpoena for documents

Directed other executive branch agencies, such as the State Department and Defense Department, to defy subpoenas

Directed current and former executive branch officials to refuse subpoenas for their testimony

“This abuse of office served to cover up the President’s own repeated misconduct and to seize and control the power of impeachment,” Article II reads. Therefore, both articles conclude, Trump should be removed from office and barred from holding any future office. And now, both have been approved by the House Judiciary Committee.

In introducing just these two articles, Democrats made a decision to focus narrowly on the facts surrounding the Ukraine scandal, instead of broadening their impeachment push to include other topics, such as the Mueller report.

What comes next: a numbers game on the House floor

In theory, members of the House of Representatives will each be solemnly reviewing the evidence for the allegations in each article, and then making up their minds to decide whether to exercise their constitutional powers of impeachment.

But in reality, next week’s votes will come down to raw politics.

There are currently 431 sitting members of the House of Representatives (due to four vacancies). So, if all of those members are present, the magic number for impeaching Trump (or passing anything through the House) would be 216.

Democrats have 233 members, and Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan (who left the Republican Party earlier this year and is now an independent) is expected to vote in favor of impeachment. Republicans, meanwhile, are expected to remain united against impeachment.

That math means 19 Democratic defections will kill impeachment.

Another important point is that the House of Representatives map is skewed toward the GOP — even though Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by 2 percentage points, Trump won more congressional districts. And currently, the Democratic majority includes 31 Democrats representing districts Trump won. Most of them are first-term members, elected for the first time in the 2018 midterms.

So if 19 Democratic defections will kill impeachment, that means that Speaker Nancy Pelosi can “afford” 18 defections from these Trump-district Democrats — but at least 13 of them would have to vote for impeachment, for it to pass.

The White House acknowledged the conference call in a Friday readout that said participants included Minority Leader McCarthy, Whip Steve Scalise, Republican Conference Chair Liz Cheney, and GOP leaders on key House committees — and that they discussed Friday's jobs report, the economy and concerns about Democrats' impeachment inquiry.

The readout makes no mention of Rick Perry.

WASHINGTON ( AP ) — On Day One of extraordinary public impeachment hearings , the top American diplomat in Ukraine revealed new evidence that President Donald Trump was overheard asking about political “ investigations ” that he later demanded from Ukraine in exchange for military aid .
The revelation came as House Democrats pressed their case for Trump ’ s impeachment before the American people after weeks of closed-door interviews .
Wednesday ’ s account from a pair of career diplomats was a striking though complicated one that Democrats say reveals a president abusing his office , and the power of American foreign policy , for personal political gain .

Trump said he was too busy to watch Wednesday and denied having the phone call . “ First I ’ ve heard of it , ” he said when asked .
All day , the diplomats testified about how an ambassador was fired , the new Ukraine government was confused and they discovered an “ irregular channel ” — a shadow U.S. foreign policy orchestrated by the president ’ s personal lawyer , Rudy Giuliani , that raised alarms in diplomatic and national security circles .
The hearing , playing out on live television and in the partisan silos of social media , provided the nation and the world a close-up look at the investigation .
At its core , the inquiry stems from Trump ’ s July 25 phone call when he asked Ukraine ’ s newly elected president , Volodymyr Zelenskiy , for “ a favor . ”
Trump wanted the Ukraine government to investigate Democrats ’ activities in the 2016 election and his potential 2020 rival , Joe Biden -- all while the administration was withholding military aid for the Eastern European ally that is confronting an aggressive neighbor , Russia .

WASHINGTON (AP) — On Day One of extraordinary public impeachment hearings, the top American diplomat in Ukraine revealed new evidence that President Donald Trump was overheard asking about political “investigations” that he later demanded from Ukraine in exchange for military aid.

The revelation came as House Democrats pressed their case for Trump’s impeachment before the American people after weeks of closed-door interviews.

Wednesday’s account from a pair of career diplomats was a striking though complicated one that Democrats say reveals a president abusing his office, and the power of American foreign policy, for personal political gain.

“The matter is as simple and as terrible as that,” said Rep. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the Intelligence Committee, as he opened the daylong hearing. “Our answer to these questions will affect not only the future of this presidency but the future of the presidency itself.”

Career diplomat William Taylor, the charge d’affaires in Kyiv, offered new testimony that Trump was overheard asking on the phone about “the investigations” of Democrats that he wanted Ukraine to pursue that are central to the impeachment inquiry.

Trump said he was too busy to watch Wednesday and denied having the phone call. “First I’ve heard of it,” he said when asked.

All day, the diplomats testified about how an ambassador was fired, the new Ukraine government was confused and they discovered an “irregular channel” — a shadow U.S. foreign policy orchestrated by the president’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, that raised alarms in diplomatic and national security circles.

At its core, the inquiry stems from Trump’s July 25 phone call when he asked Ukraine’s newly elected president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, for “a favor.”

Trump wanted the Ukraine government to investigate Democrats’ activities in the 2016 election and his potential 2020 rival, Joe Biden -- all while the administration was withholding military aid for the Eastern European ally that is confronting an aggressive neighbor, Russia.

Both sides tried to distill it into soundbites.

Democrats said Trump was engaged in “bribery” and “extortion.” Republicans said nothing really happened — the military aid was ultimately released after Congress complained.

Trump restated his aggressive defense with rapid-fire tweets, a video from the Rose Garden and a dismissive retort from the Oval Office as he met with another foreign leader.

What’s happening

Wednesday’s vote to impeach President Trump marked the end of a painstaking, and at times grinding, investigative process that took place over the course of three months in the House of Representatives. Impeachment now moves to a trial in the Senate, where there are indications things may move at a much more accelerated pace.

The ultimate outcome of the trial is almost certain. Even the most optimistic liberal forecasters find the likelihood that 20 Republicans — the number needed to join Democrats in a vote to convict and remove the president — will break party ranks to be close to unimaginable. Trump is widely expected to survive the trial and remain in office.

The path to that expected conclusion is much less clear. The Constitution provides no formal outline for how the Senate trial should be carried out. There are some existing rules from previous impeachments, but any of those could be changed by a simple majority vote.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he wants an expedited trial, and on Tuesday he appeared to reject Democrats’ request for additional witnesses who weren’t interviewed in the House investigation. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham predicted impeachment would “die quickly” in the Senate.

Why there’s debate

With the outcome essentially determined, the substance of the trial takes on extra weight, as both parties hope to influence voters’ decisions in the 2020 election.

There are currently 53 Republicans in the Senate, meaning McConnell can execute his plan for a speedy trial as long as the caucus stays united. Unless a handful of GOP senators break ranks, the Senate trial could be over in a flash with limited testimony and no new witnesses heard. “We ought to vote and move on,"" McConnell said.

The GOP has been remarkably cohesive during the Trump presidency, but a few senators might see political risk in appearing to rush through impeachment and may vote for rules that could make the trial last longer. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who will preside over the trial, could also try to produce a more substantial trial, although his powers are limited. Another force that could extend proceedings is President Trump himself, who reportedly prefers a longer “spectacle” of a trial.

What’s next

After Wednesday’s vote, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she would hold off on sending the impeachment articles to the Senate until she was confident there would be a fair hearing. She didn’t provide details on what she would consider fair or how long she might be willing to delay the exchange, but she could theoretically do so indefinitely.

After a day of tense debate and fiery recriminations , the House voted largely along partisan lines , reshuffling American politics at time when voters are profoundly divided over the nation ’ s leadership and direction .
The Democratic-led House approved both articles of impeachment accusing Trump of abusing his power by asking Ukrainian officials to announce investigations that would benefit his reelection and of obstructing Congress .
Every Democrat voted for the first article except Reps. Jefferson Van Drew of New Jersey and Collin Peterson of Minnesota . Rep. Jared Golden of Maine joined Van Drew and Peterson as the only Democrats to vote against the second article , obstruction of Congress .
Every Republican voted against both articles . The House ’ s lone independent , former Republican Justin Amash of Michigan , voted with the Democrats to impeach Trump on both charges .
The 230 votes to impeach Trump on the first article is slightly higher than the 228 votes that one of the articles against President Bill Clinton received in 1998 .
But Republicans are gleeful about the fact that , unlike in 1998 , no one on their side crossed party lines to vote to impeach one of their own .
`` Every single Republican voted for us , '' Trump crowed at his rally . “ We did n't lose one Republican vote . ''
Lawmakers are now voting on a second article , charging Trump with obstructing their investigation .
Though the historic vote ended a hurried effort by Democrats to advance impeachment articles before the end of the year – House Speaker Nancy Pelosi launched the inquiry into Trump ’ s actions less than three months ago – it will kick off an exceptionally rare trial in the Senate to determine whether the president will be removed from office .
White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said the impeachment culminated in one of the most shameful episodes in history .
“ Throughout the House Democrats ’ entire sham impeachment , the President was denied fundamental fairness and due process under the law , ” Grisham said in a statement . “ The House blatantly ignored precedent and conducted the inquiry in secrecy behind closed doors so that Chairman Adam Schiff and his partisan political cronies could selectively leak information to their partners in the media to push a false narrative . “
“ The President is confident the Senate will restore regular order , fairness , and due process , all of which were ignored in the House proceedings , ” Grisham said . “ He is prepared for the next steps and confident that he will be fully exonerated . President Trump will continue to work tirelessly to address the needs and priorities of the American people , as he has since the day he took office . ”
Rep. Tulsi Gabbard , D-Hawaii , who voted present on both articles of impeachment , said she worked for the best interests of the country whether in the military or in Congress .
“ After doing my due diligence in reviewing the 658-page impeachment report , I came to the conclusion that I could not in good conscience vote either yes or no , ” Gabbard said in a statement . “ I am standing in the center and have decided to vote Present . I could not in good conscience vote against impeachment because I believe President Trump is guilty of wrongdoing . I also could not in good conscience vote for impeachment because removal of a sitting President must not be the culmination of a partisan process , fueled by tribal animosities that have so gravely divided our country . ”
Some lawmakers used cards to vote , rather than recording their preference electronically as is usually the practice .
“ They want to actually write down their vote instead of doing it electronically on a vote of this gravity and significance , ” said Rep. Katherine Clark , D-Mass , who voted electronically .
Republicans rushed to grab the red cards , using a dais to scribble their names , state and district before waving them above their hands .
Rep. Steve King , R-Iowa , said the red and green cards were being used as “ more of a demonstration ” to show the force behind the vote .
“ It ’ s pretty lame , but it ’ s what we got , ” King said of the demonstration .
The debate drew to a close with final remarks from party leaders – some of which elicited immediate pushback from the other side .
Minority Whip Steve Scalise , R-La. , drew groans from Democrats when he accused them of not only hating Trump , but also hating the 63 million Americans who voted for him . Republicans groaned back .
“ It is an abuse of power , ” Scalise said . “ It ’ s your abuse of power . ”
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , D-Md. , said Trump was given every opportunity to prove his innocence .
“ Democrats did not choose this impeachment . We did not wish for it , ” he said . `` Oh , come on , '' several Republicans responded .
Lawmakers filled the House floor and most seats in the spectator gallery were taken when House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy , R-Calif. , taunted his Democratic colleagues with something he said they hate to hear .
“ Donald J. Trump is president of the United States , ” McCarthy said , eliciting a standing ovation from his GOP colleagues . “ He ’ s president today . He will be president tomorrow . And he will be president when this impeachment is over . ”
Throughout Rep. Adam Schiff ’ s speech , he looked at Republicans , speaking directly to them as he implored for them to uphold the Constitution over their loyalty to the president .
“ What is at risk here is the very idea of America , ” he said .
Republicans , in response , booed Schiff , some laughing or shouting things at him .
After a full day of contentious debate and without a closing comment from Pelosi , the House began voting at 8:09pm on the first of two articles of impeachment : whether Trump committed an abuse of power by pressuring Ukraine to undertake investigations that would help him politically .
Democrats are expected to have the 216 votes needed to pass the article . All Republicans are expected to oppose it .
The chamber is full enough many lawmakers and staffers from both parties are standing in the back of their respective sides .
Some of the moderate Democrats who have the most at stake politically and who helped tipped Pelosi ’ s hand on beginning the impeachment inquiry entered the chamber together shortly before the voting began .
“ See you on the other end , ” said Rep. Elissa Slotkin , D-Mich. , who represents a district Trump won in 2016 .
One Democrat , freshman Rep. Jared Golden of Maine , has said he will vote for the first article but not for the second , which charges Trump with obstructing Congress in its investigation. “ We have bipartisan opposition to impeachment , not bipartisan support , ” said Rep. Mark Meadows , R-N.C .
Trump struck an upbeat tone after arriving in Battle Creek for a rally as the House neared conclusion of the impeachment debate .
“ Doing good , ” he said to shouted questions from reporters as he deplaned from Air Force One and climbed into his limousine .
About 150 people who ’ d braved Michigan ’ s below-freezing temperatures to wait for Trump ’ s arrival cheered him on .
After calling impeachment an embarrassment for House Democrats , Rep. Lee Zeldin , R-N.Y. , laid into House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff .
Zeldin repeated GOP complaints about the way Schiff handled the impeachment inquiry , concluding : “ It ’ s a total Schiff show . ”
Zeldin is not the first Republican to use that wordplay on Schiff ’ s last name .
In November , Trump was even more explicit when he tweeted : “ Gee , Pelosi & Schitt have a good idea , ‘ lets Impeach the President . ’ ”
For his part , Schiff smiled as he returned to the microphone after Zeldin 's remarks .
From a 'perfect ' call to a party switch : How we got to the impeachment of Donald Trump
Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff , D-Calif. , tried to rebut the Republican argument that there 's no impeachable offense because Ukraine eventually received the delayed military funds .
“ My colleagues continue to make the argument that the Ukrainians got the money , ” Schiff said . “ Yes , the president got caught but they got the money , no harm , no foul . It ’ s the equivalent of saying , ` If you ’ re pulled over by a cop and you attempt to bribe the cop , and the cop doesn ’ t take the money but arrests you , where ’ s the crime in that ? ' ”
Schiff 's comments drew booing from the Republican side of the chamber .
Michigan Rep. Justin Amash , an independent who left the Republican Party last summer , was welcomed on the Democratic side of the House with pats on the shoulder and handshakes from smiling colleagues after saying he would vote to impeach Trump .
“ His actions reflect precisely the type of conduct the framers of the Constitution intended to remedy through the power of impeachment , ” Amash said .
He was the only Republican in the House to call for Trump ’ s impeachment following the release of special counsel Robert Mueller 's investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 election and its aftermath earlier this year .
Amash said Wednesday that Trump abused and violated the public trust by soliciting the aid of a foreign power for his own personal and political gain .
He told ███ after his floor remarks that he might have been able to convince his former Republican colleagues to vote for impeachment earlier in the process . But , Amash added , “ The deeper we ’ ve gotten into it , the more people feel like they have to stick with their team , if you will , to survive . ”
Some Democrats have approached Amash about helping present the case against Trump when the proceedings move to the Senate .
Asked if he ’ s interested in being an impeachment manager , Amash replied : “ I ’ m happy to have a conversation with the speaker . ”
While House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been the Democrats ’ face of impeachment , Adam Schiff has been the workhorse of the effort .
As chair of the House Intelligence Committee , the California Democrat led the sharp questioning of key witnesses that laid out Trump ’ s role in Ukraine . And he has been able to succinctly articulate the complexities of the committee ’ s findings to the public .
Halfway through Wednesday ’ s floor debate , Schiff stepped up to the dais to summarize the testimony and characterize the president as someone consumed by personal advancement .
“ He doesn ’ t care about Ukraine or the impact on our national security caused by withholding military aid to that country fighting for its democratic life , ” he said . “ All that matters to this president is what affects him personally : an investigation into his political rival and a chance to cheat in the next election . ”
Later , Schiff turned to his GOP colleagues and chided them for choosing party over country .
“ Many of my colleagues appear to have made their choice to protect the president , to enable him to be above the law , to empower this president to cheat again as long as it is in the service of their party and their power , ” he said . “ They have made their choice and I believe they will rue the day that they did . ”
One of the most fiery exchanges came after Rep. Louie Gohmert , R-Texas , accused Democrats of using impeachment to stop an investigation into Ukraine ’ s interference in the 2016 election .
Democrats have noted that U.S. intelligence services found that Russia meddled in the election and FBI Director Christopher Wray told ABC News that there is “ no information that indicates that Ukraine interfered with the 2016 presidential election . ”
Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler , D-N.Y. , said it was “ deeply concerned that any member of the House would spout Russian propaganda on the floor of the House . ”
Russia has blamed Ukraine for its own interference in the election .
Gohmert , who was still at his lectern , pointed at Nadler and said he should get a chance to respond , but he was n't recognized .
`` He calls me guilty of Russian propaganda , '' Gohmert shouted over the pounding of the gavel . Gohmert walked past Nadler as he left the chamber for a brief exchange .
Rep. Jeff Van Drew plans to vote as a Democrat against impeachment
Rep. Jeff Van Drew , D-N.J. , told reporters an announcement on his party change was coming soon .
`` I 'm thinking this through , how I want to announce it , ” he said . “ Then I ’ m going to announce whatever I do , and at that point in time , I will make a decision and make an announcement .
`` We 'll see , '' he said when asked if he had requested a ceremony at the White House to switch parties .
Van Drew said he would still be voting as a Democrat against impeachment today .
It was a clumsy way , a serious way to remove a president from office , and we should be careful , ” he said . “ Let ’ s just have an election . Let the people decide on this . ”
Rep. Barry Loudermilk , R-Ga. , upped the ante on Republicans ’ argument that the impeachment process has been unfair to Trump .
“ One week before Christmas , I want you to keep this in mind , ” Loudermilk said during floor debate . “ Pontius Pilate afforded more rights to Jesus than the Democrats have afforded this president . ”
Specifically , Loudermilk said , Pilate gave Jesus the opportunity to face his accusers .
The House committees did n't allow Trump or his representatives to participate in the closed-door depositions or public hearings . The Judiciary Committee invited Trump to participate in its hearings , but White House counsel Pat Cipollone declined , calling the inquiry partisan and biased .
Kellyanne Conway , a special advisor to Trump speaking at the White House , said , `` I do n't like many Jesus comparisons because he is my Lord and Savior . ''
Trump also compared the impeachment process to the Salem witch trials in a Tuesday letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
`` More due process was afforded to those accused in the Salem Witch Trials , ” Trump complained in the six-page letter .
Speaking at a press conference , Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-S.C. , said he wanted the “ shortest trial possible ” for Trump .
Graham , the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee , said he would not support witnesses called by only one side .
“ I ’ m not going to support witnesses being called for by the president , ” he said . “ I ’ m not going to support witnesses being called for by Senator Schumer , ” referring the Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer , D-N.Y .
He said he would invite Trump ’ s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani to testify before his committee , adding , “ It ’ s just not good for your country to make these accusations on national television . ”
Graham said he talked to the president and the First Lady today .
When he asked Trump how he was doing , Graham said Trump replied , “ Well I ’ m being impeached . Other than that I ’ m doing okay . ”
Florida Rep. Francis Rooney , one of the few Republicans to publicly criticize President Donald Trump ’ s conduct concerning Ukraine , has decided not to support impeachment .
The congressman said he wanted the courts to rule first on the president 's claims of `` executive privilege '' preventing Congress from accessing documents and testimony before he could support impeachment .
`` Having asked numerous ex-White House Counsels and well-known government attorneys , there can be no 'obstruction of Congress ( or of justice ) ' while the person refusing to comply is relying on a claim of executive privilege , '' Rooney said in a statement released Wednesday afternoon .
“ Based on the limited evidence provided to the House of Representatives , the President ’ s behavior , while inappropriate , was neither criminal , nor does it rise to the level of justifying impeachment , '' he said .
In October , Rooney told CNN the situation was “ certainly very , very serious and troubling . I do n't think you can rule ( impeachment ) out until you know all the facts . ''
The next day , he told Fox News he would not seek a third term in 2020 , following a torrent of criticism from Republicans who view his willingness to question Trump ’ s conduct as tantamount to betrayal .
Rooney ’ s decision to oppose both articles of impeachment denies Democrats a chance to lure a House Republican to their side .
In the middle of impeachment debate on the House floor , Trump attacked Democrats and their effort to impeach him on Twitter .
`` SUCH ATROCIOUS LIES BY THE RADICAL LEFT , DO NOTHING DEMOCRATS . THIS IS AN ASSAULT ON AMERICA , AND AN ASSAULT ON THE REPUBLICAN PARTY ! ! ! ! , '' he tweeted .
The president steadily tweeted and re-tweeted – mostly about impeachment – at least two dozen times by 1 p.m. EST
Trump tweets : President calls impeachment accusations 'atrocious lies ' as House vote looms
Five House members missed the vote on setting the rules for the impeachment debate , including Rep. Tulsi Gabbard , one of the Democrats seeking the presidential nomination to take on Trump in 2020 .
Gabbard ’ s office didn ’ t immediately explain her absence . Gabbard hasn ’ t voted on the House floor since Dec. 11 and has missed more than one-third of floor votes this year .
Gabbard , who has declined to say whether she supports either article of impeachment , introduced a resolution Wednesday to censure Trump . ( A censure resolution expresses strong disapproval of conduct , whereas impeachment could result in removal from office . )
Among the others who missed one of the day ’ s major votes , retiring Rep. Jose Serrano , D-N.Y. , has been absent due to illness ; Rep. Duncan Hunter , R-Calif. , was barred from voting after pleading guilty this month to campaign finance violations ; and retiring Rep. John Shimkus is visiting his son in Tanzania .
While Rep. Ruben Gallego , D-Ariz. , missed the vote on approving the debate rules , he sided with his party minutes before in the procedural step calling for the vote .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi “ solemnly and sadly ” opened the debate with a floor speech that drew on the nation ’ s founders and the reason they enshrined impeachment in the Constitution .
“ Our founders ’ vision of a republic is under threat from actions from the White House , ” she said . “ If we do not act now , we would be derelict in our duty . It ’ s tragic the president ’ s reckless actions make impeachment necessary . He gave us no choice . ”
Pinned to the front of her dress was a replica of the mace of the House , the symbol of the chamber 's power that stands next to where the speaker sits on the dais .
As she spoke about the danger of foreign interference in U.S. elections , the speaker stood next to a white poster board of a fluttering American flag with the words : “ To the Republic for which it stands… ”
“ Today , we are here to defend democracy for the people , ” she said . “ May god bless America . ”
As she finished , Democrats in the chamber applauded . Republicans did not .
Democratic lawmakers emptied out of the chamber after Pelosi 's speech , leaving mostly members of the House Judiciary Committee and their aides .
Leading off the GOP rebuttal , Georgia Rep. Doug Collins said the Founding Fathers were concerned about a partisan impeachment process in which the majority could do what it wants .
Collins dismissed the first article of impeachment – abuse of power – by saying Trump did nothing wrong . He described the second article – obstruction of Congress – as akin to petulant children saying they didn ’ t get what they wanted when they didn ’ t ask in the right way .
Fellow Republicans nodded as Collins said the GOP will take their case to American voters .
“ It is a matter for the voters , not this House . Not in this way , ” Collins said . “ The people of America see through this . ”
Rep. Chris Stewart , R-Utah , said Democrats ’ objective with impeachment was not to help fulfill a Constitutional duty , but a move taken because they wanted Hillary Clinton to win the election .
“ It ’ s shocking , I know , but it turns out some people don ’ t like President Trump , ” he said . “ Let ’ s be clear , this vote , this day has nothing to do with Ukraine . It has nothing to do with abuse of power . It has nothing to do with obstruction of Congress . ”
Stewart said Wednesday was about one thing : “ They hate this president , ” he said , adding , “ They think Hillary Clinton should be president . ”
After his remarks , Nadler had a reminder for Stewart . “ If President Trump is impeached and removed , the new president will be Mike Pence , not Hillary Clinton , '' drawing laughs and cheers from Republicans on the House floor .
As debate on the impeachment articles got underway , Vice President Mike Pence began making the case to Michigan voters that will be amplified at Trump ’ s rally tonight in Battle Creek .
`` Truthfully , friends , what 's happening on Capitol Hill today is a disgrace , ” Pence said at an event organized by the Trump campaign at a Sheraton in Saginaw . Dozens of rank-and-file union members were invited to attend by a Workers for Trump Coalition .
A man holding an “ Impeach Trump ” sign stood alone at the hotel entrance when reporters traveling with the vice president arrived at the site . A small group of onlookers snapped photos of the Trump-Pence mega bus .
Inside the hotel , Pence said Democrats are trying to impeach Trump because they can ’ t defeat him .
Michigan was one of the three “ blue wall ” states that fell to Trump in 2016 , assuring his victory .
Trump will take the stage tonight around the time the House could be holding the final impeachment votes .
After about an hour of discussion , the House voted 228 to 197 to set the rules for debating the two articles of impeachment against Trump . There will be up to six hours of debate with no amendments allowed .
The rules were approved after Democrats rejected Republicans '' attempts to block debate on the impeachment articles until certain conditions are met - including allowing Republicans to have their own impeachment hearing .
Lawmakers voted along party lines with the exception of the two Democrats who opposed the impeachment inquiry from the start : Minnesota Rep. Collin Peterson and New Jersey Rep. Jefferson Van Drew , who is expected to switch parties .
Before the vote , Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole , the Rules Committee ’ s top Republican , gave a rare compliment in the intensely-partisan debate by thanking Chairman Jim McGovern , D-Mass. , for how he conducted Tuesday ’ s committee hearing on the rules package .
“ Let me thank my friend for his kind words , ” McGovern responded , before likewise thanking Cole for his leadership .
Cole called the impeachment inquiry unfair , rushed , closed and a “ complete charade . ”
McGovern said that the central question is whether a president should be allowed to ask a foreign nation to interfere in an election .
“ I ask my colleagues to search their souls before casting their votes , ” McGovern said .
Outside the Capitol , a hearty crowd of about 200 demonstrators – bundled up in hats and scarves to brave the 33-degree winter day – waved homemade signs labeling Trump a “ criminal-in-chief ” and a “ fake president . ”
“ What a beautiful day … A beautiful day for our democracy , ” declared Nathaly Arriola , executive director of Need to Impeach , whose mission is self-explanatory . The organization was founded and is funded by Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer .
“ This has never been about the politics , ” she said . “ This has always been about the American people , and about protecting the democracy that allows us to live freely as Americans in this nation . ”
But she quickly pivoted to politics , declaring that her group would be delivering hand-held mirrors to vulnerable Republican senators – such as Colorado ’ s Cory Gardner and Maine ’ s Susan Collins – adorned with the message : “ Senator , how corrupt is too corrupt for you ? ”
The purpose of the mirrors was obvious , but she spelled it out for anyone who might need elaboration .
“ Soon they will have to look at themselves in the mirror and ask themselves ” whether they convict or acquit Trump . A failure to convict , she said , would amount to a betrayal of the U.S. Constitution .
Massachusetts Rep. Jim McGovern , the chairman of the House Rules Committee , introduced the rules for the debate , calling the proceedings a “ Democracy defining moment . ”
“ We are being tested on something greater than our ability to toe the party line , ” McGovern said .
Dismissing as “ absurd ” the GOP charge that Democrats are trying to overturn the results of the 2016 election , McGovern said failing to rebuke Trump would set a dangerous precedent .
Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole , the Rules Committee ’ s top Republican , countered that the premise of the impeachment articles is based on a “ pause of 55 days ” on military assistance to Ukraine . Cole argued there ’ s no evidence that the aid was a “ quid pro quo ” to get Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden .
“ I oppose this limited and unfair process , ” Cole said , “ and I certainly oppose impeaching the president of the United States . ”
Rep. Donna Shalala , D-Fla. , who served as President Bill Clinton ’ s Health and Human Services Secretary , told reporters she found impeachment “ painful . ”
“ None of us came here to impeach a president , ” she said .
Karon Jahn , a 69-year-old retired professor from Alaska , took advantage of the auspicious timing of her family ’ s visit to the nation ’ s capital to give her two 14-year-old grandsons an up-close lesson in American democracy .
“ We looked up the fact that it needs two-thirds vote in the Senate , ” Jahn said of the super-majority required for Trump to be convicted and removed from office . The boys are seeing “ in real time ” what they ’ ve already learned in school , she added .
Asked if she supported Trump ’ s impeachment personally , she said yes , framing the argument more succinctly than most of the Democrats on the House floor : “ We did n't elect people to do the wrong thing . ”
For Lin Huang , a 31-year-old Chinese student studying computer engineering at Texas A & M University , the process was a bit more bewildering .
“ We feel quite curious about this , ” he said as he waited in line to enter the public spectator ’ s gallery with his wife and in-laws . Huang said he was “ not quite sure ” what the impeachment debate was about , but he was eager to watch the proceedings anyway .
Amanda Lopez and Travis Tilghman , who were visiting Washington from California , said they were thrilled their visit coincided with the House impeachment debate .
“ We ’ ve both been binge watching the West Wing , so we ’ ve been looking at democracy again , ” said Lopez , a 31-year-old who works in the tech industry .
After failing to stop the proceedings , House Republicans sought a vote on a resolution accusing the Democrats who led the impeachment inquiry of abusing their power .
The resolution included a litany of complaints against Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff , D-Calif. , who ran the impeachment hearings , and Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler , D-N.Y. , who oversaw debate over the impeachment articles .
The House voted 226 to 191 to block the resolution , Rep. Collin Peterson , D-Minn. , was the only Democrat to vote with Republicans .
An hour into the proceedings , the spectator galleries overlooking the floor were not full .
Outside the Capitol , journalists with large cameras patrolled the entrances while a handful of protesters held signs , one reading , `` too much corruption to fit on one sign ! ''
Shortly after the House gaveled in , Republicans unsuccessfully tried to stop the proceedings .
Rep. Andy Biggs , R-Ariz. , asked that the House adjourn `` so we can stop wasting America 's time for impeachment . ''
The motion was dismissed on a party-line vote of 226 to 188 .
It was just the first of many procedural votes Republicans could force throughout the all-day impeachment debate .
A vote on both articles of impeachment is n't expected until later this evening .
`` Help them , and help us all , '' House Chaplain Patrick Conroy said of House members when he opened the day 's session with a prayer .
Expect a full House when the chamber convenes at 9 a.m .
In a letter to colleagues Tuesday night , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi urged everyone to `` join me on the floor . '' The letter also aims to set a tone of solemnity .
`` Our constituents look to us to be respectful of the Constitution and Defenders of our Democracy and to proceed in a manner worthy of our oath of office to support and defend the Constitution of the United States , '' Pelosi wrote .
In other words , no cheering or clapping during the votes .
Trump weighed in early with his usual mode of communication , a tweet .
“ Can you believe that I will be impeached today by the Radical Left , Do Nothing Democrats , AND I DID NOTHING WRONG ! ” he tweeted at 7:34 a.m .
House Republicans signaled they are likely to press for a procedural vote even before the House officially begins debate on impeachment .
Among the first to arrive was Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern , D-Mass. , who took a seat behind the Democratic lectern , preparing to debate the rules for floor debate on the two articles of impeachment .
Two Judiciary Committee Democrats who sent the articles to the floor – Reps. Sylvia Garcia of Texas and Steve Cohen of Tennessee – grabbed front-row seats in the chamber , chatting .
Rep. Al Green , D-Texas , one of the earliest advocates of an impeachment inquiry , walked over to shake hands with Rep. Mark Meadows , R-N.C. , one of the president 's most vocal defenders .
On the day the House of Representatives was to debate and vote on articles of impeachment against Trump , Rep. Tulsi Gabbard , D-Hawaii , introduced a resolution to censure him .
A censure resolution expresses strong disapproval of conduct , whereas impeachment could result in removal from office .
The resolution was referred to the Judiciary Committee and is unlikely to get a vote in the House .
The introduction of the resolution comes as even most moderate Democrats in the House have announced their intention to vote for the articles of impeachment . Nearly a dozen House Democrats had floated censure as an option , as reported by Politico but have since backed away from it .
Gabbard has declined to say whether she will vote for either article of impeachment .
Rep. Diana DeGette , D-Colo. , will preside over much of the impeachment proceedings on the House floor Wednesday .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi tapped the 12-term legislator from Denver for the prestigious task of what ’ s known as “ speaker pro tempore , ” which includes ruling on the points of order that guide floor debate .
“ None of us came to Congress to impeach a president , but every one of us – when we assumed office – took an oath to uphold the constitution , ” DeGette said . “ This is a sad and somber moment in our nation ’ s history and the responsibility to preside over this important debate is something I will not take lightly . ”
The House will debate the articles for six hours and then vote separately on each of them , under parameters that the House Rules Committee recommended Tuesday . The rules for floor debate must still be adopted by the full House after an hour of debate Wednesday morning . If the House approves the articles , lawmakers will immediately take up a resolution naming managers who will serve essentially as prosecutors in the Senate trial , which is expected to begin in January .
Democrats hold a 233-197 majority in the House , with one independent and four vacancies , and the votes on the articles are expected to largely follow party lines . Republican leaders have said they expect all of their members to oppose impeachment .
Rep. Justin Amash , an independent from Michigan , is expected to vote with Democrats in favor of impeachment . One Democrat , Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey , announced he would vote against it and he might switch parties . Another Democrat , Rep. Jared Golden of Maine , told the Bangor Daily News he would support impeachment for abuse of power , but not obstruction of Congress . And a few Democrats , including Reps. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii , Ron Kind of Wisconsin and Collin Peterson of Minnesota , have n't announced how they will vote .
The Judiciary Committee recommended by party-line vote the articles that accused Trump of pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rival , former Vice President Joe Biden . The committee also accused Trump of obstructing their work by directing aides and agencies to defy congressional subpoenas for documents and testimony .
`` He acted in a way that rises to the level of impeachment , '' said House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern , D-Mass. , whose panel set the rules Tuesday for floor debate .
But Trump attacked the investigation Tuesday as an attempted partisan coup and urged House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif. , to call off the vote . Congressional Republicans called the Intelligence Committee investigation `` flawed '' and `` defective , '' in the words of Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma .
The three committees investigating Ukraine – Foreign Affairs , Intelligence , and Oversight and Reform – did n't allow Trump or his representatives to participate in their closed-door depositions or public hearings , but the time for Democratic and Republican questions was equally divided . The Judiciary Committee invited Trump to participate in its hearings , but White House counsel Pat Cipollone declined , calling the inquiry partisan and biased .
“ The entire circus has been politically motivated from the very beginning , '' said Cole , the top Republican on the Rules Committee .
If the House approves one or both of the articles , the Senate will hold a trial to decide whether to convict Trump and remove him from office . A two-thirds majority of the Senate is required for removal , which is considered unlikely with Republicans holding a 53-47 majority in the chamber .
Only two other presidents have faced Senate impeachment trials – Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1999 – and neither was removed from office . Former President Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 before a House vote on articles of impeachment .
Anti-impeachment ad blitz : Donald Trump 's allies target Democrats in swing districts
Trump sent Pelosi a six-page letter expressing his “ most powerful protest against the partisan impeachment crusade ” and urging her not to hold a vote on `` this impeachment fantasy . ''
“ This impeachment represents an unprecedented and unconstitutional abuse of power by Democrat Lawmakers , unequaled in nearly two and a half centuries of American legislative history , ” Trump said .
The president said more due process was provided during the Salem witch trials than during this inquiry , which he called “ nothing more than an illegal , partisan attempted coup . ”
“ They include no crimes , no misdemeanors , and no offenses whatsoever , ” Trump said . “ You have cheapened the importance of the very ugly word , impeachment ! ”
But Rep. Jamie Raskin , D-Md. , who presented the Judiciary Committee 's report to the Rules Committee , said the investigation by the Foreign Affairs , Intelligence , and Oversight and Reform panels gathered overwhelming evidence against Trump from thousands of pages of documents and 100 hours of depositions with 17 sworn witnesses .
`` These articles charge that President Trump has engaged in systematic abuse of his powers , obstructed Congress , and realized the worst fears of the Framers by subordinating our national security and dragging foreign powers into American politics to corrupt our elections , all for the greater cause of his own personal gain and ambition , '' Raskin said .
███ Poll : Impeached or not , Trump leads his Democratic rivals for another term","USA TODAY

Follow along for live updates:

President Donald Trump has become the third president in history to be impeached after the House voted to approve both articles of impeachment over his request of Ukraine to investigate political rivals.

After a day of tense debate and fiery recriminations, the House voted largely along partisan lines, reshuffling American politics at time when voters are profoundly divided over the nation’s leadership and direction.

The Democratic-led House approved both articles of impeachment accusing Trump of abusing his power by asking Ukrainian officials to announce investigations that would benefit his reelection and of obstructing Congress.

As the House voted, Trump rallied onstage in Michigan.

Every Democrat voted for the first article except Reps. Jefferson Van Drew of New Jersey and Collin Peterson of Minnesota. Rep. Jared Golden of Maine joined Van Drew and Peterson as the only Democrats to vote against the second article, obstruction of Congress.

Every Republican voted against both articles. The House’s lone independent, former Republican Justin Amash of Michigan, voted with the Democrats to impeach Trump on both charges.

The 230 votes to impeach Trump on the first article is slightly higher than the 228 votes that one of the articles against President Bill Clinton received in 1998.

But Republicans are gleeful about the fact that, unlike in 1998, no one on their side crossed party lines to vote to impeach one of their own.

""Every single Republican voted for us,"" Trump crowed at his rally. “We didn't lose one Republican vote.""

Lawmakers are now voting on a second article, charging Trump with obstructing their investigation.

Though the historic vote ended a hurried effort by Democrats to advance impeachment articles before the end of the year – House Speaker Nancy Pelosi launched the inquiry into Trump’s actions less than three months ago – it will kick off an exceptionally rare trial in the Senate to determine whether the president will be removed from office.

Republican leaders expect that trial to begin in mid-January.

The White House responds

White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said the impeachment culminated in one of the most shameful episodes in history.

“Throughout the House Democrats’ entire sham impeachment, the President was denied fundamental fairness and due process under the law,” Grisham said in a statement. “The House blatantly ignored precedent and conducted the inquiry in secrecy behind closed doors so that Chairman Adam Schiff and his partisan political cronies could selectively leak information to their partners in the media to push a false narrative. “

“The President is confident the Senate will restore regular order, fairness, and due process, all of which were ignored in the House proceedings,” Grisham said. “He is prepared for the next steps and confident that he will be fully exonerated. President Trump will continue to work tirelessly to address the needs and priorities of the American people, as he has since the day he took office.”

Tulsi Gabbard voted 'present'

Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, who voted present on both articles of impeachment, said she worked for the best interests of the country whether in the military or in Congress.

“After doing my due diligence in reviewing the 658-page impeachment report, I came to the conclusion that I could not in good conscience vote either yes or no,” Gabbard said in a statement. “I am standing in the center and have decided to vote Present. I could not in good conscience vote against impeachment because I believe President Trump is guilty of wrongdoing. I also could not in good conscience vote for impeachment because removal of a sitting President must not be the culmination of a partisan process, fueled by tribal animosities that have so gravely divided our country.”

-Bart Jansen

Voting with cards

Some lawmakers used cards to vote, rather than recording their preference electronically as is usually the practice.

“They want to actually write down their vote instead of doing it electronically on a vote of this gravity and significance,” said Rep. Katherine Clark, D-Mass, who voted electronically.

Republicans rushed to grab the red cards, using a dais to scribble their names, state and district before waving them above their hands.

Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, said the red and green cards were being used as “more of a demonstration” to show the force behind the vote.

“It’s pretty lame, but it’s what we got,” King said of the demonstration.

Closing arguments

The debate drew to a close with final remarks from party leaders – some of which elicited immediate pushback from the other side.

Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., drew groans from Democrats when he accused them of not only hating Trump, but also hating the 63 million Americans who voted for him. Republicans groaned back.

“It is an abuse of power,” Scalise said. “It’s your abuse of power.”

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said Trump was given every opportunity to prove his innocence.

“Democrats did not choose this impeachment. We did not wish for it,” he said. ""Oh, come on,"" several Republicans responded.

Lawmakers filled the House floor and most seats in the spectator gallery were taken when House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., taunted his Democratic colleagues with something he said they hate to hear.

“Donald J. Trump is president of the United States,” McCarthy said, eliciting a standing ovation from his GOP colleagues. “He’s president today. He will be president tomorrow. And he will be president when this impeachment is over.”

Throughout Rep. Adam Schiff’s speech, he looked at Republicans, speaking directly to them as he implored for them to uphold the Constitution over their loyalty to the president.

“What is at risk here is the very idea of America,” he said.

Republicans, in response, booed Schiff, some laughing or shouting things at him.

Voting begins

After a full day of contentious debate and without a closing comment from Pelosi, the House began voting at 8:09pm on the first of two articles of impeachment: whether Trump committed an abuse of power by pressuring Ukraine to undertake investigations that would help him politically.

Democrats are expected to have the 216 votes needed to pass the article. All Republicans are expected to oppose it.

The chamber is full enough many lawmakers and staffers from both parties are standing in the back of their respective sides.

Some of the moderate Democrats who have the most at stake politically and who helped tipped Pelosi’s hand on beginning the impeachment inquiry entered the chamber together shortly before the voting began.

“See you on the other end,” said Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., who represents a district Trump won in 2016.

One Democrat, freshman Rep. Jared Golden of Maine, has said he will vote for the first article but not for the second, which charges Trump with obstructing Congress in its investigation.“We have bipartisan opposition to impeachment, not bipartisan support,” said Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C.

Trump onstage in Michigan

Trump struck an upbeat tone after arriving in Battle Creek for a rally as the House neared conclusion of the impeachment debate.

“Doing good,” he said to shouted questions from reporters as he deplaned from Air Force One and climbed into his limousine.

About 150 people who’d braved Michigan’s below-freezing temperatures to wait for Trump’s arrival cheered him on.

The `Schiff show’

After calling impeachment an embarrassment for House Democrats, Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., laid into House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff.

Zeldin repeated GOP complaints about the way Schiff handled the impeachment inquiry, concluding: “It’s a total Schiff show.”

Zeldin is not the first Republican to use that wordplay on Schiff’s last name.

In November, Trump was even more explicit when he tweeted: “Gee, Pelosi & Schitt have a good idea, ‘lets Impeach the President.’”

For his part, Schiff smiled as he returned to the microphone after Zeldin's remarks.

From a 'perfect' call to a party switch:How we got to the impeachment of Donald Trump

Republicans boo Adam Schiff

Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., tried to rebut the Republican argument that there's no impeachable offense because Ukraine eventually received the delayed military funds.

“My colleagues continue to make the argument that the Ukrainians got the money,” Schiff said. “Yes, the president got caught but they got the money, no harm, no foul. It’s the equivalent of saying, `If you’re pulled over by a cop and you attempt to bribe the cop, and the cop doesn’t take the money but arrests you, where’s the crime in that?'”

Schiff's comments drew booing from the Republican side of the chamber.

A former Republican speaks

Michigan Rep. Justin Amash, an independent who left the Republican Party last summer, was welcomed on the Democratic side of the House with pats on the shoulder and handshakes from smiling colleagues after saying he would vote to impeach Trump.

“His actions reflect precisely the type of conduct the framers of the Constitution intended to remedy through the power of impeachment,” Amash said.

He was the only Republican in the House to call for Trump’s impeachment following the release of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 election and its aftermath earlier this year.

Amash said Wednesday that Trump abused and violated the public trust by soliciting the aid of a foreign power for his own personal and political gain.

He told USA TODAY after his floor remarks that he might have been able to convince his former Republican colleagues to vote for impeachment earlier in the process. But, Amash added, “The deeper we’ve gotten into it, the more people feel like they have to stick with their team, if you will, to survive.”

Some Democrats have approached Amash about helping present the case against Trump when the proceedings move to the Senate.

Asked if he’s interested in being an impeachment manager, Amash replied: “I’m happy to have a conversation with the speaker.”

Schiff: ‘A chance to cheat in the next election’

While House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been the Democrats’ face of impeachment, Adam Schiff has been the workhorse of the effort.

As chair of the House Intelligence Committee, the California Democrat led the sharp questioning of key witnesses that laid out Trump’s role in Ukraine. And he has been able to succinctly articulate the complexities of the committee’s findings to the public.

Halfway through Wednesday’s floor debate, Schiff stepped up to the dais to summarize the testimony and characterize the president as someone consumed by personal advancement.

“He doesn’t care about Ukraine or the impact on our national security caused by withholding military aid to that country fighting for its democratic life,” he said. “All that matters to this president is what affects him personally: an investigation into his political rival and a chance to cheat in the next election.”

Later, Schiff turned to his GOP colleagues and chided them for choosing party over country.

“Many of my colleagues appear to have made their choice to protect the president, to enable him to be above the law, to empower this president to cheat again as long as it is in the service of their party and their power,” he said. “They have made their choice and I believe they will rue the day that they did.”

Getting testy

One of the most fiery exchanges came after Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, accused Democrats of using impeachment to stop an investigation into Ukraine’s interference in the 2016 election.

Democrats have noted that U.S. intelligence services found that Russia meddled in the election and FBI Director Christopher Wray told ABC News that there is “no information that indicates that Ukraine interfered with the 2016 presidential election.”

Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., said it was “deeply concerned that any member of the House would spout Russian propaganda on the floor of the House.”

Russia has blamed Ukraine for its own interference in the election.

Gohmert, who was still at his lectern, pointed at Nadler and said he should get a chance to respond, but he wasn't recognized.

""He calls me guilty of Russian propaganda,"" Gohmert shouted over the pounding of the gavel. Gohmert walked past Nadler as he left the chamber for a brief exchange.

Rep. Jeff Van Drew plans to vote as a Democrat against impeachment

Rep. Jeff Van Drew, D-N.J., told reporters an announcement on his party change was coming soon.

""I'm thinking this through, how I want to announce it,” he said. “Then I’m going to announce whatever I do, and at that point in time, I will make a decision and make an announcement.

""We'll see,"" he said when asked if he had requested a ceremony at the White House to switch parties.

Van Drew said he would still be voting as a Democrat against impeachment today.

It was a clumsy way, a serious way to remove a president from office, and we should be careful,” he said. “Let’s just have an election. Let the people decide on this.”

Republican: Crucifixion of Christ was fairer

Rep. Barry Loudermilk, R-Ga., upped the ante on Republicans’ argument that the impeachment process has been unfair to Trump.

“One week before Christmas, I want you to keep this in mind,” Loudermilk said during floor debate. “Pontius Pilate afforded more rights to Jesus than the Democrats have afforded this president.”

Specifically, Loudermilk said, Pilate gave Jesus the opportunity to face his accusers.

The House committees didn't allow Trump or his representatives to participate in the closed-door depositions or public hearings. The Judiciary Committee invited Trump to participate in its hearings, but White House counsel Pat Cipollone declined, calling the inquiry partisan and biased.

Kellyanne Conway, a special advisor to Trump speaking at the White House, said, ""I don't like many Jesus comparisons because he is my Lord and Savior.""

Trump also compared the impeachment process to the Salem witch trials in a Tuesday letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

""More due process was afforded to those accused in the Salem Witch Trials,” Trump complained in the six-page letter.

Graham wants 'shortest trial possible' in Senate

Speaking at a press conference, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he wanted the “shortest trial possible” for Trump.

Graham, the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he would not support witnesses called by only one side.

“I’m not going to support witnesses being called for by the president,” he said. “I’m not going to support witnesses being called for by Senator Schumer,” referring the Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.

He said he would invite Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani to testify before his committee, adding, “It’s just not good for your country to make these accusations on national television.”

Graham said he talked to the president and the First Lady today.

When he asked Trump how he was doing, Graham said Trump replied, “Well I’m being impeached. Other than that I’m doing okay.”

GOP critic of Trump to oppose impeachment

Florida Rep. Francis Rooney, one of the few Republicans to publicly criticize President Donald Trump’s conduct concerning Ukraine, has decided not to support impeachment.

The congressman said he wanted the courts to rule first on the president's claims of ""executive privilege"" preventing Congress from accessing documents and testimony before he could support impeachment.

""Having asked numerous ex-White House Counsels and well-known government attorneys, there can be no 'obstruction of Congress (or of justice)' while the person refusing to comply is relying on a claim of executive privilege,"" Rooney said in a statement released Wednesday afternoon.

“Based on the limited evidence provided to the House of Representatives, the President’s behavior, while inappropriate, was neither criminal, nor does it rise to the level of justifying impeachment,"" he said.

In October, Rooney told CNN the situation was “certainly very, very serious and troubling. I don't think you can rule (impeachment) out until you know all the facts.""

The next day, he told Fox News he would not seek a third term in 2020, following a torrent of criticism from Republicans who view his willingness to question Trump’s conduct as tantamount to betrayal.

Rooney’s decision to oppose both articles of impeachment denies Democrats a chance to lure a House Republican to their side.

Trump calls impeachment 'assault on America'

In the middle of impeachment debate on the House floor, Trump attacked Democrats and their effort to impeach him on Twitter.

""SUCH ATROCIOUS LIES BY THE RADICAL LEFT, DO NOTHING DEMOCRATS. THIS IS AN ASSAULT ON AMERICA, AND AN ASSAULT ON THE REPUBLICAN PARTY!!!!,"" he tweeted.

The president steadily tweeted and re-tweeted – mostly about impeachment – at least two dozen times by 1 p.m. EST

Trump tweets:President calls impeachment accusations 'atrocious lies' as House vote looms

Tulsi Gabbard, others miss rules vote

Five House members missed the vote on setting the rules for the impeachment debate, including Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, one of the Democrats seeking the presidential nomination to take on Trump in 2020.

Gabbard’s office didn’t immediately explain her absence. Gabbard hasn’t voted on the House floor since Dec. 11 and has missed more than one-third of floor votes this year.

Gabbard, who has declined to say whether she supports either article of impeachment, introduced a resolution Wednesday to censure Trump. (A censure resolution expresses strong disapproval of conduct, whereas impeachment could result in removal from office.)

Among the others who missed one of the day’s major votes, retiring Rep. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y., has been absent due to illness; Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., was barred from voting after pleading guilty this month to campaign finance violations; and retiring Rep. John Shimkus is visiting his son in Tanzania.

While Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., missed the vote on approving the debate rules, he sided with his party minutes before in the procedural step calling for the vote.

Pelosi: 'He gave us no choice'

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi “solemnly and sadly” opened the debate with a floor speech that drew on the nation’s founders and the reason they enshrined impeachment in the Constitution.

“Our founders’ vision of a republic is under threat from actions from the White House,” she said. “If we do not act now, we would be derelict in our duty. It’s tragic the president’s reckless actions make impeachment necessary. He gave us no choice.”

Pinned to the front of her dress was a replica of the mace of the House, the symbol of the chamber's power that stands next to where the speaker sits on the dais.

As she spoke about the danger of foreign interference in U.S. elections, the speaker stood next to a white poster board of a fluttering American flag with the words: “To the Republic for which it stands…”

“Today, we are here to defend democracy for the people,” she said. “May god bless America.”

As she finished, Democrats in the chamber applauded. Republicans did not.

- Ledyard King

Collins: The people 'see through this'

Democratic lawmakers emptied out of the chamber after Pelosi's speech, leaving mostly members of the House Judiciary Committee and their aides.

Leading off the GOP rebuttal, Georgia Rep. Doug Collins said the Founding Fathers were concerned about a partisan impeachment process in which the majority could do what it wants.

Collins dismissed the first article of impeachment – abuse of power – by saying Trump did nothing wrong. He described the second article – obstruction of Congress – as akin to petulant children saying they didn’t get what they wanted when they didn’t ask in the right way.

Fellow Republicans nodded as Collins said the GOP will take their case to American voters.

“It is a matter for the voters, not this House. Not in this way,” Collins said. “The people of America see through this.”

- Maureen Groppe

Stewart: 'They hate this president'

Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, said Democrats’ objective with impeachment was not to help fulfill a Constitutional duty, but a move taken because they wanted Hillary Clinton to win the election.

“It’s shocking, I know, but it turns out some people don’t like President Trump,” he said. “Let’s be clear, this vote, this day has nothing to do with Ukraine. It has nothing to do with abuse of power. It has nothing to do with obstruction of Congress.”

Stewart said Wednesday was about one thing: “They hate this president,” he said, adding, “They think Hillary Clinton should be president.”

After his remarks, Nadler had a reminder for Stewart. “If President Trump is impeached and removed, the new president will be Mike Pence, not Hillary Clinton,"" drawing laughs and cheers from Republicans on the House floor.

In Michigan, Pence pushes back

As debate on the impeachment articles got underway, Vice President Mike Pence began making the case to Michigan voters that will be amplified at Trump’s rally tonight in Battle Creek.

""Truthfully, friends, what's happening on Capitol Hill today is a disgrace,” Pence said at an event organized by the Trump campaign at a Sheraton in Saginaw. Dozens of rank-and-file union members were invited to attend by a Workers for Trump Coalition.

A man holding an “Impeach Trump” sign stood alone at the hotel entrance when reporters traveling with the vice president arrived at the site. A small group of onlookers snapped photos of the Trump-Pence mega bus.

Inside the hotel, Pence said Democrats are trying to impeach Trump because they can’t defeat him.

Michigan was one of the three “blue wall” states that fell to Trump in 2016, assuring his victory.

Trump will take the stage tonight around the time the House could be holding the final impeachment votes.

House approves impeachment debate rules

After about an hour of discussion, the House voted 228 to 197 to set the rules for debating the two articles of impeachment against Trump. There will be up to six hours of debate with no amendments allowed.

The rules were approved after Democrats rejected Republicans'' attempts to block debate on the impeachment articles until certain conditions are met - including allowing Republicans to have their own impeachment hearing.

Lawmakers voted along party lines with the exception of the two Democrats who opposed the impeachment inquiry from the start: Minnesota Rep. Collin Peterson and New Jersey Rep. Jefferson Van Drew, who is expected to switch parties.

Before the vote, Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole, the Rules Committee’s top Republican, gave a rare compliment in the intensely-partisan debate by thanking Chairman Jim McGovern, D-Mass., for how he conducted Tuesday’s committee hearing on the rules package.

“Let me thank my friend for his kind words,” McGovern responded, before likewise thanking Cole for his leadership.

But there the friendliness ended.

Cole called the impeachment inquiry unfair, rushed, closed and a “complete charade.”

McGovern said that the central question is whether a president should be allowed to ask a foreign nation to interfere in an election.

“I ask my colleagues to search their souls before casting their votes,” McGovern said.

Protesters descend on Capitol

Outside the Capitol, a hearty crowd of about 200 demonstrators – bundled up in hats and scarves to brave the 33-degree winter day – waved homemade signs labeling Trump a “criminal-in-chief” and a “fake president.”

“What a beautiful day … A beautiful day for our democracy,” declared Nathaly Arriola, executive director of Need to Impeach, whose mission is self-explanatory. The organization was founded and is funded by Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer.

“This has never been about the politics,” she said. “This has always been about the American people, and about protecting the democracy that allows us to live freely as Americans in this nation.”

But she quickly pivoted to politics, declaring that her group would be delivering hand-held mirrors to vulnerable Republican senators – such as Colorado’s Cory Gardner and Maine’s Susan Collins – adorned with the message: “Senator, how corrupt is too corrupt for you?”

The purpose of the mirrors was obvious, but she spelled it out for anyone who might need elaboration.

“Soon they will have to look at themselves in the mirror and ask themselves” whether they convict or acquit Trump. A failure to convict, she said, would amount to a betrayal of the U.S. Constitution.

“And Americans will hold them accountable,” she added.

- Deirdre Shesgreen

Debate begins on how to proceed

Massachusetts Rep. Jim McGovern, the chairman of the House Rules Committee, introduced the rules for the debate, calling the proceedings a “Democracy defining moment.”

“We are being tested on something greater than our ability to toe the party line,” McGovern said.

Dismissing as “absurd” the GOP charge that Democrats are trying to overturn the results of the 2016 election, McGovern said failing to rebuke Trump would set a dangerous precedent.

Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole, the Rules Committee’s top Republican, countered that the premise of the impeachment articles is based on a “pause of 55 days” on military assistance to Ukraine. Cole argued there’s no evidence that the aid was a “quid pro quo” to get Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.

“I oppose this limited and unfair process,” Cole said, “and I certainly oppose impeaching the president of the United States.”

Rep. Donna Shalala, D-Fla., who served as President Bill Clinton’s Health and Human Services Secretary, told reporters she found impeachment “painful.”

“None of us came here to impeach a president,” she said.

Tourists there to witness debate

Karon Jahn, a 69-year-old retired professor from Alaska, took advantage of the auspicious timing of her family’s visit to the nation’s capital to give her two 14-year-old grandsons an up-close lesson in American democracy.

“We looked up the fact that it needs two-thirds vote in the Senate,” Jahn said of the super-majority required for Trump to be convicted and removed from office. The boys are seeing “in real time” what they’ve already learned in school, she added.

Asked if she supported Trump’s impeachment personally, she said yes, framing the argument more succinctly than most of the Democrats on the House floor: “We didn't elect people to do the wrong thing.”

For Lin Huang, a 31-year-old Chinese student studying computer engineering at Texas A&M University, the process was a bit more bewildering.

“We feel quite curious about this,” he said as he waited in line to enter the public spectator’s gallery with his wife and in-laws. Huang said he was “not quite sure” what the impeachment debate was about, but he was eager to watch the proceedings anyway.

Amanda Lopez and Travis Tilghman, who were visiting Washington from California, said they were thrilled their visit coincided with the House impeachment debate.

“We’ve both been binge watching the West Wing, so we’ve been looking at democracy again,” said Lopez, a 31-year-old who works in the tech industry.

“It’s corrupt,” said Tilghman, 35

Another GOP protest fails

After failing to stop the proceedings, House Republicans sought a vote on a resolution accusing the Democrats who led the impeachment inquiry of abusing their power.

The resolution included a litany of complaints against Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who ran the impeachment hearings, and Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., who oversaw debate over the impeachment articles.

The House voted 226 to 191 to block the resolution, Rep. Collin Peterson, D-Minn., was the only Democrat to vote with Republicans.

An hour into the proceedings, the spectator galleries overlooking the floor were not full.

Outside the Capitol, journalists with large cameras patrolled the entrances while a handful of protesters held signs, one reading, ""too much corruption to fit on one sign!""

GOP motion to adjourn fails

Shortly after the House gaveled in, Republicans unsuccessfully tried to stop the proceedings.

Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., asked that the House adjourn ""so we can stop wasting America's time for impeachment.""

The motion was dismissed on a party-line vote of 226 to 188.

It was just the first of many procedural votes Republicans could force throughout the all-day impeachment debate.

A vote on both articles of impeachment isn't expected until later this evening.

""Help them, and help us all,"" House Chaplain Patrick Conroy said of House members when he opened the day's session with a prayer.

Pelosi: 'Join me on the floor'

Expect a full House when the chamber convenes at 9 a.m.

In a letter to colleagues Tuesday night, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi urged everyone to ""join me on the floor."" The letter also aims to set a tone of solemnity.

""Our constituents look to us to be respectful of the Constitution and Defenders of our Democracy and to proceed in a manner worthy of our oath of office to support and defend the Constitution of the United States,"" Pelosi wrote.

In other words, no cheering or clapping during the votes.

Trump weighed in early with his usual mode of communication, a tweet.

“Can you believe that I will be impeached today by the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, AND I DID NOTHING WRONG!” he tweeted at 7:34 a.m.

House Republicans signaled they are likely to press for a procedural vote even before the House officially begins debate on impeachment.

Among the first to arrive was Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern, D-Mass., who took a seat behind the Democratic lectern, preparing to debate the rules for floor debate on the two articles of impeachment.

Two Judiciary Committee Democrats who sent the articles to the floor – Reps. Sylvia Garcia of Texas and Steve Cohen of Tennessee – grabbed front-row seats in the chamber, chatting.

Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, one of the earliest advocates of an impeachment inquiry, walked over to shake hands with Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., one of the president's most vocal defenders.

Tulsi Gabbard introduces censure resolution

On the day the House of Representatives was to debate and vote on articles of impeachment against Trump, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, introduced a resolution to censure him.

A censure resolution expresses strong disapproval of conduct, whereas impeachment could result in removal from office.

The resolution was referred to the Judiciary Committee and is unlikely to get a vote in the House.

The introduction of the resolution comes as even most moderate Democrats in the House have announced their intention to vote for the articles of impeachment. Nearly a dozen House Democrats had floated censure as an option, as reported by Politico but have since backed away from it.

Gabbard has declined to say whether she will vote for either article of impeachment.

Colorado lawmaker to preside over floor debate

Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colo., will preside over much of the impeachment proceedings on the House floor Wednesday.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi tapped the 12-term legislator from Denver for the prestigious task of what’s known as “speaker pro tempore,” which includes ruling on the points of order that guide floor debate.

“None of us came to Congress to impeach a president, but every one of us – when we assumed office – took an oath to uphold the constitution,” DeGette said. “This is a sad and somber moment in our nation’s history and the responsibility to preside over this important debate is something I will not take lightly.”

- Ledyard King

How the vote will happen

The House will debate the articles for six hours and then vote separately on each of them, under parameters that the House Rules Committee recommended Tuesday. The rules for floor debate must still be adopted by the full House after an hour of debate Wednesday morning. If the House approves the articles, lawmakers will immediately take up a resolution naming managers who will serve essentially as prosecutors in the Senate trial, which is expected to begin in January.

Democrats hold a 233-197 majority in the House, with one independent and four vacancies, and the votes on the articles are expected to largely follow party lines. Republican leaders have said they expect all of their members to oppose impeachment.

Rep. Justin Amash, an independent from Michigan, is expected to vote with Democrats in favor of impeachment. One Democrat, Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, announced he would vote against it and he might switch parties. Another Democrat, Rep. Jared Golden of Maine, told the Bangor Daily News he would support impeachment for abuse of power, but not obstruction of Congress. And a few Democrats, including Reps. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Ron Kind of Wisconsin and Collin Peterson of Minnesota, haven't announced how they will vote.

The Judiciary Committee recommended by party-line vote the articles that accused Trump of pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden. The committee also accused Trump of obstructing their work by directing aides and agencies to defy congressional subpoenas for documents and testimony.

""He acted in a way that rises to the level of impeachment,"" said House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern, D-Mass., whose panel set the rules Tuesday for floor debate.

But Trump attacked the investigation Tuesday as an attempted partisan coup and urged House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to call off the vote. Congressional Republicans called the Intelligence Committee investigation ""flawed"" and ""defective,"" in the words of Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma.

The three committees investigating Ukraine – Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Oversight and Reform – didn't allow Trump or his representatives to participate in their closed-door depositions or public hearings, but the time for Democratic and Republican questions was equally divided. The Judiciary Committee invited Trump to participate in its hearings, but White House counsel Pat Cipollone declined, calling the inquiry partisan and biased.

“The entire circus has been politically motivated from the very beginning,"" said Cole, the top Republican on the Rules Committee.

If the House approves one or both of the articles, the Senate will hold a trial to decide whether to convict Trump and remove him from office. A two-thirds majority of the Senate is required for removal, which is considered unlikely with Republicans holding a 53-47 majority in the chamber.

Only two other presidents have faced Senate impeachment trials – Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1999 – and neither was removed from office. Former President Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 before a House vote on articles of impeachment.

Anti-impeachment ad blitz:Donald Trump's allies target Democrats in swing districts

Trump sent Pelosi a six-page letter expressing his “most powerful protest against the partisan impeachment crusade” and urging her not to hold a vote on ""this impeachment fantasy.""

“This impeachment represents an unprecedented and unconstitutional abuse of power by Democrat Lawmakers, unequaled in nearly two and a half centuries of American legislative history,” Trump said.

The president said more due process was provided during the Salem witch trials than during this inquiry, which he called “nothing more than an illegal, partisan attempted coup.”

“They include no crimes, no misdemeanors, and no offenses whatsoever,” Trump said. “You have cheapened the importance of the very ugly word, impeachment!”

But Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., who presented the Judiciary Committee's report to the Rules Committee, said the investigation by the Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Oversight and Reform panels gathered overwhelming evidence against Trump from thousands of pages of documents and 100 hours of depositions with 17 sworn witnesses.

""These articles charge that President Trump has engaged in systematic abuse of his powers, obstructed Congress, and realized the worst fears of the Framers by subordinating our national security and dragging foreign powers into American politics to corrupt our elections, all for the greater cause of his own personal gain and ambition,"" Raskin said.

Democrats contended that the White House’s defense, which began on Saturday, further underscored the need for the Senate to call witnesses; Trump’s team mocked the Democratic case for lacking first-hand witnesses, even though Trump blocked them from testifying.

Democrats have sought testimony from Bolton, Mulvaney and two senior White House budget officials believed to have first-hand knowledge of Trump’s decision to withhold military aid from Ukraine. Other witnesses testified that they came to believe that Trump withheld the aid and a White House meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in order to pressure the country to launch politically motivated investigations, but those witnesses pointed to others — like Bolton and Mulvaney — who would know better than they would.

Charles Cooper, Bolton’s attorney, said in a statement that the White House’s review process of the manuscript had been “corrupted.” A printed manuscript of the book was delivered to the National Security Council’s Records Management Division on December 30 to review for classified information.

“We submitted the manuscript notwithstanding our firm belief that the manuscript contained no information that could reasonably be considered classified and on the assurance that the ""process of reviewing submitted materials is restricted to those career government officials and employees regularly charged with responsibility for such reviews"" and that the “contents of Ambassador Bolton’s manuscript will not be reviewed or otherwise disclosed to any persons not regularly involved in that process,"" Cooper said in a statement.

“It is clear, regrettably, from The New York Times article published today that the prepublication review process has been corrupted and that information has been disclosed by persons other than those properly involved in reviewing the manuscript,” Cooper added.

Why Nancy Pelosi Is Going All in Against Trump,,Molly Ball,"Nancy Pelosi isn ’ t wild about the question . The impeachment of President Donald Trump is under way , and I ’ ve asked the Speaker of the House if she thinks it ’ s the most important thing she ’ ll ever do . We ’ re sitting in her elegant office in the Capitol , on gold-upholstered armchairs around a low table topped with a vase of hydrangeas . Over her shoulder , the sweeping view of the National Mall is shrouded in wintry clouds . For a long moment , the Speaker goes silent as she seems to compile in her mind the list of accomplishments she ’ d rather claim as her legacy .
“ Apart from declaring war , this is the most important thing that the Congress can do , ” she finally says . “ I ’ m most proud of the Affordable Care Act . But this is the most serious initiative that I ’ ve been involved in in my career . ”
Pelosi has spent decades at the highest levels of politics , but the past 12 months have been arguably her most consequential . Returning to the speakership after eight years running the House Democratic minority , she established herself as counterweight and constrainer of this divisive President . She outmaneuvered Trump on policy , from the border wall he didn ’ t get to the budget agreement he signed loaded with goodies that Democrats wanted . She oversaw an unprecedented litigation effort against the Executive Branch , racking up landmark court victories . And she was the tactician behind the investigation that resulted in Trump ’ s impeachment on Dec. 18 .
What is most striking about this moment in Pelosi ’ s career is that at the peak of power , she is not protecting her position but rather using it in aggressive , even risky ways . Impeaching Trump is a gamble for Pelosi . It has intensified Republicans ’ fealty to the President , rallying his base and supercharging his campaign fundraising , potentially increasing his re-election chances . The polarizing effort could jeopardize Democrats who hold seats in Trump territory , and thereby endanger Pelosi ’ s House majority . With impeachment , Pelosi is betting her own place in history .
Pelosi has always been a risk-taker , from defying Chinese authorities by protesting at Tiananmen Square in 1991 to pushing Obamacare through the House with nary a vote to spare in 2010 . But she is careful to cast impeachment not as a political gambit but as a project to preserve the checks and balances of American democracy . “ That ’ s my responsibility : to protect the Constitution of the United States , ” she says .
That battle is playing out on multiple fronts . As Congress returned and Trump launched the country into a potential conflict with Iran , Pelosi sought to rein him in . The House planned to vote Jan. 9 on a war powers resolution designed to limit the President ’ s ability to escalate the conflict . The behind-the-scenes court battle that Pelosi has field-marshaled aims not just to check Trump ’ s current power grabs , but also to set precedents that will stop future Presidents from doing the same , or worse .
And to Trump ’ s annoyance , Pelosi is declining to transmit the House ’ s two impeachment articles to the Senate . Instead of allowing Republican Senators to end the impeachment discussion with a quick vote , she is insisting that the upper chamber agree on rules for the trial first . “ That doesn ’ t mean it has to meet my standards .

A year ago , it was hardly a given that Pelosi would emerge as the foil to the Trump presidency–or even that she would be Speaker at all . After Pelosi orchestrated Democrats ’ 2018 midterm wins , an insurgent faction of the caucus moved to replace her with a younger , “ less polarizing ” figure . Pelosi squashed the uprising with characteristic discipline . Over the ensuing year , instead of holding grudges , she set to holding her diverse caucus together when ideology and identity threatened to splinter it .
For months , the Democrats ’ biggest division was over impeachment . As colleagues and activists agitated for it , Pelosi spent most of the year resisting on the grounds that it could tear the country apart–and hurt her party . All the while , however , she was laying the groundwork behind the scenes to build a case if necessary . “ It seemed like all of a sudden we were unified around an impeachment inquiry , ” says Representative Katherine Clark of Massachusetts , the vice chair of the Democratic caucus . “ But that was Nancy Pelosi using individual members and where they were to bring this to a–she always uses this word–a crescendo . So what appears to all of a sudden be a big moment is actually based on months of work . ”
From start to finish , Pelosi has kept a tighter rein on the proceedings than the public realized , from major strategic decisions to minor stagecraft . It was Pelosi who decreed that the Intelligence Committee would take the lead in the inquiry , even though impeachment is generally considered to be the Judiciary Committee ’ s purview . ( Past Judiciary hearings had devolved into a circus–particularly a Sept. 17 session in which the President ’ s former campaign manager , Corey Lewandowski , openly mocked the proceedings . ) It was Pelosi who decided that the Democrats ’ hashtag for impeachment , # TruthExposed , seemed too harsh ; they settled on # DefendOurDemocracy instead .
Pelosi refereed contentious disputes between chairmen with discretion . She signed off on every committee report and press release ; aides say she caught typos in the Intelligence Committee ’ s final report before it went out . She decreed that the articles of impeachment would be limited to Trump ’ s actions in Ukraine rather than incorporating matters related to special counsel Robert Mueller ’ s investigation , as some of her members wanted . When Judiciary Committee lawyers debated whether to spend half a day of hearings on a presentation related to Mueller ’ s obstruction-of-justice probe , they appealed the question to the Speaker , noting that the staff was split . “ Tell them I ’ m not split , ” she replied , rejecting the idea . And while she allowed the committee ’ s final report to contain references to Mueller ’ s investigation , she demanded they be deleted from the accompanying announcement .
No aspect of the spectacle was too small to escape Pelosi ’ s control . When the Intelligence Committee held its public impeachment hearings in November , Pelosi noticed that chairman Adam Schiff ’ s head reached nearly to the top of his high-backed chair . After Intelligence finished its work , Judiciary , chaired by Representative Jerry Nadler , was slated to hold hearings in the same room . Pelosi thought if he sat in the same chair , Nadler–a head shorter than Schiff–would look small .
Pelosi sent word down : there would have to be a change of furniture . And when Judiciary convened on Dec. 4 , Nadler was seated in a leather-backed chair that reached no higher than his ears .

Impeachment was the culmination of Pelosi ’ s broader effort to hold Trump in check . For the past year , she has overseen investigations by six different congressional committees digging into everything from Trump ’ s tax returns and allegations of Administration corruption to foreign emoluments and the Russian entanglements Mueller helped uncover . Congressional committees tend to be territorial , but Pelosi convened the six committees ’ chairmen weekly , and sometimes more often , to ensure they didn ’ t duplicate efforts or step on one another ’ s toes .
She has also guided a far-reaching effort to rein in Trump through the courts . She hired a 40-year Justice Department veteran , Douglas Letter , to head the House general counsel ’ s office , a secretive team of nine lawyers , and confers with him on every legal filing , every subpoena . Together they have chosen cases designed to set precedents that affirm Congress ’ powers and shore up the institution . “ She ’ s calling the shots , ” Letter tells TIME , in a rare interview . Starting with his job interview , Letter says , Pelosi correctly predicted that “ we would get stonewalled ” by Trump and his lawyers , and would have to litigate in the courts more than usual . “ She insisted we would try to pick , particularly for subpoena enforcement , really good cases . ”
Courts tend to view litigation between the Legislative and Executive branches with unease . Judges are leery of refereeing what they view as essentially political disputes . But Pelosi and Letter ’ s approach has produced a string of victories . Courts have ruled in favor of releasing Trump ’ s tax returns and other financial records , compelled the release of grand-jury materials from the Mueller investigation and dismissed the Administration ’ s arguments for blocking witnesses . In a blistering November opinion , U.S. District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson ruled that Donald McGahn , Trump ’ s former White House counsel , must testify , and that the Administration ’ s argument to the contrary “ simply has no basis in the law. ” She added , “ The primary takeaway from the past 250 years of recorded American history is that Presidents are not kings . ”
As those court cases got tied up in appeals , though , progress in the courts did little to satisfy those eager to use the ultimate tool of presidential accountability . Pelosi resisted impeachment throughout the summer , even as more and more members of her caucus endorsed it . “ Many of them were out there for impeachment like a year ago , right after we won , ” she says , but she insisted on moving deliberately in order to make the strongest possible case . “ I said we ’ ll go down this path when we ’ re ready , ” Pelosi says . She told her colleagues that they had to wait for the investigation and litigation to play out .
The frustration built outside of Congress too . In her San Francisco district in August , Pelosi appeared at a banquet in her honor–the “ Heart of the Resistance ” dinner . She had barely begun to speak when a group of young activists rose in the back , standing on chairs and unfurling black fabric banners with white lettering . time to IMPEACH , they said . WE CAN ’ T WAIT . A young woman shouted , “ People are being killed by white supremacists ! ” A man said , “ We are your constituents ! ” As the crowd chanted , “ Let her speak , ” a burly labor organizer got in the activists ’ faces , and for a moment it seemed as if they might come to blows before hotel security escorted the protesters out .
“ It ’ s O.K. , ” Pelosi said from her position at the front of the room . “ I ’ m going to speak . I ’ m the Speaker of the House ! ” When she did speak , however , the word impeachment did not escape her lips .

A few weeks later , the Ukraine scandal changed the short-term politics and the long-term stakes . In mid-September , media outlets started to report that Trump had tried to bully his Ukrainian counterpart , Volodymyr Zelensky , into publicly announcing an investigation of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden , using White House access and congressionally approved foreign aid as leverage . His actions had alarmed government officials , leading an intelligence-community whistle-blower to file a secret complaint .
Trump had applied the pressure during a phone call in July , the day after Mueller testified before Congress . To House Democrats , it seemed Trump was setting a dangerous precedent of presidential impunity , soliciting foreign assistance in the 2020 election just as he ’ d been accused of doing in 2016 . “ I was one of those who were very reluctant to proceed ” with impeachment , says Representative Ed Perlmutter , a Democrat from Colorado who is close to Pelosi despite trying to block her from the speakership after the 2018 midterms . “ But putting people ’ s lives at risk by holding up that aid money , extorting the Ukrainian President to do the political bidding of the President–that was something that changed the calculation for everybody . ”
Pelosi had already begun preparations toward impeachment when , at 5 p.m. on Monday , Sept. 23 , she took a call from a group of seven freshman Democrats . All of them had military and intelligence backgrounds ; all had flipped Republican districts ; all had opposed impeachment to this point . Now they told her they were jointly writing an op-ed , to appear that evening on the Washington Post ’ s website , endorsing an impeachment inquiry . “ We have devoted our lives to the service and security of our country , ” the op-ed read . “ These allegations are stunning , both in the national security threat they pose and the potential corruption they represent . ”
Flying back to Washington from New York City that night , Pelosi began drafting an announcement in her looping cursive hand on a piece of loose-leaf paper . The next morning , the Speaker was in her airy Georgetown penthouse condo when she received an unscheduled call from the President . It was 8:16 a.m. Trump was in New York , preparing for a speech to the U.N . The subject of the call was ostensibly gun control , a topic dear to Pelosi ’ s heart . But that turned out to be a pretext .
Trump quickly turned to the subject of the July 25 Zelensky conversation . There was “ no pressure at all , ” he insisted , according to a source familiar with the conversation between Pelosi and the President . The call was “ 100 % perfect . I didn ’ t ask him for anything. ” Trump added , “ Literally , you would be impressed by my lack of pressure . ”
Pelosi was unconvinced . “ Mr . President , ” she said , “ we have a problem here. ” She repeatedly urged the President to release the still hidden whistle-blower complaint that had set off the controversy . And she reminded him that as the longest-serving member of the House Intelligence Committee , this allegation was “ in my wheelhouse. ” As the conversation grew tense , she urged him one more time to release the complaint . “ I have to go give a speech , ” Trump said , and hung up .
To Pelosi , Trump ’ s belief that the Zelensky call was “ perfect ” showed an inability to distinguish right from wrong . For months , she had believed voters in the 2020 election should be the ones to remove Trump from office . Now she was increasingly convinced it would be dangerous to allow him to continue his term without rebuke .
At 4 p.m. that afternoon , she met with her caucus and outlined her plan to announce an impeachment inquiry . There were no objections . As her 5 p.m. announcement drew near , an aide tugged at her sleeve , urging her to go upstairs and run through the speech just once before she went out and delivered it . Finally she turned on him , snapping , “ I walk into rooms and read teleprompters all the time . That ’ s what we ’ ll do . ”
Then it was time to face the cameras for history . “ The actions taken to date by the President have seriously violated the Constitution , ” Pelosi said . “ The President must be held accountable . No one is above the law . ”

Now that the House has impeached Trump in a nearly party-line vote , it ’ s fair to ask how much Pelosi ’ s careful management of the process achieved . The Senate Republican leader , Mitch McConnell , has declared he will work to ensure Trump is acquitted . McConnell ’ s Democratic counterpart , Chuck Schumer , seems to agree that Trump ’ s acquittal is a foregone conclusion . “ I don ’ t want to second-guess ” the outcome , Schumer tells TIME . “ But these Republicans are not the Republicans of old . They are totally supine in their obeisance to Trump. ” Yet Schumer agrees with Pelosi that “ we have no choice , given the President ’ s lack of respect for democracy and the Constitution . ”
Republicans gloat that impeachment has strengthened Trump politically–that somehow , a process designed by the founders to constrain a President has perversely achieved the opposite . Trump ’ s re-election campaign has harnessed his supporters ’ outrage over impeachment to raise buckets of money . As the drama played out over the final three months of 2019 , Trump raked in $ 46 million , his best quarterly haul of the year and more than any of his Democratic rivals have raised over a similar period . Within 72 hours of Pelosi ’ s Sept. 24 announcement that Democrats would move forward with an impeachment inquiry , the Trump campaign pulled in $ 15 million in small-dollar donations .
Critics accuse Pelosi of caving to pressure and violating her own conditions to pursue Trump ’ s impeachment . Even Republicans who aren ’ t big Trump fans have “ been sort of driven toward him by this–they do feel that Democrats overplayed their hand , ” says Representative Peter King , a New York Republican . “ This whole thing has been a rush to judgment . ”
But Pelosi ’ s allies say holding out until the Ukraine scandal broke strengthened her hand . “ It ’ s made her an even more powerful voice in this moment , ” says Representative David Cicilline , Democrat of Rhode Island . “ She resisted this for so long because she really understood the consequences to the country . That gives her tremendous credibility with the American people when she came to the conclusion it was necessary . ”

It ’ s an open question whether Pelosi ’ s gamble has the public ’ s support . In polls , a slight plurality of Americans–just over 49 % –support Trump ’ s impeachment , according to averages tabulated by FiveThirtyEight . That number shot up after the scandal began , and is historically high , but it has barely budged since October , and Trump ’ s approval rating has remained steady in the low 40s as well . Democratic pollster Geoff Garin says that despite GOP claims to the contrary , “ there ’ s no evidence that impeachment has changed the fundamental dynamics of the 2020 election. ” Trump ’ s opponents , he contends , are even more galvanized by impeachment than his supporters are . And by November 2020 , Garin says , the data suggest that voters will base their decisions far more on issues like health care than on impeachment .
In mid-December , I sat down with Pelosi again and asked her to respond to some of the criticism of the process . The Speaker was battling a lingering winter cold , and was in the midst of last-minute negotiations with the White House and Senate on a $ 1.4 trillion spending deal to avert a shutdown while sharply cutting back Trump ’ s requested border funding .
The idea of a rush to impeachment exasperates the Speaker , who points out that the White House limited the evidence available with its unprecedented stonewalling . And Pelosi contends that the process is merely an extension of the prior investigations of Trump . “ This has been going on for 2½ years , since the Justice Department tasked Director Mueller to go into the investigation , ” she says . “ It ’ s been going on for a long time . The aha moment was Ukraine . But the pattern of behavior was very self-evident over time . ”
Many Democrats hoped some Republicans might support impeachment ; Pelosi claims nothing ever surprises her . “ It ’ s disappointing to see that they are ignoring their own oath of office , ” she says . “ The President must be held accountable . And the fact that the Republicans are even in denial of the factual basis of what happened is sad for our country . ”
On Dec. 17 , the night before the full House would debate and vote on Trump ’ s impeachment , Pelosi met behind closed doors with top caucus members on the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee . She hinted , for the first time , that she was contemplating a curveball : declining to immediately transmit the impeachment articles to the Senate after the House passed them . “ The rule empowers the Speaker to be able to decide how to send the articles and when to send the articles over to the Senate , ” she said , according to an aide who was in the room . “ My view is we don ’ t know enough about what they are going to do . We want to see what [ is ] their level of fairness and openness and the rest . ”
Pelosi , according to an aide , had been mulling the tactic since she heard former Nixon White House counsel John Dean float the idea on CNN on Dec. 5 . In the committee meeting , she added that she believed McConnell would be motivated to move . “ Somebody said to me today that he may not even take up what we send . [ But ] then [ Trump ] will never be vindicated , ” she said , according to the aide in the room . “ He will be impeached forever . Forever . No matter what the Senate does . ”
The following day , Pelosi presided over the floor vote on impeachment , wearing a striking black suit to project solemnity , accessorized with a large gold brooch of the Mace of the Republic , a symbol of the House . When scattered cheers broke out inside the chamber after the first article was approved , she sternly and silently shushed them with a glare and a sharp gesture . After the vote , she announced that she did not plan to transmit the articles right away , saying she could not determine how to appoint House impeachment managers until the Senate decides on its rules for the trial .
McConnell has mocked the idea that Pelosi or Schumer can shape the Senate trial to their liking . But he ’ s also said he won ’ t start it until Pelosi sends the articles , and it ’ s clear from Trump ’ s tweets and statements that the unresolved situation bothers him . Moreover , the delay is allowing facts to emerge . Over the two-week holiday break , newly unredacted emails showed Pentagon officials worrying about the legality of Trump ’ s effort to withhold military aid from Ukraine . And on Jan. 6 , former National Security Adviser John Bolton , potentially a key witness to Trump ’ s alleged actions toward Ukraine , announced he would testify before the Senate if subpoenaed . On Jan. 7 , McConnell announced that he had enough Republican votes to begin the trial , and Democrats in both chambers appeared to be getting restless–but still Pelosi refused to budge .
The gambit is reminiscent of another Pelosi maneuver designed to exploit Trump ’ s insecurities . Pelosi retook the speakership a year ago amid a government shutdown triggered by Trump ’ s demand for border-wall funding . She refused to negotiate on the matter until the government reopened . As the stalemate dragged on , Pelosi seized on an unexpected source of leverage : she postponed Trump ’ s State of the Union address to Congress , knowing that he prized it as a televised set piece showcasing his power .
Then she stubbornly waited out her adversary . “ The President tried to break us in January [ 2019 ] by throwing us into a government shutdown at the same time we were transitioning into the majority , ” says Hakeem Jeffries , a Democratic Congressman from New York who serves as caucus chairman . “ We held together , and instead of breaking us , we broke him . It ended in unconditional surrender . ”

This power struggle between the branches of government was not Pelosi ’ s vision . She preferred the emphasis to be on the Democrats ’ policy agenda . She believed that kitchen-table concerns were more important to voters and wanted to show that Democrats are capable of governing . Despite Trump ’ s criticism of the “ do-nothing Democrats , ” the House has passed nearly 400 bills , most with GOP support . If there ’ s a single morning that captures how Pelosi has juggled the priorities of policymaking and oversight , it is Dec. 10 , when she led the 9 a.m. announcement of the impeachment articles , then proceeded directly to a 10 a.m. press conference to announce that the House had made a deal to pass the President ’ s revision of the North American Free Trade Agreement .
Her approach is a stark departure from how the GOP handled Barack Obama ’ s presidency–opposing Obama at every turn , determined not to give him victories even on uncontroversial matters . Pelosi and Schumer have found ways to work with Trump , particularly on trade , prescription drugs and infrastructure , an approach that rankles the left . “ Democrats should not be giving Donald Trump wins that normalize his presidency and give him a set of accomplishments to campaign on , ” says Brian Fallon of the liberal group Demand Justice . “ He benefits vastly more from a bipartisan trade deal than they do. ” In a stroke of irony , the Speaker whose moderate colleagues tried to get rid of her for fear she struck heartland voters as too far left is now hailed–or derided–as a moderating force .
Yet House Democrats from all wings of the diverse caucus say they are more unified than at any time in recent memory . “ I think we ’ re doing the very best we could , ” says Representative Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania , one of the authors of the national-security freshmen ’ s op-ed . Liberal Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York , agreed : “ It ’ s been a very disciplined approach . ”
That comity will be tested as Washington heads into an election year . More is at stake than the balance between the parties . The institutions of American democracy are being tested . The checks and balances designed by the founders depend on the coequal branches ’ ability to stand up to one another . “ She ’ s had a herculean task , and she ’ s done it brilliantly , ” says Jonathan Rose , a former Nixon and Reagan Administration lawyer affiliated with the anti-Trump conservative legal group Checks and Balances . “ I never thought I ’ d be for Nancy Pelosi in my lifetime . ”
Pelosi , for her part , won ’ t admit to any preference for her party ’ s 2020 nominee . But the Speaker , as usual , has a strategy for how she believes the Democrats should proceed . “ The message has to be one that is not menacing , ” she says . “ What works in Michigan works in San Francisco , about job creation and the rest . But what works in San Francisco may not work in Michigan . Michigan is where we must win , and we must win in the Electoral College . We won the House last year by having mobilization at the grassroots level . We have to do that again. ” The question for Democrats now may have less to do with the effects of Pelosi ’ s actions than whether they heed her advice .
This appears in the January 20 , 2020 issue of TIME .","Nancy Pelosi isn’t wild about the question. The impeachment of President Donald Trump is under way, and I’ve asked the Speaker of the House if she thinks it’s the most important thing she’ll ever do. We’re sitting in her elegant office in the Capitol, on gold-upholstered armchairs around a low table topped with a vase of hydrangeas. Over her shoulder, the sweeping view of the National Mall is shrouded in wintry clouds. For a long moment, the Speaker goes silent as she seems to compile in her mind the list of accomplishments she’d rather claim as her legacy.

“Apart from declaring war, this is the most important thing that the Congress can do,” she finally says. “I’m most proud of the Affordable Care Act. But this is the most serious initiative that I’ve been involved in in my career.”

Returning to the speakership after eight years running the House Democratic minority, she established herself as counterweight and constrainer of this divisive President. She outmaneuvered Trump on policy, from the border wall he didn’t get to the budget agreement he signed loaded with goodies that Democrats wanted. She oversaw an unprecedented litigation effort against the Executive Branch, racking up landmark court victories.

Impeaching Trump is a gamble for Pelosi. It has intensified Republicans’ fealty to the President, rallying his base and supercharging his campaign fundraising, potentially increasing his re-election chances.

Pelosi has told colleagues she’s had to wear a night guard because the White House makes her grind her teeth in her sleep. But her frustration is born of determination, not unease. In our interview, I asked her if the President’s nickname for her, Nervous Nancy, is accurate. “Pfft,” she says, waving a hand. “He’s nervous. Everything he says, he’s always projecting.

But you’re not, I ask?

“No,” she says, her voice steady. “I’m emboldened.”

A year ago, it was hardly a given that Pelosi would emerge as the foil to the Trump presidency–or even that she would be Speaker at all. After Pelosi orchestrated Democrats’ 2018 midterm wins, an insurgent faction of the caucus moved to replace her with a younger, “less polarizing” figure. Pelosi squashed the uprising with characteristic discipline. Over the ensuing year, instead of holding grudges, she set to holding her diverse caucus together when ideology and identity threatened to splinter it.

For months, the Democrats’ biggest division was over impeachment. As colleagues and activists agitated for it, Pelosi spent most of the year resisting on the grounds that it could tear the country apart–and hurt her party. All the while, however, she was laying the groundwork behind the scenes to build a case if necessary. “It seemed like all of a sudden we were unified around an impeachment inquiry,” says Representative Katherine Clark of Massachusetts, the vice chair of the Democratic caucus. “But that was Nancy Pelosi using individual members and where they were to bring this to a–she always uses this word–a crescendo. So what appears to all of a sudden be a big moment is actually based on months of work.”

From start to finish, Pelosi has kept a tighter rein on the proceedings than the public realized, from major strategic decisions to minor stagecraft. It was Pelosi who decreed that the Intelligence Committee would take the lead in the inquiry, even though impeachment is generally considered to be the Judiciary Committee’s purview. (Past Judiciary hearings had devolved into a circus–particularly a Sept. 17 session in which the President’s former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, openly mocked the proceedings.) It was Pelosi who decided that the Democrats’ hashtag for impeachment, #TruthExposed, seemed too harsh; they settled on #DefendOurDemocracy instead.

Pelosi refereed contentious disputes between chairmen with discretion. She signed off on every committee report and press release; aides say she caught typos in the Intelligence Committee’s final report before it went out. She decreed that the articles of impeachment would be limited to Trump’s actions in Ukraine rather than incorporating matters related to special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, as some of her members wanted. When Judiciary Committee lawyers debated whether to spend half a day of hearings on a presentation related to Mueller’s obstruction-of-justice probe, they appealed the question to the Speaker, noting that the staff was split. “Tell them I’m not split,” she replied, rejecting the idea. And while she allowed the committee’s final report to contain references to Mueller’s investigation, she demanded they be deleted from the accompanying announcement.

No aspect of the spectacle was too small to escape Pelosi’s control. When the Intelligence Committee held its public impeachment hearings in November, Pelosi noticed that chairman Adam Schiff’s head reached nearly to the top of his high-backed chair. After Intelligence finished its work, Judiciary, chaired by Representative Jerry Nadler, was slated to hold hearings in the same room. Pelosi thought if he sat in the same chair, Nadler–a head shorter than Schiff–would look small.

Pelosi sent word down: there would have to be a change of furniture. And when Judiciary convened on Dec. 4, Nadler was seated in a leather-backed chair that reached no higher than his ears.

Impeachment was the culmination of Pelosi’s broader effort to hold Trump in check. For the past year, she has overseen investigations by six different congressional committees digging into everything from Trump’s tax returns and allegations of Administration corruption to foreign emoluments and the Russian entanglements Mueller helped uncover. Congressional committees tend to be territorial, but Pelosi convened the six committees’ chairmen weekly, and sometimes more often, to ensure they didn’t duplicate efforts or step on one another’s toes.

She has also guided a far-reaching effort to rein in Trump through the courts. She hired a 40-year Justice Department veteran, Douglas Letter, to head the House general counsel’s office, a secretive team of nine lawyers, and confers with him on every legal filing, every subpoena. Together they have chosen cases designed to set precedents that affirm Congress’ powers and shore up the institution. “She’s calling the shots,” Letter tells TIME, in a rare interview. Starting with his job interview, Letter says, Pelosi correctly predicted that “we would get stonewalled” by Trump and his lawyers, and would have to litigate in the courts more than usual. “She insisted we would try to pick, particularly for subpoena enforcement, really good cases.”

Courts tend to view litigation between the Legislative and Executive branches with unease. Judges are leery of refereeing what they view as essentially political disputes. But Pelosi and Letter’s approach has produced a string of victories. Courts have ruled in favor of releasing Trump’s tax returns and other financial records, compelled the release of grand-jury materials from the Mueller investigation and dismissed the Administration’s arguments for blocking witnesses. In a blistering November opinion, U.S. District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson ruled that Donald McGahn, Trump’s former White House counsel, must testify, and that the Administration’s argument to the contrary “simply has no basis in the law.” She added, “The primary takeaway from the past 250 years of recorded American history is that Presidents are not kings.”

As those court cases got tied up in appeals, though, progress in the courts did little to satisfy those eager to use the ultimate tool of presidential accountability. Pelosi resisted impeachment throughout the summer, even as more and more members of her caucus endorsed it. “Many of them were out there for impeachment like a year ago, right after we won,” she says, but she insisted on moving deliberately in order to make the strongest possible case. “I said we’ll go down this path when we’re ready,” Pelosi says. She told her colleagues that they had to wait for the investigation and litigation to play out.

The frustration built outside of Congress too. In her San Francisco district in August, Pelosi appeared at a banquet in her honor–the “Heart of the Resistance” dinner. She had barely begun to speak when a group of young activists rose in the back, standing on chairs and unfurling black fabric banners with white lettering. time to IMPEACH, they said. WE CAN’T WAIT. A young woman shouted, “People are being killed by white supremacists!” A man said, “We are your constituents!” As the crowd chanted, “Let her speak,” a burly labor organizer got in the activists’ faces, and for a moment it seemed as if they might come to blows before hotel security escorted the protesters out.

“It’s O.K.,” Pelosi said from her position at the front of the room. “I’m going to speak. I’m the Speaker of the House!” When she did speak, however, the word impeachment did not escape her lips.

A few weeks later, the Ukraine scandal changed the short-term politics and the long-term stakes. In mid-September, media outlets started to report that Trump had tried to bully his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, into publicly announcing an investigation of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, using White House access and congressionally approved foreign aid as leverage. His actions had alarmed government officials, leading an intelligence-community whistle-blower to file a secret complaint.

Trump had applied the pressure during a phone call in July, the day after Mueller testified before Congress. To House Democrats, it seemed Trump was setting a dangerous precedent of presidential impunity, soliciting foreign assistance in the 2020 election just as he’d been accused of doing in 2016. “I was one of those who were very reluctant to proceed” with impeachment, says Representative Ed Perlmutter, a Democrat from Colorado who is close to Pelosi despite trying to block her from the speakership after the 2018 midterms. “But putting people’s lives at risk by holding up that aid money, extorting the Ukrainian President to do the political bidding of the President–that was something that changed the calculation for everybody.”

Pelosi had already begun preparations toward impeachment when, at 5 p.m. on Monday, Sept. 23, she took a call from a group of seven freshman Democrats. All of them had military and intelligence backgrounds; all had flipped Republican districts; all had opposed impeachment to this point. Now they told her they were jointly writing an op-ed, to appear that evening on the Washington Post’s website, endorsing an impeachment inquiry. “We have devoted our lives to the service and security of our country,” the op-ed read. “These allegations are stunning, both in the national security threat they pose and the potential corruption they represent.”

Flying back to Washington from New York City that night, Pelosi began drafting an announcement in her looping cursive hand on a piece of loose-leaf paper. The next morning, the Speaker was in her airy Georgetown penthouse condo when she received an unscheduled call from the President. It was 8:16 a.m. Trump was in New York, preparing for a speech to the U.N. The subject of the call was ostensibly gun control, a topic dear to Pelosi’s heart. But that turned out to be a pretext.

Trump quickly turned to the subject of the July 25 Zelensky conversation. There was “no pressure at all,” he insisted, according to a source familiar with the conversation between Pelosi and the President. The call was “100% perfect. I didn’t ask him for anything.” Trump added, “Literally, you would be impressed by my lack of pressure.”

Pelosi was unconvinced. “Mr. President,” she said, “we have a problem here.” She repeatedly urged the President to release the still hidden whistle-blower complaint that had set off the controversy. And she reminded him that as the longest-serving member of the House Intelligence Committee, this allegation was “in my wheelhouse.” As the conversation grew tense, she urged him one more time to release the complaint. “I have to go give a speech,” Trump said, and hung up.

To Pelosi, Trump’s belief that the Zelensky call was “perfect” showed an inability to distinguish right from wrong. For months, she had believed voters in the 2020 election should be the ones to remove Trump from office. Now she was increasingly convinced it would be dangerous to allow him to continue his term without rebuke.

At 4 p.m. that afternoon, she met with her caucus and outlined her plan to announce an impeachment inquiry. There were no objections. As her 5 p.m. announcement drew near, an aide tugged at her sleeve, urging her to go upstairs and run through the speech just once before she went out and delivered it. Finally she turned on him, snapping, “I walk into rooms and read teleprompters all the time. That’s what we’ll do.”

Then it was time to face the cameras for history. “The actions taken to date by the President have seriously violated the Constitution,” Pelosi said. “The President must be held accountable. No one is above the law.”

Now that the House has impeached Trump in a nearly party-line vote, it’s fair to ask how much Pelosi’s careful management of the process achieved. The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, has declared he will work to ensure Trump is acquitted. McConnell’s Democratic counterpart, Chuck Schumer, seems to agree that Trump’s acquittal is a foregone conclusion. “I don’t want to second-guess” the outcome, Schumer tells TIME. “But these Republicans are not the Republicans of old. They are totally supine in their obeisance to Trump.” Yet Schumer agrees with Pelosi that “we have no choice, given the President’s lack of respect for democracy and the Constitution.”

Republicans gloat that impeachment has strengthened Trump politically–that somehow, a process designed by the founders to constrain a President has perversely achieved the opposite. Trump’s re-election campaign has harnessed his supporters’ outrage over impeachment to raise buckets of money. As the drama played out over the final three months of 2019, Trump raked in $46 million, his best quarterly haul of the year and more than any of his Democratic rivals have raised over a similar period. Within 72 hours of Pelosi’s Sept. 24 announcement that Democrats would move forward with an impeachment inquiry, the Trump campaign pulled in $15 million in small-dollar donations.

Critics accuse Pelosi of caving to pressure and violating her own conditions to pursue Trump’s impeachment. Even Republicans who aren’t big Trump fans have “been sort of driven toward him by this–they do feel that Democrats overplayed their hand,” says Representative Peter King, a New York Republican. “This whole thing has been a rush to judgment.”

But Pelosi’s allies say holding out until the Ukraine scandal broke strengthened her hand. “It’s made her an even more powerful voice in this moment,” says Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island. “She resisted this for so long because she really understood the consequences to the country. That gives her tremendous credibility with the American people when she came to the conclusion it was necessary.”

It’s an open question whether Pelosi’s gamble has the public’s support. In polls, a slight plurality of Americans–just over 49%–support Trump’s impeachment, according to averages tabulated by FiveThirtyEight. That number shot up after the scandal began, and is historically high, but it has barely budged since October, and Trump’s approval rating has remained steady in the low 40s as well. Democratic pollster Geoff Garin says that despite GOP claims to the contrary, “there’s no evidence that impeachment has changed the fundamental dynamics of the 2020 election.” Trump’s opponents, he contends, are even more galvanized by impeachment than his supporters are. And by November 2020, Garin says, the data suggest that voters will base their decisions far more on issues like health care than on impeachment.

In mid-December, I sat down with Pelosi again and asked her to respond to some of the criticism of the process. The Speaker was battling a lingering winter cold, and was in the midst of last-minute negotiations with the White House and Senate on a $1.4 trillion spending deal to avert a shutdown while sharply cutting back Trump’s requested border funding.

The idea of a rush to impeachment exasperates the Speaker, who points out that the White House limited the evidence available with its unprecedented stonewalling. And Pelosi contends that the process is merely an extension of the prior investigations of Trump. “This has been going on for 2½ years, since the Justice Department tasked Director Mueller to go into the investigation,” she says. “It’s been going on for a long time. The aha moment was Ukraine. But the pattern of behavior was very self-evident over time.”

Many Democrats hoped some Republicans might support impeachment; Pelosi claims nothing ever surprises her. “It’s disappointing to see that they are ignoring their own oath of office,” she says. “The President must be held accountable. And the fact that the Republicans are even in denial of the factual basis of what happened is sad for our country.”

On Dec. 17, the night before the full House would debate and vote on Trump’s impeachment, Pelosi met behind closed doors with top caucus members on the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee. She hinted, for the first time, that she was contemplating a curveball: declining to immediately transmit the impeachment articles to the Senate after the House passed them. “The rule empowers the Speaker to be able to decide how to send the articles and when to send the articles over to the Senate,” she said, according to an aide who was in the room. “My view is we don’t know enough about what they are going to do. We want to see what [is] their level of fairness and openness and the rest.”

Pelosi, according to an aide, had been mulling the tactic since she heard former Nixon White House counsel John Dean float the idea on CNN on Dec. 5. In the committee meeting, she added that she believed McConnell would be motivated to move. “Somebody said to me today that he may not even take up what we send. [But] then [Trump] will never be vindicated,” she said, according to the aide in the room. “He will be impeached forever. Forever. No matter what the Senate does.”

The following day, Pelosi presided over the floor vote on impeachment, wearing a striking black suit to project solemnity, accessorized with a large gold brooch of the Mace of the Republic, a symbol of the House. When scattered cheers broke out inside the chamber after the first article was approved, she sternly and silently shushed them with a glare and a sharp gesture. After the vote, she announced that she did not plan to transmit the articles right away, saying she could not determine how to appoint House impeachment managers until the Senate decides on its rules for the trial.

McConnell has mocked the idea that Pelosi or Schumer can shape the Senate trial to their liking. But he’s also said he won’t start it until Pelosi sends the articles, and it’s clear from Trump’s tweets and statements that the unresolved situation bothers him. Moreover, the delay is allowing facts to emerge. Over the two-week holiday break, newly unredacted emails showed Pentagon officials worrying about the legality of Trump’s effort to withhold military aid from Ukraine. And on Jan. 6, former National Security Adviser John Bolton, potentially a key witness to Trump’s alleged actions toward Ukraine, announced he would testify before the Senate if subpoenaed. On Jan. 7, McConnell announced that he had enough Republican votes to begin the trial, and Democrats in both chambers appeared to be getting restless–but still Pelosi refused to budge.

The gambit is reminiscent of another Pelosi maneuver designed to exploit Trump’s insecurities. Pelosi retook the speakership a year ago amid a government shutdown triggered by Trump’s demand for border-wall funding. She refused to negotiate on the matter until the government reopened. As the stalemate dragged on, Pelosi seized on an unexpected source of leverage: she postponed Trump’s State of the Union address to Congress, knowing that he prized it as a televised set piece showcasing his power.

Then she stubbornly waited out her adversary. “The President tried to break us in January [2019] by throwing us into a government shutdown at the same time we were transitioning into the majority,” says Hakeem Jeffries, a Democratic Congressman from New York who serves as caucus chairman. “We held together, and instead of breaking us, we broke him. It ended in unconditional surrender.”

This power struggle between the branches of government was not Pelosi’s vision. She preferred the emphasis to be on the Democrats’ policy agenda. She believed that kitchen-table concerns were more important to voters and wanted to show that Democrats are capable of governing. Despite Trump’s criticism of the “do-nothing Democrats,” the House has passed nearly 400 bills, most with GOP support. If there’s a single morning that captures how Pelosi has juggled the priorities of policymaking and oversight, it is Dec. 10, when she led the 9 a.m. announcement of the impeachment articles, then proceeded directly to a 10 a.m. press conference to announce that the House had made a deal to pass the President’s revision of the North American Free Trade Agreement.

Her approach is a stark departure from how the GOP handled Barack Obama’s presidency–opposing Obama at every turn, determined not to give him victories even on uncontroversial matters. Pelosi and Schumer have found ways to work with Trump, particularly on trade, prescription drugs and infrastructure, an approach that rankles the left. “Democrats should not be giving Donald Trump wins that normalize his presidency and give him a set of accomplishments to campaign on,” says Brian Fallon of the liberal group Demand Justice. “He benefits vastly more from a bipartisan trade deal than they do.” In a stroke of irony, the Speaker whose moderate colleagues tried to get rid of her for fear she struck heartland voters as too far left is now hailed–or derided–as a moderating force.

Yet House Democrats from all wings of the diverse caucus say they are more unified than at any time in recent memory. “I think we’re doing the very best we could,” says Representative Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, one of the authors of the national-security freshmen’s op-ed. Liberal Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, agreed: “It’s been a very disciplined approach.”

That comity will be tested as Washington heads into an election year. More is at stake than the balance between the parties. The institutions of American democracy are being tested. The checks and balances designed by the founders depend on the coequal branches’ ability to stand up to one another. “She’s had a herculean task, and she’s done it brilliantly,” says Jonathan Rose, a former Nixon and Reagan Administration lawyer affiliated with the anti-Trump conservative legal group Checks and Balances. “I never thought I’d be for Nancy Pelosi in my lifetime.”

Pelosi, for her part, won’t admit to any preference for her party’s 2020 nominee. But the Speaker, as usual, has a strategy for how she believes the Democrats should proceed. “The message has to be one that is not menacing,” she says. “What works in Michigan works in San Francisco, about job creation and the rest. But what works in San Francisco may not work in Michigan. Michigan is where we must win, and we must win in the Electoral College. We won the House last year by having mobilization at the grassroots level. We have to do that again.” The question for Democrats now may have less to do with the effects of Pelosi’s actions than whether they heed her advice.

Trump ’ s rejection of the historical premises of the Party of Lincoln that until well into the 20th century were well understood by Republicans—and to which a good many Republicans still pay some measure of respect—has been a central theme of his presidency . In 2017 , after violent racists waving Confederate flags sparked rioting in Charlottesville , the president imagined there to be “ very fine people , on both sides ” of a dispute between bigots and those who oppose bigotry . Trump frequently has hailed slave-holding Confederate commander Robert E. Lee as “ incredible ” and “ great. ” And just this year , the president defended his remarks regarding the 2017 violence in Charlottesville—where 32-year-old Heather Heyer , a paralegal and local civil rights campaigner , was killed by a Nazi sympathizer from Ohio—with the excuse that “ I was talking about people that went because they felt very strongly about the monument to Robert E. Lee , a great general . ”

What makes Trump ’ s Civil War obsession even more bizarre is the trouble he seems to have with the question of which side actually claimed victory at Appomattox . When members of the Boston Red Sox visited the White House , Red Sox chair Tom Werner recounted that Trump “ was talking about Abraham Lincoln losing the war and said , ‘ Well , you guys have lost a game or two , but this was a war . ’ ”
Lincoln and the Union , it will be noted , did not lose the Civil War—even if the champions of the Confederacy ’ s “ Lost Cause ” continue to struggle with this fact of history . That is something Republicans who have not lost their senses might want to remind the president of as he conflates a legitimate and necessary impeachment inquiry with military conflict . The point of impeachment , as understood by the founders , is to allow the Congress to hold errant executives to account—without violence . It is an essential expression of the system of checks and balances that underpins the American experiment . Unfortunately , Trump has never gotten the point .
Trump has entered his antebellum phase . He is ranting and raving about traitors and spies and retweeting a right-wing pastor ’ s claim that “ if the Democrats are successful in removing the President from office ( which they will never be ) , it will cause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal . ”
Trump ’ s amen corner on the right has adopted the civil war framing . Rush Limbaugh says we are in the midst of a “ Cold Civil War. ” And the extremist Oath Keepers group suggests that we are “ on the verge of a HOT civil war , ” claiming that “ Like in 1859 . That ’ s where we are . ”
Democrats are aghast . The media is concerned . But the fact is that this is the Republican Party ’ s hot mess , and Republicans who seek a future in America ’ s two-party system need to back away from the cliff their president is steering toward . I respect the fact that lots of people believe the GOP is beyond redemption . But what about those who don ’ t ? Shouldn ’ t they be speaking up now ? Don ’ t Republicans need to say , for their party ’ s sake and the sake of the republic , that they will not let their president tear the country apart ? Shouldn ’ t they understand that , as former Republican senator Jeff Flake wrote on Monday , they can not continue to support “ a man who has , now more than ever , proved to be so manifestly undeserving of the highest office that we have . ”
Some Republicans have stepped up . Representative Adam Kinzinger , an Illinois Republican , read Sunday ’ s “ civil war ” tweet from the president and responded with a tweet of his own . The former Air Force pilot declared , “ I have visited nations ravaged by civil war.… I have never imagined such a quote to be repeated by a President . This is beyond repugnant . ”
Kinzinger has not gone so far as to endorse the impeachment inquiry that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced last week . But a pair of Republican governors , Phil Scott of Vermont and Charlie Baker of Massachusetts , have done the right thing—morally and politically—and endorsed it . Nevada Representative Mark Amodei has raised a lonely House Republican voice in defense of congressional oversight of the president , and Republicans for the Rule of Law has launched a $ 1 million campaign targeting Republican senators with the message that “ the country is in crisis. ” It is time , the group says , for Republicans in Congress to condemn the president ’ s behavior “ without reservation . ”
Former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld , who is challenging Trump in the 2020 Republican primaries , says , “ The Ukraine caper by the president is some combination of treason , bribery and other high crimes and misdemeanors . The one thing that ’ s absolutely clear is it is grounds for removal from office. ” Flake , the Arizona Republican who left the Senate at the beginning of this year , asserts that “ with what we now know , the president ’ s actions warrant impeachment . ”
Republicans in Congress should recognize by now that Trump ought to be held to account , just as they should recognize that his efforts to divide the country in order to avoid accountability are dangerously irresponsible . Of course , as Flake says , speaking up is politically risky—but perhaps not as risky as some believe . The latest CBS News poll shows that 55 percent of Americans support the impeachment inquiry . Yes , it has overwhelming Democratic support and an even level of backing from independents . But the reason that number is so high is because , according to the survey , 23 percent of Republicans ( almost a quarter of the party base ) says it ’ s time for this investigation to go forward . This is not the stuff of a civil war . This is the evidence of a country that could , if a few more Republicans did the right thing , begin to unite around its Constitution .","No Republican president has ever been so thoroughly at odds with the GOP’s “Party of Lincoln” history as Donald Trump.

The point of impeachment, as understood by the founders, is to allow the Congress to hold errant executives to account—without violence. It is an essential expression of the system of checks and balances that underpins the American experiment. Unfortunately, Trump has never gotten the point.

Trump has entered his antebellum phase. He is ranting and raving about traitors and spies and retweeting a right-wing pastor’s claim that “if the Democrats are successful in removing the President from office (which they will never be), it will cause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal.”

Trump’s amen corner on the right has adopted the civil war framing. Rush Limbaugh says we are in the midst of a “Cold Civil War.” And the extremist Oath Keepers group suggests that we are “on the verge of a HOT civil war,” claiming that “Like in 1859. That’s where we are.”

Democrats are aghast. The media is concerned. But the fact is that this is the Republican Party’s hot mess, and Republicans who seek a future in America’s two-party system need to back away from the cliff their president is steering toward. I respect the fact that lots of people believe the GOP is beyond redemption. But what about those who don’t? Shouldn’t they be speaking up now? Don’t Republicans need to say, for their party’s sake and the sake of the republic, that they will not let their president tear the country apart? Shouldn’t they understand that, as former Republican senator Jeff Flake wrote on Monday, they cannot continue to support “a man who has, now more than ever, proved to be so manifestly undeserving of the highest office that we have.”

Some Republicans have stepped up. Representative Adam Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican, read Sunday’s “civil war” tweet from the president and responded with a tweet of his own. The former Air Force pilot declared, “I have visited nations ravaged by civil war.… I have never imagined such a quote to be repeated by a President. This is beyond repugnant.”

Kinzinger has not gone so far as to endorse the impeachment inquiry that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced last week. But a pair of Republican governors, Phil Scott of Vermont and Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, have done the right thing—morally and politically—and endorsed it. Nevada Representative Mark Amodei has raised a lonely House Republican voice in defense of congressional oversight of the president, and Republicans for the Rule of Law has launched a $1 million campaign targeting Republican senators with the message that “the country is in crisis.” It is time, the group says, for Republicans in Congress to condemn the president’s behavior “without reservation.”

Former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld, who is challenging Trump in the 2020 Republican primaries, says, “The Ukraine caper by the president is some combination of treason, bribery and other high crimes and misdemeanors. The one thing that’s absolutely clear is it is grounds for removal from office.” Flake, the Arizona Republican who left the Senate at the beginning of this year, asserts that “with what we now know, the president’s actions warrant impeachment.”

Republicans in Congress should recognize by now that Trump ought to be held to account, just as they should recognize that his efforts to divide the country in order to avoid accountability are dangerously irresponsible. Of course, as Flake says, speaking up is politically risky—but perhaps not as risky as some believe. The latest CBS News poll shows that 55 percent of Americans support the impeachment inquiry. Yes, it has overwhelming Democratic support and an even level of backing from independents. But the reason that number is so high is because, according to the survey, 23 percent of Republicans (almost a quarter of the party base) says it’s time for this investigation to go forward. This is not the stuff of a civil war. This is the evidence of a country that could, if a few more Republicans did the right thing, begin to unite around its Constitution.",www.thenation.com,left,y2T1T0NYwuXWASrh

A question of privilege

Basically, this is a special measure that takes priority over everything else the House can do (except a motion to adjourn). Once it is raised by a member (and ruled valid by the speaker), floor action must occur on it within two legislative days.

Impeachment resolutions can be pushed to the floor through a question of privilege, according to ample past precedent. During George W. Bush’s presidency, then-Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-OH) used this tactic for impeachment articles against Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney. During Obama’s presidency, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) used it for pushing impeachment of then-IRS Commissioner John Koskinen.

There is, however, a catch: This tactic cannot force an up-or-down vote on the impeachment articles themselves.

That’s because what generally happens in response is that a motion to table — that is, to kill — the privileged motion — is brought. That vote is the first one to happen, and it usually succeeds. (This can also be done with a measure to refer the privileged motion to a committee.)

In 2017, Green argued after the violence at the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that Trump should be impeached for his “record of inciting white supremacy, sexism, bigotry, hatred, xenophobia, race-baiting, and racism.”

The impeachment articles he introduced mentioned several specific matters:

Trump saying there were “very fine people” among white supremacist protesters in Charlottesville

Trump retweeting three anti-Muslim videos

Trump’s travel ban, which Green said incited “hate and hostility”

Trump’s ban on transgender people serving in the military

Trump’s criticism of NFL players who knelt during the national anthem

Trump casting “contempt on Puerto Rican citizens” after Hurricane Maria

Trump’s insults of Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-FL)

There was one thing in particular that President Trump said which was kind of like a red rag to a bull.

It's when he said basically: ""Well things are going very well, we have all the information, and they [Democrats] have none of it.""

Well, if you want a fair trial, then maybe that information should be made available.

We keep using the word ""trial"", and the words ""jurors"" and ""witnesses"" and ""evidence"", but we must not lose sight that this is a political process.

Democrats want to call Mr Bolton, who referred to the White House's alleged political pressure on Ukraine as a ""drug deal"", according to previous witness testimony in the House of Representatives.

But the former national security adviser has said he will not consider testifying unless served with a legal summons known as a subpoena.

impeachment,Fox Online News,2,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/acting-dni-director-maguire-to-testify-before-house-intel-amid-ukraine-whistleblower-complaint-fallout,"Intel chief Maguire defends handling of Trump call complaint, calls issue ‘unprecedented’",,Brooke Singman,"Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire , in tense testimony Thursday on Capitol Hill , defended his handling of the explosive whistleblower complaint alleging President Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate the Biden family -- while calling the matter `` unprecedented . ''
But after maintaining his composure for most of the morning , his frustration showed through at the end , when House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff , D-Calif. , repeatedly pressed him to agree that the matter should be investigated .
Maguire stressed that the committee now has all of the relevant information , including the whistleblower complaint itself that was released publicly Thursday morning , and said it 's up to them to decide how to proceed .
“ The horse has left the barn , ” Maguire said . “ You have all of the information . You have the whistleblower complaint . You have the letter from the ICIG . You have the Office of Legal Counsel opinion and you have the transcript from the president . ”
Maguire also stressed that the complaint was essentially `` hearsay '' and not “ corroborated by other folks . ”
“ This is second-hand information . I am not criticizing the whistleblower , ” Maguire said . “ ... I am in no position to tell the committee to do an investigation or not to do an investigation . ”
Schiff vowed at the end `` we are gon na find out '' the backstory , including whether U.S. aid was tied in any way to Trump 's investigation request , which the president denies .
The combative conclusion of the session reflected the high tensions and enormous stakes surrounding Maguire 's appearance . The rare open hearing of the intelligence committee commanded Washington 's political attention given the implications for the newly launched impeachment inquiry against Trump , related to the whistleblower complaint .
Shortly after the hearing ended , Trump fired back on Twitter , saying : “ Adam Schiff has zero credibility . Another fantasy to hurt the Republican Party ! ”
He told reporters that the process is a “ disgrace , ” defended his Ukraine call as “ absolutely perfect ” and accused Democrats of bringing any legislative progress to a standstill .
Maguire 's reputation was also on trial Thursday . He has come under fire from Democrats for initially withholding a copy of the complaint from lawmakers . That standoff was technically resolved when the complaint was declassified , and released to the public , in advance of the hearing . But Maguire was still pressed for answers from Democratic committee members on why his office did not hand over the complaint at first .
Maguire insisted he is `` not partisan '' and `` not political , '' reminding the panel that he served under eight presidents and has taken the oath of office 11 times .
`` I have served and led through turbulent times , '' he said . `` ... My integrity has never been questioned until now . ''
However , he maintained , `` I believe that I handled this matter in full compliance with the law at all times . ”
At one point in the hearing , during a tense exchange with Rep. Eric Swalwell , D-Calif. , about allegations in the complaint of a potential “ cover-up ” regarding the Ukraine call , Maguire pushed back again by reminding the committee that the complaint was not based on direct knowledge .
“ This is second-hand information from a whistleblower . I have no knowledge if that is a true and accurate statement , ” Maguire said regarding the “ cover-up ” claim . The complaint said White House officials tried to “ lock down ” records of the call . In the same document , the whistleblower also acknowledged not being a “ direct witness ” to most of the events described , instead citing other U.S. officials who are not named .
Republican members also jumped to Maguire 's defense at the hearing , while accusing Democrats of launching an `` information warfare operation '' against Trump . Rep. Chris Stewart , R-Utah , said of Maguire : `` I think you 're nuts if you 're going to convince the American people that your cause is just by attacking this man , by impugning his character . ''
Schiff , meanwhile , questioned Maguire over the timeline of his cooperation with the committee . Maguire said he was not able to release the document at first because of executive privilege concerns and other issues . He also said he is not aware of any instance where such a complaint dealt with such `` complicated and sensitive issues . ''
`` I believe that this matter is unprecedented , '' he testified . He also said he does not know the identity of the whistleblower , but said he or she acted in `` good faith . ''
Maguire maintained that he was `` not stonewalling '' despite the delay in the release of the complaint to the committee , but following `` the law the way it was written , not the law as people might wish it to be . '' Maguire again explained that he was required to review the complaint for executive privilege .
`` It took longer than I would have liked , '' he said . `` But once the transcripts were released , no longer was there an issue of executive privilege ... so then I was able to release the information to you . ''
He added : `` At no time did I ever try to withhold information . ''
The complaint cites “ multiple White House officials with direct knowledge of the call '' between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky , and accuses Trump of attempting “ to pressure the Ukranian leader to take actions to help the President ’ s 2020 reelection bid. ” It also presents allegations that the White House tried to `` restrict access '' to records of the call .
The complaint goes on to allege that White House officials said they were `` directed '' by White House attorneys to remove the transcript of the call from the computer system where they are normally kept . Instead , the transcript was allegedly kept on a different system normally used for classified information .
WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT HAS BEEN DECLASSIFIED AND CONTAINS NO 'SURPRISES , ' GOP LAWMAKER SAYS
Meanwhile , Republicans on the committee , including Ranking Member Devin Nunes , R-Calif. , accused Democrats of orchestrating a public spectacle .
`` I want to congratulate the Democrats on the rollout of their latest information warfare operation against the president , and their extraordinary ability once again to enlist the mainstream media in their campaign , '' Nunes said , adding that “ we ’ ve been treated to an unending parade of press releases , press conferences , and fake news stories . ”
`` The released transcript of the call has already debunked that central assertion , but that did n't matter , '' he continued . `` The Democrats simply moved the goalposts and began claiming that there does n't need to be a quid pro quo for this conversation to serve as the basis for impeaching the president . ''
The White House , on Wednesday , released an unclassified version of the transcript of that controversial phone call . The memo , which does not reflect a “ verbatim transcript ” but is based on “ notes and recollections ” of those memorializing the call , shows Trump congratulating Zelensky on his election victory before Trump eventually gets to the subject of the Bidens , seeking an investigation of some kind .
Maguire says that the whistleblower complaint released Thursday `` is in alignment with what was released yesterday by the president . ''
Trump first asked Zelensky to do a `` favor '' and “ find out what happened ” with the hacking of the DNC server in 2016 . He referenced CrowdStrike , a cyber firm used by the DNC to investigate the attacks .
Then , Trump went on to seek assistance in investigating the Bidens .
“ The other thing , there ’ s a lot of talk about Biden ’ s son , that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great , ” Trump said . “ Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it…It sounds horrible to me . ”

impeachment,Newsmax - News,2,https://www.newsmax.com/politics/trump-impeachment-senate-trial/2019/12/19/id/946592/,McConnell: Senate Ensures Stability in Face of 'Unfair' House Impeachment,2019-12-19,"Mary Clare Jalonick, Laurie Kellman, Zeke Miller","The top Senate Republican on Thursday denounced the `` most unfair '' House impeachment of President Donald Trump and reassured Trump and his supporters that `` moments like this are why the United States Senate exists . ”
Signaling in the strongest terms yet that the GOP-controlled Senate will acquit Trump , Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky declared that the House impeachment “ risks deeply damaging the institutions of American government . ”
As for what the Senate should do , the Kentucky Republican said , “ It could not be clearer which outcome would serve the stabilizing , institution-preserving , fever-breaking role for which the United States Senate was created and which outcome would betray it . ''
McConnell described Trump 's impeachment as “ the most rushed , least thorough and most unfair impeachment inquiry in modern history . ”
Fighting back and using McConnell 's own words , Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York then said on the Senate floor that the Republican leader was plotting the `` most rushed , least thorough and most unfair '' impeachment trial in history by declining to agree to call witnesses including former Trump national security adviser John Bolton , who declined to testify before the House .
“ McConnell claimed the impeachment was motivated by partisan rage , ” said Schumer . “ This from the man who said proudly , ‘ I am not impartial . ' ”
McConnell accused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of being afraid to send “ their shoddy work product to the Senate ” after she threw uncertainty into the impeachment process late Wednesday by refusing to say when she would send two impeachment articles to the Senate for a trial .
He said the Democratic-controlled House “ has let its partisan rage at this particular president create a toxic new precedent that will echo well into the future . ”
The House impeached Trump on two charges—abusing his power and obstructing Congress—stemming from his pressure on Ukraine to announce investigations of his political rival as he withheld U.S. aid
McConnell said the two articles failed to meet the constitutional standard of high crimes and misdemeanors and that the House simply impeached a political foe for an abuse of power offense that is n't considered a crime .
“ The framers built the Senate to provide stability , '' McConnell said . `` To keep partisan passions from boiling over . Moments like this are why the United States Senate exists . ”
A trial in the Republican-controlled Senate would almost certainly result in Trump being acquitted of the charges .

Pelosi said House Democrats could not name impeachment managers — House prosecutors who make the case for Trump 's conviction and removal from office — until they know more about how the Senate will conduct a trial .
“ We can not name managers until we see what the process is on the Senate side , ” Pelosi said . “ And I would hope that that will be soon . ... So far we haven ’ t seen anything that looks fair to us . So hopefully it will be fair . And when we see what that is , we ’ ll send our managers . ''

White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham blasted Pelosi 's move that would potentially delay the Senate trial , where she said Trump was sure to get a “ fair shake ” compared to the House .

“ We are not having that discussion . We have done what we set out to do , '' Pelosi said .
Complicating any decision to delay are House Democrats ' arguments in recent weeks that Trump 's impeachment was needed “ urgently , '' arguing his actions were a threat to Democracy and the fairness of the 2020 election .
Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline , a member of Pelosi 's leadership team , said after her remarks that Democrats want impeachment proceedings that are “ judicious and responsible and deliberative . ”
He said that while Senate will decide its own procedures , `` the speaker ’ s only point is before she sends it over she needs to understand what that is ” because it will influence who the impeachment managers are .
Asked about never sending the articles over , Cicilline said , “ I would not speculate that anyone ’ s even contemplating that . ''","The top Senate Republican on Thursday denounced the ""most unfair"" House impeachment of President Donald Trump and reassured Trump and his supporters that ""moments like this are why the United States Senate exists.”

Signaling in the strongest terms yet that the GOP-controlled Senate will acquit Trump, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky declared that the House impeachment “risks deeply damaging the institutions of American government.”

As for what the Senate should do, the Kentucky Republican said, “It could not be clearer which outcome would serve the stabilizing, institution-preserving, fever-breaking role for which the United States Senate was created and which outcome would betray it.""

McConnell described Trump's impeachment as “the most rushed, least thorough and most unfair impeachment inquiry in modern history.”

Fighting back and using McConnell's own words, Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York then said on the Senate floor that the Republican leader was plotting the ""most rushed, least thorough and most unfair"" impeachment trial in history by declining to agree to call witnesses including former Trump national security adviser John Bolton, who declined to testify before the House.

“McConnell claimed the impeachment was motivated by partisan rage,” said Schumer. “This from the man who said proudly, ‘I am not impartial.'”

""What hypocrisy.”

McConnell accused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of being afraid to send “their shoddy work product to the Senate” after she threw uncertainty into the impeachment process late Wednesday by refusing to say when she would send two impeachment articles to the Senate for a trial.

He said the Democratic-controlled House “has let its partisan rage at this particular president create a toxic new precedent that will echo well into the future.”

The House impeached Trump on two charges—abusing his power and obstructing Congress—stemming from his pressure on Ukraine to announce investigations of his political rival as he withheld U.S. aid

McConnell said the two articles failed to meet the constitutional standard of high crimes and misdemeanors and that the House simply impeached a political foe for an abuse of power offense that isn't considered a crime.

“The framers built the Senate to provide stability,"" McConnell said. ""To keep partisan passions from boiling over. Moments like this are why the United States Senate exists.”

A trial in the Republican-controlled Senate would almost certainly result in Trump being acquitted of the charges.

In a news conference late Wednesday after the impeachment vote, Pelosi declined to say when she would send the articles to the Republican-led Senate. Until the articles are submitted, the Senate cannot hold the trial.

McConnell was meeting later Thursday with Schumer to begin negotiations on how to conduct next year's Senate trial. The two leaders have a tense relationship and McConnell holds a tactical edge if he can keep his 53-member Senate majority united.

WASHINGTON ( ███ ) - Republicans and Democrats in Congress set battle lines on Tuesday ahead of televised hearings on the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump , drawing a vow from the Democrat leading the probe to thwart “ sham investigations ” into presidential hopeful Joe Biden ’ s family .
The hearings , due to start at 10 a.m. Wednesday and continue into next week , will push the inquiry into a critical new phase , with witnesses giving their first public testimony on whether Trump pressured Ukraine to target one of the president ’ s domestic political rivals with an investigation .
Representative Adam Schiff , the Democratic chairman of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee , also said he would not allow the hearings to be derailed by a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine - not Russia - interfered in the 2016 U.S. election .
Some Republicans have defended Trump ’ s dealings with Ukraine by saying he was motivated by a desire to root out corruption in the Eastern European nation and get to the bottom of the election meddling four years ago .
Schiff ’ s comments in a note to committee members suggested he would not allow Republicans to call Biden ’ s son Hunter and the whistleblower who triggered the impeachment probe after a Trump phone call with Ukraine ’ s leader as witnesses . As leader of the Democratic majority on the intelligence panel , Schiff controls which witnesses testify .
The anonymous whistleblower set off the impeachment probe after Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a phone call on July 25 to investigate the Bidens .
The witnesses this week will be U.S. diplomats who voiced concern over Trump ’ s asking Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden , a top Democratic contender seeking to challenge Trump in the presidential election next year , and his son Hunter , who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company , on unspecified allegations of corruption .
Schiff also announced witnesses for hearings next week , some of whom were requested by Republicans , including Kurt Volker , a special envoy to Ukraine , Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs David Hale and White House National Security Council aide Tim Morrison .
Hunter Biden was not on the witness list , but a Republican aide said the party had not formally notified which of their witnesses had been rejected .
A statement from Schiff ’ s office said that he had “ accepted all of the Minority requests that are within the scope of the impeachment inquiry . ”
House Republicans met behind closed doors late on Tuesday to plot strategy over the hearings .
House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy said his party members would “ just put the facts out there ... there was no pressure . The Ukraine president said there was no pressure . There was nothing that Ukraine did ( to ) take any action and the money was released . ”
Schiff , in his note to panel members , wrote that the inquiry and hearings “ will not serve as venues for any Member to further the same sham investigations into the Bidens or into debunked conspiracies about 2016 U.S. election interference that President Trump pressed Ukraine to undertake for his personal political benefit . ”
Schiff , who has become a key target of Trump ’ s attacks in recent weeks , added that the panel would not “ facilitate ” any effort to threaten , intimidate or retaliate against the whistleblower , a U.S. intelligence official .
Only intelligence committee members and staff would be allowed to ask questions in the hearings , said Schiff , adding that Republicans ’ list of suggested witnesses was being evaluated and additional witnesses would be announced this week .
The investigation , formally launched six weeks ago by Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , has shadowed Trump ’ s presidency with the threat that he could be removed from office even as he seeks re-election next year .
“ President Trump ’ s pressure campaign was ‘ out of bounds , ’ and every time he insists that it was ‘ perfect ’ he is saying that he is above the law , ” Pelosi said on Twitter .
Trump is the fourth U.S. president to face impeachment . None were removed from office , although Richard Nixon resigned as he faced almost certain impeachment in 1974 over the Watergate scandal .
The White House has refused to cooperate with the probe and a number of administration officials have failed to show up to testify behind closed doors .
The New York Times reported on Tuesday that Trump has considered firing the intelligence community ’ s inspector general , Michael Atkinson , who first reported the whistle-blower ’ s complaints to Congress .
Trump , who appointed Atkinson in 2017 , in recent weeks has continued to discuss with aides the possibility of firing him , The Times reported here citing unnamed people familiar with the internal discussions .
For the past two weeks , House investigators have been releasing transcripts of interviews conducted behind closed doors with witnesses , including U.S. diplomats who have expressed concerns about dealings with Ukraine by administration officials and the president ’ s personal attorney , Rudy Giuliani .

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans and Democrats in Congress set battle lines on Tuesday ahead of televised hearings on the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, drawing a vow from the Democrat leading the probe to thwart “sham investigations” into presidential hopeful Joe Biden’s family.

The hearings, due to start at 10 a.m. Wednesday and continue into next week, will push the inquiry into a critical new phase, with witnesses giving their first public testimony on whether Trump pressured Ukraine to target one of the president’s domestic political rivals with an investigation.

Representative Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, also said he would not allow the hearings to be derailed by a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine - not Russia - interfered in the 2016 U.S. election.

Some Republicans have defended Trump’s dealings with Ukraine by saying he was motivated by a desire to root out corruption in the Eastern European nation and get to the bottom of the election meddling four years ago.

Schiff’s comments in a note to committee members suggested he would not allow Republicans to call Biden’s son Hunter and the whistleblower who triggered the impeachment probe after a Trump phone call with Ukraine’s leader as witnesses. As leader of the Democratic majority on the intelligence panel, Schiff controls which witnesses testify.

The anonymous whistleblower set off the impeachment probe after Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a phone call on July 25 to investigate the Bidens.

The witnesses this week will be U.S. diplomats who voiced concern over Trump’s asking Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, a top Democratic contender seeking to challenge Trump in the presidential election next year, and his son Hunter, who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, on unspecified allegations of corruption.

REPUBLICAN WITNESSES

Schiff also announced witnesses for hearings next week, some of whom were requested by Republicans, including Kurt Volker, a special envoy to Ukraine, Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs David Hale and White House National Security Council aide Tim Morrison.

Hunter Biden was not on the witness list, but a Republican aide said the party had not formally notified which of their witnesses had been rejected.

A statement from Schiff’s office said that he had “accepted all of the Minority requests that are within the scope of the impeachment inquiry.”

House Republicans met behind closed doors late on Tuesday to plot strategy over the hearings.

House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy said his party members would “just put the facts out there...there was no pressure. The Ukraine president said there was no pressure. There was nothing that Ukraine did (to) take any action and the money was released.”

Schiff, in his note to panel members, wrote that the inquiry and hearings “will not serve as venues for any Member to further the same sham investigations into the Bidens or into debunked conspiracies about 2016 U.S. election interference that President Trump pressed Ukraine to undertake for his personal political benefit.”

Schiff, who has become a key target of Trump’s attacks in recent weeks, added that the panel would not “facilitate” any effort to threaten, intimidate or retaliate against the whistleblower, a U.S. intelligence official.

Only intelligence committee members and staff would be allowed to ask questions in the hearings, said Schiff, adding that Republicans’ list of suggested witnesses was being evaluated and additional witnesses would be announced this week.

‘OUT OF BOUNDS’

The investigation, formally launched six weeks ago by Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, has shadowed Trump’s presidency with the threat that he could be removed from office even as he seeks re-election next year.

“President Trump’s pressure campaign was ‘out of bounds,’ and every time he insists that it was ‘perfect’ he is saying that he is above the law,” Pelosi said on Twitter.

Trump is the fourth U.S. president to face impeachment. None were removed from office, although Richard Nixon resigned as he faced almost certain impeachment in 1974 over the Watergate scandal.

The White House has refused to cooperate with the probe and a number of administration officials have failed to show up to testify behind closed doors.

The New York Times reported on Tuesday that Trump has considered firing the intelligence community’s inspector general, Michael Atkinson, who first reported the whistle-blower’s complaints to Congress.

Trump, who appointed Atkinson in 2017, in recent weeks has continued to discuss with aides the possibility of firing him, The Times reported here citing unnamed people familiar with the internal discussions.

For the past two weeks, House investigators have been releasing transcripts of interviews conducted behind closed doors with witnesses, including U.S. diplomats who have expressed concerns about dealings with Ukraine by administration officials and the president’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani.

Trump has intensified his attacks on the investigation ahead of the public hearings, which threaten to crowd out other issues like the economy and immigration as voters turn their minds to the November 2020 election.

Trump has denied any wrongdoing and branded the investigation a hoax. In a tweet on Tuesday, he said the Bidens should be called to testify. Biden has denied any wrongdoing related to Ukraine by him or his son.

House Democrats consider the open hearings as crucial to building public support for a vote on articles of impeachment - formal charges - against Trump.

If that occurs, the 100-seat Republican-controlled Senate would hold a trial. Republicans have so far shown little interest in removing Trump from office.

White House acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said in a court filing on Tuesday that he would not bring a lawsuit challenging a subpoena for his testimony, though he said that at Trump’s direction he would not cooperate with investigators.

The president also suggested on Tuesday that he would likely release the transcript of an April 21 conversation with Zelenskiy “before week’s end,” but gave no other details.",www.reuters.com,center,i0gl9fEovUp62Z9P

WASHINGTON – After a rancorous, bitterly partisan face-off in the Democratic-led House over the impeachment of President Donald Trump, the focus is on the GOP-controlled Senate where leaders are making plans for a trial.

Spoiler alert: It's going to be rancorous and bitterly partisan as well.

After the House approved two articles of impeachment Wednesday night against Trump, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was noncommittal about when she would send them over to the Senate, the next step in the process.

By holding off on sending the articles, Pelosi could try to exert leverage on how the Senate conducts its mandatory trial. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he wants a quick trial that would call no witnesses, conditions Democrat fiercely oppose.

Isn't it odd that a president who clamors for exoneration, who claimed loud and long that he committed no crime and did no wrong, who insisted that his request to the Ukrainian president to seek dirt on Biden in return for American financial assistance was ""perfect,"" would command the members of his own party to block testimony adverse to him – rather than hear it, cross-examine it, challenge it and thereby obtain the exoneration on the merits that he seeks?

Do innocent people behave this way?

If Trump really believes he did not commit any crimes and any impeachable offenses, why would he orchestrate blocking evidence? And who – having taken an oath to do ""impartial justice"" – would close their eyes to the truth? How could such a marathon of speeches possibly be considered a trial?

Trump will luxuriate in his victory. But the personal victory for him is a legal assault on the Constitution. The president has taken an oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. Instead, he has trashed it.

impeachment,CNN (Web News),0,https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/03/politics/trump-fires-inspector-general-michael-atkinson/index.html,Trump fires intelligence community watchdog who told Congress about whistleblower complaint that led to impeachment,2020-04-03,Jeremy Herb,"( CNN ) President Donald Trump on Friday fired Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson , who had told Congress about the whistleblower complaint that led to Trump 's impeachment , the President told Congress in a letter obtained by CNN .
Atkinson will leave his job in 30 days , Trump told the House and Senate Intelligence committees , and he has been placed on administrative leave effective immediately , according to a congressional source .
`` As is the case with regard to other positions where I , as President , have the power of appointment ... it is vital that I have the fullest confidence in the appointees serving as inspectors general , '' Trump wrote . `` That is no longer the case with regard to this Inspector General . ''
The announcement that he 's firing Atkinson late on a Friday night comes as the President is dealing with a worldwide pandemic from the novel coronavirus , which has consumed his presidency since the end of the impeachment trial only two months ago . Trump has faced widespread criticism for the federal government 's response to the outbreak , and has said the impeachment trial `` probably did '' distract him from responding to the virus ' outbreak during the trial in January and early February .
Atkinson 's firing is the latest case of the Trump administration removing officials who took part in the President 's impeachment . Trump also removed Alexander Vindman , a then-National Security Council official who had testified in the House 's proceedings , along with Vindman 's twin brother , both of whom were reassigned out of the NSC , and fired then-US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland .
Other officials , including then-US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch and her acting successor , Bill Taylor , left the Trump administration after the impeachment proceedings .
Trump also fired former FBI Director James Comey in 2017 while the FBI was investigating the President .
The congressional source said that Atkinson was informed on Friday evening that Trump had fired him . The statute for the intelligence community inspector general requires that both intelligence committees be notified 30 days before the inspector general can be dismissed , so Trump could not immediately remove Atkinson -- he could only place him on leave until the 30 days pass .
Top Democrats on the House and Senate Intelligence committees blasted the move .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in statement that Trump must `` immediately cease his attacks on those who sacrifice to keep America safe , particularly during this time of national emergency . ''
House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff of California , who led the House 's impeachment investigation , said the firing was `` another blatant attempt by the President to gut the independence of the Intelligence Community and retaliate against those who dare to expose presidential wrongdoing . ''
`` This retribution against a distinguished public servant for doing his job and informing Congress of an urgent and credible whistleblower complaint is a direct affront to the entire inspector general system , '' Schiff said in a statement .
Virginia Sen. Mark Warner , the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee , said , `` In the midst of a national emergency , it is unconscionable that the President is once again attempting to undermine the integrity of the intelligence community by firing yet another an intelligence official simply for doing his job . ''
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said the firing was `` all too familiar a pattern in this administration . ''
`` When you speak truth to power , you should be a hero . But in this administration , when you speak truth to power , all too often , you get fired , '' Schumer told CNN 's Fredricka Whitfield on Saturday .
Atkinson -- a career , nonpartisan official -- came under fire from the President 's allies last year for alerting lawmakers to the then-unknown whistleblower complaint , which Congress later learned was an allegation that Trump had sought dirt on his political rival former Vice President Joe Biden from Ukraine 's President while withholding US security aid from Kiev .
The allegation sparked a House impeachment inquiry that detailed the quid pro quo effort and led to Trump 's impeachment in December on two articles . The Senate acquitted Trump on both charges in February .
One of the former attorneys for the anonymous whistleblower , Andrew Bakaj , told CNN the firing of ICIG Michael Atkinson was not unexpected yet still `` disheartening '' and `` pretty clearly retaliation '' for his role in transmitting the initial complaint to Congress .
`` I think Atkinson was quite honorable and acted with integrity . The way he handled himself underscored his independence and neutrality . Not all IG 's have historically done that , '' said Bakaj , who no longer represents the whistleblower after they hired new legal counsel earlier this year . `` In this case you have an individual who got an allegation , did an investigation and came to an independent conclusion . This is truly a loss to the IG community and also a shot across the bow for any future whistleblowers from coming forward . ''
Bakaj said Atkinson `` had the courage to do what was right '' when he shared the whistleblower complaint with Congress despite clashing with his then-boss , then-acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire , over whether it rose to the level of `` urgent concern . ''
After the whistleblower complaint was shared with Congress , Atkinson testified before the intelligence committees , explaining how he had attempted to corroborate the complaint in order to determine it was credible and should be shared with Congress . Maguire initially pushed back on that recommendation , but the White House ultimately relented and released the complaint .
Bakaj told CNN that Atkinson 's replacement was ultimately expected and , in some ways , serves as a `` bookend '' for the impeachment saga . `` The door is finally closed , '' he said , adding that he was alerted that Trump had been planning to fire Atkinson for some time .
Maguire formally resigned from US government service in February after Trump made it clear he would not be nominated for the job full time , a source familiar with the matter told CNN .
Other top intelligence officials also have recently left the administration , after Trump picked US Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell to replace Maguire as acting director of national intelligence . Russ Travers , who was head of the National Counterterrorism Center , was fired last month by Grenell in a move that was seen as a removal of someone not perceived as loyal enough .
Republican Sens . Richard Burr of North Carolina , Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Susan Collins of Maine issued statements later Saturday on Atkinson 's removal .
`` Like any political appointee , the Inspector General serves at the behest of the Executive . However , in order to be effective , the IG must be allowed to conduct his or her work independent of internal or external pressure , '' said Burr , chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee . `` It is my hope the next nominee for the role of ICIG will uphold the same important standards laid out by Congress when we created this role . ''
Grassley said that `` Congress has been crystal clear that written reasons must be given when IGs are removed for a lack of confidence , '' adding , `` More details are needed from the administration . ''
`` The intelligence community inspector general is particularly essential to ensuring the nation 's secrets are well protected and powerful , highly invasive surveillance authorities are not abused . Going forward the ICIG must step up its focus on investigating those abuses and preventing leaks of classified information , '' he said .
Collins noted that Trump followed established procedure by notifying Congress 30 days prior to the removal of the inspector general along with the reasons for the removal in line with The Inspector General Reform Act . But she added that she `` did not find his rationale for removing Inspector General Atkinson to be persuasive . ''
`` While I recognize that the President has the authority to appoint and remove Inspectors General , I believe Inspector General Atkinson served the Intelligence Community and the American people well , and his removal was not warranted , '' Collins said .
Tom Monheim , a career intelligence official , will be the acting intelligence community inspector general , according to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence .","(CNN) President Donald Trump on Friday fired Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson , who had told Congress about the whistleblower complaint that led to Trump's impeachment, the President told Congress in a letter obtained by CNN.

Atkinson will leave his job in 30 days, Trump told the House and Senate Intelligence committees, and he has been placed on administrative leave effective immediately, according to a congressional source.

Trump did not name a permanent successor.

""As is the case with regard to other positions where I, as President, have the power of appointment ... it is vital that I have the fullest confidence in the appointees serving as inspectors general,"" Trump wrote. ""That is no longer the case with regard to this Inspector General.""

The announcement that he's firing Atkinson late on a Friday night comes as the President is dealing with a worldwide pandemic from the novel coronavirus, which has consumed his presidency since the end of the impeachment trial only two months ago. Trump has faced widespread criticism for the federal government's response to the outbreak, and has said the impeachment trial ""probably did"" distract him from responding to the virus' outbreak during the trial in January and early February.

Atkinson's firing is the latest case of the Trump administration removing officials who took part in the President's impeachment. Trump also removed Alexander Vindman, a then-National Security Council official who had testified in the House's proceedings, along with Vindman's twin brother, both of whom were reassigned out of the NSC, and fired then-US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland.

Other officials, including then-US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch and her acting successor, Bill Taylor, left the Trump administration after the impeachment proceedings.

Trump also fired former FBI Director James Comey in 2017 while the FBI was investigating the President.

The congressional source said that Atkinson was informed on Friday evening that Trump had fired him. The statute for the intelligence community inspector general requires that both intelligence committees be notified 30 days before the inspector general can be dismissed, so Trump could not immediately remove Atkinson -- he could only place him on leave until the 30 days pass.

Top Democrats on the House and Senate Intelligence committees blasted the move.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in statement that Trump must ""immediately cease his attacks on those who sacrifice to keep America safe, particularly during this time of national emergency.""

House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff of California, who led the House's impeachment investigation, said the firing was ""another blatant attempt by the President to gut the independence of the Intelligence Community and retaliate against those who dare to expose presidential wrongdoing.""

""This retribution against a distinguished public servant for doing his job and informing Congress of an urgent and credible whistleblower complaint is a direct affront to the entire inspector general system,"" Schiff said in a statement.

Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said, ""In the midst of a national emergency, it is unconscionable that the President is once again attempting to undermine the integrity of the intelligence community by firing yet another an intelligence official simply for doing his job.""

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said the firing was ""all too familiar a pattern in this administration.""

""When you speak truth to power, you should be a hero. But in this administration, when you speak truth to power, all too often, you get fired,"" Schumer told CNN's Fredricka Whitfield on Saturday.

Atkinson -- a career, nonpartisan official -- came under fire from the President's allies last year for alerting lawmakers to the then-unknown whistleblower complaint, which Congress later learned was an allegation that Trump had sought dirt on his political rival former Vice President Joe Biden from Ukraine's President while withholding US security aid from Kiev.

The allegation sparked a House impeachment inquiry that detailed the quid pro quo effort and led to Trump's impeachment in December on two articles. The Senate acquitted Trump on both charges in February.

One of the former attorneys for the anonymous whistleblower, Andrew Bakaj, told CNN the firing of ICIG Michael Atkinson was not unexpected yet still ""disheartening"" and ""pretty clearly retaliation"" for his role in transmitting the initial complaint to Congress.

""I think Atkinson was quite honorable and acted with integrity. The way he handled himself underscored his independence and neutrality. Not all IG's have historically done that,"" said Bakaj, who no longer represents the whistleblower after they hired new legal counsel earlier this year. ""In this case you have an individual who got an allegation, did an investigation and came to an independent conclusion. This is truly a loss to the IG community and also a shot across the bow for any future whistleblowers from coming forward.""

Bakaj said Atkinson ""had the courage to do what was right"" when he shared the whistleblower complaint with Congress despite clashing with his then-boss, then-acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, over whether it rose to the level of ""urgent concern.""

After the whistleblower complaint was shared with Congress, Atkinson testified before the intelligence committees, explaining how he had attempted to corroborate the complaint in order to determine it was credible and should be shared with Congress. Maguire initially pushed back on that recommendation, but the White House ultimately relented and released the complaint.

Bakaj told CNN that Atkinson's replacement was ultimately expected and, in some ways, serves as a ""bookend"" for the impeachment saga. ""The door is finally closed,"" he said, adding that he was alerted that Trump had been planning to fire Atkinson for some time.

Maguire formally resigned from US government service in February after Trump made it clear he would not be nominated for the job full time, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.

Other top intelligence officials also have recently left the administration, after Trump picked US Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell to replace Maguire as acting director of national intelligence. Russ Travers, who was head of the National Counterterrorism Center, was fired last month by Grenell in a move that was seen as a removal of someone not perceived as loyal enough.

Republican Sens. Richard Burr of North Carolina, Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Susan Collins of Maine issued statements later Saturday on Atkinson's removal.

""Like any political appointee, the Inspector General serves at the behest of the Executive. However, in order to be effective, the IG must be allowed to conduct his or her work independent of internal or external pressure,"" said Burr, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. ""It is my hope the next nominee for the role of ICIG will uphold the same important standards laid out by Congress when we created this role.""

Grassley said that ""Congress has been crystal clear that written reasons must be given when IGs are removed for a lack of confidence,"" adding, ""More details are needed from the administration.""

""The intelligence community inspector general is particularly essential to ensuring the nation's secrets are well protected and powerful, highly invasive surveillance authorities are not abused. Going forward the ICIG must step up its focus on investigating those abuses and preventing leaks of classified information,"" he said.

Collins noted that Trump followed established procedure by notifying Congress 30 days prior to the removal of the inspector general along with the reasons for the removal in line with The Inspector General Reform Act. But she added that she ""did not find his rationale for removing Inspector General Atkinson to be persuasive.""

""While I recognize that the President has the authority to appoint and remove Inspectors General, I believe Inspector General Atkinson served the Intelligence Community and the American people well, and his removal was not warranted,"" Collins said.

Tom Monheim, a career intelligence official, will be the acting intelligence community inspector general, according to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.

The impeachment process would strengthen Democrats ’ legal case for enforcing subpoenas , but it would open them to political attacks from Republicans who already say they are rushing toward a predetermined outcome -- and one that would be rejected in the GOP-controlled Senate .
The White House has been goading Democrats into opening an impeachment proceeding by fighting many of the current subpoenas on the grounds they ’ re not related to a clear legislative purpose . Democratic leaders have been wary of moving ahead , concerned that impeachment could backfire and help Trump win re-election next year .

impeachment,National Review,2,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/12/the-articles-of-impeachment-are-very-weak/,The Articles of Impeachment Are Very Weak,2019-12-11,"Andrew C. Mccarthy, Kyle Smith, Kathryn Jean Lopez, Victor Davis Hanson, Kevin D. Williamson, Katherine Timpf, Zachary Evans, David Harsanyi, Jim Geraghty, Jonah Goldberg","The committee room where the first public hearings in the impeachment inquiry against U.S. President Donald Trump are scheduled to take place in Washington , U.S. ( Joshua Roberts/Reuters )
Democrats rolled out two articles of impeachment against President Trump on Tuesday , alleging abuse of power and obstruction .
As noted over the weekend , I had to correct myself when writing that the impeachment inquiry that led to this point was a “ rush to judgment. ” The judgment was made long ago . The president has been Impeached Man Walking for “ The Resistance ” since before he took the oath of office . The House proceedings have been a matter of rushing the process until it catches up to a judgment of three years ’ standing .
The two impeachment articles were produced by the House Judiciary Committee , chaired by Jerry Nadler ( D. , N.Y. ) , cribbing from the report spearheaded by Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff ( D. , Calif. ) . The abuse-of-power allegation is confined to the Ukraine episode , a kerfuffle that emerged three months ago and was promptly magnified into a scandal . The claim of obstruction relates to the president ’ s refusal to cooperate with the partisan impeachment inquiry , the outcome of which was foreordained even as Democrats refused for weeks to conduct a vote endorsing it — for fear of antagonizing voters , which , of course , would not be a fear if there were an obvious , egregious impeachable offense .
It was the lack of an identifiable crime that settled Democrats on “ abuse of power , ” taking advantage of the fact that the Framers did not require a penal offense for impeachment . . . but ignoring the Framers ’ caution against an ambiguous standard that would invite politicized impeachments based on trifling misconduct . Here , Democrats say the abuse involves Trump ’ s converting of presidential power to his “ personal political benefit ” — recall the mantra of placing “ self above country , ” which was chanted throughout Monday ’ s farcical Judiciary Committee hearing ( an often catty partisan duel , mainly between staff attorneys , with no testimony from actual fact witnesses ) .
Trump ’ s abuse of power is said to have three components : The president ( a ) exploited his foreign-relations power to pressure a foreign nation to meddle in American domestic politics ; ( b ) undermined our democratic elections ; and ( c ) endangered national security . Each is problematic .
A . Pressuring a Foreign Power to Meddle in U.S . Politics
Democrats maintain that Trump pushed for Ukrainian investigations of the Bidens and Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 election solely for his personal political gain . Even accepting ( as I do ) that Trump ’ s main motivation on the Bidens was damage to a likely political foe , the argument is still flawed .
It ’ s not like the president was asking Ukraine to make up corruption evidence out of whole cloth — as Schiff disingenuously claimed in his “ parody ” performance of the Trump–Zelensky call . There is , for example , more reason to suspect Biden-family self-dealing in Ukraine ( among other places ) than there was to suspect a Trump cyberespionage conspiracy with Russia — which our government zealously investigated for years , complete with surveillance warrants , confidential informants , and a special counsel probe .
Furthermore , Trump ’ s request for Kyiv ’ s help in investigating Democratic collusion with Ukraine in the 2016 campaign is not , as the impeachment article implies , limited to the debunked theory that Ukraine , rather than Russia , hacked the DNC . There is also significant evidence of Ukrainian government officials ’ working with Democrats to harm Trump ’ s campaign . The fact that this election interference was not as “ systematic ” as Russia ’ s ( as Democrats and their media note-takers point out ) does not erase the fact that it was meddling . Furthermore , even the discredited theory that Trump mentioned to Zelensky is best understood as Trump ’ s effort to dispel suspicions that he colluded with Russia in 2016 , not an effort to get a leg up in the 2020 race .
The claims that Trump pressured Ukraine to interfere in our domestic politics and thus undermined our elections bump up against the stubborn fact that , in the end , nothing of consequence happened . Yes , Trump delayed defense aid and a coveted White House visit for Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky . Yet Kyiv got its aid and barely noticed any delay . Trump correctly points out that he did not pressure Zelensky in their July 25 conversation , Zelensky says he never felt any pressure , and Trump gave Zelensky an audience — albeit in New York City at the high-profile U.N. meeting , not yet at the White House .
With such sparse evidence of wrongdoing , Democrats try inflating it with three dubious claims .
Democrats insist that Trump transferred the aid only because he got caught — i.e. , the “ whistleblower ” complaint purportedly prompted Trump to abandon the scheme . But this is anything but clear . Trump had other reasons , besides pushing for investigations , to delay aid to one of the world ’ s most corrupt countries , and he was getting pushed by Russia hawks in the administration and on Capitol Hill to make the transfer .
It could be that his well-founded reservations about aid for Ukraine were overcome by persuasive arguments . It could be that the whistleblower complaint influenced him . It could be both . Or neither . Regardless , what matters is that he transferred the aid . The rationale for doing so is less important than the act . On that score , Schiff ’ s claim that merely delaying the $ 391 million is just as bad as denying it would have been is self-evidently absurd .
b. Trump Cared Only about an Announcement , Not an Investigation
Democrats further maintain that Trump did not care whether Ukraine actually conducted a Biden investigation as long as Zelensky announced one . This purportedly puts the lie to Trump ’ s claim that he was motivated by anti-corruption concerns .
This theory has become conventional wisdom . Republicans not only failed to rebut it ; at times , they tried to argue it as a point in Trump ’ s favor ( see , he didn ’ t mean Biden any real harm ! ) . Nonetheless , the theory misstates the evidence . Trump was not saying he didn ’ t care whether the corruption investigation happened ; he was saying he would not release the defense aid until Zelensky made the announcement of the investigation . Plainly , his calculation was that a public commitment would ensure that Zelensky would feel compelled to follow through with an investigation — hence Ambassador Gordon Sondland ’ s testimony that Trump wanted Zelensky “ in a public box . ”
In any event , Trump stood down , the defense aid was transferred , and no Ukrainian announcement was required . Again , much ado about nothing .
Third , and most speciously , Democrats claim that delaying the aid emboldened Russia — with some Democrats even suggesting that Trump ’ s delay may be responsible for Ukrainians ’ being killed in the thrumming border conflict .
In truth , the Ukrainians barely knew that there was an aid delay , and there is no evidence that the holdup caused matériel shortages on the battlefield ( aid is released to Ukraine in stages over years of time ) . Moreover , Democrats and their “ policy community ” allies refuse to come to terms with the fact that , for better or worse , the elected president makes foreign policy . If the president decides to revisit foreign-aid grants , that ’ s his call , even if Washington ’ s beloved , selfless , progressive — and unelected — policy professionals think doing so is harmful . Finally , while President Obama dithered as Russia seized Crimea in 2014 , his successor has increased the lethality of Ukrainian defense aid over what Obama provided . The Democrats ’ pearl-clutching over Ukraine — even as they accuse Trump of pearl-clutching over corruption — is something to behold .
Democrats allege not only that Trump was attempting to undermine the 2020 election by soliciting foreign interference , but that he remains a continuing threat to do so — the latter being their rationale for the supposed imperative of impeaching him now rather than letting the American people decide his fate in the election less than eleven months from now .
1 . Nothing Happened . . . and Biden Does Not Have Immunity
The flaws in this claim are obvious . As already recounted , Trump dropped the matter : Ukraine got its aid , Zelensky got a POTUS meeting , and no investigations ( or announcement thereof ) were required . Plus , the Democrats ’ claim hinges on such fictions as the assertion that Trump was asking Ukraine to fabricate a case against Biden .
Running for president does not give Joe Biden immunity from inquiry into colorable suspicions of corruption , even if , as a collateral political consequence , the inquiry could help Trump and hurt Biden . If “ high crimes and misdemeanors ” now includes factoring domestic politics into dubious foreign-policy decisions ( see , e.g. , Obama ’ s withdrawal of troops from Iraq ) , maybe , to save time , we should start impeaching presidents before they take office — because every one of them will surely be impeachable .
Even with the media cover they enjoy , the Democrats ’ audacity in lodging this claim of corrupting elections against Trump is remarkable . Each new Russia-gate revelation elucidates that the Obama administration , in collusion with foreign governments , used the executive branch ’ s investigative powers in the service of the Democrats ’ 2016 campaign . The Ukraine misadventure is amateur hour compared with the Trump-Russia investigation — to which Democrats reacted not by condemning interference in our elections but by demanding a special counsel to straitjacket Trump ’ s administration .
Finally , Democrats claim President Trump poses a continuing threat to facilitate foreign interference in elections due to what they portray as a pattern begun in 2016 . That ’ s when candidate Trump purportedly encouraged Russia to hack Hillary Clinton . The inanity of this suggestion has not stopped it from being investigated by the special-counsel staff that Robert Mueller stacked with partisan Democrats , nor from being repeated ad nauseam by Democrats , their media allies , and anti-Trump pundits .
It is a silly allegation , no matter who feigns serious concerns about it . Trump did not encourage Russia to hack former secretary of state Clinton . In a palpably tongue-in-cheek effort to call public attention to his opponent ’ s biggest political vulnerability — viz. , her astounding use of a non-government , non-secure email system for her sensitive ( often classified ) State Department correspondence , and her purging of over 30,000 emails that she falsely claimed were wholly unrelated to government business — Trump quipped that he hoped Russia found the missing Clinton emails because they would titillate the media .
Obviously , Trump was not calling for Russia to hack Clinton ’ s emails . He couldn ’ t have been . As everyone knew , the FBI had Clinton ’ s decommissioned servers , offline and under lock and key . Indeed , the Bureau strongly suspected that Clinton ’ s emails had long ago been hacked by hostile foreign actors , potentially including Russian intelligence services . Trump was not sending a signal to his purported Russian confederates ; he was campaigning . He was hammering Clinton over her recklessness and dishonesty , major election issues . Furthermore , the “ collusion ” narrative held that Putin was the master and Trump the puppet ; even in that fantasyland , Trump did not give orders to Russian intelligence ; he took them .
Nevertheless , Democrats insist that the president ( a ) was pushing Russia to meddle ; ( b ) has now pushed Ukraine to meddle ; and ( c ) has more recently pushed China to meddle , also by investigating the Bidens . This last stems from still more presidential bloviating : When criticized for calling Kyiv to investigate Joe Biden , Trump ( being Trump ) doubled down by encouraging Beijing to do so , too . It was a noxious remark — suspects are tortured in the Communist Chinese “ justice ” system , so an American president should never even joke about Chinese investigation of an American . Still , Trump was talking nonsense . It warrants criticism , but to take it seriously is just as nonsensical . China does not take orders from Trump , and it plainly has no incentive to probe suspicions of corrupt ties between the Bidens and . . . itself .
Just as frivolously , Democrats maintain that Trump ’ s “ abuse of power ” includes endangering American national security . Here is the theory : Our noble ( if pervasively corrupt ) ally Ukraine is in a border war with Russia , a hostile foreign power , so we supply defense aid to Kyiv so they can fight Moscow ’ s mercenaries over there , lest we have to fight the Russian army over here . Yes , Jerry Nadler would have us believe that Ukraine — its armed forces threaded with neo-Nazis and jihadists — is the only thing preventing Putin from laying waste to everything from the Upper West Side down to Greenwich Village .
This , from the same Democrats who yawned when Russia annexed Crimea , and when Obama denied Kyiv the lethal defense aid Trump has provided . This , from the same Democrats who swooned when Obama mocked Mitt Romney for observing that Russia remains our most worrisome geopolitical foe . This , from the same Democrats who cheered when Obama struck a deal , including cash ransom payments , to give Iran , the world ’ s leading state sponsor of anti-American terrorism , an industrial-strength nuclear program that , in the absence of meaningful monitoring , could be converted to a nuclear-arms program in nothing flat .
It is perfectly reasonable to contend that arming Ukraine against Russian aggression is in American interests — especially after prior U.S. administrations of both parties encouraged Ukraine to disarm on the loopy theory that post-Soviet Russia posed no threat . But the claim that Trump ’ s dealings with Ukraine have put our national security at risk is fatuous .
The second article of impeachment alleges that President Trump has obstructed Congress . That is , he has unilaterally decided what executive-branch information will be revealed to House investigators , directing relevant witnesses to withhold testimony and agencies to withhold documents .
Consequently , an episode at Monday ’ s House hearing is worth pondering .
Daniel Goldman , the Intelligence Committee ’ s top majority counsel and investigator , was being questioned by the Judiciary Committee ’ s ranking member , Doug Collins ( R. , Ga. ) . At issue was the majority ’ s decision , in composing its report , to issue telephone-records subpoenas and then publicize the resulting phone records of its political piñatas — Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani , journalist John Solomon , and Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes — as if they were engaged in a nefarious conspiracy . The phone-records exposition did not advance the case that Trump pressured Zelensky to meddle in U.S. elections ; it was a smear job .
Collins wanted to know , Who decided to do that ? Who made the call not only to issue the subpoena but to publicize the relevant names rather than refer to them anonymously , as would typically be done in intelligence reporting ( e.g. , Lawyer No . 1 , Journalist No . 1 , Congressman No . 1 ) ?
Goldman ’ s response ? Essentially : None of your business . He refused to answer the questions . That is , the Democrats ’ chief legal beagle told an elected member of the People ’ s House that he ( the lawyer ) had unilaterally determined he need not provide information if he had what he regarded as a worthy reason to protect the confidentiality of communications .
The story is worth rehearsing so you understand : The Democrats ’ position is that the president of the United States does not have the same right to decline House requests for information — based on legally recognized executive privilege and attorney-client privilege — as an unelected bureaucrat who obeisantly answered every question posed by his fellow Democrats .
Mind you , I am a believer in political resolution of inter-branch disputes between the political parties . Unlike many conservatives and Trump supporters , I ’ m not particularly impressed that some Trump-administration officials have offered to litigate privilege issues in court . After all , in other cases , the Trump administration tells the court that it should stay out of political-branch squabbles . To be sure , I don ’ t think it ’ s reasonable for the House to impeach under circumstances where the executive is willing to litigate privilege issues in court ; but I think it ’ s completely reasonable for the House to counter that the Constitution does not require the Article I branch to rely on the Article III branch to get compliance from the Article II branch . Theoretically , the House may tell the executive , “ If you don ’ t comply with our information demands , we ’ ll impeach you . ”
I also think it ’ s fine for the president to tell Congress to take a walk if it demands evidence protected by executive privilege or other legal confidentiality claims . These inter-branch battles are meant to be resolved by politics , not judges . As a practical matter , disputes get worked out . It would be rash to go to DEFCON 1 when other arm-twisting can work ; in the end , House members who seek impeachment over thin gruel and presidents who contemptuously flout legitimate congressional inquiries know the voters will punish them if they push unreasonable positions too far .
On the politics , the president is banking on the public ’ s conclusion that the Democrats are engaged in a partisan crusade to impeach him , and he ’ s not going to cooperate . That leaves it to Democrats to convince the public that they are engaged in a good-faith inquiry into a matter of grave executive malfeasance , which the president is impeding .
I don ’ t think we need a judge to figure this out . I do think it ’ s worth noting , though , that when Daniel Goldman told the committee he would not answer any questions that he did not wish to answer , no Democrat objected .
In impeachment , selective outrage is not a good look . I ’ m almost tempted to call it an abuse of power .","The committee room where the first public hearings in the impeachment inquiry against U.S. President Donald Trump are scheduled to take place in Washington, U.S. (Joshua Roberts/Reuters)

The charges range from insignificant to implausible to inane.

Democrats rolled out two articles of impeachment against President Trump on Tuesday, alleging abuse of power and obstruction.

As noted over the weekend, I had to correct myself when writing that the impeachment inquiry that led to this point was a “rush to judgment.” The judgment was made long ago. The president has been Impeached Man Walking for “The Resistance” since before he took the oath of office. The House proceedings have been a matter of rushing the process until it catches up to a judgment of three years’ standing.

The two impeachment articles were produced by the House Judiciary Committee, chaired by Jerry Nadler (D., N.Y.), cribbing from the report spearheaded by Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff (D., Calif.). The abuse-of-power allegation is confined to the Ukraine episode, a kerfuffle that emerged three months ago and was promptly magnified into a scandal. The claim of obstruction relates to the president’s refusal to cooperate with the partisan impeachment inquiry, the outcome of which was foreordained even as Democrats refused for weeks to conduct a vote endorsing it — for fear of antagonizing voters, which, of course, would not be a fear if there were an obvious, egregious impeachable offense.

It was the lack of an identifiable crime that settled Democrats on “abuse of power,” taking advantage of the fact that the Framers did not require a penal offense for impeachment . . . but ignoring the Framers’ caution against an ambiguous standard that would invite politicized impeachments based on trifling misconduct. Here, Democrats say the abuse involves Trump’s converting of presidential power to his “personal political benefit” — recall the mantra of placing “self above country,” which was chanted throughout Monday’s farcical Judiciary Committee hearing (an often catty partisan duel, mainly between staff attorneys, with no testimony from actual fact witnesses).

ABUSE OF POWER

Trump’s abuse of power is said to have three components: The president (a) exploited his foreign-relations power to pressure a foreign nation to meddle in American domestic politics; (b) undermined our democratic elections; and (c) endangered national security. Each is problematic.

A. Pressuring a Foreign Power to Meddle in U.S. Politics

Democrats maintain that Trump pushed for Ukrainian investigations of the Bidens and Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 election solely for his personal political gain. Even accepting (as I do) that Trump’s main motivation on the Bidens was damage to a likely political foe, the argument is still flawed.

1. There Were (and Are) Legitimate Grounds for Investigations

It’s not like the president was asking Ukraine to make up corruption evidence out of whole cloth — as Schiff disingenuously claimed in his “parody” performance of the Trump–Zelensky call. There is, for example, more reason to suspect Biden-family self-dealing in Ukraine (among other places) than there was to suspect a Trump cyberespionage conspiracy with Russia — which our government zealously investigated for years, complete with surveillance warrants, confidential informants, and a special counsel probe.

The Ukraine misadventure is amateur hour compared with the Trump-Russia investigation — to which Democrats reacted not by condemning interference in our elections but by demanding a special counsel to straitjacket Trump’s administration.

( AP ) — President Donald Trump mocked the Democratic impeachment effort as he sought to rally supporters Tuesday in the key swing state of Pennsylvania , calling the process “ impeachment lite ” and promising it would lead to his reelection in 2020 .
Trump ’ s visit to Pennsylvania followed a momentous day at the U.S. Capitol , where Democrats unveiled articles of impeachment and shortly thereafter signaled their support for the president ’ s long-sought United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement . House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her fellow Democrats are trying to show they can pass legislation and pursue an impeachment inquiry at the same time , but Trump said , “ It plays down the impeachment because they ’ re embarrassed by the impeachment . ”
He insisted , “ And our poll numbers have gone through the roof because of her stupid impeachment . ”
And he added : “ The silver lining of impeachment and this witch hunt : That ’ s the reason they approved USMCA . So that ’ s OK with me . ”
Trump listed some of his achievements while in office , ticking off the killing of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi , a deal to create the Space Force and a strong economy .
Echoing a line he uses often , Trump said : “ This country is so respected . And we were not respected four years ago . We were laughed at . ”
Trump ’ s comments came less than a week after he made an early departure from a NATO meeting in London following the release of video of a handful of world leaders gossiping about him .
In 2016 , Trump eked out a win in Pennsylvania — the first Republican presidential candidate to capture it since 1988 — by piling up support in Pennsylvania ’ s rural areas and with working-class whites .
The president won the state and its 20 electoral votes by about 44,000 votes , and Pennsylvania promises to be among a handful of states that the presidential candidates will heavily target in a bid to get to 270 electoral votes .
As most of the Democratic candidates focus on Iowa , New Hampshire and other early voting states , the president has tried to make the most of uncontested access to top general election swing states such as Pennsylvania , Michigan and Wisconsin .
House Democrats unveiled two articles of impeachment Tuesday : abuse of power and obstruction of Congress .
Democratic leaders say Trump put U.S. elections and national security at risk when he asked Ukraine to investigate his political rival , former Vice President Joe Biden , who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination . And they say Trump impeded Congress ’ investigation of the matter .
If the House does vote to impeach Trump , the case moves to the Senate , where a vote to convict requires a two-thirds vote . With Republicans holding 53 of 100 seats , it is unlikely that Republican senators would cross party lines and vote to remove Trump from office .

“ A regular president would be under the table , thumb in mouth , saying : ‘ Take me home , Mommy . This is enough for me . ’ ”","HERSHEY, Pa. (AP) — President Donald Trump mocked the Democratic impeachment effort as he sought to rally supporters Tuesday in the key swing state of Pennsylvania, calling the process “impeachment lite” and promising it would lead to his reelection in 2020.

Trump’s visit to Pennsylvania followed a momentous day at the U.S. Capitol, where Democrats unveiled articles of impeachment and shortly thereafter signaled their support for the president’s long-sought United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her fellow Democrats are trying to show they can pass legislation and pursue an impeachment inquiry at the same time, but Trump said, “It plays down the impeachment because they’re embarrassed by the impeachment.”

He insisted, “And our poll numbers have gone through the roof because of her stupid impeachment.”

And he added: “The silver lining of impeachment and this witch hunt: That’s the reason they approved USMCA. So that’s OK with me.”

Trump listed some of his achievements while in office, ticking off the killing of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, a deal to create the Space Force and a strong economy.

Echoing a line he uses often, Trump said: “This country is so respected. And we were not respected four years ago. We were laughed at.”

Trump’s comments came less than a week after he made an early departure from a NATO meeting in London following the release of video of a handful of world leaders gossiping about him.

In 2016, Trump eked out a win in Pennsylvania — the first Republican presidential candidate to capture it since 1988 — by piling up support in Pennsylvania’s rural areas and with working-class whites.

The president won the state and its 20 electoral votes by about 44,000 votes, and Pennsylvania promises to be among a handful of states that the presidential candidates will heavily target in a bid to get to 270 electoral votes.

As most of the Democratic candidates focus on Iowa, New Hampshire and other early voting states, the president has tried to make the most of uncontested access to top general election swing states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.

House Democrats unveiled two articles of impeachment Tuesday: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.

Democratic leaders say Trump put U.S. elections and national security at risk when he asked Ukraine to investigate his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination. And they say Trump impeded Congress’ investigation of the matter.

If the House does vote to impeach Trump, the case moves to the Senate, where a vote to convict requires a two-thirds vote. With Republicans holding 53 of 100 seats, it is unlikely that Republican senators would cross party lines and vote to remove Trump from office.

During the rally, Trump also addressed the long-awaited release of the Justice Department report into the 2016 Russia investigation. The inspector general found that the FBI was justified in opening its investigation into ties between the Trump presidential campaign and Russia and that the FBI did not act with political bias, despite “serious performance failures” up the bureau’s chain of command.

Trump claimed Tuesday that the inspector general’s report detailed “outrageous, scandalous and unprecedented abuses of power.” He said FBI agents had “destroyed the lives of people that are great people” and called them “scum.”

He said he was looking forward to a report coming from John Durham, the prosecutor whom Attorney General William Barr has selected to investigate how intelligence was gathered in the Russia probe.

Trump said Tuesday that not many leaders could withstand what he’s been through.

What’s happening

Ever since the House of Representatives voted to impeach President Trump last month, a key point of contention has been whether the impending Senate trial would include witness testimony.

Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he prefers a swift trial with no new witnesses. Democrats in the Senate want to hear from administration officials at the center of Trump’s interactions with Ukraine, including acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton. On Monday, Bolton said he’d be willing to testify if subpoenaed by the Senate.

All procedural rules for the trial are decided by a majority vote. With 53 Republicans in the Senate, only a handful of GOP senators would need to break party ranks to force McConnell to call witnesses. So far, Mitt Romney is the only Senate Republican to publicly call for testimony.

On Tuesday, McConnell said he has the 51-vote majority needed to start the impeachment trial but would postpone a decision on whether to call witnesses.

Why there’s debate

Democrats have accused McConnell of trying to rush through a rigged trial without properly investigating allegations that Trump abused his power by withholding military aid from Ukraine. “A trial without all the facts is a farce,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said. The public would be denied the opportunity to fully judge the president's actions without hearing from the people closest to him, Democrats have argued. Bolton’s willingness to testify means Republicans have “run out of excuses” for refusing to call witnesses, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said.

McConnell and many Republicans say they’re under no obligation to call witnesses, given that the Senate trial will almost certainly end in an acquittal that allows Trump to remain in office. They argue that Democrats had the chance to pursue testimony from anyone they wanted when they controlled proceedings in the House, but chose not to pursue legal channels that could have compelled reluctant administration officials to appear.

The president has reportedly advocated for a made-for-TV spectacle of a trial, with witness testimony from those he sees as political enemies — like Joe Biden and Adam Schiff, who led the House impeachment inquiry. Trump has recently shifted his thinking on the matter, according to reports.

What’s next

Nancy Pelosi announced on Friday that she plans to send the articles of impeachment to the Senate next week. Once the articles have been received, McConnell can start the trial — with the question of witnesses still unanswered — as soon as he likes.

In a letter signed by House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff ( D-CA ) , House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Eliot Engel ( D-NY ) , and House Oversight Committee Chair Elijah Cummings ( D-MD ) , and posted on the House Oversight Committee ’ s official website Monday , Giuliani is ordered to produce information by Oct. 15 related the Democrats ’ Ukraine investigation .

“ Our inquiry includes an investigation of credible allegations that you acted as an agent of the President in a scheme to advance his personal political interests by abusing the power of the Office of the President . A growing public record , including your own statements , indicate that the President , you , and others appear to have pressed the Ukrainian government to pursue two politically -motivated investigations .

During an interview on CNN , Chris Cuomo asked you , ‘ Sir , you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden ? ’ You responded , ‘ Of course I did. ’ In addition to this stark admission , you stated more recently that you are in possession of evidence—in the form of text messages , phone records , and other communications—indicating that you were not acting along and that other Trump Administration officials may have been involved in this scheme . The subpoena requires you to produce all of those communications , and other related documents , to the Commmittees in order to determine the full extent of this effort by the President and his Administration to press Ukraine to interfere in our 2020 presidential election . ”
The letter concludes by ordering Giuliani to contact staff for the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence “ to arrange for the production of documents . ”
Though Democrats are accusing Trump of trying to “ cover up ” his July 25 call to his Ukrainian counterpart , which Trump has repeatedly defended as a “ perfect ” call , Trump authorized release of the transcript of the call last week . In the call , Trump asked Zelensky to “ look into ” the alleged corruption scandal involving the Ukraine-based company Burisma Holdings that hired Hunter Biden just weeks after his father was appointed by then-President Barack Obama to oversee Ukraine-U.S. relations . Biden eventually used the threat of withholding $ 1 billion in aid to Ukraine to force the removal of the country ’ s top prosecutor , who had been investigating Burisma for alleged corruption .
“ I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down , and that ’ s really unfair , ” Trump told Zelensky , according to the transcript of the call . “ A lot of people are talking about that , the way they shut your very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad people involved . Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man . He was the mayor of New York City , a great mayor , and I would like him to call you . I will ask him to call you along with the Attorney General . Rudy very much knows what ’ s happening and he is a very capable guy . If you could speak to him that would be great . The former ambassador from the United States , the woman , was bad news so I just want to let you know that . The other thing , There ’ s a lot of talk about Biden ’ s son , that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great . Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution , so if you can look into it … It sounds horrible to me . ”

The letter concludes by ordering Giuliani to contact staff for the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence “to arrange for the production of documents.”

Though Democrats are accusing Trump of trying to “cover up” his July 25 call to his Ukrainian counterpart, which Trump has repeatedly defended as a “perfect” call, Trump authorized release of the transcript of the call last week. In the call, Trump asked Zelensky to “look into” the alleged corruption scandal involving the Ukraine-based company Burisma Holdings that hired Hunter Biden just weeks after his father was appointed by then-President Barack Obama to oversee Ukraine-U.S. relations. Biden eventually used the threat of withholding $1 billion in aid to Ukraine to force the removal of the country’s top prosecutor, who had been investigating Burisma for alleged corruption.

“I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down, and that’s really unfair,” Trump told Zelensky, according to the transcript of the call. “A lot of people are talking about that, the way they shut your very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad people involved. Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man. He was the mayor of New York City, a great mayor, and I would like him to call you. I will ask him to call you along with the Attorney General. Rudy very much knows what’s happening and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him that would be great. The former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news so I just want to let you know that. The other thing, There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution, so if you can look into it … It sounds horrible to me.”

Democrats accused the president of endangering the U.S. Constitution, jeopardizing national security and undermining the integrity of the 2020 election by asking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a July phone call to investigate Biden, a former U.S. vice president, as well as his son Hunter Biden.

Jim Jordan ( R-Ohio ) a boost by pushing him for a top committee spot . | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo Congress Republicans battle to defend Trump from threat of impeachment Lawmakers are jockeying for the top GOP spot on the House Judiciary Committee , which will be ground zero for Democratic attacks on the president .
The audition to become President Donald Trump 's most visible defender in Congress — and lead the fight against any impeachment proceedings — is in full swing .
One of Trump ’ s fiercest allies , Rep. Jim Jordan , on Friday began flirting openly with a bid to serve as the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee , the panel where a flood of Democratic-led investigations , and potential impeachment , will begin .
`` We ’ re still looking at it , '' the Ohio Republican said when asked whether he would run for the post . `` I ’ ve always been one who ’ s going to fight to get the truth out no matter what role I have . So we ’ ll just wait and see . ''
Republicans ' pick will be critical for Trump and his party . The new House Democratic majority has detailed a long list of targets for investigation , from Trump ’ s business entanglements to his decision to fire former FBI Director James Comey . Even after Republicans were routed in the midterms , GOP leaders are vowing to aggressively defend against Democratic probes , which they 've labeled `` presidential harassment . ''
The top slot on the Judiciary Committee also comes with a powerful policy portfolio . The committee has jurisdiction over immigration , gun control and abortion , as well as oversight of the Justice Department and FBI . But with Capitol Hill polarized over the president , the next ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee will likely be spending more time fighting for Trump than legislating with Democrats . It ’ s a reality that is already coloring the jockeying for the job .

Trump , in fact , has already given Jordan a boost — calling incoming GOP leader Kevin McCarthy and urging him to ensure Jordan , a longtime McCarthy adversary , got a top committee post next year . That led to whispers and speculation that Trump wanted Jordan in the Judiciary slot , though Trump has declined to explicitly endorse him .
`` I would like to see Jim in a high position ’ cause he deserves it , '' Trump told the Daily Caller on Wednesday . `` He ’ s fantastic , but I haven ’ t gotten into the endorsement or not . ''
Jordan 's interest in the role has scrambled the calculus for the other GOP lawmakers eyeing the job , including Rep. Doug Collins , who 's widely perceived as the front-runner .
Collins has spent a year maneuvering meticulously to become the lead Republican on the committee . The affable Georgian has crisscrossed the country fundraising for colleagues , forged relationships with Republicans in House leadership and showcased his legislative chops by partnering with Democrats to advance high-profile legislation .
But since Election Day , when rumors of Jordan 's interest in the position began to surface , Collins has taken pains to emphasize all the ways he ’ s backed up Trump in investigations and on the House floor over the last two years .
Collins ' allies note that he has taken on the Justice Department over GOP allegations that senior officials were biased against Trump — an issue Jordan has championed for a year . And Collins himself says that even as he considers ways to collaborate with Democrats , he 'll relish the chance to beat back any `` overreach '' in their investigations of the president .
`` I can fight as hard as anyone on this stuff , '' he said in an interview .
And as for Jordan 's reputation as a pro-Trump street fighter , Collins said he 's better equipped to be a strategic defender of the president . He 's been on the Rules Committee , he noted , which gives him expertise on potential tactics to fight Democratic probes .
`` You don ’ t always have to be the loudest voice in the room , '' he said . `` You just have to be the smartest voice in the room . ''
Jordan would likely face an uphill climb to win the post — even if he got an explicit push from Trump . That 's because the coveted slot is awarded by the leadership-dominated GOP Steering Committee , which will meet later this month to nominate committee leaders .
The committee 's recommendations are also ratified by the full House GOP . Jordan , vice chairman of the conservative Freedom Caucus , has alienated elements of the Republican Conference with hard-line tactics over the years . His opposition to McCarthy 's 2015 bid to become speaker helped doom the California Republican 's chances .
But Jordan 's looming presence appears to have shifted the Judiciary Committee race .
Collins is working double-time to emphasize his track record of support for Trump 's priorities . The day after Democrats won the majority , Collins ' first statement was an attack on incoming Chairman Jerry Nadler ( D-N.Y. ) .
`` Our counterparts across the aisle are giddy about running roughshod over process and weaponizing taxpayer resources against President Trump , the Commander in Chief Americans elected , '' he wrote . `` We 're here to remind Mr. Nadler that a House majority does n't give liberals license to chase political vendettas . ''
The tone was notable for Collins , who — despite often sparring with Democrats on the House floor — had spent much of the year highlighting his outreach across the aisle on a bill to modernize copyright laws for the music industry and , more recently , forge a hard-won deal on prison reform legislation . Trump himself embraced the bill last week and highlighted it at a White House press conference with Collins standing at his right shoulder .
It was the second time Collins was at the White House for a legislative event this year . He stood alongside the president for the signing of the bipartisan Music Modernization Act .
Despite his harsh words for Nadler , Collins said he and the liberal New Yorker get along .
`` We do have a good relationship in the sense that we can talk , '' he said . Collins added that he sees potential for bipartisan cooperation on issues like intellectual property , criminal justice reform and privacy rights .
Though Collins appears to have an inside track for the post , he also must overcome a bid by a more senior GOP lawmaker , Rep. Steve Chabot of Ohio , who has been touting his more than two decades of time on the committee in a pitch to colleagues .
Chabot is one of two remaining House members who helped manage the GOP impeachment of President Bill Clinton , experience he said would be invaluable if Democrats try to impeach Trump in the next Congress .

Scott Applewhite/AP Photo Congress Republicans battle to defend Trump from threat of impeachment Lawmakers are jockeying for the top GOP spot on the House Judiciary Committee, which will be ground zero for Democratic attacks on the president.

The audition to become President Donald Trump's most visible defender in Congress — and lead the fight against any impeachment proceedings — is in full swing.

One of Trump’s fiercest allies, Rep. Jim Jordan, on Friday began flirting openly with a bid to serve as the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, the panel where a flood of Democratic-led investigations, and potential impeachment, will begin.

Story Continued Below

""We’re still looking at it,"" the Ohio Republican said when asked whether he would run for the post. ""I’ve always been one who’s going to fight to get the truth out no matter what role I have. So we’ll just wait and see.""

Republicans' pick will be critical for Trump and his party. The new House Democratic majority has detailed a long list of targets for investigation, from Trump’s business entanglements to his decision to fire former FBI Director James Comey. Even after Republicans were routed in the midterms, GOP leaders are vowing to aggressively defend against Democratic probes, which they've labeled ""presidential harassment.""

The top slot on the Judiciary Committee also comes with a powerful policy portfolio. The committee has jurisdiction over immigration, gun control and abortion, as well as oversight of the Justice Department and FBI. But with Capitol Hill polarized over the president, the next ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee will likely be spending more time fighting for Trump than legislating with Democrats. It’s a reality that is already coloring the jockeying for the job.

Trump, in fact, has already given Jordan a boost — calling incoming GOP leader Kevin McCarthy and urging him to ensure Jordan, a longtime McCarthy adversary, got a top committee post next year. That led to whispers and speculation that Trump wanted Jordan in the Judiciary slot, though Trump has declined to explicitly endorse him.

""I would like to see Jim in a high position ’cause he deserves it,"" Trump told the Daily Caller on Wednesday. ""He’s fantastic, but I haven’t gotten into the endorsement or not.""

Jordan's interest in the role has scrambled the calculus for the other GOP lawmakers eyeing the job, including Rep. Doug Collins, who's widely perceived as the front-runner.

Collins has spent a year maneuvering meticulously to become the lead Republican on the committee. The affable Georgian has crisscrossed the country fundraising for colleagues, forged relationships with Republicans in House leadership and showcased his legislative chops by partnering with Democrats to advance high-profile legislation.

But since Election Day, when rumors of Jordan's interest in the position began to surface, Collins has taken pains to emphasize all the ways he’s backed up Trump in investigations and on the House floor over the last two years.

Collins' allies note that he has taken on the Justice Department over GOP allegations that senior officials were biased against Trump — an issue Jordan has championed for a year. And Collins himself says that even as he considers ways to collaborate with Democrats, he'll relish the chance to beat back any ""overreach"" in their investigations of the president.

""I can fight as hard as anyone on this stuff,"" he said in an interview.

And as for Jordan's reputation as a pro-Trump street fighter, Collins said he's better equipped to be a strategic defender of the president. He's been on the Rules Committee, he noted, which gives him expertise on potential tactics to fight Democratic probes.

""You don’t always have to be the loudest voice in the room,"" he said. ""You just have to be the smartest voice in the room.""

Jordan would likely face an uphill climb to win the post — even if he got an explicit push from Trump. That's because the coveted slot is awarded by the leadership-dominated GOP Steering Committee, which will meet later this month to nominate committee leaders.

The committee's recommendations are also ratified by the full House GOP. Jordan, vice chairman of the conservative Freedom Caucus, has alienated elements of the Republican Conference with hard-line tactics over the years. His opposition to McCarthy's 2015 bid to become speaker helped doom the California Republican's chances.

But Jordan's looming presence appears to have shifted the Judiciary Committee race.

Collins is working double-time to emphasize his track record of support for Trump's priorities. The day after Democrats won the majority, Collins' first statement was an attack on incoming Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.).

""Our counterparts across the aisle are giddy about running roughshod over process and weaponizing taxpayer resources against President Trump, the Commander in Chief Americans elected,"" he wrote. ""We're here to remind Mr. Nadler that a House majority doesn't give liberals license to chase political vendettas.""

The tone was notable for Collins, who — despite often sparring with Democrats on the House floor — had spent much of the year highlighting his outreach across the aisle on a bill to modernize copyright laws for the music industry and, more recently, forge a hard-won deal on prison reform legislation. Trump himself embraced the bill last week and highlighted it at a White House press conference with Collins standing at his right shoulder.

It was the second time Collins was at the White House for a legislative event this year. He stood alongside the president for the signing of the bipartisan Music Modernization Act.

Despite his harsh words for Nadler, Collins said he and the liberal New Yorker get along.

""We do have a good relationship in the sense that we can talk,"" he said. Collins added that he sees potential for bipartisan cooperation on issues like intellectual property, criminal justice reform and privacy rights.

Though Collins appears to have an inside track for the post, he also must overcome a bid by a more senior GOP lawmaker, Rep. Steve Chabot of Ohio, who has been touting his more than two decades of time on the committee in a pitch to colleagues.

Chabot is one of two remaining House members who helped manage the GOP impeachment of President Bill Clinton, experience he said would be invaluable if Democrats try to impeach Trump in the next Congress.

In a phone interview, Chabot noted that he's the dean of the Ohio delegation — the one from which Jordan also hails — and has worked to support Republicans in the pivotal swing state. He's also got a long track record of legislating, noting that he helped pass abortion restrictions and victims rights legislation and oversaw hearings on reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act. And he noted that he has known Nadler, and served on the committee with him, for decades.

Despite Collins' relationships, Chabot said he's been talking with members of the GOP Steering Committee ""off and on for three or four months"" and says his chances to win the post are ""excellent.""

Chabot, too, noted Jordan's potential entry into the contest. He said he likes Jordan and that they generally vote the same way on legislation. ""Didn't Nancy Pelosi say, 'Come on in, the water's warm?'"" Chabot joked, referencing the Democratic leader's comments welcoming a potential challenge to her position.

""If we have a dozen people who jump in,"" he said, ""I would stack my credentials and my bona fides against anybody else.""

Democrats are warily eyeing the emerging contest to determine who Nadler may be squaring off against next year.

WASHINGTON ( AP ) — The House Judiciary Committee held open the possibility Monday of recommending additional articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump as it pressed anew for the testimony of former White House counsel Don McGahn .

WASHINGTON (AP) — The House Judiciary Committee held open the possibility Monday of recommending additional articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump as it pressed anew for the testimony of former White House counsel Don McGahn.

The committee wants a federal appeals court to order McGahn to testify as it examines potential obstruction of justice by the president during special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. The committee says McGahn’s testimony could also be useful for any Senate impeachment trial.

Bush in 2018 featured a who 's who of U.S. political heavyweights .
The nation 's four living former presidents and their wives were in the first row of the National Cathedral in Washington , D.C. Alongside were President Donald Trump and his wife . Bush 's eldest son , former president George W. Bush , sat nearby with his wife and extended family .
Among the mourners was the man once known to millions as America 's Mayor and now Trump 's personal lawyer : Rudy Giuliani . He was accompanied by — who ?
The chubby man in the dark suit was Lev Parnas , a Soviet-born businessman known to few at the time . Now , the 47-year-old Florida resident is famed as Giuliani 's associate in pressing for an investigation that could discredit former Vice President Joe Biden , a Trump rival in the 2020 presidential race , by digging up dirt in Parnas ' native Ukraine .
Parnas ' relationship with Giuliani was n't all business . He 'd honored Giuliani by naming him godfather of his young son . Just a few weeks before the final farewell for the nation 's 41st president , Giuliani invited Parnas to join him at Shelly 's Back Room , a clubby Washington retreat for cigar and whiskey aficionados .
`` Sounds good I 'll meet you there , '' Parnas answered via text . He said he 'd bring Rep. Pete Sessions , a Texas Republican and longtime Giuliani ally who had just lost his seat in the midterm elections .
Parnas ' uninvited attendance at the funeral illustrated the meteoric rise and curious position of a man who played Sancho Panza to Giuliani 's Don Quixote , a status enabled in part by large contributions to Republican politicians and Trump-related campaign committees .
Lev Parnas , in a WhatsApp message to a major GOP donor I 'm officially part of team trump
Parnas is no longer cigar buddies with America 's Mayor . Instead , he 's dishing about his work with Giuliani in Ukraine and providing reams of messages and documents to House impeachment investigators .
He says the evidence shows Trump approved of his work to pressure Ukraine to investigate Biden . House investigators agree . They 've sent it to the Senate for potential consideration in Trump 's impeachment trial , currently underway in the Senate .
While Parnas has described his turnabout and prime-time TV interviews as patriotic truth-telling , he 's also angling for leniency in a campaign finance case brought against him by federal prosecutors in New York .
Parnas ' journey to a state funeral and Manhattan federal court started with his family 's emigration from Odessa , Ukraine , to the U.S. when he was three years old .
Now a naturalized U.S. citizen , he grew up in Brooklyn , home to many immigrants from Eastern Europe .
Over the years he sold condos and closed deals . He signed up and fell out with business partners . He started new ventures and watched them fold . He was evicted and sued . He was a doting father described by some as a con man .
By March 2019 , jetting around the world with Giuliani , he seemed to have reached a milestone . `` I 'm officially part of team trump , '' he wrote in a WhatsApp message to Harry Sargeant III , a wealthy Florida energy mogul and GOP donor .
That may have been true until last week , when House impeachment investigators disclosed the trove of material Parnas turned over .
They contend the evidence bolsters their case that Trump should be removed from office for his role in a scheme to withhold nearly $ 400 million in U.S. military aid from Ukraine unless government officials there investigated Biden 's family .
Giuliani associate Lev Parnas claims Trump knew about Ukraine Rudy Giuliani 's associate Lev Parnas said President Trump `` knew exactly what was going on '' in Ukraine . ███
`` President Trump knew exactly what was going on , '' Parnas told MSNBC 's Rachel Maddow .
His story , told through impeachment investigation records , court filings and other records and interviews , shows how someone with campaign cash – or the promise of it – managed to become part of Trump 's orbit despite some unwelcome baggage . Parnas ' attorney , Joseph Bondy , did not respond to an interview request .
`` I went from being a top donor , from being at all the events where we would just socialize , to becoming a close friend of Rudy Giuliani 's , to eventually becoming his ally and his asset on the ground in Ukraine , '' Parnas told CNN 's Anderson Cooper .
Parnas said his first connection with the Trump family came early in his career , selling Brooklyn apartments for Fred Trump , the president 's father . Records of his addresses from the mid-1990s link him to a real estate company not far from the elder Trump 's office .
By 1997 , Parnas was living in Boca Raton , Florida , where he registered to vote as a Republican . Two years later , he got a license to carry a concealed weapon .
Parnas was a broker for three companies that were expelled by a Wall Street association that self-regulates financial brokerages and brokers . He was not personally implicated in any of the alleged wrongdoing .
By the mid-2000s , Parnas had moved on to Edgetech International , a penny-stock company registered in Nevada . Serving as CEO , he ran the company from a Florida office and marketed an early mobile internet device known as the PC Edge . The company ultimately folded .
Lev Parnas arrives at federal court in New York City , where he is charged with violating federal campaign finance laws , on Dec. 2 , 2019 . Seth Wenig , AP
`` Sometimes we were buying Rolexes , '' he told The Washington Post . `` And sometimes we were selling the Rolexes to make the rent . ''
And then there were the times he did n't make the rent . The owner of an apartment complex in Boca Raton repeatedly sued him for failing to pay . A law firm in Hollywood , Florida , sued him in 2012 to collect nearly $ 27,000 in legal bills for battling eviction from another property .
In November 2010 , Parnas met with Michael Pues , the New Jersey owner of a stone industry company , at the Millennium Hotel in New York City . At the time , Parnas was Pues ' investment broker .
Pues had signed up after Parnas touted himself as `` the youngest stockbroker out there , '' someone who was `` driving around in a Bentley '' and never lost money for his clients , according to a court filing .
In late 2010 , Parnas asked Pues to invest in a movie called `` Anatomy of an Assassin . '' Parnas introduced Pues to Rudy Durand , a Hollywood writer and producer . Durand and actor Jack Nicholson met with Pues in Manhattan 's swank Carlyle Hotel to discuss the project , the court filing shows .
Michael Pues , who is pursuing Parnas for a loan he never paid I trusted him with everything . He used to call me family .
Pues said he was impressed . He agreed to provide a short-term , $ 350,000 loan from his family 's trust . He has n't been repaid , despite years chasing Parnas in court .
A federal judge in Brooklyn issued a $ 350,000 judgment against Parnas and his Parnas Holdings company in late 2015 . With interest , the debt has soared to more than $ 678,000 .
Pues testified that Parnas agreed verbally to return the money after 45 days . But after making the loan , he said he was unable to reach Parnas again .
Instead , a Parnas associate responded by saying the company could n't repay . Pues said he felt conned by the man he once trusted .
`` I trusted him with everything . He used to call me family , '' he said in a court hearing .
Durand , who appeared in court as a witness for the Pues family trust , testified `` that at one time he liked and trusted Lev , but that he later found him to be a con artist , '' according to the judgment .
Despite the debts , Parnas still had access to funds . In October 2016 , the closing stretch of the presidential election , he provided financial backing for the son of the man who gave him one of his first jobs .
On the same day that month , Parnas contributed $ 50,000 to the Trump Victory political action committee and $ 2,700 to the Donald J. Trump for President campaign committee , the maximum allowed for the general election .
He had n't donated to federal campaigns before , elections records show . `` I never was in politics , '' he told CNN . `` I was just a businessman trying to get by . ''
The PAC contribution listed Parnas ' employer as Fraud Guarantee , a company he created in part to ensure that Google searches of his name would produce positive results , rather than surface prior allegations of fraud , The Wall Street Journal reported .
Parnas ' company , which offered products and services to guard against investment fraud , had no sign of any customers at the time of the contributions . However , it later received a $ 1.5 million investment from Magnolia Ventures , a New York City-based venture capital fund .
This Facebook screen shot provided by The Campaign Legal Center , shows President Donald Trump standing with Lev Parnas , top left photo , at the White House in Washington , posted on May 1 , 2018 . AP
Parnas ' donations gave him a seed of credibility among Trump allies . Shortly after Trump took office in January 2017 , Parnas tried to advance his business prospects .
He contacted Michael Cohen , who at the time was Trump 's personal lawyer and longtime problem fixer , and asked for a meeting with the president , according to a person with knowledge of the matter .
Parnas wanted to discuss a proposal to prevent fraud and waste in government , the person said . It 's unclear whether such a meeting took place , though Parnas told CNN he met Cohen a couple of times .
Cohen is serving a three-year prison sentence for evading taxes , lying to Congress and banks , and arranging secret payments to buy the silence of two women who said they had sexual affairs with Trump years before he was elected . Trump has denied the claims .

By 2018 , Parnas ' donations started to pay off in the form of invitations to Trump fundraisers and other events .
In May 2018 , Parnas posted a photo to Facebook . He and Igor Fruman , a Belarus-born business associate and future co-defendant , were sitting at a table with Donald Trump Jr. and Tommy Hicks Jr. , a wealthy Trump fundraiser from Texas .
On social media , Parnas posted photo after photo with GOP figures . Trump . Trump Jr. Hicks . And others that Parnas ' attorney has publicized recently in response to Trump allies ' efforts to disavow or discredit him . They include Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway and former White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders .
In May 2018 , Parnas and Fruman contributed $ 325,000 to America First Action , a pro-Trump super PAC .
That donation would eventually land them in federal court . Prosecutors accuse them of concealing the true source of the money , part of a scheme to win influence by funneling hundreds of thousands of dollars to U.S. election candidates and campaign committees .
But in the short term , the transaction apparently helped put Parnas in touch with Joseph Ahearn , the director of development for America First Policies , the PAC 's sibling nonprofit . Ahearn kept Donald Trump Jr. apprised of Ukraine-related issues .
On March 20 , Ahearn sent Parnas a WhatsApp message asking , `` What should I send Don to tweet ? '' according to documents Parnas ' lawyer provided to House impeachment investigators .
Parnas forwarded some news stories . `` Have jr retweet it , '' he said . Ahearn responded , `` Sent . ''
A few days later , Parnas sent Ahearn a link to a Daily Wire story headlined , `` Calls Grow To Remove Obama ’ s U.S . Ambassador To Ukraine . '' The same day , Trump Jr. tweeted the link .
Hicks , the wealthy Trump family loyalist who 's now the co-chair of the Republican National Committee , also exchanged messages with Parnas . He advised Parnas that the owner of The Daily Caller , a conservative news and opinion website , was a friend .
`` We should let him know what we know at the right time , '' he messaged Parnas , who responded `` 100 % . ''
Harry Sargeant III , in a WhatsApp message to Lev Parnas Just becoming expensive to fly you guys everywhere LEV
But even as Parnas corresponded and hobnobbed with political elites , he had to figure out how to pay for it all , and how to support his family .
Sargeant , the Florida businessman , funded some of Parnas ' travel as he jetted to Ukraine and elsewhere in Europe , documents released by House impeachment investigators show .
On April 10 , Parnas messaged Sargeant via WhatsApp after discovering that a trip to Vienna had been canceled .
`` Just becoming expensive to fly you guys everywhere LEV , '' Sargeant replied .
Sargeant 's attorney has said his client loaned the funds after Parnas said he was broke and pledged to repay it .
Parnas seemed eager to defuse the situation . “ We are never expecting you to pay for it my brother that ’ s why we wanted to do the loan so we don ’ t have to bother you , '' he told Sargeant .
At one point , Parnas asked Sargeant to call , dangling the prospect of `` juicy stuff . '' When Sargeant asked what it was , Parnas demurred . A week later , he told Sargeant , `` Working hard to save our country my brother ! ! ! ! ''
Giuliani told Reuters that Parnas ' Fraud Guarantee firm paid him $ 500,000 for legal and technical consulting work in 2018 . The money actually came from Charles Gucciardo , a Republican donor and Trump supporter from Long Island , The New York Times reported .
Gucciardo agreed to invest in Fraud Guarantee because it was a `` company that Rudolph Giuliani was going to be the spokesman and the face of , '' said Gucciardo 's attorney , Randy Zelin , according to the report .
That deal meant Giuliani was working for Parnas . Yet in a May 2019 tweet , he identified Parnas and Fruman as his legal clients .
Their relationship apparently strengthened as Giuliani realized Parnas ' language ability and Fruman 's contacts in Ukraine could help him investigate the financial dealings of Hunter Biden , the son of Joe Biden . The younger Biden had been a well-compensated board member of Burisma Holdings , a Ukraine energy company .
Giuliani has alleged that Joe Biden abused his office by urging the 2016 firing of Viktor Shokin , at the time Ukraine 's chief prosecutor , out of concern that Shokin might implicate Hunter Biden in a corruption investigation .
But Biden , officials in Ukraine and the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine have said many in the international community wanted Shokin gone because he did n't do enough to battle corruption .
Parnas seemed to be in constant communication with Trump allies and Ukrainian officials who might advance his efforts to implicate Biden in a scandal . `` I was the middleman between two worlds , '' Parnas told Cooper on CNN .

Parnas was Giuliani 's go-between with Yuriy Lutsenko , who until August was the chief prosecutor in Ukraine . In WhatsApp messages written in Russian , Lutsenko complained about U.S . Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch and pressed for her removal .
Giuliani wanted her out , too , apparently believing she could hinder his Ukraine investigation . He referred to her as a `` crooked Ambassador '' in a May text to Parnas that was included in the material turned over to House impeachment investigators .
As for Trump 's view , he apparently was recorded telling associates that he wanted Yovanovitch fired , ABC News reported on Friday . The purported remarks were made as Trump met with a small gathering that included Parnas and Fruman , the report said . If authenticated , the remarks could undercut Trump 's statements that he did not know the business associates
Yovanovitch has denied any wrongdoing and insisted she never criticized Trump or his administration , as some Trump supporters claim .
As the weeks of early 2019 dragged on and Yovanovitch remained in Kyiv , Parnas sought to reassure an increasingly irritated Lutsenko .
`` It 's just if you all do n't decide on the madame - you all question all my statements . Including the one on B , '' Lutsenko told Parnas on March 22 , a possible reference to Biden . Three days later , he complained : `` You ca n't remove one stupid woman from office . ''
`` She is not a simple stupid woman , believe me , '' Parnas responded . `` Well , she wo n't get away for long . ''
Dispatch from Ukraine : Trump 's conspiracy theories thrive in Ukraine , where a young democracy battles corruption and distrust
Around May 2018 , Parnas and Fruman met separately with Sessions , a Texas Republican and longtime Giuliani backer . They pledged to raise $ 20,000 for Sessions ' reelection , according to the criminal indictment against the Soviet-born partners .
Sessions wrote a May 9 , 2018 , letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claiming he had evidence Yovanovitch had disparaged Trump and asking for her removal . Sessions later said the letter was unrelated to Parnas and Fruman .
Sessions , who received a federal grand jury subpoena in the campaign finance case , has said he had no involvement in the alleged scheme .
Parnas sent Giuliani a copy of Sessions ' letter in December 2018 . Later that day , Parnas texted : `` Just spoke with Pete I 'll update you tomorrow . ''

In April 2019 , Giuliani texted Parnas an update that appeared to refer to either Pompeo or Trump : `` He fired her again . ''
`` I pray it happens this time I 'll call you tomorrow my brother , '' replied Parnas .
Pressed by Trump , the Department of State abruptly recalled Yovanovitch to Washington , D.C. , the next day .
After Trump 's July phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky , an unidentified whistleblower filed a complaint that ultimately triggered the impeachment proceedings against Trump .
The whistleblower complained that the president appeared to abuse his office with an improper quid pro quo : withholding congressionally-approved U.S. military aid for Ukraine while pressing Zelensky for an investigation of the Biden family .
Trump has denied the allegations , calling the phone call `` perfect '' and characterizing the impeachment proceedings as a hoax .
In October , three months after that complaint , Parnas and Fruman were arrested before they boarded a plane to Europe with one-way tickets . The indictment alleged that their scheme , carried out with help from an unidentified Ukrainian government official and funding from a Russian national , was aimed at buying `` potential influence with candidates , campaigns , and the candidates ' governments . ''
Then Giuliani learned that federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York , the office he once led and the one that charged Parnas and Fruman , were investigating his business dealings .
The day after Parnas and Fruman were arrested , House impeachment investigators issued subpoenas . The two initially said they would not cooperate . At the time , their attorney was John Dowd , a longtime Giuliani ally and former lawyer for Trump .
But Parnas changed lawyers and decided to cooperate . His disclosures to House investigators torpedoed his relationship with Giuliani .
Giuliani declared Tuesday he was `` heartbroken '' over the rupture . He told Fox News ' Laura Ingraham he would n't respond to all of Parnas ' accusations about their dealings , saying , `` He in very large part did not tell the truth . ''
Trump repeated an earlier denial that he did not know Parnas . In response , Bondy tweeted a video showing Parnas with his arm on Trump 's shoulder during a Mar-a-Lago event in Florida as he introduced the nation 's commander-in-chief to a Ukrainian government official .
No recent selfies of Parnas and GOP heavyweights have surfaced . Instead , his lawyer has posted photos of Parnas smiling with the TV journalists who interviewed him about his exploits .

Bondy ( @ josephabondy ) January 16 , 2020","The state funeral for former President George H.W. Bush in 2018 featured a who's who of U.S. political heavyweights.

The nation's four living former presidents and their wives were in the first row of the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. Alongside were President Donald Trump and his wife. Bush's eldest son, former president George W. Bush, sat nearby with his wife and extended family.

Among the mourners was the man once known to millions as America's Mayor and now Trump's personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani. He was accompanied by — who?

The chubby man in the dark suit was Lev Parnas, a Soviet-born businessman known to few at the time. Now, the 47-year-old Florida resident is famed as Giuliani's associate in pressing for an investigation that could discredit former Vice President Joe Biden, a Trump rival in the 2020 presidential race, by digging up dirt in Parnas' native Ukraine.

Parnas' relationship with Giuliani wasn't all business. He'd honored Giuliani by naming him godfather of his young son. Just a few weeks before the final farewell for the nation's 41st president, Giuliani invited Parnas to join him at Shelly's Back Room, a clubby Washington retreat for cigar and whiskey aficionados.

""Sounds good I'll meet you there,"" Parnas answered via text. He said he'd bring Rep. Pete Sessions, a Texas Republican and longtime Giuliani ally who had just lost his seat in the midterm elections.

Parnas' uninvited attendance at the funeral illustrated the meteoric rise and curious position of a man who played Sancho Panza to Giuliani's Don Quixote, a status enabled in part by large contributions to Republican politicians and Trump-related campaign committees.

Lev Parnas, in a WhatsApp message to a major GOP donor I'm officially part of team trump

Parnas is no longer cigar buddies with America's Mayor. Instead, he's dishing about his work with Giuliani in Ukraine and providing reams of messages and documents to House impeachment investigators.

He says the evidence shows Trump approved of his work to pressure Ukraine to investigate Biden. House investigators agree. They've sent it to the Senate for potential consideration in Trump's impeachment trial, currently underway in the Senate.

While Parnas has described his turnabout and prime-time TV interviews as patriotic truth-telling, he's also angling for leniency in a campaign finance case brought against him by federal prosecutors in New York.

Parnas' journey to a state funeral and Manhattan federal court started with his family's emigration from Odessa, Ukraine, to the U.S. when he was three years old.

Now a naturalized U.S. citizen, he grew up in Brooklyn, home to many immigrants from Eastern Europe.

Over the years he sold condos and closed deals. He signed up and fell out with business partners. He started new ventures and watched them fold. He was evicted and sued. He was a doting father described by some as a con man.

By March 2019, jetting around the world with Giuliani, he seemed to have reached a milestone. ""I'm officially part of team trump,"" he wrote in a WhatsApp message to Harry Sargeant III, a wealthy Florida energy mogul and GOP donor.

That may have been true until last week, when House impeachment investigators disclosed the trove of material Parnas turned over.

They contend the evidence bolsters their case that Trump should be removed from office for his role in a scheme to withhold nearly $400 million in U.S. military aid from Ukraine unless government officials there investigated Biden's family.

Giuliani associate Lev Parnas claims Trump knew about Ukraine Rudy Giuliani's associate Lev Parnas said President Trump ""knew exactly what was going on"" in Ukraine. USA TODAY

""President Trump knew exactly what was going on,"" Parnas told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow.

His story, told through impeachment investigation records, court filings and other records and interviews, shows how someone with campaign cash – or the promise of it – managed to become part of Trump's orbit despite some unwelcome baggage. Parnas' attorney, Joseph Bondy, did not respond to an interview request.

""I went from being a top donor, from being at all the events where we would just socialize, to becoming a close friend of Rudy Giuliani's, to eventually becoming his ally and his asset on the ground in Ukraine,"" Parnas told CNN's Anderson Cooper.

One business venture after another

Parnas said his first connection with the Trump family came early in his career, selling Brooklyn apartments for Fred Trump, the president's father. Records of his addresses from the mid-1990s link him to a real estate company not far from the elder Trump's office.

By 1997, Parnas was living in Boca Raton, Florida, where he registered to vote as a Republican. Two years later, he got a license to carry a concealed weapon.

Parnas was a broker for three companies that were expelled by a Wall Street association that self-regulates financial brokerages and brokers. He was not personally implicated in any of the alleged wrongdoing.

By the mid-2000s, Parnas had moved on to Edgetech International, a penny-stock company registered in Nevada. Serving as CEO, he ran the company from a Florida office and marketed an early mobile internet device known as the PC Edge. The company ultimately folded.

""Sometimes we were buying Rolexes,"" he told The Washington Post. ""And sometimes we were selling the Rolexes to make the rent.""

And then there were the times he didn't make the rent. The owner of an apartment complex in Boca Raton repeatedly sued him for failing to pay. A law firm in Hollywood, Florida, sued him in 2012 to collect nearly $27,000 in legal bills for battling eviction from another property.

One creditor has spent a decade chasing Parnas.

In November 2010, Parnas met with Michael Pues, the New Jersey owner of a stone industry company, at the Millennium Hotel in New York City. At the time, Parnas was Pues' investment broker.

Pues had signed up after Parnas touted himself as ""the youngest stockbroker out there,"" someone who was ""driving around in a Bentley"" and never lost money for his clients, according to a court filing.

In late 2010, Parnas asked Pues to invest in a movie called ""Anatomy of an Assassin."" Parnas introduced Pues to Rudy Durand, a Hollywood writer and producer. Durand and actor Jack Nicholson met with Pues in Manhattan's swank Carlyle Hotel to discuss the project, the court filing shows.

Michael Pues, who is pursuing Parnas for a loan he never paid I trusted him with everything. He used to call me family.

Pues said he was impressed. He agreed to provide a short-term, $350,000 loan from his family's trust. He hasn't been repaid, despite years chasing Parnas in court.

A federal judge in Brooklyn issued a $350,000 judgment against Parnas and his Parnas Holdings company in late 2015. With interest, the debt has soared to more than $678,000.

Pues testified that Parnas agreed verbally to return the money after 45 days. But after making the loan, he said he was unable to reach Parnas again.

Instead, a Parnas associate responded by saying the company couldn't repay. Pues said he felt conned by the man he once trusted.

""I trusted him with everything. He used to call me family,"" he said in a court hearing.

Durand, who appeared in court as a witness for the Pues family trust, testified ""that at one time he liked and trusted Lev, but that he later found him to be a con artist,"" according to the judgment.

Trump donations open doors

Despite the debts, Parnas still had access to funds. In October 2016, the closing stretch of the presidential election, he provided financial backing for the son of the man who gave him one of his first jobs.

On the same day that month, Parnas contributed $50,000 to the Trump Victory political action committee and $2,700 to the Donald J. Trump for President campaign committee, the maximum allowed for the general election.

He hadn't donated to federal campaigns before, elections records show. ""I never was in politics,"" he told CNN. ""I was just a businessman trying to get by.""

The PAC contribution listed Parnas' employer as Fraud Guarantee, a company he created in part to ensure that Google searches of his name would produce positive results, rather than surface prior allegations of fraud, The Wall Street Journal reported.

Parnas' company, which offered products and services to guard against investment fraud, had no sign of any customers at the time of the contributions. However, it later received a $1.5 million investment from Magnolia Ventures, a New York City-based venture capital fund.

This Facebook screen shot provided by The Campaign Legal Center, shows President Donald Trump standing with Lev Parnas, top left photo, at the White House in Washington, posted on May 1, 2018. AP

Parnas' donations gave him a seed of credibility among Trump allies. Shortly after Trump took office in January 2017, Parnas tried to advance his business prospects.

He contacted Michael Cohen, who at the time was Trump's personal lawyer and longtime problem fixer, and asked for a meeting with the president, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.

Parnas wanted to discuss a proposal to prevent fraud and waste in government, the person said. It's unclear whether such a meeting took place, though Parnas told CNN he met Cohen a couple of times.

Cohen is serving a three-year prison sentence for evading taxes, lying to Congress and banks, and arranging secret payments to buy the silence of two women who said they had sexual affairs with Trump years before he was elected. Trump has denied the claims.

By 2018, Parnas' donations started to pay off in the form of invitations to Trump fundraisers and other events.

In May 2018, Parnas posted a photo to Facebook. He and Igor Fruman, a Belarus-born business associate and future co-defendant, were sitting at a table with Donald Trump Jr. and Tommy Hicks Jr., a wealthy Trump fundraiser from Texas.

On social media, Parnas posted photo after photo with GOP figures. Trump. Trump Jr. Hicks. And others that Parnas' attorney has publicized recently in response to Trump allies' efforts to disavow or discredit him. They include Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway and former White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

GOP heavyweights were just a text message away

In May 2018, Parnas and Fruman contributed $325,000 to America First Action, a pro-Trump super PAC.

That donation would eventually land them in federal court. Prosecutors accuse them of concealing the true source of the money, part of a scheme to win influence by funneling hundreds of thousands of dollars to U.S. election candidates and campaign committees.

But in the short term, the transaction apparently helped put Parnas in touch with Joseph Ahearn, the director of development for America First Policies, the PAC's sibling nonprofit. Ahearn kept Donald Trump Jr. apprised of Ukraine-related issues.

On March 20, Ahearn sent Parnas a WhatsApp message asking, ""What should I send Don to tweet?"" according to documents Parnas' lawyer provided to House impeachment investigators.

Parnas forwarded some news stories. ""Have jr retweet it,"" he said. Ahearn responded, ""Sent.""

A few days later, Parnas sent Ahearn a link to a Daily Wire story headlined, ""Calls Grow To Remove Obama’s U.S. Ambassador To Ukraine."" The same day, Trump Jr. tweeted the link.

Hicks, the wealthy Trump family loyalist who's now the co-chair of the Republican National Committee, also exchanged messages with Parnas. He advised Parnas that the owner of The Daily Caller, a conservative news and opinion website, was a friend.

""We should let him know what we know at the right time,"" he messaged Parnas, who responded ""100%.""

Harry Sargeant III, in a WhatsApp message to Lev Parnas Just becoming expensive to fly you guys everywhere LEV

But even as Parnas corresponded and hobnobbed with political elites, he had to figure out how to pay for it all, and how to support his family.

Sargeant, the Florida businessman, funded some of Parnas' travel as he jetted to Ukraine and elsewhere in Europe, documents released by House impeachment investigators show.

On April 10, Parnas messaged Sargeant via WhatsApp after discovering that a trip to Vienna had been canceled.

""Just becoming expensive to fly you guys everywhere LEV,"" Sargeant replied.

Sargeant's attorney has said his client loaned the funds after Parnas said he was broke and pledged to repay it.

Parnas seemed eager to defuse the situation. “We are never expecting you to pay for it my brother that’s why we wanted to do the loan so we don’t have to bother you,"" he told Sargeant.

The relationship nonetheless continued.

At one point, Parnas asked Sargeant to call, dangling the prospect of ""juicy stuff."" When Sargeant asked what it was, Parnas demurred. A week later, he told Sargeant, ""Working hard to save our country my brother!!!!""

'A middleman between two worlds'

Giuliani told Reuters that Parnas' Fraud Guarantee firm paid him $500,000 for legal and technical consulting work in 2018. The money actually came from Charles Gucciardo, a Republican donor and Trump supporter from Long Island, The New York Times reported.

Gucciardo agreed to invest in Fraud Guarantee because it was a ""company that Rudolph Giuliani was going to be the spokesman and the face of,"" said Gucciardo's attorney, Randy Zelin, according to the report.

That deal meant Giuliani was working for Parnas. Yet in a May 2019 tweet, he identified Parnas and Fruman as his legal clients.

Their relationship apparently strengthened as Giuliani realized Parnas' language ability and Fruman's contacts in Ukraine could help him investigate the financial dealings of Hunter Biden, the son of Joe Biden. The younger Biden had been a well-compensated board member of Burisma Holdings, a Ukraine energy company.

Giuliani has alleged that Joe Biden abused his office by urging the 2016 firing of Viktor Shokin, at the time Ukraine's chief prosecutor, out of concern that Shokin might implicate Hunter Biden in a corruption investigation.

Parnas was Giuliani's go-between with Yuriy Lutsenko, who until August was the chief prosecutor in Ukraine. In WhatsApp messages written in Russian, Lutsenko complained about U.S. Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch and pressed for her removal.

""She is not a simple stupid woman, believe me,"" Parnas responded. ""Well, she won't get away for long.""

Dispatch from Ukraine: Trump's conspiracy theories thrive in Ukraine, where a young democracy battles corruption and distrust

Around May 2018, Parnas and Fruman met separately with Sessions, a Texas Republican and longtime Giuliani backer. They pledged to raise $20,000 for Sessions' reelection, according to the criminal indictment against the Soviet-born partners.

Sessions wrote a May 9, 2018, letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claiming he had evidence Yovanovitch had disparaged Trump and asking for her removal. Sessions later said the letter was unrelated to Parnas and Fruman.

Sessions, who received a federal grand jury subpoena in the campaign finance case, has said he had no involvement in the alleged scheme.

Parnas sent Giuliani a copy of Sessions' letter in December 2018. Later that day, Parnas texted: ""Just spoke with Pete I'll update you tomorrow.""

In April 2019, Giuliani texted Parnas an update that appeared to refer to either Pompeo or Trump: ""He fired her again.""

""I pray it happens this time I'll call you tomorrow my brother,"" replied Parnas.

Pressed by Trump, the Department of State abruptly recalled Yovanovitch to Washington, D.C., the next day.

The Giuliani-Parnas partnership ruptures

After Trump's July phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, an unidentified whistleblower filed a complaint that ultimately triggered the impeachment proceedings against Trump.

The whistleblower complained that the president appeared to abuse his office with an improper quid pro quo: withholding congressionally-approved U.S. military aid for Ukraine while pressing Zelensky for an investigation of the Biden family.

Trump has denied the allegations, calling the phone call ""perfect"" and characterizing the impeachment proceedings as a hoax.

In October, three months after that complaint, Parnas and Fruman were arrested before they boarded a plane to Europe with one-way tickets. The indictment alleged that their scheme, carried out with help from an unidentified Ukrainian government official and funding from a Russian national, was aimed at buying ""potential influence with candidates, campaigns, and the candidates' governments.""

Parnas, Fruman and two co-defendants pleaded not guilty.

Then Giuliani learned that federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, the office he once led and the one that charged Parnas and Fruman, were investigating his business dealings.

Giuliani said he had done nothing improper.

The day after Parnas and Fruman were arrested, House impeachment investigators issued subpoenas. The two initially said they would not cooperate. At the time, their attorney was John Dowd, a longtime Giuliani ally and former lawyer for Trump.

But Parnas changed lawyers and decided to cooperate. His disclosures to House investigators torpedoed his relationship with Giuliani.

Giuliani declared Tuesday he was ""heartbroken"" over the rupture. He told Fox News' Laura Ingraham he wouldn't respond to all of Parnas' accusations about their dealings, saying, ""He in very large part did not tell the truth.""

Trump repeated an earlier denial that he did not know Parnas. In response, Bondy tweeted a video showing Parnas with his arm on Trump's shoulder during a Mar-a-Lago event in Florida as he introduced the nation's commander-in-chief to a Ukrainian government official.

No recent selfies of Parnas and GOP heavyweights have surfaced. Instead, his lawyer has posted photos of Parnas smiling with the TV journalists who interviewed him about his exploits.

House of Representatives investigators are looking into whether President Donald Trump lied to special counsel Robert Mueller during the Russia probe.

""Did the president lie?"" a House lawyer said in court as he requested files from the special counsel's inquiry.

Congressional impeachment lawmakers are reportedly scrutinising the president's statements to Mr Mueller on WikiLeaks.

The main thrust of the Democratic-led inquiry is on alleged abuse of power by Mr Trump in US-Ukraine relations.

Lawmakers first requested classified grand jury materials from the report in July.

A judge in October granted this access, though the Department of Justice appealed. Monday's hearing was to determine whether the appeal should temporarily block the previous grant of access.

Congress has seen most of the Mueller report - including some redacted parts - but certain grand jury material has remained secret.

Doug Letter, representing the House Judiciary Committee - which would eventually be responsible for filing articles of impeachment against the president - spoke to the federal appeals court on Monday.

He said the impeachment inquiry was looking into the Ukraine matter but revealed lawmakers were also investigating whether Mr Trump lied to Mr Mueller during the course of the probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.

Mr Letter has requested the redacted parts of the Mueller report and the full transcripts related to those portions.

Mr Trump did not testify in the Mueller investigation, but he did submit written responses to some questions from the Mueller team.

During Mr Mueller's testimony before Congress in July, he was asked whether Mr Trump's incomplete written responses showed he was not always telling the truth. Mr Mueller replied: ""I would say, generally.""

It is unclear what exactly Mr Mueller meant by his response, but Mr Letter told the court on Monday he believed it meant the president ""had been untruthful in some of his answers"".

US media report Mr Letter may have been referring to whether Mr Trump lied about contacts with WikiLeaks and knowledge that they were going to publish hacked Democratic emails.

Mr Letter added that evidence from the recent trial of Trump adviser Roger Stone strengthened lawmakers' argument for obtaining the secret material.

Stone, who was convicted last week of lying to Congress about his work with WikiLeaks, had several calls with Mr Trump during the 2016 election.

The president has said he did not know of any contact between his campaign and WikiLeaks and that he did not discuss WikiLeaks with Stone.

A lawyer for the justice department argued that the impeachment inquiry was not a judicial proceeding and thus it was not legal for lawmakers to view classified grand jury material.

As he did with the Mueller report, the president has dismissed the impeachment probe as a ""witch hunt"".

This week, eight individuals are due to testify before House lawmakers as a part of the impeachment proceedings.

On Tuesday, Lt Col Alexander Vindman, a Ukraine expert on the National Security Council who listened in on Mr Trump's July call with Ukraine's President Zelensky, will testify.

US President Donald Trump's defence team in his Senate trial will include special prosecutors from President Bill Clinton's impeachment.

He will be represented by Ken Starr and Robert Ray, who investigated Mr Clinton, and Alan Dershowitz, whose past clients include OJ Simpson.

White House counsel Pat Cipollone and Mr Trump's personal lawyer Jay Sekulow will lead the team.

Opening statements in the Trump impeachment trial will begin next week.

Who are the Clinton prosecutors?

Mr Starr was the US Department of Justice independent counsel who investigated the Whitewater affair, a scandal-plagued mid-1980s land venture in Arkansas involving Bill and Hillary Clinton.

The inquiry ultimately uncovered unrelated evidence that Mr Clinton had been having an affair with a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky.

The investigation culminated in the Democratic president's impeachment by the US House of Representatives in 1998. Mr Clinton was acquitted by the Senate.

Mr Ray succeeded Mr Starr as the independent counsel.

Ms Lewinsky tweeted on Friday shortly after Mr Trump's team was announced: ""This is definitely an 'are you kidding me?' kinda day"", though she inserted an expletive.

In 2016, Mr Starr was forced out of his position as president of Baylor University after an inquiry found the school had mishandled rape accusations against its football players.

He later also resigned from his roles as chancellor and law professor at the university.

Who is Alan Dershowitz?

Mr Dershowitz is a retired Harvard University law professor and constitutional law expert whose past celebrity clients have also included boxer Mike Tyson.

He told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that he had spoken with the president on Wednesday about the impeachment case.

""I agreed to do it as an independent constitutional scholar,"" Mr Dershowitz said. ""I take no position on the politics - just on the constitution.""

He added he was ""very, very concerned"" about the precedent this impeachment could establish.

""It could weaken the presidency and weaponise impeachment as a partisan tactic,"" he said.

Mr Dershowitz said in a statement that he had also opposed Mr Clinton's impeachment, and voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election.

Who else is on the legal team?

Former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi has also been asked to join the team.

Mrs Bondi, a longtime Trump ally, joined the White House communications team last November to focus on ""proactive impeachment messaging"".

The president's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, a central figure in the Ukraine investigation, had also hoped to join the defence, but he did not make the cut.

Mr Giuliani told CBS he might be called as a witness in the impeachment trial and ""understood this may happen if I uncovered the 2016 Ukrainian corruption"".

Mr Trump's allies have rubbished Mr Parnas' claims, pointing out that he is facing unrelated campaign finance charges.

Why was Trump impeached?

Mr Trump was impeached by the US House of Representatives last month on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.

Democrats have accused him of withholding military aid to Ukraine to pressure the country into investigating his political rival, former US Vice-President Joe Biden.

Mr Trump denies the claims, and calls the impeachment proceedings a partisan ""hoax"".

The Republican president now faces a trial in the Senate, which must decide whether to remove him from office.

As his Republican party holds a majority in the upper chamber, he is expected to be acquitted.

The Clinton example

History shows it’s possible for Congress to be productive during impeachment hearings.

By the time the House voted to impeach President Bill Clinton in December 1998, the Republican-held Congress had already passed the next year’s budget. Between the start of House impeachment proceedings in October 1998 and acquittal by by the Senate in February, President Clinton signed nearly 150 bills into law.

In today’s era of extreme partisanship, however, Congress has become far less productive – even without impeachment. Just under 70 laws – including eight that renamed post offices – have been signed in the 10 months that the 116th Congress has been in session, a figure that reflects years of declining legislative activity. A 2018 analysis by The Washington Post and ProPublica shows that as the political center has shrunk, and as lawmakers increasingly respond to the demands of their base, Congress’s capacity for deliberative dealmaking has withered.

“The Congress we’re working with is a completely different institution in many ways than the Congress that faced the Clinton impeachment,” says Aubrey Neal, who manages federal government affairs at the R Street Institute, a center-right think tank.

Mr. Clinton actually made attention to his “day job” a key component of his political strategy. In public appearances, he pointedly ignored the impeachment effort and focused on the business of governance.

“He didn’t use it to rally his party; he didn’t use it to defend himself,” says Professor Schneider, who at the time was a political analyst for CNN. “He made it clear that it wasn’t distracting him.”

Even after the House voted to impeach him, Mr. Clinton kept to his message, vowing to continue to work on behalf of the American people. “It’s what I’ve tried to do for six years,” he said. “It’s what I intend to do for two more until the last hour of the last day of my term.”

Work behind the scenes

Despite all the vitriol, there’s at least some bipartisan work going on behind the scenes. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), Mr. Trump’s signature trade deal, is in the “last mile” of negotiations, Ms. Pelosi said at the end of October. Lawmakers are reportedly looking to announce a deal by Thanksgiving and could even hold a vote before year’s end.

WASHINGTON — Lev Parnas , a key associate to Rudy Giuliani , a lawyer working for President Donald Trump who ran the Ukrainian backchannel campaign at the center of his impeachment , told MSNBC on Wednesday that `` President Trump knew exactly what was going on . '' `` He was aware of all my movements . I would n't do anything without the consent of Rudy Giuliani or the president , '' Parnas , who was indicted on campaign finance charges , told MSNBC host Rachel Maddow . `` Why would [ Ukrainian ] President Zelenskiy 's inner circle or Minister Avakov or all these people or President Poroshenko meet with me ? Who am I ? They were told to meet with me . And that 's the secret that they 're trying to keep . I was on the ground doing their work . ''
The interview aired after House Democrats released hundreds of pages of new documents related to the impeachment inquiry into President Trump , including texts and notes turned over by Parnas . Three House committees sent the evidence to the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday “ to be included as part of the official record that will be transmitted to the Senate along with the Articles of Impeachment. ” The House sent the articles to the Senate on Wednesday evening . In a statement to MSNBC as the interview aired , Giuliani said Parnas had `` never '' spoken on behalf of Trump in his meetings . He added that Parnas is `` a very sad situation . '' The evidence sent by the Intelligence , Oversight , and Foreign Affairs committees included documents provided recently by Parnas , who helped Giuliani dig up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden , in response to a subpoena he received from the House in October . The committees said the evidence also included call records , which they did not make public due to their sensitivity . “ All of this new evidence confirms what we already know : the President and his associates pressured Ukrainian officials to announce investigations that would benefit the President politically , ” the chairs of all four committees said in a statement . The committees said Parnas “ continues to provide material responsive to the subpoena on a rolling basis. ” Here are some highlights from the documents the committees made public :
Parnas ’ s handwritten notes show plans to get the Ukrainians to investigate Joe Biden House Intelligence Committee , House Intelligence Committee / Via intelligence.house.gov

WASHINGTON — Lev Parnas, a key associate to Rudy Giuliani, a lawyer working for President Donald Trump who ran the Ukrainian backchannel campaign at the center of his impeachment, told MSNBC on Wednesday that ""President Trump knew exactly what was going on."" ""He was aware of all my movements. I wouldn't do anything without the consent of Rudy Giuliani or the president,"" Parnas, who was indicted on campaign finance charges, told MSNBC host Rachel Maddow. ""Why would [Ukrainian] President Zelenskiy's inner circle or Minister Avakov or all these people or President Poroshenko meet with me? Who am I? They were told to meet with me. And that's the secret that they're trying to keep. I was on the ground doing their work.""

The interview aired after House Democrats released hundreds of pages of new documents related to the impeachment inquiry into President Trump, including texts and notes turned over by Parnas. Three House committees sent the evidence to the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday “to be included as part of the official record that will be transmitted to the Senate along with the Articles of Impeachment.” The House sent the articles to the Senate on Wednesday evening. In a statement to MSNBC as the interview aired, Giuliani said Parnas had ""never"" spoken on behalf of Trump in his meetings. He added that Parnas is ""a very sad situation."" The evidence sent by the Intelligence, Oversight, and Foreign Affairs committees included documents provided recently by Parnas, who helped Giuliani dig up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden, in response to a subpoena he received from the House in October. The committees said the evidence also included call records, which they did not make public due to their sensitivity. “All of this new evidence confirms what we already know: the President and his associates pressured Ukrainian officials to announce investigations that would benefit the President politically,” the chairs of all four committees said in a statement. The committees said Parnas “continues to provide material responsive to the subpoena on a rolling basis.” Here are some highlights from the documents the committees made public:

After his impeachment and acquittal in the Senate in 1868, the incumbent President Andrew Johnson’s Democratic Party denied him the nomination for president. After House Republicans impeached Democratic President Bill Clinton William (Bill) Jefferson ClintonThis will be a wild weekend in New Hampshire Why Mitt Romney's courageous vote to convict Trump matters Nearly half want congressional Democrats to have more influence than Trump: poll MORE, his approval rating jumped 10 percent, his highest ever.

Not so with Donald Trump’s impeachment and acquittal in these ferociously partisan times, even though his conduct was far worse than Johnson’s or Clinton’s. Johnson was impeached for firing a Cabinet officer in violation of a law later found to be unconstitutional. Clinton lied under oath about an extramarital affair. Trump was willing to let a vital American ally go down to defeat in its war with Russia unless it announced, notwithstanding the lack of any evidentiary justification, that it was investigating Trump’s then-leading political rival. Trump’s conduct was condemned or defended almost exclusively on a partisan basis, and public opinion barely moved.

Then Romney stepped over a San Andreas-size national political fault line. He explained his vote to convict Trump for abuse of power (he voted to acquit on the charge of obstruction of Congress) by saying that the president in fact pressured a foreign government “to corrupt” the 2020 presidential election. “Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one’s oath of office that I can imagine,” Romney said.

It was a moment of stunning clarity and singular courage. Romney knew that Trump and his allies would demand his “head on a pike.” Republicans immediately impugned Romney’s motives by claiming that he acted from personal animosity towards Trump, and it's only going to get worse.

What’s happening

Quid pro quo. Quid pro quo. Quid pro quo. A phrase that was previously unknown to anyone who wasn’t a legal expert or Latin enthusiast suddenly seems to be the most important three words in America.

The impeachment inquiry into President Trump has brought the saying — which translates as “something for something” — into the popular lexicon. At issue is whether Trump should be impeached for withholding $391 million in aid money (the quid) in order to compel Ukraine to investigate the business dealings of Joe Biden’s son (the quo).

The phrase literally means an exchange between two parties, but it has historically carried a connotation of impropriety. The question of a quid pro quo is frequently raised in legal cases considering corruption, bribery and extortion.

Why there’s debate

Much of the public debate since the launch of the impeachment inquiry has centered around whether available evidence proves the existence of a quid pro quo.

Trump has repeatedly said there was no quid pro quo in his dealings with Ukraine. Democrats say they have clear evidence of one. Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said a quid pro quo “happens all the time” and everyone should “get over it,” before later retracting those statements.

Not everyone believes a quid pro quo is the key to impeachment, however. Rep. Adam Schiff, who’s leading the inquiry for the Democrats, said “there doesn’t need to be a quid pro quo” to determine that the president abused his power. Some Republicans, on the other hand, have argued that quid pro quos are common in foreign policy.

Some political analysts worry that too much focus on an archaic, ill-defined phrase like quid pro quo confuses the public, especially when a much more common and well-understood concept, bribery, is explicitly mentioned in the Constitution’s impeachment clause. “When you’re trying to persuade the American people of something that is really pretty simple … it is probably best not to use Latin words to explain it,” said Democratic Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut.

What’s next

The inquiry moves into a new stage this week with the start of public hearings. Questions about the president’s motives in his dealings with Ukraine will be a key part of witness testimony. It’s unclear, however, whether the importance of the phrase “quid pro quo” will continue now that the proceedings are open to public view.

Perspectives

The inquiry should focus on bribery rather than quid pro quo

“Enough with all the Latin. ‘Quid pro quo’ is a namby-pamby, wishy-washy way to describe the crime President Trump clearly committed in his dealings with Ukraine. The correct term is bribery.” — Eugene Robinson, Washington Post

Quid pro quo isn’t an important phrase in the legal basis for impeachment

“The term doesn't appear in the whistleblower complaint that set the entire impeachment inquiry in motion. It doesn't appear in the Constitution, which lays out the impeachment process as punishment for ‘Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.’ It's not in the Federalist Papers, where Alexander Hamilton expanded on what those crimes might be.” — Zachary B.

Trump’s strategy backfired after evidence of a quid pro quo became clear

“Donald Trump’s defenses tend to boil down to catchphrases: ‘no collusion,’ for instance, or ‘no quid pro quo.’ In the latter case, however, he may have hit a stumbling block.” — Kevin Fitzpatrick, Vanity Fair

Quid pro quo is not necessary for impeachment

“This quid-pro-quo dispute misses the larger, and more important, point: What Trump did was wrong, and an abuse of his power as president, irrespective of whether there was a quid pro quo.” — Robert Robb, Arizona Republic

Quid pro quo is a common strategy in foreign relations

“Quid pro quo just means ‘this for that.’ It’s an exchange, and it is a feature of all commerce.

Former Vice President Joe Biden called for President Trump's impeachment and removal from office, on Wednesday.

Up until now, Biden had reserved judgment, saying he supported the House's impeachment inquiry and wanted to see what the facts showed.

But in a campaign speech in Rochester, N.H., Biden was unequivocal, saying that ""to preserve our Constitution, our democracy, our basic integrity, [Trump] should be impeached.""

Biden said the case was already clear before the public.

""With his words and his actions, President Trump has indicted himself. By obstructing justice, refusing to comply with the congressional inquiry, he's already convicted himself,"" Biden said. ""In full view of the world and the American people, Donald Trump has violated his oath of office, betrayed this nation and committed impeachable acts.""

Biden later argued that ""impeachment isn't only about what the president has done — it's about the threat the president poses to the nation if allowed to remain in office.""

Accordingly, Biden said, Congress should remove him before voters go to polls to choose the president on Election Day next year.

Biden and his family were the subject of an effort by Trump to request political assistance from the government of Ukraine that was connected to U.S. military assistance and offers of engagement with Trump himself.

Trump, his aides and some State Department diplomats were involved with an effort to get Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to launch investigations into Biden's family and into a conspiracy theory believed by Trump about the political interference in the 2016 presidential race.

Trump has defended the propriety of those actions and also called for the government of China to investigate the Biden family, too. Trump and his supporters have sought to call attention to what they call the questionable business dealings of Biden's son Hunter.

The president mocked the Bidens on Wednesday on Twitter in a response to the campaign speech.

Deadlock in Washington

The back and forth between Trump and Biden followed the White House's declaration on Tuesday that it would not accommodate Congress with documents or witnesses in the impeachment inquiry.

Without a vote to initiate an inquiry by the full House, argued White House counsel Pat Cipollone, there is no impeachment inquiry the administration is bound to respect.

But White House officials also won't commit to cooperating with Congress if the House were to convene a vote on launching an impeachment inquiry.

Biden used his speech in New Hampshire to fault what he called that rejection laws and democratic norms, saying of the president that ""he is seeing no limits to his power regardless of what the Constitution says"" and that ""he believes if he does something, it's legal — period.""

Trump ""believes he can and will get away with anything he does. We all laughed when he said he could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot someone and get away with it,"" said Biden, alluding a statement Trump made during the 2016 campaign.

""It's no joke,"" Biden insisted. ""He's shooting holes in the Constitution, and we can not let him get away with it.""

Biden has led the crowded Democratic primary field since he entered the race but has since been caught in polling by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren —who earlier called for Trump's impeachment.

A Biden aide says that the former vice president has seen the past two weeks as ""a remarkable period in American history"" that made clear what he believes are Trump's obstruction and wrongdoing. That gave Biden no choice but to make his stance on impeachment clear, the aide says.

Devin Nunes ( R-Calif. ) , the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee , to offer Republican members of that panel the opportunity to submit written questions to his client ’ s legal team .

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy ( R-Calif. ) said Sunday that he was not aware of Zaid ’ s proposal , and while he did not say he would refuse the opportunity to provide written questions , he stressed that the whistleblower “ should come before the committee . ”

While the president has insisted on the necessity of in-person testimony from the whistleblower , Trump himself never sat for an interview with Robert Mueller 's squad of federal prosecutors over the course of the former special counsel 's 22-month investigation , instead supplying written answers through his lawyers .
Sen. Chuck Grassley ( R-Iowa ) did not directly criticize the president Monday when asked about Trump 's demands for the media to out the whistleblower , but cautioned that statutes governing the protection of such informants must be followed .

There was no definitive “ yes , Trump broke the law by doing x , y and z ” in the 448 pages of the Mueller report . Rather , it painted a detailed picture of a president who may have obstructed justice in the legal sense and whose campaign welcomed Russia ’ s help but didn ’ t reach the legal definition of collusion with a foreign power…
“ By contrast , the Ukraine allegations can be summed in up in a sentence… ‘ The president of the United States may have used his position to pressure a foreign country into investigating a political opponent , and he sought to use U.S. taxpayer dollars as leverage to do it . ’ ”
“ Impeaching Trump over Robert Mueller ’ s findings in the Russia investigation would have been an attempt to address past offenses ; impeaching Trump over these calls [ to Ukraine ] would be an attempt to halt what sure looks like an ongoing attempt to hijack American foreign policy in service of the president ’ s reelection… Whereas the Russia investigation was backward looking , an attempt to uncover what exactly had occurred in a prior election , the Ukraine scandal reflects the president ’ s contemporary and future-looking behavior…
“ Under this logic , it doesn ’ t actually matter so much that impeachment will invariably fail in the Senate .

“ It also means that Congress should avoid issues that implicate Trump ’ s conduct before he became president… Finally , articles of impeachment should not include alleged violations of the Emoluments Clause… It would be unwise to impeach the president over a disputed point of constitutional law when Congress has not even sought to take plainly available steps—like passing laws , for example—to prohibit the offensive activity… [ Democrats need ] to focus on those offenses that make the strongest case of misuse of presidential power , rather than wading into difficult questions concerning the impeachability of pre-presidential conduct , sexual misconduct , racism or other moral failures . ”

Soleimani was a supremely powerful leader of a state apparatus , with his own cult of personality , but he was not a terror kingpin . His death doesn ’ t decapitate anything .

How will Iran fight it ? How will the U.S. respond ? What credible allies will we have , after Trump ’ s trashing of the nuclear deal thoroughly alienated Europe ? Who will believe any intelligence about Iran ’ s actions and intentions from an administration that can ’ t function without telling lies ? …What is our war aim , and how can it be aligned with Trump ’ s obvious desire to be rid of any entanglement in the region ? What will happen if Jerusalem becomes a target and Israel enters the conflict ? What will the American people accept by way of sacrifice , when nothing has prepared them for this ? There ’ s no sign that anyone in power , least of all the president , has even asked these questions , let alone knows how to answer them . ”
“ By declaring that the United States will respond with airstrikes to any attacks on American targets or assets , Mr. Trump is drawing a bright red line that Iran can not cross . And yet , Iran relies on a network of proxy actors from Yemen , Syria , Iraq and Lebanon . Must they all respect Mr. Trump ’ s red line ? There are plenty of hotheads in those proxy forces that will be incensed by the assassination , the same way young men with weapons and minimal discipline often are… Mr. Trump can ’ t keep an entire region from crossing his red line , making violent conflict all the more likely if the president holds to it… ‍ “ It is crucial that influential Republican senators like Lindsey Graham , Marco Rubio and Mitch McConnell remind Mr. Trump of his promise to keep America out of foreign quagmires and keep Mr. Trump from stumbling further into war with Iran . ”","From the Left

“It also means that Congress should avoid issues that implicate Trump’s conduct before he became president… Finally, articles of impeachment should not include alleged violations of the Emoluments Clause… It would be unwise to impeach the president over a disputed point of constitutional law when Congress has not even sought to take plainly available steps—like passing laws, for example—to prohibit the offensive activity… [Democrats need] to focus on those offenses that make the strongest case of misuse of presidential power, rather than wading into difficult questions concerning the impeachability of pre-presidential conduct, sexual misconduct, racism or other moral failures.”

Susan Hennessey, Quinta Jurecic, Benjamin Wittes, Lawfare Blog

“The main question about the strike isn’t moral or even legal—it’s strategic. Soleimani was a supremely powerful leader of a state apparatus, with his own cult of personality, but he was not a terror kingpin. His death doesn’t decapitate anything. He had the blood of tens of thousands of people—overwhelmingly fellow Muslims—on his hands, but he was only the agent of a government policy that preceded him and will continue without him…The only reason to kill Soleimani is to enter a new war that the United States can win… [Yet] No one seems to have thought past the action itself… ‍ “What would [a] war [with Iran] look like? How will Iran fight it? How will the U.S. respond? What credible allies will we have, after Trump’s trashing of the nuclear deal thoroughly alienated Europe? Who will believe any intelligence about Iran’s actions and intentions from an administration that can’t function without telling lies?…What is our war aim, and how can it be aligned with Trump’s obvious desire to be rid of any entanglement in the region? What will happen if Jerusalem becomes a target and Israel enters the conflict? What will the American people accept by way of sacrifice, when nothing has prepared them for this? There’s no sign that anyone in power, least of all the president, has even asked these questions, let alone knows how to answer them.”

George Packer, The Atlantic

“By declaring that the United States will respond with airstrikes to any attacks on American targets or assets, Mr. Trump is drawing a bright red line that Iran cannot cross. And yet, Iran relies on a network of proxy actors from Yemen, Syria, Iraq and Lebanon. Must they all respect Mr. Trump’s red line? There are plenty of hotheads in those proxy forces that will be incensed by the assassination, the same way young men with weapons and minimal discipline often are… Mr. Trump can’t keep an entire region from crossing his red line, making violent conflict all the more likely if the president holds to it… ‍ “It is crucial that influential Republican senators like Lindsey Graham, Marco Rubio and Mitch McConnell remind Mr. Trump of his promise to keep America out of foreign quagmires and keep Mr. Trump from stumbling further into war with Iran.”

impeachment,Politico,0,https://www.politico.com/news/2019/09/26/nancy-pelosi-impeachment-trump-002118,Why Pelosi and her party finally embraced impeachment,2019-09-26,Rep. Angie Craig,"Hoyer responded that he ’ d come to the same conclusion over the weekend following a wave of stunning news reports about Trump ’ s attempts to pressure Ukraine — and potentially withhold military assistance from the U.S. ally — for his own political benefit .
“ The facts drove the timing and the decision , ” Pelosi told ███ in a brief interview . “ And that ’ s what I ’ ve said all along — when we get the facts , we will be ready . And we ’ re ready . ”
Pelosi ’ s decision followed months of Democratic infighting . She had also faced a barrage of criticism from the party ’ s activist base , which had begun to question her once-impeccable progressive credentials .
And the move comes with risks . Public opinion , for now , still remains against impeachment , and the inquiry could jeopardize her majority in 2020 while giving Trump a boost in his reelection bid .
But Pelosi had also maintained her keen sense of the caucus , and knew that Democrats were erupting in the days after the Ukraine scandal began to unspool .
While on a plane back to Washington that night , Pelosi scrolled through a Washington Post op-ed that had published minutes earlier from seven vulnerable Democratic freshmen — and long-time impeachment holdouts — backing proceedings to remove Trump from office . The op-ed underscored how quickly the political ground was shifting among Democrats .
In fact , Pelosi had spoken to the group on a conference call on Monday night , offering guidance before their op-ed went live .
She then started jotting down notes , the first draft of her own speech endorsing an inquiry — words that would not only formalize the House investigation but potentially change the course of the nation and define her storied career .
But there was a hiccup : “ I put down some notes on the plane at 10 p.m. at night but then I left it on the plane , ” Pelosi said .
Less than 24 hours later , after first informing her 235-member caucus of the decision in a private meeting , Pelosi walked out to a podium on the speaker ’ s balcony , in front of a wall of American flags , and spoke to the country .
“ The president must be held accountable . No one is above the law , ” Pelosi declared , describing Trump ’ s actions as a “ betrayal of his oath of office . ”
And then Pelosi went where she hadn ’ t been willing to go before publicly : “ Therefore , today I 'm announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry . ”
For the Democrats who had been pressing for an impeachment probe for months — at times experiencing Pelosi ’ s wrath along the way — the speaker ’ s words were stunning . Just a week before , those very same Democrats were privately lamenting that their campaign to impeach Trump was quickly running out of time after several attempts to win public support had failed to materialize .
“ I ’ ve always thought it was inevitable , ” Rep. Jamie Raskin ( D-Md . ) said of impeaching Trump . “ Here , he essentially bragged about what he had done . And the truth is plain to see . The Latin phrase is res ipsa loquitur — the thing speaks for itself . ”
Four months earlier , Democratic leaders worried they were on the verge of losing control of the impeachment narrative .
It was May 22 , and two days before , Trump had barred former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before the House Judiciary Committee about the president ’ s alleged obstruction of justice .
Furious with Trump ’ s stonewalling — and the missed opportunity to hear from special counsel Robert Mueller ’ s star witness — a few members of Pelosi ’ s leadership team clashed with her privately over the issue and were now getting ready to break with the speaker and openly call for impeachment proceedings against the president .
So Pelosi , who keeps a notoriously tight grip on her members , convened her lieutenants in bid to rein in the pro-impeachment revolt before it was too late .
That was when Rep. Cheri Bustos , an Illinois moderate who chairs the House Democrats ’ campaign arm , made a pronouncement that stunned the room .
“ We just need to let all this Mueller stuff go , ” Bustos said , according to three sources who attended the meeting .
Bustos ’ comment reflected a deepening sentiment among senior House leaders and a faction of Democratic moderates who wanted nothing to do with impeachment talk . Bustos has said publicly that she supports the House ’ s Mueller-related investigations , but she has also long argued that voters care more about kitchen-table issues .
But to the faction of Democrats seeking formal impeachment proceedings , Bustos ’ suggestion had come at precisely the moment they needed to get more aggressive with a hostile White House . The Trump administration would soon stonewall Congress on a host of subpoenas for witnesses and documents , effectively making a mockery of lawmakers ’ constitutional oversight powers .
That meeting was the beginning of a rupture that consumed the Democratic Caucus for months . It marked one of the first times Pelosi tried to walk the tightrope between the liberals who helped elect her as speaker and the moderates who delivered Democrats the House in 2018 — a delicate balancing act that became ever more difficult to manage .
It was also when Democrats who backed impeachment made a conscious choice : they weren ’ t going to simply fall in line with their party leaders and were going to continue organizing colleagues to join the impeachment cause .
“ I believe we had enough to file articles of impeachment right after the [ Mueller ] report initially came out , ” said Rep. Val Demings ( D-Fla. ) , one of just three lawmakers who sits on both the Judiciary and Intelligence committees .
In the weeks and months following the release of the Mueller report , pro-impeachment Democrats believed that the holdouts in the caucus were underestimating Trump ’ s ability to “ self-impeach ” through his actions and penchant to seek revenge against political enemies .
“ I feel like we were indecisive and overly cautious , ” said Rep. Jared Huffman ( D-Calif. ) , an early impeachment supporter . “ And frankly we did way too much political parsing when we should have taken this obvious bombshell , added it to the many other obvious impeachable bombshells that we already had , and begun doing our job . ”
But the caucus was divided and the fracture was getting harder to ignore .
Pelosi and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler ( D-N.Y. ) had been sparring for months over the issue . Just last week , Pelosi criticized the Judiciary Committee ’ s handling of impeachment in harsh terms behind closed doors and even encouraged people in the room to leak her complaints .
And then , just as the impeachment effort appeared to be sputtering , everything changed .
A nondescript , late-night press release from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff ( D-Calif. ) landed in reporters ’ inboxes on Sept. 13 revealing the existence of an intelligence community whistleblower that the Trump administration had refused to let talk to Congress . Within days , the Trump-Ukraine scandal had exploded across Washington .
The calls started rolling in to Pelosi in earnest last Friday night .
Earlier that week , the Washington Post had revealed details about a mysterious whistleblower complaint being withheld from Congress . It involved a “ promise ” Trump made while talking with a foreign leader .
Then a blockbuster follow-up report from the Wall Street Journal a few day later blew apart Democratic leaders ’ delicately knitted attempt to hold off an impeachment investigation . The report detailed how Trump “ repeatedly ” pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son in a July phone call while simultaneously withholding military aide from the country .
For many Democrats , that was what was missing from previous Trump scandals . Trump was allegedly using his office to extort a foreign leader to help benefit his reelection campaign , a move that smacked of the Richard Nixon era for many in the party .
“ Here we ’ re talking about potentially ongoing , gross abuses of power . We ’ re talking about a sitting president , not a candidate for president . And we ’ re talking about the current campaign , not a past campaign , ” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi ( D-Ill. ) said in an interview just minutes after viewing the classified whistleblower complaint in the Intelligence Committee ’ s underground bunker at the Capitol Wednesday night .
As the Ukraine scandal quickly ballooned , progressive activists got restless . Late Saturday night , freshman liberal Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ( D-N.Y. ) wrote on Twitter that Democratic leaders ’ refusal to impeach Trump was “ the bigger national scandal ” than the president ’ s “ lawbreaking behavior . ”
But Pelosi wasn ’ t going to rush into any decision . She was a rising backbencher when the House impeached President Bill Clinton in 1998 , and she knew that impeachment proceedings against Trump would be just as divisive to the nation .
Pelosi was also convinced that it would distract from her party ’ s legislative priorities on health care and drug costs , gun violence and other key issues . The Democratic domestic agenda — as well as Trump ’ s growing unpopularity in the suburbs — had driven the party to a huge House win in November and vaulted Pelosi back into the speaker ’ s chair after eight years in the minority .
The California Democrat also knew that Trump ’ s stranglehold over the GOP meant no Republicans were going to back impeachment unless there was an air-tight case against the president . And she feared that impeaching Trump on partisan lines was a risk to the Democratic majority .
So Pelosi took the heat from the Democratic base — and within her own caucus — over her resistance to impeachment . She at times grew exasperated by the criticism , privately clashing with some members of her leadership team while asserting publicly that Trump “ isn ’ t even worth ” impeaching .
One other important factor weighed heavily on Pelosi — her “ frontline ” members in the toughest swing districts were overwhelmingly opposed to impeaching Trump , and some had directly told her so . It was her duty to represent the whole caucus , so Pelosi did what she felt she had to do as speaker : Say no to impeachment .
By Saturday morning , Pelosi informed her staff to be ready to prepare a statement endorsing an impeachment inquiry . She continued to field calls from dozens of Democrats throughout the weekend in between delivering back-to-back eulogies — first for the veteran journalist Cokie Roberts on Saturday and then for Mrs. Clyburn in South Carolina on Sunday .
Dozens of other House Democrats had also traveled to South Carolina to pay their respects to Emily , Clyburn ’ s wife of 58 years . But on the sidelines of the weekend ’ s memorial events , impeachment chatter dominated the conversations .
“ She was in regular contact with the entire spectrum of the House Democratic Caucus over the last few days , ” said House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries ( D-N.Y. ) .
Meanwhile , a thousand miles away , other Democrats were also coming to their own painful conclusions about Trump ’ s alleged behavior and what needed to be done .
For two of Minnesota 's vulnerable Democrats , the move to support impeaching Trump was a deeply personal decision made at 30,000 feet .
Rep. Dean Phillips emailed his staff to inform them he ’ d decided to endorse an impeachment inquiry while on a flight returning to Washington on Sunday . On her own D.C.-bound flight the next day , Rep. Angie Craig , who sits in a bordering district , said her thinking also crystalized mid-air .
When the two of them spoke on a panel on Capitol Hill Monday , Craig pulled Phillips aside afterward to tell him of her decision to call for an impeachment inquiry — and learned that he 'd already drafted a similar statement to release that afternoon .
Within hours , the two Minnesota freshmen became the first battleground Democrats to back impeachment following Trump ’ s own admission that he pressured Ukrainian officials to investigate Biden . It was the beginning of a wave of support that would ultimately push the number of impeachment inquiry backers in the House to a majority — 218 members — by midweek .
“ At the end of the day , I asked myself , if this were a Democratic president with exactly the same set of admissions , or behavior , would I have the courage to stand up and call for an inquiry on my own Democratic president ? ” Craig said in an interview .
In Washington , much of the attention on the shift within the caucus has focused on the seven battleground freshmen who published the op-ed on Monday night . That 427-word statement came after days of nonstop texts and conference calls among a tight-knit group of lawmakers who all have backgrounds in national security , including in the military and CIA .
“ At the end of the day , I asked myself , if this were a Democratic president with exactly the same set of admissions , or behavior , would I have the courage to stand up and call for an inquiry on my own Democratic president ? ” - Rep. Angie Craig
But Trump himself contributed to the momentum for impeachment as well . Many Democrats say it was Trump ’ s defiant comments on Sunday , directly acknowledging that he had spoken to Ukrainian officials about investigating Biden , that made lawmakers feel they could no longer ignore the situation .
Some called senior members in their state delegations and conferred with Pelosi about how to proceed . Others were deciding at home with family or out in their districts . Rep. Haley Stevens ( D-Mich. ) , who endorsed an impeachment inquiry on Tuesday , made up her mind while speaking at a Democratic picnic near a playground where she grew up .
Some freshmen were still deliberating when they returned to Washington on Tuesday , where the issue came up at a closed-door meeting of the moderate Blue Dog Coalition and resistance to impeachment lingered .
Rep. Henry Cuellar ( D-Texas ) , who survived the Democratic wipeout in the 2010 midterms , offered a warning to the undecided freshmen in the room .
`` Do n't get caught up with the party , '' the conservative Democrat cautioned . Other party elders , like Reps. Kurt Schrader ( D-Ore. ) , nodded in agreement , according to multiple people in the room .
Cuellar and Schrader are among the few remaining Blue Dogs who lived through the party ’ s humiliating defeat eight years earlier , when the moderate caucus ’ ranks were depleted by half after a series of tough votes , including on Obamacare .
This time , if Democrats were going to take a vote that could wipe them out , Cuellar said they needed to vote their conscience .
Multiple freshmen in competitive districts said that they tried to put politics aside . But they could n't entirely ignore the idea that impeachment could cost them their seat .
“ If I serve one term , and do it with honor and principle , and lose because of that , so be it . I ’ ve done my job , ” Phillips said . “ Has it crossed my mind ? Of course . But it ’ s very liberating to reflect my truth , and I think the nation ’ s truth . ”
Hours before her historic announcement on Tuesday , Pelosi received a call from Trump . The conversation was ostensibly about gun control , but Trump veered into the Ukraine controversy .
Trump then told Pelosi that he wasn ’ t personally holding up the whistleblower complaint . “ Well , then undo it , ” she told him , relaying the conversation to lawmakers later in the day .
But even after it became clear that an impeachment inquiry was inevitable , Democrats were still far from agreement over the actual mechanics of it .
Swing-district lawmakers , in particular , were actively pushing Democratic leaders to adopt an entirely new strategy from their Mueller days — one that didn ’ t involve what they saw as overly aggressive members of the House Judiciary Committee .
On Tuesday morning , a handful of Judiciary Committee members met with some of the national security-minded freshmen who wrote the op-ed the night before . The meeting was organized by Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell ( D-Fla. ) , another vulnerable freshman Democrat who also sits on the Judiciary panel .
The Judiciary members had a key goal : Convince these influential freshmen that their panel was best equipped to carry out an impeachment proceedings , rather than a select committee handpicked by party leaders , as some moderate lawmakers had been advocating for in recent days .
Still a concern of many was a circus-like hearing the week before featuring former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski , who sparred with Democrats and defiantly refused to answer questions about his role in the Mueller investigation .
Democrats privately described the showdown — the first public hearing with a Mueller-report witness — as an embarrassment , and they blamed Nadler for the mess . Pelosi herself said in a closed-door meeting that she would have held Lewandowski in contempt immediately , a comment several attendees viewed as a dig at Nadler .
Judiciary Committee members pushed back during the meeting with frontliners , arguing that they understood the gravity of the Ukraine scandal and why it was different than the myriad other investigations Democrats have been pursuing against Trump .
In fact , Democratic leaders are now coalescing around a strategy to narrow the focus of their impeachment inquiry to the Ukraine scandal , in part because it has unified the party in outrage .
In the end , the Judiciary members won out and Nadler ’ s starring role in the impeachment drive was preserved . Pelosi held a private meeting with six committee chairs on Tuesday afternoon and told them to come up with their best cases for impeachment and send them to the Judiciary Committee for potential consideration of impeachment articles .
Yet even after Pelosi helped steer the party to an impeachment inquiry , holding her members together over the next critical weeks and months could prove difficult .
A closed-door session with the full caucus on Tuesday made that clear , as some moderates complained that they weren ’ t being given a well-defined message to deliver to voters about why proceeding toward impeachment was necessary on Trump ’ s Ukraine maneuverings .
Rep. Elissa Slotkin ( D-Mich. ) was the most colorful , grousing that Democratic leaders needed to “ give us a goddamn message to stay on , ” according to lawmakers and aides in the room .
“ I think we all know we ’ re at a historic moment , ” Slotkin later told reporters . “ Obviously we have a lot of investigations already ongoing . But I think it ’ s important that we focus on this one . It ’ s clear , it ’ s understandable , it ’ s strategic , and we need to bring along the country with us . ”","Hoyer responded that he’d come to the same conclusion over the weekend following a wave of stunning news reports about Trump’s attempts to pressure Ukraine — and potentially withhold military assistance from the U.S. ally — for his own political benefit.

“The facts drove the timing and the decision,” Pelosi told POLITICO in a brief interview. “And that’s what I’ve said all along — when we get the facts, we will be ready. And we’re ready.”

Pelosi’s decision followed months of Democratic infighting. She had also faced a barrage of criticism from the party’s activist base, which had begun to question her once-impeccable progressive credentials.

That was when Rep. Cheri Bustos, an Illinois moderate who chairs the House Democrats’ campaign arm, made a pronouncement that stunned the room.

“We just need to let all this Mueller stuff go,” Bustos said, according to three sources who attended the meeting.

Bustos’ comment reflected a deepening sentiment among senior House leaders and a faction of Democratic moderates who wanted nothing to do with impeachment talk. Bustos has said publicly that she supports the House’s Mueller-related investigations, but she has also long argued that voters care more about kitchen-table issues.

But to the faction of Democrats seeking formal impeachment proceedings, Bustos’ suggestion had come at precisely the moment they needed to get more aggressive with a hostile White House. The Trump administration would soon stonewall Congress on a host of subpoenas for witnesses and documents, effectively making a mockery of lawmakers’ constitutional oversight powers.

That meeting was the beginning of a rupture that consumed the Democratic Caucus for months. It marked one of the first times Pelosi tried to walk the tightrope between the liberals who helped elect her as speaker and the moderates who delivered Democrats the House in 2018 — a delicate balancing act that became ever more difficult to manage.

It was also when Democrats who backed impeachment made a conscious choice: they weren’t going to simply fall in line with their party leaders and were going to continue organizing colleagues to join the impeachment cause.

“I believe we had enough to file articles of impeachment right after the [Mueller] report initially came out,” said Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.), one of just three lawmakers who sits on both the Judiciary and Intelligence committees.

In the weeks and months following the release of the Mueller report, pro-impeachment Democrats believed that the holdouts in the caucus were underestimating Trump’s ability to “self-impeach” through his actions and penchant to seek revenge against political enemies.

“I feel like we were indecisive and overly cautious,” said Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), an early impeachment supporter. “And frankly we did way too much political parsing when we should have taken this obvious bombshell, added it to the many other obvious impeachable bombshells that we already had, and begun doing our job.”

But the caucus was divided and the fracture was getting harder to ignore.

Pelosi and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) had been sparring for months over the issue. Just last week, Pelosi criticized the Judiciary Committee’s handling of impeachment in harsh terms behind closed doors and even encouraged people in the room to leak her complaints.

And then, just as the impeachment effort appeared to be sputtering, everything changed.

A nondescript, late-night press release from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) landed in reporters’ inboxes on Sept. 13 revealing the existence of an intelligence community whistleblower that the Trump administration had refused to let talk to Congress. Within days, the Trump-Ukraine scandal had exploded across Washington.

Pelosi Makes Her Move

The calls started rolling in to Pelosi in earnest last Friday night.

Earlier that week, the Washington Post had revealed details about a mysterious whistleblower complaint being withheld from Congress. It involved a “promise” Trump made while talking with a foreign leader.

Then a blockbuster follow-up report from the Wall Street Journal a few day later blew apart Democratic leaders’ delicately knitted attempt to hold off an impeachment investigation. The report detailed how Trump “repeatedly” pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son in a July phone call while simultaneously withholding military aide from the country.

For many Democrats, that was what was missing from previous Trump scandals. Trump was allegedly using his office to extort a foreign leader to help benefit his reelection campaign, a move that smacked of the Richard Nixon era for many in the party.

“Here we’re talking about potentially ongoing, gross abuses of power. We’re talking about a sitting president, not a candidate for president. And we’re talking about the current campaign, not a past campaign,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) said in an interview just minutes after viewing the classified whistleblower complaint in the Intelligence Committee’s underground bunker at the Capitol Wednesday night.

As the Ukraine scandal quickly ballooned, progressive activists got restless. Late Saturday night, freshman liberal Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) wrote on Twitter that Democratic leaders’ refusal to impeach Trump was “the bigger national scandal” than the president’s “lawbreaking behavior.”

But Pelosi wasn’t going to rush into any decision. She was a rising backbencher when the House impeached President Bill Clinton in 1998, and she knew that impeachment proceedings against Trump would be just as divisive to the nation.

Pelosi was also convinced that it would distract from her party’s legislative priorities on health care and drug costs, gun violence and other key issues. The Democratic domestic agenda — as well as Trump’s growing unpopularity in the suburbs — had driven the party to a huge House win in November and vaulted Pelosi back into the speaker’s chair after eight years in the minority.

The California Democrat also knew that Trump’s stranglehold over the GOP meant no Republicans were going to back impeachment unless there was an air-tight case against the president. And she feared that impeaching Trump on partisan lines was a risk to the Democratic majority.

So Pelosi took the heat from the Democratic base — and within her own caucus — over her resistance to impeachment. She at times grew exasperated by the criticism, privately clashing with some members of her leadership team while asserting publicly that Trump “isn’t even worth” impeaching.

One other important factor weighed heavily on Pelosi — her “frontline” members in the toughest swing districts were overwhelmingly opposed to impeaching Trump, and some had directly told her so. It was her duty to represent the whole caucus, so Pelosi did what she felt she had to do as speaker: Say no to impeachment.

But the Ukraine scandal upended all that.

By Saturday morning, Pelosi informed her staff to be ready to prepare a statement endorsing an impeachment inquiry. She continued to field calls from dozens of Democrats throughout the weekend in between delivering back-to-back eulogies — first for the veteran journalist Cokie Roberts on Saturday and then for Mrs. Clyburn in South Carolina on Sunday.

Dozens of other House Democrats had also traveled to South Carolina to pay their respects to Emily, Clyburn’s wife of 58 years. But on the sidelines of the weekend’s memorial events, impeachment chatter dominated the conversations.

“She was in regular contact with the entire spectrum of the House Democratic Caucus over the last few days,” said House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.).

Meanwhile, a thousand miles away, other Democrats were also coming to their own painful conclusions about Trump’s alleged behavior and what needed to be done.

‘I’ve Done My Job’

For two of Minnesota's vulnerable Democrats, the move to support impeaching Trump was a deeply personal decision made at 30,000 feet.

Rep. Dean Phillips emailed his staff to inform them he’d decided to endorse an impeachment inquiry while on a flight returning to Washington on Sunday. On her own D.C.-bound flight the next day, Rep. Angie Craig, who sits in a bordering district, said her thinking also crystalized mid-air.

When the two of them spoke on a panel on Capitol Hill Monday, Craig pulled Phillips aside afterward to tell him of her decision to call for an impeachment inquiry — and learned that he'd already drafted a similar statement to release that afternoon.

Within hours, the two Minnesota freshmen became the first battleground Democrats to back impeachment following Trump’s own admission that he pressured Ukrainian officials to investigate Biden. It was the beginning of a wave of support that would ultimately push the number of impeachment inquiry backers in the House to a majority — 218 members — by midweek.

“At the end of the day, I asked myself, if this were a Democratic president with exactly the same set of admissions, or behavior, would I have the courage to stand up and call for an inquiry on my own Democratic president?” Craig said in an interview.

In Washington, much of the attention on the shift within the caucus has focused on the seven battleground freshmen who published the op-ed on Monday night. That 427-word statement came after days of nonstop texts and conference calls among a tight-knit group of lawmakers who all have backgrounds in national security, including in the military and CIA.

“At the end of the day, I asked myself, if this were a Democratic president with exactly the same set of admissions, or behavior, would I have the courage to stand up and call for an inquiry on my own Democratic president?” - Rep. Angie Craig

But Trump himself contributed to the momentum for impeachment as well. Many Democrats say it was Trump’s defiant comments on Sunday, directly acknowledging that he had spoken to Ukrainian officials about investigating Biden, that made lawmakers feel they could no longer ignore the situation.

Some called senior members in their state delegations and conferred with Pelosi about how to proceed. Others were deciding at home with family or out in their districts. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Mich.), who endorsed an impeachment inquiry on Tuesday, made up her mind while speaking at a Democratic picnic near a playground where she grew up.

Some freshmen were still deliberating when they returned to Washington on Tuesday, where the issue came up at a closed-door meeting of the moderate Blue Dog Coalition and resistance to impeachment lingered.

Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), who survived the Democratic wipeout in the 2010 midterms, offered a warning to the undecided freshmen in the room.

""Don't get caught up with the party,"" the conservative Democrat cautioned. Other party elders, like Reps. Kurt Schrader (D-Ore.), nodded in agreement, according to multiple people in the room.

Cuellar and Schrader are among the few remaining Blue Dogs who lived through the party’s humiliating defeat eight years earlier, when the moderate caucus’ ranks were depleted by half after a series of tough votes, including on Obamacare.

This time, if Democrats were going to take a vote that could wipe them out, Cuellar said they needed to vote their conscience.

Multiple freshmen in competitive districts said that they tried to put politics aside. But they couldn't entirely ignore the idea that impeachment could cost them their seat.

“If I serve one term, and do it with honor and principle, and lose because of that, so be it. I’ve done my job,” Phillips said. “Has it crossed my mind? Of course. But it’s very liberating to reflect my truth, and I think the nation’s truth.”

‘Give Us A Goddamn Message’

Hours before her historic announcement on Tuesday, Pelosi received a call from Trump. The conversation was ostensibly about gun control, but Trump veered into the Ukraine controversy.

Trump then told Pelosi that he wasn’t personally holding up the whistleblower complaint. “Well, then undo it,” she told him, relaying the conversation to lawmakers later in the day.

But even after it became clear that an impeachment inquiry was inevitable, Democrats were still far from agreement over the actual mechanics of it.

Swing-district lawmakers, in particular, were actively pushing Democratic leaders to adopt an entirely new strategy from their Mueller days — one that didn’t involve what they saw as overly aggressive members of the House Judiciary Committee.

On Tuesday morning, a handful of Judiciary Committee members met with some of the national security-minded freshmen who wrote the op-ed the night before. The meeting was organized by Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell (D-Fla.), another vulnerable freshman Democrat who also sits on the Judiciary panel.

The Judiciary members had a key goal: Convince these influential freshmen that their panel was best equipped to carry out an impeachment proceedings, rather than a select committee handpicked by party leaders, as some moderate lawmakers had been advocating for in recent days.

Still a concern of many was a circus-like hearing the week before featuring former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, who sparred with Democrats and defiantly refused to answer questions about his role in the Mueller investigation.

Democrats privately described the showdown — the first public hearing with a Mueller-report witness — as an embarrassment, and they blamed Nadler for the mess. Pelosi herself said in a closed-door meeting that she would have held Lewandowski in contempt immediately, a comment several attendees viewed as a dig at Nadler.

Judiciary Committee members pushed back during the meeting with frontliners, arguing that they understood the gravity of the Ukraine scandal and why it was different than the myriad other investigations Democrats have been pursuing against Trump.

In fact, Democratic leaders are now coalescing around a strategy to narrow the focus of their impeachment inquiry to the Ukraine scandal, in part because it has unified the party in outrage.

In the end, the Judiciary members won out and Nadler’s starring role in the impeachment drive was preserved. Pelosi held a private meeting with six committee chairs on Tuesday afternoon and told them to come up with their best cases for impeachment and send them to the Judiciary Committee for potential consideration of impeachment articles.

Yet even after Pelosi helped steer the party to an impeachment inquiry, holding her members together over the next critical weeks and months could prove difficult.

A closed-door session with the full caucus on Tuesday made that clear, as some moderates complained that they weren’t being given a well-defined message to deliver to voters about why proceeding toward impeachment was necessary on Trump’s Ukraine maneuverings.

Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) was the most colorful, grousing that Democratic leaders needed to “give us a goddamn message to stay on,” according to lawmakers and aides in the room.

“I think we all know we’re at a historic moment,” Slotkin later told reporters. “Obviously we have a lot of investigations already ongoing. But I think it’s important that we focus on this one. It’s clear, it’s understandable, it’s strategic, and we need to bring along the country with us.”

The Senate took some of its first steps on Thursday to prepare for next week's impeachment trial of President Trump, just the third such trial in Senate history.

Like many congressional activities, the process begins with much pomp and circumstance and procedure and process. But little of substance will be achieved until the case for impeachment is presented next week.

First though, there are some housekeeping measures, including the swearing-in ceremony. Chief Justice John Roberts, having crossed First Street from the Supreme Court building over to the Capitol, joined senators in the chamber and then was sworn in himself by Senate President pro tempore Chuck Grassley of Iowa. Roberts will preside over the trial.

Roberts then swore in the senators to act as jurors.

Earlier in the afternoon, the seven House managers named by Speaker Nancy Pelosi gathered in the Senate chamber, where the lead manager, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., formally read the resolution appointing them and the two articles of impeachment approved by the House last month.

Watch that presentation.

Senate rules say the president still needs to be summoned and given a chance to respond. President Trump will be primarily represented by two attorneys, White House counsel Pat Cipollone and Jay Sekulow, a private attorney who represented Trump in the Russia investigation.

But that is expected to be the extent of the ""action"" this week. Senators will likely head home for the Martin Luther King Jr. Day weekend, and the essence of the trial will get under way next Tuesday.

Senators may chafe at some of the conditions they'll have to deal with once that happens. They are expected to be seated at their desks and will have to refrain from talking to one another during the arguments.

They'll need to rise when Chief Justice Roberts enters and exits the chamber, and should votes occur, they'll have to stand then, too.

WASHINGTON -- A top aide to President Obama said it's possible that Obama could be impeached by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.

House Speaker John Boehner's decision to proceed with a lawsuit against the president has ""opened the door"" to the third presidential impeachment in the nation's history, Senior Adviser Dan Pfeiffer told reporters at a Friday breakfast sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor.

""Impeachment is a very serious thing that has been bandied about by the recent Republican vice presidential nominee and others in a very un-serious way,"" he said, referring to former Alaska governor Sarah Palin. ""We take it very seriously and I don't think it would be a good thing.""

Pfeiffer was quick to add that ""no one has alleged anything that is even six universes from what is generally considered"" to be an impeachable offense.

Boehner has dismissed calls for Obama to be impeached. His spokesman, Michael Steel, called Pfeiffer's comments ""a fundraising exercise for Democrats.""

""We have a humanitarian crisis at our border, and the White House is making matters worse with inattention and mixed signals,"" Steel said. ""It is telling, and sad, that a senior White House official is focused on political games, rather than helping these kids and securing the border.""

Later, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said ""prominent voices in the Republican party"" have called for impeachment, but was hard-pressed to name one other than Palin. ""I think there are some Republicans, including some Republicans that are running for office, hoping that they can get into office so they can impeach the president,"" he said.

A CNN/ORC poll released Friday shows 35% of Americans favor impeachment, which is about the same support for efforts to impeach Presidents Clinton and George W. Bush. Pfeiffer noted that a majority of Republicans -- 57% -- favor impeaching Obama.

Impeachment is the bringing of charges against a president or federal judge by the House of Representatives. A president can only be removed after a trial on those charges by the Senate.

Boehner has chosen a less drastic approach with a plan to sue Obama over his decision to delay enforcement of a provision in the Affordable Care Act requiring employers to provide health insurance. That plan passed the House Rules Committee Thursday, clearing the way for a vote on the House floor.

Pfeiffer said the lawsuit won't have an impact on how the president uses his executive authority. In fact, he said, the threat of lawsuits validates that Obama's executive actions are ""far from the small ball that some have accused it of being.""

The White House is pushing back against the publication of a book by former national security adviser John Bolton, citing security concerns.

The National Security Council said the book had ""top secret"" details that must be removed, a claim Mr Bolton rejects.

A manuscript of the book reportedly claims that President Donald Trump linked freezing military aid to Ukraine in exchange for a political favour.

The book row comes as the questioning period of the impeachment trial begins.

On Friday, senators will hold a key vote on whether or not to allow witnesses in the trial. Democrats are demanding Mr Bolton testify in the wake of these claims, and some Republicans have also suggested they would like to hear from the former adviser.

The president has denied all the allegations against him.

What did the White House say?

National Security Council (NSC) senior director Ellen Knight said in a letter to Mr Bolton's attorney that following a preliminary review, the ""manuscript appears to contain significant amounts of classified information"".

""It also appears that some of this classified information is at the top-secret level,"" Ms Knight wrote. She went on to warn that the ""manuscript may not be published or otherwise disclosed without the deletion of this classified information"".

A senior White House official said on Wednesday that the letter was not a ""threat"" to the former national security adviser. But President Trump's defence in his impeachment trial has been imperilled by the reported revelations in the book.

A copy of Mr Bolton's manuscript was reportedly sent to the White House weeks ago for review. A White House official said the letter was sent to Mr Bolton prior to revelations from his book being reported by the New York Times last week.

The president lashed out at his former national security adviser on Twitter on Wednesday, calling his book ""nasty & untrue"". He insisted he ""NEVER"" told John Bolton the military aid was tied to getting dirt from Ukraine on his domestic political rivals.

What does the Bolton manuscript allege?

On 26 January, the New York Times reported excerpts from the unpublished book by Mr Bolton, who was fired from the White House in September 2019.

They included claims that Mr Trump told Mr Bolton in August that he wanted to withhold $391m (£300 million) in security aid to Ukraine until officials there assisted with probes into Democrats, including 2020 Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden and his son.

The revelations, if true, are significant, because Republicans have argued that no first-hand witnesses had connected the president to the alleged scheme to withhold aid for political benefit.

Mr Cooper also said he had asked for an expedited review of a chapter about Ukraine, adding that Mr Bolton was ""preparing"" for the possibility he could be called to testify in the trial.

What's happening in the trial?

The Senate impeachment trial has entered a two-day period of questioning, during which each party will alternate for up to 16 hours throughout Wednesday and Thursday.

Lawmakers are barred from speaking themselves, and must submit written questions to Chief Justice John Roberts, who then reads them aloud.

In one key moment on Wednesday, Trump attorney Alan Dershowitz argued that ""if a president does something which he believes will help him get elected in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment"" - effectively arguing that any action taken to aid re-election could be considered to be in the public interest, and therefore not impeachable.

A vote on whether or not to call witnesses in the trial is expected on Friday. A vote on the articles of impeachment themselves could follow immediately after if witnesses are blocked.

Four Republicans would be required to vote with the Democrats to reach the necessary majority to call witnesses. Several more moderate senators have appeared more prepared to do so in the wake of the Bolton book reports.
