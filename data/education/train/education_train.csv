A few months ago, when I told friends and media colleagues that I was interested in the Common Core State Standards, the most common response was ""What's that?""

Now, it seems, everyone has an opinion about the Core.

And right now, opinions about the K-12 learning goals for math and English that have spread nearly nationwide are trending toward the heated.

While the school year is winding down, education policy sure isn't. This past week brought a bunch of front-page news on the Common Core.

One of these events was an announcement by Dunbar High School in Washington , D.C. , that it plans on August 19th to begin `` an entire week of activities to celebrate the grand opening of our new $ 160 million state-of-the-art school building . ''
The painful irony in all this is that the original Dunbar High School building , which opened in 1916 , housed a school with a record of high academic achievements for generations of black students , despite the inadequacies of the building and the inadequacies of the financial support that the school received .
By contrast , today 's Dunbar High School is just another ghetto school with abysmal standards , despite Washington 's record of having some of the country 's highest levels of money spent per pupil -- and some of the lowest test score results .
Housing an educational disaster in an expensive new building is all too typical of what political incentives produce .
We pay a lot of lip service to educational excellence . But too many institutions and individuals that have produced good educational results for minority students have not only failed to get support , but have even been undermined .
A recent example on the west coast is a charter school operation in Oakland called the American Indian Model Schools . The high school part of this operation has been ranked among the best high schools in the nation . Its students ' test scores rank first in its district and fourth in the state of California .
But the California State Board of Education announced plans to shut down this charter school -- immediately . Its students would have had to attend inferior public schools this September , except that a challenge in court stopped this sudden shutdown .
Why such a hurry to take drastic action ? Because of a claim of financial improprieties against the charter schools ' founder and former head , Ben Chavis .
Ben Chavis has not been found guilty of anything in a court of law . Nor has he even been brought to trial , though that would seem to be the normal thing to do if the charges were serious .
More important , the children have not been accused of anything . Nor is there any reason for urgency in immediately depriving them of an excellent education they are not likely to get in their local public schools .
What Ben Chavis and the American Indian Model Schools are really guilty of is creating academic excellence that shows up the public school system , both by this school 's achievements and by the methods used to create those achievements , which go against the educational dogmas prevailing in the failing public schools .
If it seems strange that there would be a vendetta against an educator who has defied the education establishment and thereby improved the education of minority students , the fact is that Ben Chavis is only the latest in a long line of educators who have done just that -- and aroused animosity , and even vindictiveness , as a result .
Washington 's former public school head , Michelle Rhee , raised test scores in that city 's school system and was demonized by the education establishment and politicians . She has left .
Years ago , high school math teacher Jaime Escalante , whose success in teaching Mexican American students was celebrated in the movie Stand and Deliver , was eventually hounded out of Garfield High School in Los Angeles . Yet , while he was there , about one-fourth of all Mexican American students -- in the entire country -- who passed Advanced Placement Calculus came from that one school .
Marva Collins , who established a very successful private school for black children in Chicago , doing so on a shoestring , was likewise the target of hostility when she was a dedicated teacher in the public schools .

Tuition revenues now make up about half of public university revenues , up from a quarter 25 years ago . And with colleges facing larger pensions , health care and technology costs , the pressure to keep raising tuition is intense .
The average borrower now graduates with more than $ 26,000 of debt . Loan default rates are rising , and only about half of those who start college graduate within six years .
Mr. Obama has focused on these concerns for some time , exhorting colleges and universities , and state legislators , to make higher education more affordable .
In his 2012 State of the Union address , he said he was putting colleges on notice that if tuition did not stop rising faster than inflation , financing from taxpayers would drop . And in this year ’ s State of the Union speech , he urged Congress to consider affordability and value in awarding federal aid , and followed up with a policy plan recommending that those measures be incorporated into the accreditation system .
Mr. Obama ’ s proposal urges colleges to experiment with approaches that reduce costs . The plan mentions so-called competency-based degrees , in which college credits are based not on the hours students spend in classrooms , but on how much they can show they know .
Another approach mentioned in the plan is online education through what have become known as “ massive open online courses , ” or MOOCs , which are mostly free . Mr. Obama also urged consideration of three-year degree programs and dual enrollment programs in which high school students can begin to earn college credits .

At the same time , charter schools have come under attack from some Democrats . The resurgent liberal wing of the Democratic Party has become skeptical of the competitive and market-driven models behind the charter school movement . And lawmakers in states including New York and Michigan , as well as a number of cities , have begun to scale back commitments to innovative charter ideas .
Many in the public charter school movement were stunned last month to see the Trump administration ’ s most recent budget proposal , which eliminated the 26-year-old federal Charter Schools Program that helped jump-start such schools . While not opposing charters per se , the administration has outlined scaled-back block grants that allow states to use federal education dollars as they see fit . A portion of the block grants would go toward the proposed Education Freedom Scholarships program , designed to give families access to private and religious schools .
While charter schools have been a centerpiece of education reform in the United States for nearly 30 years , their supporters have suddenly found themselves buffeted by forces from both the left and right .
Throughout his career as an expert in education policy and public charter schools , Matthew Ladner has championed the core idea that families should have a wider range of choices as they seek to find the best schools for their children .
But the Arizona-based reformer admits he ’ s probably in the minority of charter school advocates who also champion another side of school choice policy , the effort to expand state-funded vouchers and tax credits for families who want to send their children to private and religious schools .
Many of Mr. Ladner ’ s peers are wary of the politically charged voucher movement , long a priority of religious conservatives , and argue they should keep their distance , focusing more on expanding choice within public education . As he sees it , though , “ charters have 99 problems , but private choice is not one of them . ”
“ The fact of the matter is that charter schools are under assault , ” says Mr. Ladner , director of the Arizona Center for Student Opportunity at the Arizona Charter Schools Association . “ We are starting to have too few friends , not too many . In a big-tent movement there ’ s always going to be tensions , and there ’ s going to be spats , but at the end of the day , the private-choice people are not an enemy at all . ”
Not too long ago , policy experts often called charter schools the last remaining bipartisan issue , noting how Democrats and Republicans , including the administrations of Bill Clinton , George W. Bush , and especially Barack Obama , made expanding charter schools a significant part of their education policies .
Yet while charter schools have been a centerpiece of education reform in the United States for nearly 30 years , their supporters have found themselves buffeted by forces from both the left and right , observers say .
Last month , many in the public charter school movement were stunned to see the Trump administration ’ s most recent budget proposal , which eliminated the 26-year-old federal Charter Schools Program that helped jump-start such schools . While not opposing charters per se , the administration – including Education Secretary Betsy DeVos , a longtime school choice advocate – has proposed scaled-back block grants that allow states to use their federal education dollars as they see fit .
“ The Trump administration has consistently said that school choice is a priority , but this budget doesn ’ t demonstrate that , ” says Harry Lee , president of the New Jersey Charter Schools Association . “ Instead , there ’ s this move to these Education Freedom Scholarships , giving tax credits which would essentially help families access private and religious schools . ”
Few expect Congress to pass this budget proposal , but it represents a dramatic shift in the administration ’ s priorities , observers say . Instead of charters , a portion of its proposed $ 19.4 billion in block grants is specifically allocated to this $ 5 billion scholarship program .
Ross D. Franklin/AP U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos smiles as she is applauded by Arizona Gov . Doug Ducey during a roundtable discussion on school choice Dec. 5 , 2019 , in Scottsdale , Arizona . Ms. DeVos is a longtime school choice advocate .
The Trump administration says the elimination of the Charter Schools Program does not mean it opposes such schools , only that it prefers to let the states decide how they spend their federal funds .
“ There is a mountain of evidence that charter schools help students succeed and very high parental demand for spots in charter schools , ” says Angela Morabito , press secretary for the U.S. Department of Education , in an email . “ We believe states know this , and we fully expect that innovative states would continue sending federal dollars to public charter schools . States may even choose to send more federal dollars to them . ”
The shift in Republican priorities comes at a time when charter schools have come under attack from liberal Democrats who have also sought to curtail , if not eliminate , the long-standing federal program supporting charter schools .
The resurgent liberal wing of the Democratic Party has become skeptical of the competitive and market-driven models behind the charter school movement . Lawmakers in states such as California , New York , and Michigan , as well as a number of cities that have been leaders in crafting a range of innovative charter schools , have begun to scale back their commitments to such ideas .
“ Charters have evolved from their original concept as small incubators of innovation , ” says Lily Eskelsen García , president of the National Education Association , in an email . “ We now find that too frequently charters are operated expressly for profit , or are nominally non-profit but managed or operated by for-profit entities . ”
In many ways , charter schools have become ensnared in a growing clash of civic values , observers say , as many on the left start to emphasize egalitarian and secular ideals to combat the inequities in American education . Many on the right , on the other hand , have emphasized a choice-based pluralism that has begun to focus more on religious liberty and support for families choosing private options in education .
“ I just think that the more choices parents have the better , whether they ’ re in the form of private choice or public choice or both , ” says Erica Smith , a senior attorney at the Institute for Justice , a libertarian law firm that has been at the center of a legal battle to expand vouchers and tax credits for private schools . “ We just think competition makes this all better . ”
Over two dozen states offer some form of voucher or tax-credit programs for private school choice , and most are directed to low-income and minority communities . But some states forbid these from being used for religious schools , and at least 37 states have so-called Blaine amendments on their books , which prevent any kind of government funding for religious purposes .
But that could change this year . Ms. Smith is co-counsel in a Montana case before the U.S. Supreme Court challenging the legal barriers that thwart the kinds of tax credit programs that can support private and religious schools – programs similar to the Education Freedom Scholarships being proposed by the Trump administration .
Both supporters and critics agree that this case , Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue , could create a “ virtual earthquake ” in the nation ’ s public education landscape .
“ What ’ s at stake in Espinoza is , if we win this case , tens of thousands of children , perhaps hundreds of thousands , will finally have access to educational choice programs , ” Ms. Smith says .
The debate over vouchers and tax credits has become an epic constitutional battle over the meaning of the First Amendment ’ s establishment clause and the separation of church and state , many experts say . But liberal educators also see the broader effects of the school choice movement as a threat to the ideals of equal opportunity and universal public education .
“ Simply put , vouchers do not ensure that all of our students have access to the opportunities and resources they need and deserve , ” says Ms. Eskelsen García . “ These voucher [ and tax credit ] proposals divert already scarce funding away from neighborhood public schools – where 90 percent of children go – and give it away to private schools , which are not accountable to taxpayers . ”
There are some 7,000 charter schools across the 43 states with programs , as well as the District of Columbia , and they serve about 3.2 million students – about 6 % of K-12 public schools , researchers say . About 5.8 million K-12 students attend private schools , according to the National Center for Education Statistics .
When it comes to successful outcomes , researchers see a lot of variability , especially on the charter side of the school choice movement .
“ We know there ’ s a lot of variation , ” says Mark Berends , director of the Center for Research on Educational Opportunity at the University of Notre Dame , who is conducting a school-choice research project in Indiana . “ We know there ’ s some charter schools that are doing really excellent things in terms of developing students , and then there ’ s some charter schools that probably should be shut down . ”
Mr. Lee , who heads the charter school association in New Jersey , points out that communities of color are often far more supportive of school choice than white liberals , who have become warier of the charter school movement .
“ Poll after poll demonstrates that African American families , Latino families support additional public charter school options , while wealthy white families don ’ t , ” he says .
Indeed , about half of black people and Latinos express support for charter schools , according to Education Next , a Harvard University-based journal . Support from white Democrats , however , fell from 43 % to 27 % between 2016 and 2018 .
“ It ’ s interesting because no one ever complains about the old-fashioned kinds of school choice , ” says Mr. Ladner of the Arizona Charter Schools Association . “ We always have had and always will have school choice for the wealthy . ”
“ So the real question is not , ‘ Will we have school choice ? ’ but rather , ‘ Who will get to exercise choice ? ’ ” he says . “ What mechanisms like charter schools and private choice programs do is to allow a much broader segment of society to exercise that choice . ”","As Matthew Ladner of the Arizona Charter Schools Association puts it, “The fact of the matter is that charter schools are under assault.”

At the same time, charter schools have come under attack from some Democrats. The resurgent liberal wing of the Democratic Party has become skeptical of the competitive and market-driven models behind the charter school movement.

Yet while charter schools have been a centerpiece of education reform in the United States for nearly 30 years, their supporters have found themselves buffeted by forces from both the left and right, observers say.

The Trump administration’s proposal

Last month, many in the public charter school movement were stunned to see the Trump administration’s most recent budget proposal, which eliminated the 26-year-old federal Charter Schools Program that helped jump-start such schools. While not opposing charters per se, the administration – including Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, a longtime school choice advocate – has proposed scaled-back block grants that allow states to use their federal education dollars as they see fit.

“The Trump administration has consistently said that school choice is a priority, but this budget doesn’t demonstrate that,” says Harry Lee, president of the New Jersey Charter Schools Association. “Instead, there’s this move to these Education Freedom Scholarships, giving tax credits which would essentially help families access private and religious schools.”

Few expect Congress to pass this budget proposal, but it represents a dramatic shift in the administration’s priorities, observers say. Instead of charters, a portion of its proposed $19.4 billion in block grants is specifically allocated to this $5 billion scholarship program.

Ross D. Franklin/AP U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos smiles as she is applauded by Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey during a roundtable discussion on school choice Dec. 5, 2019, in Scottsdale, Arizona. Ms. DeVos is a longtime school choice advocate.

The Trump administration says the elimination of the Charter Schools Program does not mean it opposes such schools, only that it prefers to let the states decide how they spend their federal funds.

“There is a mountain of evidence that charter schools help students succeed and very high parental demand for spots in charter schools,” says Angela Morabito, press secretary for the U.S. Department of Education, in an email. “We believe states know this, and we fully expect that innovative states would continue sending federal dollars to public charter schools. States may even choose to send more federal dollars to them.”

The shift in Republican priorities comes at a time when charter schools have come under attack from liberal Democrats who have also sought to curtail, if not eliminate, the long-standing federal program supporting charter schools.

The resurgent liberal wing of the Democratic Party has become skeptical of the competitive and market-driven models behind the charter school movement. Lawmakers in states such as California, New York, and Michigan, as well as a number of cities that have been leaders in crafting a range of innovative charter schools, have begun to scale back their commitments to such ideas.

“Charters have evolved from their original concept as small incubators of innovation,” says Lily Eskelsen García, president of the National Education Association, in an email. “We now find that too frequently charters are operated expressly for profit, or are nominally non-profit but managed or operated by for-profit entities.”

In many ways, charter schools have become ensnared in a growing clash of civic values, observers say, as many on the left start to emphasize egalitarian and secular ideals to combat the inequities in American education. Many on the right, on the other hand, have emphasized a choice-based pluralism that has begun to focus more on religious liberty and support for families choosing private options in education.

“I just think that the more choices parents have the better, whether they’re in the form of private choice or public choice or both,” says Erica Smith, a senior attorney at the Institute for Justice, a libertarian law firm that has been at the center of a legal battle to expand vouchers and tax credits for private schools. “We just think competition makes this all better.”

Over two dozen states offer some form of voucher or tax-credit programs for private school choice, and most are directed to low-income and minority communities. But some states forbid these from being used for religious schools, and at least 37 states have so-called Blaine amendments on their books, which prevent any kind of government funding for religious purposes.

Supreme Court case

But that could change this year. Ms. Smith is co-counsel in a Montana case before the U.S. Supreme Court challenging the legal barriers that thwart the kinds of tax credit programs that can support private and religious schools – programs similar to the Education Freedom Scholarships being proposed by the Trump administration.

Both supporters and critics agree that this case, Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue, could create a “virtual earthquake” in the nation’s public education landscape.

“What’s at stake in Espinoza is, if we win this case, tens of thousands of children, perhaps hundreds of thousands, will finally have access to educational choice programs,” Ms. Smith says.

The debate over vouchers and tax credits has become an epic constitutional battle over the meaning of the First Amendment’s establishment clause and the separation of church and state, many experts say. But liberal educators also see the broader effects of the school choice movement as a threat to the ideals of equal opportunity and universal public education.

“Simply put, vouchers do not ensure that all of our students have access to the opportunities and resources they need and deserve,” says Ms. Eskelsen García. “These voucher [and tax credit] proposals divert already scarce funding away from neighborhood public schools – where 90 percent of children go – and give it away to private schools, which are not accountable to taxpayers.”

There are some 7,000 charter schools across the 43 states with programs, as well as the District of Columbia, and they serve about 3.2 million students – about 6% of K-12 public schools, researchers say. About 5.8 million K-12 students attend private schools, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.

When it comes to successful outcomes, researchers see a lot of variability, especially on the charter side of the school choice movement.

“We know there’s a lot of variation,” says Mark Berends, director of the Center for Research on Educational Opportunity at the University of Notre Dame, who is conducting a school-choice research project in Indiana. “We know there’s some charter schools that are doing really excellent things in terms of developing students, and then there’s some charter schools that probably should be shut down.”

Families supporting charters

Mr. Lee, who heads the charter school association in New Jersey, points out that communities of color are often far more supportive of school choice than white liberals, who have become warier of the charter school movement.

“Poll after poll demonstrates that African American families, Latino families support additional public charter school options, while wealthy white families don’t,” he says.

Indeed, about half of black people and Latinos express support for charter schools, according to Education Next, a Harvard University-based journal. Support from white Democrats, however, fell from 43% to 27% between 2016 and 2018.

“It’s interesting because no one ever complains about the old-fashioned kinds of school choice,” says Mr. Ladner of the Arizona Charter Schools Association. “We always have had and always will have school choice for the wealthy.”

“So the real question is not, ‘Will we have school choice?’ but rather, ‘Who will get to exercise choice?’” he says. “What mechanisms like charter schools and private choice programs do is to allow a much broader segment of society to exercise that choice.”

The modern liberal’s quest for victims is never ending. He sees criminals as victims of poverty. Looters loot because society’s racism made them do it. Obesity is caused by sugary snacks, not overeating. For all life’s problems, something else is to blame. The latest fall guy is home schooling.

This became clear last week as the state advisory committee investigating the Sandy Hook elementary-school shooting in Newtown, Conn., met to discuss “gun safety” recommendations. Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, a Democrat, convened the panel to exploit the tragedy and take guns away from law-abiding residents.

By the left’s reckoning, madman Adam Lanza, 20, opened fire on students and teachers because Connecticut’s gun-control regime, already the second-strictest in the nation, didn’t go far enough. So Mr. Malloy imposed universal background checks, firearm storage requirements and restrictions on the size of magazines, turning thousands of law-abiding Nutmeg State gun owners into criminals overnight.

The 16-member Sandy Hook Advisory Commission consisting of government officials, mental health activists and politicians chosen by the governor saw an opportunity to expand their inquiry into education. Task force bureaucrats reason that Lanza has emotional and behavioral issues and was partially home-schooled by his mother, therefore thousands of other families seeking alternatives to public schooling should be subject to heightened government scrutiny.

“We need a holistic approach,” explained Susan R. Schmeiser, a University of Connecticut Law School professor and commission member, “that will follow children from birth to adulthood … . Home schooling … may not adequately address those children’s needs or help them develop the skills they will need to function in society.”

The commission members insist that government must get more involved in raising children by requiring parents to file detailed plans with local officials. “Continuation of home schooling should be contingent on approval,” said Ms. Schmeiser.

Instead of, say, looking for signs of violent behavior, the task force thinks the best way to identify the next shooter is to monitor “school connectedness” and “school engagement.” The kids who don’t join the booster club will surely be the next to snap.

One flaw with this convenient theory is that Lanza was no stranger to Connecticut’s school system. He attended public schools all the way through 10th grade when his mother pulled him out. Lanza completed his degree with a combination of home schooling by his mother, classes at Newtown High and classes at Western Connecticut State University, where he studied computer science, American history and economics.

Facts are of secondary importance when there’s an opportunity to accomplish long-sought goals. The teachers unions can’t stand home schooling because the kids who are educated by “amateurs” tend to score higher on achievement tests. Using a “gun violence” task force to crack down on the practice would be a dream come true. Patricia Keavney-Maruca, a representative from the state board of education, cautioned that “it may be hard to implement [the home-schooling recommendation] because parents may get their backs up.”

That’s an understatement. America’s nearly 2 million home-schooling families won’t take kindly to bureaucrats attempting to drag them into a tragedy in which they were not involved in any way. Unlike the public schools, home-schooling parents instill values like personal responsibility in their children. These parents ought to let Mr. Malloy know they’re not going to play along with his victimization scheme.

education,Christian Science Monitor,1,http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Education/2013/1023/College-costs-rising-more-slowly-but-aid-still-not-keeping-up-reports-say,"College costs rising more slowly, but aid still not keeping up, reports say",2013-10-23,Amanda Paulson,"The spiraling rise of both college costs and student debt has slowed , according to a new report from the College Board . But even though costs aren ’ t rising as steeply as they were , they are still rising , and the failure of aid to keep pace with tuition increases means that the net cost students pay for college continues to go up .
That ’ s one conclusion from the 30th annual `` Trends in College Pricing '' and `` Trends in College Aid '' reports the College Board released Wednesday . Taken together , the comprehensive reports provide not just a snapshot at how both tuition and student aid are shifting in the most recent year – in which they have been under scrutiny by policymakers determined to make college more affordable – but also how they ’ ve changed over the past three decades .
“ The rapid increases in published college prices have slowed , ” says College Board President David Coleman . “ However , students and their families are paying more because grant aid hasn ’ t kept up. ” Still , despite the rising costs , Mr. Coleman emphasizes that a college education – as evidenced in another recent College Board report , `` Education Pays '' – is worth it . “ I do not want to diminish the real concern around student debt and the price of college , ” Coleman says . “ But a college education is one of the best investments students and their families can make in terms of health , income , and upward mobility . ”
Among the key findings from this year 's “ Trends ” reports are the following :
• Published tuition and fees for in-state students at public four-year colleges increased 2.9 percent from 2012-13 to 2013-14 – the smallest one-year increase since 1975-76 . After adjusting for inflation , the increase is 0.9 percent , the lowest inflation-adjusted increase since 2000-01 .
• Between 2010-11 and 2012-13 , federal grant aid declined – a major reason that net prices rose for families . Because of earlier increases in aid , the average net price for full-time students attending in-state , public four-year colleges actually fell by $ 650 ( in 2013 dollars ) between 2008-09 and 2009-10 , but between 2009-10 and 2013-14 it increased from $ 1,940 to $ 3,120 .
• Over the decade from 2002-03 to 2012-13 , the total number of federal undergraduate and graduate student loan borrowers increased by 69 percent , and the average annual amount borrowed increased by 6 percent , from $ 7,900 ( in 2012 dollars ) in 2002-03 to $ 8,350 . In 2012-13 , the average undergraduate federal loan was $ 6,760 , and the average graduate student loan was $ 17,230 .
• Total Pell Grant expenditures peaked at $ 37.5 billion in 2010-11 ( in 2012 dollars ) and declined to $ 32.3 billion by 2012-13 . Both the average grant and the number of recipients were lower in 2012-13 than in 2010-11 .
Part of the affordability problem is that family income has fallen even as prices for college have risen , says Sandy Baum , co-author of the Trends reports . After adjusted for inflation , real income at all levels of the income distribution were lower in 2012 than they were in 2002 , and at the bottom quintile , family income declined by 13 percent in that decade .
Ms. Baum said the College Board focused the hardest on the “ net price ” students pay , since most students have access to some form of aid or tax credits , but says that “ the news in terms of the college price increase is that it does seem that the spiral is moderating… . Price increases are moderating , and financial aid is still there , but it ’ s not increasing at the rate it would have to to cushion students from the rate increases . ”
The report also highlights the vast differences between states , both in how much they charge for tuition – and how much the state subsidizes that tuition – and in how they grant their aid .
South Carolina and Georgia , for instance , are the most generous with their grant aid per full-time student . But in Georgia , none of that aid is needs-based , and in South Carolina , only 16 percent of the state grand aid was needs-based .
And in 2013-14 , published tuition and fees for in-state students at flagship universities range from $ 4,404 a year at the University of Wyoming to $ 17,926 at Penn State-University Park .
“ There are dramatic differences depending on where you live , ” says Baum .
In 2012-13 , 49 percent of all student aid was in the form of grants – the highest percentage over the past decade . But many students are still borrowing . Some 60 percent of students who earned bachelor ’ s degrees in 2011-12 from the public and private nonprofit institutions at which they began their studies graduated with debt , borrowing an average of $ 26,500 . Some 1.6 million students are in income-based repayment plans – about 11 percent of borrowers .
The College Board has published the trends on both college pricing and student aid and borrowing annually for 30 years now , but this year , the reports come at a time of increased attention to the college affordability problem .
In August , President Obama drew attention to the problem and called for a new college ranking system that would emphasize things like graduation rates and sticker price as a means to help make colleges more affordable .
`` We ’ re going to start rating colleges not just by which college is the most selective , not just by which college is the most expensive , not just by which college has the nicest facilities – you can get all of that on the existing rating systems . What we want to do is rate them on who 's offering the best value so students and taxpayers get a bigger bang for their buck , ” Mr. Obama said in a speech last month at the University of Buffalo , in New York .
Numerous people , including a number of colleges , have pushed back against that proposal – and it remains unlikely that this Congress would agree to tie federal student aid to such a system – but most people agree that spiraling college costs and student debt are a problem .
The latest data from the Trends reports , says Baum , show that “ there aren ’ t any magic bullets here. ” What ’ s needed , she and Coleman say , is to be thinking more about appropriately targeting student aid for those who need it most , having adequate public funding for higher education , and providing better guidance for students trying to navigate the complex decisions involved . Often the least information is available to the students who need it most , they say , and the College Board is working to get better information to low-income students .
But they also emphasize the value , despite the rising costs , that a college education still gives students – and worry that the current discussion about the danger of taking on debt will discourage some students from getting that education , particularly those with the least access to good information , or who don ’ t have family members who have gone to college .
“ It is imperative that we provide the best information possible to students and their families about the value of a college education and what debt really means , ” says Coleman , noting that the average debt for a bachelor ’ s degree recipient is $ 26,500 – which could be repaid in 10 years by payments of less than $ 300 per month . But studies show that an average bachelor ’ s degree recipient can expect to earn an extra $ 550,000 to $ 600,000 in income in his or her lifetime compared with those who do not , he says . “ I don ’ t diminish the real concerns about the price of college , but it is a moral and social imperative that we ’ re clear about the truth . ”","The spiraling rise of both college costs and student debt has slowed, according to a new report from the College Board.

education,Fox News,2,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/04/29/states-spending-less-per-child-on-pre-kindergarten-programs-report-finds/,"States spending less per child on pre-kindergarten programs, report finds",2013-04-29,,"State funding for pre-kindergarten programs had its largest drop ever last year and states are now spending less per child than they did a decade ago , according to a report released Monday .
The report also found that more than a half million of those preschool students are in programs that do n't even meet standards suggested by industry experts that would qualify for federal dollars .
Those findings — combined with Congress ' reluctance to spend new dollars — complicate President Barack Obama 's effort to expand pre-K programs across the country . While Education Secretary Arne Duncan and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius continue to promote the president 's proposal , researchers say existing programs are inadequate , and until their shortcomings are fixed there is little desire by lawmakers to get behind Obama 's call for more preschool .
`` The state of preschool was a state of emergency , '' said Steven Barnett , director of the National Institute for Early Education Research at Rutgers University , which produced the report .
During his State of the Union speech , Obama proposed a federal-state partnership that would dramatically expand options for families with young children . Obama 's plan would fund public preschool for any 4-year-old whose family income was below twice the federal poverty rate .
If it were in place this year , the plan would allow a family of four with two children to enroll students in a pre-K program if the family earned less than $ 46,566 .
Students from families who earn more could participate in the program , but their parents would have to pay tuition based on their income . Eventually , 3-year-old students would be part of the program , too .
As part of his budget request , Obama proposed spending $ 75 billion over 10 years to help states get these new programs up and running . During the first years , Washington would pick up the majority of the cost before shifting costs to states .
`` It 's the most significant opportunity to expand access to pre-K that this nation has ever seen , '' Barnett said of the president 's proposal .
Obama proposed paying for this expansion by almost doubling the federal tax on cigarettes , to $ 1.95 per pack .
Obama 's pre-K plan faces a tough uphill climb , though , with the tobacco industry opposing the tax that would pay for it and lawmakers from tobacco-producing states also skeptical . Conservative lawmakers have balked at starting another government program , as well . Obama 's Democratic allies are clamoring to make it a priority .
To help it along , Duncan and Sebelius planned to join the report 's researchers on Monday at a news conference to introduce the report , along with administration allies . They planned events later in the week to reiterate their support .
Yet those public events were unlikely to sway lawmakers who are already fighting among themselves over spending cuts that are forcing students to be dropped from existing preschool programs , the levying of higher fees for student loans and deep cuts for aid to military schools .
States spent about $ 5.1 billion on pre-K programs in 2011-12 , the most recent school year , researchers wrote in the report .
Per-student funding for existing programs during that year dropped to an average of $ 3,841 for each student . It was the first time average spending per student dropped below $ 4,000 in today 's dollars since researchers started tracking it during the 2001-02 academic year .
Adjusted for inflation , per-student funding has been cut by more than $ 1,000 during the last decade .
Yet nationwide , the amounts were widely varied . The District of Columbia spent almost $ 14,000 on every child in its program while the states of Colorado , South Carolina and Nebraska spent less than $ 2,000 per child .
`` Whether you get a quality preschool program does depend on what ZIP code you are in , '' Barnett said .
Among the 40 states that offer state-funded pre-K programs , 27 cut per-student spending last year . In total , that meant $ 548 million in cuts .
Money , of course , is not a guarantee for students ' success . But students from poor schools generally lag students from better-funded counterparts and those students from impoverished families arrive in kindergarten less prepared than others .

That , too , suggests problems for Obama 's plan to expand pre-K programs , especially if Washington insists its partners meet quality benchmarks to win federal dollars .","State funding for pre-kindergarten programs had its largest drop ever last year and states are now spending less per child than they did a decade ago, according to a report released Monday.

The report also found that more than a half million of those preschool students are in programs that don't even meet standards suggested by industry experts that would qualify for federal dollars.

Those findings — combined with Congress' reluctance to spend new dollars — complicate President Barack Obama's effort to expand pre-K programs across the country. While Education Secretary Arne Duncan and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius continue to promote the president's proposal, researchers say existing programs are inadequate, and until their shortcomings are fixed there is little desire by lawmakers to get behind Obama's call for more preschool.

""The state of preschool was a state of emergency,"" said Steven Barnett, director of the National Institute for Early Education Research at Rutgers University, which produced the report.

During his State of the Union speech, Obama proposed a federal-state partnership that would dramatically expand options for families with young children. Obama's plan would fund public preschool for any 4-year-old whose family income was below twice the federal poverty rate.

If it were in place this year, the plan would allow a family of four with two children to enroll students in a pre-K program if the family earned less than $46,566.

Students from families who earn more could participate in the program, but their parents would have to pay tuition based on their income. Eventually, 3-year-old students would be part of the program, too.

As part of his budget request, Obama proposed spending $75 billion over 10 years to help states get these new programs up and running. During the first years, Washington would pick up the majority of the cost before shifting costs to states.

""It's the most significant opportunity to expand access to pre-K that this nation has ever seen,"" Barnett said of the president's proposal.

Obama proposed paying for this expansion by almost doubling the federal tax on cigarettes, to $1.95 per pack.

Obama's pre-K plan faces a tough uphill climb, though, with the tobacco industry opposing the tax that would pay for it and lawmakers from tobacco-producing states also skeptical. Conservative lawmakers have balked at starting another government program, as well. Obama's Democratic allies are clamoring to make it a priority.

To help it along, Duncan and Sebelius planned to join the report's researchers on Monday at a news conference to introduce the report, along with administration allies. They planned events later in the week to reiterate their support.

Yet those public events were unlikely to sway lawmakers who are already fighting among themselves over spending cuts that are forcing students to be dropped from existing preschool programs, the levying of higher fees for student loans and deep cuts for aid to military schools.

States spent about $5.1 billion on pre-K programs in 2011-12, the most recent school year, researchers wrote in the report.

Per-student funding for existing programs during that year dropped to an average of $3,841 for each student. It was the first time average spending per student dropped below $4,000 in today's dollars since researchers started tracking it during the 2001-02 academic year.

Adjusted for inflation, per-student funding has been cut by more than $1,000 during the last decade.

Yet nationwide, the amounts were widely varied. The District of Columbia spent almost $14,000 on every child in its program while the states of Colorado, South Carolina and Nebraska spent less than $2,000 per child.

""Whether you get a quality preschool program does depend on what ZIP code you are in,"" Barnett said.

Among the 40 states that offer state-funded pre-K programs, 27 cut per-student spending last year. In total, that meant $548 million in cuts.

Money, of course, is not a guarantee for students' success. But students from poor schools generally lag students from better-funded counterparts and those students from impoverished families arrive in kindergarten less prepared than others.

In all, only 15 states and the District of Columbia spent enough money to provide quality programs, the researchers concluded. Those programs serve about 20 percent of the 1.3 million enrolled in state-funded prekindergarten programs.

""In far too many states, funding levels have fallen so low as to bring into question the effectiveness of their programs by any reasonable standard,"" researchers wrote.

Part of the reason for the decreased spending are the lingering effects of the economic downturn in 2008, coupled with the end of federal stimulus dollars to plug state budgets.

education,The American Conservative,2,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-student-loan-trap/,The Student Loan Trap,,,"Rodney Spangler first enrolled at the University of North Texas in 2001 . There , he pursued a degree in what the school now calls “ integrative studies , ” focusing on history , philosophy , and criminal justice . Rodney also worked full time , and so attended UNT on and off until 2007 .
For every semester of classes , Spangler took out student loans . When he left—without a degree—he estimates that he had about $ 30,000 in outstanding student debt .
“ At first I always intended to repay them , but the first time I took a semester off , I started getting due notices/bills for them , ” Spangler told ███ by email . “ [ I s ] tarted going back , but the ones that came due kept sending notices , like there was no ‘ pause ’ button . ”
Overwhelmed by bills , Spangler simply stopped paying . Today , thanks to interest and delinquency penalties , he estimates his outstanding debt is about $ 60,000—double what it was . “ I just don ’ t see how I can ever pay those off , ” Spangler wrote , “ short of winning the lottery . ”
Of course , it ’ s possible to go on living with a five-figure debt hanging over your head , but it imposes more than its fair share of limitations . When Spangler tried to get a job in law enforcement , he met all the requirements , but was denied because of his credit history .
“ I had some of the highest placement scores they had seen , ” Spangler claims , “ but my credit report had too many negative marks. ” With one or two exceptions , all of those marks were from student loans .
The weight of the debt has not only hindered Spangler ’ s search for employment—it has also affected his family and romantic life . He has had to rely on his parents to cosign for loans . And , he says , he has been “ a little reticent to pursue a serious relationship , ” thanks in part to fear of being judged for his debt .
Spangler is not alone : he ’ s one of the 44 million Americans who holds student debt , 30 percent of the population who have attended college . Together , they owe about $ 1.5 trillion , a bigger burden than credit cards , auto loans , or any other non-mortgage debt .
That there is a student debt crisis is not news . Media sites report on it frequently ; academics attend to it with increasing trepidation . But in focusing on the scale of the problem , we sometimes forget to think about how all that debt affects people ’ s lives .
Specifically , the last 20 years of student debt accumulation—driven largely by federal policy—have radically shifted the life-courses of younger Americans , whether late Gen Xers like Spangler or Millennials . Millions of Americans now enter adulthood with a burden unfaced by their parents or grandparents , which in turn slows their family formation , alters labor market behavior , and represents a profound alteration to how they live out citizenship .
Americans , historically , had little schooling . In 1900 , less than 10 percent went to or graduated from high school ; by 1910 , the median adult had completed only 8 years of schooling . Americans , since Tocqueville ’ s time at least , have believed that education was the nursemaid of citizenship . But only recently has that come to mean more than primary schooling .
The modern , post-war economy , however , precipitated a radical change in America ’ s educational composition . In 1962 , just 19 percent had been to college ; today , 61 percent have . The proportion actually graduating went from 9 to 35 percent in the same period . In short , over the past half century , higher education has gone from the exception to the norm .
Stretching back at least to the G.I . Bill , government has carried the lion ’ s share for this transition . In 1965 , the government began to offer its credibility as a guarantor of private student loans under the Federal Family Education Loan Program . In the early 1990s , the Department of Education started issuing student loans itself , under the Federal Direct Loan Program .
The amount of debt held by the DOE rose steadily through the 1990s and early 2000s , then exploded during the Great Recession . Preston Cooper , an education research analyst at the American Enterprise Institute , told TAC that many Americans , forced out of the full-time workforce , opted to reskill—and took on lots of debt to do so . The feds funded that choice : as of 2015 , 91 percent of all student loans were publicly held .
Publicly available data on federal student loans thus get us most of the way to a picture of the student debtor population . Those data show that as federal loans became readily available , millions of Americans took them on .
Clearly , some older Americans—especially ages 35 to 49—have debt , likely thanks to grad school and the Great Recession reskilling . But there is a pronounced disjuncture between even that group and America ’ s younger adults . Among those who have attended ( although not necessarily graduated from ) college , more than half are in debt .
We can look closer for an even starker picture . The mode 25- to 34-year-old debtor has between $ 20,000 and $ 40,000 of debt—the median annual salary for a recent college grad is about $ 50,000 . Americans currently in and fresh out of college owe similarly high amounts .
Maybe student debt is not so bad . As David Leonhardt argued in a recent New York Times op-ed , it is in large part held by college-educated kids from the top income quartile , who can expect a substantial wage premium . Student debtors are likely to be well-off , and a college degree will make them more so .
Two issues complicate this argument , however . The first is what we might call the “ Somes ” : those who , like Spangler , have more than a high school degree but less than a college degree , i.e . only “ some ” college experience . Federal survey data show that “ Somes ” account for the second-highest proportion of all adults and the highest proportion of 25 to 34 year-olds .
Whereas debt-holding college grads usually do well , Somes don ’ t . Essentially all of the college wage premium accrues upon graduation , thanks to what economists call the “ sheepskin effect ” —the earnings boost comes with the diploma .
The obverse of this is that Somes end up looking more like their peers with a high-school degree than a college one—except , that is , for a lot of student debt . As Leonhardt notes , 40 percent of Some borrowers defaulted on their loans , compared to just 8 percent who graduated . For a significant part of the student-loan-debtor population , then , there is no college-degree cushion .
There ’ s a bigger problem : even among grads , student debt slows the set of life choices we commonly associate with adulthood . Even if most debtors eventually get their lives on track , debt has substantial effects on how long it takes them to do so .
Unsurprisingly , having debt shapes young Americans ’ job market decisions . Researchers at the University of California , Berkeley found that grads with debt pick higher salary jobs , often over “ public-interest ” positions . They also found that bearing debt may affect students ’ “ academic decisions during college ” in a way likely tied to their ultimate career trajectory . Young Americans may be more cautious about entering low-paying , high-social-significance roles—including politics , an area where older Americans are conspicuously over-represented .
Then there ’ s homeownership . Americans in their 20s have always been unlikely to buy , but Millennials may be delaying well into their 30s . The couple profiled in a recent Politico article on Millennials ’ homebuying were 32 and 33 , respectively ; both cited their student debt as delaying their purchase . Analysis of British homeownership trends shows this is a common phenomenon , linking increased student debt levels to a “ delay ” in “ first-time homeownership transition . ”
All of this contributes to late family formation . Fewer young adults are married than ever and multiple analyses have found that student debt encourages cohabitation and reduces marriage among college-educated women ( although , interestingly , not among men ) . That translates into less sex , and correspondingly fewer kids . A New York Times/Morning Consult poll found that 64 percent of young adults had fewer kids because of the cost of childcare ( and , presumably , their ability to meet it ) ; among those who claimed not to want kids , 13 percent explicitly cited their student debt as the reason .
All of this is fairly intuitive—if you have five figures of debt , paying it down will inevitably require trade-offs , which means delaying life . But it means that college debt directly slows young adults on the path their parents enjoyed—homes , marriage , children , etc .
That ’ s the big problem . Even bracketing the Somes , spiraling student debt has had a lasting impact on how hard young Americans have to work just to make it to the same place as previous generations . The new normal of debt necessarily alters the shape of American life .
Crushing debt and delayed lives are of course unpleasant individual experiences , but there is a deeper problem of political equity . In America , there is a strong connection between education and the ideal of citizenship—a republic requires an educated populace . This connection implicates more than just reading and writing—Eleanor Roosevelt contended that every discipline , from Latin to mathematics , informs good citizenship .
In a society where education is a prerequisite for civic participation , raising the floor of expected educational attainment , we thought , would make better citizens . This was , for example , the instinct which induced President Barack Obama to call on “ every American to commit to at least one year or more of higher education or career training… . every American will need to get more than a high school diploma . ”
But what is meant as inclusionary ends up exclusionary . The explosion of student debt , with its concurrent effects on debtors ’ lives , means that many who go to college struggle along on the path to full , independent American life . Deviations from life course constrain young Americans in their ability to give back to their communities , to raise families , to buy homes , to teach responsible membership in society—in short , to be a citizen . The debt-financed education revolution risks retarding precisely the democratic goal it was meant to serve .
When we spoke , Rodney Spangler was 39 , almost 40 . He intends to go back to school next fall . He will still be heavily in debt , although perhaps finally getting a degree will help . Even so , he ’ ll have worked for decades for a position his parents could have reached with a high school education .
The proportion of the population that is college-exposed broke 50 percent in 2000 and has risen steadily since then . According to the Pew Research Center , the rising generation of “ post-Millennials ” are expected to be the most educated ever , with nearly 60 percent of those over 18 enrolled in college . If , as so many have argued , a new generation needs a renewed commitment to American citizenship , then they also need help surpassing the limitations stopping them from most fully living that commitment .

It came down to the wire, but finally, Republicans and Democrats agreed on a deal that keeps the interest rate on government-backed student loans from doubling. It will save the average borrower about $1,000 a year, but the compromise is likely to cost students a lot more than that over the long term.

The agreement that lawmakers passed Friday will keep interest rates at 3.4 percent for another year. Anthony DeLaRosa, a 23-year-old University of Colorado graduate, says it's a big victory.

""I think the reason that students should support this, first and foremost, is the fact that the 3.4-percent interest rate is being extended,"" he says, ""something that students pushed [for] very, very hard over the last several months.""

DeLaRosa works for the U.S. Student Association, a lobbying group. He says 7.4 million students who rely on subsidized Stafford loans can now breathe easier. But some say it's a small victory, given the other things Congress has done.

Not All Good News For Students

""In the last year, Congress has actually trimmed tens of billions of dollars in student aid,"" says Joel Packer, executive director of the Committee for Education Funding.

Packer says lawmakers — Republicans and Democrats alike — have actually made it more costly for students to borrow, and those costs dwarf whatever savings students can expect from lower interest rates.

For example, graduate students will now have to pay the interest on their loans while they're still in school. All students will have to start paying back the money they borrowed immediately after graduation — the six-month grace period during which the government paid the interest is gone.

""That's disappointing because Congress shouldn't pay for one education program by cutting another — in this case it's actually cutting the same one,"" Packer says.

That's not all, he says. Lawmakers have limited the number of semesters needy students can receive a Pell Grant and made it harder to qualify for the maximum award.

""So they've made a whole variety of changes. Overall, about $4.6 billion came out of students' pockets to pay off the federal deficit,"" Packer says.

The total cost to students, according to some estimates, is $18 billion to $20 billion extra over the next 10 years.

Chipping Away At Education Budget

This all began a year ago, during the pitched political debate over the federal budget, the deficit and what federal government programs to cut. The student loan program was clearly not exempt, says Getachew Kassa, legislative director for the U.S. Student Association.

""This was disheartening. When we started this campaign as a coalition of student advocates, we said that 'No way in hell are you going to take money from education,' "" he says.

But that's what lawmakers did, says Kassa. So even with interest rates remaining low, he says, the bigger story here is that students appear to have lost more than they gained.

""In the past year, we've had deals where students have basically been robbed. I think the real question to ask is at what point is this going to stop?"" he says. ""Because sooner or later — you take a little bit here, a little bit there — you have nothing else to take away from.""

Kassa expects both Republicans and Democrats to take credit for keeping interest rates from doubling. But he says students will be back in nine months, yet again fighting to keep interest rates at 3.4 percent for another year — and fighting to keep Congress from cutting student aid even more.",www.npr.org,center,QiegXgefdJoo0A8F

Tuccille, Eugene Volokh, Nancy Rommelmann, Zuri Davis, Damon Root, Eric Boehm, Baylen Linnekin, Tyler Lindholm","On Wednesday , Education Secretary Betsy DeVos formally announced the new rules related to Title IX—the federal statute that governs sexual misconduct in schools—thus completing a process that began more than a year ago , when the government first unveiled its proposed changes .
The new rules aim to protect victims of sexual misconduct while also establishing fairer procedures for the accused . The department believes the new rules will `` balance the scales of justice on campuses across America , '' a Department of Education spokesperson said during today 's press briefing .
Justin Dillon , an attorney with the firm KaiserDillon who specializes in campus misconduct adjudication , hailed the new rules as tremendously well thought out .
`` Nothing Betsy DeVos has done since she took office will have a more lasting effect on people 's lives than this , '' Dillon tells ███ . `` It 's frankly inspiring to see how hard she and her staff have worked to get these regulations done and get them right . ''
The new rules are similar to what the Department of Education proposed in November 2018 . Most notably , the government has abolished the single-investigator model , which previously permitted a sole university official to investigate an accusation of misconduct , decide which evidence to consider , and produce a report recommending an outcome . Under the new rules , the final decision maker must be a different person than the investigator , and a finding of responsibility can only be rendered after a hearing in which a representative for the accused is able to pose questions to the accuser—i.e. , cross-examination .
Importantly , the new rules narrow the scope of actionable sexual harassment to exclude conduct that ought to be protected under the First Amendment . Obama-era guidance had defined sexual harassment as `` any unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature . '' The new rules keep this definition but add that the conduct must be offensive to a reasonable person , severe , and pervasive . In practice , this should mean that schools will no longer initiate Title IX investigations that impugn free speech .
`` This new rule strikes a powerful blow against campus censorship , '' said a Department of Education spokesperson . `` Campus free speech must not be sacrificed in the misguided pursuit of any other value . ''
The new rules will also end the pernicious practice of universities initiating Title IX investigations in cases where the alleged victims are not interested in this course of action . Under previous guidance , any university official who became aware of a potential Title IX issue had to report it , thus triggering an investigation . Under the new guidance , school employees should make the Title IX office aware of potential issues , which will prompt these officials to reach out and offer support to victims . But a formal complaint that results in adjudication can only be initiated by the victim or their parents/legal guardians . This approach gives agency to victims and prevents schools from taking actions contrary to their wishes .
Nevertheless , victims ' rights advocates intend to fight the new rules in court . Catherine Lhamon , current chair of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and the former Obama administration official who presided over the changes that compromised due process , slammed the reforms as `` taking us back to the bad old days , that predate my birth , when it was permissible to rape and sexually harass students with impunity . '' That 's a gross misrepresentation of what DeVos has done , though not an unexpected one , given how irresponsibly activists and members of the media have characterized DeVos 's work .
It remains to be seen whether colleges and universities will carefully follow the new rules—much is uncertain about the future of higher education right now . Nevertheless , today is a big day for the restoration of basic due process and free speech rights in schools .

Chelsea Manning , who CIA Director Mike Pompeo referred to as a `` traitor , '' was slated to spend a day as a visiting fellow at the Institute of Politics at Harvard 's Kennedy School . Former acting CIA Director Michael J. Morell resigned his fellowship at the Kennedy School 's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs in protest . Pompeo followed by dropping out of a Harvard forum .
In response , Kennedy School Dean Douglas Elmendorf rescinded Manning 's fellowship in an open letter , insisting he had failed to strike the right balance between `` what members of the Kennedy School community could learn from that person 's visit against the extent to which that person 's conduct fulfills the values of public service to which we aspire .

Chelsea Manning, who CIA Director Mike Pompeo referred to as a ""traitor,"" was slated to spend a day as a visiting fellow at the Institute of Politics at Harvard's Kennedy School.

Pompeo followed by dropping out of a Harvard forum.

In response, Kennedy School Dean Douglas Elmendorf rescinded Manning's fellowship in an open letter, insisting he had failed to strike the right balance between ""what members of the Kennedy School community could learn from that person's visit against the extent to which that person's conduct fulfills the values of public service to which we aspire.""

'Economics will drive choices'

Burdens of meal distribution

Schools have become a key resource for families needing food assistance, which will likely continue no matter what schooling scenario takes shape.

The U.S. had already suffered what still remains the bloodiest day in American military history—the Battle of Antietam . And from the United States Capitol , the Secretary of the Senate read aloud President Abraham Lincoln ’ s Second Annual Message to Congress .
“ Fellow-citizens , we can not escape history… The fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the latest generation . ”
Abraham Lincoln , whose wisdom belongs to the ages , was sadly wrong on this point .
A study released on the 150th anniversary of the tragic night John Wilkes Booth slipped into Ford ’ s Theater and shot President Lincoln revealed another tragedy : Mr. Lincoln—and much of his legacy—is being lost to the ages . Today , half of the American public doesn ’ t know when the Civil War took place .
The light from “ the fiery trial ” of which Mr. Lincoln spoke seems to have flickered . Or has it been extinguished ?
One in five Americans failed to identify John Wilkes Booth as Mr. Lincoln ’ s assassin and one in three could not identify Mr. Lincoln as a leader of the Union Army , in a multiple choice survey . Just 18 % knew the effect of Mr. Lincoln ’ s Emancipation Proclamation . And when asked to identify Mr. Lincoln ’ s words , more respondents chose a passage from the Declaration of Independence than Mr. Lincoln ’ s famous phrase from the Gettysburg Address “ that government of the people , by the people , for the people shall not perish from the earth . ”
College graduates , too , struggled with the survey . More than a third of graduates didn ’ t know when the Civil War took place and only 28 % knew the effect of the Emancipation Proclamation .

It was 1862 in war-weary Washington.

The Emancipation Proclamation, an executive order to free all slaves in areas still in rebellion, was not yet in effect. The U.S. had already suffered what still remains the bloodiest day in American military history—the Battle of Antietam. And from the United States Capitol, the Secretary of the Senate read aloud President Abraham Lincoln’s Second Annual Message to Congress.

“Fellow-citizens, we cannot escape history… The fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the latest generation.”

Abraham Lincoln, whose wisdom belongs to the ages, was sadly wrong on this point.

A study released on the 150th anniversary of the tragic night John Wilkes Booth slipped into Ford’s Theater and shot President Lincoln revealed another tragedy: Mr. Lincoln—and much of his legacy—is being lost to the ages. Today, half of the American public doesn’t know when the Civil War took place.

The light from “the fiery trial” of which Mr. Lincoln spoke seems to have flickered. Or has it been extinguished?

One in five Americans failed to identify John Wilkes Booth as Mr. Lincoln’s assassin and one in three could not identify Mr. Lincoln as a leader of the Union Army, in a multiple choice survey. Just 18% knew the effect of Mr. Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation. And when asked to identify Mr. Lincoln’s words, more respondents chose a passage from the Declaration of Independence than Mr. Lincoln’s famous phrase from the Gettysburg Address “that government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth.”

College graduates, too, struggled with the survey. More than a third of graduates didn’t know when the Civil War took place and only 28% knew the effect of the Emancipation Proclamation. Less than 40% correctly identified the phrase from the Gettysburg Address—one of the most famous lines in American history—as Mr. Lincoln‘s.

Sadly, it should come as no surprise. Today, not even one in five colleges requires students to take a single foundational course in American history or government, according to the “What Will They Learn?” study. Despite Washington playing host to some of the most important events in American history, not one of the DC colleges in the study requires the course.

At Michigan’s Oakland University, American history can be swapped with “Foundations of Rock,” “Dance in American Culture,” or “Human Sexuality.”

At the University of California-Berkeley, the requirement can be replaced with “Dutch Culture and Society: Amsterdam and Berkeley in the Sixties.”

And at the University of Colorado, American history can be replaced with “America through Baseball,” “Horror Films in American Culture” or even “Wops and Dons to Movers and Shakers: The Italian-American Experience.”

Niche classes on sex, zombies, and musical artists—often financially supported by the American taxpayer—should never be substituted for the basics of our history and system of government. We’re trading Mr. Lincoln for Lady Gaga; World War I for One Direction.

Soon we’ll pay a higher price: employers are noticing. Fully 80 percent of employers believe all college students, regardless of major, should acquire broad knowledge in the liberal arts and sciences, according to the Association of American Colleges and Universities.

What is the solution? The American people and boards of trustees must demand that students graduate college with knowledge of our past. It’s not easy to change the curricula of hundreds of institutions, but once again we should look to the Great Emancipator.

“It is not ‘Can any of us imagine better?’ but ‘Can we all do better?’ … The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our country.”

Let’s hope Mr. Lincoln was right this time.

education,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/may/8/holder-schools-must-enroll-children-illegals/,No school choice: Holder mandates schools must enroll children of illegal immigrants,2014-05-08,Kelly Riddell,"Attorney General Eric Holder said Thursday that all schools must enroll illegal immigrants as students , citing “ troubling reports ” that some districts are discriminating against the children of undocumented parents .
“ Public school districts have an obligation to enroll students regardless of immigration status and without discrimination on the basis of race , color , or national origin , ” Mr. Holder said in a statement released Thursday by the Justice Department . He said the department will do “ everything it can ” to make sure schools meet this obligation .
Mr. Holder was joined by Education Secretary Arne Duncan in issuing the new guidance to school administrators , telling them to be more flexible in accepting some documents from illegal parents and not to require others that may prove a child ’ s age and residence . The guidance is an update to earlier guidelines the Justice Department issued to school systems in 2011 .
Although schools have a right to establish a child ’ s residency in a district , they don ’ t need to require the parents to have state-issued driver ’ s licenses or Social Security cards to prove they are in the country legally , the new guidelines state . Parents can produce a utility bill or a lease as a substitute .
The guidance is based on a 1982 Supreme Court decision that says children of illegal immigrants have a right to a public education . In Plyler v. Doe , the court struck down a Texas statute that denied funding for education to the children of illegal immigrants and a school district ’ s attempt to charge undocumented persons an annual $ 1,000 tuition fee for each illegal immigrant student .
Some states and school boards have challenged the ruling , most notably California in 1994 , when voters approved a referendum to deny all state-funded benefits — including education — to illegals . The courts later struck down the referendum .
In 1996 , Congress tried to pass immigration legislation that would have allowed states to deny public education benefits to certain illegal aliens or to charge them tuition . But it was withdrawn after President Bill Clinton threatened to veto it .
School boards then began to take action against illegal immigrants by requiring Social Security numbers or driver ’ s licenses . The also employed practices such as proposing separate schools for immigrant students and requiring paperwork designed to identify immigration status .
Today , schools in New York , New Jersey and Arizona , among others , routinely inquire into immigration status as part of the enrollment process , according to the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) .
In Alabama , public schools must determine the immigration status of children and parents during enrollment , and then can report the undocumented persons to immigration authorities .
The Education Department ’ s Office for Civil Rights has received 17 complaints related to enrollment policies since it first issued guidance in 2011 , Mr. Duncan said . Complaints were from Ohio , Colorado , Louisiana , New Mexico , North Carolina , and Washington , D.C. , among others .
That ’ s in addition to a number of undisclosed complaints filed in the Justice Department . In Georgia , the Justice Department evaluated the enrollment policies of more than 200 school districts and helped them resolve issues , authorities said .
“ We have continued to hear troubling reports of actions — being taken by school districts around the country — that have a chilling effect on student enrollment , raising barriers for undocumented children and children from immigrant families who seek to receive the public education to which they are entitled , ” Mr. Holder said .
“ Today ’ s updated guidance reaffirms the longstanding principle , established by the Supreme Court over 30 years ago , that all children living in our country have a right to equal access to public education , ” ACLU Legislative Counsel Joanne Lin said in an e-mail . “ School districts must adhere to this guidance , and meet their constitutional obligations to ensure that no child is locked outside the schoolhouse door . ”","Attorney General Eric Holder said Thursday that all schools must enroll illegal immigrants as students, citing “troubling reports” that some districts are discriminating against the children of undocumented parents.

education,Fox News,2,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/09/16/chicago-teachers-union-delegates-could-end-strike-at-meeting/?test=latestnews,Chicago mayor seeks to end strike after teachers decide to extend into second week,2012-09-16,,"Mayor Rahm Emanuel asked an Illinois court Monday to force Chicago school teachers back to work and end a weeklong strike he calls illegal , but the court wo n't issue a ruling until later this week .
The union has condemned the move as an act of vindictiveness by a `` bullying '' mayor .
Emanuel spokeswoman Sarah Hamilton said city attorneys asked the Cook County Circuit Court to force Chicago Teachers Union members off the picket line and back into classrooms .
A spokesman for the city 's law office , Roderick Drew , said the judge was n't expected to rule on the filing Monday , nor have arguments been scheduled . He did n't expect a ruling until later in the week .
`` Nothing will be set today , '' he said . `` Beyond that , we do n't know . ''
Cook County Judge Peter Flynn said to a city attorney that he preferred to schedule a hearing on the request for Wednesday , Drew told the Chicago Sun-Times .
Drew did not provide an explanation for the delay , but Flynn later said that Chicago Public Schools likely would want to confer with the union , since the union did not have an attorney in the courtroom .
The delay likely means that students will at least miss school on Tuesday .
The request argues the strike is illegal because state law bars the union from striking on anything but economic issues and that the work stoppage is focused instead on such issues as evaluations , layoffs and recall rights .
The 700-page filing also contends the strike presents a danger to public health and safety , partly because more than 80 percent of 350,000 public students rely on school meals for their basic nutrition ; it says 50,000 others , including autistic students , depend on special instruction . And out of school , children more prone to fall victim to violence , it says .
`` At a critical time in their lives , a vulnerable population has been cast adrift by the CTU 's decision to close down the schools , with consequent grave implications for the residents of the city of Chicago , '' the court document says .
The union blasted the city 's decision to resort to legal action .
In a statement released later Monday , the CTU said the filing appeared to be `` a vindictive act . ''
`` This attempt to thwart our democratic process is consistent with Mayor Emanuel 's bullying behavior toward public school educators , '' the union said in the statement .
The union and school leaders seemed headed toward a resolution at the end of last week , saying they were optimistic students in the nation 's third-largest school district would be back in class by Monday . But teachers uncomfortable with a tentative contract offer decided Sunday to remain on strike , saying they needed more time to review a complicated proposal .
Emanuel fired back , saying he told city attorneys to seek a court order forcing Chicago Teachers Union members back into the classroom .
Teachers on the picket line at Mark T. Skinner West Elementary School on Chicago 's near West Side declined to comment before the lawsuit was filed Monday as the possibility of legal action loomed over them .
The strike is the first for the city 's teachers in 25 years and has kept students out of class , leaving parents to make other plans .
Working mom Dequita Wade said that when the strike started , she sent her son 15 miles away to a cousin 's house so he would n't be left unsupervised in a neighborhood known for violent crime and gangs . She was hoping the union and district would work things out quickly .
`` You had a whole week . This is beginning to be ridiculous , '' Wade said . `` Are they going to keep prolonging things ? ''
Months of contract negotiations have come down to two main issues central to the debate over the future of education across the United States : teacher evaluations and job security .
Union delegates said they felt uncomfortable approving the contract because they had seen it only in bits . The union will meet again Tuesday , after the end of Rosh Hashana , the Jewish new year .
`` There 's no trust for our members of the board , '' Chicago Teachers Union president Karen Lewis told reporters Sunday night . `` They 're not happy with the agreement . They 'd like it to actually be a lot better . ''
Emanuel showed his frustration at the striking public school teachers in a written statement Sunday night .
`` This was a strike of choice and is now a delay of choice that is wrong for our children , '' Emanuel said .
The strike has shined a spotlight on Emanuel 's leadership more than ever , and some experts have suggested the new contract -- which features annual pay raises and other benefits -- is a win for union .
`` I 'm hard-pressed to imagine how they could have done much better , '' said Robert Bruno , a professor of labor and employment relations at the University of Illinois at Chicago . `` This is a very impressive outcome for the teachers . ''
With an average salary of $ 76,000 , Chicago teachers are among the highest-paid in the nation , and the contract outline calls for annual raises . But some teachers are upset it did not restore a 4 percent raise Emanuel rescinded last year .
Emanuel pushed for a contract that includes ratcheting up the percentage of evaluations based on student performance , to 35 percent within four years . The union contends that does not take into account outside factors that affect student performance such as poverty and violence .
The union pushed for a policy to give laid-off teachers first dibs on open jobs anywhere in the district , but the city said that would keep principals from hiring the teachers they think are most qualified .
The union has engaged in something of a publicity campaign , telling parents about problems that include a lack of important books and basic supplies .
`` I do n't think they 're wrong . The things they 're asking for are within reason , '' said Pamela Edwards , who has sent her 16-year-old daughter to one of about 140 schools the district has kept open during the strike to provide meals and supervision .
Others said they understand why teachers are taking their time .
`` As much as we want our kids back in school , teachers need to make sure they have dotted all their i 's and crossed their t 's , '' said Becky Malone , mother of a second grader and fourth grader , who 've been studying at home and going to museums over the last week . `` What 's the point of going on strike if you do n't get everything you need out of it ? For parents , it 'll be no more of a challenge than it 's been in the past week .

BAMN is active within both the National Education Association — the nation’s largest teacher’s union — as well as with local and regional teacher’s unions in Michigan and California.

Last year, 17 different BAMN members ran for elected positions on the Detroit Federation of Teachers, according to a newsletter sent out by the DFT. BAMN also ran five candidates for different national leadership positions with the NEA in 2017.

When the Berkeley school district suspended Felarca for her violent activism in 2016 (for which she was charged with inciting a riot), the local teacher’s union sued the school on Felarca’s behalf.

In January 2015, BAMN organizer Steve Conn was elected president of the Detroit Federation of Teachers. The DFT’s executive board charged Conn with misconduct later that year and removed him from office.

Conn and his wife, former teacher Heather Miller, were fired back in 2007 after leading a student protest that resulted in students being pepper sprayed. The couple sued and got their jobs back, in addition to a $300,000 settlement. Conn continues teaching today at Western High School.

BAMN was founded by the Revolutionary Workers League, an openly Marxist organization, in 1995.

As TheDC first reported in April, internal documents from the North American Man/Boy Love Association (NAMBLA) tie BAMN to NAMBLA., reveal the RWL — BAMN’s parent organization — worked with NAMBLA in the years just before the communist group founded BAMN.

One of BAMN’s founding members is on record identifying as a NAMBLA member, calling the pro-pedophilia group the victim of a “witch-hunt.” (Read TheDC’s full story on the ties between NAMBLA and BAMN here.)",www.dailycaller.com,right,J6gitO14UNya4XJ1

The ""white suburban moms"" comment came in a meeting with state education chiefs

He was talking about the Common Core State Standards, a controversial effort

Writes one commentator: ""This Obama educrat has stepped in it. Big time""

Proving once again that any controversy will be intensified -- if not illuminated -- by random references to race, class, and gender, Education Secretary Arne Duncan has ignited a storm of protest by noting opposition from ""white suburban moms"" to one of his prized educational initiatives.

In a meeting with state education chiefs Friday, Duncan said some opposition to the Common Core State Standards -- a controversial effort to standardize education -- has come from parents displeased that test results have exposed local weaknesses. Duncan said he found it ""fascinating"" that opponents include ""white suburban moms who -- all of a sudden -- (discovered that) their child isn't as bright as they thought they were, and their school isn't quite as good as they thought they were.""

Duncan apologized for the remark Monday afternoon.

Speaking to CNN, he said: ""My wording, my phrasing, was a little clumsy and I apologize for that.""

Duncan said his point was that the goal is to prepare U.S. students for a ""globally competitive work force"" and to challenge education leaders to better explain to parents why higher standards are needed and what it takes to achieve them.

""I didn't say them perfectly, and I apologize for that,"" he added. ""My point is that children from every demographic across this country need a well-rounded, world-class education and frankly we have challenges not just in our inner cities but in our suburban areas, too, and we need to have honest conversations about that.""

education,Bloomberg,1,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-12-03/asian-teenagers-top-world-in-tests-for-math-reading-and-science.html,U.S. Students Get Stuck in Middle of the Pack on OECD Test,2013-12-03,Oliver Staley,"U.S. teenagers showed little progress on an international test of math , science and reading , which was again led by students in Shanghai and Singapore , bolstering support for tougher standards in U.S. schools .
The U.S. placed below average in math and about average in reading and science among the 34 countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , the Paris-based agency that released results today of the 2012 Programme for International Student Assessment . There was little change from the last test three years ago , the OECD said .
Lackluster results for the U.S. on the PISA have fueled calls for the country to improve its education standards or risk falling further behind advancing Asian economies . Concerns about U.S. academic performance have helped give rise to the Common Core State Standards Initiative , designed to align and raise expectations for learning across the country . More than 40 states have adopted the standards , although some are delaying implementation because of concerns about a federal takeover of education .
“ The systems that are making the most progress have embraced rigorous curriculums for their kids , and we need to do the same thing , ” said Wendy Kopp , founder of Teach for America , the nonprofit group that places college graduates in teaching positions at low-performing schools . “ It ’ s very hard to make progress without adopting globally benchmarked standards for our kids . ”
Only 2 percent of U.S. students reached the highest level of math performance , compared with the OECD average of 3 percent and 31 percent of the students in Shanghai . The U.S. also had a larger percentage of students at the bottom of the scale compared with the OECD average .
About 510,000 students around the world took the exam , first administered in 2000 . To be eligible , students had to be between 15 and 16 and have completed six years of formal schooling . In the U.S. , 6,000 randomly selected 15-year-olds at 161 schools took the test .
In math , students from Shanghai scored 613 on a 1,000-point scale where the OECD average was 494 . Students from Singapore scored 573 , Hong Kong 561 , Taiwan 560 , South Korea 554 , Macau 538 and Japan 536 . Students in the U.S. scored 481 , also trailing countries such as France , the U.K. and Russia . Shanghai students also led the world in reading and science .
China isn ’ t a member of the OECD and doesn ’ t take part in the countrywide test , although Shanghai , Hong Kong and Macau do .
The U.S. was 17th in reading , 21st in science and 26th in math . Because the results are based on a sample of students , the national rankings can vary from about six to eight positions , the OECD said .
The U.S. performed about average in reading and science and below average in math , even though it spends more per student than every OECD country except for Austria , Luxembourg , Norway and Switzerland . The U.S. also ranks near the top of the OECD in the educational attainment of parents .
Shanghai ’ s schools have excelled because they have tough standards , invest in teacher development and are committed to improving the poorest schools , said Kopp , who now leads Teach for All , which works to improve education globally .
“ These are all thing we know how to do in the U.S. , ” Kopp said .
U.S. students are better at solving math problems with relatively simple structures , such as extracting a number from a diagram , the OECD said . They struggle with questions that require “ higher cognitive demands , ” such as taking a real-world situation and translating it into a formula , according to the report .
The U.S. could improve math results by implementing the Common Core standards , which require more sophisticated modeling of concepts than what is traditionally taught , according to the report ’ s authors .
“ If more students work on more and better modeling tasks than they do today , than one could reasonably expect PISA performance to improve , ” the report said .
The Common Core standards were developed by the National Governors Association and the Council of Chief State School Officers . The Obama administration has supported their adoption .
The standards are intended to shift the focus of all U.S. state education systems to career and college readiness , a move that some states and many other nations have already made , said Sonja Santelises , vice president for K-12 policy and practice at the Education Trust , a nonprofit organization based in Washington .
“ No set of standards , in and of itself , is single handedly going to change the U.S. score on PISA , ” Santelises said . “ What the Common Core does is give as an opportunity to shift the target as a nation . ”
Randi Weingarten , president of the American Federation of Teachers , said the results show that a decade of test-based schooling and teacher sanctions has failed to improve the quality of American education .
“ The crucial question we face now is whether we have the political will to move away from the failed policies and embrace what works in high-performing countries so that we can reclaim the promise of public education , ” Weingarten said in a statement .

U.S. teenagers showed little progress on an international test of math, science and reading, which was again led by students in Shanghai and Singapore, bolstering support for tougher standards in U.S. schools.

The U.S. placed below average in math and about average in reading and science among the 34 countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the Paris-based agency that released results today of the 2012 Programme for International Student Assessment. There was little change from the last test three years ago, the OECD said.

Lackluster results for the U.S. on the PISA have fueled calls for the country to improve its education standards or risk falling further behind advancing Asian economies. Concerns about U.S. academic performance have helped give rise to the Common Core State Standards Initiative, designed to align and raise expectations for learning across the country. More than 40 states have adopted the standards, although some are delaying implementation because of concerns about a federal takeover of education.

“The systems that are making the most progress have embraced rigorous curriculums for their kids, and we need to do the same thing,” said Wendy Kopp, founder of Teach for America, the nonprofit group that places college graduates in teaching positions at low-performing schools. “It’s very hard to make progress without adopting globally benchmarked standards for our kids.”

Math Performance

Only 2 percent of U.S. students reached the highest level of math performance, compared with the OECD average of 3 percent and 31 percent of the students in Shanghai. The U.S. also had a larger percentage of students at the bottom of the scale compared with the OECD average.

About 510,000 students around the world took the exam, first administered in 2000. To be eligible, students had to be between 15 and 16 and have completed six years of formal schooling. In the U.S., 6,000 randomly selected 15-year-olds at 161 schools took the test.

In math, students from Shanghai scored 613 on a 1,000-point scale where the OECD average was 494. Students from Singapore scored 573, Hong Kong 561, Taiwan 560, South Korea 554, Macau 538 and Japan 536. Students in the U.S. scored 481, also trailing countries such as France, the U.K. and Russia. Shanghai students also led the world in reading and science.

China isn’t a member of the OECD and doesn’t take part in the countrywide test, although Shanghai, Hong Kong and Macau do.

U.S. Results

The U.S. was 17th in reading, 21st in science and 26th in math. Because the results are based on a sample of students, the national rankings can vary from about six to eight positions, the OECD said.

The U.S. performed about average in reading and science and below average in math, even though it spends more per student than every OECD country except for Austria, Luxembourg, Norway and Switzerland. The U.S. also ranks near the top of the OECD in the educational attainment of parents.

Shanghai’s schools have excelled because they have tough standards, invest in teacher development and are committed to improving the poorest schools, said Kopp, who now leads Teach for All, which works to improve education globally.

“These are all thing we know how to do in the U.S.,” Kopp said.

Cognitive Demand

U.S. students are better at solving math problems with relatively simple structures, such as extracting a number from a diagram, the OECD said. They struggle with questions that require “higher cognitive demands,” such as taking a real-world situation and translating it into a formula, according to the report.

The U.S. could improve math results by implementing the Common Core standards, which require more sophisticated modeling of concepts than what is traditionally taught, according to the report’s authors.

“If more students work on more and better modeling tasks than they do today, than one could reasonably expect PISA performance to improve,” the report said.

The Common Core standards were developed by the National Governors Association and the Council of Chief State School Officers. The Obama administration has supported their adoption.

Common Core

The standards are intended to shift the focus of all U.S. state education systems to career and college readiness, a move that some states and many other nations have already made, said Sonja Santelises, vice president for K-12 policy and practice at the Education Trust, a nonprofit organization based in Washington.

“No set of standards, in and of itself, is single handedly going to change the U.S. score on PISA,” Santelises said. “What the Common Core does is give as an opportunity to shift the target as a nation.”

Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said the results show that a decade of test-based schooling and teacher sanctions has failed to improve the quality of American education.

“The crucial question we face now is whether we have the political will to move away from the failed policies and embrace what works in high-performing countries so that we can reclaim the promise of public education,” Weingarten said in a statement.

Students in the U.K. did slightly better than those in the U.S., finishing above average in science and reading and average in math. There was no change in results from 2009 or 2006 results.

Mayor Rahm Emanuel said teachers were harming Chicago 's children by striking .
`` This is , in my view , a strike of choice , and it 's the wrong choice for our children , '' he said . `` Stay at the table . Finish it for our children . ''
He said negotiators had resolved all but two issues -- teacher evaluations and provisions dealing with jobs for laid-off teachers .
However , Chicago Teachers Union President Karen Lewis said teachers had no choice but to strike , despite `` intense but productive '' bargaining sessions .
The primary disagreement appears to be teacher job security in the wake of a new program that evaluates teachers based on students ' standardized test scores . Chicago Teachers Union board member Jay Rehak called the idea `` data-driven madness . ''
As many as 6,000 teachers could lose their jobs under the evaluation system , according to Lewis , who called the system `` unacceptable . '' The mayor 's office , the city of Chicago , and school officials have questioned that job loss figure .
`` This is no way to measure the effectiveness of an educator , '' Lewis said Sunday . `` Further , there are too many factors beyond our control which impact how well some students perform on standardized tests such as poverty , exposure to violence , homelessness , hunger and other social issues beyond our control . ''
Another sticking point is a `` recall '' policy that would put laid-off teachers in line for job openings at other schools within the district . Emanuel said such a policy , supported by the union , would take hiring decisions away from school principals and put them in the hands of central administrators and union leaders .
`` Direction and dictation should not come out of downtown , '' the mayor said .
Teachers also want to block changes to their health benefits and win concessions on classroom conditions .
Pay is also an issue . However , the union said the two sides are close to a pay agreement after school officials offered to increase salaries 16 % over four years on average for most teachers . The average teacher salary in Chicago was $ 74,839 for the 2011-2012 school year , according to the district .
In addition to the pay raise , the school system 's offer includes paid maternity leave and short-term disability coverage . It would also freeze health care cost increases for two-thirds of the union 's membership .
The high school day would also be shortened slightly , and teachers would be limited to teaching five classes , the district said .
The district 's existing proposal would cost $ 400 million over four years , according to school board President David Vitale .
Chicago schools ca n't afford more concessions , Vitale said . `` We have no more flexibility when it comes to finance , '' he told CNN on Monday .
At a midday news conference , Emanuel called the plan on the table an `` honest compromise that respects our teachers , does right by our kids and is fair to our taxpayers . ''
Union officials have said they are puzzled by the stance of Emanuel , the city 's Democratic mayor , whom they accused of going back on promises to teachers , police officers and other civil servants , according to Rehak , the union board member .
`` He has definitely been a huge disappointment , '' Rehak said . `` He has disrespected virtually every middle-class person in this city . ''
`` Both sides need to get back to the table as quickly as possible and really stay in there , negotiate through the night if necessary , '' he said Monday . `` Get it over with quickly so that we can get these kids back in school . ''

Chris Christie offered a characteristically acerbic answer to reporters wondering if he ’ d reappoint Newark ’ s lightning rod superintendent , Cami Anderson : “ Yes we do , and we ’ re going to renew [ her contract ] because she ’ s done a great job , and I don ’ t care about the community criticism . We run the school district in Newark , not them . ”
Newark ’ s school district has been under state control for two decades , and has recently emerged as a top battleground in America ’ s education reform wars . A $ 100 million donation from Mark Zuckerberg helped secure the Newark Teachers ' Union ’ s assent to a contract that pays teachers based in part on their students ’ test scores – after which the union president was nearly ousted last year . Citing an alleged lack of transparency and consultation , the Newark Public Schools Advisory Board voted unanimously in April to re-name itself the Newark Board of Education and to declare no confidence in Superintendent Anderson . Demanding greater funding and local control , Newark students staged an Election Day school boycott and marched to Christie ’ s office and Anderson ’ s house .
Last month , four Newark principals were suspended after attending a forum , organized by Anderson critic and mayoral candidate Ras Baraka , about Anderson ’ s “ One Newark ” reform plan . “ One Newark ” would bring changes to over a third of the city ’ s schools , including bringing charter schools into district-owned facilities and designating “ renew ” schools where principals could replace existing staff . While the four principals have been reinstated , one has been reassigned ; those four and a fifth suspended principal are now mounting a federal lawsuit against Anderson and the school district , alleging violations of their First and 14th Amendment rights . ( A Christie spokesperson referred ███ ’ s inquiry to the superintendent ’ s office , which did not respond to a Friday inquiry . )
Interviewed late last week , Baraka -- a council member and school principal whose critique ’ s of Anderson ’ s ed reforms have fueled his mayoral bid – denounced the Christie appointee ’ s approach as “ dictatorial , ” “ totalitarian ” and “ narcissism. ” A condensed version of our conversation follows .
Recently you said , `` A lot of people like to paint me as a radical , but I do n't know if I 've ever done anything as radical as the thing that [ Cami Anderson ] 's trying to do. ” How so ?
To close schools and … start this universal enrollment thing at the same time , without letting parents know what ’ s going on -- not just on a traditional public school side , but also on a charter side -- not having a solid plan in place , and just , you know , going forward with it without any real thought … is incredibly radical .
Without even having a busing plan , to tell kids : Oh , now you ’ ve got to go to this school outside of your neighborhood school . How are you going to get there ? ... We ’ re talking about elementary-aged kids … Less than half of the , you know , population of the city own cars . I don ’ t know how they plan on enacting any of this – and not telling the parents about any of this .
I mean , it just seems … hasty at best . At worst it ’ s an extremely radical program that is going to , you know , dismantle the stability in public education in this city .
Do you think there ’ s been a good faith effort to engage with and involve parents in Newark ?
No , of course she hasn ’ t . I mean there ’ s a story … [ where ] the plan is to close that school , and parents were notified a day before about a public meeting that she was trying to have at the school to inform them . So that obviously gives the parents no time to begin to initiate or engage in any of that .
She also began putting out the one Newark plan , universal school enrollment , and all of that stuff , without any community meetings whatsoever . So what she did was put the plan together , and then begin to try to inform people about what ’ s going to happen . Not “ what do they think about what ’ s going to happen , ” but just going forward with it -- the closing of high schools …
Even the charter schools : She ’ s told parents that a couple of schools were going to be closed , Hawthorne Ave. being one of them … [ She said ] it ’ s going to be turned over to King ’ s [ Academy ] . And then [ KIPP Newark executive director ] Ryan Hill was in the paper the next day saying King ’ s Academy doesn ’ t function that way , we ’ re not going to take the whole school , we take schools one grade at a time ...
So [ instead ] she ’ s giving it to a “ renew ” school that has not been successful at trying to renew itself . So how is it going to renew another school if it can ’ t renew itself ? As a matter of fact … [ at ] Hawthorne Ave. , scores are higher than that school …
It begs the question : Is this really about school reform , or is it about somebody ’ s philosophical or ideological stance , that they ’ re just so , you know , didactic … that they ’ re going to push this program without any flexibility whatsoever , without any pragmatism , without any common sense ?
What do you think that “ philosophical or ideological program ” is for Cami Anderson ?
She wants this whole idea of , you know , a “ system of schools ” and not a “ school system. ” She wants to dismantle public education the way it is . She doesn ’ t think that , in and of itself , it works . She hasn ’ t really been doing anything for the traditional public schools except trying to “ renew ” them , and making them opportunities for charters to get in the building .
I don ’ t think that she believes in public education . I just don ’ t . Or traditional public education …
She ’ s trying to , you know , lower the budget , move kids out of public education , put them in other institutions , constantly expand … I don ’ t think any of it has any really to do with education .
Do you believe that principals were retaliated against for attending the forum you organized ?
Absolutely . Well , I don ’ t think they were retaliated against for attending it – I think they were retaliated against because they spoke out . I mean , there ’ s another , a central office secretary who was suspended without pay , because she made comments in a bathroom and was overheard … Then they offered her her job back , you know , later -- after all of the press and the lawyers and all this other stuff …
It ’ s like a scene out of some wild comic book . I don ’ t know what these people think should happen when you start punishing people for dissent .
Do you support the lawsuit by these principals over their suspensions ?
Sure . They have a right to their First Amendment and , you know , freedom of speech . If it ’ s trampled upon … if we allow that to take place , I mean it ’ s a slippery slope from there . I think it ’ s important for people to be able to stand up for their ability to speak out … without fear of losing their job .
Those suspensions – do you think they send a signal to other principals or to teachers ?
I think the attempt may have been there , but I don ’ t think so -- because at the next board meetings , when teachers were asked , or administrators were asked to stand up , they did , in solidarity . I think it may have backfired , that people under this kind of distress feel that they have to stand up or speak out , because they could be next .
The approach that Cami Anderson has taken – how much do you think it reflects Chris Christie ?
I think people take on , for the most part , the posture of their leadership . And when Chris Christie gets in public , and says that the people in Newark are not in control of their schools , I am -- when he says stuff like that , then it signals to her that … the person that she ’ s responsible to is the governor , and not the people of the city .
So Cami Anderson ’ s No . 1 problem is that she thinks that the Newark public school are apart , clearly apart from the city of Newark … and Newark public schools can go in one direction , and the city goes in the other . Which is absolutely absurd , because the city ’ s growth depends on Newark public schools ’ success , and vice versa . And because the governor makes comments like that , and we ’ re a state-operated district , it gives her the resolve to say : OK , I can do this without fear of any kind of dissent , or obstacle , in anything I want to do in this town and this city . So I think given that , she feels the freedom to do the things that she wants to do , without having to answer to anyone but someone who agrees with what she ’ s doing .
Well , I think Newark needs good schools , period … This idea of “ we have to build charters at the expense of public school ” is a ridiculous notion … That ’ s an argument that people are having about real estate , about space , about money and finances , when on the ground , the thing that improves education is what happens in the classroom – is teacher development , staff development , and extended days and , you know , curriculum …
If there ’ s something happening in charter schools that ’ s working , those effective practices need to be duplicated around the city . And vice versa : If there ’ s something happening in a public school -- traditional – that ’ s working , that needs to be duplicated ...
I think that if we give parents a real choice -- and we give them a real choice by beginning to improve public education in their community schools -- then they have the option . I mean , these people want to put education on the market , then really put it on the market . So help the public schools improve themselves , without taking away the resources …
Parents had options before … Parents had an option to go to a Catholic school , they had an option to go to a magnet school , they had an option to go to your neighborhood school , or a private school ... And there ’ s no problem with them having more options . But we can ’ t say we ’ re going to give them options , and take one of the options away . So where you tell parents , “ You have a choice , but you just don ’ t have a choice to go to your neighborhood school ” … that undermines this whole idea of choice …
If a parent is saying , “ I want to go to this neighborhood school , ” then they should be given the option to have the neighborhood school . And it ’ s our obligation as leaders in this community to make sure that the choice that the parent made is a good one . So we do what we can to make sure that the experience of that child -- or those children -- that elects to stay in a neighborhood school , is a viable choice for them .
Cami Anderson , at the Huffington Post … said , “ Our message of excellence has n't been as compelling as messages anchored in fear and intimidation to preserve an indefensible status quo. ” How do you respond to --
It ’ s like some kind of Cinderella story … What that is presupposing is that people weren ’ t fighting for reform before Cami Anderson showed up . It also presupposes that nobody wants excellence but her … It ’ s saying something negative about the people in this city , and what we think and we believe .
People in Newark have been fighting for excellent education decades before Cami Anderson even thought about coming across the George Washington Bridge .
The whole fight … in Abbott v. Burke , and the fight for equalized funding in education in New Jersey , was a fight that was anchored in Newark … The fight for wraparound services , the fight for attendance counseling … Fighting for all of the things that we need to address a whole child -- before Cami Anderson came . Before she came , there was a global village school zone . NYU was here , working in communities , with Dr. [ Pedro ] Noguera , with the “ Broader , Bolder ” approach that started in the central ward , with my school and a few feeder schools that fed into my school . So there were people working for excellence and reform before she came .
To tell people that you don ’ t want reform because you don ’ t want my reform is narcissism . And just to do something to people because they don ’ t agree with you , leaves narcissism and becomes dictatorial . Totalitarian … ” If you don ’ t agree with my answer , then you don ’ t want answers ” -- that ’ s basically what she ’ s saying . And it ’ s incorrect … Not only is it incorrect , it ’ s ahistorical . And it goes to show you she ’ s not grounded in what ’ s going on in the city of Newark , or what … has been going on in the city of Newark before she showed up here . And to characterize everybody who ’ s against her , or against her ideas , as fear-mongerers , or intimidating ? … Nobody ’ s suspending people from their jobs but her . All people are doing is responding to the things that she ’ s doing .
The Newark Star-Ledger editorial board referred to you as someone who “ has no credible reform plan of his own , but has scored points by fanning resentment against Anderson. ” What do you make of that criticism ?
I would ask the editorial board , have they even investigated Cami Anderson ’ s plan … And they have not investigated anybody else ’ s plan . So their statements are without merit …
I sat with [ editorial page editor ] Tom Moran and expressed to him my same sentiment : That just because folks don ’ t agree with your kind of reform , doesn ’ t mean we don ’ t want reform . And we had reform before she came … that was grounded in research , that was grounded in national best practices … He completely disregarded that . So did she …
He feels like -- or the editorial board feels like -- she ’ s being attacked without warrant . That ’ s completely untrue … They … run the Star Ledger and we don ’ t . But the community ’ s opinion matters as well .
The donation that Mark Zuckerberg made in Newark , which would appear to have directly caused this teachers ’ union contract under which teachers will be paid in part based on … students ’ test scores – is that good or bad for Newark schools ?
Well , you have to look at it this way . First , there ’ s no research , No . 1 , which proves or says that … giving them that kind of bonuses will improve instruction …
How would you spend the money : Would you spend it fighting for a contract to give teachers merit pay ? Or would you use it to help extend the school day ? Or would you use it to bring quality staff development to teachers , teacher quality , or help change the culture of buildings ? …
You win political points by pushing an agenda that ’ s a national agenda , and saying in New Jersey , in one of the most difficult , well-organized , union states -- teachers ' unions -- you got to push this teacher incentive pay . But at the end of the day , what did it do materially and substantially to change the quality of education that ’ s taking place in the classrooms every single day ? It ’ s not measurable , there ’ s no effect -- you can argue that it really had minimal effects . So then you have to say , was the money spent wisely ?
How do you assess Cory Booker ’ s record as mayor of Newark ?
To me , Cory Booker is the senator now . So people are still hanging onto Cory Booker …
So Cory came to Newark , he turned on the lights , opened up the stage , he filled the theater with people … he brought a lot of attention to Newark .
Now it 's time for us to do the work that we ’ re supposed to do . Right ? Now it ’ s time for us to collectively come together and improve what ’ s happening in our city every single day . We have real issues that we have to deal with , you know . And people are still … talking about Cory Booker , and we ’ re months away from a new mayor . So it ’ s time for us to move on .","Five days before the now-notorious lane closures in Fort Lee, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie offered a characteristically acerbic answer to reporters wondering if he’d reappoint Newark’s lightning rod superintendent, Cami Anderson: “Yes we do, and we’re going to renew [her contract] because she’s done a great job, and I don’t care about the community criticism. We run the school district in Newark, not them.”

Newark’s school district has been under state control for two decades, and has recently emerged as a top battleground in America’s education reform wars. A $100 million donation from Mark Zuckerberg helped secure the Newark Teachers' Union’s assent to a contract that pays teachers based in part on their students’ test scores – after which the union president was nearly ousted last year. Citing an alleged lack of transparency and consultation, the Newark Public Schools Advisory Board voted unanimously in April to re-name itself the Newark Board of Education and to declare no confidence in Superintendent Anderson. Demanding greater funding and local control, Newark students staged an Election Day school boycott and marched to Christie’s office and Anderson’s house.

Last month, four Newark principals were suspended after attending a forum, organized by Anderson critic and mayoral candidate Ras Baraka, about Anderson’s “One Newark” reform plan. “One Newark” would bring changes to over a third of the city’s schools, including bringing charter schools into district-owned facilities and designating “renew” schools where principals could replace existing staff. While the four principals have been reinstated, one has been reassigned; those four and a fifth suspended principal are now mounting a federal lawsuit against Anderson and the school district, alleging violations of their First and 14th Amendment rights. (A Christie spokesperson referred Salon’s inquiry to the superintendent’s office, which did not respond to a Friday inquiry.)

Interviewed late last week, Baraka -- a council member and school principal whose critique’s of Anderson’s ed reforms have fueled his mayoral bid – denounced the Christie appointee’s approach as “dictatorial,” “totalitarian” and “narcissism.” A condensed version of our conversation follows.

Recently you said, ""A lot of people like to paint me as a radical, but I don't know if I've ever done anything as radical as the thing that [Cami Anderson]'s trying to do.” How so?

To close schools and … start this universal enrollment thing at the same time, without letting parents know what’s going on -- not just on a traditional public school side, but also on a charter side -- not having a solid plan in place, and just, you know, going forward with it without any real thought … is incredibly radical.

Without even having a busing plan, to tell kids: Oh, now you’ve got to go to this school outside of your neighborhood school. How are you going to get there? ... We’re talking about elementary-aged kids … Less than half of the, you know, population of the city own cars. I don’t know how they plan on enacting any of this – and not telling the parents about any of this.

I mean, it just seems … hasty at best. At worst it’s an extremely radical program that is going to, you know, dismantle the stability in public education in this city.

Do you think there’s been a good faith effort to engage with and involve parents in Newark?

No, of course she hasn’t. I mean there’s a story … [where] the plan is to close that school, and parents were notified a day before about a public meeting that she was trying to have at the school to inform them. So that obviously gives the parents no time to begin to initiate or engage in any of that.

She also began putting out the one Newark plan, universal school enrollment, and all of that stuff, without any community meetings whatsoever. So what she did was put the plan together, and then begin to try to inform people about what’s going to happen. Not “what do they think about what’s going to happen,” but just going forward with it -- the closing of high schools …

Even the charter schools: She’s told parents that a couple of schools were going to be closed, Hawthorne Ave. being one of them … [She said] it’s going to be turned over to King’s [Academy]. And then [KIPP Newark executive director] Ryan Hill was in the paper the next day saying King’s Academy doesn’t function that way, we’re not going to take the whole school, we take schools one grade at a time ...

So [instead] she’s giving it to a “renew” school that has not been successful at trying to renew itself. So how is it going to renew another school if it can’t renew itself? As a matter of fact … [at] Hawthorne Ave., scores are higher than that school …

It begs the question: Is this really about school reform, or is it about somebody’s philosophical or ideological stance, that they’re just so, you know, didactic … that they’re going to push this program without any flexibility whatsoever, without any pragmatism, without any common sense?

What do you think that “philosophical or ideological program” is for Cami Anderson?

She wants this whole idea of, you know, a “system of schools” and not a “school system.” She wants to dismantle public education the way it is. She doesn’t think that, in and of itself, it works.

Do you believe Newark needs more charter schools?

Well, I think Newark needs good schools, period … This idea of “we have to build charters at the expense of public school” is a ridiculous notion … That’s an argument that people are having about real estate, about space, about money and finances, when on the ground, the thing that improves education is what happens in the classroom – is teacher development, staff development, and extended days and, you know, curriculum …

John Matthews : Parents need to be proactive about their children 's school security plans
He says an important question is : Does the school regularly practice safety drills ?
Matthews : Real-time practice scenarios are essential to a strong school safety plan
Barely more than a week into the new school year and a gunman armed with an assault rifle has attacked an elementary school in Decatur , Georgia . Fortunately , the gunman was apprehended before anyone was injured or killed .
Although the outcome of this most recent attack was significantly better than the carnage witnessed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown , Connecticut , last December , parents need to be proactive when it comes to their children 's school security plans . Before sending their precious little ones back to school , every parent should ask their school administrators the following questions :
1 . Does the school have a crisis response plan customized for its campus ?
Over the last decade , many states have mandated that schools have crisis response plans . This sounds like a good idea in theory .

John Matthews: Parents need to be proactive about their children's school security plans

He says an important question is: Does the school regularly practice safety drills?

Matthews: Real-time practice scenarios are essential to a strong school safety plan

This commentary was originally published in August, 2013.

Barely more than a week into the new school year and a gunman armed with an assault rifle has attacked an elementary school in Decatur, Georgia. Fortunately, the gunman was apprehended before anyone was injured or killed.

Although the outcome of this most recent attack was significantly better than the carnage witnessed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, last December, parents need to be proactive when it comes to their children's school security plans. Before sending their precious little ones back to school, every parent should ask their school administrators the following questions:

1. Does the school have a crisis response plan customized for its campus?

Over the last decade, many states have mandated that schools have crisis response plans. This sounds like a good idea in theory. But because they were mandated, many schools have simply copied generic plans provided by the state or another school district in order to meet their legal requirements. Make sure that your school has a crisis response plan that has been specifically designed for its unique characteristics, demographics and personnel.

2. Does your campus regularly practice school safety drills?

If your campus does not regularly practice basic school safety drills such as lockdowns, shelter-in-place and evacuations, ask the administrators why not? There is no good reason they can give you for not being prepared. The old adage ""practice makes perfect"" not only applies to reading, writing and arithmetic. Most school safety experts advise campuses to practice such drills at least once per semester with teachers and school staff also drilling during in-service training days.

3. What should parents do if there is an emergency at the school?

Your school should be providing you with information regarding your role as a parent during a school crisis. Whom do you call? Where do you go? What do you when you get there? What documents do you need to bring, if any? Many school districts require all parents to show proper identification to pick up their child after a ""nontraditional release"" such as an evacuation. Make sure you know the school and districts policies for such an incident.

The main reason for that is that most schools are controlled by government. Government is a monopoly, and monopolies resist change. Actually, most of us resist change. We don't want to give up the way we've always done things. Certainly, few of us want to work harder, or differently. We get set in our ways.

But when there is competition, we can't get away with that. If we don't adopt better ways of doing things, we go out of business. That forces innovation.

In that film, actor Edward James Olmos played math teacher Jaime Escalante. Escalante taught at California's Garfield High School. The student body was, and is, composed of some of the most ""disadvantaged"" students in America. Yet more Garfield High students passed advanced placement calculus tests than did students from Beverly Hills High.

Escalante was the reason. He was simply a better teacher.

Coulson interviewed some of his former students, who said, ""Escalante worked as if his life depended on the success of his students.""

The results were beyond belief … literally. His students did so well on the state calculus test that authorities accused them of cheating. They made them take the test again. The students aced the test the second time.

Coulson says, ""In any other field, we might expect this combination of success, scalability, and publicity to have catapulted Escalante to the top of his profession and spread his teaching model across the country."" That isn't what happened.

Garfield's union teachers resented Escalante's fame and work ethic.

A former Garfield student who now is a teacher told Coulson, ""The problem was that Escalante's classes were big… He was setting a precedent, giving the message to the administrator: 'If Escalante can do it, why not you?'""

The union used its organizing power to get votes to oust Escalante as math department chairman. Escalante then quit.

And that 's a vexing problem according to Liu . `` I think the greatest enemy here is indifference , '' he told Mo Rocca . `` Indifference can take various forms . One is , 'The game is rigged , so why should I even bother paying attention ? My vote does n't matter . ' The other form is , 'Huh ? What ? ' Not even apathy , but complete ignorance . ' ''

`` Civics ? Did n't I take that in high school ? '' If you 're over the age of 60 , you probably did ! Civics is the study of how to be a good citizen . In fact , that was the original mission of public schools : creating good citizens . Part of that was learning how the government works .
Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor and fellow Justice Neil Gorsuch agreed to talk to Rocca about their work promoting civic education .
Sotomayor said , `` It 's been well documented that the partisan discord in our country followed very closely on the heels of schools stopping to teach civic education . One must remember why . It was n't for an unimportant reason ; there was a change of emphasis in the educational system in the country where they wanted to pay more attention to STEM . ''
`` Only about 25 % of Americans can name the three branches of government , '' said Gorsuch . `` A third of them ca n't name any branch of government . And 10 % believe that Judge Judy is one of our colleagues . With no disrespect to Judge Judy , she is not a member of the Supreme Court ! ''
Supreme Court Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Neil Gorsuch are promoting better education in citizenship . ███
They 're following in the footsteps of former Justice Sandra Day O'Connor , who led the drive to return civics to the classroom .
During a 2012 Senate hearing , O'Connor said , `` I well remember having a lot of civics classes , and I got pretty sick and tired of it , to tell you the truth . I thought it was miserable . '' So , she started iCivics , a more engaging curriculum which helps teach civics through video games .
The most popular games include `` Win the White House , '' in which players campaign for the Oval Office ; and `` Do I Have a Right ? , '' in which lawyers fight to protect their clients ' rights under the Constitution .
`` That 's a tough game ! '' said Gorsuch . `` Very , very tough ! '' she agreed .
Gorsuch said , `` It 's important if we the people are going to run our government , that we know what it is , how it works , and how we can participate in it . ''
A second important component of civics is civility . Civility is manners – that thing in short supply these days , like you and I learning to disagree without tearing each other 's heads off . But that does n't mean everyone agreeing on everything .
West Chicago Community High School 's Mary Ellen Daneels said , `` I tell my students , ' I do n't want you to come in here and hold hands and sing 'Kumbaya . ' I want us to have better arguments . I want us to understand these complex issues that face our republic . ''
Daneels wants her students to debate controversial topics , like the appropriateness of using Native Americans as sports mascots . And she does n't shy away from what 's happening right now , whether it 's presidential tweets , or fights on the floor of the House .

`` To be honest , I do n't use a textbook in my classroom , '' said Daneels . `` Our textbook is the newspaper . ''
West Chicago seniors Daniela Alamarles , Spencer Usedom , Sabrina Lutfiyeva and Rudy Munoz are currently in the course . `` It 's not about the conflict , as much as it 's about how you speak , '' said Alamarles .
Rocca asked , `` How big a role is President Trump playing in your class ? ''
`` The president 's infamous Twitter account , that 's just like an everyday Tuesday for most of us , '' laughed Munoz .
Usedom said , `` We deal with a lot of drama everyday because it 's high school . A lot of stuff goes down in the hallways . ''
`` We 're teenagers and we can be civil with each other . But in the professional world I do n't see that , '' said Lutfiyeva .
Rocca asked , `` Do you look at the TV and yell at the politicians and say , 'You 're making my job harder ' ? ''
`` I do , '' said Daneels . `` But I also say , sometimes , 'thank you , ' because you 're an object lesson for my students of , 'If you do n't do this , this is what it looks like . Here 's a view at the end of the road ; is this what you want ? ''
And the last big part of civics is kind of the loftiest : putting country over self , and even over your party .
`` We have different views , we have different ideas , we have arguments . That 's good , that 's the nature of a healthy democracy , '' said Harvard Business School professor David Moss . `` But we also need to have something [ that ] holds us together . That that 's the part that I 'm worried about .
`` I think the reason our partisanship looks less constructive than it once was , maybe even destructive , is that we do n't have that glue holding us together . And that glue is a strong faith , a strong commitment , a strong belief in the democracy . ''
Consider that only 30 % of Americans born after 1980 say that it 's `` essential to live in a democracy . '' Moss , who teaches the history of democracy , is n't alarmed … yet .
`` American democracy has been more resilient than many people expected . But can it break ? And the answer , from the 1850s up to 1860 and '61 is , yes , it can , '' Moss said . `` And so , I think we have to just be careful with it . ''
Rocca asked , `` There 's no panacea here , right ? I mean , how are we gon na boost these numbers on belief in democracy ? ''
`` Well , I think bringing civics back into school [ is one ] , but not civics that students say is boring . We want to look for things that engage students , that are substantive , and you know , that they 're excited about . ''
Rocca asked , `` What do you say to the people – and there are a lot of them , I think – who say , you know , the reality of government does n't match up with textbook civics ? ''
Sotomayor replied , `` My answer is , what are you doing about it ? If you really care , then you ca n't complain . You have to do . Then we can have a conversation . ''
Or , as that civics education film said long ago , `` Washington , Jefferson and Lincoln are dead . They began our democracy , but they knew the job would have to be finished by those who lived after them … It 's our government . From here on , it 's up to us ! ''

I promise I did n't invent it just to cheer anybody up . But I hope it does cheer you up , because it 's real .
`` We are far more resilient than we give each other credit for , '' says Dr. Samantha Boardman , founder of positiveprescription.com and assistant attending psychiatrist at Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York City . And the research proves it .
Beginning in the 1990s some psychologists finally started turning their focus away from dysfunction to study its good-twin opposite : how people cope . By some estimates , at least half the population has gone through some kind of real trauma . ( And let 's assume , by September or so , that could be a lot more of us . ) And yet , writes John Tierney , co-author of the new book The Power of Bad : How the Negativity Effect Rules Us and How We Can Rule It , four out of five trauma victims did not suffer from PTSD .
`` In the long run , they typically emerged stronger , '' says Tierney . `` Instead of being permanently scarred they underwent post-traumatic growth . ''
The ███ most of us have n't heard of this positive turn of events , according to Tierney , is because good news never gets the kind of attention bad news gets . That 's a big theme in his book : Twitter , cable TV , and even the human brain love bad news and ignore most of the good .
This does n't mean trauma is some fabulous thing you should seek out , like probiotic Greek yogurt , because it 's so healthy . Trauma can be , well , traumatizing . But psychologists have seen people coming out the other end with an `` increased appreciation of life , deeper relationships with others , new perspectives and priorities , [ and ] greater personal strength , '' says Tierney .
Even in the meantime , while we 're still in the midst of this miserable thing , I 've been hearing from parents who are kind of stunned to see their kids not only coping , but almost unfolding like a tender green shoot , watered by the unexpected gift of the virus : free time .
`` My daughter is almost 12 and my son is 9 , and they 've been off school since March 12 , '' a mom in Canada tells me . `` I was expecting a lot of bickering and crabbiness and there 's been a little bit , but not nearly as much as I expected . '' Instead , her son spontaneously took a kite out to fly the other day—for the first time in his life . His sister , who normally goes to bed at 11 p.m. and has to get up at 7 a.m. , is still going to bed at 11 p.m. , but now getting up at 11 a.m. That probably means the girl needed more sleep than she was getting before , and that the extra rest is doing everybody some good .
Meagan Heryet , a fundraiser in Oregon City , Oregon , has an 8-year-old daughter who is normally , Megan says , `` a disaster . ''
`` She 's a hoarder , she 's an artist , there 's trash everywhere , there 's no laundry basket , '' says Megan . `` But since we 've been home—no prodding from me—she just decided it was important for her bedroom to stay clean . '' The girl is making the bed every day .
In suburban Virginia , Stephanie Gillespie 's son , age 14 and normally not too keen on school projects , `` all of a sudden decided that there 's all these things he wants to pursue , '' Gillespie tells me . Top of the list ? Building a computer .
Dark are these days but there is light at the end of the tunnel—and some pretty cool light shows inside the tunnel , too .","Here's something you might not have heard of: post-traumatic growth. I promise I didn't invent it just to cheer anybody up. But I hope it does cheer you up, because it's real.

""We are far more resilient than we give each other credit for,"" says Dr. Samantha Boardman, founder of positiveprescription.com and assistant attending psychiatrist at Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York City. And the research proves it.

Beginning in the 1990s some psychologists finally started turning their focus away from dysfunction to study its good-twin opposite: how people cope. By some estimates, at least half the population has gone through some kind of real trauma. (And let's assume, by September or so, that could be a lot more of us.) And yet, writes John Tierney, co-author of the new book The Power of Bad: How the Negativity Effect Rules Us and How We Can Rule It, four out of five trauma victims did not suffer from PTSD.

""In the long run, they typically emerged stronger,"" says Tierney. ""Instead of being permanently scarred they underwent post-traumatic growth.""

The reason most of us haven't heard of this positive turn of events, according to Tierney, is because good news never gets the kind of attention bad news gets. That's a big theme in his book: Twitter, cable TV, and even the human brain love bad news and ignore most of the good.

This doesn't mean trauma is some fabulous thing you should seek out, like probiotic Greek yogurt, because it's so healthy. Trauma can be, well, traumatizing. But psychologists have seen people coming out the other end with an ""increased appreciation of life, deeper relationships with others, new perspectives and priorities, [and] greater personal strength,"" says Tierney.

Even in the meantime, while we're still in the midst of this miserable thing, I've been hearing from parents who are kind of stunned to see their kids not only coping, but almost unfolding like a tender green shoot, watered by the unexpected gift of the virus: free time.

""My daughter is almost 12 and my son is 9, and they've been off school since March 12,"" a mom in Canada tells me. ""I was expecting a lot of bickering and crabbiness and there's been a little bit, but not nearly as much as I expected."" Instead, her son spontaneously took a kite out to fly the other day—for the first time in his life. His sister, who normally goes to bed at 11 p.m. and has to get up at 7 a.m., is still going to bed at 11 p.m., but now getting up at 11 a.m. That probably means the girl needed more sleep than she was getting before, and that the extra rest is doing everybody some good.

Meagan Heryet, a fundraiser in Oregon City, Oregon, has an 8-year-old daughter who is normally, Megan says, ""a disaster.""

""She's a hoarder, she's an artist, there's trash everywhere, there's no laundry basket,"" says Megan. ""But since we've been home—no prodding from me—she just decided it was important for her bedroom to stay clean."" The girl is making the bed every day.

In suburban Virginia, Stephanie Gillespie's son, age 14 and normally not too keen on school projects, ""all of a sudden decided that there's all these things he wants to pursue,"" Gillespie tells me. Top of the list? Building a computer.

Judge Allison Burroughs ruled Tuesday that while Harvard 's admissions process is `` not perfect , '' she would not `` dismantle a very fine admissions program that passes constitutional muster , solely because it could do better . ''
In her 130-page opinion , Burroughs stressed that race-conscious admissions hold `` an important place in society and help ensure that colleges and universities can offer a diverse atmosphere that fosters learning , improves scholarship , and encourages mutual respect and understanding . ''
The ruling in the closely watched case is likely to be appealed and culminate in a national showdown over affirmative action at the US Supreme Court .
The challengers had argued at trial that as Harvard 's `` personal '' rating system disfavors Asian Americans , it favors blacks and Hispanics , who generally have lower standardized test scores compared with Asian Americans .
The storied Cambridge , Massachusetts , campus accepts only about 5 % of its 40,000 applicants each year .
The Harvard ruling comes as college admissions practices are being scrutinized nationwide , including by federal prosecutors who allege that celebrity and other wealthy parents paid off coaches and education administrators to falsify student records to help them win acceptance at elite schools . The Harvard dispute centers on a wholly different but nonetheless longstanding point of contention : how institutions use students ' race to boost the chances of traditionally disadvantaged applicants and enhance diversity on campus .
William Lee , the Washington lawyer who represented Harvard , said in a statement that the decision `` represents a significant victory not merely for Harvard , but also for all schools and students , for diversity , and for the rule of law . As the court has recognized , now is not the time to turn back the clock on diversity and opportunity . ''
Harvard President Lawrence Bacow added , `` The consideration of race , alongside many other factors , helps us achieve our goal of creating a diverse student body that enriches the education of every student . ''
Edward Blum , a conservative lawyer who had engineered the challenge filed in 2014 , said his group , Students for Fair Admissions , would appeal to decision for the 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals .
`` We believe that the documents , emails , data analysis and depositions SFFA presented at trial compellingly revealed Harvard 's systematic discrimination against Asian American applicants , '' Blum said in a statement .
Blum has long opposed racial policies that have primarily benefitted blacks and Hispanics . In the past , Blum had sought white students to challenge affirmative action . In 2016 , such a case he engineered against affirmative action at the University of Texas at Austin lost narrowly at the Supreme Court .
The Harvard lawsuit was brought under Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act , which prohibits race discrimination at schools that receive federal funds . Filed on behalf of Asian Americans but without any named individuals alleging bias , the case has accelerated simmering complaints from students of Asian heritage that their numbers at Ivy League institutions are capped , just as Jewish students faced quotas on elite campuses in the last century .
At its broadest , Blum crafted the case to challenge a 1978 Supreme Court precedent that first upheld campus affirmative action , permitting universities to consider the race of an applicant among many factors , toward the goal of greater campus diversity , and forbidding racial quotas in admissions . Regents of the University of California v. Bakke was decided by a 5-4 vote and has been affirmed by narrow splits through the years . It now appears a possible target of reversal at a Supreme Court that has grown more conservative and in recent years and overturned a handful of liberal precedents from the 1970s .
Burroughs found that `` Harvard 's admission program passes constitutional muster in that it satisfies the dictates of strict scrutiny . ''
`` The students who are admitted to Harvard and choose to attend will live and learn surrounded by all sorts of people , with all sorts of experiences , beliefs and talents '' she wrote . `` They will have the opportunity to know and understand one another beyond race , as whole individuals with unique histories and experiences . It is this , at Harvard and elsewhere that will move us , one day , to the point where we see that race is a fact , but not the defining fact and not the fact that tells us what is important , but we are not there yet . ''
An appeal of Burroughs ' ruling would go first to the 1st Circuit , before any battle over race at the reconstituted Supreme Court , with two new appointees of President Donald Trump . Justice Anthony Kennedy cast the deciding vote in the University of Texas case . He was succeeded last year by Justice Brett Kavanaugh , whose record is more conservative than Kennedy 's .
The Trump administration submitted a `` statement of interest '' in the Harvard case , siding with the SFFA challengers and noting that the administration was investigating Harvard 's screening processes after complaints to the Department of Education from more than 60 Asian American groups . The Obama administration had fielded and rejected similar complaints .
Given the escalating competition in college admissions nationally , the trial drew an overflow crowd to Burroughs ' courtroom . The three-week hearing ended on November 2 , 2018 , and separate closing arguments were held on February 13 , 2019 .
During those hearings , the challengers argued that based on data they had obtained from Harvard , that admissions officials engaged in stereotypes that discriminated unlawfully against Asian American applicants , including stereotyping students of Asian descent as `` book-smart '' and `` not personable . ''
Students for Fair Admissions asserted four claims under Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act : that Harvard unlawfully holds Asian Americans to a higher standard than students of other races ; that it engages in racial balancing to keep roughly the same percentages of racial groups ; that it uses race not as a single `` plus factor '' but as a defining characteristic for admission ; and , finally , that Harvard bypassed race-neutral options that for campus diversity , such as tied to students ' socioeconomic backgrounds .
Harvard lawyers countered that any claims that Asian Americans fared poorly on `` personal '' scores arose from SFFA 's selective mining of data that failed to include the full pool of applicants , among them favored children of alumni , faculty and staff , and accomplished athletes .
The percentage of Asian American students accepted at Harvard has steadily increased in recent years . Harvard reports that of those students entering this fall as the class of 2023 , Asian Americans make up 25.6 % , African Americans 13.1 % Hispanics 11.8 % and Native Americans and Native Hawaiians 2.2 % . The remaining category , 47 % , covers mostly white students .
Each year Harvard accepts about 2,000 students , then ends up with a freshman class of about 1,600 students who choose to attend , from a pool of about 40,000 applicants annually . Harvard lawyers argued that if racial affirmative action were disallowed , the number of African American and Hispanic students in the total student body of 6,700 would fall by roughly 1,000 .
In her ruling , Burroughs rejected the arguments that Harvard could obtain sufficient diversity by looking at non-racial criteria , such as a family 's economic status .
`` Harvard has demonstrated , '' she concluded , `` that there are no workable and available race-neutral alternatives , singly or taken in combination , that would allow it to achieve an adequately diverse student body while still perpetuating its standards for academic and other measures of excellence . ''
No expert on either side of the case , Burroughs wrote , had proposed an alternative that would allow Harvard to `` meet its diversity goals while not unduly compromising on its other legitimate institutional objectives . ''
Regarding the Asian American `` personal '' ratings , Burroughs said she saw `` no evidence of discrimination '' beyond a `` slight numerical disparity . ''
`` The statistical disparity is relatively minor , '' she wrote , `` and can be at least partially explained by a variety of factors '' including information derived from teacher and guidance counselor recommendations .
`` Even if there is an unwarranted disparity in the personal ratings , the court is unable to identify any individual applicant whose admissions decision was affected and finds that the disparity in the personal ratings did not burden Asian American applicants significantly more than Harvard 's race-conscious policies burdened white applicants , '' the judge wrote . `` Further , there is no evidence of any discriminatory animus or conscious prejudice .
But Burroughs was not without some criticism for Harvard , suggesting some changes in its admissions office .
`` The process would likely benefit from conducting implicit bias trainings for admissions officers , maintaining clear guidelines on the use of race in the admissions process , which were developed during this litigation , and monitoring and making admissions officers aware of any significant race-related statistical disparities in the rating process , '' she wrote .","(CNN) A US district judge in Boston has upheld Harvard's admissions process following a challenge from a group representing Asian American applicants who believe the school discriminated against them.

Two colleges in Kentucky offer something that most university administrators can only dream of. Berea College and Alice Lloyd College charge students nothing for tuition.

While each developed unique business models that don't transfer easily to other schools, they do have some tips to help reduce the price of college tuition. More precisely — two tips and one caution.

Free college since 1892

Located in the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains in central Kentucky, Berea College was founded by an abolitionist in 1855. It was the first interracial and coeducational college in the South.

When students couldn't afford to pay for tuition, school officials eliminated it.

""Berea College has not been collecting tuition from students since 1892,"" says Jeff Amburgey, Berea's vice president of finance.

To cover costs without tuition revenue, Berea's board of trustees did something almost 100 years ago that impacts its financial situation today. In 1920, the board ruled that any unrestricted money given to the college would be invested in an endowment to grow over time.

The endowment is now worth around $1.2 billion, and profits from the investments cover a large portion of what it costs to educate more than 1,600 students.

Most students come from Appalachia. They all come from low-income families. And none pays for tuition.

""A lot of people say, 'This has gotta be fake.' But I came here. And it's legit,"" says 22-year-old Hollie Jameson, who is finishing a nursing degree. She's the first in her family to go to college. ""I will leave in May of 2020 with a free education as an RN. Absolutely no debt.""

That's not normal. At least, not compared with her hometown friends. Jameson says, ""I have friends in nursing schools here in Kentucky that say, 'Oh, my gosh, you're so lucky. Like, I already have $20,000 in debt and I'm where you are, and you have zero.' ""

It's all made possible by that endowment.

Takeaway No. 1: If a college doesn't have one already, it should fund an endowment designed to reduce the cost of tuition.

Still, even with good investment decisions and some luck, it could take 50 to 75 years before an endowment completely offsets tuition revenue.

For the impatient who can't wait for 75 years, the next example — Alice Lloyd College — shows what's possible without a massive endowment.

The school started when Alice Lloyd relocated in the early 1900s from New England to the town of Pippa Passes in eastern Kentucky. An Appalachian mountain man persuaded her to educate the local kids. He gave her a barren strip of land along a creek, where Lloyd founded a school that would grow into a college.

Locals had no money for tuition, and students weren't asked to pay. Instead, they provided labor, building the campus and staffing it.

Money was always tight. In perhaps its most famous fundraising windfall, Lloyd appeared on the show This Is Your Life in 1955. At the end, the host asked viewers to send a few dollars to the college. Bags of mail overwhelmed the local post office, delivering around $200,000 in donations.

But while Lloyd never asked students to pay, she did ask them to go home and serve their neglected communities. Lloyd kept framed pictures of students on the wall. ""If someone chose not to come back, she would turn the picture around backwards, so you couldn't see their face,"" says Jim Stepp, executive vice president at Alice Lloyd College.

And while college labor programs receive some federal funds, he says, ""It is a lot of work to do this. It costs money to [run] the labor program.""

Some colleges have tried to adopt the work-college approach only to give up because implementing the labor program was too expensive.

Also, research suggests that the work-college model is best suited for smaller institutions. In a chapter titled "" 'Work Colleges' as an Alternative to Student Loan Debt"" in The Neoliberal Agenda and the Student Debt Crisis in U.S. Higher Education, Nicholas Hartlep, chair of Berea's Education Studies department, and Diane Dean, an Illinois State University associate professor, write, ""creating mandatory jobs for all students may not be feasible in institutions that have larger enrollments. Even scaling up to 5,000 students could prove unfeasible, let alone employing enrollments of 12,000 to 16,000.""

Instead, the authors suggest that larger schools could try a hybrid of the work-college model. ""Although transforming entire existing colleges into this model may be unrealistic and improbable, interest is growing and it may be possible to create similar small programs on campuses to offer as an option alongside other forms of financial aid.""

Takeaway No. 3: The work-college model can help control costs. But it can also be expensive. Be wary.",www.npr.org,center,1WdWTYzQeDhfxrTb

DG : It really happened in the 1960s and 1970s after the unions gained collective bargaining rights . Everything the unions achieved before collective bargaining was through political lobbying , and in particular the way that the female-dominated teachers ' professions were able to ally with male organized labor .
After the unions have collective bargaining rights in the '60s , they were actually able to meet with mayors and school boards at the bargaining table and they were legally empowered to make demands and have negotiations with the people who supervise teachers ' work .

education,Politico,0,http://www.politico.com/story/2013/11/arne-duncan-education-secretary-100372.html?hp=t1,Arne Duncan schooled in limits of power,2013-11-27,Stephanie Simon,"There ’ s no clear evidence that Duncan ’ s prescriptions are helping . | John Shinkle/███ Duncan schooled in limits of power
Arne Duncan brought the most ambitious reform agenda in years to the Department of Education — and a determination to use every lever of power to accomplish it .
The results were stunning : In barely a year , more than 100 state laws were passed to open public schools to competition and set tough new standards for students and teachers . Duncan won allies on the right and the left , becoming one of the few Cabinet members with bipartisan support .
But the agenda he began to advance in 2009 has now hit serious roadblocks , highlighting the limits of federal power over education . States are balking at reforms they pledged to implement in exchange for grants and waivers from federal law . An unprecedented $ 5 billion intervention in the nation ’ s worst schools has yielded incremental results , at best . A noisy opposition to Duncan ’ s reforms has emerged — and it only grew noisier this month when Duncan dissed “ white suburban moms ” for opposing the new Common Core academic standards because the tough tests made their kids look bad .
To top it off , there ’ s no clear evidence that Duncan ’ s prescriptions are boosting student achievement , though his backers say it ’ s still too early to tell .
Duncan still has plenty of ambition ; he ’ s taking up several bold — and controversial — initiatives aimed at transforming higher education . Yet as his signature K-12 programs hit speed bumps , his legacy as a reformer is very much up in the air . Among the ways his reach has been limited :
— Duncan shrewdly dangled incentives to convince all but four states to adopt common academic standards meant to raise the bar for students . But he has no power to force states to adopt associated tests that the federal government has spent $ 350 million to develop . At least seven have dropped out and others are on the fence ; analysts fear that without the tests as a common yardstick , states will be free to quietly lower the bar that Duncan has tried hard to raise .
— He successfully prodded states to start holding educators accountable for increasing student test scores in hopes of raising the caliber of the teaching corps .

Arne Duncan brought the most ambitious reform agenda in years to the Department of Education — and a determination to use every lever of power to accomplish it.

The results were stunning: In barely a year, more than 100 state laws were passed to open public schools to competition and set tough new standards for students and teachers. Duncan won allies on the right and the left, becoming one of the few Cabinet members with bipartisan support.

Story Continued Below

But the agenda he began to advance in 2009 has now hit serious roadblocks, highlighting the limits of federal power over education. States are balking at reforms they pledged to implement in exchange for grants and waivers from federal law. An unprecedented $5 billion intervention in the nation’s worst schools has yielded incremental results, at best. A noisy opposition to Duncan’s reforms has emerged — and it only grew noisier this month when Duncan dissed “white suburban moms” for opposing the new Common Core academic standards because the tough tests made their kids look bad.

To top it off, there’s no clear evidence that Duncan’s prescriptions are boosting student achievement, though his backers say it’s still too early to tell.

Duncan still has plenty of ambition; he’s taking up several bold — and controversial — initiatives aimed at transforming higher education. Yet as his signature K-12 programs hit speed bumps, his legacy as a reformer is very much up in the air. Among the ways his reach has been limited:

— Duncan shrewdly dangled incentives to convince all but four states to adopt common academic standards meant to raise the bar for students. But he has no power to force states to adopt associated tests that the federal government has spent $350 million to develop. At least seven have dropped out and others are on the fence; analysts fear that without the tests as a common yardstick, states will be free to quietly lower the bar that Duncan has tried hard to raise.

— He successfully prodded states to start holding educators accountable for increasing student test scores in hopes of raising the caliber of the teaching corps. Yet Washington has no sway over how principals rate teachers on other factors — and in state after state, the new systems have yielded the same results as the old, with some 95 percent of teachers rated effective. Other states, meanwhile, haven’t even finished designing the new evaluation metrics or merit pay programs they promised Duncan.

The goal, spokesman Stephen Spector said, was to push states to take “aggressive” steps that will raise student outcomes in the long run. He said much has been accomplished despite the limitations on the department’s authority — limitations that he termed appropriate, given that education has traditionally been a state and local responsibility.

States are rebelling in part because of a frustration with perceived micromanagement from Washington.

Right now, America's schools are in a sprint. Forty-four states and the District of Columbia have adopted the Common Core State Standards. That means new learning benchmarks for the vast majority of the nation's young students — millions of kids from kindergarten through high school. And, for many of them, the Core Standards will feel tougher than what they're used to. Because they are tougher.

It's a seismic shift in education meant to better prepare kids for college, career and the global economy. But new standards as rigorous as the Core require lots of other changes — to textbooks, lesson plans, homework assignments. In short: curriculum and the materials needed to teach it. And that's the problem. Right now, much of that stuff just isn't ready.

Before we get further into the problem, let's be clear: The Common Core is a set of standards, not curriculum. There's a difference. Standards are goals we set for kids. For example, one Common Core math standard says fifth-graders should be able to use place value understanding to round decimals to any place.

Curriculum is what teachers do every day in the classroom to achieve that goal. Again, different. But, if you change standards, you've got to change curriculum too. And that's the challenge right now with the Common Core. Because most states have made big changes to their standards, forcing districts and schools to do the same to their curricula.

""There's been no time in American history where this number of school districts wanted to swap out all their reading and math materials at all grades for new things,"" says Jay Diskey, with the Association of American Publishers.

This race to update and upgrade all that stuff ends next year, when those millions of kids take their first Common Core test — a test that, for some, will come with consequences.

""We can no longer just pick something up and hand it to teachers and say, 'Go with it,' "" says Kate Gerson, a senior fellow with the USNY Regents Research Fund.

How did we get here? If states adopted the Core in 2010, why do some teachers still not have good teaching materials?

A Quick History Lesson

Back then, as states rushed to adopt, educational publishers — big and small, established and new — saw an opportunity.

""The marketplace was flooded,"" says Alissa Peltzman at Achieve, which helped develop the Core Standards. She says districts and schools were inundated with sample products — some new, some revised, much of it claiming to be in sync with the new standards.

""If you put yourself in the place of an educator, a district administrator, someone responsible for making decisions about material,"" Peltzman says, ""it's really hard to step back and know which materials really are high quality, and which materials are going to lead to increases in student achievement.""

""I think anybody you talk to will say it was a disgrace,"" says Amber Northern, vice president for research at the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a conservative think tank that supports the Common Core. ""Some of this stuff is kind of snake-oil salesman, you know? Developing good materials takes time, and I don't think they trusted when these materials came out that they were Common Core-aligned despite the sticker.""

Despite The Sticker

At the center of this story is a little gold sticker or stamp — or so it was described to me by administrators, educators and experts: Peltzman, Gerson, Northern, half a dozen teachers in Michigan, an associate state superintendent of schools in West Virginia — the list goes on. They all tell the same story. When publishers tried to cash in on the Core, many of their books had these stickers on them. Usually gold, with the words ""Common Core"" or ""CCSS"" in big letters. The message to schools and to teachers was clear: This will help you teach the Core. Here's the problem, says Amber Northern:

""That sticker appeared quickly, right after the adoption. There's no way they could have gone back and actually re-evaluated, re-assessed their materials, and truly made a good-faith effort to align those materials that quickly. It just was simply impossible.""

How bad were they?

The Storage Room

One answer lies in a storage room on the campus of Michigan State University, in the College of Education's Erickson Hall. It's a little dark, like a bear's cave — only, instead of bones everywhere, there are math books, on shelves, tables and rising from the floor like stalagmites. This is the domain of professor William Schmidt. He runs Michigan State's Center for the Study of Curriculum. And his team has analyzed some 700 math books — many with that gold seal — to see just how well they line up with the Common Core Standards.

Schmidt says he'll often review a book that's chock-full of material that has nothing to do with the Core: ""Maybe as much as half or more of the book. And so, in effect, if [teachers] follow the book from page one to page whatever, they're going to be led astray, and they're not going to cover the central material.""

Of the many books his team reviewed, Schmidt says, ""virtually none of them"" line up ""straight on to the Common Core.""

Professor Schmidt says his team has reviewed several brand new textbooks, and they're much better. But the landscape, in general, is still pretty bad.

Blaming The Core

As messy as this sounds, it's easy to blame the Core. But that's like a hitter in baseball blaming his bat when he strikes out. This isn't about the standards. It's about how they've been implemented. Some critics compare it to the botched rollout of Obamacare, hoping ""ObamaCORE"" hurts the president and Democrats in the coming midterm elections.

But there's one problem with that argument, and it's in the name itself: the Common Core State Standards. They aren't federal. Washington's not on the hook here. States are. Governors signed on — Democrats and Republicans alike — because they saw something necessary and ambitious. And implementing ambitious is never easy.

""We should not be surprised that this is hard, but that doesn't mean we should walk away from it,"" says Mary Cullinane, the chief content officer for Houghton Mifflin Harcourt — one of the top educational publishers.

She disagrees that publishers were just trying to cash in on the Core. The truth is more complicated. The problem, Cullinane insists, is that building good textbooks takes time.

""This isn't like building a song for 99 cents and then you put it out there, and if somebody doesn't like it they just don't listen to it anymore,"" she says. ""Teachers are being held accountable. Kids are being held accountable. Communities are being held accountable.""

This time next year, kids across the country will take a new generation of standardized test. And Cullinane is right: In some cases, students, teachers and schools will be judged on the results.

These tests — everyone promises — will be aligned to the Common Core. The same cannot be said for the tools teachers and kids have to prepare for them.

As I point out in my new book, A Government Of Wolves The Emerging American Police State , there are several methods for controlling a population.

You can intimidate the citizenry into obedience through force, by relaying on military strength and weaponry such as SWAT team raids, militarized police, and a vast array of lethal and nonlethal weapons.

You can manipulate them into marching in lockstep with your dictates through the use of propaganda and carefully timed fear tactics about threats to their safety, whether through the phantom menace of terrorist attacks or shooting sprees by solitary gunmen.

Or you can indoctrinate them into compliance from an early age through the schools, discouraging them from thinking for themselves while rewarding them for regurgitating whatever the government, through its so-called educational standards, dictates they should be taught.

Those who founded America believed that an educated citizenry knowledgeable about their rights was the surest means of preserving freedom. If so, then the inverse should also hold true: that the surest way for a government to maintain its power and keep the citizenry in line is by rendering them ignorant of their rights and unable to think for themselves.

When viewed in light of the government’s ongoing attempts to amass power at great cost to Americans—in terms of free speech rights, privacy, due process, etc.—the debate over Common Core State Standards, which would transform and nationalize school curriculum from kindergarten through 12th grade, becomes that much more critical.

Essentially, these standards, which were developed through a partnership between big government and corporations, in the absence of any real input from parents or educators with practical, hands-on classroom experience, and are being rolled out in 45 states and the District of Columbia, will create a generation of test-takers capable of little else, molded and shaped by the federal government and its corporate allies into what it considers to be ideal citizens.

No, Mr. Small, this is no longer America. This is, instead, fascism with a smile, sold to us by our so-called representatives, calculating corporations, and an educational system that is marching in lockstep with the government’s agenda.

In this way, we are being conditioned to be slaves without knowing it. That way, we are easier to control. “A really efficient totalitarian state would be one in which the all-powerful executive of political bosses and their army of managers control a population of slaves who do not have to be coerced, because they love their servitude,” writes Aldous Huxley.

The original purpose of a pre-university education in early America was not to prepare young people to be doctors or lawyers but, as Thomas Jefferson believed, to make citizens knowledgeable about “their rights, interests, and duties as men and citizens.”

Yet that’s where the problem arises for us today. Most citizens have little, if any, knowledge about their basic rights, largely due to an educational system that does a poor job of teaching the basic freedoms guaranteed in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.

That Americans are constitutionally illiterate is not a mere oversight on the part of government educators. And things will only get worse under Common Core, which as the Washington Post reports, is a not-so-subtle attempt “to circumvent federal restrictions on the adoption of a national curriculum.”

Putting aside the profit-driven motives of the corporations and the power-driven motives of the government, there is also an inherent arrogance in the implementation of these Common Core standards that speaks to the government’s view that parents essentially forfeit their rights when they send their children to a public school, and should have little to no say in what their kids are taught and how they are treated by school officials.

The result is a generation of young people browbeaten into believing that they have no true rights, while government authorities have total power and can violate constitutional rights whenever they see fit.

Yet as Richard Dreyfuss, Oscar-winning actor and civics education activist, warns: “Unless we teach the ideas that make America a miracle of government, it will go away in your kids’ lifetimes, and we will be a fable.""

States already rewriting the rules

NCAA administrators have been formally examining the issue of compensation for student athletes since May, with a task force led by Ohio State athletic director Gene Smith and Big East Commissioner Val Ackerman.

The NCAA's announcement comes one month after California allowed its athletes to monetize their likeness. The law takes effect in 2023 and allows college athletes at public and private schools sign shoe deals, ink sports drink endorsements and more. In New York, Senator Kevin Parker has a bill that mirrors California. If passed, Senate Bill S6722A would require New York colleges to share 15 percent of their annual athletics revenue with student-athletes. Meanwhile, House Democrats in Pennsylvania are hoping to push the Fair Pay to Play Act bill.

NCAA officials have been vocal critics of California's law, arguing that states shouldn't individually create student endorsements rules and should instead let the association create one rule that applies nationwide.

""As a national governing body, the NCAA is uniquely positioned to modify its rules to ensure fairness and a level playing field for student-athletes,"" the association's president Mark Emmert said in a statement Tuesday. ""The board's action today creates a path to enhance opportunities for student-athletes while ensuring they compete against students and not professionals.""

California bill will allow NCAA athletes to get paid

A number of former college athletes, who have since turned pro, have long advocated for a change in NCAA policy. Some of the NBA's top stars have publicly denounced the organization for generating billions in revenue and not sharing those dollars with student-athletes.

James earlier this year condemned the NCAA for not paying college hoopers. Other NBA players who have expressed similar sentiments include DeMarcus Cousins and Kyle Kuzma, also both with the Lakers, and the New Orleans Pelicans' Lonzo Ball.

When self-professed experts are wrong over and over , for decades , what ’ s the value of a university degree ?
Trumpism is sometimes derided as an updated know-nothingism that rejects expertise and the input of credentialed expertise . Supposedly , professionals who could now save us tragically have their talent untapped as they sit idle at the Council on Foreign Relations , the economics Department at Harvard , or in the offices of the Brookings Institution — even as Trump ’ s wheelers and dealers crash and burn , too proud , too smelly , or too ignorant to call in their betters to come in and save Trump from himself .
But do the degreed classes , at least outside math , the sciences , engineering , and medicine , merit such esteem anymore ?
Anthony Scaramucci ’ s Harvard Law degree seemed no guarantee of the Mooch ’ s circumspection , sobriety , or good judgement .
Bruce Ohr ’ s similar degree did not ensure either common sense or simple ethics . Or , on the contrary , perhaps at Harvard he learned that progressive ends justify any means necessary to obtain them . In any case , Ohr thought there was nothing wrong in keeping quiet about his spouse ’ s work on the discredited Steele dossier , or indeed in aiding and abetting the seeding of it , while he was the fourth-ranking official at Trump ’ s Department of Justice .
The Mueller team — along with a group of now disgraced , reassigned , and retired officers at the top echelons of the FBI , the descent of ex-CIA head John Brennan and ex-DIA chief James Clapper into caricature , the shenanigans of unmaskings and leaking at the Obama National Security Council , the warping of the FISA courts , the disingenuous operatives at Fusion GPS , and the implantation of informants into the Trump campaign — recalls the arrogant self-righteousness of the degreed geniuses who took us into Vietnam .
But this time around , the “ best and brightest ” ( remember the media ’ s hagiographic praise of Mueller ’ s “ all-stars ” and “ dream team ” ) would save us from Trump — much as John F. Kennedy ’ s and Lyndon Johnson ’ s whiz kids would deliver us from the North Vietnamese .
The liberal Washington Post recently fact-checked some of the claims of the new socialist candidate for Congress in New York , Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez . She has often boasted of her college erudition . ( “ How many other House Democrats have a degree in economics like I do ? ” ) Indeed , Ocasio-Cortez has repeatedly noted that she graduated fourth in her class at Boston University , with a joint degree in economics and international relations . Yet most of her major statements that she has made since coming onto the national scene have proven either wrong or unhinged .
In an interview on the rebirthed Firing Line , the international-relations major was forced to admit that she knew relatively little about the facts on the ground in the Israeli–Palestinian dispute , other than boilerplate left-wing anti-Israeli talking points . She claimed that the unemployment rate is low because “ everyone has two jobs ” In truth , only one in 20 do , about 5 percent of the American workforce .
Crazier was her statement that the “ upper middle class does not exist anymore. ” In fact , its numbers are at a near all-time high , nearly encompassing one-third of adults .
A series of Ocasio-Cortez ’ s assertions about Medicare and Obamacare turn out to be equally fallacious . She claimed that ICE had a “ bed quota ” that had to be filled by unsuspecting immigrants . That too is a false statement . ICE keeps a minimum of 34,000 beds for surges of detainees , but it is absurd to suggest that the agency must keep them filled .
No doubt Ocasio-Cortez , at 28 , is still young and inexperienced . But when she refers to her own supposedly stellar academic record , and then in a series of statements illustrates how poorly educated she is , one wonders , What exactly is the value of $ 300,000 Boston University degree ?
We could ask the same about Sarah Jeong ’ s UC Berkeley B.A . and Harvard Law degrees . Years of Jeong ’ s racist tweets surfaced , creating a firestorm , shortly after the New York Times hired her as a writer and member of the editorial board . Responding to critics , the Times noted that it had reviewed Jeong ’ s social-media history before hiring her .
Given her lack of prior publications ( other than The Internet of Garbage ) and accomplishments , it is hard to ascertain what on her résumé earned her the New York Times billet other than her clearly anti-white , anti-male , and anti-nuclear-family prejudices . And like Ocasio-Cortez , Jeong combined her smugness with puerile ignorance .
Jeong thought her banal and shop-worn comparisons of Trump to Hitler were somehow proof of her own genius : “ I was equating Trump to Hitler before it was cool. ” She lauded herself : “ How f * * * ing prescient was I on Trump = Hitler. ” ( She did not use asterisks . ) Actually , not very at all — given , most recently , the near daily dreary brown shirt/Hitler/Mussolini slurs leveled at George W. Bush during the Iraq War .
Narcissism , superciliousness , and tragic buffoonery combined to produce another Jeong declaration : “ White people have stopped breeding . You ’ ll all go extinct soon . This was my plan all along. ” As a self-described Hitler expert , she might have known that others had predated her on matters of a “ plan ” for racial extinction . ( In her doomsday predictions of a self-induced white holocaust , Jeong , a South Korean immigrant , seems unaware that the fertility rate for South Korean immigrants is among the lowest of all immigrant groups — and lower than that of native-born households . )
Jeong , the Harvard Law graduate and veteran of gender-studies advocacies , seems obsessed with comic-book-style theories of race : “ Are white people genetically predisposed to burn faster in the sun , thus logically being only fit to live underground like groveling goblins . ”
Jeong seems to be channeling either the crackpot melanin theories of former professor Leonard Jeffries ( Ph.D. , Columbia , 1971 ) who postulated an inferior “ ice people ” of cruel and brutal whites , set against a superior “ sun people ” of compassionate and calm blacks . Or perhaps she is echoing H. G. Wells ’ s dystopian notion of light-sensitive , white , flaxen-haired — and cannibalistic — Morlocks in The Time Machine , who dwell deep and goblin-like in the earth .
The subtexts of the statements of Ocasio-Cortez and Jeong are that our top schools are obsessed with race , class , and gender but apparently not rigorous in cross-examining the fables and pop fads of their students . Had either Ocasio-Cortez or Jeong been required to take an exit test to receive a B.A. , they might not have been stamped with any certification of education .
It is growing harder and harder to equate elite university branding with proof of knowledge . Barack Obama , another Harvard Law graduate , proved this depressing fact a number of times when he asserted that the Maldives were the Falklands , “ corpsmen ” was pronounced with a hard p , Austrians spoke a language called Austrian , there were 57 states , and Hawaii was in Asia .
Joe Biden , another law-school graduate , once stated that George W. Bush should have addressed the nation on television the way FDR did after the stock crash : “ When the stock market crashed , Franklin Roosevelt got on the television . . . ” Biden apparently forgot that FDR was not president in 1929 and that TVs weren ’ t introduced to the public until 1939 .
The point is not to cite egregious anecdotes but rather to reflect on why Americans have pretty much lost faith in their degreed elite . On most of the major issues of the last 40 years , what we were told by economists , foreign-policy experts , pundits , and the media has proven wrong — and doubly wrong given the emphases placed on such assertions by the supposedly better-educated professional classes .
On matters of non-proliferation , almost no one foresaw the sudden emergence of a nuclear Pakistan or North Korea . Post–Saddam Hussein ’ s Iraq turned out to be largely incapable of sustaining a Western-style democracy . Bombing Libya into an urban desert was insane given the alternative of Qaddafi ’ s recent efforts at recalibration . Free-market economics and tolerance for Chinese violations of trade and commercial protocols did not result in either the liberalization or the democratization of China . Over the past two decades , we have been told that the Japanese , the European Union , and the Chinese successively would eclipse America with their respective superior paradigms .
Because so often liberal ideology is deeply embedded within higher education , bias is a force multiplier of ignorance , as if being politically correct can excuse being flat-out wrong .
Few foresaw the 2008 economic meltdown , much less the prior disastrous effect of ensuring government-backed sub-prime-rate mortgage loans to people utterly unable to meet their payments . The subsequent slowest recovery in modern times , after the 2008 meltdown , reminded us that no expert in the Obama administration knew much about “ shovel-ready jobs , ” or why near-zero interest rates , huge stimuli and debt , more regulations , and Obamacare had ossified the economy . The experts who assured us of the supposedly money-saving Affordable Care Act or the wisdom of the Iran deal expressed contempt for the public but delivered little to justify their smugness .
Because so often liberal ideology is deeply embedded within higher education , bias is a force multiplier of ignorance , as if being politically correct can excuse being flat-out wrong . Paul Krugman ’ s prediction of a permanent stock-market crash after Trump ’ s victory or Larry Summers ’ s dismissal of 3 percent growth in the Trump years as a “ fantasy ” did not reveal deep learning or years of high-priced expertise .
Most of the brightest and best-credentialed of our pollsters and pundits squabbled in the closing days of 2016 over how little chance Donald Trump had to get elected . The New York Times on the eve of the voting reported that the most reputable polling firms could not agree on whether Trump had a 15 percent , 8 percent , 2 percent , or less than 1 percent of winning the election . Such pseudo-scientific precision could not cloak the ignorance and political bias of our polling experts .
In truth , elite education has become a cattle brand . It signifies lots of things other than knowledge : for some , politically correct certification ; for others , good test scores and grades that got them in ; for a few , later entry into the alumni ranks of high business , law , academia , government , and the media .
Old-boy networks , alumni giving , affirmative action , sports , and diversity have pretty much put an end to classical meritocratic admissions . That decline of standards in admissions is perversely ironic , because at about the same time , a new campus ethos of grade inflation was predicated on the self-important notion that if you were smart enough to get into Princeton or Harvard , then Harvard and Princeton would make the necessary adjustments and concessions to make sure you graduated .
The result of self-congratulation is that a Stanford graduate now usually knows less history than his Hillsdale counterpart . A successful self-made businessman can know a lot more about the economy than does a Harvard M.B.A. , and a state-college graduate is likely to have better ethical bearings that the Clintons with their Yale Law degrees .
The Trump revolution is often attributed to the angry pushback of the deplorables and irredeemables and all those who lacked the knack for getting with the global agenda . Perhaps . But it was also a popular consensus that our experts in government , the university , and the media were not very expert , and the résumés and letters behind their names increasingly denoted nothing much at all .

Because so often liberal ideology is deeply embedded within higher education, bias is a force multiplier of ignorance, as if being politically correct can excuse being flat-out wrong. Paul Krugman’s prediction of a permanent stock-market crash after Trump’s victory or Larry Summers’s dismissal of 3 percent growth in the Trump years as a “fantasy” did not reveal deep learning or years of high-priced expertise.

Most of the brightest and best-credentialed of our pollsters and pundits squabbled in the closing days of 2016 over how little chance Donald Trump had to get elected. The New York Times on the eve of the voting reported that the most reputable polling firms could not agree on whether Trump had a 15 percent, 8 percent, 2 percent, or less than 1 percent of winning the election. Such pseudo-scientific precision could not cloak the ignorance and political bias of our polling experts.

In truth, elite education has become a cattle brand. It signifies lots of things other than knowledge: for some, politically correct certification; for others, good test scores and grades that got them in; for a few, later entry into the alumni ranks of high business, law, academia, government, and the media.

Old-boy networks, alumni giving, affirmative action, sports, and diversity have pretty much put an end to classical meritocratic admissions. That decline of standards in admissions is perversely ironic, because at about the same time, a new campus ethos of grade inflation was predicated on the self-important notion that if you were smart enough to get into Princeton or Harvard, then Harvard and Princeton would make the necessary adjustments and concessions to make sure you graduated.

The result of self-congratulation is that a Stanford graduate now usually knows less history than his Hillsdale counterpart. A successful self-made businessman can know a lot more about the economy than does a Harvard M.B.A., and a state-college graduate is likely to have better ethical bearings that the Clintons with their Yale Law degrees.

The Trump revolution is often attributed to the angry pushback of the deplorables and irredeemables and all those who lacked the knack for getting with the global agenda. Perhaps. But it was also a popular consensus that our experts in government, the university, and the media were not very expert, and the résumés and letters behind their names increasingly denoted nothing much at all.

What started as a ragtag opposition led by a handful of angry moms is now a sophisticated national movement supported by top donors and strategists on the right. Conservative groups say their involvement already has paid dividends in the form of new members and troves of email addresses.

But that’s just the start.

A draft action plan by the advocacy group FreedomWorks lays out the effort as a series of stepping stones: First, mobilize to strike down the Common Core. Then push to expand school choice by offering parents tax credits or vouchers to help pay tuition at private and religious schools. Next, rally the troops to abolish the U.S. Department of Education. Then it’s on to eliminating teacher tenure.

“This is going to be a huge campaign,” said Whitney Neal, the group’s director of grass-roots activism. She plans to kick it off within weeks with a series of videos that will “connect the dots” between killing Common Core and enacting other conservative priorities.

Americans for Prosperity, an advocacy group backed by the Koch brothers, is pressing similar themes in town hall meetings across the country.

A key battleground: Missouri, where conservatives are pushing to get measures promoting vouchers and ending teacher tenure on the fall ballot. Increasingly, the issues are being linked to Common Core. Concerned Women for America held a conference outside Kansas City, Mo., this weekend that opened with denunciations of Common Core and built to an address by state Sen. Ed Emery, a voucher proponent who has compared the current public education system with slavery because it traps students in government-run schools. Concerned Women, which is part of a Koch-backed network of conservative organizations, will hold additional seminars across the state this month.

Missouri will also host a two-day conference devoted to attacking Common Core at the end of the month.

Supporters of the Common Core standards have plenty of resources to fight back. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has spent $170 million to develop and promote the standards. The Obama administration has pushed them hard. Big Labor and Big Business both back them.

Still, supporters have struggled to counter the critics. They have had trouble even understanding the contours of the smoldering opposition.

That same political calculation is evident in FreedomWorks’ draft plan for an Educational Freedom Campaign.

Williams, Guy Benson, Julio Rosas, ""Cortney OBrien"", Timothy Meads, Leah Barkoukis","The opinions expressed by columnists are their own and do not represent the views of Townhall.com .
What do you think of the proposition that no black youngsters should be saved from educational rot until all can be saved ? Black people can not afford to accept such a proposition . Actions by the education establishment , black and white liberal politicians , and some civil rights organizations appear to support the proposition . Let 's look at it with the help of some data developed by my friend and colleague Dr. Thomas Sowell .
The Nation 's Report Card for 2017 showed the following reading scores for fourth-graders in New York state 's public schools : Thirty-two percent scored below basic , with 32 percent scoring basic , 27 percent scoring proficient and 9 percent scoring advanced . When it came to black fourth-graders in the state , 19 percent scored proficient , and 3 percent scored advanced ( http : //tinyurl.com/y85a4phm ) .
Dr. Sowell compared 2016-17 scores on the New York state ELA test . Thirty percent of Brooklyn 's William Floyd elementary school third-graders scored well below proficient in English and language arts , but at a Success Academy charter school in the same building , only one did . At William Floyd , 36 percent were below proficient , with 24 percent being proficient and none being above proficient . By contrast , at Success Academy , only 17 percent of third-graders were below proficient , with 70 percent being proficient and 11 percent being above proficient . Among Success Academy 's fourth-graders , 51 percent and 43 percent , respectively , scored proficient and above proficient , while their William Floyd counterparts scored 23 percent and 6 percent , respectively , proficient and above proficient . It 's worthwhile stressing that William Floyd and this Success Academy location have the same address .
Similar high performance can be found in the Manhattan charter school KIPP Infinity Middle School among its sixth- , seventh- and eighth-graders when compared with that of students at New Design Middle School , a public school at the same location . Liberals believe integration is a necessary condition for black academic excellence . Public charter schools such as those mentioned above belie that vision . Sowell points out that only 39 percent of students in all New York state schools who were recently tested scored at the `` proficient '' level in math , but 100 percent of the students at the Crown Heights Success Academy tested proficient . Blacks and Hispanics constitute 90 percent of the students in that Success Academy .
There 's little question that charter schools provide superior educational opportunities for black youngsters . In a story The New York Times ran about charter schools earlier this month , `` With Democratic Wins , Charter Schools Face a Backlash in N.Y. and Other States , '' John Liu , an incoming Democratic state senator from Queens , said New York City should `` get rid of '' large charter school networks . State Sen.-elect Julia Salazar , D-Brooklyn , said , `` I 'm not interested in privatizing our public schools . '' The New York Times went on to say , `` Over 100,000 students in hundreds of the city 's charter schools are doing well on state tests , and tens of thousands of children are on waiting lists for spots . ''
One would think that black politicians and civil rights organizations would support charter schools . To the contrary , they want to saddle charter schools with procedures that make so many public schools a failure . For example , the NAACP demands that charter schools `` cease expelling students that public schools have a duty to educate . '' It wants charter schools to `` cease to perpetuate de facto segregation of the highest performing children from those whose aspirations may be high but whose talents are not yet as obvious . '' Most importantly , it wants charter schools to come under the control of teachers unions .
Charter schools have an advantage that some call `` selection bias . '' Because charter schools require parents to apply or enter lotteries for their children 's admission , they attract more students who have engaged parents and students who are higher-achieving and better behaved .
Many in the teaching establishment who are against parental alternatives want alternatives for themselves . In Washington , D.C. , and Baltimore , 25 percent of public-school teachers send their children to private schools . In Philadelphia , 44 percent of teachers do so . In Cincinnati , it 's 41 percent . In Chicago , 39 percent do , and in Rochester , New York , it 's 38 percent . This demonstrates the dishonesty , hypocrisy and arrogance of the elite . Their position is , `` One thing for thee and another for me . ''

When it came to black fourth-graders in the state, 19 percent scored proficient, and 3 percent scored advanced (http://tinyurl.com/y85a4phm).

Dr. Sowell compared 2016-17 scores on the New York state ELA test. Thirty percent of Brooklyn's William Floyd elementary school third-graders scored well below proficient in English and language arts, but at a Success Academy charter school in the same building, only one did. At William Floyd, 36 percent were below proficient, with 24 percent being proficient and none being above proficient. By contrast, at Success Academy, only 17 percent of third-graders were below proficient, with 70 percent being proficient and 11 percent being above proficient. Among Success Academy's fourth-graders, 51 percent and 43 percent, respectively, scored proficient and above proficient, while their William Floyd counterparts scored 23 percent and 6 percent, respectively, proficient and above proficient. It's worthwhile stressing that William Floyd and this Success Academy location have the same address.

Similar high performance can be found in the Manhattan charter school KIPP Infinity Middle School among its sixth-, seventh- and eighth-graders when compared with that of students at New Design Middle School, a public school at the same location. Liberals believe integration is a necessary condition for black academic excellence. Public charter schools such as those mentioned above belie that vision. Sowell points out that only 39 percent of students in all New York state schools who were recently tested scored at the ""proficient"" level in math, but 100 percent of the students at the Crown Heights Success Academy tested proficient. Blacks and Hispanics constitute 90 percent of the students in that Success Academy.

There's little question that charter schools provide superior educational opportunities for black youngsters. In a story The New York Times ran about charter schools earlier this month, ""With Democratic Wins, Charter Schools Face a Backlash in N.Y. and Other States,"" John Liu, an incoming Democratic state senator from Queens, said New York City should ""get rid of"" large charter school networks. State Sen.-elect Julia Salazar, D-Brooklyn, said, ""I'm not interested in privatizing our public schools."" The New York Times went on to say, ""Over 100,000 students in hundreds of the city's charter schools are doing well on state tests, and tens of thousands of children are on waiting lists for spots.""

One would think that black politicians and civil rights organizations would support charter schools. To the contrary, they want to saddle charter schools with procedures that make so many public schools a failure. For example, the NAACP demands that charter schools ""cease expelling students that public schools have a duty to educate."" It wants charter schools to ""cease to perpetuate de facto segregation of the highest performing children from those whose aspirations may be high but whose talents are not yet as obvious."" Most importantly, it wants charter schools to come under the control of teachers unions.

Charter schools have an advantage that some call ""selection bias."" Because charter schools require parents to apply or enter lotteries for their children's admission, they attract more students who have engaged parents and students who are higher-achieving and better behaved.

Many in the teaching establishment who are against parental alternatives want alternatives for themselves. In Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, 25 percent of public-school teachers send their children to private schools. In Philadelphia, 44 percent of teachers do so. In Cincinnati, it's 41 percent. In Chicago, 39 percent do, and in Rochester, New York, it's 38 percent. This demonstrates the dishonesty, hypocrisy and arrogance of the elite. Their position is, ""One thing for thee and another for me.""

So why is a supreme labor activist now annoying the National Education Association, the American Federation of Teachers, and other union defenders of the public-school establishment? At one point, Stern discovered that members of a janitors’ union in his network overwhelmingly supported charter schools as crucial to the success of their children. He started backing families in school-reform battles and served on charter-school boards. He continues to rally opinion in favor of educational experiments. Despite his impeccable left-wing credentials, his labor friends are provoked about that.

You see, teacher unions are pushing hard in a different direction. The strikes they launched in West Virginia in February 2018 subsequently swept the nation.

A bill that would have let millions of people refinance their student loans at a lower interest rate has failed in the Senate, after Republicans objected that it included a tax on the wealthy to pay for it. The measure would have allowed people with older loans to benefit from today's low interest rates.

The bill from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., didn't get past a procedural vote, falling by a 56-38 vote. Called the Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act, it was shot down days after President Obama urged Congress to help ease the burden of student debt.

Noting that her bill had bipartisan support, Warren said today that she would continue the effort to help ""40 million Americans out there who are trying to deal with $1.2 trillion in student loan debt.""

Warren said people with student loans should be on the same footing as homeowners and small businesses that are allowed to refinance their loan obligations.

""Republicans objected to the so-called Buffett Rule, which would increase income tax rates on the rich who make most of their money off investments, so that they would pay the same rate as those earning wages,"" NPR's S.V. Date reports for our Newscast unit.

""Only three Republicans voted with Democrats to proceed with the bill,"" Date says, ""not enough to clear the Senate's 60-vote threshold.""

Republican presidential candidates are still bashing the divisive K-12 standards . Donald Trump recently called the Common Core a “ complete disaster , ” and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz proclaimed they should be abolished — along with the Education Department .
But it ’ s too late . Ask most any third-grader : Just as Education Secretary Arne Duncan , the cheerleader in chief for the Common Core and rigorous standards , prepares to step down , the standards that naysayers love to call “ Obamacore ” have become the reality on the ground for roughly 40 million students — or about four out of every five public school kids .
The math and English standards designed to develop critical thinking have been guiding classrooms for years now , even as the political fight rages on in statehouses and on the campaign trail : Many of today ’ s textbooks , workbooks , software and tests are designed to teach the oft-bashed academic standards and measure whether students are meeting them . The federal Education Department gave them a big boost but never required them , nor can it .
In more than half of all states , millions of students took new standardized tests last spring based on the standards , and the expected uproar over these test scores has n't materialized . The conspiracy theories that Common Core would require monitoring kids via iris scans , force teachers to use porn to help students learn to read or ban teaching cursive have largely quieted .
After years of hand-wringing , very few of the 45 states that fully adopted the standards have attempted a clean break — and those that did found it wasn ’ t easy to do . In Indiana , where Republican Gov . Mike Pence signed a bill last year to ditch the standards , even Common Core haters have said the new ones are just the same standards by a different name .
“ The few states that have rolled it back , when you look at what they ’ ve actually done , the standards they are using are 95 percent the Core standards . It ’ s what we know needs to be taught , ” Melinda Gates said last week .

Republican presidential candidates are still bashing the divisive K-12 standards. Donald Trump recently called the Common Core a “complete disaster,” and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz proclaimed they should be abolished — along with the Education Department.

Story Continued Below

But it’s too late. Ask most any third-grader: Just as Education Secretary Arne Duncan, the cheerleader in chief for the Common Core and rigorous standards, prepares to step down, the standards that naysayers love to call “Obamacore” have become the reality on the ground for roughly 40 million students — or about four out of every five public school kids.

The math and English standards designed to develop critical thinking have been guiding classrooms for years now, even as the political fight rages on in statehouses and on the campaign trail: Many of today’s textbooks, workbooks, software and tests are designed to teach the oft-bashed academic standards and measure whether students are meeting them. The federal Education Department gave them a big boost but never required them, nor can it.

In more than half of all states, millions of students took new standardized tests last spring based on the standards, and the expected uproar over these test scores hasn't materialized. The conspiracy theories that Common Core would require monitoring kids via iris scans, force teachers to use porn to help students learn to read or ban teaching cursive have largely quieted.

After years of hand-wringing, very few of the 45 states that fully adopted the standards have attempted a clean break — and those that did found it wasn’t easy to do. In Indiana, where Republican Gov. Mike Pence signed a bill last year to ditch the standards, even Common Core haters have said the new ones are just the same standards by a different name.

“The few states that have rolled it back, when you look at what they’ve actually done, the standards they are using are 95 percent the Core standards. It’s what we know needs to be taught,” Melinda Gates said last week. She’s the wife of Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, whose foundation has been heavily involved in promoting and implementing the standards.

As Common Core becomes more commonplace in public schools (and in many Roman Catholic schools), some prominent Republicans concede they've lost their battle. Take former Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer. As governor, she signed an executive order banning the use of the words Common Core by state agencies, though the standards themselves were still firmly in place. She wrote in a recent column on the Fox News website that implementation of the standards is “succeeding.”

Outspoken Common Core critic Neal McCluskey of the Cato Institute agrees that the standards are likely here to stay — though that won’t stop his ongoing assault on the Obama administration using billions of dollars in incentives to nudge states to adopt the standards. What might change, he said, is how much states are held accountable for students' mastery of the standards, but “my sense is that most states are going to officially stay with Common Core or something like it.”

That was the case for a public review in the deep red state of Mississippi. Kentucky also found wide support for the standards during a similar review.

Why did Democrats decide to engage in all-out war against an education secretary ? Why devote weeks of phone calls , media interviews , and emotional energy to defeating her rather than one of the other cabinet nominees ?
Some Democrats and mainstream media outlets have focused their opposition on claims that Mrs. DeVos having “ radical ” views . Yet , as New York Times columnist Ross Douthat has noted , Secretary DeVos ’ views are not so different from the Obama administration ’ s pro-charter schools position and are almost identical to the perspectives of centrist Democrats such as Senator Cory Booker .
Other Democrats and media outlets have opposed Mrs. DeVos because she lacks experience as a government bureaucrat or school administrator . They also highlight her inability to answer certain questions during the confirmation hearings .
But are these the real reasons Democratic opposition heightened to a fever pitch ? No .
As opinion pieces in the New York Times and Wall Street Journal have argued , the overheated Democratic opposition is motivated by :
? Some of their party ’ s most deep-pocketed and powerful interest groups—teachers ’ unions—who realize that they will no longer have a near-monopoly on education .
? Their party ’ s upper-middle-class suburbanite constituency , who understand that DeVos ’ charters and vouchers will be attractive to families with financial disadvantages , ethnic minority heritage , or ideological and religious convictions that differ from the mainstream . In other words , private schooling will be accessible to children who are very different than the Democratic Party ’ s upper-middle-class suburbanites .
In response to the Democratic Party ’ s powerful interest groups and upper-middle-class suburbanite constituency , here are four reasons why DeVos may turn out to be a welcome remedy to our nation ’ s educational ills .
1 . Liberation from Bureaucracy . DeVos ’ educational philosophy could enable her to liberate American education from encroachment by federal bureaucracy . Under the Obama administration , the federal government functioned as a giant octopus , bypassing families , communities , and states in order to reach its tentacles into school curriculum , teacher evaluation , values conformity , and even restroom policies . DeVos signals a departure from that era . Her stated educational philosophy suggests that she will not turn Democratic encroachment into Republican encroachment ; instead , she will reduce federal encroachment in order to empower families , local communities , and states .
Much ado has been made about Secretary DeVos ’ Dutch Calvinism . But that ’ s misguided .
Dutch Calvinism is a rich religious tradition that emphasizes the rights and freedoms of families , communities , and religions . For that reason , it finds adherents on the right and on the left .
Additionally , it places an especially high value on education , but emphasizes that a pluralistic society should be tolerant enough to allow diverse families and communities to build their own educational institutions and choose which institution ( s ) their children can attend . Unfortunately , many liberal educators are quite illiberal , unwilling to tolerate any type of educational diversity that undermines the federal government ’ s impulse toward command-and-control .
DeVos ’ educational philosophy would allow financially-disadvantaged children to choose the education that fits their unique needs and abilities . In the current system , the government taxes citizens in order to provide education , but then dictates and determines how the tax money can be used . The message is clear : the federal government—rather than the family or local community—is responsible for shaping the way a child understands and interprets the world .
Under DeVos ’ potential system of vouchers and charters , however , citizens will be able to exercise more influence over their own child ’ s education . They will also be able to send their children to a wider variety of schools , including those that would have been financially prohibitive without the vouchers . This sort of system is supported by prominent intellectuals and educators such as Anthony Bradley and has been supported in the past by Democratic politicians such as Cory Booker .
DeVos ’ critics argued that she wasn ’ t qualified to serve as our new Secretary of Education because she had not served as a teacher , a principal , or an educational policy wonk . Yet , those experiences are not necessary prerequisites for the office . As Michael Petrilli noted , Secretary DeVos has devoted her life energies and financial resources to the cause of education and has interacted extensively with politicians and educational policy makers . Although her path to the post of secretary is different than her predecessors , it is a good path and one that qualifies her .
We already know that DeVos will be an imperfect Secretary of Education -- just as all prior secretaries of education have been . Yet , there are good reasons to believe that she will be successful .
She is a philanthropist who has proven that she cares deeply about education . She holds a philosophy of education that can reduce bureaucracy , increase free thinking , and empower the financially disadvantaged . And , she has the work ethic and the connections to make it happen .
So let ’ s just step back for a moment , cool our fevered brows , and pull for Betsy DeVos as she tries to reform our nations ’ education system .","This week, Democrats made history by forcing Vice President Mike Pence to cast the deciding vote for Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.

In other words, private schooling will be accessible to children who are very different than the Democratic Party’s upper-middle-class suburbanites.

In response to the Democratic Party’s powerful interest groups and upper-middle-class suburbanite constituency, here are four reasons why DeVos may turn out to be a welcome remedy to our nation’s educational ills.

1. Liberation from Bureaucracy. DeVos’ educational philosophy could enable her to liberate American education from encroachment by federal bureaucracy. Under the Obama administration, the federal government functioned as a giant octopus, bypassing families, communities, and states in order to reach its tentacles into school curriculum, teacher evaluation, values conformity, and even restroom policies. DeVos signals a departure from that era. Her stated educational philosophy suggests that she will not turn Democratic encroachment into Republican encroachment; instead, she will reduce federal encroachment in order to empower families, local communities, and states.

2. Freedom of Thought

Much ado has been made about Secretary DeVos’ Dutch Calvinism. But that’s misguided.

Dutch Calvinism is a rich religious tradition that emphasizes the rights and freedoms of families, communities, and religions. For that reason, it finds adherents on the right and on the left.

Additionally, it places an especially high value on education, but emphasizes that a pluralistic society should be tolerant enough to allow diverse families and communities to build their own educational institutions and choose which institution(s) their children can attend. Unfortunately, many liberal educators are quite illiberal, unwilling to tolerate any type of educational diversity that undermines the federal government’s impulse toward command-and-control.

3. Empowerment for the Financially-Disadvantaged

DeVos’ educational philosophy would allow financially-disadvantaged children to choose the education that fits their unique needs and abilities. In the current system, the government taxes citizens in order to provide education, but then dictates and determines how the tax money can be used. The message is clear: the federal government—rather than the family or local community—is responsible for shaping the way a child understands and interprets the world.

Under DeVos’ potential system of vouchers and charters, however, citizens will be able to exercise more influence over their own child’s education. They will also be able to send their children to a wider variety of schools, including those that would have been financially prohibitive without the vouchers. This sort of system is supported by prominent intellectuals and educators such as Anthony Bradley and has been supported in the past by Democratic politicians such as Cory Booker.

4. Facilitation by a Philanthropist

DeVos’ critics argued that she wasn’t qualified to serve as our new Secretary of Education because she had not served as a teacher, a principal, or an educational policy wonk. Yet, those experiences are not necessary prerequisites for the office. As Michael Petrilli noted, Secretary DeVos has devoted her life energies and financial resources to the cause of education and has interacted extensively with politicians and educational policy makers. Although her path to the post of secretary is different than her predecessors, it is a good path and one that qualifies her.

Hope for our Children’s Education

We already know that DeVos will be an imperfect Secretary of Education -- just as all prior secretaries of education have been. Yet, there are good reasons to believe that she will be successful.

She is a philanthropist who has proven that she cares deeply about education. She holds a philosophy of education that can reduce bureaucracy, increase free thinking, and empower the financially disadvantaged. And, she has the work ethic and the connections to make it happen.

education,National Review,2,https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/07/espinoza-decision-victory-religious-schools/,What Are Schools For?,2020-07-01,"Kevin D. Williamson, Zachary Evans, John Mccormack, Kyle Smith, Jim Geraghty, Victor Davis Hanson, Brittany Bernstein","NRPLUS MEMBER ARTICLE I n his excellent new book , Charter Schools and Their Enemies ( full review forthcoming in ███ ) Thomas Sowell advises that it is necessary for us to remind ourselves from time to time of a first truth : “ Schools exist for the education of children . ”
Sometimes , the most obvious truths prove to be the most difficult to implement .
The outrage of the day for the Left is the Supreme Court ’ s decision in Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue , a Blaine amendment case . Montana , like many states , has a “ Blaine amendment ” in its state constitution , a Progressive-era anti-Catholic and anti-immigrant measure that forbids government support of religiously affiliated schools . The Blaine amendment was invoked in a legal challenge to a Montana scholarship program , in which the state offered a tax credit for donors to a fund allowing students to attend private schools of their family ’ s own choosing . An organization called Big Sky began a fundraising campaign , and most of the schools that received Big Sky ’ s scholarships were religious schools , as indeed are the great majority of private schools in Montana . “ Oh , no you don ’ t ! ” said the ghost of the Know-Nothings .
Line up the dominos real straight here : ( 1 ) Some families do not feel that their children are best served by a public school and prefer a private school ; ( 2 ) Private schools generally charge tuition , which some families would have a hard time paying ; ( 3 ) Other people are willing to donate their own money to a fund to help those families send their children to the schools that they believe to be best for them ; ( 4 ) Montana offers a tax credit for such donations , just as it offers tax credits for many other kinds of charitable donations ; ( 5 ) Nina Totenberg has a moral heart attack .
You remember Nina Totenberg : the left-leaning social activist who pretends to cover the nation ’ s courts for National Public Radio , our publicly supported progressive media network . “ As the U.S. Supreme Court has grown more and more conservative , ” she writes , “ it has moved with increasing vigor away from the notion of a strict wall of separation between church and state and toward a greater accommodation of religion. ” That is familiar enough stuff : the extraconstitutional “ wall of separation ” that appears nowhere in our actual founding documents or early legal practice is an inescapable trope of contemporary discourse , if an inescapably stupid one . But that ’ s just the tip of the Totenberg . She continues :
Lily Eskelsen Garcia , the head of the country ’ s largest teachers union , called the decision “ shameful and unacceptable. ” In a statement , she said : “ At a time when public schools nationwide already are grappling with protecting and providing for students despite a pandemic and mounting budget shortfalls , the court has made things even worse opening the door for further attacks on state decisions not to fund religious schools . ”
If Nina Totenberg were a journalist rather than an advocate , she might have felt at least a little compelled to point out that that is pure gobbledygook with no meaningful connection to the question at hand . And what is the question ? It is : What are the schools for ? Answer ? Ask Thomas Sowell : “ Schools exist for the education of children . ”
The Blaine amendments appeal now , and appealed to progressives in the 19th century , for a number of reasons . Public schools are a peerless example of the progressives ’ conception of society as one big factory that can be scientifically managed with a kind of political ( and moral ) Taylorism . ( Frederick Winslow Taylor ’ s Principles of Scientific Management was enormously influential among American progressives . ) Whether the problem is education or health care or pharmaceutical regulation , the factory mindset of progressives favors unified systems characterized by standardization and homogeneity . The idea of lots of different kinds of schools offering lots of different kinds of education — with many of them operating outside of the direct oversight of the central bureaucracy — gives them the willies .
There are some messy complications , too : Progressives in the golden age of progressivism had a religious zeal for science , which often led them in horrifying directions , one of which was eugenics . Eugenics and anti-Catholic bigotry went hand-in-hand for the same reason eugenics and anti-Semitism often have gone hand-in-hand ; i.e. , the reflexive white Protestant horror of poor people with big families . That wasn ’ t just an American thing : William Beveridge , the father of the British welfare state , was a member of the Eugenics Society who wanted to have men on the dole sterilized , proposing that they should be maintained as dependents “ but with complete and permanent loss of all citizen rights — including not only the franchise but civil freedom and fatherhood. ” That was the line of the leading lights of the Liberal Party .
There is a lot of ideology , bigotry , and social anxiety tied up in our education debates .
They do not exist to provide incomes and union dues for Lily Eskelsen Garcia or the campaign contributions for Democrats that those union dues are laundered into . The schools are not there to be social-leveling projects or instruments of political indoctrination . They are not there to provide a theater for secular bourgeois progressives to work out their anxieties about people who are socially , religiously , or economically different from them . They are there to educate children .
In this , Christians do not need “ accommodation. ” American Christians ( and Jews , and Hindus , and Muslims ) simply need a government that will follow its own rules , which do not call for a “ wall of separation ” excluding religious organizations from public goods and benefits but only forbid the creation of a national established church .
( We had established churches at the state level for years without New England degenerating into an unlivable Congregationalist theocracy . )
We Christians have been educating people for a very long time , with pretty good results : The Divine Comedy , the Sistine Chapel , genetics — all of those managed to come into the world before the creation of the United States Department of Education in 1979 . If the state of Montana wants to offer some tax credits to help educate children whose families can not afford the schools they want to send their children to , good for Montana . It is an excellent idea . But religious people do not live their lives and enjoy their liberty at the sufferance of the mighty powers in Helena . It is quite the other way around . And it is worth keeping in mind that we have a First Amendment because certain Christians had the wisdom to demand it . The Baptists got that one right .

Hint: The education of children.

NRPLUS MEMBER ARTICLE I n his excellent new book, Charter Schools and Their Enemies (full review forthcoming in National Review) Thomas Sowell advises that it is necessary for us to remind ourselves from time to time of a first truth: “Schools exist for the education of children.”

Sometimes, the most obvious truths prove to be the most difficult to implement.

The outrage of the day for the Left is the Supreme Court’s decision in Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue, a Blaine amendment case. Montana, like many states, has a “Blaine amendment” in its state constitution, a Progressive-era anti-Catholic and anti-immigrant measure that forbids government support of religiously affiliated schools. The Blaine amendment was invoked in a legal challenge to a Montana scholarship program, in which the state offered a tax credit for donors to a fund allowing students to attend private schools of their family’s own choosing. An organization called Big Sky began a fundraising campaign, and most of the schools that received Big Sky’s scholarships were religious schools, as indeed are the great majority of private schools in Montana. “Oh, no you don’t!” said the ghost of the Know-Nothings.

Line up the dominos real straight here: (1) Some families do not feel that their children are best served by a public school and prefer a private school; (2) Private schools generally charge tuition, which some families would have a hard time paying; (3) Other people are willing to donate their own money to a fund to help those families send their children to the schools that they believe to be best for them; (4) Montana offers a tax credit for such donations, just as it offers tax credits for many other kinds of charitable donations; (5) Nina Totenberg has a moral heart attack.

You remember Nina Totenberg: the left-leaning social activist who pretends to cover the nation’s courts for National Public Radio, our publicly supported progressive media network. “As the U.S. Supreme Court has grown more and more conservative,” she writes, “it has moved with increasing vigor away from the notion of a strict wall of separation between church and state and toward a greater accommodation of religion.” That is familiar enough stuff: the extraconstitutional “wall of separation” that appears nowhere in our actual founding documents or early legal practice is an inescapable trope of contemporary discourse, if an inescapably stupid one. But that’s just the tip of the Totenberg. She continues:

Lily Eskelsen Garcia, the head of the country’s largest teachers union, called the decision “shameful and unacceptable.” In a statement, she said: “At a time when public schools nationwide already are grappling with protecting and providing for students despite a pandemic and mounting budget shortfalls, the court has made things even worse opening the door for further attacks on state decisions not to fund religious schools.”

If Nina Totenberg were a journalist rather than an advocate, she might have felt at least a little compelled to point out that that is pure gobbledygook with no meaningful connection to the question at hand. And what is the question? It is: What are the schools for? Answer? Ask Thomas Sowell: “Schools exist for the education of children.”

The Blaine amendments appeal now, and appealed to progressives in the 19th century, for a number of reasons. Public schools are a peerless example of the progressives’ conception of society as one big factory that can be scientifically managed with a kind of political (and moral) Taylorism. (Frederick Winslow Taylor’s Principles of Scientific Management was enormously influential among American progressives.) Whether the problem is education or health care or pharmaceutical regulation, the factory mindset of progressives favors unified systems characterized by standardization and homogeneity. The idea of lots of different kinds of schools offering lots of different kinds of education — with many of them operating outside of the direct oversight of the central bureaucracy — gives them the willies.

There are some messy complications, too: Progressives in the golden age of progressivism had a religious zeal for science, which often led them in horrifying directions, one of which was eugenics. Eugenics and anti-Catholic bigotry went hand-in-hand for the same reason eugenics and anti-Semitism often have gone hand-in-hand; i.e., the reflexive white Protestant horror of poor people with big families. That wasn’t just an American thing: William Beveridge, the father of the British welfare state, was a member of the Eugenics Society who wanted to have men on the dole sterilized, proposing that they should be maintained as dependents “but with complete and permanent loss of all citizen rights — including not only the franchise but civil freedom and fatherhood.” That was the line of the leading lights of the Liberal Party.

There is a lot of ideology, bigotry, and social anxiety tied up in our education debates.

But: Schools exist for the education of children.

They do not exist to provide incomes and union dues for Lily Eskelsen Garcia or the campaign contributions for Democrats that those union dues are laundered into. The schools are not there to be social-leveling projects or instruments of political indoctrination. They are not there to provide a theater for secular bourgeois progressives to work out their anxieties about people who are socially, religiously, or economically different from them. They are there to educate children.

In this, Christians do not need “accommodation.” American Christians (and Jews, and Hindus, and Muslims) simply need a government that will follow its own rules, which do not call for a “wall of separation” excluding religious organizations from public goods and benefits but only forbid the creation of a national established church.

(We had established churches at the state level for years without New England degenerating into an unlivable Congregationalist theocracy.)

We Christians have been educating people for a very long time, with pretty good results: The Divine Comedy, the Sistine Chapel, genetics — all of those managed to come into the world before the creation of the United States Department of Education in 1979. If the state of Montana wants to offer some tax credits to help educate children whose families cannot afford the schools they want to send their children to, good for Montana. It is an excellent idea. But religious people do not live their lives and enjoy their liberty at the sufferance of the mighty powers in Helena. It is quite the other way around. And it is worth keeping in mind that we have a First Amendment because certain Christians had the wisdom to demand it. The Baptists got that one right.

The Left’s anti-religious hysteria is fundamentally adolescent, an adult (“adult”) extension of tedious teen-aged acting out. It is inescapably unserious — one need only look at the way puerile evangelical atheism derailed the development of a brilliant man such as Christopher Hitchens to see that much. Many of the countries our progressive friends most admire — Denmark, Norway — maintain established churches to this day, and somehow manage not to turn into Afghanistan. A healthy society has many centers of power and many sources of community. A healthy society also recognizes that there is a genuine non-superficial diversity in a population as large and dynamic as ours, and that meeting the educational needs of such a population will require many different kinds of institutions with many different approaches. Christian institutions can be of some help there, as they have been for some centuries now.

The school board voted to close the schools anyway.

The students will now probably have to go to Oakland's government-run schools, which are not as good. We asked to talk to members of the Oakland School Board, but they refused.

“We reiterated to governors this week that we’re here to partner with them,” Pence continued. “I think the president was saying that, if there are aspects of the CDC guidelines that are prescriptive or serve as a barrier to kids getting back to school, we want governors and education officials to know we want to work with them to support their [efforts to reopen.]”

Pence also addressed Trump’s threats this week to cut funding for schools, noting that he is simply pushing to “get kids back to school because that’s where they belong.”

“We know based on what our best health officials tell us that we can do that in a safe and responsible way,” Pence said. “The president is just very serious. He believes and we believe that it is absolutely essential for our children’s academic, social and emotional and nutritional needs to be back in the classroom and we’re going to provide leadership from the federal level to do that.”

He added: “I sense a great desire among governors around the country to find a way forward and we made it very clear to them we’re going to partner with them and give them the resources.”

Meanwhile, Pence also noted that the administration is “encouraged” by the mortality numbers, noting that “the average fatality rate continues to be low and steady.”

Pence said that the mortality rate this week is “90 percent lower than at the height of the pandemic.”

“We pledge to work 24 hours a day to continue to keep our losses low,” Pence said.

Now, however, this leader of a public institution is being sued for constitutional violations. So are some members of Michigan’s archetypal administrative bloat — the ever-thickening layer of social-justice crusaders and orthodoxy enforcers who, nationwide, live parasitically off universities whose actual purpose is scholarship. These include Michigan’s vice-provost for equity and inclusion and the director of the Office of Student Conflict Resolution. Such bureaucrats have professional stakes in finding inequities to rectify and conflicts to resolve.

A splendid new organization, Speech First, headed by Nicole Neily, is not content merely to respond after the fact to violations of students’ constitutional rights. It is suing to invalidate Michigan’s “elaborate investigatory and disciplinary apparatus” that exists “to suppress and punish speech other students deem ‘demeaning,’ ‘bothersome’ or ‘hurtful.'” Speech First’s complaint notes that “the most sensitive student on campus effectively dictates the terms under which others may speak.” The university darkly warns that “bias comes in many forms” and “the most important indication of bias is your own feelings.” Speech First says that Michigan’s edifice of speech regulation, with its Orwellian threats to submit offenders to “restorative justice,” “individual education,” and “unconscious bias training,” amounts to unconstitutional prior restraint speech and is too overbroad and vague to give anyone due notice of what is proscribed.

“Verbal conduct” that “victimizes,” or jeopardizes a “social climate” that is “safe and inclusive”? Such vaporous language must have a chilling effect on humor, parody, satire, or plain speech about almost anything. What constitutes forbidden “cultural appropriation”? You will be told — after someone, encouraged by the administration to do so, has notified law enforcement.

When the Wall Street Journal‘s Jillian Kay Melchior asked Michigan for the records of one year of bias incident reports, “the university thwarted this inquiry by imposing a fee of more than $2,400 for the public records.” If this secretiveness indicates that the university is embarrassed, this is progress.

The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) says bias response teams produce “a surveillance state on campus where students and faculty must guard their every utterance for fear of being reported to and investigated” by bureaucrats. Their profession is the suppression and re-education of those — generally conservatives — whose attitudes and opinions constitute, as Michigan students have learned from Schlissel, “hate.”

FIRE has established a grading system whereby colleges and universities are given green, yellow, or red ratings depending on their commitments to freedom of speech and inquiry. Institutions are increasingly interested in earning FIRE’s green approval. FIRE gives Michigan the red rating that identifies a university that has “at least one policy that both clearly and substantially restricts freedom of speech.”

Frederick M. Hess and Grant Addison of the American Enterprise Institute, writing in National Affairs (“Restoring Free Inquiry on Campus”), note that when, after World War II, the federal government decided to direct scientific and medical research through universities rather than government-run laboratories, there were worries that government might threaten free inquiry on campuses. Today, say Hess and Addison, “ideological homogeneity” in academia is producing “formal policies and practices” whereby “limits on speech and expression have become ingrained in campus culture.” Hess and Addison have a sensible proposal: “Taxpayer funds should not be subsidizing research at higher-education institutions where the conditions of free inquiry are compromised.”

To me, of course, this is a scary trend. To me, a course asking the question of whether or not we should keep using reason and rationality seems about as sensible as a course asking whether or not we should keep using toothpaste. Or drinking water. Or breathing air. In all of these instances, the clear answer to the question is “Of course we should.” We must.

It is obvious that we need reason and rationality. Or, at least, it should be obvious. Since it (apparently) isn’t to some, however, I will explain why. Why, for example, do we not run around our offices flipping over desks and throwing things, even when our feelings are telling us that that’s what we should do? Because reason and rationality tell us that, if we do do so, we will likely lose our jobs and be unable to afford the things we need and want. Reason and rationality keep us employed.

( Vice President Mike Pence , who presides over the Senate , will get to cast the deciding vote after two GOP senators said they will vote no . )
There are two basic charges against DeVos , and one is more serious than the other .
The less serious , though mostly accurate , one is that she is plainly inexperienced . Like Trump entering the Oval Office , she has never overseen a public office or department , much less than one with nearly 5,000 employees . The Department of Education , founded only in 1979 , is the smallest of all cabinet agencies in terms of personnel and budget ( `` just '' $ 73 billion in 2016 ) . This is to say it 's a minor cabinet office that was so unnecessary the coutry somehow got by without one until the waning years of the Jimmy Carter presidency ( in 1980 , Ronald Reagan said he would abolish it if he won ; instead he just massively increased its budget ) . DeVos is a billionaire through marriage , to Dick DeVos , the heir to the Amway fortune , and while she invests in a wide range of more or less interesting businesses ( including Neurocore , which is trying to use biofeedback to cure depression and other ailments ) , she does n't rise to the level of , say , Carly Fiorina in terms of business chops . Similarly , she has never worked at or run a school or district , leaving her devoid of direct experience with education other than as a student and a parent ( which is n't nothing , exactly , but still not much ) .
So that first point is taken : She is inexperienced in running the sort of shop she 's about to take over . But then again , if she 's a competent administrator , that 's really what the job demands . As education analysts such as University of Arkansas ' Jay P. Greene and ███ Foundation 's Lisa Snell have told me , the education secretary has relatively little to do , as most federal funds are pre-committed through funding formulas that are difficult to monkey with very much . What the secretary can do is set a broad agenda and a tone . And that , not her lack of credentials , is why Democratic senators tried to `` hold the floor '' against her . DeVos has been very involved in Republican politics at the national and state levels , where she chaired the Michigan Republican Party and has supported all sorts of school-choice plans .

Making it loud & clear outside the U.S. Capitol today : # NoOnDeVos . Privatizing public edu . will not give every child the chance to succeed pic.twitter.com/ddTnmz0Hhn — Ron Wyden ( @ RonWyden ) February 6 , 2017
Wyden is one of the most reputable people in the Senate—or in Washington politics altogether . Yet he is wrong here , and on multiple counts . The first is that DeVos or Trump is somehow going to `` privatize '' public education . From a libertarian perspective , that may or may not be a good idea ( I know I like the concept of separating the state from education very much ; how do you raise truly independent thinkers otherwise ? ) , but nothing like that is on the table . If you argue that `` privatization '' of public education happens when , say , K-12 students get taxpayer-financed money to go to private schools , your outrage would be better directed to the college-level Pell , student loan , and other financial aid programs that spend $ 130 billion a year , much of it going to private schools with religious affiliations .
Beyond improperly invoking privatization , Wyden 's critique somehow presumes that not privatizing public education—that is , maintaining the status quo—will in fact `` give every child the chance to succeed . '' The fact is that when you look at the long-term assessments of K-12 education , graduating seniors are doing no better now than when the government started collecting data in the early 1970s ( at the same time , American kids are scoring lower than they used to in international comparisons ) .
None of that might matter if , say , we were also spending the same amount of money per pupil that we were in 1973 . But of course that 's not the case . In terms of total expenditures measured in constant dollars , we are spending about more than twice as much per pupil now as we were in the early 1970s ( $ 6,253 vs. $ 13,142 ) . And there 's no question that `` chances to succeed '' are distributed unequally throughout the public school system , with better odds closely tracking the children of wealthier , more-educated parents who attend schools that are more responsive to student needs .
To the extent that lower odds of succeeding are concentrated in poorer , urban districts , the very best fix is to introduce all sorts of programs that give students and parents more choices ( and let 's be clear : Publicly funded charter schools and voucher programs come with oversight , not least of which is that parents can take their kids and the tuition dollars elsewhere ; try doing that when you can only attend a school based on your street address ) . As Arkansas ' Greene has written , it 's true that on average charter schools have a similar academic-performance profile to public schools . But once you start doing apples-to-apples comparisons to students attending charters and public schools ( randomized-control trials or RCTs ) , something very clear presents itself :
I 'm sure that most of the Senate Democrats opposing Betsy DeVos think they are opposing an inexperienced billionaire whose secret dream is to loot public school coffers for…what , exactly ? Some sort of bizarre right-wing agenda , I suppose . DeVos ' brother did start the company called Blackwater , so maybe her dedication to giving poor kids more options than they would otherwise have is really a way of helping her bro staff his mercenary forces ?
Or maybe it 's just a more simple misunderstanding , one rooted in special-interest politics . The Democrats are closely allied with teachers unions , who threatened by any and all changes to the educational status quo . So of course they oppose Betsy DeVos and they will use any club on the ground to beat down her chances . But to the extent that DeVos—and Trump , too , who has been outspoken on the need for more school choice—are in favor of giving more students and more parents more choices when it comes educating their kids , they are on the side of the angels . A recent poll found that 68 percent of Americans favor expanding school choice , including 55 percent of self-described Democrats , 75 percent among Latinos , 75 percent among millennials , and 72 percent among blacks . Contemporary politics may not allow partisans to admit that ( or even see it ) , but for those of us who are neither pro-Trump across the board or always anti-Democratic Party , the conversation surrounding the DeVos nomination is everything that 's wrong with Washington .","With the day-long attempt by Democrats to ""hold the floor"" of the Senate to delay and disrupt the planned confirmation for the next secretary of education mostly in the rearview mirror, it now seems likely that President Trump's controversial nominee, Betsy DeVos, will squeak by on a 50-50 vote. (Vice President Mike Pence, who presides over the Senate, will get to cast the deciding vote after two GOP senators said they will vote no.)

There are two basic charges against DeVos, and one is more serious than the other.

The less serious, though mostly accurate, one is that she is plainly inexperienced. Like Trump entering the Oval Office, she has never overseen a public office or department, much less than one with nearly 5,000 employees. The Department of Education, founded only in 1979, is the smallest of all cabinet agencies in terms of personnel and budget (""just"" $73 billion in 2016). This is to say it's a minor cabinet office that was so unnecessary the coutry somehow got by without one until the waning years of the Jimmy Carter presidency (in 1980, Ronald Reagan said he would abolish it if he won; instead he just massively increased its budget). DeVos is a billionaire through marriage, to Dick DeVos, the heir to the Amway fortune, and while she invests in a wide range of more or less interesting businesses (including Neurocore, which is trying to use biofeedback to cure depression and other ailments), she doesn't rise to the level of, say, Carly Fiorina in terms of business chops. Similarly, she has never worked at or run a school or district, leaving her devoid of direct experience with education other than as a student and a parent (which isn't nothing, exactly, but still not much).

So that first point is taken: She is inexperienced in running the sort of shop she's about to take over. But then again, if she's a competent administrator, that's really what the job demands. As education analysts such as University of Arkansas' Jay P. Greene and Reason Foundation's Lisa Snell have told me, the education secretary has relatively little to do, as most federal funds are pre-committed through funding formulas that are difficult to monkey with very much. What the secretary can do is set a broad agenda and a tone. And that, not her lack of credentials, is why Democratic senators tried to ""hold the floor"" against her. DeVos has been very involved in Republican politics at the national and state levels, where she chaired the Michigan Republican Party and has supported all sorts of school-choice plans.

Given that, Senate Democrats and teachers unions are dead-set against her. The DeVos vote isn't ultimately about whether or not a Detroit billionaire runs a program that accounts for only 10 percent of K-12 spending around the country. (The federal government's influence is magnified by the conditions and rules it attaches to schools that receive any federal money.) It's about DeVos's outspoken support for both the general idea of publicly financed school choice and specific plans. Here, for instance, is Oregon Democrat Ron Wyden, tweeting his disapproval:

The proposed pay hike passed West Virginia ’ s House of Delegates , but the Senate has resisted .

The case in federal court in Boston has pitted the Ivy League school against Students for Fair Admissions, or SFFA, which was founded by an activist opposed to affirmative action policies.

The SFFA’s complaint against Harvard is backed by U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration.

The non-jury trial before U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs has provided a rare look into how the private university chooses about 1,600 students each year from about 40,000 applicants.

John Hughes, a lawyer for SFFA, argued to the judge that admissions data from Harvard showed a strong pattern of bias against Asian-Americans, particularly in terms of so-called “personal ratings,” a measure of abstract qualities such as leadership skills and friendliness.

“That Asian-Americans get worse personal ratings year after year is pretty strong evidence that racial bias has crept into the system,” Hughes said.

Harvard’s lawyers conceded that Asian-Americans indeed had on average received lower personal rating scores in recent years, but maintained this was only one of many factors considered in admissions.

Asian-Americans on average scored higher than other racial groups on some factors, they said.

The plaintiffs had narrowly focused on the personal score in order to find the “Asian penalty” they were looking for, Seth Waxman, one of Harvard’s lawyers, argued.

SFFA’s lawyers said they expected a ruling from the judge between December and March 2019.

These ideas were sold to us as sure-fire remedies for enormous inequities in a public school system whose performance only appears to be relatively low compared to other countries if you ignore the large percentage of poor kids we have .
But the `` education reform '' ad campaign never got two important lessons everyone starting out in the advertising business learns : Never make objective claims about your product that can be easily and demonstrably disproven , and never insult your target audience .
For instance , you can make the claim , `` this tastes great '' because that ca n't be proven one way or the other . But when you claim , `` your kids will love how this tastes , '' and parents say , `` my kids think it tastes like crap , '' you 're pretty much toast . And you make matters all the worse if you respond , `` Well , if you were a good parent you 'd tell your kid to eat it anyway . ''
Those two lessons seem to be completely lost on advocates behind the menu of education policies currently being force-fed to classroom teachers , parents , and school children across the country . As more Americans take a big bite of the education reform sandwich , more choose to spit it out .
The latest serving of education reformy slop was served to us in the pages of The New York Times where , first , one of the paper 's All Purpose Pundits David Brooks repeated false claims about the Common Core and denigrated anyone who disagreed with its agenda as being part of a `` circus . ''
Then the Times published a `` news '' story that completely ignored any well reasoned criticisms of the Common Core and framed the opposition as mostly a political tactic from rightwing factions of the Republican party .
Many have taken to personal blogs and websites , including ███ , to criticize what Brooks and the Times published .
Education historian and university professor Diane Ravitch wrote at her personal blogsite , `` In order to explain a point of view , one must make the effort to hear the voices of critics without caricaturing them . Unfortunately , David Brooks has no idea why anyone would not embrace the Common Core standards . ''
In another post , Ravitch blasted the Times report that characterized Common Core opposition as primarily a Republican political issue , noting the paper 's tendency to report on the standards `` as though no reasonable person could possibly doubt the claims made on behalf of the Common Core . '' She asked , `` How can the nation ’ s 'newspaper of record ' be so seriously indifferent to or ignorant of the major education issue of our day ? ''
Louisiana classroom teacher and prolific blogger Mercedes Schneider wrote at her personal site , `` Brooks ’ opinion is that opponents to CCSS are part of a 'circus ' … Brooks believes he writes about CCSS from an op/ed perch outside of the Big Top . However , his place is in the ring of the many who support CCSS on the unsubstantiated opinion that CCSS is necessary to American public education . ”
Russ Walsh , a retired classroom teacher and reading specialist , took particular offense with Brooks ' statement that `` the [ new ] English standards encourage reading comprehension . '' He countered , `` As far as the 'old standards ' go , they varied widely across states , but I have yet to see one that did not address reading comprehension . ''
Even some reform enthusiasts had problems with the Brooks column . Writing for Education Week , Frederick Hess of the American Enterprise Institute called the writing `` ripped from the talking points of Common Core enthusiasts '' and `` an object lesson in the vapid triumphalism of Common Core boosters .
For sure there is no shortage of bizarre conspiracy theory perspective on Common Core coming from right-wing extremists .
But lazy pundits like Brooks notice those criticisms alone and assume that the `` sensible '' argument is to take up with the Common Core side . A little homework reveals they 've chosen between two ideological opposites rather than striking the middle ground .
Most American 's are n't reflexively opposed to education standards or the Common Core per se . As a recent review of polling by Public Agenda revealed , `` About 8 in ten parents see having national standards in math and science as helpful . A new survey from the education reform group Achieve shows that 69 percent of voters support implementation of Common Core when presented with a description of it . And support is even stronger among African-Americans , Hispanics , and 'public school moms . ' ''
However , `` just 16 percent of voters have read or heard ' a lot ' about the Common Core ; and , among those who have , about 4 in ten oppose it … The growing controversy is 'leaving a more negative 'impression ' among voters , ' '' and `` the percent of people opposed to the Core nearly doubled between 2012 and 2013 . ''
The Common Core was presented to the nation with unreal expectations from the beginning with claims it was a `` game-changer '' that would ensure more students do better in school simply by demanding they strive for new and different standards .
Proponents jumped on board the campaign with all sorts of promises that the standards were a civil rights cause , declaring them to be “ Brown 2.0″ for education – a reference to Brown vs. Board of Education , the landmark Supreme Court case mandating racial integration in public schools .
Skeptics pointed out the promise of the Common Core defied common sense , noting , for instance , that `` raising the bar '' for students who are already struggling is like throwing a kid who doesn ’ t know how to swim into the deep water and then continuously pulling back the shore .
Those more knowledgeable of the empirical research on standards spoke up too , explaining , as Tom Loveless from the Brookings Institute did in the pages of Education Week , `` States have tried numerous ways to better their schools through standards . And yet , good and bad standards and all of those in between , along with all of the implementation tools currently known to policymakers , have produced outcomes that indicate one thing : Standards do not matter very much . '' ( emphasis added )
Diane Ravitch , who had previously been an advocate for national standards , looked at how the Common Core was being sold to the American public and warned , `` To expect tougher standards and a renewed emphasis on standardized testing to reduce poverty and inequality is to expect what never was and never will be … We have a national policy that is a theory based on an assumption grounded in hope . '' ( emphasis added )
Educators on the ground also sounded warnings about the Common Core , as award-winning Long Island school principal Carol Burris did at The Washington Post . `` When I first read about the Common Core State Standards , I cheered , she explained . `` I even co-authored a book , “ Opening the Common Core. ” But her opinion soured as she gradually realized that support for the Common Core included accepting the features that came with it , including more standardized tests that are used to evaluate and fire teachers . Burris realized . `` The promise of the Common Core is dying and teaching and learning are being distorted . The well that should sustain the Core has been poisoned . ''
More recently , opposition to the Common Core has spread to parents . In New York , thousands of parents and teachers , from the lower Hudson Valley all the way upstate to Buffalo , have packed school auditoriums and demanded changes to current education policies that enforce the new standards . At a recent town hall meeting in Long Island , a classroom teacher charged state officials with “ child abuse ” and was roundly cheered by an audience of hundreds of disgruntled parents and educators .
All this unrest prompted U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan to lash out at critics of his agenda by saying they inhabit “ an alternative universe ” and by demeaning them as “ white suburban moms ” who are upset at anything that might reveal “ their child isn ’ t as brilliant as they thought they were . ”
Although Duncan eventually apologized for his remarks , it will do little to quell the anger .
As parent and Connecticut journalist Sarah Darer Littman recently explained , `` Democrats from Arne Duncan on down are trying to frame the growing nationwide revolt by parents , K-12 educators , university professors , and child development specialists as 'Tea Party extremism ' or overwrought 'white suburban moms . ' … Those of us with older children can see the qualitative difference in curriculum since the Common Core roll out began – and we are not impressed . We ’ re angered by the loss of instructional time to testing for a benefit that accrues to testing companies rather than our children . ''
Clearly , the reformers ' ad campaign is no longer working , their jeering response to opposition has inflamed resistance , and now politicians are feeling the heat generated by the pushback .
A recent review of the state of the Common Core by Education Week found , `` a spate of bills in state legislatures calling for the slowdown or abandonment of common-core implementation , or withdrawal from the state assessment consortia designing aligned tests . Although none of the bills that would pull states out of the Common Core so far has garnered enough support to become law – with the notable exception of one in Indiana – a half-dozen states in recent months have pulled out of the coalitions developing common tests . ''
It 's now obvious that advertising claims behind current education policies like the Common Core were never based on strong objective evidence . More Americans are noticing this and objecting . And politicians are likely to get more circumspect about which side of the debate they lean to .
So far , the strategy is to churn out more editorial , along the lines of what David Brooks wrote , to exhort Americans to `` stay the course '' on what is becoming a more obviously failing endeavor .
But as this sloganeering wears thin , we 're likely to get a new and improved `` message '' from the policy elite – a Common Core 2.0 , let 's say , or a `` next generation '' of `` reform . ''
What 's really needed , of course , is to see the marketing campaign for what it really is : a distraction from educational problems that are much more pressing . Why , for example , focus on unsubstantiated ideas like the Common Core rather than do something that would really matter , such as improve instructional quality , reverse school funding cuts that are harming schools , or address the inequities and socioeconomic conditions that researchers have demonstrated are persistent causes of low academic performance ?
But that would require something much more than another marketing campaign . It would mean developing a whole new product .","For years, elites in big business, foundations, well-endowed think tanks, and corporate media have conducted a well-financed marketing campaign to impress on the nation's public schools an agenda of change that includes charter schools, standardized testing, and ""new and improved"" standards known as the Common Core.

Why the change of heart?

The Big Mistake Reformers Make

It's now obvious that advertising claims behind current education policies like the Common Core were never based on strong objective evidence. More Americans are noticing this and objecting. And politicians are likely to get more circumspect about which side of the debate they lean to.

So what's an education reformer to do?

So far, the strategy is to churn out more editorial, along the lines of what David Brooks wrote, to exhort Americans to ""stay the course"" on what is becoming a more obviously failing endeavor.

Teachers union pressure , error-riddled evaluations and a wave of more difficult tests for students have won many teachers a reprieve from the newfangled evaluations during the school year now getting underway .
Teachers have filed suit in a half-dozen states to block complicated new evaluation formulas that in some cases have rated them based on the test scores of students they never taught . Parents have protested that their children have been required to take tests created for the sole purpose of evaluating teachers . One county in Florida is developing 724 new final exams — in classes like welding and P.E .
And after spending millions to develop modern evaluation systems , many states find they ’ re not identifying all that many bad teachers . In Rhode Island , 95 percent of teachers were rated effective or highly effective last year . In Florida and Indiana , it was 97 percent . In Tennessee and Michigan , 98 percent .
“ It would be nice if we could have some kind of objective external measure to say , ‘ This is what constitutes good teaching — or good enough teaching. ’ But the fact is , there ’ s no way the statistical measures can do that , ” said Brian Gill , a senior fellow at Mathematica Policy Research who works on so-called value-added calculations .
Faced with these challenges , the administration has relaxed its aggressive timetables for states to begin evaluating all teachers based on objective measures of student learning , such as standardized test scores . In August , the Obama administration said states could ask for a delay in tying student test scores on new , more rigorous exams to teacher evaluations — though some states don ’ t need it . Education Secretary Arne Duncan said he expects some states will want to delay until the 2015-16 school year , but states can ask for a longer extension . If granted , their work could bleed into 2017 — and into the start of a new presidential administration .
Washington , D.C. — one of the first districts to incorporate student test scores in teacher evaluations — isn ’ t using those scores to rate teachers next year . It ’ s hitting pause to give everyone a chance to get used to new exams linked to the Common Core academic standards . Maryland , New Jersey and Texas are all taking extra time to incorporate student test scores . Washington state legislators have flat-out refused to accept the administration ’ s vision of an acceptable evaluation system . And New Mexico is adjusting its system after flawed evaluations , based on erroneous data , caused an uproar in districts statewide . Teachers burned their evaluations in protest after receiving evaluations they believed were flawed .
The tinkering and pauses shouldn ’ t be a surprise , because implementation is difficult , said Sandi Jacobs , vice president and managing director of state policy at the National Council on Teacher Quality .
“ If my boss told me that we would have a new performance system starting tomorrow , I would lose a night ’ s sleep , ” she said .
Advocates on all sides of education policy debates — including teachers unions — agree the old system of evaluating educators was broken .
Evaluations were often infrequent and superficial . The principal might walk into a classroom , check a few things off a checklist and make sure the classroom was under control .
In 2009 , TNTP — formerly The New Teacher Project — came out with a report that found teachers were being treated as interchangeable parts or “ widgets , ” not professionals . Almost all teachers were rated as good or great — fewer than 1 percent were rated unsatisfactory . Meaningful feedback on how to improve was rare .
Some states got to talking about reform . But the movement didn ’ t really take off until the Obama administration dangled incentives — through Race to the Top grants and No Child Left Behind waivers — for states to toughen up teacher evaluation .
Six years into the Obama administration , most states have made big changes . Evaluations are more frequent and far more complex . Principals must often conduct several highly detailed classroom observations of each teacher each year . Some districts also include factors such as a teacher ’ s absentee rate , feedback from parents and students and peer review by colleagues . Objective measures of student learning — often , test scores — frequently account for 25 percent to 50 percent of the teacher ’ s evaluation .
States have tried to measure student learning in different ways . Some allow teachers to set their own learning goals for students , measuring gains from the first day of school to the last . Others rely on state standardized tests .
But only a third of teachers teach grades or subjects measured by state standardized tests , so administrators use different measures to rate the rest .
One of the more popular formulas to measure teacher effectiveness by state tests is called “ value-added measure , ” or VAM . It attempts to control for variables such as a student ’ s income , race and English-language fluency . The formulas measure student proficiency and student growth over time .
In a recent op-ed for The Washington Post , New Mexico state chief Hanna Skandera and Tennessee state chief Kevin Huffman said teachers unions — critics of value-added measures — are trying to skirt accountability .
National Education Association President Lily Eskelsen García criticizes the formulas for being one-dimensional . There was a year when she had 22 students in a class and another year where she had 39 students . “ Is that factored into a value-added model ? No , ” she said .
Eskelsen García told ███ earlier this summer that “ value-added measures are the mark of the devil. ” And Randi Weingarten , president of the American Federation of Teachers , is famous for the catchphrase , “ VAM is a sham . ”
Many teachers say they find aspects of the new evaluations useful , especially the constructive criticism from mentors who observe them at work . But many also say they are uncomfortable with the emphasis on student test scores .
Teacher protests have accelerated in the last year because the new evaluation systems are coming online at the same time states roll out tough new exams aligned to the Common Core standards . In states that tried the new exams early , student scores plummeted .
Teachers are also anxious because their evaluations increasingly carry high stakes . States are moving to tie tenure and layoff decisions , as well as merit-pay bonuses , to the evaluations .
In June , both the NEA and AFT endorsed a two-year moratorium pushed by the Gates Foundation , proposing a delay in high-stakes consequences tied to Common Core exams for students and teachers . At its national convention this year , the NEA launched a campaign against what it calls “ toxic testing . ”","Teachers have filed suit in a half-dozen states to block complicated new evaluations.

The idea seems simple enough: Identify the best teachers and reward them. Pinpoint the worst and fire them.

That’s been a linchpin of the Obama administration’s education agenda from the start.

Education Secretary Arne Duncan said he expects some states will want to delay until the 2015-16 school year, but states can ask for a longer extension. If granted, their work could bleed into 2017 — and into the start of a new presidential administration.

Some states didn’t wait for Duncan before dialing back.

Washington, D.C. — one of the first districts to incorporate student test scores in teacher evaluations — isn’t using those scores to rate teachers next year. It’s hitting pause to give everyone a chance to get used to new exams linked to the Common Core academic standards. Maryland, New Jersey and Texas are all taking extra time to incorporate student test scores. Washington state legislators have flat-out refused to accept the administration’s vision of an acceptable evaluation system. And New Mexico is adjusting its system after flawed evaluations, based on erroneous data, caused an uproar in districts statewide. Teachers burned their evaluations in protest after receiving evaluations they believed were flawed.

The tinkering and pauses shouldn’t be a surprise, because implementation is difficult, said Sandi Jacobs, vice president and managing director of state policy at the National Council on Teacher Quality.

“If my boss told me that we would have a new performance system starting tomorrow, I would lose a night’s sleep,” she said.

Reforming a broken system

Advocates on all sides of education policy debates — including teachers unions — agree the old system of evaluating educators was broken.

Evaluations were often infrequent and superficial. The principal might walk into a classroom, check a few things off a checklist and make sure the classroom was under control.

( Also on POLITICO: Jindal sues over Common Core)

In 2009, TNTP — formerly The New Teacher Project — came out with a report that found teachers were being treated as interchangeable parts or “widgets,” not professionals. Almost all teachers were rated as good or great — fewer than 1 percent were rated unsatisfactory. Meaningful feedback on how to improve was rare.

Some states got to talking about reform. But the movement didn’t really take off until the Obama administration dangled incentives — through Race to the Top grants and No Child Left Behind waivers — for states to toughen up teacher evaluation.

Six years into the Obama administration, most states have made big changes. Evaluations are more frequent and far more complex. Principals must often conduct several highly detailed classroom observations of each teacher each year. Some districts also include factors such as a teacher’s absentee rate, feedback from parents and students and peer review by colleagues. Objective measures of student learning — often, test scores — frequently account for 25 percent to 50 percent of the teacher’s evaluation.

States have tried to measure student learning in different ways. Some allow teachers to set their own learning goals for students, measuring gains from the first day of school to the last. Others rely on state standardized tests.

But only a third of teachers teach grades or subjects measured by state standardized tests, so administrators use different measures to rate the rest.

One of the more popular formulas to measure teacher effectiveness by state tests is called “value-added measure,” or VAM. It attempts to control for variables such as a student’s income, race and English-language fluency. The formulas measure student proficiency and student growth over time.

In a recent op-ed for The Washington Post, New Mexico state chief Hanna Skandera and Tennessee state chief Kevin Huffman said teachers unions — critics of value-added measures — are trying to skirt accountability.

National Education Association President Lily Eskelsen García criticizes the formulas for being one-dimensional. There was a year when she had 22 students in a class and another year where she had 39 students. “Is that factored into a value-added model? No,” she said.

Eskelsen García told POLITICO earlier this summer that “value-added measures are the mark of the devil.” And Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, is famous for the catchphrase, “VAM is a sham.”

Many teachers say they find aspects of the new evaluations useful, especially the constructive criticism from mentors who observe them at work. But many also say they are uncomfortable with the emphasis on student test scores.

Teacher protests have accelerated in the last year because the new evaluation systems are coming online at the same time states roll out tough new exams aligned to the Common Core standards. In states that tried the new exams early, student scores plummeted.

Teachers are also anxious because their evaluations increasingly carry high stakes. States are moving to tie tenure and layoff decisions, as well as merit-pay bonuses, to the evaluations.

In June, both the NEA and AFT endorsed a two-year moratorium pushed by the Gates Foundation, proposing a delay in high-stakes consequences tied to Common Core exams for students and teachers. At its national convention this year, the NEA launched a campaign against what it calls “toxic testing.”",www.politico.com,left,11EkWhZcWFsKrotj

If you belonged to a club that benefited other members at your expense, would you consider leaving? Would you resent it if the club collected dues from all members but only provided benefits to a select few?

Of course you would. Across the country, voluntary organizations thrive because all of their members derive benefits from joining and participating. Churches, civic associations, and hobbyist groups exist because supporters voluntarily decide these groups merit their time, energy and money.

Only one type of private organization doesn’t play by the same rules.

There hasn't been a school strike in Chicago for 25 years. But the current contract between Chicago teachers and the Chicago Public Schools expires at the end of next week, and tensions between the teachers union, the school district and Mayor Rahm Emanuel are ratcheting higher.

Chicago Teachers Union members outmaneuvered the mayor, school officials and anti-union education groups by overwhelmingly approving a measure that allows teachers to strike if contract negotiations fall flat.

About 90 percent of CTU's membership — nearly 24,000 workers — voted this month to support a strike if one is called.

The dispute has prompted comparisons to Wisconsin, where a firestorm over collective bargaining ultimately resulted in a recall election there earlier this month.

Tensions Running High

CTU President Karen Lewis says the strong vote in Chicago is an indication of the rocky relationship between the union and the school board. It also demonstrates ""the absolute abject lack of respect and scapegoating of teachers, paraprofessionals and clinicians throughout this country,"" she says.

""That's all we hear,"" Lewis says. ""[That] everything that's wrong with the educational system is our fault.""

In the past year, Emanuel stripped teachers of a 4 percent pay raise, and his effort to institute longer school days while sidestepping the union contract has infuriated union members.

Emanuel also wants more privately run charter schools in the city, which the teachers union opposes.

A change in state law also angered teachers. Aimed at preventing a strike, the new law set the threshold for a strike authorization vote at 75 percent — and ruled that those members who don't vote would be considered ""no"" votes.

Michael Bochner, an art teacher at Cesar Chavez Elementary School, says that when teachers learned of the provision, they realized the law was a huge effort to blunt the union's power.

""So here at Chavez, we had 100 percent participation on the first day [of voting], which is much more than we've had for any election ever before,"" Bochner says.

Emanuel denies that his support for the change in the law backfired — but he did acknowledge last week that the strong 90 percent vote is a ""huge number.""

'No Wisconsin Here'

School district and union negotiators are wrangling over wages, class size and other issues. Even so, Emanuel offered a small olive branch last week as he talked about the wide gap in the two sides' proposals for teacher pay raises.

""They deserve it. They've earned it and appropriately have gotten it, and should get it in the future,"" Emanuel said. ""What I want to make sure is our children also have a full day and full school year equal to their full potential, which has not been done to date.""

Much of the problem stems from the ways in which the media covers the plight of younger Americans , especially the supposedly catastrophic amount of student loan debt they have taken on simply to get a college degree which is now , we 're told , a nearly meaningless piece of paper that no longer `` automatically '' guarantees admission to the `` middle class . '' A recent story in The Wall Street Journal exemplifies this approach . It 's titled `` Playing Catch-Up in the Game of Life : Millennials Approach Middle Age in Crisis '' and promises `` New data show they 're in worse financial shape than every preceding living generation and may never recover . '' Mostly , it highlights individuals and couples who have tons of student debt and , as a result , supposedly ca n't buy houses , have kids , or even get married .
In fact , it 's far from clear that crude economics is driving , say , the reduction in fertility rates , which have been dropping for decades everywhere in the world and are tied to increases in female autonomy . And for all the talk about generational poverty , it 's not immediately clear that all is darkness . According to a Pew study in 2018 , millennial households now `` match the highest household income for their age group . '' Throw in higher rates of advanced education , and the future actually looks promising . And it appears that millennials may be better off in various ways than Gen X was at the same stage of life .
In any case , there is so much wrong with the narrative about student loan debt that it 's hard to know where to start . In the first place , more people , including more low-income people , are going to college than ever before and college grads have much higher lifetime earnings and much lower unemployment rates than folks with just a high school diploma , an associate 's degree , or a few years of college . As the economist Scott Winship has written , `` If we 're counting rising student indebtedness on the debt side of the ledger , should n't we count the value of the asset financed by the debt ( human capital ) on the asset side ? '' And despite the aggregate $ 1.5 trillion out there in student debt , the average and median amounts owed by individuals students are hardly breathtaking .
According to data from Lending Tree , for instance , about 70 percent of the class of 2018 took out loans ; their median monthly payment was $ 222 . The average loan amount ( which will be higher than the median ) for graduates with debt was about $ 30,000 . According to Pew :
The median borrower with outstanding student loan debt for his or her own education owed $ 17,000 in 2016 . The amount owed varies considerably , however . A quarter of borrowers with outstanding debt reported owing $ 7,000 or less , while another quarter owed $ 43,000 or more .
So most borrowers are actually acting responsibly . College grads make about 80 percent more than high school grads , so taking on debt is n't stupid . And even though college has been getting more expensive , the wage premium remains high enough that the number of years needed to recoup the price of college has n't increased for decades , according to work done by the New York Federal Reserve :
It 's extremely difficult to get straight answers about many aspects of education-related debt . Often , it 's not clear if the debt for a given year includes loans for grad school , including law school or medical school , which are not just much more expensive but also much more remunerative and optional . Ninety percent of law school grads borrow , for instance , and the average debt load is $ 127,000 for people attending private schools and $ 88,000 for those going to state schools . Three-quarters of med students take out loans that average around $ 200,000 , but the typical doctor makes between $ 150,000 and $ 312,000 per year , so the debt is n't particularly tough to pay back . Should we feel bad for lawyers and doctors ?
It 's obviously preferable to graduate from college with little or no debt . But media accounts inevitably gravitate to people with eye-popping amounts of debt that are nobody 's fault but their own . Worse still , the reports rarely include any sort of detailed information that would allow a reader to get a better sense of the individual 's life choices . Yes , relatively cheap loans doubtlessly entice some people to go to college who would n't if they had to pay higher interest rates ( if student loans were dischargeable in bankruptcy proceedings , interest rates—even those offered by the federal government , which disburses about 90 percent of student loan dollars—would be much higher ) . But ultimately the borrower has to take responsibility for his or her actions . I say that as someone who paid his way through undergraduate and graduate school and sweated blood every time I signed for a student loan . Youth is a time of great folly , yes , but you know exactly how much you 're going to be paying back for exactly how long .
In The Wall Street Journal story , we meet a 32-year-old woman living in Chicago who `` is a renter who is single and earns $ 75,000 a year [ working for the city ] . She also owes $ 102,000 in student loans and $ 10,000 in credit-card debt . '' Her salary is actually kind of great , especially for someone her age . The median household income for Chicago is about $ 53,000 and the median per capita income there is $ 33,000 . She 's got three times the average student debt , but we have no way of knowing where she went to college or whether there 's a grad degree tucked into that .
Making $ 75,000 a year breaks down to $ 6,250 a month . Assume she 's paying 33 percent in total taxes , that brings her monthly take-home pay to about $ 4,200 . Assuming she 's paying 7 percent on her loans , she 's on the hook for about $ 1,200 a month , leaving $ 3,000 to cover rent , food , and everything else . That 's not great , but it 's doable . In real dollars , it 's about $ 20,000 more than I was bringing home in the mid-'90s when I started at ███ and lived in Los Angeles with a non-working spouse and 1-year-old son . Does she have roommates ? Why did she spend so much on college ? Reading this story made me think of last year 's Time cover story on teachers who supposedly had to work two or three extra jobs because they 're `` not paid for the work [ they ] do . '' So much of household finance is tied to spending levels , which are never really discussed .
We also meet a thirty-something couple that `` run a financial-advice website , whittling away at their combined student debt of $ 377,000 . '' What ? One of them is a lawyer , so let 's assume that as much as $ 127,000 of the debt went toward a private school law degree . There 's still a quarter of a million dollars in student debt to account for . The story does n't provide any extenuating circumstances and , to be honest , I ca n't imagine any that would explain such as situation other than really dumb choices . Should we as a society be ready to forgive such mistakes via universal debt relief programs proposed by politicians such as Sens . Elizabeth Warren ( D–Mass . ) and Bernie Sanders ( I–Vt. ) ? That seems like an insult and an outrage to everybody , parent and student alike , who scrimped and saved and went to schools they could afford .
In an Associated Press story about Robert F. Smith , the billionaire who just announced he would pay off all the student debt of Morehouse College 's class of 2019 , we meet a 22-year-old finance major with an inexplicably and shockingly high amount of student debt— $ 200,000 , an amount that would take him 25 years to pay off `` at half his monthly salary , per his calculations . '' When Smith made his pledge during Morehouse 's commencement , the student wept .
`` I do n't have to live off of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches . I was shocked . My heart dropped . We all cried . In the moment it was like a burden had been taken off . ''
Surely I 'm not the only one who 's wondering how the hell someone—a finance major , of all people—ended up $ 200,000 in hock by graduation . The full list price for Morehouse is almost $ 50,000 a year , but the average net price is $ 32,000 after grants and scholarships are factored in . Even if he put all four years on loans , that should be $ 128,000 , not $ 200,000 . More to the point , who would do such a thing ? The average net price of nearby Georgia State is $ 15,000 . Borrowing $ 200,000 for a bachelor 's degree is simply inexplicable .

The 'college for all' era is already here

Going to college in the United States is already a nearly universal experience. By the time the high school class of 2004 turned 26, eight years after high school graduation, 86 percent had enrolled in college, according to an analysis of a nationally representative study from the William T. Grant Foundation.

That's not quite universal — it doesn't count high school dropouts. Still, the 86 percent of students who go to college includes a sizable proportion of high school graduates who didn't initially think they would.

The problem isn't college enrollment — it's college completion. Only about 59 percent of students who started college full-time at a four-year college in 2006 graduated by 2012.

Other nations have continued to improve more quickly. In South Korea, two-thirds of young adults have a college credential.

Can college completion increase more quickly than high school?

High school graduation rates show that progress can be slow and incremental.

In 1940, when starting high school was virtually universal nationwide, graduation rates were only around 50 percent. It took more than 30 years, until the late 1970s, for high school graduation to become anything close to the norm — and graduation rates later fell, only recently hitting an all-time high of 80 percent.

If high school is the example, a significant increase in college graduation rates could be decades, not just years, out on the horizon. But other countries have increased their graduation rates more quickly — Norway, Poland, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom among them.

education,USA TODAY,1,https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/02/12/trump-budget-student-loan-forgiveness-other-aid-chopping-block/4728741002/,Which student loan programs would vanish if Trump's proposed budget goes through?,2020-02-12,,"In Donald Trump 's latest budget , aid for lower-income students and a program that offers relief to workers in public service are on the chopping block .
The $ 4.89 trillion plan , presented to Congress on Monday , would cut the Education Department 's budget by $ 5.6 billion , eking out savings by ending some grants , freezing the maximum amount of others and shifting some payments from the government to borrowers .
A couple of proposals could help those struggling to repay their loans .
The spending plan was criticized by Democrats who control the House and has little chance of going into effect when the new fiscal year starts in October .
`` Most of these changes we have seen the Trump administration propose over the last four years , '' says Antoinette Flores , director of post-secondary education for the Center for American Progress . `` But we 've also seen ... both the House and the Senate overwhelmingly reject these ideas . So the reality of this actually happening is slim . ''
If the plan was approved , borrowers could be burdened with billions of dollars more in debt payments .
The Trump administration proposes scrapping a program that forgives the remaining student debt of teachers , firefighters and others in public service who have made on-time loan payments for 10 years .
The tax credit you need : Millions of Americans miss out on Earned Income Tax Credit
`` Ultimately , it means a higher debt burden , '' Flores says , resulting in $ 52 billion in additional payments for borrowers over a decade .
The possibility of the program being eliminated worries Kelsey Hubbard , 26 , an English teacher in Russellville , Arkansas . She looks at the program as a financial lifeline .
“ I am already budgeting every single penny I make as a teacher , so … not having to make that payment would be amazing , ” says Hubbard , who has roughly $ 35,000 in student loans . “ That ’ s groceries . That ’ s gas . ”
Hubbard learned about the program when she was in graduate school and continued to hear about it from colleagues once she started teaching .
“ It ’ s very commonly talked about and used , ” she says . “ We do not get paid a lot , but you have this security blanket after 10 years . It would take the burden off . ”
The federal government pays the interest on certain government loans , called Stafford loans , while the student borrowers are in school .
Trump 's budget would get rid of that subsidy , adding several hundred dollars to what a student must pay back . It would amount to $ 18 billion in additional costs for borrowers over a decade .
`` There 's no question that students ... would owe more when they graduate from college , '' says Sandy Baum , senior fellow in the center for education , data and policy at the Urban Institute .
It 's doubtful that the loss of the subsidy will become a deal-breaker for people wanting to go to college .
`` If you asked a student , most of them have no idea whether their loans are subsidized or not , '' Baum says .

The $4.89 trillion plan, presented to Congress on Monday, would cut the Education Department's budget by $5.6 billion, eking out savings by ending some grants, freezing the maximum amount of others and shifting some payments from the government to borrowers.

A couple of proposals could help those struggling to repay their loans.

The spending plan was criticized by Democrats who control the House and has little chance of going into effect when the new fiscal year starts in October.

""Most of these changes we have seen the Trump administration propose over the last four years,'' says Antoinette Flores, director of post-secondary education for the Center for American Progress. ""But we've also seen ... both the House and the Senate overwhelmingly reject these ideas. So the reality of this actually happening is slim.''

If the plan was approved, borrowers could be burdened with billions of dollars more in debt payments.

Scrapping student loan forgiveness?

The Trump administration proposes scrapping a program that forgives the remaining student debt of teachers, firefighters and others in public service who have made on-time loan payments for 10 years.

Trump and Social Security:Everything you need to know

The tax credit you need:Millions of Americans miss out on Earned Income Tax Credit

""Ultimately, it means a higher debt burden,'' Flores says, resulting in $52 billion in additional payments for borrowers over a decade.

The possibility of the program being eliminated worries Kelsey Hubbard, 26, an English teacher in Russellville, Arkansas. She looks at the program as a financial lifeline.

“I am already budgeting every single penny I make as a teacher, so … not having to make that payment would be amazing,” says Hubbard, who has roughly $35,000 in student loans. “That’s groceries. That’s gas.”

Hubbard learned about the program when she was in graduate school and continued to hear about it from colleagues once she started teaching.

“It’s very commonly talked about and used,” she says. “We do not get paid a lot, but you have this security blanket after 10 years. It would take the burden off.”

No more subsidized Stafford Loans?

The federal government pays the interest on certain government loans, called Stafford loans, while the student borrowers are in school.

Trump's budget would get rid of that subsidy, adding several hundred dollars to what a student must pay back. It would amount to $18 billion in additional costs for borrowers over a decade.

""There's no question that students ... would owe more when they graduate from college,'' says Sandy Baum, senior fellow in the center for education, data and policy at the Urban Institute.

It's doubtful that the loss of the subsidy will become a deal-breaker for people wanting to go to college.

""If you asked a student, most of them have no idea whether their loans are subsidized or not,'' Baum says.

Eliminating Supplemental Grant?

The proposed budget would do away with the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant.

Trump's plan says the student aid duplicates Pell Grants, the primary federal grant program for low- and moderate-income students.

There were 8.2 million students awarded Pell Grants in fiscal year 2019 compared with 1.7 million who received money through the supplemental grant initiative, according to the Federal Student Aid office of the U.S. Department of Education.

""When you're talking about cutting grant aid, that’s going to ultimately lead to higher borrowing,"" Flores says.

Limits on borrowing?

The Trump administration proposes limits on how much parents of undergraduates can borrow from the federal government to pay for school. It wants to cap how much graduate students can take out in federal loans.

Through the Parent PLUS loans program, parents wouldn't be able to take out more than $26,500 in loans to pay for their children's undergraduate educations. Students whose families reach that threshold could borrow up to $57,500 on their own.

Those in graduate school could borrow a maximum of $50,000 a year and no more than $100,000 during their lifetimes.

Students in expensive graduate programs such as medicine might have to take out private loans to fill in the gap between the federal assistance they receive and the tuition they owe, Flores says.

Income repayment program

Another proposal could help borrowers better manage their debt. It would automatically enroll those who defaulted on their loans into an income repayment program.

Five separate options that determine how much borrowers pay based on their earnings would be consolidated into one plan.

Then, “to further improve and simplify loan repayment, the (budget) proposes auto-enrolling severely delinquent borrowers into the single … plan,’’ the Department of Education says in a summary.

Congress’ passage of the fiscal 2016 omnibus bill last week included a litany of policy initiatives, but failure to attach a critical education act, supporting proven education reform in Washington, D.C., has city educators, parents and students wondering where schools fall on legislators’ agenda.

The Scholarships for Results and Opportunity (SOAR) Act promises to preserve Washington’s diverse and thriving education choice environment, but is set to expire. The bill, passed in October with bipartisan support, allocated up to $20 million in improvement funds for traditional public schools and public charter schools in the city. It also reauthorized the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program (DCOSP), allotting up to $20 million for vouchers for low-income students to attend private schools.

Evidence of the success of the three-sector education and federal partnership had proponents expecting the bill would be attached to the $1.1 trillion omnibus, guaranteeing a five-year reauthorization.

Currently reauthorized through 2016, annual funding for SOAR needs to be appropriated each year and students’ families have highlighted the need for long-term continuation.

A letter signed by more than 500 District school parents stated: “The SOAR Act is an example of what works in education. When we can choose the best public, charter, or private school for our children, there are not only more opportunities to engage in their education, but also for them to achieve greater academic excellence.

I hope to help build on this enthusiasm by engaging an army of local D.C. supporters, all eager to trumpet the success of the program and the need for it to continue.”

According to the National Center for Education Statistics, D.C. students are outpacing the nation in math and reading score gains over time. Fourth-grade students in both D.C. Public Schools and D.C. public charter schools averaged higher proficiency rates in 2015 as compared to 2013 in mathematics; reading performance also increased.

PublicCharter School Board executive director, in a statement released this fall. “We’ve cut the distance between D.C. and the rest of the nation’s performance in half since 2009. We have every expectation that trend will continue.”

Nearly half of the city’s students attend a nationally emulated system of high-performing charter schools. Charter enrollment has grown steadily in the city; and students in the schools generally achieve and graduate at higher rates than their traditional public school peers.

Former Florida Gov . Jeb Bush offered a sweeping school choice-centric education plan Monday with proposals that would allow parents to spend government dollars on the pre-K program of their choice and give college students a $ 50,000 line of credit to pay tuition .
Bush unveiled his plan on Martin Luther King Jr. Day as he fights to stay relevant in a GOP race dominated by Donald Trump , Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio , invoking education as a civil rights issue . His plan also includes allowing federal dollars for schools with many low-income students to follow a child to a new school and doubling federal support for charter schools , which are publicly funded but privately run . His campaign said the plan is budget neutral , and it would cut the federal Education Department by 50 percent , but much of what he wants would likely require congressional approval .
The plan echoes and builds on Bush ’ s time as “ education governor ” in Florida , where he oversaw the creation of some of the nation ’ s first school-voucher programs and was the founder of the state ’ s first — now-closed — charter school .
School choice proposals have been widely embraced by Republicans , but charter schools are popular among some Democrats , too , even though they are widely criticized by teachers unions . Hillary Clinton has been a longtime supporter of charter schools but seemed to shift her view some in November , when she said they “ don ’ t take the hardest-to-teach kids , or , if they do , they don ’ t keep them . ”
In a post on Medium , Bush said his plan honors King ’ s legacy and that “ ensuring every individual has access to a quality education is the great civil rights challenge of our time . ”
Bush ’ s plan is one of the rare ones this election cycle to address in detail K-12 education , which has taken a backseat in the election , though candidates have discussed college affordability issues — Democrats in particular . His proposals would expand education options and practices loathed by many Democrats , including unions , such as spending tax dollars on private schools . They also include ideas that have been proposed and rejected in Congress — such as allowing Title I and special education funding to follow students to another school — and ideas proposed by past GOP candidates . In 2012 , Mitt Romney offered to make federal dollars for special education “ portable . ”
“ The American Dream — the idea that anything is possible through hard work — is threatened by an education system failing to prepare the next generation of children for success , ” Bush wrote .
Bush ’ s campaign said the nation spends $ 22 billion annually on 44 different early childhood programs , though that differs from some estimates . He would tap into those dollars to open the door for families to pick an early childhood program that suits their needs .
His plan would also strengthen the D.C . Opportunity Scholarship Program , which provides vouchers to low-income students in the nation ’ s capital .
Overall , Bush said his plan gives states more flexibility and would encourage quality teaching by giving more money to schools whose teachers achieve good results for low-income students . That ’ s an idea the Obama administration has encouraged in the past .
“ Right now , too many regulations drown the system in compliance costs , wasting valuable resources . We need to give states the flexibility to reform and innovate to meet the unique needs of their students , ” Bush wrote .
Bush ’ s plan makes little mention of the Every Student Succeeds Act , the law Congress passed in December to replace his brother ’ s No Child Left Behind act and returns a great deal of authority to the states .
At both the K-12 and college level , Bush wants to boost transparency .
On the higher education front , Bush embraces the idea of “ skin in the game ” — giving colleges and universities incentives to show that former students are able to pay back their loans . That ’ s an idea that ’ s been discussed to an extent in Congress .
Bush says his plan will also support “ innovative new providers , ” and he wants to create state databases to make apparent to prospective students how well graduates are doing in terms of salary and their ability to get a job .
He supports allowing 529 college savings accounts to be converted into education saving accounts that could be used to fund K-12 schooling and later college or job training . Bush would also allow states to deposit $ 2,500 each year into the account of every child under 5 from a low-income family . And anyone could make a tax-deductible contribution to a student ’ s account .
As part of an education savings account , he said he wants to give all high school graduates access to a $ 50,000 line of credit that they could use for educational and skill-building programs . Students would then repay 1 percent of their income for 25 years for every $ 10,000 they spend .
“ This ensures affordable repayment , removes risk of default and protects students during periods of unemployment , while the [ education savings account ] structure gives students flexibility and the incentive to be cost-conscious , ” Bush said .
It also offers relief to existing borrowers with these promises : a new income-based repayment system , more transparent debt collection , allowing private student loan debt to be discharged by bankruptcy , an extended debt repayment period and an easier transition to income-based repayment programs created under the Obama administration .
Bush has had a keen interest in education policy for decades . When Bush lost his first race for governor in 1994 and helped found a charter school , he developed that interest . In his second — and successful — bid for governor , he used education as a central part of his platform .
During his time as governor , Florida embraced standardized testing and school ratings , started one of the country ’ s first virtual schools , grew charter schools and even began a school voucher program that was ultimately deemed unconstitutional by the Florida Supreme Court . School choice proponents hailed Bush ’ s work in Florida as some of the most aggressive and expansive education policymaking in the country .

'' That 's because the school plans to eliminate the popular class after the spring .
According to The Yale Daily News , the art department has decided that the class might make some students uncomfortable due to the `` overwhelming '' whiteness , maleness , and straightness of the artists who comprise the Western canon ( though that last label may be dubious ) . Indeed , the focus on Western art is `` problematic , '' course instructor Tim Barringer told the student newspaper .
`` I want all Yale students ( and all residents of New Haven who can enter our museums freely ) to have access to and to feel confident analyzing and enjoying the core works of the western tradition , '' said Barringer . `` But I do n't mistake a history of European painting for the history of all art in all places . ''
In its final iteration , the course will `` consider art in relation to questions of gender , class and race and discuss its involvement with Western capitalism , '' according to the latest syllabus . Art 's relationship to climate change will also be a `` key theme . ''
`` I 'm really looking forward to seeing what works the students come up with to counteract or undermine my own narratives , '' said Barringer .
Art students who wish to master the Western canon will still find plenty of other courses that satisfy their interests . But the removal of the introductory course makes it difficult for non-majors with a casual interest in the subject to study it .
`` My biggest critique of the decision is that it 's a disservice to undergrads , '' one student , Mahlon Sorensen , told The Yale Daily News . `` If you get rid of that one , all-encompassing course , then to understand the Western canon of art , students are going to have to take multiple art history courses . Which is all well and good for the art history major , but it sucks for the rest of us . ''
It has become more common in recent years for small cabals of students to rebel against liberal arts curricula that they feel are too focused on Western artists , authors , and thinkers . Students at Reed College , for instance , successfully pressured educators to disband an introductory humanities course . In that case , the activists demanded that all European texts be removed and replaced by non-European books as a form of reparations `` for Humanities 110 's history of erasing the histories of people of color , especially black people . '' Yale 's art department seems to be changing with the times .
It 's good to include more perspectives and to ensure that a liberal arts education is not excessively focused on Europe . But diversity by addition is vastly preferable to diversity by subtraction . When a university eliminates an introductory art class because a tiny number of ideologues object to the whiteness and maleness of it all , it feels like they are declining to teach history because some people do n't like what happened . The West 's outsized influence on the events of the last several centuries may very well be problematic , but that does n't mean it is n't real .","Enrollment has swelled for Yale University's introductory art history course, which covers ""the Renaissance to the present.""

""I'm really looking forward to seeing what works the students come up with to counteract or undermine my own narratives,"" said Barringer.

Art students who wish to master the Western canon will still find plenty of other courses that satisfy their interests. But the removal of the introductory course makes it difficult for non-majors with a casual interest in the subject to study it.

""My biggest critique of the decision is that it's a disservice to undergrads,"" one student, Mahlon Sorensen, told The Yale Daily News. ""If you get rid of that one, all-encompassing course, then to understand the Western canon of art, students are going to have to take multiple art history courses. Which is all well and good for the art history major, but it sucks for the rest of us.""

It has become more common in recent years for small cabals of students to rebel against liberal arts curricula that they feel are too focused on Western artists, authors, and thinkers. Students at Reed College, for instance, successfully pressured educators to disband an introductory humanities course. In that case, the activists demanded that all European texts be removed and replaced by non-European books as a form of reparations ""for Humanities 110's history of erasing the histories of people of color, especially black people."" Yale's art department seems to be changing with the times.

It's good to include more perspectives and to ensure that a liberal arts education is not excessively focused on Europe. But diversity by addition is vastly preferable to diversity by subtraction. When a university eliminates an introductory art class because a tiny number of ideologues object to the whiteness and maleness of it all, it feels like they are declining to teach history because some people don't like what happened. The West's outsized influence on the events of the last several centuries may very well be problematic, but that doesn't mean it isn't real.",www.reason.com,right,HzGudFmL18X9LDz6

What’s happening

In March, millions of college students saw their worlds upended by the coronavirus pandemic. Fears of spreading the virus forced America’s universities to hastily shut down in-person instruction and transition to an ad hoc system of distance learning. With the spring semester ending for many, all eyes have shifted to whether colleges will welcome students back to their campuses in the fall.

There are more than 4,000 higher-education institutions in the U.S. Each is developing its own plans for the fall semester. It’s impossible to know what the state of the pandemic will be in August and September, when the school year typically starts. With students, parents and faculty members eager to know what the coming semester will look like, schools don’t have the luxury of waiting a couple of months to make their decisions.

About two-thirds of colleges are planning for in-person instruction in the fall, according to a database kept by the Chronicle of Higher Education. That doesn’t mean things will be back to normal. A return to school could mean staggered class schedules, no large lectures, and a variety of public health measures interwoven into campus life. Several schools, including the University of South Carolina and Notre Dame, have adjusted the academic calendar so the fall semester will end before Thanksgiving, possibly ahead of an expected winter resurgence on the virus.

Many of the country’s most prestigious private universities are considering a range of scenarios that may include a hybrid of online and in-person instruction.

Why there’s debate

The idea of bringing thousands of students and faculty together on college campuses in the fall has raised significant concern among some epidemiologists. Universities are particularly problematic when it comes to transmission of viruses because of the number of people who filter in and out on a daily basis and the social lives of many college students, some argue. If the virus does prove to be seasonal, low case counts over the summer could provide a false sense of security that may lead to a devastating outbreak if another wave hits near the end of the year.

Distance learning will likely be much more worthwhile in the fall, others say, after schools have had several months to build their programs to replace the hastily thrown together plans they rolled out in March.

Though they acknowledge the potential risks, advocates for bringing students back say a variety of steps can be taken to limit virus transmission. Even a significantly modified version of campus life may be preferable to distance learning, which many students and faculty members have expressed dissatisfaction with. The shift to online education has led many students to consider taking a year off — and educators fear some may never come back.

For some colleges, the decision may be largely financial. Some schools could permanently close if forced to go without income from tuition, events, housing and other on-campus revenue streams for another semester.

Others say there is not a one-size-fits-all policy that could be applied to the country’s incredibly diverse collection of colleges. The decision to open campus may depend on location, nature of the student body, university resources, local laws and a long list of other factors.

What’s next

Most schools that are planning to hold in-person classes in the fall are simultaneously developing backup plans in case coronavirus cases don’t drop over the next few months. The nation's ability to contain the pandemic and monitor future outbreaks will likely play a major role in whether those contingencies prove necessary.

Opinion contributor

There’s a reason why the First Amendment comes first. Our country was founded upon the “first freedoms” it protects. The freedom to express ourselves — through speech, through the press, through assembly, through petition and through faith — defines what it means to be American.

And no American forfeits these freedoms — including the right to pray — to anyone or in any place, especially in public schools. The notion of “separation of church and state” is not an invitation for government to separate people from their faith.

Yet, too many students and too many teachers are separated from their faith while they are in school:

►Utah fourth-grader William McLeod was told by his teacher that wearing ashes in the form of a cross on his forehead, a sign of public penance at the beginning of Lent, was “inappropriate.” The teacher gave William a sanitizing cloth to wipe his forehead clean.

►Kentucky high school sophomore Emily Chaney established a “prayer locker” in her school so that fellow students could submit prayer requests anonymously. A radical secularist group complained, and the local superintendent forced Emily to close her prayer locker.

►In Washington state, longtime high school football coach Joe Kennedy would wait until everyone had cleared the gridiron, take a knee and silently thank God for the opportunity to compete. Coach Kennedy prayed after every game — win or lose — until the school district threw a flag on the praying. Coach Kennedy was suspended and then effectively terminated.

Schools nationwide have gone too far

These incidents indicate that too many champion the part of the First Amendment that bars an “establishment of religion” but choose to ignore the clear admonition against “prohibiting the free exercise” of religion. In fact, the First Amendment doesn’t exist to protect us from religion. It exists to protect religion from government.

This president and this administration are committed to ensuring that all people of faith are free to exercise it. And we know that “exercise” means more than simply “worship.” Much more.

Thanks to President Donald Trump’s leadership, we are adhering to the Constitution, which protects the people’s right to pray in their houses of worship, in their homes and everywhere else — including in public schools. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act was amended in 2002 to ensure that taxpayer-supported schools are following the law when it comes to constitutionally protected prayer in public schools. Under the law, the Department of Education is to issue guidance every two years for states and local communities concerning every student’s and every teacher’s right to pray in public schools.

A total overreach:New push for public school Bible studies classes is an excuse to spread Christian gospel

This guidance had been issued only once. We took action and updated the guidance to reflect the law with respect to religious expression in public schools.

Our new guidance explains that the law requires states to report which of their schools failed to certify that they do not have any policy that denies anyone the right to pray. Students may, for instance, read the Bible during homeroom. They may give thanks to God before lunch or a snack. They can pray a decade or two of the rosary at recess. They can be excused from class to fulfill prayer obligations, such as during Ramadan. Students may organize faith-based clubs as they see fit. Students may invite a local rabbi to preach at an assembly. Teachers can pray in the lounge during a break. And students most certainly may express their faith in homework or other assignments free from discrimination based on religion.

What we plan to do going forward

Our updated guidance now makes clear that the law requires states to have a clear process for students, parents and teachers to report violations of their right to pray. It also notes that the law requires states to notify the department of any complaints against schools alleging violations of the right to pray.

This is but one way we are protecting the free exercise of religion in education. In light of the Trinity Lutheran Supreme Court decision, we are not enforcing unconstitutional prohibitions on school districts contracting with tutors, counselors or other similar secular services simply because of their religious affiliation. We successfully negotiated a consensus position with diverse stakeholders on protecting and respecting religious missions of higher education institutions.

We took down the previous administration’s list, which publicly shamed faith-based schools for requesting assurance of an exemption from Title IX, a 1972 law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex in education. And we are especially eager for the Supreme Court to put an end to the “last acceptable prejudice” made manifest in bigoted Blaine Amendments to 37 state constitutions that deny students the freedom to pursue faith-based education.

Step back, reassess priorities:Evangelical, Muslim, Jewish. It's time we all renew our commitment to religious freedom.

In our fast-paced, noisy world, it is healthy to develop an interior life. To be still, to reflect, to review, to contemplate — to pray. One’s faith is personal, but it doesn’t have to be hidden under a bushel basket. Americans have fought and died for the right to live their faith in all aspects of life.

This administration is — and always will be — committed to ensuring that all believers can live and practice their faith without fear.

Last week, Republican Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski announced that they would vote against Donald Trump’s extremely controversial pick for secretary of education, Betsy DeVos. This rallied the left and put Democrats in a pretty exciting position: in need of just one more Republican vote against DeVos to bring her down. That vote, however, is proving very hard to wrangle.



As we speak, Senate Democrats are in the midst of a “talk-a-thon” against DeVos. They’ve held the Senate floor since it opened at noon and intend to hold it, with a few interruptions, until DeVos’ vote midday Tuesday. One Senate Democrat after another, going well into the night, will deliver a speech about why he or she thinks DeVos would make a rotten education secretary, in order to sway the one additional Republican senator they need to vote her down.

But who would that senator be?

Constituents making their voices heard against DeVos are far more likely to persuade a Republican senator than even the most persuasive speech from a Democratic senator. Murkowski cited constituent feedback as critical in determining her position. And since Murkowski and Collins came out against DeVos last week, the Capitol Hill phone system has been melting with constituent heat for undecided Republican senators.

None of them has budged. Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey was named as a possibility last week; he has since come out with a statement affirming his support. Sens. Jeff Flake, Dean Heller, Thom Tillis, Mike Crapo, John Hoeven, and Rob Portman all took their turns through the same ringer, and all have since said they’ll support DeVos.

This does not mean that it would be in vain to continue calling or writing them urging them to change their minds. If the heat is turned up to an extreme following a senator’s announcement of support, one of those senators could rethink. The idea is for a senator to feel that the trouble he or she would get in with constituents for supporting DeVos would be greater than the trouble with Trump for voting against her.

That’s a high bar to clear, and it’s why Democrats are having such a hard time finding that third Republican defection. It’s not just any vote against DeVos—it’s the one that would seal DeVos’ fate, and embarrass the Trump administration. That vote will be expensive. Earning the lifetime enmity of the new president, as well as falling out of favor with the Republican Senate leadership, would make the would-be 51st senator’s life miserable, without a clear, immediate payoff beyond earning the undesirable title of Democrats’ Favorite Republican Senator. The would-be 51st senator would have to feel that the future of his or her career would be fatally threatened, by some combination of irate constituents and well-funded interest groups, by voting for Betsy DeVos.

Williamson, Victor Davis Hanson, Yuval Levin","California is on the verge of approving a new and sharply left-leaning K-12 curriculum framework for history and social sciences . The move has national implications , since textbooks retooled to fit California ’ s changing history frameworks are often used much more widely .
California ’ s current curriculum is already biased toward modern liberalism , but the new framework takes several giant steps further to the left . On immigration , it is anti-assimilationist ; on family and sexuality , it is radically anti-traditionalist ; on terrorism , it tends to “ blame America first ; ” on the 1960s , it highlights and implicitly lauds the most radical “ black , brown , red , and yellow power movements ; ” on politics , it paints a halo over progressives while perpetrating a hit job on conservatives ; on economics , it elevates Keynesian liberalism and ignores everything else ; on military history , it is silent or slyly antagonistic ; on contemporary politics , it reads like an anti-globalization protest pamphlet .
Put the proposed new California history-social science framework together with the College Board ’ s leftist Advanced Placement history curriculum , and K-12 education in this country could soon be a near-exclusively leftist affair .
Would you like to know why a vast new generation of Americans is infatuated with socialism ? They ’ ve been drinking in leftist ideas since long before college . Now , between the new Advanced Placement curriculum and California ’ s leftist gambit , the space for more traditional approaches to American history and civics may soon be reduced to insignificance .
The alarm bell over California ’ s new history curriculum has been sounded by Hoover Institution Fellow , Williamson Evers . Evers was an Assistant Secretary of Education under President George W. Bush , and over the past 20 years has sat on an impressive number of local and statewide California curriculum-setting and textbook-adoption commissions .
Evers has attacked the proposed new history framework for its one-sided cheerleading for modern liberalism , its silence on America ’ s distinctive characteristics , and its penchant for leftist “ ideological propaganda. ” Evers asks , for example , “ Why do whole sections of the framework read as if they are pamphlets written by anti-globalization street protesters ? ” Evers has slammed the new K-12 framework in its entirety . Here , I ’ m going to do a concentrated critique of the framework ’ s 11th grade American history curriculum .
The 11th grade curriculum promises to focus on “ movements toward equal rights for racial , ethnic , religious , and sexual minorities and women. ” In practice , however , religious minorities receive limited attention . The focus is on racial , ethnic , and sexual minorities—sexual minorities above all . To a considerable degree , conventional political history ( and even the new holy trinity of “ race , gender , and class ” ) has been shoved aside or reduced to a supporting role by “ race , ethnicity , and sexuality . ”
The Hudson Institute ’ s John Fonte and I have argued that the College Board ’ s latest AP U.S. History framework drastically downplays , omits , and distorts the significance of the assimilationist ethos in American history . I wouldn ’ t have thought it possible , but the proposed California framework is even worse than AP on immigration . I think it ’ s fair to characterize California ’ s new curriculum as openly anti-assimilationist .
You can almost see the authors of the framework agonizing as they acknowledge that early 20th century progressives worked to assimilate European immigrants . Assimilation , the framework editorializes , is “ questionable by today ’ s standards that generally embrace having a plurality of experiences in the country… ” Students are instructed to use the supposed oddity of progressive assimilationists to “ think historically ” about what could have produced such an anomaly . The answer , the framework broadly hints , is some combination of racism and unregulated capitalism .
So here , instead of simply presenting the across-the-board political and cultural consensus of the Progressive Era in favor of assimilation , the authors of the framework feel it necessary to insist that the ideal of immigrant assimilation is no longer appropriate , and was probably based on some combination of bigotry and selfishness when it flourished .
The framework offers not a hint of the role played by American democratic ideals in the process of assimilation . Liberty and equality , as articulated in the Declaration of Independence and embodied in our constitutional system , are the glue that binds Americans together , regardless of race or ethnicity . Understanding and embracing this “ American Creed ” is the real key to assimilation , as assimilation has been almost universally understood from the founding through the 1960s . Assimilation as a commitment to the democratic principles that guide our republic is both a powerful historical phenomenon and a key to understanding America ’ s distinctive characteristics . The principle of assimilation also rightly serves as a foundation for successful civic education . The proposed California curriculum not only omits and distorts the historical truth about assimilation , it intentionally makes it all but impossible to introduce a new generation of immigrants to the secret of America ’ s success .
The framework ’ s anti-assimilationist theme is carried through to the 1960s , where radicals and ethnic separatists are featured and presented as part of a benign push for civil rights . The black power movement , with its demands for racial separatism and change “ by any means necessary , ” is portrayed as beneficial , if misunderstood . The violent and still controversial American Indian Movement gets similar treatment .
Most striking of all , El Plan de Aztlan , the charter of the radical group MEChA , the militant separatist organization which aims to “ reconquer ” the American Southwest for Mexico , is also featured as a benign example of sixties civil rights activism . This is a dangerous concession to a group whose activists populate many California schools . It is also the ultimate repudiation of America ’ s assimilationist ethos .
Treatment of lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender ( LGBT ) sexuality—and of sexuality in general—is a novel addition to California ’ s history curriculum . No other 11th grade theme receives more coverage , as the framework goes well beyond an account of the post-sixties gay-rights movement . Students also learn about “ Boston marriages ” during the Progressive Era ( marriage-like relationships between two women , often but not always asexual ) , drag balls during the Harlem Renaissance , and the like .
The subtext is decidedly “ liberationist , ” with a constant implication that traditional morality and family structures are oppressive and outdated . Sometimes the bias is pronounced , as in the section on the AIDS epidemic , where the framework bemoans “ AIDS hysteria ” and the consequent regrettable “ retreat ” from “ sexual liberation movements . ”
No balancing material is offered . For example , it would be easy to add coverage of the marriage movement that emerged in the 1990s , inspired by studies documenting the advantages to children of intact two-parent families . But that , of course , would complicate the liberationist narrative .
America is still actively debating the nature and status of transgenderism . A central question is the extent to which transgenderism ’ s public cause ought to be treated as strictly analogous to the African-American civil rights struggle of the 1960s . The California curriculum has no doubts on that score . For example , it presents Christine Jorgensen , who it calls the “ ’ ex-G.I . transformed into a ‘ blonde beauty ’ through sex-reassignment surgery in 1952 , ” as both an intimation of civil rights struggles to come , and a welcome challenge to the “ sex and gender system ” of the fifties .
The most significant thing about the material on sexuality in the 11th grade history curriculum may be the sheer scope of it , since it tends to crowd out other issues . The general emphasis on social themes greatly weakens the framework ’ s treatment of political , military , and diplomatic history . So , for example , on World War I , students learn nothing of the role of American troops in turning the tide of battle , much less about heroes like Sargent York . They do learn , however , that American soldiers abroad found European ideas about sexuality “ very liberating . ”
The advent of Islamist terrorism gets virtually no substantive treatment in this supposedly updated 11th grade curriculum , although it is mentioned several times in passing . For example , although we learn that the attacks of September 11 , 2001 prompted increased immigration enforcement at the Mexican border , we learn nothing of substance about the greatest foreign attack on American soil , or its aftermath .
The section on the Cold War broadly hints that CIA involvement in the overthrow of the Mossadegh government of Iran in 1953 was responsible for the Iranian Revolution of 1979 , and for the rise of contemporary Islamism in the Middle East as well . This way of looking at the American role in the Iranian coup of 1953 remains highly contested , while the leftist theory that Islamic radicalism is nothing but blowback from America ’ s actions in the Middle East is even more problematic and controversial . So the new 11th grade framework features a thoroughly biased and one-sided treatment of the central foreign policy challenge of our time .
The framework ’ s treatment of foreign and military policy—and of just about everything else—is deeply marked by nostalgia for the radicalism of the 1960s . The framework idealizes the sixties counter-culture ’ s rebellion against Cold War values , and even the radicals ’ rebellion against fundamental American principles . No wonder this curriculum fails to comprehend the role of our founding values in the process of assimilation . In this revised curriculum , the radical movements of the 60s seemed almost to become a new American founding , superseding the original .
The 11th grade framework ’ s attention to the Pacific theater in World War II is the exception that proves the rule , as military history is otherwise absent . The account skips lightly over American victories , concentrating instead on the loss of Bataan , “ one of the most grievous defeats in American military history. ” Somehow the new framework has contrived to teach World War II , America ’ s greatest military victory , in such a way as to have students concentrate on America ’ s most grievous military defeat .
The 11th grade history framework lavishes attention on progressives and Democratic presidents , recounting the expansion of the federal government in the most sympathetic terms . By contrast , Republican presidents are either ignored or painted in a bad light . Students are never offered a coherent explanation of what conservatives believe .
Students learn , for example , that President Theodore Roosevelt “ embodied the progressive sentiment that called upon the government to restore and preserve freedom because the sense was that only by working through the government could the power of big business be countered and would people be protected . ”
The problem is that students never hear the other side of the story . From the conservative perspective , the expansion of the federal government poses its own dangers to freedom and democracy . With the growth of the administrative state , unaccountable bureaucrats usurp the law-making powers of elected representatives , while local control—a central bulwark of freedom under our federalist system—is eroded . In a sense , America ’ s long-running political argument has turned around the question of whether , in what ways , and to what extent the growth of centralized government protects or erodes freedom . The California curriculum gives students the resources to understand only a single side of this debate .
As such , Republican presidents from Calvin Coolidge through Ronald Reagan are painted in caricature , when they are not all but ignored . Reagan , for example , is credited with appealing to social conservatives who sought “ to oppose many safety-net programs. ” Actually , Reagan popularized the use of the term “ safety net ” when he said in 1981 , “ All those with true need can rest assured that the social safety net of programs they depend on are exempt from any cuts . ”
With the Claremont Institute , an academic center based in California , having inspired a deep critique of early 20th century progressivism , and having pioneered the revival of interest in the conservatism of Calvin Coolidge , it should not have been difficult for curriculum writers to do justice to the other side of the political equation .
On economics , as Evers points out , contestable Keynesian explanations for the Great Depression are floated , while explanations offered by the Chicago School ( founded by Nobel Laureate Milton Friedman ) or the Austrian School ( typified by Nobel Laureate F.A . Hayek ) are omitted . Yet previous California content standards called for students to analyze alternative explanations for the Great Depression .
In short , California ’ s proposed new K-12 history and social science curriculum is a carnival of leftist bias and distortion . If it receives final approval , the problem is likely to spread across the country , as publishers forced to meet the demands of the most populous state offer their revised textbooks nationally .
There is still time to oppose these proposed curriculum revisions . The California State Board of Education meets on July 13 of this year to consider final approval . If the changes can not be stopped , states , school districts , and parents who prefer a more fair and traditional approach to American history will need to redouble their efforts to monitor textbook adoption . Textbooks compatible with the new California curriculum should be systematically avoided .
The best long-run solution would be the creation of an educational testing company advised by the finest traditionally-inclined scholars and capable both of competing with the College Board ’ s leftist AP curriculum , and of authorizing and encouraging the creation of new and better American history textbooks .","California is on the verge of approving a new and sharply left-leaning K-12 curriculum framework for history and social sciences. The move has national implications, since textbooks retooled to fit California’s changing history frameworks are often used much more widely.

California’s current curriculum is already biased toward modern liberalism, but the new framework takes several giant steps further to the left.

The focus is on racial, ethnic, and sexual minorities—sexual minorities above all. To a considerable degree, conventional political history (and even the new holy trinity of “race, gender, and class”) has been shoved aside or reduced to a supporting role by “race, ethnicity, and sexuality.”

The Hudson Institute’s John Fonte and I have argued that the College Board’s latest AP U.S. History framework drastically downplays, omits, and distorts the significance of the assimilationist ethos in American history. I wouldn’t have thought it possible, but the proposed California framework is even worse than AP on immigration. I think it’s fair to characterize California’s new curriculum as openly anti-assimilationist.

You can almost see the authors of the framework agonizing as they acknowledge that early 20th century progressives worked to assimilate European immigrants. Assimilation, the framework editorializes, is “questionable by today’s standards that generally embrace having a plurality of experiences in the country…” Students are instructed to use the supposed oddity of progressive assimilationists to “think historically” about what could have produced such an anomaly. The answer, the framework broadly hints, is some combination of racism and unregulated capitalism.

So here, instead of simply presenting the across-the-board political and cultural consensus of the Progressive Era in favor of assimilation, the authors of the framework feel it necessary to insist that the ideal of immigrant assimilation is no longer appropriate, and was probably based on some combination of bigotry and selfishness when it flourished.

The framework offers not a hint of the role played by American democratic ideals in the process of assimilation. Liberty and equality, as articulated in the Declaration of Independence and embodied in our constitutional system, are the glue that binds Americans together, regardless of race or ethnicity. Understanding and embracing this “American Creed” is the real key to assimilation, as assimilation has been almost universally understood from the founding through the 1960s. Assimilation as a commitment to the democratic principles that guide our republic is both a powerful historical phenomenon and a key to understanding America’s distinctive characteristics. The principle of assimilation also rightly serves as a foundation for successful civic education. The proposed California curriculum not only omits and distorts the historical truth about assimilation, it intentionally makes it all but impossible to introduce a new generation of immigrants to the secret of America’s success.

The framework’s anti-assimilationist theme is carried through to the 1960s, where radicals and ethnic separatists are featured and presented as part of a benign push for civil rights. The black power movement, with its demands for racial separatism and change “by any means necessary,” is portrayed as beneficial, if misunderstood. The violent and still controversial American Indian Movement gets similar treatment.

Most striking of all, El Plan de Aztlan, the charter of the radical group MEChA, the militant separatist organization which aims to “reconquer” the American Southwest for Mexico, is also featured as a benign example of sixties civil rights activism. This is a dangerous concession to a group whose activists populate many California schools. It is also the ultimate repudiation of America’s assimilationist ethos.

Treatment of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) sexuality—and of sexuality in general—is a novel addition to California’s history curriculum. No other 11th grade theme receives more coverage, as the framework goes well beyond an account of the post-sixties gay-rights movement. Students also learn about “Boston marriages” during the Progressive Era (marriage-like relationships between two women, often but not always asexual), drag balls during the Harlem Renaissance, and the like.

The subtext is decidedly “liberationist,” with a constant implication that traditional morality and family structures are oppressive and outdated. Sometimes the bias is pronounced, as in the section on the AIDS epidemic, where the framework bemoans “AIDS hysteria” and the consequent regrettable “retreat” from “sexual liberation movements.”

No balancing material is offered. For example, it would be easy to add coverage of the marriage movement that emerged in the 1990s, inspired by studies documenting the advantages to children of intact two-parent families. But that, of course, would complicate the liberationist narrative.

America is still actively debating the nature and status of transgenderism. A central question is the extent to which transgenderism’s public cause ought to be treated as strictly analogous to the African-American civil rights struggle of the 1960s. The California curriculum has no doubts on that score. For example, it presents Christine Jorgensen, who it calls the “’ex-G.I. transformed into a ‘blonde beauty’ through sex-reassignment surgery in 1952,” as both an intimation of civil rights struggles to come, and a welcome challenge to the “sex and gender system” of the fifties.

The most significant thing about the material on sexuality in the 11th grade history curriculum may be the sheer scope of it, since it tends to crowd out other issues. The general emphasis on social themes greatly weakens the framework’s treatment of political, military, and diplomatic history. So, for example, on World War I, students learn nothing of the role of American troops in turning the tide of battle, much less about heroes like Sargent York. They do learn, however, that American soldiers abroad found European ideas about sexuality “very liberating.”

The advent of Islamist terrorism gets virtually no substantive treatment in this supposedly updated 11th grade curriculum, although it is mentioned several times in passing. For example, although we learn that the attacks of September 11, 2001 prompted increased immigration enforcement at the Mexican border, we learn nothing of substance about the greatest foreign attack on American soil, or its aftermath.

The section on the Cold War broadly hints that CIA involvement in the overthrow of the Mossadegh government of Iran in 1953 was responsible for the Iranian Revolution of 1979, and for the rise of contemporary Islamism in the Middle East as well. This way of looking at the American role in the Iranian coup of 1953 remains highly contested, while the leftist theory that Islamic radicalism is nothing but blowback from America’s actions in the Middle East is even more problematic and controversial. So the new 11th grade framework features a thoroughly biased and one-sided treatment of the central foreign policy challenge of our time.

The framework’s treatment of foreign and military policy—and of just about everything else—is deeply marked by nostalgia for the radicalism of the 1960s. The framework idealizes the sixties counter-culture’s rebellion against Cold War values, and even the radicals’ rebellion against fundamental American principles. No wonder this curriculum fails to comprehend the role of our founding values in the process of assimilation. In this revised curriculum, the radical movements of the 60s seemed almost to become a new American founding, superseding the original.

The 11th grade framework’s attention to the Pacific theater in World War II is the exception that proves the rule, as military history is otherwise absent. The account skips lightly over American victories, concentrating instead on the loss of Bataan, “one of the most grievous defeats in American military history.” Somehow the new framework has contrived to teach World War II, America’s greatest military victory, in such a way as to have students concentrate on America’s most grievous military defeat.

The 11th grade history framework lavishes attention on progressives and Democratic presidents, recounting the expansion of the federal government in the most sympathetic terms. By contrast, Republican presidents are either ignored or painted in a bad light. Students are never offered a coherent explanation of what conservatives believe.

Students learn, for example, that President Theodore Roosevelt “embodied the progressive sentiment that called upon the government to restore and preserve freedom because the sense was that only by working through the government could the power of big business be countered and would people be protected.”

The problem is that students never hear the other side of the story. From the conservative perspective, the expansion of the federal government poses its own dangers to freedom and democracy. With the growth of the administrative state, unaccountable bureaucrats usurp the law-making powers of elected representatives, while local control—a central bulwark of freedom under our federalist system—is eroded. In a sense, America’s long-running political argument has turned around the question of whether, in what ways, and to what extent the growth of centralized government protects or erodes freedom. The California curriculum gives students the resources to understand only a single side of this debate.

As such, Republican presidents from Calvin Coolidge through Ronald Reagan are painted in caricature, when they are not all but ignored. Reagan, for example, is credited with appealing to social conservatives who sought “to oppose many safety-net programs.” Actually, Reagan popularized the use of the term “safety net” when he said in 1981, “All those with true need can rest assured that the social safety net of programs they depend on are exempt from any cuts.”

With the Claremont Institute, an academic center based in California, having inspired a deep critique of early 20th century progressivism, and having pioneered the revival of interest in the conservatism of Calvin Coolidge, it should not have been difficult for curriculum writers to do justice to the other side of the political equation.

On economics, as Evers points out, contestable Keynesian explanations for the Great Depression are floated, while explanations offered by the Chicago School (founded by Nobel Laureate Milton Friedman) or the Austrian School (typified by Nobel Laureate F.A. Hayek) are omitted. Yet previous California content standards called for students to analyze alternative explanations for the Great Depression.

In short, California’s proposed new K-12 history and social science curriculum is a carnival of leftist bias and distortion. If it receives final approval, the problem is likely to spread across the country, as publishers forced to meet the demands of the most populous state offer their revised textbooks nationally.

There is still time to oppose these proposed curriculum revisions. The California State Board of Education meets on July 13 of this year to consider final approval. If the changes cannot be stopped, states, school districts, and parents who prefer a more fair and traditional approach to American history will need to redouble their efforts to monitor textbook adoption. Textbooks compatible with the new California curriculum should be systematically avoided.

The best long-run solution would be the creation of an educational testing company advised by the finest traditionally-inclined scholars and capable both of competing with the College Board’s leftist AP curriculum, and of authorizing and encouraging the creation of new and better American history textbooks.

Teachers in Chicago walked off the job Monday after contract negotiations fell through, leaving 400,000 students in the nation's third-largest district shut out of their classrooms.

Contract talks broke down late last night, and by Monday morning Chicago public school teachers, many wearing red T-shirts and carrying signs, were picketing around the city for the first time in a quarter-century.

At a news conference late Sunday, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel called the teachers' move a ""strike of choice.""

Emanuel says the union walked away from the table too soon.

""We're down to two issues. Finish it! Let the kids go back where they belong,"" he said late Sunday. ""This is not the right thing to do to the children. It's unnecessary. It's avoidable and it's wrong.""

education,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/2018/6/14/17458710/new-york-shsat-test-asian-protest,The fraught racial politics of entrance exams for elite high schools,2018-06-14,"Alvin Chang, Alex Ward, Matthew Yglesias, Terry Nguyen, Tara Golshan, Mark Dent","Last week , New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio proposed a drastic change in the way students are admitted to the city ’ s elite high schools .
Students gain entry to one of these eight “ specialized ” schools by scoring high enough on a single exam called the Specialized High School Admissions Test ( SHSAT ) . De Blasio has called for phasing out the exam and instead admitting the top students from each middle school .
This has prompted protests from Asian Americans who feel this policy disproportionately hurts them , as well as hand-wringing from graduates of these schools , who believe the move will lower the quality of the education at these institutions .
For decades , these elite schools have been a prime example of what a great secondary education could offer — but also a symbol of how rigged the system is . Since the 1970s , students , school officials , and even the US Office of Civil Rights have said that the admissions process hurts students of color .
Today , about 70 percent of New York high schools are black and Hispanic — but they account for just 10 percent of students in New York ’ s specialized high schools .
By phasing out the test , de Blasio ’ s plan starts a process that would eventually make these schools about 45 percent black and Hispanic — much closer to citywide demographics .
And the city predicts it will offer fewer seats to white students — but also significantly fewer seats to Asian students .
For many Asian Americans , the entrance exam represents their best bet to get a fair shot . You don ’ t need connections , you don ’ t need to be socially adept , and you aren ’ t judged by vague and subjective standards . Ace this test and you ’ re in .
But it ’ s tough to argue the current admissions process is fair — and not only because of the disproportionate demographics . Testing may seem like an objective process , but it often replicates the inequalities that public education is supposed to remedy . Indeed , the current system was put into law in the 1970s when white parents urged the state to institute a test-only system — a campaign that itself was pushing back against proposed changes to the process that would have admitted more black and Puerto Rican students to the schools .
This tension often hides in the subtext of political debates . Now it ’ s being spoken out loud .
” [ De Blasio ] never had this problem when Stuyvesant [ High School ] was all white . He never had this problem when Stuyvesant was all Jewish , ” Kenneth Chiu , the chair of the New York City Asian-American Democratic Club , told NY1 . Stuyvesant is one of New York ’ s eight specialized schools .
” All of a sudden , they see one too many Chinese and they say , ‘ Hey , it isn ’ t right . ’ ”
Until now , the affirmative action debate has been squarely focused on elite college admissions .
For decades , Asian Americans have been accusing top colleges of imposing illegal quotas on Asian students , limiting the number of spots for them even as those institutions sought to bring in more black and Hispanic students . Opponents of affirmative action have used these grievances to challenge the law . There is currently a lawsuit against Harvard University , as well as a Justice Department investigation into this matter .
The accusations that colleges have quotas often come with the complaint that it means Asian Americans have to compete for a set number of seats among themselves . But applicants don ’ t know everyone else who is applying to Harvard or Yale , and it ’ s hard to pin down where you are on that totem pole .
With de Blasio ’ s plan , however , students will know exactly whom they ’ re competing against , and exactly how the ranking system works .
First , de Blasio wants to reserve 20 percent of seats in specialized schools for students from high-poverty schools who didn ’ t meet the exam cutoff . In the next three years , he wants to phase out the entrance exam entirely and grant admission to students who are in the top 7 percent of each middle school ’ s graduating class , as determined by a combination of grades and state standardized tests .
The plan integrates schools by taking advantage of New York ’ s highly segregated geography .
Students in poor , segregated neighborhoods wouldn ’ t compete against students in rich neighborhoods ; instead , they ’ d compete against their neighbors , which guarantees a certain number of seats for each middle school . This is similar to the way the University of Texas has achieved diversity goals , which survived Supreme Court scrutiny in 2016 . The change would also end up capping the number of students from any given school .
All of this is by design — and , in fact , it ’ s the narrow way in which the Supreme Court said districts could pursue diversity .
In recent years , the number of Asian-Americans students has grown sharply at specialized schools , and it ’ s left fewer seats for black and Hispanic students . This plan would push back against that trend .
When New York City ’ s new chancellor , Richard Carranza , was asked whether this plan pits minority groups against each other , he said , “ I just don ’ t buy into the narrative that any one ethnic group owns admission to these schools . ”
But Asian-American leaders who oppose de Blasio ’ s plan insist their presence in specialized schools isn ’ t a sign of privilege .
Soo Kim , president of the Stuyvesant Alumni Association , told the New York Times , “ Stuyvesant is an option for those who have no option . They don ’ t know how to interview or influence their way into the right public schools or the right private schools . ”
One specialized high school student told the New York Times in 2012 , “ Most of our parents don ’ t believe in ‘ gifted. ’ It ’ s all about hard work . ”
This narrative is one that so many immigrants children have heard . It ’ s about being told to work harder than everyone else , because we are perpetual foreigners who will never be gifted anything . It ’ s why an exam-only process is so appealing ; there are no subjective judgments of character or culture — just right or wrong answers no one can dispute . It ’ s the context behind the growth of test prep services .
As Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen puts it , “ They study . They study hard . ”
This way of thinking , of course , implies everyone else isn ’ t working hard enough — and that ’ s why everyone else isn ’ t getting ahead . And this test affirms that belief .
It ’ s worth taking a step back and remembering that there really is something awry with the admissions process at specialized schools .
Not only does the data clearly show that the test-only system created a subset of highly segregated , elite schools , but this system was put into law by white leaders who specifically wanted to limit the number of black and Puerto Rican students .
So , as Nikole Hannah-Jones argues , if we believe that black and Hispanic children are just as intelligent as white and Asian children , what exactly does this test measure ?
One answer is that it measures who has the resources to prep for this test . Schoolwork isn ’ t enough to prepare you . A large portion of Asian-American students take courses to optimize their scores on the SHSAT , and later they will likely take prep courses for the SAT . This , of course , takes money , time , and access . ( These critiques almost invariably lead to other microaggressions against Asians — that we are too focused on tests and academics , and it doesn ’ t make us well-rounded . Of course , that ’ s exactly what the system incentivized . )
The broader answer is that the test measures how American policies have engineered these racial dynamics .
American policies segregated black and brown families into poor neighborhoods and inadequate schools — and they continue to do so today . These policies have also fueled a massive racial wealth gap that continues to widen .
American policies also created a relatively new Asian-American population . Before the 1960s , US immigration policy was largely anti-Asian . But as the US became more receptive to Asian migration , it favored certain people : relatives of US residents , those with specialized skills , and refugees .
Most of these immigrants couldn ’ t be considered wealthy by any means — especially in New York , where Asians have the highest poverty rate of any racial group .
But most of our families weren ’ t subjected to the same discriminatory policies that have kept black and Hispanic families in intergenerational poverty .
This test , like so many others , appears to disproportionately measure these engineered gaps .
There are other good schools . Why is this fight so charged ?
There are eight specialized schools in New York City that base admission solely on the SHSAT score , the most well-known of which are the Bronx High School of Science and Stuyvesant High School .
Together , these eight schools educate just 5 percent of New York City ’ s 310,000 high school students . There are plenty of other great high schools .
But the fight about affirmative action , especially around elite schools , gets so charged because it ’ s not just about education . As Harvard education professor Natasha Warikoo wrote in her recent book The Diversity Bargain , “ [ These schools ] are especially important for our understanding of meritocracy , because many see admissions to those universities as the ultimate demonstration of merit . ”
Of course , merit is a completely made-up standard . It ’ s not an objective metric ; rather , it reflects our ideals .
After all , in the 1970s , white leaders defined merit to limit the number of nonwhite students at the specialized schools . They believed not abiding by these definitions of merit would “ destroy the quality and special character of the institutions , ” according to a 1971 New York Times story .
But as Politico ’ s Eliza Shapiro reports , the city ’ s analysis shows that this new system wouldn ’ t dramatically change the average test scores or GPAs for specialized school students . In other words , it won ’ t lower the quality of the student body .
Removing the test , however , will change the definition of merit to reflect more equitable ideals .
For decades , New York ’ s elite schools used an exclusionary system to define merit — and Asian Americans have been wildly successful within this system .
Now , for the better — but without their consultation — the definition of merit is changing .","Last week, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio proposed a drastic change in the way students are admitted to the city’s elite high schools.

Indeed, the current system was put into law in the 1970s when white parents urged the state to institute a test-only system — a campaign that itself was pushing back against proposed changes to the process that would have admitted more black and Puerto Rican students to the schools.

This tension often hides in the subtext of political debates. Now it’s being spoken out loud.

”[De Blasio] never had this problem when Stuyvesant [High School] was all white. He never had this problem when Stuyvesant was all Jewish,” Kenneth Chiu, the chair of the New York City Asian-American Democratic Club, told NY1. Stuyvesant is one of New York’s eight specialized schools.

”All of a sudden, they see one too many Chinese and they say, ‘Hey, it isn’t right.’”

The implications of the “Asians work harder” argument

Until now, the affirmative action debate has been squarely focused on elite college admissions.

For decades, Asian Americans have been accusing top colleges of imposing illegal quotas on Asian students, limiting the number of spots for them even as those institutions sought to bring in more black and Hispanic students. Opponents of affirmative action have used these grievances to challenge the law. There is currently a lawsuit against Harvard University, as well as a Justice Department investigation into this matter.

The accusations that colleges have quotas often come with the complaint that it means Asian Americans have to compete for a set number of seats among themselves. But applicants don’t know everyone else who is applying to Harvard or Yale, and it’s hard to pin down where you are on that totem pole.

With de Blasio’s plan, however, students will know exactly whom they’re competing against, and exactly how the ranking system works.

First, de Blasio wants to reserve 20 percent of seats in specialized schools for students from high-poverty schools who didn’t meet the exam cutoff. In the next three years, he wants to phase out the entrance exam entirely and grant admission to students who are in the top 7 percent of each middle school’s graduating class, as determined by a combination of grades and state standardized tests.

The plan integrates schools by taking advantage of New York’s highly segregated geography.

Students in poor, segregated neighborhoods wouldn’t compete against students in rich neighborhoods; instead, they’d compete against their neighbors, which guarantees a certain number of seats for each middle school. This is similar to the way the University of Texas has achieved diversity goals, which survived Supreme Court scrutiny in 2016. The change would also end up capping the number of students from any given school.

All of this is by design — and, in fact, it’s the narrow way in which the Supreme Court said districts could pursue diversity.

In recent years, the number of Asian-Americans students has grown sharply at specialized schools, and it’s left fewer seats for black and Hispanic students. This plan would push back against that trend.

When New York City’s new chancellor, Richard Carranza, was asked whether this plan pits minority groups against each other, he said, “I just don’t buy into the narrative that any one ethnic group owns admission to these schools.”

But Asian-American leaders who oppose de Blasio’s plan insist their presence in specialized schools isn’t a sign of privilege.

Soo Kim, president of the Stuyvesant Alumni Association, told the New York Times, “Stuyvesant is an option for those who have no option. They don’t know how to interview or influence their way into the right public schools or the right private schools.”

One specialized high school student told the New York Times in 2012, “Most of our parents don’t believe in ‘gifted.’ It’s all about hard work.”

This narrative is one that so many immigrants children have heard. It’s about being told to work harder than everyone else, because we are perpetual foreigners who will never be gifted anything. It’s why an exam-only process is so appealing; there are no subjective judgments of character or culture — just right or wrong answers no one can dispute. It’s the context behind the growth of test prep services.

As Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen puts it, “They study. They study hard.”

This way of thinking, of course, implies everyone else isn’t working hard enough — and that’s why everyone else isn’t getting ahead. And this test affirms that belief.

What does this test measure?

It’s worth taking a step back and remembering that there really is something awry with the admissions process at specialized schools.

Not only does the data clearly show that the test-only system created a subset of highly segregated, elite schools, but this system was put into law by white leaders who specifically wanted to limit the number of black and Puerto Rican students.

So, as Nikole Hannah-Jones argues, if we believe that black and Hispanic children are just as intelligent as white and Asian children, what exactly does this test measure?

One answer is that it measures who has the resources to prep for this test. Schoolwork isn’t enough to prepare you. A large portion of Asian-American students take courses to optimize their scores on the SHSAT, and later they will likely take prep courses for the SAT. This, of course, takes money, time, and access. (These critiques almost invariably lead to other microaggressions against Asians — that we are too focused on tests and academics, and it doesn’t make us well-rounded. Of course, that’s exactly what the system incentivized.)

The broader answer is that the test measures how American policies have engineered these racial dynamics.

American policies segregated black and brown families into poor neighborhoods and inadequate schools — and they continue to do so today. These policies have also fueled a massive racial wealth gap that continues to widen.

American policies also created a relatively new Asian-American population. Before the 1960s, US immigration policy was largely anti-Asian. But as the US became more receptive to Asian migration, it favored certain people: relatives of US residents, those with specialized skills, and refugees.

Most of these immigrants couldn’t be considered wealthy by any means — especially in New York, where Asians have the highest poverty rate of any racial group.

But most of our families weren’t subjected to the same discriminatory policies that have kept black and Hispanic families in intergenerational poverty.

This test, like so many others, appears to disproportionately measure these engineered gaps.

There are other good schools. Why is this fight so charged?

There are eight specialized schools in New York City that base admission solely on the SHSAT score, the most well-known of which are the Bronx High School of Science and Stuyvesant High School.

Together, these eight schools educate just 5 percent of New York City’s 310,000 high school students. There are plenty of other great high schools.

But the fight about affirmative action, especially around elite schools, gets so charged because it’s not just about education. As Harvard education professor Natasha Warikoo wrote in her recent book The Diversity Bargain, “[These schools] are especially important for our understanding of meritocracy, because many see admissions to those universities as the ultimate demonstration of merit.”

Of course, merit is a completely made-up standard. It’s not an objective metric; rather, it reflects our ideals.

After all, in the 1970s, white leaders defined merit to limit the number of nonwhite students at the specialized schools. They believed not abiding by these definitions of merit would “destroy the quality and special character of the institutions,” according to a 1971 New York Times story.

And this same rhetoric is being used today.

But as Politico’s Eliza Shapiro reports, the city’s analysis shows that this new system wouldn’t dramatically change the average test scores or GPAs for specialized school students. In other words, it won’t lower the quality of the student body.

Removing the test, however, will change the definition of merit to reflect more equitable ideals.

For decades, New York’s elite schools used an exclusionary system to define merit — and Asian Americans have been wildly successful within this system.

Now, for the better — but without their consultation — the definition of merit is changing.",www.vox.com,left,TV5kHJJFVBYUHq00

If there is a report card on how well the country has succeeded in this challenge , it can be found in the results of two tests that measure the readiness of students to do well in college .
Recent scores for the SAT and ACT reveal just how difficult Mr. Obama ’ s challenge is to achieve . SAT scores were flat in 2013 after two years of decline , while the ACT scores were the lowest in five years .
For the ACT , which is now the more widely used test , nearly a third of students didn ’ t meet any of the four benchmarks ( English , reading , mathematics , and science ) . For the SAT , fewer than half of the test-takers were deemed college-ready .
In an echo of Obama ’ s challenge , David Coleman , president of the College Board that administers the SAT , said the results were a “ call to action , ” saying that even the SAT itself had to improve the way it measures skill levels . “ We must dramatically increase the number of students in K-12 who are prepared for college and careers , ” he said .
On at least two other measures , public schools are succeeding : A higher percentage of students are graduating from high school , and the academic skills of those entering high school have improved . Both are a testament to the national efforts since the 1970s to raise education standards and to measure the quality of each school through state-level testing – despite the ongoing disputes over how to do each .
But training students to be prepared for a post-K-12 education is still a problem . One theme that runs through the many reforms is that parents and teachers need to have higher expectations of students , and not just by raising standards , redesigning curriculum , or conducting regular and rigorous testing . Students respond to a host of incentives , and the most important may be an adult ’ s perception of how well a student can perform .
“ One thing that ’ s so striking is how students will often be surprised that they can do harder work than they thought they could , ” said Mr. Coleman , who was also instrumental in coming up with the Common Core standards now being implemented in most states . ( Those standards were drawn up by the National Governors Association and the Council of Chief State School Officers , not the federal government . )
One leader in raising expectations has been Massachusetts , which has had two decades of success in raising student achievement . The state now ranks alongside Japan and Switzerland in educational quality . Its high school graduates met the Obama standard of being globally competitive .
The tyranny of low expectations also extends to teacher training . In a report this week , the advocacy group Education Trust cited the leading problem in teacher preparation as “ low expectations for who is accepted and who graduates . ”

“ In the same way that states and districts are increasingly holding individual teachers and leaders to higher expectations for performance , states must implement a real system of performance measurement and accountability that holds programs preparing those teachers and leaders to a high standard , ” the report stated .
Most students who went through school can cite a teacher who expected far more of them than they could imagine being capable of delivering . That teacher saw talents and qualities that others didn ’ t . The real challenge for public schools is to expand the ability of all teachers , as well as many parents , to do the same .","In 2009, President Obama asked high school students to “commit to at least one year or more of higher education or career training.” The goal was to improve America’s global competitiveness. If there is a report card on how well the country has succeeded in this challenge, it can be found in the results of two tests that measure the readiness of students to do well in college.

Recent scores for the SAT and ACT reveal just how difficult Mr. Obama’s challenge is to achieve. SAT scores were flat in 2013 after two years of decline, while the ACT scores were the lowest in five years.

For the ACT, which is now the more widely used test, nearly a third of students didn’t meet any of the four benchmarks (English, reading, mathematics, and science). For the SAT, fewer than half of the test-takers were deemed college-ready.

In an echo of Obama’s challenge, David Coleman, president of the College Board that administers the SAT, said the results were a “call to action,” saying that even the SAT itself had to improve the way it measures skill levels. “We must dramatically increase the number of students in K-12 who are prepared for college and careers,” he said.

On at least two other measures, public schools are succeeding: A higher percentage of students are graduating from high school, and the academic skills of those entering high school have improved. Both are a testament to the national efforts since the 1970s to raise education standards and to measure the quality of each school through state-level testing – despite the ongoing disputes over how to do each.

But training students to be prepared for a post-K-12 education is still a problem. One theme that runs through the many reforms is that parents and teachers need to have higher expectations of students, and not just by raising standards, redesigning curriculum, or conducting regular and rigorous testing. Students respond to a host of incentives, and the most important may be an adult’s perception of how well a student can perform.

“One thing that’s so striking is how students will often be surprised that they can do harder work than they thought they could,” said Mr. Coleman, who was also instrumental in coming up with the Common Core standards now being implemented in most states. (Those standards were drawn up by the National Governors Association and the Council of Chief State School Officers, not the federal government.)

One leader in raising expectations has been Massachusetts, which has had two decades of success in raising student achievement. The state now ranks alongside Japan and Switzerland in educational quality. Its high school graduates met the Obama standard of being globally competitive.

The tyranny of low expectations also extends to teacher training. In a report this week, the advocacy group Education Trust cited the leading problem in teacher preparation as “low expectations for who is accepted and who graduates.”

“In the same way that states and districts are increasingly holding individual teachers and leaders to higher expectations for performance, states must implement a real system of performance measurement and accountability that holds programs preparing those teachers and leaders to a high standard,” the report stated.

Findings On Defrauded Student Borrowers,2019-12-11,Cory Turner,"Betsy DeVos Overruled Education Dept . Findings On Defrauded Student Borrowers
Documents obtained by NPR shed new light on a bitter fight between defrauded student borrowers and U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos .
These borrowers — more than 200,000 of them — say some for-profit colleges lied to them about their job prospects and the transferability of credits . They argue they were defrauded and that the Education Department should erase their federal student loan debt under a rule called `` borrower defense . ''
DeVos disagrees : She says most student borrowers still got value from these schools and deserve only partial relief from their federal loans .
Now , internal Education Department memos obtained by NPR show that career staff in the department 's Borrower Defense Unit came down firmly on the side of defrauded borrowers .
The memos show this unit reviewed thousands of borrower complaints against now-defunct , for-profit colleges , including Corinthian Colleges and ITT Technical Institute . Just weeks before DeVos was sworn in as secretary , the unit recommended to the department 's political leadership that these borrowers deserve no less than full relief from their student debts .
One memo , dated Jan. 9 , 2017 , begins : `` Corinthian Colleges , Inc. ( 'Corinthian ' ) consistently represented that all graduates obtained jobs after graduation or , relatedly , that its students were guaranteed employment after graduation . These representations were false and misleading . Accordingly , the Borrower Defense Unit recommends full relief for Corinthian borrower defense ( BD ) applicants . ''
Another memo , dated the next day — Jan. 10 , 2017 — arrived at the same conclusion for California-based students who allege they were lied to by ITT Technical Institute , and likewise recommended full relief .
Until now , these internal department memos have been hidden from public view . Lawmakers had previously requested access to them , but DeVos and her department refused to hand them over . Instead , DeVos has criticized the Obama administration for lack of due diligence in processing borrower defense claims . In a Nov. 7 letter to Rep. Bobby Scott , D-Va. , the chairman of the House education committee , DeVos wrote , `` the clear intent of the prior Administration was to eventually provide blanket relief without review of the facts and evidence . ''
In fact , the memos provide a robust review of the evidence , as well as a thoroughly researched counternarrative to DeVos ' position . Instead of limiting students ' debt relief by arguing , as DeVos does , that defrauded borrowers still got some value from their educations , these memos arrive at a different conclusion : that credits earned from Corinthian and ITT schools are essentially worthless .
`` Hundreds of unprompted student statements confirm that lack of value of an ITT education , as ITT students time and again report that their education was sub-standard and that their degree or affiliation with the school was an impediment rather than an asset as they sought employment , '' reads the Jan. 10 , 2017 , memo . It concludes : `` Given this extensively well-documented , pervasive , and highly publicized misconduct , the Department has determined that the value of an ITT education — like Corinthian — is likely either negligible or non-existent . ... Accordingly , it is appropriate for the Department to award eligible borrowers full relief . ''
The memos also include quotes from individual borrowers . In the Jan , 9 , 2017 , memo , a Corinthian graduate complains , `` I was told I would find a job in my field . ... I 'graduated ' and still ca n't find a job that will honor my degree . ''
`` Employers will not touch me , '' says a borrower quoted in a memo dated Oct. 24 , 2016 . `` After graduating I posted a resume online . I did not receive any responses until I removed [ the school 's name ] from my resume . ''
The education secretary has the authority to override the recommendations of department staff , and DeVos has done just that . On Tuesday , the department unveiled a new plan to calculate how much defrauded students benefited from their educations and thus how much , if any , debt relief they deserve . Under this new model , most borrowers are unlikely to qualify for full relief .
According to the release , the department 's new plan will compare the median earnings of defrauded borrowers to the earnings of students who attended similar programs at other schools . `` If the earnings from the school in question under the [ borrower defense ] application are lower than the median for that program at all comparable schools , then they will be determined to have suffered harm and will receive student loan relief . ''
This new plan , DeVos said Tuesday , `` treats students fairly and ensures that taxpayers who did not go to college or who faithfully paid off their student loans do not shoulder student loan costs for those who did n't suffer harm . ''
DeVos has argued for years that the Obama administration 's full-relief interpretation of the borrower defense rule was too lenient . In a 2017 speech , she said , `` While students should have protections from predatory practices , schools and taxpayers should also be treated fairly as well . Under the previous rules , all one had to do was raise his or her hands to be entitled to so-called free money . ''
When DeVos had to sign off on thousands of borrower defense claims that had already been approved by the previous administration , she added three words below her signature : `` with extreme displeasure . ''
In a statement , Education Department press secretary Angela Morabito tells NPR : `` 'Full relief ' sounds nice , but it really means 'full liability ' for taxpayers – and that 's not fair in cases where a borrower is not entitled to it . That 's why it 's imperative that we consider each Borrower Defense claim individually . To force taxpayers to provide blanket forgiveness would be abandoning our duty to be good stewards of tax dollars . The Department will provide student loan relief to those who qualify for it . ''
DeVos ' new plan is the department 's second attempt at resolving the more than 200,000 outstanding borrower defense claims . The first attempt was blocked in May 2018 by Magistrate Judge Sallie Kim of the U.S. District Court in San Francisco . Kim said the department 's use of income data violated students ' privacy , and she ordered DeVos to stop collecting on the debts of certain Corinthian students . In October , Kim fined DeVos $ 100,000 for contempt of court after it was revealed the department had not stopped collections . The department apologized , calling the collections a mistake , and said it was quickly moving to issue refunds .
It is unclear whether DeVos ' new use of earnings data will also run afoul of the law .

A counternarrative to DeVos' position

Until now, these internal department memos have been hidden from public view. Lawmakers had previously requested access to them, but DeVos and her department refused to hand them over. Instead, DeVos has criticized the Obama administration for lack of due diligence in processing borrower defense claims. In a Nov. 7 letter to Rep.

Another borrower says, ""People just laugh in my face.""

""With extreme displeasure""

The education secretary has the authority to override the recommendations of department staff, and DeVos has done just that. On Tuesday, the department unveiled a new plan to calculate how much defrauded students benefited from their educations and thus how much, if any, debt relief they deserve. Under this new model, most borrowers are unlikely to qualify for full relief.

According to the release, the department's new plan will compare the median earnings of defrauded borrowers to the earnings of students who attended similar programs at other schools.

DeVos' new plan is the department's second attempt at resolving the more than 200,000 outstanding borrower defense claims.
