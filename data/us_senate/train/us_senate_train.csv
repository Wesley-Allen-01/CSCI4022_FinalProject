The bill now heads to the president 's desk for his signature . Joining us is our national political correspondent Mara Liasson to talk more about this . Hey , Mara .
MARTIN : So what happened last night ? Was this expected in the end ?
LIASSON : Well , the last minute hijinks were n't expected . What happened was the effort to fund the government for another year met some pretty strong headwinds from conservatives in the Senate . The last-minute monkey wrench was Ted Cruz 's futile effort to stop President Obama 's immigration actions , and that caused senators who thought they were getting the weekend off to scramble back to Washington . But Cruz 's effort backfired and Harry Reid , the outgoing majority leader , the Democratic leader , was able to take advantage the opening that Cruz 's gambit created by scheduling votes on a couple dozen presidential nominees who will now probably be confirmed this coming week . And that 's probably a lot more nominees than Democrats would 've gotten through the Senate otherwise .
MARTIN : OK , so let 's talk about Ted Cruz . A lot of this was pivoting around him . What was his strategy ? What was he looking for ?
LIASSON : Well , he wanted a vote on the president 's immigration actions . He got one , but he only got 22 votes . That 's about half the current Republican ranks in the Senate , but he lost . His colleagues are hopping mad at him . They think what he did was ineffective , grandstanding . However , he might have been looking outside of Washington to the Tea Party base of the Republican Party . That 's who he will be looking to for support when he runs in the Republican presidential primaries next year .
MARTIN : OK , so were there any winners in all of this ...
LIASSON : I think there were a couple of winners . I think Mitch McConnell , who 's the new Republican leader , won . Even though he was blindsided by Cruz , he came out as an able leader . And he got to make the point that Ted Cruz ca n't fight his way out of a parliamentary paper bag . Harry Reid comes out looking stronger , briefly . He made the most out of his last few minutes as majority leader . And another winner is Elizabeth Warren , Democratic senator from Massachusetts . Her status as the leader of the liberal wing of the Democrat party - what Howard Dean used to call the Democratic wing of the Democratic Party - is enhanced . She voted against the funding bill . She thought it had too many sweeteners for Wall Street . And the chorus calling for her to run for president next year is now louder than ever .
MARTIN : OK , so a lot of deal-making . In the end , they funded the government . Can we learn anything about the future , Mara , through all of this ? What does it say about the next Congress ?
LIASSON : Well , it says a lot of different things . It did lay bare divisions in both parties . We know there are divisions in the Democratic Party and the Republican Party . However , we do know , as you said at the outset , that they did get the government funded . That 's a basic function . It seems crazy to congratulate them for doing it , but given the extreme dysfunction we 've had in the past and the near government shutdowns - the government shutdowns and the near default - maybe that means that next year Congress and the White House will be able to get more things done by working together , even though they 'll also be having a lot of very messy fights and big veto fights .

LIASSON: Well, the last minute hijinks weren't expected. What happened was the effort to fund the government for another year met some pretty strong headwinds from conservatives in the Senate. The last-minute monkey wrench was Ted Cruz's futile effort to stop President Obama's immigration actions, and that caused senators who thought they were getting the weekend off to scramble back to Washington. But Cruz's effort backfired and Harry Reid, the outgoing majority leader, the Democratic leader, was able to take advantage the opening that Cruz's gambit created by scheduling votes on a couple dozen presidential nominees who will now probably be confirmed this coming week. And that's probably a lot more nominees than Democrats would've gotten through the Senate otherwise.

MARTIN: OK, so let's talk about Ted Cruz. A lot of this was pivoting around him. What was his strategy? What was he looking for?

LIASSON: Well, he wanted a vote on the president's immigration actions. He got one, but he only got 22 votes. That's about half the current Republican ranks in the Senate, but he lost. His colleagues are hopping mad at him. They think what he did was ineffective, grandstanding. However, he might have been looking outside of Washington to the Tea Party base of the Republican Party. That's who he will be looking to for support when he runs in the Republican presidential primaries next year.

MARTIN: OK, so were there any winners in all of this...

LIASSON: Yes.

MARTIN: Congressional shenanigans?

LIASSON: I think there were a couple of winners. I think Mitch McConnell, who's the new Republican leader, won. Even though he was blindsided by Cruz, he came out as an able leader. And he got to make the point that Ted Cruz can't fight his way out of a parliamentary paper bag. Harry Reid comes out looking stronger, briefly. He made the most out of his last few minutes as majority leader. And another winner is Elizabeth Warren, Democratic senator from Massachusetts. Her status as the leader of the liberal wing of the Democrat party - what Howard Dean used to call the Democratic wing of the Democratic Party - is enhanced. She voted against the funding bill. She thought it had too many sweeteners for Wall Street. And the chorus calling for her to run for president next year is now louder than ever.

MARTIN: OK, so a lot of deal-making. In the end, they funded the government. Can we learn anything about the future, Mara, through all of this? What does it say about the next Congress?

LIASSON: Well, it says a lot of different things. It did lay bare divisions in both parties. We know there are divisions in the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. However, we do know, as you said at the outset, that they did get the government funded. That's a basic function. It seems crazy to congratulate them for doing it, but given the extreme dysfunction we've had in the past and the near government shutdowns - the government shutdowns and the near default - maybe that means that next year Congress and the White House will be able to get more things done by working together, even though they'll also be having a lot of very messy fights and big veto fights.

MARTIN: You are such an optimistic woman.

LIASSON: (Laughter).

MARTIN: NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Thanks so much, Mara.

LIASSON: Thank you.

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON — President Trump's nomination of Navy Rear Adm. Ronny Jackson to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs is in peril after the Senate delayed his confirmation hearing amid concerns about his record and Trump said he was leaving the decision up to Jackson about whether to continue.

Jackson met with the president in the Oval Office late Tuesday, and two officials said afterward that Jackson didn't want to withdraw and instead wanted to fight it out. But that could change, cautioned the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Senate VA Committee leaders said earlier Tuesday that they had received ""serious allegations"" about Jackson's service as a naval and White House physician.

Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., the highest ranking Democrat on the committee, told NPR and other media outlets they concerned complaints Jackson oversaw a hostile work environment, allowed the improper prescription of drugs and drank on the job.

Approximately 20 people raised concerns to the committee, Tester told CNN's Anderson Cooper, with some alleging that Jackson would hand out prescriptions ""like candy.""

An investigation by the Navy’s Medical Inspector General concluded in 2012 that Jackson and another White House doctor had exhibited “unprofessional behaviors” and suggested the White House consider replacing one or both of them, according to the investigation report. Jackson has served as a White House doctor since 2006.

Trump said he hadn't heard of the ""particular allegations,"" but he called Jackson ""one of the finest people I have met” and ripped senators for questioning his record.

“I told Adm. Jackson just a little while ago, I said, ‘What do you need this for?’ This is a vicious group of people,” the president said. “He’s an admiral, he’s a great leader. And they question him about every little thing.”

Committee Chairman Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., and Tester wrote a letter to Trump Tuesday asking for documentation “regarding allegations or incidents involving Rear Admiral Jackson from 2006 to present.”

“It is our privilege to serve veterans and their families and it is our duty to ensure that the individual who serves as Secretary of Veterans Affairs is qualified, capable, and appropriate for the position,” they wrote.

They postponed the confirmation hearing scheduled for Wednesday. No future hearing date was set. Tester said the earliest the committee could finish its review would probably be in 10 days. Asked if the nomination was salvageable, he said, “We’re still working on the vetting.”

'It's totally his decision'

It's unclear whether the nomination will survive that long. Trump said he was reluctant to subject Jackson to the public gauntlet required to continue, but ""it's totally his decision.""

Jackson is ""not a political person. I don’t want to put a man through a process like this. It’s too ugly and too disgusting,” he said. “The fact is, I wouldn’t do it. What does he need it for? ... I don’t think personally he should do it.”

Trump picked Jackson to take over the VA after he ousted Secretary David Shulkin last month. After the president's physical this year, Jackson lauded Trump’s “excellent” health and “incredibly good genes.”

The White House issued a statement Tuesday evening fighting back against the allegations being reviewed by the Senate and noting that Jackson has received glowing performance evaluations since the 2012 report.

White House officials said a recent controlled substances audit by outside experts determined Jackson worked within the official guidelines and his medicinal prescriptions were appropriate.

Still, Democrats criticized the White House for failing to adequately vet Jackson before forwarding his nomination to the Senate.

Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., speculated that Trump, ""who we know acts on impulse, had this nominee in the room, his doctor, and said, 'Hey, let’s put you up' — without any vetting.”

""How did he get through the process with all of these allegations not even being made public?"" he said.

Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, who sits on the VA committee, said the number of people who came forward with allegations is in the double digits.

""They're people that knew him or know him, have worked with him, in the military or former military that are willing to talk to investigators about him,"" he said. ""So I don't know what's true, but I do know that all kinds of people are coming forward, and that should have given the White House some pause on this nomination.""

Republicans voiced similar concerns. North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis said that if the allegations prove true, “then it’s a vetting miss.”

“Somebody who’s going to run an agency this big with so much responsibility, you want to make sure you’ve vetted properly,"" Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake said. ""I’m not sure that was done here.""

Lack of experience

Until Tuesday, the most serious concerns raised about Jackson's nomination were whether he had enough management experience to lead the troubled VA, which has more than 300,000 employees and operates 1,200 medical facilities across the country.

Jackson, 50, is a native of Levelland, Texas, who attended medical school at the University of Texas and began his active-duty service in the Navy in 1995, according to his biography.

He did stints in Florida, Italy and Virginia before being deployed in 2005 to Iraq, where he was an emergency medical doctor at a trauma unit in Taqaddum. He began work at the White House the following year.

Jackson dismissed concerns about his experience this month in an interview with the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal, saying, “I think I’ve got what it takes.”

Cheri Bustos , the Illinois lawmaker who is charged with ensuring House Democrats hold on to their majority , had some brutally honest words for a 20-something woman asking when Congress might see gender parity .
“ Probably in your lifetime , not mine , ” Bustos , a 57-year-old Congress member in her fourth term , said during a March event . At the gathering , hosted by the Wing in Washington , DC , Bustos spoke at length about the need to recruit more women to the Democratic Party ( she ’ d like to set a new record in the House , building on the 89 who are currently serving ) while recognizing just how many challenges remain .
Most experts agree with Bustos , whose estimate may even be a bit optimistic . According to an analysis by Deutsche Bank Securities chief economist Torsten Slok , at the current rate , the US is about 90 years away from seeing equal numbers of men and women in Congress . It ’ ll happen by 2108 — if we ’ re lucky .
While women had a record year in the 2018 midterm elections , bringing their total numbers in Congress to 127 , much of the data is still grim . For every woman across both chambers , there are roughly three men . And the split along party lines is even starker . Thirty-eight percent of Democratic lawmakers are currently women , while just 8 percent of Republicans are .
By international standards , it ’ s downright embarrassing . America currently ranks 76th of 193 countries in women ’ s representation , according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union . That ranking is actually lower than two decades ago , as other countries have improved on this measure while the US has stagnated .
It doesn ’ t have to be this way . Political experts say there are key reforms that could significantly reduce the country ’ s existing gender disparities — and we know they ’ re effective because other places have already tried them . Some , like a quota system , would be harder to implement , while others , like a shift to ranked-choice voting , have already picked up momentum .
Achieving gender parity in Congress isn ’ t just a matter of international pride or identity politics . A more representative government , as research has repeatedly shown , has real effects on improving the lives of women . A study from Georgetown University professor Michele Swers found that liberal women in Congress sponsored far more bills related to women ’ s health than their male counterparts . Female lawmakers , backed , on average , 10.6 bills related to the subject , roughly double the number supported by their male colleagues .
If America is serious about getting more women into Congress , here ’ s how it could be done .
The quickest way to get to gender parity is to require it .
“ If you could do anything ... and be really transformative , the thing to do would be to adopt a quota policy , ” says Diana O ’ Brien , a political science professor at Texas A & M University who focuses on the intersection of gender and politics .
Quotas are now used in some capacity by half the countries in the world — including in many of those that currently rank above the US when it comes to gender parity . In places that have imposed a quota , like Tanzania and Rwanda , anywhere from 20 to 50 percent of representatives in the country ’ s federal legislature are legally required to be women . It ’ s a mandate that works .
While not all quotas have been equally effective ( and some stop short of increasing women ’ s actual influence over policy ) , a 2018 paper in the Journal of Politics found that quota systems , on average , contributed to the doubling of women ’ s representation in federal legislatures from 10 percent to 20 percent . In places that had implemented quotas — and saw more women take office as a result — there was also a notable increase in funding and focus directed toward public health . For every 1 percent increase in women in the legislature , researchers found a 0.06 percent increase in spending on health care , and in some places , a commensurate decline in spending on defense .
Quotas often take the form of either an amendment to a country ’ s constitution or the passage of a new law . In Rwanda , a 2003 amendment to the country ’ s constitution reserved 30 percent of the seats in its legislature for women . Today , 64 percent of its parliament is made up of women , up from 18 percent in the 1990s . In Belgium , a 2002 law required political parties to run a certain number of women on the ballot . Since the implementation of its quota laws , women ’ s representation in its parliament has grown from 16 percent to 40 percent .
The prime place to enact this could be in the Senate , O ’ Brien told ███ . An amendment to the Constitution or new legislation could mandate that every state elect at least one female senator , for example . The House is slightly more challenging since districts only have one representative , but half the seats in the lower chamber could also be effectively “ reserved ” for women .
Actually imposing a quota of this kind would likely be tough , and face significant legal opposition . According to a paper from the William & Mary Law Review , it ’ s unclear if Congress , which has regulatory oversight of federal elections , has the legal authority to pass a law establishing a quota system .
Plus , if lawmakers wanted to go the constitutional amendment route , they would need the approval of two-thirds of both the House and the Senate , as well as three-quarters of states , a long shot for something that ’ s expected to be quite controversial .
Quotas , after all , have also been criticized for being anti-democratic , and anti-meritocratic . Those who push back on such claims argue that the existing underrepresentation of a large swath of the population is anti-democratic in itself . They also point to a study of Swedish quotas that found that the implementation of gender quotas saw more qualified women take office and actually improved the quality of the male politicians .
Parties could voluntarily implement a version of the quota system as well . Who wins a primary is often up to voters , rather than party leaders , but they could self-impose recruiting requirements , making sure there are women competing in each viable primary .
However , it would require both parties to be on board for it to really work . The lopsided commitment to gender parity from Democrats and Republicans in the US is , ultimately , a major reason progress has been so sluggish . While emerging leaders in the Republican Party , like Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York ’ s 21st District , have made recruiting more women a priority , the GOP as a whole has been less focused on this goal compared to Democrats , due to its aversion to anything tied to so-called identity politics .
“ Republicans are far less likely to believe in group rights or identity politics , ” says Jennifer Lawless , a political science professor at the University of Virginia . “ Structurally , the biggest challenge that needs to be met is to provide incentives to the Republican Party . ”
One of the biggest incentives to Republicans , Lawless notes , is the risk the party faces in losing independent women , a major voter demographic . In moderate districts and purple states , the hemorrhaging of such voters could prompt Republicans to place more focus on gender equity .
A second reform would address one of the biggest challenges that many candidates face when running for office : raising money .
Political action committees , or organizations that use funds to advance different campaigns , have historically poured a ton of money into elections . In 2018 alone , the top PACs spent more than $ 50 million on the midterm elections , according to the Center for Responsive Politics . They ’ ve also historically underfunded women , especially on the Republican side .
There ’ s one idea that ’ s been raised to simultaneously dilute the influence of these PACs and promote underrepresented candidates : expanding public financing .
Public financing simply means an increase in funding for political candidates offered by the government . In order to receive this government support , candidates often have to commit to limits on their campaign spending and caps on the types of donations they receive .
Public financing can take a few different forms . There are block grant programs , in which the government provides all the funding a candidate needs for a particular race . There are matching programs , in which candidates agree to accept small-dollar donations , and the government will match the funds they raise . And there are voucher programs , in which the government gives the public what ’ s effectively “ free money ” to donate to the candidate of their choice .
Although the research about the effects of public financing programs is ongoing , there is early evidence to suggest that it allows a wider range of voters to contribute to a campaign , and ultimately elect a more diverse slate of lawmakers who don ’ t need to rely on PACs for money .
New York City , where the government will match candidate donations sixfold ( up to every $ 175 donation ) , for example , has seen strong results , according to the Campaign Legal Center :
Since New York City first enacted public financing , city voters have elected the first African-American mayor , and the first Asian-American , Dominican-American , and African-American woman to city council . For the first time in thirty years , a third-party candidate won a seat on city council .
According to a report from the Center for American Progress , multiple states that have robust public financing programs including Arizona , Minnesota , and Maine also have a higher proportion of women in their state legislatures . Public financing can convince more candidates to run , since it guarantees a degree of financial support . Additionally , it means that candidates are less reliant on big-money donors .
Building up more public financing systems likely won ’ t be enough , for now . While a public financing option for presidential elections currently exists , there is none at the federal level for congressional races . Multiple bills , including the Fair Elections Now Act , have been raised , though they have yet to become law . And even if this support were to exist , candidates in particularly competitive races may opt out of this option , because it would force them to limit the number of private donations they could receive , in addition to their total spending .
A more immediate lever , then , could be to ramp up pressure on PACs and private donors and push them to give to women .
Emily ’ s List has provided one of the most effective models of this approach for Democrats , while Winning for Women , a GOP PAC , says it ’ s laser-focused on doing the same for Republican women in 2020 . “ Twenty in 20 . We want to see the number of [ Republican ] women in total in the House back up to 20 , ” Olivia Perez-Cubas , a spokesperson for Winning for Women , told ███ . ( Republicans had 23 women in the House during the previous congressional term , though they ’ ve since seen their ranks drop to 13 . )
A third reform that could play a major role in propelling more women into office is already being implemented in a handful of local and state elections , in places like Maine and San Francisco : ranked-choice voting .
This idea enables people to rank a slate of candidates from their top choice to their least favorite — rather than selecting just one candidate , as Americans do now .
If ranked-choice voting were implemented in the Democratic primary , for example , instead of picking a single candidate , voters would be able to rank a set of them . A voter who preferred Sen. Elizabeth Warren could still rank Sen. Kamala Harris second and Sen. Bernie Sanders third .
When the votes are tallied , if no candidate has accrued more than 50 percent of the vote , the candidate who has the fewest first-choice votes is removed . Those votes then go to each voter ’ s second choice . This process is repeated until one candidate secures a majority of the vote .
As Lee Drutman writes for ███ , ranked choice has been adopted by 20 cities and was first used by Maine for its statewide and federal elections in 2018 .
Voting this way means that voters will typically be nudged into getting to know more candidates , and candidates , too , will be pushed into campaigning across broader constituencies . Because of how it ’ s set up , ranked choice can have positive effects on diversifying representation , it turns out .
These elections often wind up being less negative , which can spur more women to run . Additionally , since voters get to choose among a broad set of candidates , they don ’ t have to worry about “ the electability question ” or splitting the vote , a feature that could make them more likely to weigh traditionally underrepresented candidates .
“ In the cities where you see ranked-choice voting , there ’ s double the women on the city councils .

Cheri Bustos, the Illinois lawmaker who is charged with ensuring House Democrats hold on to their majority, had some brutally honest words for a 20-something woman asking when Congress might see gender parity.

“Probably in your lifetime, not mine,” Bustos, a 57-year-old Congress member in her fourth term, said during a March event. At the gathering, hosted by the Wing in Washington, DC, Bustos spoke at length about the need to recruit more women to the Democratic Party (she’d like to set a new record in the House, building on the 89 who are currently serving) while recognizing just how many challenges remain.

Most experts agree with Bustos, whose estimate may even be a bit optimistic. According to an analysis by Deutsche Bank Securities chief economist Torsten Slok, at the current rate, the US is about 90 years away from seeing equal numbers of men and women in Congress. It’ll happen by 2108 — if we’re lucky.

While women had a record year in the 2018 midterm elections, bringing their total numbers in Congress to 127, much of the data is still grim. For every woman across both chambers, there are roughly three men. And the split along party lines is even starker. Thirty-eight percent of Democratic lawmakers are currently women, while just 8 percent of Republicans are.

By international standards, it’s downright embarrassing. America currently ranks 76th of 193 countries in women’s representation, according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union. That ranking is actually lower than two decades ago, as other countries have improved on this measure while the US has stagnated.

It doesn’t have to be this way. Political experts say there are key reforms that could significantly reduce the country’s existing gender disparities — and we know they’re effective because other places have already tried them. Some, like a quota system, would be harder to implement, while others, like a shift to ranked-choice voting, have already picked up momentum.

Achieving gender parity in Congress isn’t just a matter of international pride or identity politics. A more representative government, as research has repeatedly shown, has real effects on improving the lives of women. A study from Georgetown University professor Michele Swers found that liberal women in Congress sponsored far more bills related to women’s health than their male counterparts. Female lawmakers, backed, on average, 10.6 bills related to the subject, roughly double the number supported by their male colleagues.

If America is serious about getting more women into Congress, here’s how it could be done.

Use a quota system

The quickest way to get to gender parity is to require it.

“If you could do anything ... and be really transformative, the thing to do would be to adopt a quota policy,” says Diana O’Brien, a political science professor at Texas A&M University who focuses on the intersection of gender and politics.

Quotas are now used in some capacity by half the countries in the world — including in many of those that currently rank above the US when it comes to gender parity. In places that have imposed a quota, like Tanzania and Rwanda, anywhere from 20 to 50 percent of representatives in the country’s federal legislature are legally required to be women. It’s a mandate that works.

While not all quotas have been equally effective (and some stop short of increasing women’s actual influence over policy), a 2018 paper in the Journal of Politics found that quota systems, on average, contributed to the doubling of women’s representation in federal legislatures from 10 percent to 20 percent. In places that had implemented quotas — and saw more women take office as a result — there was also a notable increase in funding and focus directed toward public health. For every 1 percent increase in women in the legislature, researchers found a 0.06 percent increase in spending on health care, and in some places, a commensurate decline in spending on defense.

Quotas often take the form of either an amendment to a country’s constitution or the passage of a new law. In Rwanda, a 2003 amendment to the country’s constitution reserved 30 percent of the seats in its legislature for women. Today, 64 percent of its parliament is made up of women, up from 18 percent in the 1990s. In Belgium, a 2002 law required political parties to run a certain number of women on the ballot. Since the implementation of its quota laws, women’s representation in its parliament has grown from 16 percent to 40 percent.

The prime place to enact this could be in the Senate, O’Brien told Vox. An amendment to the Constitution or new legislation could mandate that every state elect at least one female senator, for example. The House is slightly more challenging since districts only have one representative, but half the seats in the lower chamber could also be effectively “reserved” for women.

Actually imposing a quota of this kind would likely be tough, and face significant legal opposition. According to a paper from the William & Mary Law Review, it’s unclear if Congress, which has regulatory oversight of federal elections, has the legal authority to pass a law establishing a quota system.

Plus, if lawmakers wanted to go the constitutional amendment route, they would need the approval of two-thirds of both the House and the Senate, as well as three-quarters of states, a long shot for something that’s expected to be quite controversial.

Quotas, after all, have also been criticized for being anti-democratic, and anti-meritocratic. Those who push back on such claims argue that the existing underrepresentation of a large swath of the population is anti-democratic in itself. They also point to a study of Swedish quotas that found that the implementation of gender quotas saw more qualified women take office and actually improved the quality of the male politicians.

Parties could voluntarily implement a version of the quota system as well. Who wins a primary is often up to voters, rather than party leaders, but they could self-impose recruiting requirements, making sure there are women competing in each viable primary.

However, it would require both parties to be on board for it to really work. The lopsided commitment to gender parity from Democrats and Republicans in the US is, ultimately, a major reason progress has been so sluggish. While emerging leaders in the Republican Party, like Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York’s 21st District, have made recruiting more women a priority, the GOP as a whole has been less focused on this goal compared to Democrats, due to its aversion to anything tied to so-called identity politics.

“Republicans are far less likely to believe in group rights or identity politics,” says Jennifer Lawless, a political science professor at the University of Virginia. “Structurally, the biggest challenge that needs to be met is to provide incentives to the Republican Party.”

One of the biggest incentives to Republicans, Lawless notes, is the risk the party faces in losing independent women, a major voter demographic. In moderate districts and purple states, the hemorrhaging of such voters could prompt Republicans to place more focus on gender equity.

Increase public financing for campaigns

A second reform would address one of the biggest challenges that many candidates face when running for office: raising money.

Political action committees, or organizations that use funds to advance different campaigns, have historically poured a ton of money into elections. In 2018 alone, the top PACs spent more than $50 million on the midterm elections, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. They’ve also historically underfunded women, especially on the Republican side.

There’s one idea that’s been raised to simultaneously dilute the influence of these PACs and promote underrepresented candidates: expanding public financing.

Public financing simply means an increase in funding for political candidates offered by the government. In order to receive this government support, candidates often have to commit to limits on their campaign spending and caps on the types of donations they receive.

Public financing can take a few different forms. There are block grant programs, in which the government provides all the funding a candidate needs for a particular race. There are matching programs, in which candidates agree to accept small-dollar donations, and the government will match the funds they raise. And there are voucher programs, in which the government gives the public what’s effectively “free money” to donate to the candidate of their choice.

Although the research about the effects of public financing programs is ongoing, there is early evidence to suggest that it allows a wider range of voters to contribute to a campaign, and ultimately elect a more diverse slate of lawmakers who don’t need to rely on PACs for money.

New York City, where the government will match candidate donations sixfold (up to every $175 donation), for example, has seen strong results, according to the Campaign Legal Center:

Since New York City first enacted public financing, city voters have elected the first African-American mayor, and the first Asian-American, Dominican-American, and African-American woman to city council. For the first time in thirty years, a third-party candidate won a seat on city council.

According to a report from the Center for American Progress, multiple states that have robust public financing programs including Arizona, Minnesota, and Maine also have a higher proportion of women in their state legislatures. Public financing can convince more candidates to run, since it guarantees a degree of financial support. Additionally, it means that candidates are less reliant on big-money donors.

Building up more public financing systems likely won’t be enough, for now. While a public financing option for presidential elections currently exists, there is none at the federal level for congressional races. Multiple bills, including the Fair Elections Now Act, have been raised, though they have yet to become law. And even if this support were to exist, candidates in particularly competitive races may opt out of this option, because it would force them to limit the number of private donations they could receive, in addition to their total spending.

A more immediate lever, then, could be to ramp up pressure on PACs and private donors and push them to give to women.

Emily’s List has provided one of the most effective models of this approach for Democrats, while Winning for Women, a GOP PAC, says it’s laser-focused on doing the same for Republican women in 2020. “Twenty in 20. We want to see the number of [Republican] women in total in the House back up to 20,” Olivia Perez-Cubas, a spokesperson for Winning for Women, told Vox. (Republicans had 23 women in the House during the previous congressional term, though they’ve since seen their ranks drop to 13.)

Change the way we vote

A third reform that could play a major role in propelling more women into office is already being implemented in a handful of local and state elections, in places like Maine and San Francisco: ranked-choice voting.

This idea enables people to rank a slate of candidates from their top choice to their least favorite — rather than selecting just one candidate, as Americans do now.

If ranked-choice voting were implemented in the Democratic primary, for example, instead of picking a single candidate, voters would be able to rank a set of them. A voter who preferred Sen. Elizabeth Warren could still rank Sen. Kamala Harris second and Sen. Bernie Sanders third.

When the votes are tallied, if no candidate has accrued more than 50 percent of the vote, the candidate who has the fewest first-choice votes is removed. Those votes then go to each voter’s second choice. This process is repeated until one candidate secures a majority of the vote.

As Lee Drutman writes for Vox, ranked choice has been adopted by 20 cities and was first used by Maine for its statewide and federal elections in 2018.

Voting this way means that voters will typically be nudged into getting to know more candidates, and candidates, too, will be pushed into campaigning across broader constituencies. Because of how it’s set up, ranked choice can have positive effects on diversifying representation, it turns out.

These elections often wind up being less negative, which can spur more women to run. Additionally, since voters get to choose among a broad set of candidates, they don’t have to worry about “the electability question” or splitting the vote, a feature that could make them more likely to weigh traditionally underrepresented candidates.

“In the cities where you see ranked-choice voting, there’s double the women on the city councils. There’s 40 percent more women mayors; it also adds more people of color,” says Erin Vilardi, the founder of VoteRunLead, an organization focused on recruiting women to pursue office. It’s worth noting that many cities that have implemented this practice are also progressive hubs that have historically boosted women candidates more than other places.

“The data is so clear and it’s unimpeachable. More diverse women are going to get elected, and it’s going to pick up steam,” argues Cynthia Terrell, the founder of RepresentWomen.

Ranked-choice voting also has relatively low barriers to implementation. In Maine, it was approved via a ballot measure by its residents in 2016 and was first used last year — demonstrating how quickly cities, and even states, can begin making changes that help improve their elected representation.

Ultimately, achieving gender parity in Congress is only seen as a slog because it’s being treated like one. Practically speaking, if both parties and the American public had the political will, it could happen in the next decade.

“In order to bring about gender parity in Congress, we’re talking about identifying another 100 women who can win elections,” Lawless emphasizes. “In 2020 or 2022, we should be able to do this at the congressional level.”",www.vox.com,left,SO8LMkHcq6ptYNWB

Democrats and Republicans are headed for a showdown Thursday that will blow away what little chances are left of bipartisanship cooperation in the Senate and ideological moderation on the Supreme Court.

Both sides will walk away pleased with their destructive handiwork, but only for a while. Their sense of satisfaction is destined to be fleeting.

Like children bent on immediate gratification, Senate Democrats, holding just 48 votes, planned to use the filibuster in a bid to stop the confirmation of President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch. The move, if successful, would require Gorsuch to get 60 votes, instead of a simple majority, for confirmation.

As everyone knows, it won't be successful. Republicans will retaliate by changing Senate rules, using the ""nuclear option,"" to eliminate the filibuster in Supreme Court confirmation battles. And Gorsuch will end up being seated.

All of this might sound like procedural minutiae, but it will greatly affect the future of the Senate, the Supreme Court and the nation.

End the filibuster farce: Opposing view

Despite their loss, the Democrats will have shown their liberal base that they stood up to Trump, fought the good fight, and tried to retaliate for the shameless obstruction that Senate Republicans used last year to thwart President Obama’s highly qualified nominee, Merrick Garland, for the vacancy left by the death of conservative icon Antonin Scalia.

Meanwhile, Republicans will glory in one simple fact: They won. They demonstrated that they’d do whatever was needed to seat a judge at least as conservative as Scalia.

In the long run, however, both sides will undoubtedly come to regret their impetuous and destructive actions.

Democrats weren't going to win this fight. Gorsuch has sterling credentials and a top rating from the American Bar Association. Opponents barely laid a glove on him during four days of confirmation hearings. Nor is Gorsuch going to change the ideological balance on the high court.

But there will be a next time, and maybe not that far in the future. Leading liberal Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer are 84 and 78, respectively. Pivotal swing vote Justice Anthony Kennedy is 80. A Trump nominee to replace any of them could alter the ideological balance on the court for decades, affecting everything from voting rights to the right to choose abortion. Any leverage a filibuster might have given the Democrats will have been squandered in a no-win battle.

And the Republicans, who will one day be back in the minority, perhaps sooner than they think, will have lost a key tool for thwarting people they oppose.

As for who’s at fault for reaching this moment, neither party is blameless. Senate Democrats abused the filibuster during George W. Bush’s administration to thwart his judicial nominees. Then, in 2013, Republicans stood in the way of three superbly qualified Obama nominees to the federal appeals court in Washington, considered the second most important in the nation. Frustrated Democrats foolishly used the “nuclear option” to eliminate the filibuster for lower-court nominees, and Republicans warned darkly how dangerous that was.

Now the parties have switched tactics and scripts, sounding equally hypocritical. If each side could somehow pull back from the brink, they and the nation would be better off.

Without a 60-vote standard, nominees to the federal courts will be even more extreme, further to the left or the right, depending which party is in power. Public confidence in the Senate will continue to erode, along with the trust that justices are fair and impartial arbiters of the law.

Lindsey Graham Lindsey Olin GrahamGOP senators balk at lengthy impeachment trial Graham: Senate trial 'must expose the whistleblower' Graham says Schiff should be a witness in Trump impeachment trial MORE (R-S.C.), McCain’s best friend in the Senate, did not call out Trump over his disparaging remarks about McCain over the weekend, though he defended his friend. Graham is up for reelection in 2020.

“He stepped forward to risk his life for his country, served honorably under difficult circumstances, and was one of the most consequential senators in the history of the body. Nothing about his service will ever be changed or diminished,” Graham tweeted Sunday.

He did later call Trump’s criticism of McCain “a huge mistake.”

Most of the criticism of Trump has come from people like Flake who are former GOP senators — though their remarks, like Isakson’s, are said to reflect the feelings of other senators.

Former Sen. Judd Gregg (R-N.H.), who served 18 years in the Senate with McCain and was an adviser to McConnell’s leadership team, said “it’s almost an attack on Sen. McCain and his incredible record of service to the United States but it’s an attack on the Senate and I think that’s the way most senators probably view it.”

He questioned whether the tensions could lead to problems for Trump with the Senate, however.

“I don’t know where it goes. His relationships with the Congress are so weak now that I don’t think he can hurt it anymore,” he said.

Richard Russell Jr. (D-Ga.), a longtime opponent of civil rights legislation, after McCain instead.

Isakson, however, dismissed the effort as “playing politics” and said he would wait for recommendations from a committee, including members of McCain’s family, on how to best honor his former colleague.

“I can’t understand why the President would, once again, disparage a man as exemplary as my friend John McCain: heroic, courageous, patriotic, honorable, self-effacing, self-sacrificing, empathetic, and driven by duty to family, country, and God,” Romney tweeted on Tuesday.

Other Republicans have shied away from challenging Trump, notably Sen. Martha McSally Martha Elizabeth McSallyThis week: House kicks off public phase of impeachment inquiry Progressive veterans group launches campaign labeling Trump as a 'national security threat' Advocates step up efforts for horse racing reform bill after more deaths MORE (R-Ariz.), who was appointed to fill McCain’s vacant seat in December and faces a tough reelection next year.

McSally praised McCain Wednesday as “an American hero,” tweeting “everyone should give him and his family the respect, admiration, and peace they deserve.”

That response, however, drew criticism from EJ Montini, an opinion columnist for The Arizona Republic, who said it didn’t go far enough.

“She’s afraid. She has an election coming up in 2020, and she’s afraid that if she speaks honestly about Trump, he’ll turn on her,” he wrote.",www.thehill.com,center,60Zt3lRyGTLG1Cfo

Major hurdles remain, but the lopsided 90-8 procedural vote was a boost for proponents hoping to win Senate passage this month. And the House Agriculture Committee is moving up its own markup to the week of June 18 in anticipation of House floor debate in July.

The promised savings — $23.6 billion over 10 years — are significantly less than President Barack Obama and House Republicans have demanded in their budget alternatives. But the bill still represents a real down payment, and given the importance of farm exports to the faltering U.S. economy, both parties have reason to avoid a major confrontation that will slow progress in Congress.

This was very much the tone of the formal statement on administration policy issued after the Senate vote. Coming off the sidelines, the White House said it “looks forward to working with the Congress to achieve crop insurance and commodity program savings that are not contained” in the Senate bill. But the statement carefully avoids any veto threat, and instead congratulates senators for making “meaningful progress” toward the president’s goals.

Vilsack, a former Iowa governor, has worked himself behind the scenes to provide technical advice while staying away from the past practice of having his department write its own alternative farm bill.

In a short interview, he cited specific concerns about the level of nutrition spending cuts being discussed by House Republicans and proposed Senate changes affecting agricultural research.

Ted Cruz .
The timing is no coincidence . Mr. Cruz ’ s hearing comes as the latest in a series of moves making it clear to the international community that the Republican-controlled Congress isn ’ t on board with President Obama ’ s effort to cement his legacy with a deal at the Paris climate conference .
The rising Republican drumbeat may have already prompted the European Union to back off of its earlier insistence that any carbon pollution goals in the final agreement need to be legally binding , according to The Associated Press .
“ We need the United States on board , and we have to find a solution , ” EU Climate Commissioner Miguel Arias Canete told reporters on the sidelines of the conference . “ We understand the concerns they have because of the political situation they have in the Congress . ”
No sooner had the talks begun than the House and Senate sent a shot over the bow by passing joint resolutions against the EPA ’ s Clean Power Plan , the cornerstone of the White House ’ s plan to drive down greenhouse gas emissions . The rule has also been challenged in court by 25 states .
A State Department envoy told reporters that the vote would have no impact on the talks , hosted by the United Nations Environment Program and also known as COP21 , pointing out that Mr. Obama plans to veto the resolutions . Still , the tone was set .
“ The message could not be more clear that Republicans and Democrats in both the U.S. Senate and U.S. House do not support the president ’ s climate agenda , and the international community should take note , ” said Sen. James M. Inhofe , chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works , in a statement after the vote .
While Senate Republicans have insisted that any legally binding treaty must be ratified , Mr. Obama has been cagier , saying in Paris that the “ process ” and “ procedures ” must be legally binding but that the “ targets themselves may not have the force of treaties . ”
Mr. Obama has pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent below 2005 levels over the next decade and by 80 percent by 2050 , goals that Republicans lambasted during a Dec. 1 hearing by the House Committee on Science , Space and Technology hearing .
“ The U.S. pledge to the U.N. is estimated to prevent only one-fiftieth of one degree Celsius temperature rise over the next 85 years ! Incredible ! ” said Committee Chairman Lamar Smith in a statement afterward . “ This would be laughable if it weren ’ t for the tremendous costs it imposes on the American people . ”
The same day , the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works released a “ white paper ” by the majority staff on the talks , known as COP21 , called “ Forecast for COP21 : Senate Predicts Obama ’ s Climate Promises Come Up Short Again . ”
Mr. Inhofe accompanied the release of the paper with a statement saying the president ’ s target for emission reductions “ doesn ’ t even add up to what it claims , and will not add up to achieve any measurable impact on curbing global temperatures or curtailing global warming . ”
Democrats soon rallied : Ten Senate Democrats and former Vice President Al Gore held a press conference Saturday in Paris to counter the current of Republican opposition and show support for Mr. Obama .
“ U.S . leadership has played a critical role in bringing us to this time in history and we will not walk away from this global opportunity , ” said Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin , Maryland Democrat and ranking Democrat on the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations , in a statement .
Environmentalists lambasted Republicans for acting counter to the spirit of the talks , such as with Thursday ’ s House vote to lift the oil export ban .
“ While world leaders seek to forge an international agreement to slow global warming , the last thing Congress should do is try to speed it up by lifting our oil export ban , ” said Margie Alt , executive director of Environment America , in a statement .
While climate change groups have descended en masse on Paris , so have free market advocates who argue that climate change doomsday forecasts are unfounded and that reducing greenhouse gases will result in higher electricity costs and more poverty .
The free market Heartland Institute held Monday its “ Day of Examining the Data ” conference in Paris , featuring a video keynote address from Mr. Inhofe and panels with leading scientists skeptical of the global warming movement ’ s narrative .
The event also featured the “ world premiere ” of the film “ Climate Hustle ” by CFACT and Climate Depot ’ s Marc Morano .
“ The film features scientists who used to be believers in the man-made global warming narrative and have now grown skeptical , ” Mr. Morano last week told Fox News ’ Sean Hannity .
The topic of Mr. Cruz ’ s subcommittee hearing is “ Data or Dogma ? Promoting Open Inquiry in the Debate Over the Magnitude of Human Impact on Earth ’ s Climate . ”
Among the speakers are John Christy , professor at the University of Alabama at Huntsville , Judith Curry , professor at Georgia Institute of Technology , and Princeton professor William Happer .","As Obama administration officials confer Tuesday at the climate talks in Paris, a who’s who of top climate change doubters will be testifying before a Senate subcommittee at a hearing convened by Texas Sen.

No sooner had the talks begun than the House and Senate sent a shot over the bow by passing joint resolutions against the EPA’s Clean Power Plan, the cornerstone of the White House’s plan to drive down greenhouse gas emissions. The rule has also been challenged in court by 25 states.

A State Department envoy told reporters that the vote would have no impact on the talks, hosted by the United Nations Environment Program and also known as COP21, pointing out that Mr. Obama plans to veto the resolutions. Still, the tone was set.

“The message could not be more clear that Republicans and Democrats in both the U.S. Senate and U.S. House do not support the president’s climate agenda, and the international community should take note,” said Sen. James M. Inhofe, chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, in a statement after the vote.

While Senate Republicans have insisted that any legally binding treaty must be ratified, Mr. Obama has been cagier, saying in Paris that the “process” and “procedures” must be legally binding but that the “targets themselves may not have the force of treaties.”

Mr. Obama has pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent below 2005 levels over the next decade and by 80 percent by 2050, goals that Republicans lambasted during a Dec. 1 hearing by the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology hearing.

“The U.S. pledge to the U.N. is estimated to prevent only one-fiftieth of one degree Celsius temperature rise over the next 85 years! Incredible!” said Committee Chairman Lamar Smith in a statement afterward. “This would be laughable if it weren’t for the tremendous costs it imposes on the American people.”

The same day, the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works released a “white paper” by the majority staff on the talks, known as COP21, called “Forecast for COP21: Senate Predicts Obama’s Climate Promises Come Up Short Again.”

Mr. Inhofe accompanied the release of the paper with a statement saying the president’s target for emission reductions “doesn’t even add up to what it claims, and will not add up to achieve any measurable impact on curbing global temperatures or curtailing global warming.”

Democrats soon rallied: Ten Senate Democrats and former Vice President Al Gore held a press conference Saturday in Paris to counter the current of Republican opposition and show support for Mr. Obama.

“U.S. leadership has played a critical role in bringing us to this time in history and we will not walk away from this global opportunity,” said Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin, Maryland Democrat and ranking Democrat on the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, in a statement.

Environmentalists lambasted Republicans for acting counter to the spirit of the talks, such as with Thursday’s House vote to lift the oil export ban.

“While world leaders seek to forge an international agreement to slow global warming, the last thing Congress should do is try to speed it up by lifting our oil export ban,” said Margie Alt, executive director of Environment America, in a statement.

While climate change groups have descended en masse on Paris, so have free market advocates who argue that climate change doomsday forecasts are unfounded and that reducing greenhouse gases will result in higher electricity costs and more poverty.

The free market Heartland Institute held Monday its “Day of Examining the Data” conference in Paris, featuring a video keynote address from Mr. Inhofe and panels with leading scientists skeptical of the global warming movement’s narrative.

The event also featured the “world premiere” of the film “Climate Hustle” by CFACT and Climate Depot’s Marc Morano.

“The film features scientists who used to be believers in the man-made global warming narrative and have now grown skeptical,” Mr. Morano last week told Fox News’ Sean Hannity.

The topic of Mr. Cruz’s subcommittee hearing is “Data or Dogma? Promoting Open Inquiry in the Debate Over the Magnitude of Human Impact on Earth’s Climate.”

Among the speakers are John Christy, professor at the University of Alabama at Huntsville, Judith Curry, professor at Georgia Institute of Technology, and Princeton professor William Happer.

The roughly 700,000 young people were brought to the United States illegally as children, mainly from Mexico and Central America. They mostly grew up in the United States.

Former President Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program gave the Dreamers legal protections and shielded them from deportation.

Democrats, as a condition of supporting a new spending stopgap, demanded a resolution of the uncertain future Trump created for the Dreamers with his DACA order last year.

But Democratic leaders, worried about being blamed for the disruptive shutdown that resulted, relented in the end and accepted a pledge by Republicans to hold a debate later over the fate of the Dreamers and related immigration issues.

Tens of thousands of federal workers had begun closing down operations for lack of funding on Monday, the first weekday since the shutdown, but essential services such as security and defense operations had continued.

The shutdown undercut Trump’s self-crafted image as a dealmaker who would repair the broken culture in Washington. It forced him to cancel a weekend trip to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.

The U.S. government cannot fully operate without funding bills that are voted in Congress regularly. Washington has been hampered by frequent threats of a shutdown in recent years as the two parties fight over spending, immigration and other issues. The last U.S. government shutdown was in 2013.

Both sides in Washington had tried to blame each other for the shutdown. The White House on Saturday refused to negotiate on immigration issues until the government reopened.

On Monday, Trump met separately at the White House with Republican senators who have taken a harder line on immigration and with moderate Democratic Senators Joe Manchin and Doug Jones.

Reuters/Ipsos polling data released on Monday showed Americans deeply conflicted about the immigration issue, although majorities in both parties supported the DACA program.

‘WHY DO WE HAVE TO WAIT?’

Some liberal groups were infuriated by the decision to reopen the government.

“Today’s cave by Senate Democrats - led by weak-kneed, right-of-center Democrats - is why people don’t believe the Democratic Party stands for anything,” said Stephanie Taylor, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee.

Markets have absorbed the shutdown drama over the past week.

U.S. stocks advanced on Monday as each of Wall Street’s main indexes touched a record intraday level after the shutdown deal.

For Jovan Rodriguez of Brooklyn, New York, a Dreamer whose family came from Mexico when he was 3 years old and ultimately settled in Texas, the latest development was more of the same.

“Why do we have to wait - again? It’s like our lives are suspended in limbo,” he said. And they have been for months. I don’t trust the Republicans and I don’t trust (Senate Majority Leader Mitch) McConnell with just a promise. That’s not good enough any more.”",www.reuters.com,center,wYhDIA7zVej42wFH

Washington (CNN) - Saying that ""No one should be able to pump unlimited funds into political campaigns, whether they are Democrat, Republican or independent,"" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Thursday strongly backed a proposed constitutional amendment that would limit campaign spending by outside groups.

Reid announced on the Senate floor that the Judiciary Committee would soon hold a hearing on the amendment, introduced earlier this year by Democratic Sens. Tom Udall of New Mexico and Michael Bennet of Colorado, and that the full ""Senate will vote on that legislation.""

The measure would curb unlimited campaign spending by giving Congress the authority to regulate raising and spending limits for federal elections.

""Sens. Udall and Bennet's amendment reins in the massive spending of super PACs which have grown so much since the Citizens United decision,"" Reid added.

That's the 2010 Supreme Court ruling that removed legal barriers preventing corporations and unions from spending unlimited sums on federal elections.

The amendment should likely pass the Judiciary Committee, where it only needs a simple majority to advance. But its chances of passing the full Senate, where it needs a two-thirds majority, are extremely slim, due to broad GOP opposition.

As he has numerous times the past few months, Reid targeted much of his firepower against the billionaire industrialists David and Charles Koch, who have spent hundreds of millions since 2010, through the conservative non-profit political advocacy group Americans for Prosperity and other organizations, to attack Democrats and support Republicans. Overall, pro-GOP outside groups have heavily outspent their pro-Democratic rivals since the 2010 Supreme Court ruling opened the floodgates.

""There is absolutely no question the Koch brothers are in a category of their own, in both degree and kind. No one else pumping money into the shadowy campaign organizations and campaigns like they are. There isn't even a close second,"" Reid said. ""They are doing this to promote issues that make themselves even richer.""

""Why not level the playing field for everyone. Let's get this money out of our political system. Let's undo the damage done by the citizens united decision. Let's do it now,"" the Democrat from Nevada added.

Republicans were quick to fire back at Reid's move.

""Today's proposal by the Senate Majority Leader represents an all-out assault on the right to free speech, a right which undergirds all others in our democracy. It's also a clear sign of just how desperate elected Washington Democrats have become in their quest to hold onto power,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement.

""Proposing to take away this fundamental right from the American people and vest it in the federal government instead is the ultimate act of radicalism, and it should concern all Americans who care about their right to speak their minds and to participate freely in the political process,"" added the five-term senator from Kentucky who faces a tough-election of his own this year.

Reid's comments on Capitol Hill came at the same time that American Bridge, a pro-Democratic outside group that concentrates on opposition research against Republicans and defends Democrats, announced a new research and rapid-response project aimed at the Koch brothers.

While Democrats point to the Koch brothers as the poster boys for what they term out-of-control outside spending, Republicans point to Tom Steyer, the wealthy hedge fund manager, philanthropist, and environmentalist, who has bankrolled many Democratic outside efforts.

At play is control of the Senate. The Democrats hold a 55-45 majority in the chamber (including two independents who caucus with the party). But the party's defending 21 of the 36 seats in play in this November's midterm elections, with half of those Democratic-held seats in red or purple states.

Americans for Prosperity has already spent around 25 million to attack Democrats and support Republicans in key Senate races so far this cycle. The biggest pro-Democratic spending outside group, Senate Majority PAC, has shelled out $11.1 million.

While the constitutional amendment faces all-but-certain defeat on the Senate floor, Democrats believe public opinion is on their side, and that the efforts to push the amendment could motivate their base, which is crucial in traditionally low-turnout midterm contests.

Reid first signaled his support of the Udall-Bennet amendment in a BuzzFeed report Wednesday.

The issue of campaign spending was also in the Supreme Court's spotlight earlier this spring. A 5-4 ruling last month by the justices eliminated limits on how much money individuals can donate in total in one election season.

However, the decision left intact the current $5,200 limit on how much an individual can give to any single candidate during a two-year election cycle. Until now, an individual donor could give up to $123,200 per cycle.

us_senate,Politico,0,http://www.politico.com/story/2015/02/mitch-mcconnell-senate-114818.html?hp=t1_r,Mitch McConnell’s way,2015-02-02,Manu Raju,"At a closed-door lunch late last month , one Republican senator after another questioned how their party will escape its political jam on immigration . But the most important man in the room wasn ’ t offering many answers .
The GOP-led House had just created a quandary with no easy way out — passing a $ 39.7 billion Department of Homeland Security spending bill loaded with riders on immigration policy that stand no chance of clearing a Democratic filibuster in the Senate . And with funding set to run out at the end of February , some GOP senators were in no mood to play endless games with the House .
“ We just need to rip the Band-Aid off , ” said one Republican senator , saying the Senate should strip out all the immigration language and pass a “ clean ” DHS funding bill . “ I think the House guys rolled a grenade in the room , ” a second GOP senator said later .
In the middle of it all , showing little emotion as usual , was the person who holds the key to the most important questions facing the Senate these days : Mitch McConnell .
McConnell , the shrewd new Senate majority leader , acknowledged that the immigration matter poses “ a challenge ” but said little about the way forward — even as the DHS funding battle begins in earnest on Tuesday , senators said .
It was vintage McConnell : Listen to the competing options Republicans lay out , see whether there ’ s consensus , keep your cards very close to your vest — then strike when allies and opponents alike are trying to figure out your next move . And as McConnell now heads into a tumultuous period atop the Senate , with huge fights looming over immigration , national security , the budget , highway funding and taxes , the Kentucky Republican is playing an inside game to keep his party ’ s warring factions together and outmaneuver a recalcitrant and robust Democratic minority .
Yet with 54 GOP seats , six shy of overriding a Democratic filibuster and 13 short of overriding a presidential veto , McConnell says there are limits to what he can do .
“ What I would also remind everybody and mentioned to our House friends at our joint retreat : How would you like to have to get 261 votes on almost everything you do ? ” McConnell said in a phone interview . “ I hope that some day we will have a supermajority in the Senate , but for 100 years we haven ’ t , and there are some obvious limitations . ”
To overcome the next round of tests , McConnell has set up meetings and briefings to get back-channel intelligence with the blocs of his caucus . He has instituted a weekly Wednesday meeting with committee chairmen in the Strom Thurmond Room just off the floor , where he suggested last week he may hold off on pushing new Iran sanctions until after March , senators said . He promises to invite the 12 GOP freshmen to monthly sessions in his leadership suite , which boasts grand views of the National Mall . He ’ s even inviting Utah Sen. Mike Lee , leader of the Senate ’ s conservative Steering Committee and close ally of tea party firebrand Ted Cruz , to sit in on his weekly leadership meetings .
To keep his caucus on the same page , McConnell sends out nightly emails to all GOP senators , including one that defended his refusal to let Democrats stage brief debates on their amendments to the Keystone XL oil pipeline bill before Republicans tabled them — a move that had given the Democrats a rallying cry . To help his most vulnerable senators , McConnell is also on an aggressive fundraising drive , including helping North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr pull in $ 1.1 million last Wednesday night , while vowing to help promote their proposals on the floor and give them chances to break from the party line .
To keep tabs on the House , McConnell leans heavily on Speaker John Boehner ( R-Ohio ) . For intelligence on Democrats , Texas Sen. John Cornyn , the GOP majority whip , often shares useful tidbits after working out in the Senate gym nearly every morning with New York Sen. Chuck Schumer , a top Democratic leader .
“ We talk a little business , we talk a little smack , ” said Cornyn , who typically runs on the treadmill while Schumer rides the exercise bike .
While the final outcome of the legislative fights remains an open question , what McConnell can control is the Senate ’ s schedule . To that end , he has promised a return to so-called regular order , loosening the grip on the amendment process from the days that Nevada Sen. Harry Reid , now the Democratic minority leader , ran the chamber . The move , Republicans say , is an attempt to restore the Senate to its deliberative nature , but it could very well slow down the GOP agenda .
In his first legislative test , McConnell pushed through the bill to mandate construction of Keystone , after three weeks of at times acrimonious debate and 47 votes on the floor .
When McConnell announced that the number of votes on amendments had exceeded the 15 that Democrats had allowed in all of 2014 , Hawaii Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz jokingly told the GOP leader he “ wanted to applaud , but I ’ m on Team Blue . ”
There were so many votes that Sen. Claire McCaskill ( D-Mo . ) told McConnell he needed to limit them to 10 minutes apiece , rather than letting them drag on to 15 minutes , saying that “ if mothers ran the Senate , they would understand the concept of behavior modification . ”
“ If he were a mother , he would understand you have to inflict some pain in order to get behavior to modify , ” McCaskill later said , recounting her conversation with the majority leader on the Senate floor .
Still , the Keystone pipeline , which was approved in the Senate last week with the backing of nine Democrats , amounted to a legislative layup compared with the rigorous battles ahead .
On Tuesday , Senate Democrats plan to filibuster the House ’ s Homeland Security funding bill , which includes provisions to block President Barack Obama ’ s unilateral decision to defer deportations for roughly 5 million undocumented immigrants . Senate Democrats say they ’ ll accept only a clean bill , giving McConnell a choice : He can heed the Democratic demands or push the fight closer to the Feb. 27 deadline , risking a shutdown for an agency central to national security .
“ I didn ’ t set the high expectations : It was Mitch McConnell and every other candidate , who said , ‘ We were going to stop the amnesty ; we are going to stop Obamacare ; we are going to take on this president , ’ ” said Rep. Tim Huelskamp ( R-Kan. ) .
Added Rep. Mick Mulvaney ( R-S.C. ) : “ All I know is 60 votes has been the rule in the Senate for a long time . Other Republican Congresses have gotten stuff done . Go find a way to make it happen . ”
McConnell decided to move the measure straight to the floor , bypassing the regular order that would have allowed the Senate Appropriations Committee to take it up initially .
Senate Appropriations Chairman Thad Cochran ( R-Miss . ) said letting his panel consider the bill first “ would be my preference. ” But , he added , “ It ’ s a leadership call . ”
McConnell , who clearly knows where the votes are in the Senate , doesn ’ t want conservatives to think he ’ s planning to do anything other than try to pass the House plan — though he ’ ll clearly need some Plan B after the Democrats block it .
Asked Friday whether he would rule out moving a Homeland Security bill that doesn ’ t block Obama ’ s immigration policies , McConnell said he didn ’ t have “ any announcements to make today about the way forward on that. ” And , asked whether he would bring up the House bill repeatedly to spotlight the Democratic obstruction , McConnell laughed and said : “ How many different ways are you going to ask the same question ? ”
Given the nature of the Senate , where the minority can stall and derail legislation , McConnell is trying to keep expectations in check while also promising to be fair to the president ’ s nominees . ( He said he “ absolutely ” would bring the nomination of Loretta Lynch for attorney general to the floor for a confirmation vote . ) Since voters started popularly electing senators in 1914 , McConnell said , GOP senators have never occupied more than 55 seats .
“ In other words , the American people have never given us the kind of hammerlock on the Senate that the Democrats had during the New Deal , during the Great Society and the first few years of Barack Obama . That ’ s just the way it is , ” McConnell said .
Asked whether he was lowering expectations , McConnell deadpanned : “ No , it ’ s just stating the facts . ”
Just as he ’ s managed to run the Senate floor , he ’ s also been on a relentless fundraising drive — and last week , the two conflicted . McConnell , the Republicans ’ biggest fundraising draw , was slated to headline back-to-back money events Wednesday night for his party ’ s efforts to keep its thin majority , but his new freewheeling Senate had scores more amendments left to consider .
Mississippi Sen. Roger Wicker , head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee , buttonholed McConnell on the floor and pointed to the clock as it was quickly approaching dinnertime . The two parties later agreed to delay the rest of the votes until the next day , allowing McConnell to swing by two events , including the big cash haul for Burr .
“ Of course , first and foremost — we have a job to do , ” said Wicker . “ But we had people who planned for quite some time and were expecting to see us . And we have to be mindful of that , also . ”
The next day , Burr pushed an amendment to reauthorize the federal Land and Water Conservation Fund , but attaching it to the Keystone pipeline could have complicated its chances for quick passage in the House . So McConnell persuaded three GOP senators — Georgia ’ s David Perdue and Johnny Isakson , and Jerry Moran of Kansas — to flip their votes and oppose the Burr plan . It was defeated by one vote , though Burr received assurances it would come up again and Isakson now hopes McConnell will repay the favor .
“ To accommodate the leader was the right thing to do , ” Isakson said . “ Hopefully , I got a chip in the barrel somewhere . ”
McConnell also did a favor for Ohio Sen . Rob Portman , who could face a tough reelection next year , by putting forward his energy efficiency proposal in one of the first votes of the new Congress .
“ He has spent a lot of time with those of us who are up in 2016 , ” Portman said .
In the interview , McConnell said the free-flowing set of amendment votes will also offer his vulnerable senators an opportunity to show independence from their party ’ s leadership . That , he contended , didn ’ t happen in Senate votes leading up to the 2014 elections that red-state Democratic senators lost in states like Arkansas , North Carolina , Louisiana and Alaska .
“ Many of these red-state Democrats were defeated with ads that said they voted with the president 98 percent of the time , ” McConnell said . “ In other words , they were not able to have the opportunity to demonstrate through voting on the Senate floor their differences with the national Democratic Party . I think our senators from blue and purple states appreciate the opportunity to point out to their constituents where they may differ with us on some of the issues . ”
Often , few senators know his next step . When Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse ( D-R.I. ) pushed an amendment saying climate change is not a “ hoax , ” Republicans saw an opportunity to vote for it because it did not attribute the phenomenon to human activity . But virtually nobody knew that was the GOP ’ s plan until McConnell made his preference known moments before the vote from the well of the chamber , sources said .
“ Sen . McConnell is a famously deep thinker , ” Cornyn said , “ and he keeps a lot of his thoughts to himself . ”","At a closed-door lunch late last month, one Republican senator after another questioned how their party will escape its political jam on immigration.

“Sen. McConnell is a famously deep thinker,” Cornyn said, “and he keeps a lot of his thoughts to himself.”",www.politico.com,left,EaV7N5P1oHbCu4W8

Harry Reid .
It ’ s unlikely Mr. Reid had a President Trump in mind when he pulled the so-called “ nuclear option ” trigger three years ago , changing Senate rules to eviscerate the use of a filibuster to block presidential nominees .
Set up to help President Obama ’ s picks overcome GOP opposition , those same rules now will clear the path for Sen. Jeff Sessions to become the new attorney general , Rep. Tom Price to head Health and Human Services and two billionaires to lead the Treasury and Commerce departments .
Liberal interest groups are pleading with Democrats to fight the nominees , even though there ’ s not a lot they can do without the filibuster and against a unified GOP .
Despite that , those who helped Mr. Reid said they have no regrets .
“ I supported what was done , ” said Sen. Ron Wyden , Oregon Democrat . “ I think it was in the public interest then . I think it is still in the public interest . ”
The Constitution gives the president the power to nominate top officials and the Senate the role of providing “ advice and consent. ” That has been understood to mean senators must vote to approve each nominee — and , in recent decades , it has meant a nominee must be able to survive a filibuster .
Both parties trade blame for who ’ s responsible for things . Democrats , however , intensified the partisan battles under President George W. Bush , using the filibuster to prevent him from naming a series of conservative appeals court judges .
The GOP retaliated under Mr. Obama . Mr. Reid , despite having been part of the Bush-era filibusters , promised to defend the use of the tool as leader . He didn ’ t . With the support of his fellow Democrats he used a shortcut procedure to change Senate rules : Any nominee save for the Supreme Court can now be confirmed by majority vote .
Under the new rules Mr. Reid managed to push through controversial Obama picks including Alejandro Mayorkas as deputy secretary at Homeland Security and former Rep. Melvin Watt becoming director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency .
The Senate also voted to confirm three judges — Patricia Ann Millett and Cornelia T.L . Pillard in 2013 and Robert Leon Wilkins in 2014 — to the powerful U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C . Circuit , which hears a number of cases involving federal agencies and has become a proving ground for future Supreme Court nominees .
The bench of the D.C . Circuit is now composed of seven Democrat-appointed justices and four Republican-appointed justices .
“ This is not about Democrats versus Republicans , ” Mr. Reid said at the time of the rules change . “ This is about making Washington work — regardless of who is in the White House or who controls the Senate . ”
After Republicans won control of the Senate , the filibuster was less important . They could use other tools , such as control of committees and the calendar , to delay Mr. Obama ’ s nominees — or use their majority to defeat ones that did come up for a vote .
Democrats had been confident of keeping control of the White House with Hillary Clinton and of taking back control of the Senate . Mr. Reid , who is retiring at the end of this year , even encouraged Democrats to consider expanding his use of the nuclear option to eliminate the 60-vote threshold for Supreme Court nominees .
“ It ’ s clear to me that if the Republicans try to filibuster another circuit court judge , but especially a Supreme Court justice , I ’ ve told ‘ em how and I ’ ve done it , not just talking about it . I did it in changing the rules of the Senate . It ’ ll have to be done again , ” Mr. Reid told Talking Points Memo .
Now it ’ s the GOP that is considering that step , with Mr. Trump poised to make a Supreme Court pick and Democrats ’ incoming leader , Sen. Charles E. Schumer , threatening a filibuster .
Still , Democrats maintain the decision has not come back to haunt them .
Asked whether he regrets the decision , Sen. Richard Blumenthal , the Connecticut Democrat who has announced he opposes Mr. Price ’ s nomination , said , “ That is the most common question that has been asked of me ” since the election .

Although the 68-year-old nominee is expected to ultimately win confirmation in the Republican-controlled Senate , Tuesday 's questioning affords Democrats another major opportunity to send sparks flying and promote their own White House ambitions .
During now-Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh 's Supreme Court confirmation hearings late last year , Booker compared himself to the Thracian gladiator Spartacus and openly suggested he would be expelled from the Senate for defying a procedural norm , even though no one else raised that possibility . And Harris , in a dramatic made-for-social-media moment , openly suggested Kavanaugh was lying and hiding ties to Trump 's inner circle , only to reveal hours later she had no evidence to back up her assertion .
Overseeing Tuesday 's hearing will be Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-S.C. , the new chairman of the Judiciary Committee , who excoriated Democrats during the Kavanaugh hearings for hiding -- then promoting -- a series of lurid , uncorroborated sexual misconduct allegations against the judge dating back decades .
Graham , who will lead off the hearing with an opening statement before each senator has approximately ten minutes to question Barr , has said he will ask the nominee for his thoughts on Special Counsel Robert Mueller 's Russia investigation . Barr , as head of the Justice Department , would take over from acting attorney general Matthew Whitaker and oversee Mueller 's work .
`` I ’ m going to ask him , ‘ Do you see any reason to fire Mr. Mueller based on what you know now for cause ? ’ '' Graham told `` Fox News Sunday '' host Chris Wallace . `` ‘ Do you trust Mr. Mueller to be fair to the President and the country ? ’ ‘ Will you make sure he can finish his job ? ’ ‘ If you get the report , will you be as transparent as possible ? ’ I ’ ve asked him those questions , and I ’ m very comfortable with his answers . ''
Barr , who like Kavanaugh is a practicing Catholic , will tell the committee that he believes Mueller should be permitted to conclude his investigation and that he thinks Congress and the public should be able to see the results of Mueller 's labor . Those statements , released ahead of the hearing , were aimed at pre-empting some of the most significant questions Barr will face from Democrats .
Separately , Graham sounded a note of caution to the Democrats he chastised during the Kavanaugh hearings .
“ I ’ m going to let it be up to [ Democrats ] , '' Graham told Politico . `` You pick these fights at your own peril . [ Barr will ] be challenged for sure . Hopefully respectfully . ''
In her own statement to the paper , Hawaii Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono -- who has said Kavanaugh did not deserve due process because of his conservative beliefs -- countered : “ I hope that Lindsey Graham can be the Lindsey Graham that I worked on immigration reform with , and not the Lindsey Graham who yelled during the Kavanaugh hearing . ”
FLASHBACK : HIRONO SAYS KAVANUAGH DOES N'T DESERVE FAIR TREATMENT BECAUSE HE 'S A CONSERVATIVE
Barr , like Kavanaugh , will not be attending his first confirmation hearing on Tuesday . He previously served as attorney general from 1991 to 1993 , and his confirmation hearings nearly 30 years ago went off largely without incident .
But the stakes are wildly distinct this time around , as Democrats seek assurances that Mueller will be allowed to continue his work . Whitaker has refused to recuse himself from overseeing the Russia probe that he had publicly said was nearing its legal limits . ( House Democrats have ordered Whitaker to testify about that decision . )
`` I ’ m keeping an open mind ; we had a very constructive meeting this last week , '' Sen. Chris Coons , D-Del. , said on `` Fox News Sunday . ''
`` I would need a firm commitment that he wouldn ’ t allow any interference in the Mueller investigation -- - that he will allow it to reach its conclusion and he will release his report to the public , '' Coons continued .
Sen. Chuck Grassley , R-Iowa , who formerly chaired the Judiciary Committee , said Barr 's prepared remarks should have already put those concerns to rest .
`` What more assurance can he give to Democrats ? '' Grassley asked Monday evening on Fox News ' `` The Story with Martha MacCallum . '' He added : `` If that 's the big thing that 's holding up their support of him , he ought to be able to get through the Senate like he did three times earlier in his career . ''
Barr 's own comments about the Mueller investigation have attracted scrutiny , including an unsolicited memo he sent the Justice Department last year criticizing the special counsel 's inquiry into whether Trump had sought to obstruct justice . Barr has asserted that the memo was narrowly focused on a single theory of obstruction and did n't touch the broader questions surrounding Russian election interference .
In his statement , Barr also called Mueller a friend he 's known personally and professionally for 30 years . Barr 's oversight is especially significant since Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein , who appointed Mueller and who has overseen his day-to-day work , is expected to step down soon after Barr is confirmed .
The nominee must also convince Republicans he 's sufficiently supportive of Trump 's tough-on-crime and hardline immigration agenda , although there are no serious concerns he will have difficulty garnering the simple majority of votes necessary to win confirmation . Republicans currently hold 53 of the Senate 's 100 seats .
Democrats will almost certainly grill Barr on the expansive view of presidential power he 's displayed at the Justice Department and in the years since .
As deputy attorney general , Barr advised then-President George H.W . Bush that he did not need congressional approval to attack Iraq . Earlier , when he led the Justice Department 's Office of Legal Counsel , he wrote opinions that allowed the U.S. government to invade Panama and arrest its dictator , Manuel Noriega , as well as to capture suspects without the consent of their host nations .
As attorney general in 1992 , he endorsed Bush 's pardons of Reagan administration officials in the Iran-Contra scandal .
Barr has discussed those decisions in depth in the past but may be pressed on them again , especially in the context of the Mueller investigation .
In the wake of the bipartisan criminal justice reform legislation that the White House has touted as one of Trump 's signature achievements , Barr can also expect questions concerning his past work on criminal justice . During his first stint as attorney general , Barr advocated building more prisons , making penalties more severe and swift and using laws to keep criminals behind bars longer .
Now , Barr will tell lawmakers that he supports the First Step Act , the sweeping criminal justice overhaul . Trump has touted the law as a bipartisan effort to address concerns that too many Americans were imprisoned for nonviolent crimes as a result of the drug war . Barr opposed a 2015 bill that contained many of the same key elements as the First Step Act .
His prepared remarks show Barr will tell lawmakers that he would `` diligently implement '' the First Step Act . The measure `` recognizes the progress we have made over the past three decades , '' he says .
Still , Barr says the Justice Department must `` keep up the pressure '' on chronic , violent criminals . Advocates fear Barr 's views have not significantly changed since the early 1990s .
And , as the ongoing partial federal government shutdown over funding for Trump 's proposed border wall drags on , immigration policy is also expected to take center stage on Tuesday .
In his prepared remarks , Barr says he 'll continue to prioritize immigration enforcement and adds the government must be able to hold and remove people who illegally enter the country .
Barr 's comments reflect similar thinking to former Attorney General Jeff Sessions , who drew heavy criticism from immigration activists for enforcing immigration laws that led to an increase in family separations among illegal immigrants caught crossing the border .
Sessions also used his authority to narrow the scope of possible asylum claims , which he charged were often fraudulent efforts to gain access to the U.S. , rather than legitimate attempts to avoid particularized persecution based on protected characteristics like politics or religion .
Barr , based on his prepared remarks , will tell senators that the Justice Department can not allow people to flout America 's legal system by `` crashing in through the back door .

us_senate,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/2019/7/10/20688010/senate-election-security-mitch-mcconnell,The Senate will finally hold a briefing on election security on Wednesday,2019-07-10,"Li Zhou, Alissa Wilkinson, Sigal Samuel, Terry Nguyen, Rebecca Jennings, Hannah Brown, Lauren Katz","With a little over a year until the 2020 elections — and growing concerns about foreign interference — the Senate will finally hold a briefing on election security on Wednesday .
This private briefing , something that Democrats have pushed for , for months , is expected to include Trump administration officials from the Department of Homeland Security , the FBI , and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence , according to The Hill . It takes place place amidst Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ’ s ongoing opposition to the consideration of election security legislation .
While both Republicans and Democrats have expressed concerns about potential interference in 2020 by Russia and other foreign powers — and some Senate committees have even passed a bipartisan election security bill or two — GOP lawmakers have generally been more reluctant to take up any concrete measures . That ’ s partly because of how staunchly McConnell has pushed back .
“ I think the majority leader just is of the view that this debate reaches no conclusion , ” Sen. Roy Blunt ( R-MO ) said at a hearing earlier this year , adding that he didn ’ t see the point in considering any election security bills in committee if they simply weren ’ t going to go anywhere .
At the heart of McConnell ’ s concerns with these laws is both an ideological worry ( that they would give the federal government too much control over state and local elections ) — and a political one . Trump has previously discouraged any talk about election security , because he views it as connected with questions about the legitimacy of his 2016 victory . It ’ s possible lawmakers are refraining from additional focus on this subject in order to placate him .
“ I ’ m open to considering legislation , but it has to be directed in a way that doesn ’ t undermine state and local control of elections . The Democrats ... would like to nationalize everything , ” McConnell previously told Fox News . “ They want the federal government to take over broad swaths of the election process because they think that would somehow benefit them . ”
Although this briefing was viewed as victory for Democrats — who hope it will convince their Republican colleagues to consider passing additional legislation — Republican stances on taking further action on election security might not change much .
It ’ s unclear whether this briefing is going to change anything
While it ’ s notable that lawmakers are holding this briefing , it remains to be seen whether the information shared as part of the meeting will be enough to spur further action .
The actions of the Republican-controlled Senate up until this point seem to suggest they might not . Despite repeated warnings from high-level government officials on the subject , McConnell , in particular , has seemed relatively immovable on the issue .
Beyond passing legislation that would prevent anyone convicted of election interference from obtaining a US visa , the Senate has allowed several bills addressing election security to fall by the wayside . The Protecting American Votes and Elections Act would require the use of paper ballots in American elections . The Defending the Integrity of Voting Systems Act would make hacking into an election a federal crime . And the Foreign Influence Reporting in Elections Act would require political campaigns to report contact from foreign governments to the FBI . None of them have been passed .
As a result of this inaction , the US Senate — which allocated $ 380 million in election security funds last year — is now effectively promoting a do-nothing approach to a subject that special counsel Robert Mueller and countless national security officials have raised as a serious threat that requires additional action . FBI Director Christopher Wray has gone so far as to call 2018 the “ dress rehearsal for the big show in 2020 . ”
Although US intelligence agencies and other bodies are doing what they can to bolster American defenses before the 2020 election , Republican leadership appears content to sit idly by despite numerous warnings about the need for more resources to prevent potential breaches .
McConnell ’ s unwillingness to tackle election security isn ’ t just sending a political message , it could have major consequences . Democrats are hoping an in-depth briefing about the risks the US faces might push Republicans to change course .","With a little over a year until the 2020 elections — and growing concerns about foreign interference — the Senate will finally hold a briefing on election security on Wednesday.

Trump has previously discouraged any talk about election security, because he views it as connected with questions about the legitimacy of his 2016 victory. It’s possible lawmakers are refraining from additional focus on this subject in order to placate him.

“I’m open to considering legislation, but it has to be directed in a way that doesn’t undermine state and local control of elections. The Democrats ... would like to nationalize everything,” McConnell previously told Fox News. “They want the federal government to take over broad swaths of the election process because they think that would somehow benefit them.”

Although this briefing was viewed as victory for Democrats — who hope it will convince their Republican colleagues to consider passing additional legislation — Republican stances on taking further action on election security might not change much.

It’s unclear whether this briefing is going to change anything

While it’s notable that lawmakers are holding this briefing, it remains to be seen whether the information shared as part of the meeting will be enough to spur further action.

The actions of the Republican-controlled Senate up until this point seem to suggest they might not. Despite repeated warnings from high-level government officials on the subject, McConnell, in particular, has seemed relatively immovable on the issue.

Beyond passing legislation that would prevent anyone convicted of election interference from obtaining a US visa, the Senate has allowed several bills addressing election security to fall by the wayside. The Protecting American Votes and Elections Act would require the use of paper ballots in American elections. The Defending the Integrity of Voting Systems Act would make hacking into an election a federal crime. And the Foreign Influence Reporting in Elections Act would require political campaigns to report contact from foreign governments to the FBI. None of them have been passed.

As a result of this inaction, the US Senate — which allocated $380 million in election security funds last year — is now effectively promoting a do-nothing approach to a subject that special counsel Robert Mueller and countless national security officials have raised as a serious threat that requires additional action. FBI Director Christopher Wray has gone so far as to call 2018 the “dress rehearsal for the big show in 2020.”

Although US intelligence agencies and other bodies are doing what they can to bolster American defenses before the 2020 election, Republican leadership appears content to sit idly by despite numerous warnings about the need for more resources to prevent potential breaches.

McConnell’s unwillingness to tackle election security isn’t just sending a political message, it could have major consequences. Democrats are hoping an in-depth briefing about the risks the US faces might push Republicans to change course.",www.vox.com,left,4fpLlEBJDYJ32yP3

Al Franken Says He'll Cooperate With Investigation Into Allegations He Groped A Woman Without Her Consent,,"Tarini Parti, Molly Hensley-Clancy","When Tweeden returned to the US , she said she was looking through a CD of photos provided by a photographer on the trip and found one of the now-senator groping her while she was asleep . Tweeden 's post includes the photo , which shows Franken smiling and touching her breasts while posing for the camera .
At a press conference last week , Tweeden elaborated : `` I pushed him off with my hands and I just remember I almost punched him . Because every time I see him now my hands clench into fists , '' she said .
`` I immediately pushed him away with both of my hands against his chest and told him if he ever did that to me again I wouldn ’ t be so nice about it the next time . ''
`` I said ‘ OK ’ so he would stop badgering me , '' Tweeden writes . `` We did the line leading up to the kiss and then he came at me , put his hand on the back of my head , mashed his lips against mine and aggressively stuck his tongue in my mouth . ''
The wave of accusations began with a first-person post on talk radio KABC 's website , where Tweeden wrote that Franken , the headliner for the show organized by the USO , wrote her into his script without asking for her input . `` When I saw the script , Franken had written a moment when his character comes at me for a ‘ kiss ’ . I suspected what he was after , but I figured I could turn my head at the last minute , or put my hand over his mouth , to get more laughs from the crowd , '' Tweeden writes .
`` My immediate reaction was disgust , ” she told the HuffPo . “ But my secondary reaction was disappointment . I was excited to be there and to meet him . ''
Two other women spoke anonymously to to HuffPo , saying Franken also touched them inappropriately during photos . One said Franken similarly grabbed her butt as they were taking a photo together in 2007 at an event hosted by the Minnesota Women 's Political Caucus . The other said that Franken cupped her butt during a 2008 Democratic fundraiser in Minneapolis and suggested they go to the bathroom together .
Lindsay Menz told CNN that Franken grabbed her butt in 2010 as they were taking a photo together at the Minnesota State Fair .
Morning news anchor Leeann Tweeden first accused Franken of misconduct last week , dating back to 2006 when he was a comedian headed to entertain US troops overseas along with other celebrities . Her public statements prompted three other women to come forward with accounts that Franken groped them during photo ops or political events .
After the first woman came forward with her account of being kissed aggressively and groped while she was asleep , Franken said he recalled their interactions differently . He then said he would cooperate with a Senate investigation .
Four women now say Democratic Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota groped them without their consent , allegations that have prompted calls for a Senate ethics investigation .
`` I took that as the final ‘ I got the last laugh. ’ He knew I would n't see it until I got home and I was away from everybody else , '' Tweeden said of the photo , during Thursday 's press conference . `` To know it in the context of the entire trip and what happened in the entire two weeks is telling to me . ''
Tweeden said she `` made sure never to be alone with him again '' for the rest of the two-week tour , but that Franken made `` snide comments '' and sometimes defaced photos of her , printed for autograph signing after their performances , with devil horns .
She said the final incident , when Franken touched her breasts while she was sleeping , left her feeling particularly disempowered because she could n't confront Franken in person about it in the moment .
`` In context of assaulting me back stage and all the little petty things he was doing to belittle me and how he treated me in succession and then it ended with that , and how I was left to feel without being able to say whatever I needed to say to his face , '' she said . `` Great . While I was sleeping do you that to me and I ca n't even say anything to him . ''
In a statement , Franken at first said he had a different account of the rehearsal and regrets taking the picture .
“ I certainly don ’ t remember the rehearsal for the skit in the same way , but I send my sincerest apologies to Leeann . As to the photo , it was clearly intended to be funny but was n't . I should n't have done it . ”
He later put out a more detailed statement , saying he would `` gladly cooperate '' with an ethics investigation , which Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has already called for . He also apologized and said he understands `` why we need to listen to and believe women ’ s experiences . ''
`` Coming from the world of comedy , I 've told and written a lot of jokes that I once thought were funny but later came to realize were just plain offensive , '' Franken said . `` But the intentions behind my actions are n't the point at all . It 's the impact these jokes had on others that matters . And I 'm sorry it 's taken me so long to come to terms with that . ''
Franken also said he does n't remember the rehearsal for the skit and elaborated on the picture Tweeden shared .
`` I do n't know what was in my head when I took that picture , and it does n't matter , '' he said . `` There 's no excuse . I look at it now and I feel disgusted with myself . It is n't funny . It 's completely inappropriate . It 's obvious how Leeann would feel violated by that picture . And , what 's more , I can see how millions of other women would feel violated by it — women who have had similar experiences in their own lives , women who fear having those experiences , women who look up to me , women who have counted on me . ''
Before Franken 's second statement , McConnell said in statement that the `` Ethics Committee should review the matter . '' `` I hope the Democratic Leader will join me on this , '' McConnell said . `` Regardless of party , harassment and assault are completely unacceptable — in the workplace or anywhere else . '' Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement that he supports the call for an ethics committee investigation . `` Sexual harassment is never acceptable and must not be tolerated . ''
Should the Senate Ethics Committee take up an investigation into Franken ’ s conduct , it ’ s unlikely that any information or findings will be made public . The committee very rarely takes any action on the cases before it and rarely announces it when they do .
The committee has not taken action against a single senator , since 2011 when it referred then-senator John Ensign to the Justice Department and the Federal Election Commission , amid a scandal over his affair with a staffer and alleged use of his position to benefit her husband . The committee has only published two statements since then , one in 2012 that included two letters of “ admonition ” related to the Ensign scandal , and one in 2014 announcing that they ’ d hired a new staff member .
Aside from those releases , the committee puts out an annual report noting the number of cases that have been put before the committee and the number they acted on , with no details about the inquiries themselves . In its 2016 report , the committee said that it had received 63 allegations of some kind of violation of Senate rules . Of those , the committee reported that it took a “ preliminary inquiry ” of five of them and then dismissed three . The other two were apparently left unresolved .
In a statement responding to reporters ' questions about Franken 's conduct in the workplace , eight women who were former Franken staffers , called him a `` champion for women . ''
`` Many of us spent years working for Senator Franken in Minnesota and Washington . In our time working for the Senator , he treated us with the utmost respect , '' the statement said . `` He valued our work and our opinions and was a champion for women both in the legislation he supported and in promoting women to leadership roles in our offices . ''
Asked about the allegations against Franken , White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said during Thursday 's press briefing that the White House supports the Senate investigating the matter .
`` It appears that the Senate is looking into that which they should , and we feel that 's an appropriate action , '' she said .
Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and the state 's Democratic Farmer Labor party both echoed calls for an ethics investigation . In a statement , the party chairman said he was `` incredibly disappointed '' in Franken .
Tweeden did not immediately respond to ███ for comment . The USO did not respond to a request for comment . Franken is the first sitting lawmaker in the aftermath of the allegations against Hollywood tycoon Harvey Weinstein to be named by an accuser of sexual misconduct .
Tweeden decided to tell her story after listening to California Democratic Rep. Jackie Speier talking about being sexually assaulted as a young congressional aide .
`` At that moment , I thought to myself , Al Franken did that exact same thing to me , '' Tweeden wrote . `` I had locked up those memories of helplessness and violation for a long time , but they all came rushing back to me and my hands clinched into fists like it was yesterday . ''
`` Senator Franken , you wrote the script . But there ’ s nothing funny about sexual assault . ''
Tweeden told Good Morning America on Friday that it was n't her intention for Franken to step down from the Senate .
`` I did n't do this to have him step down , '' Tweeden said . `` I think Al Franken does a lot of good things in the Senate . You know , I think that 's for the people of Minnesota to decide . I 'm not calling for him to step down . That was never my intention . ''
Tweeden 's account is not the first allegation of sexually inappropriate behavior against Franken . The Minnesota Democrat 's first Senate campaign , in 2008 , was damaged by revelations that he had made a joke in a Saturday Night Live writer 's room meeting about raping the television journalist Lesley Stahl .
“ I give the pills to Lesley Stahl . Then when Lesley is passed out , I take her to the closet and rape her , '' Franken said , according to a 1995 article in New York magazine . `` Or ‘ That ’ s why you never see Lesley until February . Or , ‘ When she passes out . I put her in various positions and take pictures of her . ’ ”
In his 2017 memoir , Franken wrote that he `` was n't sorry '' for the joke , which he called `` stupid . '' `` I was just doing my job , '' he said .","When Tweeden returned to the US, she said she was looking through a CD of photos provided by a photographer on the trip and found one of the now-senator groping her while she was asleep.

us_senate,Vox,0,http://www.vox.com/2017/1/2/14123496/mitch-mcconnell-motives,Mitch McConnell’s entire career has been about gaining power. What happens now that he has it?,2017-01-02,"Jeff Stein, Andrew Prokop, Jen Kirby, Ezra Klein, Alissa Wilkinson, Sigal Samuel, Terry Nguyen","A few things are curiously missing from the Mitch McConnell–Elaine Chao Archives at the University of Louisville . At an exhibit designed to celebrate the Senate majority leader and his wife , there ’ s almost no mention of any bills McConnell has authored in his 32 years in the Senate . There ’ s virtually nothing about the people he ’ s helped , nothing to highlight courageous speeches made on the Senate floor .
Instead , McConnell 's exhibit almost entirely pays homage to the elections he ’ s won — for high school student government ; for Louisville county executive ; for his first election to the Kentucky Senate ; for his reelection bids to the US Senate .
“ All the things he chooses to present to the people who come there are about his races , ” says Alec MacGillis , a ProPublica reporter and author of a 2014 McConnell biography , The Cynic : The Political Education of Mitch McConnell , in an interview . `` And that 's all it is . There 's almost nothing in those rooms about what he 's actually accomplished in all of the decades he ’ s been in office . ''
This is , MacGillis thinks , the key to understanding the inscrutable Kentucky senator . On January 20 , McConnell , 74 , will become one of the most powerful men in America and one of the few potential checks on Donald Trump ’ s power .
So what McConnell really cares about will soon become a question of immense importance . Everyone has a rough idea of Speaker Paul Ryan ’ s vision for America because he likes to write it down and give speeches about it . For McConnell , the answer is both simpler and more inscrutable — he is obsessed with electoral self-preservation and improvement , with no clear larger purpose .
`` Far more than other politicians , it really has been about simply the rise itself . Winning the next cycle . Staying in power as long as you can . Rising in the leadership ranks to the point where you are the leader of the body , ” MacGillis says .
In interviews with close to 100 friends and colleagues , MacGillis tracked McConnell from his constant striving in high school for positions in student government to his head-spinningly quick rejection of his once-moderate political persona to his refusal to confront or even talk about the most critical policy fights facing his Senate caucus .
McConnell ’ s story is , on the one hand , a fascinatingly revealing account of how someone with so little charisma and so few ideological convictions can still ascend so high up the rungs of power . But it is also one whose last and perhaps most important chapter is yet to be written — one that will finally and conclusively reveal if McConnell has been seeking power all of these years for its own exercise or in service of some greater ( and still unknown ) objective .
`` The big question for the Trump era now that [ McConnell ] has a big Republican majority to work with in the branches is : Will he actually push for substantive ideological gains ? Has all that expediency , all that work , all this thinking about the election all the time — was it all toward this moment where he finally has control and can do what he wants substantively ? ” MacGillis says . `` Or will it continue to just be about the next cycle ? ''
A lightly edited transcript of my conversation with MacGillis follows .
I wanted to start by asking if we could go back to one of your main projects in the McConnell book : to discover his political education and origins .
You say he was a moderate Republican in the [ Kentucky Sen. John Sherman ] Cooper tradition — how real was that , and how do we square that with the conservative McConnell we see today ?
That 's one of the real crucial questions about Mitch . I think it was real , but I also think it was shallow . It 's extraordinary how moderate-to-liberal he was back then — you ca n't really overstate it . It 's hard to believe now , but it was true ; his great model was this liberal Republican from Kentucky who made his name standing up to [ Sen. Joe ] McCarthy , opposing Vietnam , and taking other stances that were very unpopular in Kentucky . And that was his great model early on .
“ All this thinking about the election all the time — was it all toward this moment where he finally has control and can do what he wants substantively ? Or will it continue to just be about the next cycle ? ''
Cooper took him to the signing of the Voting Rights Act when he was an intern on Capitol Hill . McConnell talks about how exciting that was to him . He was very involved in civil rights ; he was adamantly pro-choice . When he was elected county executive in Jefferson County , Kentucky , he repeatedly worked with women 's groups to help stymie anti-abortion legislation in the local government . He kept an arm ’ s length from the gun groups back then . He even recommended a piece by Playboy on moderate Republicanism to someone else .
There was a whole fight in the early ’ 70s between the Goldwater wing and the quite strong moderate-to-liberal wing . And McConnell was on the barricades on the liberal-to-moderate side , arguing for it to prevail . That was totally where he was back then , and the fact that he could then swing so swiftly once he got to Washington in 1984 after winning his first Senate race — he switched so quickly on so many issues , including abortion , to line up with the Reagan wing of the party that was then ascendant . He was not a Reagan person . He had supported [ in Republican presidential primaries ] Ford in ’ 76 , H.W . Bush in ’ 80 ; then he quickly lined himself up with the Reagan Republicans .
My theory of that is : He barely won his first Senate race in ’ 84 , by less than 5,000 votes . Reagan won Kentucky by 280,000 votes . McConnell saw just how much more easily he won Kentucky , did n't want to have such a close election ever again , and it happened so quickly it suggests those early/moderate roots were shallow .
Just to stay on the question of McConnell in the ’ 60s and ’ 70s , do you see the thesis of your work — that he openly says he cares about political expediency to a degree that 's shocking — was that a throughline earlier in McConnell ’ s career ? Were there inklings or origins you point to earlier that fit that description ?
Yes . Even as you saw him as a moderate/liberal Republican earlier on , you saw these glimmers of expediency earlier — you can still see that the overriding desire was to win , and to an extent that 's unusually strong even compared to other politicians .
In a way , you could say it even goes back to his high school campaigning years . He was one of those kids always running for office — high school , college — just always running for student government . Doing whatever he had to do to win those races and just taking it all way too seriously .
I love student government overachiever stories about powerful politicians . There are great anecdotes in the Robert Caro book about LBJ going to incredible lengths to win school races .
In high school government in Louisville , McConnell tried and failed a couple times in his early races . But he finally became the vice president of the student council at duPont Manual High School .
He did this by figuring out that in a student body election , all votes count equally — so he targeted lowerclassmen and unpopular kids , who the upper-class hotshot candidates were looking past . Nameless kids . He stuck pamphlets in their lockers with lists of endorsements he received from `` the president of the Key Club . '' So he targeted the forgotten class of high school .
Then at the University of Louisville , he lost a lot . He lost his races in succession for freshman class president , president of the student senate , and president of the student council . He lost all three and took them pretty hard and decided it was so painful he 'd never lose ever again . Finally , junior year he wins presidency of the student council .
He 's just running all the time . And when he gets to doing his first real elections — running for county government in Louisville — the expediency comes in two ways . One , he 's just incredibly malleable . That 's the thing his political consultants marveled at when I talked to them . In ’ 76 , they were amazed by how he was so physically unskilled — totally lacking of natural charisma and natural political skills — but also very aware of that fact and so utterly willing to let them tell him what to do .
Shooting ads with him was relatively easy . Because as unskilled and hapless as he was , he completely submitted to their instructions far more than most candidates were willing to do .
As he was leaving his previous job with the Department of Justice in the Ford administration in Washington , he saw that the school busing fight was starting to brew back in Louisville . There had been a big busing fight there in the mid- ’ 70s , and McConnell fires off his resignation to Ford saying , `` Thanks for having me ; I 'm going home to Louisville . '' He then threw in a gratuitous paragraph saying , `` Hey , please , take more notice of how concerned people are about school busing and appoint Supreme Court justices who will be more skeptical of the school busing and integration push . '' It was so clear he was doing this to leave a paper trail he could point to when he was running for office later .
It 's such an interesting question how someone with such little political charisma , and so lacking clear ideological convictions , could become the No . 3 or 2 most powerful politician in the United States .
How does he deal with that problem in his early career ? Is it just removing himself from the public eye and minimizing the number of debates and rallies ? Very few all-time great baseball players ca n't field , hit , run , or pitch .
It was an especially crippling drawback for him given that he was running in the upper South , which has a long tradition of charismatic , wisecracking , folksy politicians . That 's even more expected there than it is elsewhere in the country , and he completely lacked that ability . As one of his Kentucky pals said to me , `` He does n't have the personality to wash a shotgun with . ''
He was very aware of this fact and compensated for it mainly by raising tons of money . His great epiphany early on was that he could overcome this deficiency by raising gobs and gobs of money , and then using that money to [ run ] ads that would simply tear down the opponent .
That became his message , over and over . His own popularity was always middling ; people were always ambivalent about him because of his lack of natural charm and constituency ; he 'd just tear down the other guy , so he 'd be left standing as the fallback alternative . In his first run for Senate , he worked with Roger Ailes , who came up with this legendary and notorious ad going after the Democrat with the hound dogs for the missed votes .
So a lot of it was the money . But the other part was being incredibly willing to stake out positions to help you win that one election — and then abandoning them to a degree most politicians would find shameless .
In ’ 76 , running for his first job as county executive , he came out in favor of collective bargaining for public employee unions and won the endorsement of the AFL-CIO in Louisville , and Kentucky was a strong union state . He also won the endorsement of the Courier-Journal , a very influential newspaper . He did that by taking a bunch of center-left positions , including campaign finance reform .
In the years since , he 's admitted — openly ! — that he took both of those positions for political expediency . That they were completely expedient and taken at the time to gain the support of these influential constituencies in Louisville .
If we 're trying to be as generous as possible to the McConnell worldview , what 's the story McConnell 's friends and family would tell in his defense about the narrative of his life ? I haven ’ t really found anything that is n't boilerplate . What is the story they tell you about how he sees his project ?
I spoke to a lot of his friends and close associates for the book , and they had a very hard time answering that question . That was the big last question I would ask them all . And they would be completely flummoxed by it to a really stunning degree — they could n't come up with an answer to it .
And it really feels harsh to say and hard to confront directly , but it really feels that to him , far more than other politicians , it really has been about simply the rise itself . Winning the next cycle . Staying in power as long as you can . Rising in the leadership ranks to the point where you are the leader of the body .
And these are genuine close friends ? People who like him and think he 's fun to hang out with ?
If you really press them to define some ideology or political belief of his , they 'll fall back on very generic talk about how he loves the country and wants the best for it , and how he believes in “ freedom '' and “ democracy . '' But it 's so generic as to be almost meaningless .
You have to see how he himself portrays his accomplishments and portrays his own career . There 's this shrine for him at the University of Louisville , and it 's an extraordinary thing . It 's the Mitch McConnell and Elaine Chao [ McConnell ’ s wife ] archive . And it 's pretty difficult to access .
But in the antechambers of these archives there 's this huge exhibit area , a shrine to McConnell and to Chao . And it has all of these exhibits about his life in politics and his career . And virtually all of the exhibits — all the things he chooses to present to the people who come there — are about his races . The high school races . His race in Louisville . His Senate race . His reelection . It 's just one race after another .
And that 's all it is . There 's almost nothing in those rooms about what he 's actually accomplished in all of those decades in office .
He seems not only devoid of ideological commitments but , in the public eye at least , he just seems devoid of personality too . It 's rare for a public figure to have such an absence of hobbies or nicknames or anything like that .
How does a guy like that get other Republicans in the Senate to support him for this long ? Is there a divide between that bland public image people receive and the person he really is ? Or is the understanding of him as someone who is sort of lifeless accurate once you see it closer up ?
It 's pretty close to the reality of the man . He is said to have a wry , droll , almost English humor in person that does not come through so much in the public persona . But you 're right — the fact that someone so colorless could get so far is extraordinary .
He really is kind of the Keyser Söze of the last year or two . All along , he was the guy who made it happen for the Republicans . Very publicly , with the Supreme Court obstructionism , exploding that norm in a way that worked . And we 've just learned he was more quietly having vast influence behind the scenes with the Russians and the attempts to keep that hacking private before the election .
That 's why , as bland as he is , he 's almost so bland it 's kind of fascinating . He has people in his own caucus to be loyal to him — his lack of classic leadership traits is compensated for with money . Not only did he raise the money for them , he also led the fight on campaign finance — he took the hits for all the Republicans on that . He was willing to put himself out there as the guy who opposed all of these limits .
It earned him scorn in certain corners , but he could take those shots because he knew it would produce affection for him among other Republicans .
The money thing — it 's so telling that the one issue he really cares about and has invested himself in is campaign finance reform . It 's the issue that 's all about the game . It 's a process issue that has everything to do with winning the next election .
I think this is all incredibly useful for a question that — maybe I 'm being dramatic here — but that could help determine the stability of the American republic .
It seems absolutely crucial to determine if McConnell will stand up to Trump on anything . Is there anything in McConnell 's record that gives you faith in that ?
One thing one can say for McConnell , and he 's done it again recently , is that when things really head to the brink — things like the debt ceiling crisis , the fiscal cliff , the government shutdown — it was always McConnell at the very end cutting a deal with [ Vice President Joe ] Biden or whoever to avert the total crisis .
In the end , it was clear he was helping avert disaster . But he was always getting varied appeals from Republicans at those moments . He was using the extremism and nihilism of that wing of the party as a bargaining chip . Saying , `` Hey , Biden or [ Sen. Harry ] Reid , you want to work with me because these guys could take that over the edge . ''
Even that can look like a political expedience argument for maintaining power . Today , Ross Douthat at the New York Times had a column trying to place Trump on the x-axis of populism on the one hand and conservatism on the other , and on the y-axis of authoritarianism on one end and chaos on the other . Where do you put McConnell on that grid ?
I see McConnell stepping into moments to try to avert the total crisis because there is in him just enough of a conservative instinct that at the end of the day [ he ] wants to conserve the country . There 's maybe just enough of that to help avert the crisis at the last moment . But he will get as much out of it as he can for the party .
The best gauge of what he will do is to ask the question , `` What will he think will most help the party in the next cycle ? '' That is how he thinks . That is what it is all about . Whatever his calculus for how they will next perform in 2018 or 2020 — what he needs to do to win those elections — that 's what will guide him .
And that 's what guided him in the Obama years , and that 's what will guide him in the Trump years . His insight was that the way you beat Obama is by grinding things to a halt , which would hurt the Democrats more because they were the party in the White House and the party of government , and because it would undermine Obama 's whole comity shtick . Which paid off beyond McConnell 's wildest dreams by now electing someone who fed off voter anger with Washington dysfunction .
But I think there 's something actually comforting there for liberals . If you 're a Democrat who is terrified of what Paul Ryan wants to do to the safety net , then maybe there 's an opportunity here to exert political pressure he may be genuinely responsive to .
On the other hand , it seems from what you 're saying that the peril here is if standing up to Trump on something important is politically difficult — whether [ McConnell ] fears a Trump-backed primary candidate or for increasing the divisions within the Republican primary — it seems extraordinarily unlikely he 'll do that . Whereas a McCain figure or even a Ryan figure might be more willing to make sacrifices that could hurt the party 's cohesion for the country .
You bring up an important point , which is that it 's not just what will increase the chances for the party faring well but also for himself faring well in the next cycle . You can completely see him steering clear of complications with Trump if he worries it will hurt his own reelection in four years .
During Romney 's election , for so many other years as leader , McConnell was so closely tending to his own personal prospects . At crucial moments when he as the Republican leader should have been stepping forward to really show the way on substantive issues , he was really just not there . Immigration , in 2006 and 2007 , McConnell [ then the leader ] completely ducked out of the debate and did not even speak on the floor . He was just a nonentity and ceded his leadership role , essentially , because of how worried he was about how it would affect his 2008 reelection .
In early summer of 2006 , he went to Bush and said , “ Mr . President , can you pull back the troops in Iraq ? Because I 'm worried how it will affect us in the midterms . ' '' That 's amazing : He said to the president , about the president 's No . 1 initiative : Please reverse yourself for this election cycle .
And then in the past few years : the repeated unwillingness to stand up to the Tea Party wing as it was arriving . His unwillingness to confront it , and its brinksmanship , more publicly . Then there was this game he played with Rand Paul , when Paul took on his anointed guy for that Senate seat in Kentucky — a mild-moderate guy — and McConnell played this very clever game . Once he realized Paul had cut away , McConnell started reaching out to Rand Paul and the Rand Paul crowd even as his own guy was falling .
I have to say one thing I got wrong about McConnell this past year was that I was surprised by the decision with the Supreme Court and the Scalia seat because it seemed like he was doing something ideologically driven and less expedient . It seemed like by refusing to even consider Obama 's nomination , he was risking firing up Democrats in a way that would hurt Republicans .
I wrote about that in the Times — that he was putting his chips out and taking a little risk for ideological gains . And in the end , of course , what followed was that he perhaps saw that blocking that nomination would fire up Republicans more and produce more cohesion for them and that the upset at the Democratic side would dissipate over time . That it would help Republicans win and also secure a lasting conservative ideological advantage .
The big question for the Trump era now that he has a big Republican majority to work with in the branches is : Will he actually push for substantive ideological gains ? Has all that expediency , all that work , all this thinking about the election — was it all toward this moment where he finally has control and can do what he wants substantively ? Or will it continue to just be about the next cycle to the point where he 's reluctant to do what Donald Trump or Paul Ryan wants to do because he fears they will hurt them in the next election ?
That 's the big question . At what point does the permanent campaign end for him ? Or does it never end ?","A few things are curiously missing from the Mitch McConnell–Elaine Chao Archives at the University of Louisville. At an exhibit designed to celebrate the Senate majority leader and his wife, there’s almost no mention of any bills McConnell has authored in his 32 years in the Senate. There’s virtually nothing about the people he’s helped, nothing to highlight courageous speeches made on the Senate floor.

Instead, McConnell's exhibit almost entirely pays homage to the elections he’s won — for high school student government; for Louisville county executive; for his first election to the Kentucky Senate; for his reelection bids to the US Senate.

“All the things he chooses to present to the people who come there are about his races,” says Alec MacGillis, a ProPublica reporter and author of a 2014 McConnell biography, The Cynic: The Political Education of Mitch McConnell, in an interview. ""And that's all it is. There's almost nothing in those rooms about what he's actually accomplished in all of the decades he’s been in office.""

This is, MacGillis thinks, the key to understanding the inscrutable Kentucky senator. On January 20, McConnell, 74, will become one of the most powerful men in America and one of the few potential checks on Donald Trump’s power.

So what McConnell really cares about will soon become a question of immense importance. Everyone has a rough idea of Speaker Paul Ryan’s vision for America because he likes to write it down and give speeches about it. For McConnell, the answer is both simpler and more inscrutable — he is obsessed with electoral self-preservation and improvement, with no clear larger purpose.

""Far more than other politicians, it really has been about simply the rise itself. Winning the next cycle. Staying in power as long as you can. Rising in the leadership ranks to the point where you are the leader of the body,” MacGillis says.

In interviews with close to 100 friends and colleagues, MacGillis tracked McConnell from his constant striving in high school for positions in student government to his head-spinningly quick rejection of his once-moderate political persona to his refusal to confront or even talk about the most critical policy fights facing his Senate caucus.

McConnell’s story is, on the one hand, a fascinatingly revealing account of how someone with so little charisma and so few ideological convictions can still ascend so high up the rungs of power. But it is also one whose last and perhaps most important chapter is yet to be written — one that will finally and conclusively reveal if McConnell has been seeking power all of these years for its own exercise or in service of some greater (and still unknown) objective.

""The big question for the Trump era now that [McConnell] has a big Republican majority to work with in the branches is: Will he actually push for substantive ideological gains? Has all that expediency, all that work, all this thinking about the election all the time — was it all toward this moment where he finally has control and can do what he wants substantively?” MacGillis says. ""Or will it continue to just be about the next cycle?""

A lightly edited transcript of my conversation with MacGillis follows.

The political education of Mitch McConnell

Jeff Stein

I wanted to start by asking if we could go back to one of your main projects in the McConnell book: to discover his political education and origins.

You say he was a moderate Republican in the [Kentucky Sen. John Sherman] Cooper tradition — how real was that, and how do we square that with the conservative McConnell we see today?

Alec MacGillis

That's one of the real crucial questions about Mitch. I think it was real, but I also think it was shallow. It's extraordinary how moderate-to-liberal he was back then — you can't really overstate it. It's hard to believe now, but it was true; his great model was this liberal Republican from Kentucky who made his name standing up to [Sen. Joe] McCarthy, opposing Vietnam, and taking other stances that were very unpopular in Kentucky. And that was his great model early on.

“All this thinking about the election all the time — was it all toward this moment where he finally has control and can do what he wants substantively? Or will it continue to just be about the next cycle?""

Cooper took him to the signing of the Voting Rights Act when he was an intern on Capitol Hill. McConnell talks about how exciting that was to him. He was very involved in civil rights; he was adamantly pro-choice. When he was elected county executive in Jefferson County, Kentucky, he repeatedly worked with women's groups to help stymie anti-abortion legislation in the local government. He kept an arm’s length from the gun groups back then. He even recommended a piece by Playboy on moderate Republicanism to someone else.

There was a whole fight in the early ’70s between the Goldwater wing and the quite strong moderate-to-liberal wing. And McConnell was on the barricades on the liberal-to-moderate side, arguing for it to prevail. That was totally where he was back then, and the fact that he could then swing so swiftly once he got to Washington in 1984 after winning his first Senate race — he switched so quickly on so many issues, including abortion, to line up with the Reagan wing of the party that was then ascendant. He was not a Reagan person. He had supported [in Republican presidential primaries] Ford in ’76, H.W. Bush in ’80; then he quickly lined himself up with the Reagan Republicans.

My theory of that is: He barely won his first Senate race in ’84, by less than 5,000 votes. Reagan won Kentucky by 280,000 votes. McConnell saw just how much more easily he won Kentucky, didn't want to have such a close election ever again, and it happened so quickly it suggests those early/moderate roots were shallow.

Jeff Stein

Just to stay on the question of McConnell in the ’60s and ’70s, do you see the thesis of your work — that he openly says he cares about political expediency to a degree that's shocking — was that a throughline earlier in McConnell’s career? Were there inklings or origins you point to earlier that fit that description?

Alec MacGillis

Yes. Even as you saw him as a moderate/liberal Republican earlier on, you saw these glimmers of expediency earlier — you can still see that the overriding desire was to win, and to an extent that's unusually strong even compared to other politicians.

In a way, you could say it even goes back to his high school campaigning years. He was one of those kids always running for office — high school, college — just always running for student government. Doing whatever he had to do to win those races and just taking it all way too seriously.

Jeff Stein

I love student government overachiever stories about powerful politicians. There are great anecdotes in the Robert Caro book about LBJ going to incredible lengths to win school races.

Alec MacGillis

In high school government in Louisville, McConnell tried and failed a couple times in his early races. But he finally became the vice president of the student council at duPont Manual High School.

He did this by figuring out that in a student body election, all votes count equally — so he targeted lowerclassmen and unpopular kids, who the upper-class hotshot candidates were looking past. Nameless kids. He stuck pamphlets in their lockers with lists of endorsements he received from ""the president of the Key Club."" So he targeted the forgotten class of high school.

Then at the University of Louisville, he lost a lot. He lost his races in succession for freshman class president, president of the student senate, and president of the student council. He lost all three and took them pretty hard and decided it was so painful he'd never lose ever again. Finally, junior year he wins presidency of the student council.

He's just running all the time. And when he gets to doing his first real elections — running for county government in Louisville — the expediency comes in two ways. One, he's just incredibly malleable. That's the thing his political consultants marveled at when I talked to them. In ’76, they were amazed by how he was so physically unskilled — totally lacking of natural charisma and natural political skills — but also very aware of that fact and so utterly willing to let them tell him what to do.

Shooting ads with him was relatively easy. Because as unskilled and hapless as he was, he completely submitted to their instructions far more than most candidates were willing to do.

As he was leaving his previous job with the Department of Justice in the Ford administration in Washington, he saw that the school busing fight was starting to brew back in Louisville. There had been a big busing fight there in the mid-’70s, and McConnell fires off his resignation to Ford saying, ""Thanks for having me; I'm going home to Louisville."" He then threw in a gratuitous paragraph saying, ""Hey, please, take more notice of how concerned people are about school busing and appoint Supreme Court justices who will be more skeptical of the school busing and integration push."" It was so clear he was doing this to leave a paper trail he could point to when he was running for office later.

How did Mitch McConnell become so powerful?

Jeff Stein

It's such an interesting question how someone with such little political charisma, and so lacking clear ideological convictions, could become the No. 3 or 2 most powerful politician in the United States.

How does he deal with that problem in his early career? Is it just removing himself from the public eye and minimizing the number of debates and rallies? Very few all-time great baseball players can't field, hit, run, or pitch.

Alec MacGillis

It was an especially crippling drawback for him given that he was running in the upper South, which has a long tradition of charismatic, wisecracking, folksy politicians. That's even more expected there than it is elsewhere in the country, and he completely lacked that ability. As one of his Kentucky pals said to me, ""He doesn't have the personality to wash a shotgun with.""

He was very aware of this fact and compensated for it mainly by raising tons of money. His great epiphany early on was that he could overcome this deficiency by raising gobs and gobs of money, and then using that money to [run] ads that would simply tear down the opponent.

That became his message, over and over. His own popularity was always middling; people were always ambivalent about him because of his lack of natural charm and constituency; he'd just tear down the other guy, so he'd be left standing as the fallback alternative. In his first run for Senate, he worked with Roger Ailes, who came up with this legendary and notorious ad going after the Democrat with the hound dogs for the missed votes.

So a lot of it was the money. But the other part was being incredibly willing to stake out positions to help you win that one election — and then abandoning them to a degree most politicians would find shameless.

In ’76, running for his first job as county executive, he came out in favor of collective bargaining for public employee unions and won the endorsement of the AFL-CIO in Louisville, and Kentucky was a strong union state. He also won the endorsement of the Courier-Journal, a very influential newspaper. He did that by taking a bunch of center-left positions, including campaign finance reform.

In the years since, he's admitted — openly! — that he took both of those positions for political expediency. That they were completely expedient and taken at the time to gain the support of these influential constituencies in Louisville.

Jeff Stein

If we're trying to be as generous as possible to the McConnell worldview, what's the story McConnell's friends and family would tell in his defense about the narrative of his life? I haven’t really found anything that isn't boilerplate. What is the story they tell you about how he sees his project?

Alec MacGillis

I spoke to a lot of his friends and close associates for the book, and they had a very hard time answering that question. That was the big last question I would ask them all. And they would be completely flummoxed by it to a really stunning degree — they couldn't come up with an answer to it.

And it really feels harsh to say and hard to confront directly, but it really feels that to him, far more than other politicians, it really has been about simply the rise itself. Winning the next cycle. Staying in power as long as you can. Rising in the leadership ranks to the point where you are the leader of the body.

Jeff Stein

And these are genuine close friends? People who like him and think he's fun to hang out with?

Alec MacGillis

If you really press them to define some ideology or political belief of his, they'll fall back on very generic talk about how he loves the country and wants the best for it, and how he believes in “freedom"" and “democracy."" But it's so generic as to be almost meaningless.

You have to see how he himself portrays his accomplishments and portrays his own career. There's this shrine for him at the University of Louisville, and it's an extraordinary thing. It's the Mitch McConnell and Elaine Chao [McConnell’s wife] archive. And it's pretty difficult to access.

But in the antechambers of these archives there's this huge exhibit area, a shrine to McConnell and to Chao. And it has all of these exhibits about his life in politics and his career. And virtually all of the exhibits — all the things he chooses to present to the people who come there — are about his races. The high school races. His race in Louisville. His Senate race. His reelection. It's just one race after another.

And that's all it is. There's almost nothing in those rooms about what he's actually accomplished in all of those decades in office.

Jeff Stein

He seems not only devoid of ideological commitments but, in the public eye at least, he just seems devoid of personality too. It's rare for a public figure to have such an absence of hobbies or nicknames or anything like that.

How does a guy like that get other Republicans in the Senate to support him for this long? Is there a divide between that bland public image people receive and the person he really is? Or is the understanding of him as someone who is sort of lifeless accurate once you see it closer up?

Alec MacGillis

It's pretty close to the reality of the man. He is said to have a wry, droll, almost English humor in person that does not come through so much in the public persona. But you're right — the fact that someone so colorless could get so far is extraordinary.

He really is kind of the Keyser Söze of the last year or two. All along, he was the guy who made it happen for the Republicans. Very publicly, with the Supreme Court obstructionism, exploding that norm in a way that worked. And we've just learned he was more quietly having vast influence behind the scenes with the Russians and the attempts to keep that hacking private before the election.

That's why, as bland as he is, he's almost so bland it's kind of fascinating. He has people in his own caucus to be loyal to him — his lack of classic leadership traits is compensated for with money. Not only did he raise the money for them, he also led the fight on campaign finance — he took the hits for all the Republicans on that. He was willing to put himself out there as the guy who opposed all of these limits.

It earned him scorn in certain corners, but he could take those shots because he knew it would produce affection for him among other Republicans.

The money thing — it's so telling that the one issue he really cares about and has invested himself in is campaign finance reform. It's the issue that's all about the game. It's a process issue that has everything to do with winning the next election.

Would Mitch McConnell stand up to Donald Trump?

Jeff Stein

I think this is all incredibly useful for a question that — maybe I'm being dramatic here — but that could help determine the stability of the American republic.

It seems absolutely crucial to determine if McConnell will stand up to Trump on anything. Is there anything in McConnell's record that gives you faith in that?

Alec MacGillis

One thing one can say for McConnell, and he's done it again recently, is that when things really head to the brink — things like the debt ceiling crisis, the fiscal cliff, the government shutdown — it was always McConnell at the very end cutting a deal with [Vice President Joe] Biden or whoever to avert the total crisis.

In the end, it was clear he was helping avert disaster. But he was always getting varied appeals from Republicans at those moments. He was using the extremism and nihilism of that wing of the party as a bargaining chip. Saying, ""Hey, Biden or [Sen. Harry] Reid, you want to work with me because these guys could take that over the edge.""

Jeff Stein

Even that can look like a political expedience argument for maintaining power. Today, Ross Douthat at the New York Times had a column trying to place Trump on the x-axis of populism on the one hand and conservatism on the other, and on the y-axis of authoritarianism on one end and chaos on the other. Where do you put McConnell on that grid?

Alec MacGillis

I see McConnell stepping into moments to try to avert the total crisis because there is in him just enough of a conservative instinct that at the end of the day [he] wants to conserve the country. There's maybe just enough of that to help avert the crisis at the last moment. But he will get as much out of it as he can for the party.

The best gauge of what he will do is to ask the question, ""What will he think will most help the party in the next cycle?"" That is how he thinks. That is what it is all about. Whatever his calculus for how they will next perform in 2018 or 2020 — what he needs to do to win those elections — that's what will guide him.

And that's what guided him in the Obama years, and that's what will guide him in the Trump years. His insight was that the way you beat Obama is by grinding things to a halt, which would hurt the Democrats more because they were the party in the White House and the party of government, and because it would undermine Obama's whole comity shtick. Which paid off beyond McConnell's wildest dreams by now electing someone who fed off voter anger with Washington dysfunction.

Jeff Stein

But I think there's something actually comforting there for liberals. If you're a Democrat who is terrified of what Paul Ryan wants to do to the safety net, then maybe there's an opportunity here to exert political pressure he may be genuinely responsive to.

Whereas a McCain figure or even a Ryan figure might be more willing to make sacrifices that could hurt the party's cohesion for the country.

Alec MacGillis

You bring up an important point, which is that it's not just what will increase the chances for the party faring well but also for himself faring well in the next cycle. You can completely see him steering clear of complications with Trump if he worries it will hurt his own reelection in four years.

During Romney's election, for so many other years as leader, McConnell was so closely tending to his own personal prospects. At crucial moments when he as the Republican leader should have been stepping forward to really show the way on substantive issues, he was really just not there.

Has all that expediency, all that work, all this thinking about the election — was it all toward this moment where he finally has control and can do what he wants substantively? Or will it continue to just be about the next cycle to the point where he's reluctant to do what Donald Trump or Paul Ryan wants to do because he fears they will hurt them in the next election?

us_senate,Fox Online News,2,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/01/11/tillerson-to-be-grilled-in-secretary-state-confirmation-hearing.html,Tillerson to be grilled in secretary of state confirmation hearing,2017-01-11,,"Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson and Sen. Marco Rubio clashed during a pair of contentious exchanges Wednesday , with an incredulous Rubio pressing the prospective diplomat to brand Russian President Vladimir Putin a `` war criminal '' and Tillerson coolly blunting Rubio 's broadsides by explaining his more deliberative vision .
During the tense back-and-forths at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee confirmation hearing , Rubio , R-Fla. , cross-examined Tillerson on policy regarding Russia , Cuba , Saudi Arabia and the Philippines . At the end of Rubio 's second questioning period , Tillerson sought to allay any concerns the aggressive Rubio may have had .
`` There seems to be some misunderstanding that I see the world through a different lens , and I do not , '' Tillerson said . `` ... But I 'm also clear-eyed and realistic about dealing with cultures . ''
Tillerson 's statement followed a heated initial session during which the ExxonMobil CEO refused to specifically call Putin a `` war criminal . ''
`` I find it discouraging your ability to cite that , which I think is globally accepted , '' Rubio said .
That exchange mirrored later questions by Rubio , who tried getting Tillerson to categorize Saudi Arabia as a `` human rights violator '' and denounce the practices of controversial Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte .
Tillerson also would n't bite when Rubio , a former opponent of President-elect Donald Trump during the Republican presidential primary , tried to get Tillerson to say Putin murdered political foes .
Still , Tillerson took a noticeably harder line toward Putin and Russia than Trump has done during the transition period and prior to it .
“ Russia today poses a danger , but it is not unpredictable in advancing its own interests , '' Tillerson said during his opening statement . `` ... Our NATO allies are right to be alarmed at a resurgent Russia . ”
Tillerson called Russia an `` unfriendly adversary '' during later testimony , stopping short of saying the nation was an enemy of the U.S .
Russia took center-stage during the early portion of the hearing for Tillerson . Senators grilled Tillerson amid swirling questions about alleged meddling in U.S. politics by the Kremlin and Tillerson ’ s own business ties to Russia .
`` My love of country and my patriotism is going to dictate that I serve no one 's interests but that of the American people , '' Tillerson said .
Tillerson said that Russia had no legal claim to Crimea -- `` that was a taking of territory that was not theirs '' -- and said the Obama administration should have provided Ukraine with help defending its borders .
`` The absence of a very firm , forceful response to the taking of Crimea was judged by leadership in Russia as a weak response , '' Tillerson said .
While Russia dominated the early proceedings , Tillerson also addressed other areas .

One early protester was ejected after she screamed “ I reject you ! ” at Tillerson .","Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson and Sen. Marco Rubio clashed during a pair of contentious exchanges Wednesday, with an incredulous Rubio pressing the prospective diplomat to brand Russian President Vladimir Putin a ""war criminal"" and Tillerson coolly blunting Rubio's broadsides by explaining his more deliberative vision.



During the tense back-and-forths at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee confirmation hearing, Rubio, R-Fla., cross-examined Tillerson on policy regarding Russia, Cuba, Saudi Arabia and the Philippines. At the end of Rubio's second questioning period, Tillerson sought to allay any concerns the aggressive Rubio may have had.



""There seems to be some misunderstanding that I see the world through a different lens, and I do not,"" Tillerson said. ""...But I'm also clear-eyed and realistic about dealing with cultures.""

Tillerson's statement followed a heated initial session during which the ExxonMobil CEO refused to specifically call Putin a ""war criminal.""

""I find it discouraging your ability to cite that, which I think is globally accepted,"" Rubio said.

That exchange mirrored later questions by Rubio, who tried getting Tillerson to categorize Saudi Arabia as a ""human rights violator"" and denounce the practices of controversial Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte.

Tillerson also wouldn't bite when Rubio, a former opponent of President-elect Donald Trump during the Republican presidential primary, tried to get Tillerson to say Putin murdered political foes.

Still, Tillerson took a noticeably harder line toward Putin and Russia than Trump has done during the transition period and prior to it.

“Russia today poses a danger, but it is not unpredictable in advancing its own interests,"" Tillerson said during his opening statement. ""...Our NATO allies are right to be alarmed at a resurgent Russia.”

Tillerson called Russia an ""unfriendly adversary"" during later testimony, stopping short of saying the nation was an enemy of the U.S.

Russia took center-stage during the early portion of the hearing for Tillerson. Senators grilled Tillerson amid swirling questions about alleged meddling in U.S. politics by the Kremlin and Tillerson’s own business ties to Russia.

""My love of country and my patriotism is going to dictate that I serve no one's interests but that of the American people,"" Tillerson said.

Tillerson said that Russia had no legal claim to Crimea -- ""that was a taking of territory that was not theirs"" -- and said the Obama administration should have provided Ukraine with help defending its borders.

""The absence of a very firm, forceful response to the taking of Crimea was judged by leadership in Russia as a weak response,"" Tillerson said.

While Russia dominated the early proceedings, Tillerson also addressed other areas.

He took aim at China’s “illegal” building of man-made islands in the South China Sea and radical Islam, which he said posed “a grave risk to the stability of nations and the well-being of their citizens.”

On Syria, Tillerson said the U.S. currently had too many competing goals and needed to focus on defeating ISIS before a discussion could occur about who should lead the country. The Obama administration's dual priorities of ousting President Bashar al-Assad and eradicating ISIS were sometimes at odds with each other, Tillerson said.

Tillerson called ISIS an imminent threat but named cyber intrusions as the ""greatest and most complex threat"" facing the U.S.

He also said the American government had “stumbled” under the Obama administration.

“If we do not lead, we risk plunging the world deeper into confusion and danger,” Tillerson said.

One moment of levity occurred when Sen. Tim Kaine asked Tillerson about ExxonMobile's climate change policies. Tillerson told Kaine that Kaine would need to ask current executives, to which Kaine asked if Tillerson lacked ""the knowledge to answer my question or are you refusing to answer my question?""

""A little of both,"" Tillerson said to laughs.

On the topic of Trump's frequent use of Twitter, Tillerson said he wouldn't ""tell the boss how to communicate with the American people. That's gonna be his choice.""

Tillerson testified a day after a contentious Senate session involving Attorney General nominee Sen. Jeff Sessions.

BACKLASH FEARED

Killing the Affordable Care Act, Democratic former President Barack Obama’s signature domestic policy achievement dubbed Obamacare, has been a passion for Republicans since its 2010 enactment over their unified opposition, and was a key campaign promise by Trump last year.

Republicans lawmakers, some of whom have been gleeful about razing Obama’s presidential legacy, now fear a backlash from their conservative political base that could affect the 2018 congressional elections.

This leaves health insurers unsure of how long the administration will continue to make billions of dollars in Obamacare payments that help cover out-of-pocket medical expenses for low-income Americans.

Schumer warned against any efforts to sabotage the law.

The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, which represents insurers across the country, said it would work to ensure a smooth open enrollment period from Nov. 1-Dec. 15 and stabilize the individual insurance market under Obamacare for the long term.

Shares of health insurers, which had fought against the bill’s proposed repeal of the mandate that Americans obtain insurance, were up. Aetna Inc rose 0.9 percent, Anthem Inc gained 2.3 percent and Humana Inc edged up 0.2 percent.

EXCLUDING DEMOCRATS

By including an effective repeal of Obamacare’s individual mandate, Senate Republicans likely ended any possibility of gaining support from Democrats.

“This is not just another garden variety attack on the Affordable Care Act, or ACA. This is repeal of that law,” said Senator Ron Wyden, the finance committee’s top Democrat. He blasted Republicans for setting a “double standard” by guaranteeing permanent tax cuts only for corporations.

The individual mandate clause of Obamacare requires healthy younger people to buy insurance or pay a federal penalty. The aim is to hold down coverage costs for those sick or older.

By repealing that penalty, Republicans would raise more than $318 billion over a decade to pay for tax cuts, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan unit of Congress.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office separately estimated last week that repealing the mandate would increase the number of uninsured Americans by 13 million by 2027.

Trump backed the inclusion of the mandate repeal in the tax bill, as do Republican conservatives in the Senate and House.

When I heard late last week that Tennessee Sen.

The former boxer’s ability to absorb blows and, even more importantly, to counterpunch, perhaps with an occasional hit below the belt, are the secrets of his longevity—and no doubt he will deploy them once again as the Senate fights this week over the budget deal. Unlike most of the preening Club of 100, Reid expends little effort tending to his public image. Driving home messages (the Tea Party is destructive) and advancing legislation (the nuclear option) are what energize this tireless son of Searchlight, Nev., a speck of a town outside Las Vegas where Reid’s hardscrabble childhood helped produce a man impervious to most political considerations and virtually immune to criticism.

The majority leader is a mélange of contradictions—a Machiavelli with malaprops (otherwise known as Reidisms)—but you can’t understand them just from the vantage point of the theater up on Capitol Hill. I’ve seen them revealed over a quarter century of close observation back in Nevada, where Reid, 74, has always been both a study in outperforming expectations and a political fighter with bare-knuckles ambition. Many still puzzle over this—how Reid can be at once a seemingly soulless manipulator of the process while occasionally revealing deeply held beliefs; a religious man proud of his Mormon faith who has metamorphosed into a social progressive; and an outwardly meek, bland figure whose cutthroat ways make him easily the most feared man in Nevada by politicians of both parties.

But Reid being Reid is inevitably on display when he comes back home. Consider his news-making tour of the state a few days ago, during which he managed to crassly describe Lucy Flores, an assemblywoman he hopes to install as the Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor, as “demographically… perfect.

To truly understand Reid, you have to go back to the beginning. To 1986. When Jim Santini launched his candidacy for the U.S. Senate that year, he could not have expected what would happen at his opening news conference.

A reporter had somehow gotten access to documents from an old, unresolved Federal Election Commission case and peppered the former congressman with questions about it. Santini, known to perspire, began sweating profusely.

That was the image Harry Reid, then an ambitious two-term congressman, and his campaign team were looking for—and they would go on to use the video from that press conference over and over during the campaign in a series of ads about the Democrat-turned-Republican with the tagline: “Which Jim Santini do you believe?”

The reporter who asked the questions had been fed the information by a former colleague who left journalism to work for Reid’s campaign. It was brutal and effective; it was consummate Harry Reid.

I began covering Nevada politics for the Las Vegas Review-Journal shortly after that news conference. I was in my mid-20s and had been in Nevada for two years covering cops and county government. When another reporter left the paper abruptly, I was thrown into the hurly-burly of a nationally watched Senate race between Reid, then 46, and Santini, who had been persuaded by retiring Republican Sen. Paul Laxalt to switch parties and run as a Republican for his vacant seat.

“ If I had an eye problem , I would go to him . If I had a constitutional question , he would be the last guy I would pick , ” Graham said on Thursday when asked about Paul , who is an ophthalmologist .

Kaine , Lee : 'We should not be at war with Iran unless Congress authorizes it ' Overnight Defense : War powers fight runs into impeachment | Kaine has 51 votes for Iran resolution | Trump plans to divert .2B from Pentagon to border wall MORE ( R-Utah ) emerged from Wednesday ’ s classified briefing deeply critical of what they characterized as a warning from senior administration officials against debating Trump ’ s war authority and their use of a 2002 authorization as the basis for last week ’ s drone strike in Baghdad that killed Soleimani .
Appearing together before a gaggle of reporters and TV cameras , Lee called the presentation “ the worst briefing I 've seen , at least on a military issue . ''
Paul added that he found the briefing `` less than satisfying '' and that it was “ absurd ” and “ insane ” to use the 2002 Iraq war authorization as the basis for an air strike against an Iranian general .
`` I see no way in the world you could logically argue that an authorization to have war with Saddam Hussein has anything to with having war with people currently in Iraq , '' Paul told reporters .
The anti-intervention stance aligns Paul and Lee with Trump ’ s 2016 campaign , when he consistently struck an isolationist tone and pledged to end the country ’ s “ forever ” wars .
But Paul and Lee are now at odds with most of their GOP colleagues on matters of military authority , making them outliers in the caucus . Most Senate Republicans hold views in line with the party ’ s foreign policy establishment , and Graham has in many ways taken over the mantle of top hawk following the death of Sen. John McCain John Sidney McCainMartha McSally fundraises off 'liberal hack ' remark to CNN reporter Meghan McCain blasts NY Times : 'Everyone already knows how much you despise ' conservative women GOP senator calls CNN reporter a 'liberal hack ' when asked about Parnas materials MORE ( R-Ariz. ) .
Graham fired the opening shot Wednesday when he said he thought Paul and Lee were “ overreacting ” with their criticism of the administration 's stance on the war powers debate .
“ I 'm going to let people know that at this moment in time to play this game with the War Powers Act ... whether you mean to or not , you 're empowering the enemy , ” Graham told reporters .
That prompted Paul , during a CNN interview , to argue that Graham hasn ’ t “ even read the history of the Constitution . ”
`` He insults the Constitution , our Founding Fathers and what we do stand for in this republic by making light of it and accusing people of lacking patriotism . I think that 's a low , gutter type of response , '' Paul said .
Paul has taken issue with Graham ’ s argument that Congress ’ s only way to rein in a president ’ s war powers is to defund the military conflict . Over the years , Paul has tried several times to sunset both the 2001 and 2002 authorizations for the use of military force .
It ’ s hardly the first time Paul and Graham have clashed .
In 2015 , a clip of Graham went viral after he rolled his eyes at Paul on the Senate floor as the Kentucky Republican spoke during a debate over the Patriot Act . Paul , who was running for president at the time , fired off a fundraising email that labeled Graham and other surveillance-minded senators as `` members of the 'eye roll ' caucus . ”
Two years later , Paul called Graham a “ warmonger ” because the South Carolina senator couldn ’ t remember how many U.S. troops there were around the world .
The two also routinely battle over the annual defense policy bill because Graham opposes Paul ’ s amendment related to indefinite detention .
“ This is not about me . This is about one senator from South Carolina who so much objects to the Bill of Rights that he doesn ’ t want it to apply to people accused of a crime , ” Paul said in 2018 as their fight held up the defense bill .
But there are signs that both camps are trying to paper over the rift that opened up this week .
Lee appeared to soften his criticism slightly , telling Breitbart , a conservative publication popular with Trump ’ s base , that the worst briefing he ever attended was during the Obama administration . Lee had specified Wednesday that the Iran briefing was the worst on military issues .
“ The worst briefing I ever got in that room was on a slightly different issue back in 2012 right after the Benghazi attack , where we were told repeatedly by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonFormer Vermont Governor : Sanders 'will play dirty ' NYT : Justice investigating alleged Comey leak of years-old classified info New Hampshire state lawmaker switches support from Warren to Klobuchar MORE that the attack on the Benghazi consulate was based on a reaction to a video . So , fortunately , this was not that , ” Lee said .
Graham also referred to Paul and Lee as “ patriots ” before stressing that he thinks they are on the wrong side of the war powers fight .
“ What I ’ ve been trying to convince Sen. Paul of , and I have failed miserably , is there is a delicate balance in the Constitution , ” Graham said . “ The constitutional founders never envisioned 535 commenders in chiefs . The ability to direct military forces is in the hands of the president of the United States . ”","A high-profile debate over President Trump Donald John TrumpLev Parnas implicates Rick Perry, says Giuliani had him pressure Ukraine to announce Biden probe Saudi Arabia paid 0 million for cost of US troops in area Parnas claims ex-Trump attorney visited him in jail, asked him to sacrifice himself for president MORE’s war powers is fueling a feud among Senate Republicans.

Appearing together before a gaggle of reporters and TV cameras, Lee called the presentation “the worst briefing I've seen, at least on a military issue.""

Paul added that he found the briefing ""less than satisfying"" and that it was “absurd” and “insane” to use the 2002 Iraq war authorization as the basis for an air strike against an Iranian general.

""I see no way in the world you could logically argue that an authorization to have war with Saddam Hussein has anything to with having war with people currently in Iraq,"" Paul told reporters.

The anti-intervention stance aligns Paul and Lee with Trump’s 2016 campaign, when he consistently struck an isolationist tone and pledged to end the country’s “forever” wars.

But Paul and Lee are now at odds with most of their GOP colleagues on matters of military authority, making them outliers in the caucus. Most Senate Republicans hold views in line with the party’s foreign policy establishment, and Graham has in many ways taken over the mantle of top hawk following the death of Sen.

Graham fired the opening shot Wednesday when he said he thought Paul and Lee were “overreacting” with their criticism of the administration's stance on the war powers debate.

“I'm going to let people know that at this moment in time to play this game with the War Powers Act ... whether you mean to or not, you're empowering the enemy,” Graham told reporters.

That prompted Paul, during a CNN interview, to argue that Graham hasn’t “even read the history of the Constitution.”

""He insults the Constitution, our Founding Fathers and what we do stand for in this republic by making light of it and accusing people of lacking patriotism. I think that's a low, gutter type of response,"" Paul said.

Paul has taken issue with Graham’s argument that Congress’s only way to rein in a president’s war powers is to defund the military conflict. Over the years, Paul has tried several times to sunset both the 2001 and 2002 authorizations for the use of military force.

It’s hardly the first time Paul and Graham have clashed.

In 2015, a clip of Graham went viral after he rolled his eyes at Paul on the Senate floor as the Kentucky Republican spoke during a debate over the Patriot Act. Paul, who was running for president at the time, fired off a fundraising email that labeled Graham and other surveillance-minded senators as ""members of the 'eye roll' caucus.”

Two years later, Paul called Graham a “warmonger” because the South Carolina senator couldn’t remember how many U.S. troops there were around the world.

The two also routinely battle over the annual defense policy bill because Graham opposes Paul’s amendment related to indefinite detention.

“This is not about me. This is about one senator from South Carolina who so much objects to the Bill of Rights that he doesn’t want it to apply to people accused of a crime,” Paul said in 2018 as their fight held up the defense bill.

But there are signs that both camps are trying to paper over the rift that opened up this week.

Lee appeared to soften his criticism slightly, telling Breitbart, a conservative publication popular with Trump’s base, that the worst briefing he ever attended was during the Obama administration. Lee had specified Wednesday that the Iran briefing was the worst on military issues.

“The worst briefing I ever got in that room was on a slightly different issue back in 2012 right after the Benghazi attack, where we were told repeatedly by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonFormer Vermont Governor: Sanders 'will play dirty' NYT: Justice investigating alleged Comey leak of years-old classified info New Hampshire state lawmaker switches support from Warren to Klobuchar MORE that the attack on the Benghazi consulate was based on a reaction to a video. So, fortunately, this was not that,” Lee said.

Graham also referred to Paul and Lee as “patriots” before stressing that he thinks they are on the wrong side of the war powers fight.

“What I’ve been trying to convince Sen. Paul of, and I have failed miserably, is there is a delicate balance in the Constitution,” Graham said. “The constitutional founders never envisioned 535 commenders in chiefs. The ability to direct military forces is in the hands of the president of the United States.”",www.thehill.com,center,UwxJ6W9FNArXU1Qb

Two-time Democratic presidential hopeful John Edwards took responsibility for `` my sins , '' including an affair that resulted in a `` precious '' daughter , after his federal corruption case ended in an acquittal and mistrial Thursday .

On Saturday , House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi announced she planned to file a Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) request to obtain documents related to the FBI 's supplemental probe of Kavanaugh , which senators said showed no corroboration of the decades-old sexual misconduct allegations against him . FBI background checks on judicial nominees have traditionally been kept confidential so that only senators , White House officials , and certain aides can view them .
“ In purposefully limiting the FBI investigation , it is clear the Republicans were not seeking the truth , ” Pelosi , D-Calif. , wrote in a statement . “ They were seeking cover to do what they wanted to do anyway . To add insult to injury , they blocked the public ’ s access to the report . ”
Pelosi also requested any communications from Senate Republicans to the FBI concerning the scope of the investigation . Congress is legally exempt from FOIA requirements , and it was not immediately clear to what extent the FBI would respond to Pelosi 's request .
READ THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF THE SECRET FBI REPORT ON KAVANAUGH : WHAT WITNESSES WERE INTERVIEWED ?
Meanwhile , an online petition to impeach Kavanaugh reached more than 125,000 signatures in wake of Kavanaugh 's confirmation . The petition claims as grounds for impeachment , among other grievances , that Kavanaugh lied under oath about not having `` legacy '' connections to Yale Law School because his grandfather attended Yale as an undergraduate .
However , Yale Law School admissions officials have said that Kavanaugh would have received no boost from his grandfather 's attendance at the university as an undergraduate .
SWING-VOTE SENATORS FACE MASSIVE BACKLASH OVER KAVANAUGH VOTES : TRUMP SAYS MURKOWSKI 'WILL NEVER RECOVER '
The petition also accuses Kavanaugh of lying under oath about when he learned of Deborah Ramirez 's uncorroborated allegation that he exposed himself to her at a college party . Kavanaugh testified that he had heard generally that Ramirez was asking former classmates over the summer about the party to try to find someone to support her story ; his denial appeared in The New Yorker 's piece describing her allegations .
`` There is no room for an accused sexual predator and liar on the Supreme Court , '' the petition , organized by the progressive CREDO Action group , continues . `` Brett Kavanaugh faces credible accusations of sexual assault and perjury and should be impeached . Initiate impeachment proceedings to remove him from the federal bench . ''
Republicans had warned in recent days that liberal groups would rachet up their impeachment rhetoric . `` You better believe that Democrats are going to do everything in their power to impeach Kavanuagh from the Supreme Court if they take control of Congress in November , '' Donald Trump Jr. wrote on Twitter Friday .
Alan Dershowitz , an emeritus Harvard Law School professor , told Fox News that it would be more appropriate for the Department of Justice , not Congress , to probe any viable legal violations by Kavanaugh . Partisan impeachment proceedings , he said , `` would really undercut the process of confirmation and introduce a new level of McCarthyism into the process . ''
Nevertheless , Democratic politicians have seemingly embraced calls to continue to go after Kavanaugh . Rep.

“ The Senate having failed to do its proper constitutionally mandated job of advise and consent -- we are going to have to do something to provide a check and balance , to protect the rule of law and to protect the legitimacy of one of our most important institutions , ” Nadler told The New York Times on Friday .

Voters appeared particularly energized in Missouri , which Fox News polls show is tied up at 43 percent apiece for incumbent Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill and Republican challenger Josh Hawley . Just three weeks ago , McCaskill was up 44-41 percent . Even before Ford testified against Kavanaugh , McCaskill announced that she would not support the nominee .
That decision seems to be costing McCaskill some key support . Crucially , according to Fox News polling , among the 28 percent of voters who say they could still switch candidates , almost twice as many say McCaskill voting against Kavanaugh ’ s confirmation would make them less inclined to back her .
North Dakota shows an even clearer picture . Vulnerable North Dakota Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp , who remains undecided on Kavanaugh , appeared to be treading carefully after McCaskill 's loss of support .

Last month , he was up by only 4 points .","Before and immediately after the Senate narrowly voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court on Saturday, top Democrats vowed that they would continue to fight -- not only at the ballot box in November's midterm elections, but also through further investigations and potentially even impeachment proceedings afterwards.

On Saturday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi announced she planned to file a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to obtain documents related to the FBI's supplemental probe of Kavanaugh, which senators said showed no corroboration of the decades-old sexual misconduct allegations against him. FBI background checks on judicial nominees have traditionally been kept confidential so that only senators, White House officials, and certain aides can view them.

“In purposefully limiting the FBI investigation, it is clear the Republicans were not seeking the truth,” Pelosi, D-Calif., wrote in a statement. “They were seeking cover to do what they wanted to do anyway. To add insult to injury, they blocked the public’s access to the report.”

Pelosi also requested any communications from Senate Republicans to the FBI concerning the scope of the investigation. Congress is legally exempt from FOIA requirements, and it was not immediately clear to what extent the FBI would respond to Pelosi's request.

Meanwhile, an online petition to impeach Kavanaugh reached more than 125,000 signatures in wake of Kavanaugh's confirmation. The petition claims as grounds for impeachment, among other grievances, that Kavanaugh lied under oath about not having ""legacy"" connections to Yale Law School because his grandfather attended Yale as an undergraduate.

However, Yale Law School admissions officials have said that Kavanaugh would have received no boost from his grandfather's attendance at the university as an undergraduate.

The petition also accuses Kavanaugh of lying under oath about when he learned of Deborah Ramirez's uncorroborated allegation that he exposed himself to her at a college party. Kavanaugh testified that he had heard generally that Ramirez was asking former classmates over the summer about the party to try to find someone to support her story; his denial appeared in The New Yorker's piece describing her allegations.

""There is no room for an accused sexual predator and liar on the Supreme Court,"" the petition, organized by the progressive CREDO Action group, continues. ""Brett Kavanaugh faces credible accusations of sexual assault and perjury and should be impeached. Initiate impeachment proceedings to remove him from the federal bench.""

Republicans had warned in recent days that liberal groups would rachet up their impeachment rhetoric. ""You better believe that Democrats are going to do everything in their power to impeach Kavanuagh from the Supreme Court if they take control of Congress in November,"" Donald Trump Jr. wrote on Twitter Friday.

Alan Dershowitz, an emeritus Harvard Law School professor, told Fox News that it would be more appropriate for the Department of Justice, not Congress, to probe any viable legal violations by Kavanaugh. Partisan impeachment proceedings, he said, ""would really undercut the process of confirmation and introduce a new level of McCarthyism into the process.""

Nevertheless, Democratic politicians have seemingly embraced calls to continue to go after Kavanaugh. Rep.

Mccarthy, Carrie Severino, Tobias Hoonhout, Rich Lowry","On the 50th anniversary of his being shot down over Hanoi
In early 1982 , one of my several housemates at the time informed me that he would be leaving our place in Tempe , Ariz. , and moving into a spare room in the home of a newly married couple nearby , the husband a former POW and all-but-announced candidate for Congress . My friend had been hired as the aspiring congressman ’ s very first full-time political aide . And , as soon as he had settled in , he wanted to introduce his new employer to me and a few others we knew from Arizona State University . Would I like to come by and meet John McCain ?
If I ’ d had any clue then what a noted figure the man would become in political history — allowing me , far into the future , a minor part in his presidential campaign — I would have paid closer attention when the day came and we all sat down to chat in his living room on Lamplighter Street . My memory of the visit is a little sketchy now , although I do recall noticing , back when people still remarked on them , the prematurely white hair and constricted arm movements , both features courtesy of McCain ’ s captors in North Vietnam .
John and Cindy hadn ’ t lived in their house very long ; moving boxes were still in sight , and the furniture had a fresh-from-the-showroom feel . Representative John Rhodes , the district ’ s venerable voice in Congress , had a few weeks earlier signaled his retirement , and no piece of Tempe real estate ever moved faster than this place the McCains had just bought , relocating to CD-1 from Phoenix , a 15-minute drive away .
The absurd backstory is that the two or three of us invited there were C. S. Lewis enthusiasts , in a small group at ASU , eight students at most , named for the day of our weekly discussions of the Oxford don ’ s wisdom — “ The Tuesday Club. ” Hoping to show he had useful connections , my ex-housemate had apparently been vague about our size and mission , leaving McCain to imagine he was doing business with the delegation of an influential college organization , some key piece of the district puzzle he could grab early on .
I figured out the situation only when , wrapping things up , McCain turned to me with an earnest pitch : “ So , if I get into this race , I ’ d be honored if I could count on the support of the Tuesday Club. ” My friends and I nodded assurances — yes , we would certainly consider it — finished off a tray of treats Cindy had brought out , and departed leaving no suspicion that the candidate-to-be had just thrown away an afternoon .
Today ’ s storied “ maverick ” of the Senate was back then a regular sight around ASU , addressing ROTC and other student groups , pressing campaign buttons on passersby in the Sun Devil Stadium parking lot , finding the people with actual influence in the district , and with a stamina and personal story impossible to match making himself , by 1986 , the obvious successor to Barry Goldwater .
From there it was on to all his years as a presence in national politics , although my own next brush with his career came in 2000 as a speechwriter in the campaign of George W. Bush . And , I admit , I didn ’ t mind at all that some Republican voters that year didn ’ t care for the senator , regarding him as a media pet and creature of Washington .
Happily , his second chance in 2008 would bring one for me , too . I didn ’ t really know anyone on his team but made it my business to meet them , and from late March until Election Day I got my best look at John McCain in action , as America did as well . I wasn ’ t anything like a close adviser , just a late-arriving addition to the staff , scarcely remembered by the candidate from our Tempe encounters in the ’ 80s .
All the more in retrospect , what became the McCain-Palin enterprise was a great experience , leading to a loss that , on a résumé , I wouldn ’ t trade for other people ’ s victories . And before I got there , of course , the most improbable part of the effort had already unfolded — the “ McCain Miracle . ”
Reporters have lately been recalling the story with admiration , though at the time a charitable word for the candidate was hard to come by . In the months before the primaries , he had been written off , the quotable , ever-accessible straight talker of 2000 who had lost his charm , mostly because the situation in the Iraq war was desperate , he was associated with it , and he would not equivocate . His campaign was a wreck , his consultants had scattered , he was flying commercial and unaccompanied to New Hampshire . Continuing news coverage was termed a “ death watch . ”
‘ We ’ re at 3 percent and the poll has a 5 percent margin of error , ’ went John McCain ’ s stock line early in the 2008 campaign — along with that other old favorite : ‘ In the words of Chairman Mao , “ It ’ s always darkest before it ’ s totally black . ” ’
Veterans of the 1996 presidential contest could remember a vanishing of prominent friends and supporters as November neared , leaving Bob Dole in the last hours to face his fate practically alone on the stage except for the senator from Arizona . That was the shape of McCain ’ s own quest by late 2007 . “ We ’ re at 3 percent and the poll has a 5 percent margin of error , ” went his stock line at the time — along with that other old favorite : “ In the words of Chairman Mao , ‘ It ’ s always darkest before it ’ s totally black . ’ ”
He refused to quit and , above all , he would not abandon the cause in Iraq , saying — in surely the most enduring words of any 2008 candidate — “ I would rather lose an election than see my country lose a war . ”
He had been getting a dose of the same sort of counsel President Bush was hearing about the troop surge in Iraq : pointless , over , done , get out . Unlike so many others who had cast their votes to authorize that war , however , this senator had thought through the consequences before deciding , aware that enormous difficulties might come and that perseverance would be needed . He wouldn ’ t hedge . Tying his own fortunes to those of our troops , in what looked to some 70 percent of Americans like a futile effort , he was at that moment , as ███ editor Rich Lowry observed , “ the very picture of courageous political leadership . ”
I have never understood the contempt that some conservatives direct at the senator for McCain-Feingold , the old Gang of 8 , or other matters on which he has by now , at the very least , earned the presumption of upright intention . He did not in early 2008 , in any case , look like a man of the establishment . And , never mind the success of the surge in Iraq , his reward for grit was to hear himself , as the New Hampshire winner and eventual nominee , accused of wanting “ a hundred-year war , ” a phrase endlessly repeated by Barack Obama .
As if our candidate , with a son in Iraq at the time , really needed reminding of the cost and risk of a military commitment . Even more galling , later in 2008 , was the impression put about by the Obama campaign and obliging reporters that the then-71-year-old senator was a little , you know , “ erratic. ” “ Unsteady ” and so oddly “ angry , ” too ( who really knew what damage all that torture and solitary confinement had left ? ) . It was an especially shabby touch , given McCain ’ s steadfastness on by far the hardest and most crucial security issue of that election year . And we now know that “ unsteady ” far better describes the presidential judgment that would later squander the gains of the surge to invite a wider conflict and tragedies worse than before — again , despite the warnings of Senator McCain .
Acknowledging his opponent ’ s military record , Obama always used the same formulation — “ Of course , John McCain is an American hero , but . . . Now , John McCain is an American hero , but . . . ” — as if by repetition to make it seem obligatory and trite . No faulting him for that — the last thing the Obama campaign needed was thoughtful attention to what exactly their opponent ’ s heroism had entailed . How else , as a rival for high office , are you going to deal with a guy who spent five and a half years in extreme pain , privation , and loneliness in the hands of the enemy , at any moment of which he could have gone home by simply agreeing to be released out of turn ?
One would think that , having made his acquaintance long before , I would by 2008 already have troubled myself to read Faith of My Fathers , McCain ’ s definitive telling of the prisoner-of-war experience , timed to introduce himself as a national contender in 2000 . In truth , I didn ’ t get around to it until , as a McCain-Palin speechwriter , I had a practical reason for doing so . One of the senator ’ s many close collaborations with my 2008 colleague , the masterful Mark Salter , the book is a work of enduring beauty , a devotional to country that you ’ ll never forget , and I remember thinking , if we didn ’ t make it that year , what a loss to presidential literature .
Though to his credit McCain never let himself become a “ professional POW , ” forever trading on that identity , of course it ’ s everything , a long-ago passage through the underside of life that made him who he is . Just a few weeks ago , in a 60 Minutes interview , he called his bonds with fellow POWs “ the joy of my life. ” Here ’ s a passage that explains why , describing an exchange , in taps on the wall , with a man in the next cell named Bob Craner :
He was a remarkably composed man with the courage to accept any fate with great dignity . There were times when I would start to lose my nerve . I would detect some sign that another camp purge was coming , and my dread of another beating would start to get the better of my self-control . Anticipating a beating could prove more unnerving than the beating itself . “ Bob , I think it ’ s coming again , and I don ’ t think they ’ ll miss us. ” “ If it comes , it comes , ” he counseled me . “ If it doesn ’ t , it doesn ’ t , and there isn ’ t a damn thing we can do about it. ” It may strike others as odd that such fatalism could have comforted us , but it did . It was the best attitude you could hold under the circumstances . It steeled me when I was weak , and made me feel better about myself . Worrying about a beating was pointless . There wasn ’ t much I could do to prevent it , save disgrace myself , and disgrace hurt more than the worst beating .
You don ’ t get many points in politics anymore for modesty , understatement , or manful reserve , and the book in that way , like McCain ’ s Senate speeches , echoes a different era . There is not one false note or pretentious touch . There ’ s a wisdom , nobility , and self-knowledge beyond anything that politics has to teach . There are stories , too , that in both of his presidential campaigns should have spoken to the hearts of religious-conservative voters – who for reasons of their own never quite took to McCain – in ways far more important than a candidate ’ s standing at Bob Jones University , or his failure to grovel before this or that group .
Most impressive of all , McCain in the truly stirring parts of Faith of My Fathers extols the examples of other prisoners . ( You have to hear their own accounts , as I have in person , to learn how much those fellow captives admired and counted on him . ) In one well-known scene , later included in a movie , McCain recalls seeing a young sailor named Mike Christian fashioning an American flag from scraps of cloth , having just received merciless punishment for the same offense :
With his eyes nearly swollen shut from the beating , he had quietly picked up his needle and thread and begun sewing a new flag . I witnessed many acts of heroism in prison , but none braver than that . As I watched him , I felt a surge of pride at serving with him , and an equal measure of humility for lacking that extra ration of courage that distinguished Mike Christian from other men .
“ Old news , ” as many voters dismissed reminders of our candidate ’ s service . Not enough of them rated his life experiences “ relevant to people like me , ” as the pollsters put it . And so in November 2008 we ended up with the author of Dreams from My Father , a self-involved narrative with made-up characters , and not the author of Faith of My Fathers , the story of actual men who served and suffered for their country .
This was not , after all , some flash of glory in combat but the prolonged endurance of fear , despair , humiliation , brokenness , and the overcoming of evil by love and solidarity . When all that won ’ t cut it for people craving an “ inspirational ” figure , it is not the candidate who ’ s missing something .
We were spared a What Happened–type meditation after 2008 , an agonizing over all of the loser ’ s bad breaks , but none was needed anyway . What happened was that when the market began to collapse in mid September , the good judgment of millions of voters went with it . Nor has the national political press corps ever been more hopelessly in the thrall of one candidate than it was that year , forgetting any respectable standard of journalism .
So often in politics we hear ringing or tough words offered as strength that are really , to borrow a phrase from Eric Hoffer , just ‘ the weak man ’ s imitation of strength . ’
Not even its partiality to Hillary Clinton in 2016 , fear-driven , came anywhere near the obsequious pampering accorded to Obama , lest any disclosure , misstep , or hint of criticism be allowed to threaten his historic ascent . In a debate with McCain , Obama shared a moving autobiographical story of his own about how the health-care issue was “ personal to me , ” and stopped telling the story only when the election was safely behind him and some reporter with time on his hands finally bothered to look into it , establishing that no such thing had ever happened . Obama casually broke a repeated pledge to accept public financing in the general election ( while McCain kept his word ) , but who cared , or even presumed to solicit an explanation ?
I used to say in that campaign that Team Obama was obviously very sharp and talented but that it must be nice to wake up every morning with half your work already done for you by the media . It fell to an editor at Politico to finally say outright what everyone knew : “ In the closing weeks of this election , John McCain and Sarah Palin are getting hosed in the press . ”
Palin , of course , was her own story , highlighted by the panic she caused to Democrats with her sparkling debut , within days turning a deficit of 6.4 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics polling average into a lead of 2.4 . President Bush is said to have remarked , after her morale-boosting arrival on the scene , “ That little lady has no idea what ’ s about to come her way , ” and we all soon learned in the media savaging that followed .
A lesser man , when things got rough for his running mate , might have directed his frustration outward . Instead , as I saw a few times myself , he had only encouragement and kindness to offer , accepting the responsibility as his own . “ On the upswing and the down , ” as the authors of Game Change put it , “ through the nastiest moments . . . , not an ill word escaped his lips about Palin . . . . . He treated Palin chivalrously , inquiring regularly about her well-being and that of her family . We asked a lot of her , McCain said , and he meant it . ”
To complete the picture in 2008 , we needed only the accusations of racial animus , provided as usual by the tiresome Georgia congressman John Lewis . Weeks before the Election Day , he warned that McCain was “ sowing the seeds of hatred and division , ” in such a “ vicious ” manner that it reminded Lewis , as every Republican nominee does sooner or later , of George Wallace . This from a decades-long “ friend ” of McCain ’ s who knew much better , libeling a candidate who had declined to exploit — to note but one example — the pastoral exhortations of Obama ’ s outlandish spiritual guide , saying simply of Rev . Wright : “ I think that when people support you , it doesn ’ t mean that you support everything they say . Obviously , those words and those statements are statements that none of us would associate ourselves with , and I don ’ t believe that Senator Obama would support any of those , as well . ”
It was a point of honor that I doubt would have restrained the Obama campaign in any comparable circumstances , and there were other such moments . If you ’ re feeling nostalgic sometime , have a look at videos from the fall of that year showing McCain at a town hall repeatedly calming and correcting people who called his opponent dangerous , or “ an Arab , ” or someone to be “ scared of ” : “ No , ma ’ am . He ’ s a decent family man [ and ] citizen that I just happen to have disagreements with . . . . I have to tell you , Senator Obama is a decent person and a person you don ’ t have to be scared of as president of the United States . . . . We want to fight , and I will fight . But I will be respectful . ”
And so on , these and similar answers actually earning him jeers and a shout of “ Liar ! ” from the crowd . As in his bearing in delivering the concession speech ( “ And though we fell short , the failure is mine , not yours ” ) , or setting the gold standard of grace at the Alfred E. Smith Dinner in the closing days , it was our ’ 08 standard-bearer in form , his own man , refusing to play to the crowd , and handling himself with more class on the way to a bitter defeat than many others have managed on the way to victory .
So often in politics we hear ringing or tough words offered as strength that are really , to borrow a phrase from Eric Hoffer , just “ the weak man ’ s imitation of strength. ” A lot depends on enough voters ’ discerning the difference , and the 2008 verdict , for all of the winner ’ s own finer points , was a big miss . For our part in that campaign , we owe the also-ran the wonderful recollection of working for someone who merited our affection and also commanded our complete respect . I have never cast a vote for president with greater confidence in the worthiness of a candidate , nor felt so fortunate to have shared in failure . As Charles Krauthammer reflected at the time , “ McCain ran a valiant race against impossible odds . He will be — he should be — remembered as the most worthy presidential nominee ever to be denied the prize . ”
Not one to let disappointment linger , McCain long ago moved on . He continues as our stoical , self-deprecating , “ imperfect servant , ” insisting on bygone customs such as “ regular order ” in the Senate , wondering why debates in Congress can not more often be “ an argument among friends , ” reminding us of “ causes greater than self-interest , ” attending to security threats others notice only in crises — and in general , whatever the rough edges , acting and speaking the way mature men and women were once expected to in conducting the affairs of their country .
When he wasn ’ t giving that suspenseful thumbs-down to the last-ditch Obamacare repeal last month , indifferent to pressure one way or the other , you could find him on Face the Nation discoursing on military readiness , guiding Senate approval of the Defense Reauthorization Act , chairing an Armed Services Committee hearing on the recent fatal collisions of four naval ships , and personally calling each of the families of the ten sailors lost on one of those ships — the USS John S. McCain , named for both his father and grandfather . I happened to catch a C-SPAN clip of that hearing , after which the senator could be seen comforting the families in attendance , at one point holding the father of a sailor killed on the USS Fitzgerald in a long , sorrowful embrace .
Always onward — so relentlessly that we could be excused for at times forgetting his own most recent misfortune . The subject of the cancer comes up with interviewers , and they get spare replies along the lines of what he told CNN ’ s Jake Tapper , who inquired about his prospects : “ Every life has to end one way or another. ” He ’ s giving it his all , while trying to be “ joyful. ” After all he ’ s had “ a wonderful life , and I will be grateful for additional time that I have. ” How , Tapper wondered , would McCain wish to be remembered ? “ He served his country . And not always right , made a lot of mistakes . . . . But served his country . And I hope we can add — honorably . ”
That would certainly be the shorthand version of a tribute not due , one prays , anytime soon . His eulogists have had to bide their time since October 1967 , exactly half a century ago when he was shot down over Hanoi , and may it be years more before they are needed to sum up a career of thoroughly honorable service that , if less than perfect by John McCain ’ s own measure , to most of us looks pretty damn close . As that heartbroken father of the Fitzgerald sailor might well have thought to himself , this is a great man , once more the very picture of personal courage . And an example like that is never old news .

On the 50th anniversary of his being shot down over Hanoi

Editor’s Note: We are re-posting this appreciation of John McCain from 2017 to mark his passing.

In early 1982, one of my several housemates at the time informed me that he would be leaving our place in Tempe, Ariz., and moving into a spare room in the home of a newly married couple nearby, the husband a former POW and all-but-announced candidate for Congress. My friend had been hired as the aspiring congressman’s very first full-time political aide. And, as soon as he had settled in, he wanted to introduce his new employer to me and a few others we knew from Arizona State University. Would I like to come by and meet John McCain?

If I’d had any clue then what a noted figure the man would become in political history — allowing me, far into the future, a minor part in his presidential campaign — I would have paid closer attention when the day came and we all sat down to chat in his living room on Lamplighter Street. My memory of the visit is a little sketchy now, although I do recall noticing, back when people still remarked on them, the prematurely white hair and constricted arm movements, both features courtesy of McCain’s captors in North Vietnam.

John and Cindy hadn’t lived in their house very long; moving boxes were still in sight, and the furniture had a fresh-from-the-showroom feel. Representative John Rhodes, the district’s venerable voice in Congress, had a few weeks earlier signaled his retirement, and no piece of Tempe real estate ever moved faster than this place the McCains had just bought, relocating to CD-1 from Phoenix, a 15-minute drive away.

The absurd backstory is that the two or three of us invited there were C. S. Lewis enthusiasts, in a small group at ASU, eight students at most, named for the day of our weekly discussions of the Oxford don’s wisdom — “The Tuesday Club.” Hoping to show he had useful connections, my ex-housemate had apparently been vague about our size and mission, leaving McCain to imagine he was doing business with the delegation of an influential college organization, some key piece of the district puzzle he could grab early on.

I figured out the situation only when, wrapping things up, McCain turned to me with an earnest pitch: “So, if I get into this race, I’d be honored if I could count on the support of the Tuesday Club.” My friends and I nodded assurances — yes, we would certainly consider it — finished off a tray of treats Cindy had brought out, and departed leaving no suspicion that the candidate-to-be had just thrown away an afternoon.

Today’s storied “maverick” of the Senate was back then a regular sight around ASU, addressing ROTC and other student groups, pressing campaign buttons on passersby in the Sun Devil Stadium parking lot, finding the people with actual influence in the district, and with a stamina and personal story impossible to match making himself, by 1986, the obvious successor to Barry Goldwater.

From there it was on to all his years as a presence in national politics, although my own next brush with his career came in 2000 as a speechwriter in the campaign of George W. Bush. And, I admit, I didn’t mind at all that some Republican voters that year didn’t care for the senator, regarding him as a media pet and creature of Washington.

Happily, his second chance in 2008 would bring one for me, too. I didn’t really know anyone on his team but made it my business to meet them, and from late March until Election Day I got my best look at John McCain in action, as America did as well. I wasn’t anything like a close adviser, just a late-arriving addition to the staff, scarcely remembered by the candidate from our Tempe encounters in the ’80s.

All the more in retrospect, what became the McCain-Palin enterprise was a great experience, leading to a loss that, on a résumé, I wouldn’t trade for other people’s victories. And before I got there, of course, the most improbable part of the effort had already unfolded — the “McCain Miracle.”

Reporters have lately been recalling the story with admiration, though at the time a charitable word for the candidate was hard to come by. In the months before the primaries, he had been written off, the quotable, ever-accessible straight talker of 2000 who had lost his charm, mostly because the situation in the Iraq war was desperate, he was associated with it, and he would not equivocate. His campaign was a wreck, his consultants had scattered, he was flying commercial and unaccompanied to New Hampshire. Continuing news coverage was termed a “death watch.”

‘We’re at 3 percent and the poll has a 5 percent margin of error,’ went John McCain’s stock line early in the 2008 campaign — along with that other old favorite: ‘In the words of Chairman Mao, “It’s always darkest before it’s totally black.”’

Veterans of the 1996 presidential contest could remember a vanishing of prominent friends and supporters as November neared, leaving Bob Dole in the last hours to face his fate practically alone on the stage except for the senator from Arizona. That was the shape of McCain’s own quest by late 2007. “We’re at 3 percent and the poll has a 5 percent margin of error,” went his stock line at the time — along with that other old favorite: “In the words of Chairman Mao, ‘It’s always darkest before it’s totally black.’”

He refused to quit and, above all, he would not abandon the cause in Iraq, saying — in surely the most enduring words of any 2008 candidate — “I would rather lose an election than see my country lose a war.”

He had been getting a dose of the same sort of counsel President Bush was hearing about the troop surge in Iraq: pointless, over, done, get out. Unlike so many others who had cast their votes to authorize that war, however, this senator had thought through the consequences before deciding, aware that enormous difficulties might come and that perseverance would be needed. He wouldn’t hedge. Tying his own fortunes to those of our troops, in what looked to some 70 percent of Americans like a futile effort, he was at that moment, as National Review editor Rich Lowry observed, “the very picture of courageous political leadership.”

I have never understood the contempt that some conservatives direct at the senator for McCain-Feingold, the old Gang of 8, or other matters on which he has by now, at the very least, earned the presumption of upright intention. He did not in early 2008, in any case, look like a man of the establishment. And, never mind the success of the surge in Iraq, his reward for grit was to hear himself, as the New Hampshire winner and eventual nominee, accused of wanting “a hundred-year war,” a phrase endlessly repeated by Barack Obama.

As if our candidate, with a son in Iraq at the time, really needed reminding of the cost and risk of a military commitment. Even more galling, later in 2008, was the impression put about by the Obama campaign and obliging reporters that the then-71-year-old senator was a little, you know, “erratic.” “Unsteady” and so oddly “angry,” too (who really knew what damage all that torture and solitary confinement had left?). It was an especially shabby touch, given McCain’s steadfastness on by far the hardest and most crucial security issue of that election year. And we now know that “unsteady” far better describes the presidential judgment that would later squander the gains of the surge to invite a wider conflict and tragedies worse than before — again, despite the warnings of Senator McCain.

Acknowledging his opponent’s military record, Obama always used the same formulation — “Of course, John McCain is an American hero, but . . . Now, John McCain is an American hero, but . . . ” — as if by repetition to make it seem obligatory and trite. No faulting him for that — the last thing the Obama campaign needed was thoughtful attention to what exactly their opponent’s heroism had entailed. How else, as a rival for high office, are you going to deal with a guy who spent five and a half years in extreme pain, privation, and loneliness in the hands of the enemy, at any moment of which he could have gone home by simply agreeing to be released out of turn?

One would think that, having made his acquaintance long before, I would by 2008 already have troubled myself to read Faith of My Fathers, McCain’s definitive telling of the prisoner-of-war experience, timed to introduce himself as a national contender in 2000. In truth, I didn’t get around to it until, as a McCain-Palin speechwriter, I had a practical reason for doing so. One of the senator’s many close collaborations with my 2008 colleague, the masterful Mark Salter, the book is a work of enduring beauty, a devotional to country that you’ll never forget, and I remember thinking, if we didn’t make it that year, what a loss to presidential literature.

Though to his credit McCain never let himself become a “professional POW,” forever trading on that identity, of course it’s everything, a long-ago passage through the underside of life that made him who he is. Just a few weeks ago, in a 60 Minutes interview, he called his bonds with fellow POWs “the joy of my life.” Here’s a passage that explains why, describing an exchange, in taps on the wall, with a man in the next cell named Bob Craner:

He was a remarkably composed man with the courage to accept any fate with great dignity. There were times when I would start to lose my nerve. I would detect some sign that another camp purge was coming, and my dread of another beating would start to get the better of my self-control. Anticipating a beating could prove more unnerving than the beating itself. “Bob, I think it’s coming again, and I don’t think they’ll miss us.” “If it comes, it comes,” he counseled me. “If it doesn’t, it doesn’t, and there isn’t a damn thing we can do about it.” It may strike others as odd that such fatalism could have comforted us, but it did. It was the best attitude you could hold under the circumstances. It steeled me when I was weak, and made me feel better about myself. Worrying about a beating was pointless. There wasn’t much I could do to prevent it, save disgrace myself, and disgrace hurt more than the worst beating.

You don’t get many points in politics anymore for modesty, understatement, or manful reserve, and the book in that way, like McCain’s Senate speeches, echoes a different era. There is not one false note or pretentious touch. There’s a wisdom, nobility, and self-knowledge beyond anything that politics has to teach. There are stories, too, that in both of his presidential campaigns should have spoken to the hearts of religious-conservative voters – who for reasons of their own never quite took to McCain – in ways far more important than a candidate’s standing at Bob Jones University, or his failure to grovel before this or that group.

Most impressive of all, McCain in the truly stirring parts of Faith of My Fathers extols the examples of other prisoners. (You have to hear their own accounts, as I have in person, to learn how much those fellow captives admired and counted on him.) In one well-known scene, later included in a movie, McCain recalls seeing a young sailor named Mike Christian fashioning an American flag from scraps of cloth, having just received merciless punishment for the same offense:

With his eyes nearly swollen shut from the beating, he had quietly picked up his needle and thread and begun sewing a new flag. I witnessed many acts of heroism in prison, but none braver than that. As I watched him, I felt a surge of pride at serving with him, and an equal measure of humility for lacking that extra ration of courage that distinguished Mike Christian from other men.

“Old news,” as many voters dismissed reminders of our candidate’s service. Not enough of them rated his life experiences “relevant to people like me,” as the pollsters put it. And so in November 2008 we ended up with the author of Dreams from My Father, a self-involved narrative with made-up characters, and not the author of Faith of My Fathers, the story of actual men who served and suffered for their country.

This was not, after all, some flash of glory in combat but the prolonged endurance of fear, despair, humiliation, brokenness, and the overcoming of evil by love and solidarity. When all that won’t cut it for people craving an “inspirational” figure, it is not the candidate who’s missing something.

We were spared a What Happened–type meditation after 2008, an agonizing over all of the loser’s bad breaks, but none was needed anyway. What happened was that when the market began to collapse in mid September, the good judgment of millions of voters went with it. Nor has the national political press corps ever been more hopelessly in the thrall of one candidate than it was that year, forgetting any respectable standard of journalism.

So often in politics we hear ringing or tough words offered as strength that are really, to borrow a phrase from Eric Hoffer, just ‘the weak man’s imitation of strength.’

Not even its partiality to Hillary Clinton in 2016, fear-driven, came anywhere near the obsequious pampering accorded to Obama, lest any disclosure, misstep, or hint of criticism be allowed to threaten his historic ascent. In a debate with McCain, Obama shared a moving autobiographical story of his own about how the health-care issue was “personal to me,” and stopped telling the story only when the election was safely behind him and some reporter with time on his hands finally bothered to look into it, establishing that no such thing had ever happened.

Palin, of course, was her own story, highlighted by the panic she caused to Democrats with her sparkling debut, within days turning a deficit of 6.4 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics polling average into a lead of 2.4. President Bush is said to have remarked, after her morale-boosting arrival on the scene, “That little lady has no idea what’s about to come her way,” and we all soon learned in the media savaging that followed.

A lesser man, when things got rough for his running mate, might have directed his frustration outward. Instead, as I saw a few times myself, he had only encouragement and kindness to offer, accepting the responsibility as his own. “On the upswing and the down,” as the authors of Game Change put it, “through the nastiest moments . . . , not an ill word escaped his lips about Palin. . . . . He treated Palin chivalrously, inquiring regularly about her well-being and that of her family. We asked a lot of her, McCain said, and he meant it.”

Wright: “I think that when people support you, it doesn’t mean that you support everything they say. Obviously, those words and those statements are statements that none of us would associate ourselves with, and I don’t believe that Senator Obama would support any of those, as well.”

It was a point of honor that I doubt would have restrained the Obama campaign in any comparable circumstances, and there were other such moments. If you’re feeling nostalgic sometime, have a look at videos from the fall of that year showing McCain at a town hall repeatedly calming and correcting people who called his opponent dangerous, or “an Arab,” or someone to be “scared of”: “No, ma’am. He’s a decent family man [and] citizen that I just happen to have disagreements with. . . . I have to tell you, Senator Obama is a decent person and a person you don’t have to be scared of as president of the United States. . . . We want to fight, and I will fight. But I will be respectful.”

And so on, these and similar answers actually earning him jeers and a shout of “Liar!” from the crowd. As in his bearing in delivering the concession speech (“And though we fell short, the failure is mine, not yours”), or setting the gold standard of grace at the Alfred E.

John McCain: American Hero

Senator John McCain Faces One More Fight, and Everyone’s in His Corner",www.nationalreview.com,right,b6RfuiHQ7fdDefLK
us_senate,CNN (Web News),0,http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/09/politics/five-fights-republican-senators-health-care/index.html,The five fights Republican senators will have on health care,2017-05-09,Lauren Fox,"( CNN ) Despite President Donald Trump 's celebration in the White House Rose Garden last week , Republicans still have a long way to go before they can finally make good on their promise to dismantle Obamacare .
Passing a health care bill out of the House was the first step , but now the challenge of guiding a bill through the Senate -- where Republicans have an even slimmer majority -- begins . Republican senators have already said they will craft their own legislation and will use a process known as budget reconciliation to move it out of the upper chamber with 51 votes instead of 60 , but that approach gives Majority Leader Mitch McConnell little room for error . Republicans can only afford two defections in their ranks .
Here are the five flash points you can expect as the Senate Republicans debate their way forward on health care :
Medicaid has long been in conservatives ' crosshairs , but the benefit for states has been undeniable . Medicaid expansion has been a lifeline for constituents who suffer from mental illness or addiction and have been able to access treatment through the expansion .
Of the 52 Republicans in the Senate , 20 hail from states that expanded Medicaid in recent years .
Ohio 's Rob Portman , Alaska 's Lisa Murkowski , West Virginia 's Shelley Moore Capito and Colorado 's Cory Gardner sent a letter to McConnell in March , when the House 's bill was first released , expressing their concerns with the way the House bill handled Medicaid expansion .
The House 's plan would end enhanced federal funding for Medicaid expansion in 2020 . After that year , individuals on the program were n't kicked off , but once they cycled off the program , they were n't allowed to re-enroll . Essentially , the House 's bill phased out Medicaid expansion over time .
The bill would also curtail federal support for the overall Medicaid program , giving states either a set amount of money per enrollee or a fixed block grant -- shifting the financial burden to the states .

Expect in the Senate that many of the lawmakers whose constituents have benefited from the Medicaid expansion will fight to keep the program intact longer . They will want to give individuals more time to transition off Medicaid and provide additional safety nets to ensure that people who may become ineligible for the program have another means to buy insurance . Meanwhile , expect Republicans who came from states that did n't expand Medicaid to argue that the program be phased out as soon as possible to save money .
One of the earliest controversies in the House 's health care bill was the issue of tax credits . Conservatives argued the House 's refundable tax credits were little more than a new entitlement program , a new name for the Obamacare subsidies Republicans had railed against for years . The similarities between the two -- Obamacare subsidies are also refundable tax credits -- prompted some lawmakers to dub the House plan `` Obamacare Lite . ''
But more moderate Republicans argued that refundable tax credits in the House bill were inadequate -- largely because the tax credits were based on age , not income .
As CNN reported at the time when the Congressional Budget Office released its initial score of the House 's bill , a 64-year-old making $ 26,500 would pay $ 1,700 for coverage in 2026 with Obamacare subsidies . But under House Speaker Paul Ryan 's plan , that same person would pay $ 14,600 in premiums with the GOP tax credits .
In an attempt to lower the burden for low-income and older Americans , expect some GOP senators to push for some sort of means testing , which would take into consideration someone 's income when calculating the size of their tax credit . In March , South Dakota Republican Sen. John Thune , a member of leadership and a member of the health care working group , introduced a proposal along those lines targeted to boost the size of tax credits for lower income people .
The House health care bill would defund Planned Parenthood for one year , a provision that could face increased scrutiny in the Senate where some moderate lawmakers like Sens . Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine have already said they 'd prefer to keep funding the women 's health care provider .
`` I , for one , do not believe that Planned Parenthood has any place in our deliberations on the Affordable Care Act , '' Murkowski told state lawmakers in Alaska in a speech earlier this year . `` Taxpayer dollars should never be used to pay for abortions , but I will not vote to deny Alaskans access to the health services that Planned Parenthood provides . ''
Taking the provision out could alienate the Senate 's conservatives who viewed the House 's funding repeal as a major victory and are now feeling pressure from outside religious groups to keep the defund in the Senate 's version of the bill .
One key Obamacare-era regulation that would be changed dramatically under the House 's health care bill protects people with pre-existing conditions .
The promise of protecting people with pre-existing conditions was at the epicenter of Trump 's own campaign stump speeches . But under the House 's health care bill , states would be able to opt out of the community rating protection , which would allow insurers to base premiums based on a person 's medical history . This would only apply to those who are not continuously insured .
Experts have argued that it could have major ramifications for people with pre-existing conditions .
Expect moderate Republicans to take a serious look at how to make sure that people with pre-existing conditions have additional safeguards as they craft their own bill . The messaging for Republicans has already been brutal as Democrats have very publicly argued that Republicans are gutting an overwhelmingly popular protection from the Affordable Care Act .
Under Obamacare , insurers are required to cover 10 key benefits for consumers . Those range from hospitalization to maternity care , but the House health care bill changes that . In an attempt to drive down premiums , the House 's conservative Freedom Caucus insisted that states be able to opt out of the essential health benefits requirements .
Conservatives in the Senate are expected to push for even more robust insurance deregulation in an attempt to lower premiums . One idea being considered would give states an `` opt in '' rather than an `` opt out '' on key Obamacare-era regulations like requiring insurers cover the 10 essential health benefits .
But that could stir concerns from moderate senators who already fear that the GOP has gone too far to scale down insurance protections for consumers back home . Waiving the essential health benefits could hurt people with pre-existing conditions because insurers could opt not to cover their treatment . Also , it could make it harder for those dealing with substance abuse or mental health issues to get help .","(CNN) Despite President Donald Trump's celebration in the White House Rose Garden last week, Republicans still have a long way to go before they can finally make good on their promise to dismantle Obamacare.

Passing a health care bill out of the House was the first step, but now the challenge of guiding a bill through the Senate -- where Republicans have an even slimmer majority -- begins. Republican senators have already said they will craft their own legislation and will use a process known as budget reconciliation to move it out of the upper chamber with 51 votes instead of 60, but that approach gives Majority Leader Mitch McConnell little room for error. Republicans can only afford two defections in their ranks.

Here are the five flash points you can expect as the Senate Republicans debate their way forward on health care:

Medicaid

Medicaid has long been in conservatives' crosshairs, but the benefit for states has been undeniable. Medicaid expansion has been a lifeline for constituents who suffer from mental illness or addiction and have been able to access treatment through the expansion.

Of the 52 Republicans in the Senate, 20 hail from states that expanded Medicaid in recent years.

Ohio's Rob Portman, Alaska's Lisa Murkowski, West Virginia's Shelley Moore Capito and Colorado's Cory Gardner sent a letter to McConnell in March, when the House's bill was first released, expressing their concerns with the way the House bill handled Medicaid expansion.

The House's plan would end enhanced federal funding for Medicaid expansion in 2020. After that year, individuals on the program weren't kicked off, but once they cycled off the program, they weren't allowed to re-enroll. Essentially, the House's bill phased out Medicaid expansion over time.

The bill would also curtail federal support for the overall Medicaid program, giving states either a set amount of money per enrollee or a fixed block grant -- shifting the financial burden to the states.

Expect in the Senate that many of the lawmakers whose constituents have benefited from the Medicaid expansion will fight to keep the program intact longer. They will want to give individuals more time to transition off Medicaid and provide additional safety nets to ensure that people who may become ineligible for the program have another means to buy insurance. Meanwhile, expect Republicans who came from states that didn't expand Medicaid to argue that the program be phased out as soon as possible to save money.

Tax credits

One of the earliest controversies in the House's health care bill was the issue of tax credits. Conservatives argued the House's refundable tax credits were little more than a new entitlement program, a new name for the Obamacare subsidies Republicans had railed against for years. The similarities between the two -- Obamacare subsidies are also refundable tax credits -- prompted some lawmakers to dub the House plan ""Obamacare Lite.""

But more moderate Republicans argued that refundable tax credits in the House bill were inadequate -- largely because the tax credits were based on age, not income.

As CNN reported at the time when the Congressional Budget Office released its initial score of the House's bill, a 64-year-old making $26,500 would pay $1,700 for coverage in 2026 with Obamacare subsidies. But under House Speaker Paul Ryan's plan, that same person would pay $14,600 in premiums with the GOP tax credits.

In an attempt to lower the burden for low-income and older Americans, expect some GOP senators to push for some sort of means testing, which would take into consideration someone's income when calculating the size of their tax credit. In March, South Dakota Republican Sen. John Thune, a member of leadership and a member of the health care working group, introduced a proposal along those lines targeted to boost the size of tax credits for lower income people.

Planned Parenthood

The House health care bill would defund Planned Parenthood for one year, a provision that could face increased scrutiny in the Senate where some moderate lawmakers like Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine have already said they'd prefer to keep funding the women's health care provider.

""I, for one, do not believe that Planned Parenthood has any place in our deliberations on the Affordable Care Act,"" Murkowski told state lawmakers in Alaska in a speech earlier this year. ""Taxpayer dollars should never be used to pay for abortions, but I will not vote to deny Alaskans access to the health services that Planned Parenthood provides.""

Taking the provision out could alienate the Senate's conservatives who viewed the House's funding repeal as a major victory and are now feeling pressure from outside religious groups to keep the defund in the Senate's version of the bill.

Pre-existing conditions

One key Obamacare-era regulation that would be changed dramatically under the House's health care bill protects people with pre-existing conditions.

The promise of protecting people with pre-existing conditions was at the epicenter of Trump's own campaign stump speeches. But under the House's health care bill, states would be able to opt out of the community rating protection, which would allow insurers to base premiums based on a person's medical history. This would only apply to those who are not continuously insured.

Experts have argued that it could have major ramifications for people with pre-existing conditions.

Expect moderate Republicans to take a serious look at how to make sure that people with pre-existing conditions have additional safeguards as they craft their own bill. The messaging for Republicans has already been brutal as Democrats have very publicly argued that Republicans are gutting an overwhelmingly popular protection from the Affordable Care Act.

Essential Health Benefits

Under Obamacare, insurers are required to cover 10 key benefits for consumers. Those range from hospitalization to maternity care, but the House health care bill changes that. In an attempt to drive down premiums, the House's conservative Freedom Caucus insisted that states be able to opt out of the essential health benefits requirements.

Conservatives in the Senate are expected to push for even more robust insurance deregulation in an attempt to lower premiums. One idea being considered would give states an ""opt in"" rather than an ""opt out"" on key Obamacare-era regulations like requiring insurers cover the 10 essential health benefits.

But that could stir concerns from moderate senators who already fear that the GOP has gone too far to scale down insurance protections for consumers back home. Waiving the essential health benefits could hurt people with pre-existing conditions because insurers could opt not to cover their treatment. Also, it could make it harder for those dealing with substance abuse or mental health issues to get help.",www.cnn.com,left,daqJSs0S8BhvS6T4

Bernie Sanders ( I-VT ) is releasing a new plan to give every single American free health insurance .
On Wednesday , Sanders will release a single-payer health care bill that about one-third of Senate Democrats have already vowed to support . Historically , Hillary Clinton and most Senate Democrats have opposed advancing single-payer health care , and Sanders found zero supporters for the same version of the bill when he introduced it in 2014 .
“ We had me . And that was it , ” Sanders told me in an interview in his Senate office on Tuesday after the 11th Senate Democrat publicly backed his bill .
But now 15 Senate Democrats — many of whom are potential 2020 contenders — have signed on to the bill , even though it hasn ’ t yet been publicly released . Sanders ’ s new “ Medicare-for-all ” bill , the product of months of debate and negotiations , may be the most detailed single-payer legislation introduced in Congress .
The bill ’ s newfound popularity will surely come with scrutiny , and in our interview Sanders acknowledged the difficulty of the policy trade-offs in crafting the bill .
“ This is complicated stuff . And you know what ? There ’ s nobody who has all of the answers . Nobody has all the answers , ” he said .
For all the wonky policy objections raised against his single-payer plan , Sanders returns to what he regards as the fundamental reason animating his renewed Medicare-for-all legislation : 28 million Americans still lack health insurance , and about 30 percent still say they face personal crises over medical debt and making insurance payments .
“ Millions of Americans today — who do not go to the doctor when they should , because they ca n't afford the health care bill — many of them will get sicker than they should have been . And some of them will die , ” Sanders said .
“ What this struggle is about really , honestly , is not a health care debate . Should health care be guaranteed to all people ? Most people say yes . Are we wasting an enormous amount of money in the current system ? Most people would say yes . Can we take on the drug companies and the insurance companies and Wall Street and their unlimited sums of money to influence Congress ? ... That 's a major political struggle that we have to engage in . ”
Sanders and I delved into the policy mechanics of his bill . We also discussed whether he ’ ll attack Democrats who won ’ t support his bill ( no ) , whether he ’ ll tell his supporters to stand down ( also no ) , and how he explains Democrats ’ sudden interest in single-payer .
A lightly edited transcript of our interview follows . ███ ’ s Kelly Swanson helped prepare the transcript .
The crisis in the American health care system that Bernie ’ s bill is trying to solve
So I want to start out by talking about the current gaps and crises in the American health care system . Twenty-eight million Americans are still uninsured . Upward of 30 percent still struggle to pay [ their ] medical bills .
I want to ask : What is the major crisis this bill addresses , and how , specifically , are you going to address [ it ] ?
Here is the crisis : 28 million , as you 've indicated , have zero health insurance . Even more are underinsured , with high deductibles and high copayments , and the projection is that health care costs are going to continue to rise .
What that means in practical terms is there are millions of Americans today who do not go to the doctor when they should , because they ca n't afford the health care bill . Many of them will get sicker than they should have been . And some of them will die . That 's just the sad fact .
So the question that we have got to ask ourselves is : Should health care in the year 2017 in the United States of America be a right of all people ? Or is it just the privilege of wealth ? In other words , if you got the money , you can go out and get pretty great health care . [ If ] I do n't have the money , well , I do n't get that health care .
Or should we join the rest of the industrialized world and say that it does n't matter whether you 're rich or poor , young or old , healthy or sick — health care is a right . Every other major country on Earth has decided that health care is a right , and we 've got to do the same . That 's No . 1 .
No . 2 : a very important question , which is virtually not discussed by the media or discussed here in Congress , and that is why is it that despite all those without any health insurance or who are underinsured , we end up spending almost twice as much per capita per person on health care as the people of any other nation ?
Why is it in Canada they spend less than $ 5,000 per person and guarantee health care to all of their people ? We spend almost $ 10,000 , and we have so many people uninsured or underinsured .
Thirdly , why are we paying the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs , so that one out of five Americans under 64 can not afford the medicine that they need ? Those are the questions that in fact we do answer in our legislation .
Sanders on ending private health insurance and “ legitimate concerns ” around single-payer
One hundred and fifty million people currently rely on their employer-sponsored health care plans for insurance . And I 'm curious why you think eliminating that is an essential foundation of universal health care . Some Senate Democrats say we can achieve universal health care without eliminating [ private markets ] .
Well , you can , but you ca n't save the kinds of money that we have to save and create the kind of system that I think we need .
So here are the reasons [ for ] a rational health care system , if we were sitting down and saying , “ Okay , what is our goal ? What does a rational health care system look like ? ” And what it looks like is saying everybody is in .
We 're going to guarantee health care to all people . And it 's a pretty expensive proposition , providing health care to all people , of course . Health care is expensive . How do we do it in the most cost-effective way ? And the most cost-effective way is not allowing insurance companies and drug companies to make hundreds of billions of dollars a year in profits from human illness .
It is also not creating an incredibly complicated system . We have hundreds of different insurance programs in this country that have to be administered at great cost . Right ? So you have a $ 5,000 deductible ; I have a $ 3,000 deductible ; he has a $ 50 copayment . You can ’ t go to that doctor , but she can go to that doctor . It 's an incredibly complicated system , and we are wasting hundreds of billions of dollars administering this incredibly complicated system . ... You ’ re having doctors who have been increasingly demoralized , nurses demoralized because they ca n't even provide the health care they need or they want for their patients , because the drug companies and insurance companies are interfering in the delivery of that health care . That 's one important issue .
And there 's another one from an economic point of view , and that is , right now — you 're right , of course — most Americans get their health care from their employers .
Go and talk to employers — especially small businesses — and find out how much time and energy they are wasting trying to provide health insurance to their employees .
Their job is to make widgets , or to provide services or do whatever they 're supposed to be doing . And yet they 're spending a lot of time and energy providing health care to their employees , which they would prefer to spend focusing on their business mission .
Then you also talk to people who say , “ You know , I really do n't like my job , [ I ] really hate my job , but I go to my job because my wife is ill and I have to make sure that I have good coverage to take care of her. ” Is that a way to run an economy ? So there are a lot of reasons why I think we need to do what virtually every other country has done , and get private insurance companies out of the essential health care .
Sixty-one percent of Americans said that they 're satisfied with their current health insurance plans . How does this bill — or how do you — plan on reassuring them that the care this bill would provide is either better [ than ] or comparable to what they currently have and like ?
And as a second , corollary question : Do you worry about the political impact of telling all of these people , “ Hey , you 're going to have to switch plans ” ? President Obama got a huge backlash over saying —
Look , the real question to be asked , or one of the questions I ask , is why is it that we 're spending so much compared to other countries ? Why [ do ] we have so many people uninsured ? What 's the answer to that ? And the answer is that is not too many people go around defending the health care system . ... [ But ] the drug companies since 1998 have spent over $ 3 billion in lobbying and hundreds of billions of dollars in campaign contributions , and the insurance companies are No . 2 .
In other words , what this struggle is about really , honestly , is not a health care debate . Should health care be guaranteed to all people ? Most people say yes . Are we wasting an enormous amount of money in the current system ? Most people would say yes . Can we take on the drug companies and the insurance companies and Wall Street and their unlimited sums of money to influence Congress ? That is another issue , and that 's a major political struggle that we have to engage in .
But in terms of answering your question — you know one of the lies that will be thrown out at us is that “ this [ is ] government health care ; you 're gon na have to go to a government doctor. ” Total nonsense . You go to the same doctor . You go to any damn doctor you want to go to . What 's going to change is the wording on the card that you have . It will no longer be United Health Insurance or Blue Cross Blue Shield . It 'll be Medicare-for-all .
You go to the doctor you want who will still be practicing in exactly the same way he or she practices today . Go to the same hospital . So do n't let anyone tell you that suddenly this is going to be government-run health care and every health care worker in America or every doctor is going to be a government employee . Not the case .
Sanders ’ s “ pledge : ” middle-class families will pay less in combined taxes and health care
So on the question of financing , there was a lot of talk during the campaign that your bill did n't have specified pay-fors — or , insofar , as there were financing plans drawn up by health economists and experts , that there was this concern that some middle-class families would see tax hikes in the end .
Another concern is that the savings from not having to pay for insurance would not be greater than those tax hikes . How do you ensure that —
Let me be very honest . We ’ re dealing with one-sixth of the American economy . This is complicated stuff .
And you know what ? There ’ s nobody who has all of the answers . Nobody has all the answers . What I can say is we are going to be listing a number of revenue-raising proposals , which will generate more than enough money to pay for what we want to do .
But here is the point . And I have to say , rather amazingly , how many of my political opponents were people who disagree with me on this issue — mostly Republicans and the media forget about it . Right now , if you are a family of four and you 're self-employed , for example , you might go out and be spending $ 10,000 to $ 18,000 a year for private health insurance . Right ? We ’ re going to eliminate that .
And , yes , your taxes are going up . But if you are a middle-class person , you will be paying less overall for health care and taxes than you are paying today . That 's what our pledge is . Yes , you 'll be paying more in taxes , but you 'll be paying less — zero — in private insurance . So I think what Republicans will go around saying , “ They ’ re raising your taxes. ” They will forget that 30 seconds [ in an ad that ] I have to tell you you 're no longer paying private insurance if you 're a small business . You 're no longer having to provide insurance to your employees . So there are two sides of the equation .
One concern I 've heard — and I 'm curious for your reaction to — is a lot of union representatives have health care deals that have taken brutal toil and sweat to win , to force their employers to give them these agreements for health care benefits .
All of a sudden they 're getting hit with a tax increase from this bill , while also maybe losing the benefits they had to negotiate for . How do you assure those folks ?
What you 're saying is that over the years , an employer may say , “ You ’ re going to get a raise or a wage increase , or we ’ re going to maintain or not hurt you so much in terms of health. ” I do understand that concern .
I think what we can also say [ is ] that right now if you look at a lot of the labor disputes that go on , very often they have to do with health care . They have to do with employers saying , hey , you know what , we 're raising deductibles , raise your copayments . And sometimes we are seeing strikes just around those issues .
So I think what we can say to those workers is they will be better off financially and that their business that they work for will be better off financially . One of the things we do n't talk about is that American companies today have got to compete in a global economy in which in most instances , but not all , their competition does not have to worry about providing health insurance to their workers because their governments do that .
So just to stay on this point for one more second , how do you ensure workers that their bosses won ’ t just pocket this ? How do you make sure ?
I mean , this is a big issue , and we are introducing comprehensive legislation at a time when we have Donald Trump as president , who wanted to throw 32 million people off the health insurance . You know , Mitch McConnell , Paul Ryan , running the Senate and the House . We 're not going to get this thing done with these guys in power .
And what we are doing is taking an idea out to the American people , and you 're going to see a lot of discussion about these ideas and [ a ] lot of refinement of what we are talking about . But I think that any serious discussion of where we are today , in terms of the dysfunctionality of the system , in terms of the cost of this system , will suggest that going forward will be a significant improvement .
One thing I thought was really interesting in the summary of the bill we got is if you look at the last title , it calls for doing this by dropping the Medicare eligibility age every few years . The [ John ] Conyers bill does that overnight — in closer to two years , everyone is insured .
This would do that in three or four steps . Could you talk about the trade-offs there and how you came up with this plan ?
I wish that I could say that — you know , maybe ... somebody could make the argument that tomorrow , or in a given day six months from now , we can put everybody into one program . And I 'm not sure that 's not correct .
But what we want to do — there are people who are concerned about the transition process . This is the big deal . So what we have said is that in the first year we are going to improve Medicare for the elderly by providing dental care and audiology treatment , which is not currently the case . And what we 're also going to do is lower the eligibility age from 65 to 55 , and we 're going to cover all children under 18 . That ’ s a pretty big deal .
So the system 's going to have to digest that idea , and then we 're going to go from 55 down to 45 , 45 down to 35 [ and so on ] . So it gives the system the time to adjust .
Sanders won ’ t attack Senate Democrats who are against the bill , but he won ’ t tell his supporters to stand down
Why are more Senate Democrats supporting this now ? Often , you hear about when a party loses the election , it tries to move to the center . Democrats ’ ambitions and dreams are growing , and the Democratic establishment is opening up to this idea .
Why do you think that is happening ? And then as a follow-up : How do you think your supporters should respond to or treat Senate Democrats who were reluctant to get on this or haven ’ t ? Should it be a matter of pressuring them , campaigns , sit-ins ?
I ’ ll answer both the questions . I will tell you that three years ago — when we introduced this legislation four years ago — we had me , and that was it . So the sentiment , not only here in Congress but , I think , among the American people is moving in our direction .
Here 's where we are politically . President Obama led the way to passage of the Affordable Care Act . In my view , the Affordable Care Act has made some very significant improvements in American health care . You know , we kind of brush it off . But 20 million more people are now insured than was previously the case . It may not seem like a big deal here on Capitol Hill . Everybody has insurance . That 's a pretty significant improvement if you 're in a state like West Virginia and Kentucky and you get health insurance . Second of all , and again , we brush it off now , but we did away with obscenities like preexisting conditions . There are other very positive attributes associated with the Affordable Care Act .
But having said that , what everybody recognizes is that the health care system , despite the gains in the ACA , has serious problems , and they are growing costs , high deductibles , high copayments , 28 million people uninsured , lack of freedom of choice regarding the doctor you go to , burdens on employers , burdens on workers .
Then the Republicans said , “ There are problems with the system , and our solution is to throw 23 million people off of health insurance and give tax breaks to the rich. ” Most Americans thought that was a pretty stupid idea . You do n't improve the system by throwing 23 million people off health insurance .
We are where we are today : We have seen gains in the ACA , but many serious problems remain . And I think the American people are looking for answers on what you 're seeing at the grassroots level and what you 're seeing in polling , as more and more people say , “ You know what ? The United States government should take responsibility for making sure that people have health care. ” So that 's why I think we are where we are .
Your second question is a very political question . Am I going to go around and attack people who do not support my proposal ? I do n't do that , and I 'm not going to do that . You know [ there are ] a lot of different issues out there , and people disagree with me . People have to make their own assessments , and the electorate decides the course of action in terms of elections . But I 'm not going to be criticizing people .
Well , it 's a question . Look , I happen to believe in democracy , and people will do what they will do .
We are going to be mounting a massive grassroots effort across this country to educate and to organize . That 's what we will do . We 're going to have to take on Wall Street , the drug companies , the insurance companies , the corporate media . We 're going to have to explain what a Medicare-for-all , single-payer system means .
So it 's going to take a lot of work — and that 's what we intend to do .
Do you worry about Senate Democrats being put in a tough spot ? If [ Montana Sen. ] John Tester wants to win over the Bernie voters in Montana — I believe a state you won — without being a co-sponsor , he appears to feel like he ’ s signing on to a political risk ?
The people who run for United States Senate who are in the United States Senate are very big boys and big girls —they have to deal with many , many issues and many problems .
Many of my Democratic colleagues have had to sustain zillions of dollars of dishonest Republican 30-second ads . They will make the case that they can to their constituencies . You know what ? That 's called democracy . You know , I respect [ that ] . People have different points of view [ and can ] make their case .","Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) is releasing a new plan to give every single American free health insurance.

And he’s ready to defend it.

The bill’s newfound popularity will surely come with scrutiny, and in our interview Sanders acknowledged the difficulty of the policy trade-offs in crafting the bill.

“This is complicated stuff. And you know what? There’s nobody who has all of the answers. Nobody has all the answers,” he said.

For all the wonky policy objections raised against his single-payer plan, Sanders returns to what he regards as the fundamental reason animating his renewed Medicare-for-all legislation: 28 million Americans still lack health insurance, and about 30 percent still say they face personal crises over medical debt and making insurance payments.

“Millions of Americans today — who do not go to the doctor when they should, because they can't afford the health care bill — many of them will get sicker than they should have been. And some of them will die,” Sanders said.

“What this struggle is about really, honestly, is not a health care debate. Should health care be guaranteed to all people? Most people say yes. Are we wasting an enormous amount of money in the current system? Most people would say yes. Can we take on the drug companies and the insurance companies and Wall Street and their unlimited sums of money to influence Congress? ... That's a major political struggle that we have to engage in.”

Sanders and I delved into the policy mechanics of his bill. We also discussed whether he’ll attack Democrats who won’t support his bill (no), whether he’ll tell his supporters to stand down (also no), and how he explains Democrats’ sudden interest in single-payer.

A lightly edited transcript of our interview follows. Vox’s Kelly Swanson helped prepare the transcript.

The crisis in the American health care system that Bernie’s bill is trying to solve

Jeff Stein

So I want to start out by talking about the current gaps and crises in the American health care system. Twenty-eight million Americans are still uninsured. Upward of 30 percent still struggle to pay [their] medical bills.

I want to ask: What is the major crisis this bill addresses, and how, specifically, are you going to address [it]?

Bernie Sanders

Here is the crisis: 28 million, as you've indicated, have zero health insurance. Even more are underinsured, with high deductibles and high copayments, and the projection is that health care costs are going to continue to rise.

What that means in practical terms is there are millions of Americans today who do not go to the doctor when they should, because they can't afford the health care bill. Many of them will get sicker than they should have been. And some of them will die. That's just the sad fact.

So the question that we have got to ask ourselves is: Should health care in the year 2017 in the United States of America be a right of all people? Or is it just the privilege of wealth? In other words, if you got the money, you can go out and get pretty great health care. [If] I don't have the money, well, I don't get that health care.

Or should we join the rest of the industrialized world and say that it doesn't matter whether you're rich or poor, young or old, healthy or sick — health care is a right. Every other major country on Earth has decided that health care is a right, and we've got to do the same. That's No. 1.

No. 2: a very important question, which is virtually not discussed by the media or discussed here in Congress, and that is why is it that despite all those without any health insurance or who are underinsured, we end up spending almost twice as much per capita per person on health care as the people of any other nation?

Why is it in Canada they spend less than $5,000 per person and guarantee health care to all of their people? We spend almost $10,000, and we have so many people uninsured or underinsured.

Thirdly, why are we paying the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, so that one out of five Americans under 64 cannot afford the medicine that they need? Those are the questions that in fact we do answer in our legislation.

Sanders on ending private health insurance and “legitimate concerns” around single-payer

Jeff Stein

One hundred and fifty million people currently rely on their employer-sponsored health care plans for insurance. And I'm curious why you think eliminating that is an essential foundation of universal health care. Some Senate Democrats say we can achieve universal health care without eliminating [private markets].

Bernie Sanders

Well, you can, but you can't save the kinds of money that we have to save and create the kind of system that I think we need.

So here are the reasons [for] a rational health care system, if we were sitting down and saying, “Okay, what is our goal? What does a rational health care system look like?” And what it looks like is saying everybody is in.

We're going to guarantee health care to all people. And it's a pretty expensive proposition, providing health care to all people, of course. Health care is expensive. How do we do it in the most cost-effective way? And the most cost-effective way is not allowing insurance companies and drug companies to make hundreds of billions of dollars a year in profits from human illness.

It is also not creating an incredibly complicated system. We have hundreds of different insurance programs in this country that have to be administered at great cost. Right? So you have a $5,000 deductible; I have a $3,000 deductible; he has a $50 copayment. You can’t go to that doctor, but she can go to that doctor. It's an incredibly complicated system, and we are wasting hundreds of billions of dollars administering this incredibly complicated system. ... You’re having doctors who have been increasingly demoralized, nurses demoralized because they can't even provide the health care they need or they want for their patients, because the drug companies and insurance companies are interfering in the delivery of that health care. That's one important issue.

And there's another one from an economic point of view, and that is, right now — you're right, of course — most Americans get their health care from their employers.

Go and talk to employers — especially small businesses — and find out how much time and energy they are wasting trying to provide health insurance to their employees.

Their job is to make widgets, or to provide services or do whatever they're supposed to be doing. And yet they're spending a lot of time and energy providing health care to their employees, which they would prefer to spend focusing on their business mission.

Then you also talk to people who say, “You know, I really don't like my job, [I] really hate my job, but I go to my job because my wife is ill and I have to make sure that I have good coverage to take care of her.” Is that a way to run an economy? So there are a lot of reasons why I think we need to do what virtually every other country has done, and get private insurance companies out of the essential health care.

Jeff Stein

Sixty-one percent of Americans said that they're satisfied with their current health insurance plans. How does this bill — or how do you — plan on reassuring them that the care this bill would provide is either better [than] or comparable to what they currently have and like?

And as a second, corollary question: Do you worry about the political impact of telling all of these people, “Hey, you're going to have to switch plans”? President Obama got a huge backlash over saying —

Bernie Sanders

It’s not a question of switching plans.

Look, the real question to be asked, or one of the questions I ask, is why is it that we're spending so much compared to other countries? Why [do] we have so many people uninsured? What's the answer to that? And the answer is that is not too many people go around defending the health care system. ... [But] the drug companies since 1998 have spent over $3 billion in lobbying and hundreds of billions of dollars in campaign contributions, and the insurance companies are No. 2.

In other words, what this struggle is about really, honestly, is not a health care debate. Should health care be guaranteed to all people? Most people say yes. Are we wasting an enormous amount of money in the current system? Most people would say yes. Can we take on the drug companies and the insurance companies and Wall Street and their unlimited sums of money to influence Congress? That is another issue, and that's a major political struggle that we have to engage in.

But in terms of answering your question — you know one of the lies that will be thrown out at us is that “this [is] government health care; you're gonna have to go to a government doctor.” Total nonsense. You go to the same doctor. You go to any damn doctor you want to go to. What's going to change is the wording on the card that you have. It will no longer be United Health Insurance or Blue Cross Blue Shield. It'll be Medicare-for-all.

You go to the doctor you want who will still be practicing in exactly the same way he or she practices today. Go to the same hospital. So don't let anyone tell you that suddenly this is going to be government-run health care and every health care worker in America or every doctor is going to be a government employee. Not the case.

Sanders’s “pledge:” middle-class families will pay less in combined taxes and health care

Jeff Stein

So on the question of financing, there was a lot of talk during the campaign that your bill didn't have specified pay-fors — or, insofar, as there were financing plans drawn up by health economists and experts, that there was this concern that some middle-class families would see tax hikes in the end.

Another concern is that the savings from not having to pay for insurance would not be greater than those tax hikes. How do you ensure that —

Bernie Sanders

Let me be very honest. We’re dealing with one-sixth of the American economy. This is complicated stuff.

And you know what? There’s nobody who has all of the answers. Nobody has all the answers. What I can say is we are going to be listing a number of revenue-raising proposals, which will generate more than enough money to pay for what we want to do.

But here is the point. And I have to say, rather amazingly, how many of my political opponents were people who disagree with me on this issue — mostly Republicans and the media forget about it. Right now, if you are a family of four and you're self-employed, for example, you might go out and be spending $10,000 to $18,000 a year for private health insurance. Right? We’re going to eliminate that.

And, yes, your taxes are going up. But if you are a middle-class person, you will be paying less overall for health care and taxes than you are paying today. That's what our pledge is. Yes, you'll be paying more in taxes, but you'll be paying less — zero — in private insurance. So I think what Republicans will go around saying, “They’re raising your taxes.” They will forget that 30 seconds [in an ad that] I have to tell you you're no longer paying private insurance if you're a small business. You're no longer having to provide insurance to your employees. So there are two sides of the equation.

Jeff Stein

One concern I've heard — and I'm curious for your reaction to — is a lot of union representatives have health care deals that have taken brutal toil and sweat to win, to force their employers to give them these agreements for health care benefits.

All of a sudden they're getting hit with a tax increase from this bill, while also maybe losing the benefits they had to negotiate for. How do you assure those folks?

Bernie Sanders

I understand that. And that's a legitimate concern.

What you're saying is that over the years, an employer may say, “You’re going to get a raise or a wage increase, or we’re going to maintain or not hurt you so much in terms of health.” I do understand that concern.

I think what we can also say [is] that right now if you look at a lot of the labor disputes that go on, very often they have to do with health care. They have to do with employers saying, hey, you know what, we're raising deductibles, raise your copayments. And sometimes we are seeing strikes just around those issues.

So I think what we can say to those workers is they will be better off financially and that their business that they work for will be better off financially. One of the things we don't talk about is that American companies today have got to compete in a global economy in which in most instances, but not all, their competition does not have to worry about providing health insurance to their workers because their governments do that.

Jeff Stein

So just to stay on this point for one more second, how do you ensure workers that their bosses won’t just pocket this? How do you make sure?

Bernie Sanders

I mean, this is a big issue, and we are introducing comprehensive legislation at a time when we have Donald Trump as president, who wanted to throw 32 million people off the health insurance. You know, Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan, running the Senate and the House. We're not going to get this thing done with these guys in power.

And what we are doing is taking an idea out to the American people, and you're going to see a lot of discussion about these ideas and [a] lot of refinement of what we are talking about. But I think that any serious discussion of where we are today, in terms of the dysfunctionality of the system, in terms of the cost of this system, will suggest that going forward will be a significant improvement.

Jeff Stein

One thing I thought was really interesting in the summary of the bill we got is if you look at the last title, it calls for doing this by dropping the Medicare eligibility age every few years. The [John] Conyers bill does that overnight — in closer to two years, everyone is insured.

This would do that in three or four steps. Could you talk about the trade-offs there and how you came up with this plan?

Bernie Sanders

I wish that I could say that — you know, maybe ... somebody could make the argument that tomorrow, or in a given day six months from now, we can put everybody into one program. And I'm not sure that's not correct.

But what we want to do — there are people who are concerned about the transition process. This is the big deal. So what we have said is that in the first year we are going to improve Medicare for the elderly by providing dental care and audiology treatment, which is not currently the case. And what we're also going to do is lower the eligibility age from 65 to 55, and we're going to cover all children under 18. That’s a pretty big deal.

So the system's going to have to digest that idea, and then we're going to go from 55 down to 45, 45 down to 35 [and so on]. So it gives the system the time to adjust.

Sanders won’t attack Senate Democrats who are against the bill, but he won’t tell his supporters to stand down

Jeff Stein

Why are more Senate Democrats supporting this now? Often, you hear about when a party loses the election, it tries to move to the center. Democrats’ ambitions and dreams are growing, and the Democratic establishment is opening up to this idea.

Why do you think that is happening? And then as a follow-up: How do you think your supporters should respond to or treat Senate Democrats who were reluctant to get on this or haven’t? Should it be a matter of pressuring them, campaigns, sit-ins?

Bernie Sanders

I’ll answer both the questions. I will tell you that three years ago — when we introduced this legislation four years ago — we had me, and that was it. So the sentiment, not only here in Congress but, I think, among the American people is moving in our direction.

Here's where we are politically. President Obama led the way to passage of the Affordable Care Act. In my view, the Affordable Care Act has made some very significant improvements in American health care. You know, we kind of brush it off. But 20 million more people are now insured than was previously the case. It may not seem like a big deal here on Capitol Hill. Everybody has insurance. That's a pretty significant improvement if you're in a state like West Virginia and Kentucky and you get health insurance. Second of all, and again, we brush it off now, but we did away with obscenities like preexisting conditions. There are other very positive attributes associated with the Affordable Care Act.

But having said that, what everybody recognizes is that the health care system, despite the gains in the ACA, has serious problems, and they are growing costs, high deductibles, high copayments, 28 million people uninsured, lack of freedom of choice regarding the doctor you go to, burdens on employers, burdens on workers.

Then the Republicans said, “There are problems with the system, and our solution is to throw 23 million people off of health insurance and give tax breaks to the rich.” Most Americans thought that was a pretty stupid idea. You don't improve the system by throwing 23 million people off health insurance.

We are where we are today: We have seen gains in the ACA, but many serious problems remain. And I think the American people are looking for answers on what you're seeing at the grassroots level and what you're seeing in polling, as more and more people say, “You know what? The United States government should take responsibility for making sure that people have health care.” So that's why I think we are where we are.

Your second question is a very political question. Am I going to go around and attack people who do not support my proposal? I don't do that, and I'm not going to do that. You know [there are] a lot of different issues out there, and people disagree with me. People have to make their own assessments, and the electorate decides the course of action in terms of elections. But I'm not going to be criticizing people.

Jeff Stein

Would you urge your supporters not to?

Bernie Sanders

Well, it's a question. Look, I happen to believe in democracy, and people will do what they will do.

We are going to be mounting a massive grassroots effort across this country to educate and to organize. That's what we will do. We're going to have to take on Wall Street, the drug companies, the insurance companies, the corporate media. We're going to have to explain what a Medicare-for-all, single-payer system means.

So it's going to take a lot of work — and that's what we intend to do.

Jeff Stein

Do you worry about Senate Democrats being put in a tough spot? If [Montana Sen.] John Tester wants to win over the Bernie voters in Montana — I believe a state you won — without being a co-sponsor, he appears to feel like he’s signing on to a political risk?

Bernie Sanders

The people who run for United States Senate who are in the United States Senate are very big boys and big girls —they have to deal with many, many issues and many problems.

Many of my Democratic colleagues have had to sustain zillions of dollars of dishonest Republican 30-second ads. They will make the case that they can to their constituencies. You know what? That's called democracy. You know, I respect [that]. People have different points of view [and can] make their case.",www.vox.com,left,CIu12rEmoTOSgWC0

Sherrod Brown accused of making 'unwanted, sudden' advance against woman in 1980s",2018-10-19,Jessica Chasmar,"Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown is preparing to take legal action against his Republican challenger , Rep. Jim Renacci , after the congressman released a statement Thursday evening accusing him of sexual harassment 30 years ago .
Mr. Renacci ’ s Senate campaign released a lengthy statement by attorney Laura Mills telling the story of a “ very credible ” and “ professional ” unnamed woman who has accused Mr. Brown of making “ an unexpected , uninvited , unwanted , and sudden advance , roughly pushing her up against a wall ” in the late 1980s .
“ It did stop after she expressed dismay and very firmly pulled away , explaining that was not her style nor why she was there , ” Ms. Mills ’ statement read . “ He then said he remembered what she had on the day they had met some time earlier and that he had been attracted to her . Although she was able to defuse the situation , it did shake her up and she told friends about it as soon as she got home . They wanted her to report it but , she chose not to do so because it did stop . ”
The statement made no mention of when or where the incident allegedly occurred or the events leading up to that point . How the two came to know each other was only explained in that she met him through the “ course of her work. ” It said she didn ’ t report the incident because it stopped in that moment .
Ms. Mills is a former business partner and political donor of Mr. Renacci , Cleveland.com reported . Her statement came one day after the Republican told the Cincinnati Enquirer that he ’ d heard from “ multiple women ” with abuse allegations against Mr. Brown .
Mr. Brown issued a cease and desist letter to Mr. Renacci demanding he stop “ making unsubstantiated and false claims about something that never happened , ” or else he would face “ legal ramifications , ” campaign spokesman Preston Maddock said in a statement .
“ Just hours after a cease and desist was sent to Jim Renacci informing him that if he chose to continue making unsubstantiated and false claims about something that never happened he would face legal ramifications , now Jim Renacci ’ s former business partner and friend , in coordination with Renacci ’ s campaign , has put out a statement with nothing more than further anonymous and unsubstantiated claims , ” Mr. Maddock said , Cleveland.com reported . “ Pure and simple this is character assassination by a failed and desperate candidate who every day reaches new lows .

Mr. Brown leads Mr. Renacci by 16 points in the Ohio Senate race , according to the Real Clear Politics average of polls .","Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown is preparing to take legal action against his Republican challenger, Rep. Jim Renacci, after the congressman released a statement Thursday evening accusing him of sexual harassment 30 years ago.

Mr. Renacci’s Senate campaign released a lengthy statement by attorney Laura Mills telling the story of a “very credible” and “professional” unnamed woman who has accused Mr. Brown of making “an unexpected, uninvited, unwanted, and sudden advance, roughly pushing her up against a wall” in the late 1980s.

“It did stop after she expressed dismay and very firmly pulled away, explaining that was not her style nor why she was there,” Ms. Mills’ statement read. “He then said he remembered what she had on the day they had met some time earlier and that he had been attracted to her. Although she was able to defuse the situation, it did shake her up and she told friends about it as soon as she got home. They wanted her to report it but, she chose not to do so because it did stop.”

The statement made no mention of when or where the incident allegedly occurred or the events leading up to that point. How the two came to know each other was only explained in that she met him through the “course of her work.” It said she didn’t report the incident because it stopped in that moment.

Ms. Mills is a former business partner and political donor of Mr. Renacci, Cleveland.com reported. Her statement came one day after the Republican told the Cincinnati Enquirer that he’d heard from “multiple women” with abuse allegations against Mr. Brown.

Mr. Brown issued a cease and desist letter to Mr. Renacci demanding he stop “making unsubstantiated and false claims about something that never happened,” or else he would face “legal ramifications,” campaign spokesman Preston Maddock said in a statement.

“Just hours after a cease and desist was sent to Jim Renacci informing him that if he chose to continue making unsubstantiated and false claims about something that never happened he would face legal ramifications, now Jim Renacci’s former business partner and friend, in coordination with Renacci’s campaign, has put out a statement with nothing more than further anonymous and unsubstantiated claims,” Mr. Maddock said, Cleveland.com reported. “Pure and simple this is character assassination by a failed and desperate candidate who every day reaches new lows. This will not be tolerated, all legal means will be pursued against Jim Renacci.”

Mr. Renacci has used Mr. Brown’s contentious 1986 divorce and separate uncorroborated allegations of abuse as a way to paint Mr. Brown as hypocritical for voting “no” on confirming Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, who faced his own allegations of sexual misconduct.

Mr. Renacci said in a statement Thursday that this new allegation raises “even more questions and alarm over Mr. Brown’s conduct toward women.

Mr. Brown leads Mr. Renacci by 16 points in the Ohio Senate race, according to the Real Clear Politics average of polls.

The soul-searching over the Defense of Marriage Act went viral last week after Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman, a social conservative and original co-sponsor of the 1996 bill, sought out CNN to say something no one saw coming.

Portman said he'd decided to oppose DOMA and support same-sex marriage, two years after learning his college-age son was gay.

The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in two cases next week, including a challenge to DOMA's constitutionality. The federal law defines marriage as only between a man and a woman.

More than 4 in 5 members of Congress voted for that law, but some who did are having second thoughts. Most of them are Democrats.

Democratic Reversals

Bill Clinton signed DOMA into law but now wants it overturned. This week, his wife, former Democratic senator, secretary of state and first lady Hillary Clinton did her own about-face. Without actually mentioning DOMA, Clinton spoke on a gay-rights advocacy group's website, making it clear she no longer opposed same-sex couples getting married.

""They are full and equal citizens and deserve the rights of citizenship. That includes marriage. That's why I support marriage for lesbian and gay couples,"" she said.

That shift aligns Clinton not only with President Obama, who now backs gay marriage, but also with every one of the 15 sitting Senate Democrats who voted for DOMA in 1996 and now oppose it. One is Patty Murray of Washington state.

""My state voted, and I voted with them, to allow marriages between gay and lesbian couples. I'm very proud of my state,"" she says.

Dick Durbin, the Senate's No. 2 Democrat, says personal experiences changed his mind.

""I think about my colleague, Sen. Portman, and his family situation. Mine is not that, but it certainly reflects a lot of friends that I've become close to over the years who are now in committed relationships, good people, some raising children,"" Durbin says. ""I just felt at the end of the day, that this really is the civil rights question of our time.""

Unwavering Republicans

But of the Senate's 14 sitting Republicans who also voted for DOMA, only Portman no longer supports it. Arizona's John McCain, whose wife and daughter have campaigned for DOMA's repeal, still backs the law.

""I have conversations with my children all the time on this issue, and many other people, and I respect Sen. Portman's viewpoint,"" he says.

Yet, McCain says he has not changed his mind.

Ten Republican senators who voted for DOMA signed a brief urging the Supreme Court to uphold the law. The lead author is Utah's Orrin Hatch, who insists he's not so far apart from Portman.

""Look, both of us believe that we should not discriminate against anybody. But where we do part is that I believe ... in the traditional definition of marriage that has existed for, some estimate, 6,000 years,"" Hatch says.

Personal, Not Partisan

Though she's no longer in the Senate, Republican Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas has shifted her personal view of same-sex marriage.

""I certainly would vote to end it now. I think the time has come,"" she says.

Kassebaum voted for DOMA during her last year in the Senate, a time when no states recognized same-sex marriage.

Nine states and the District of Columbia do now. Kassebaum says it's time the federal government's laws acknowledged that reality, and that her fellow Republicans do the same.

""I'm sure people could say, 'Well yeah, right, she could say that, she isn't [in the Senate].' But I think it's personally the way I would feel,"" she says. ""And personally, I would feel it shouldn't be necessarily a Democrat issue or a Republican issue.""

Indeed, Portman says he described his decision to oppose DOMA as personal when he talked about it at a lunch this week with Senate GOP colleagues.

""I thanked them because I've had a number of people come up to me and express personal support for me and my family, and that's what I talked about,"" he says.

Portman says he isn't sure whether he will be the only Republican to reverse course.

""I really don't know. I didn't do this for political reasons, as you know, and I haven't really thought through the partisan politics of it,"" he says.

INDIANAPOLIS ( AP ) — Richard Lugar worked to alert Americans about the threat of terrorism years before “ weapons of mass destruction ” became a common phrase following the Sept. 11 attacks .
The longtime Republican senator from Indiana helped start a program that destroyed thousands of former Soviet nuclear and chemical weapons after the Cold War ended — then warned during a short-lived 1996 run for president about the danger of such devices falling into the hands of terrorists .
“ Every stockpile represents a theft opportunity for terrorists and a temptation for security personnel who might seek to profit by selling weapons on the black market , ” Lugar said in 2005 . “ We do not want the question posed the day after an attack on an American military base . ”
The soft-spoken and thoughtful former Rhodes Scholar was a leading Republican voice on foreign policy matters during his 36 years in the U.S. Senate , but whose reputation of working with Democrats ultimately cost him the office in 2012 . He died Sunday at age 87 at a hospital in Virginia , where he was being treated for a rare neurological disorder called chronic inflammatory demylinating polyneuropathy , or CIPD , the Lugar Center in Washington said in a statement .
Lugar ’ s long popularity in Indiana gave him the freedom to concentrate largely on foreign policy and national security matters — a focus highlighted by his collaboration with Democratic Sen. Sam Nunn on a program under which the United States paid to dismantle and secure thousands of nuclear warheads and missiles in the former Soviet states after the Cold War ended .
Lugar served for decades on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , twice as chairman , where he helped steer arms reduction pacts for the presidential administrations of George H.W . Bush , Bill Clinton and Barack Obama , supported an expansion of NATO and favored aid to Nicaragua ’ s Contra rebels .
“ Lugar was a leader not only in the Senate but also on the world stage , where he worked tirelessly to bring pressure to end apartheid in South Africa and enforce treaties that destroyed Soviet weapons of mass destruction , ” Vice President Mike Pence , a former governor of Indiana , said in a statement .
Another former governor , Purdue University President Mitch Daniels , who spent more than a decade as chief of staff to Lugar , said , “ The world is safer from nuclear danger because of him . And so many of us , while falling far short of the standards he set , are vastly better people because of him . ”
Lugar tried to translate his foreign policy expertise into a 1996 presidential run , where his slogan was “ nuclear security and fiscal sanity. ” But his campaign for the GOP nomination went badly from the start . His kickoff rally began just hours after the 1995 bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building , and he struggled to build name recognition and support .
“ He is not , nor does he try to be , a good ol ’ boy , ” Rex Early , a former state Republican chairman who worked on many of Lugar ’ s campaigns , said during the presidential run . “ He is not a back-pounder and doesn ’ t tell funny jokes and have a beer with the boys . ”
Lugar tried to counter questions about his demeanor , contending that the presidency is “ serious business . The presidency is not entertainment. ” He chafed at criticism that he was too straight , too smart , too dull .
“ I don ’ t know what that means , ” he said . “ Is it better to have someone stupid ? Or mediocre ? Or halfway there ? ”
He withdrew a year into the race after failing to win a single convention delegate , but not before foreshadowing the threat of terrorism that would become all too real on Sept. 11 , 2001 . Three of his television ads depicted mushroom clouds and warned of the growing danger of weapons of mass destruction in the hands of terrorist groups .
Republican Gov . Eric Holcomb directed flags across Indiana to be flown at half-staff to honor Lugar until his funeral , which had not yet been announced . He called Lugar “ an always faithful servant to the highest ideals in every walk of his incredible life . ”
Lugar ’ s time as a Washington foreign policy expert was the highlight of a political career that began with his election to the Indianapolis school board in the early 1960s . City GOP leaders encouraged him to run for mayor in 1967 .
He spent eight years at the city ’ s helm , leading the unification of Indianapolis and its suburban communities in Marion County , which solidified the city ’ s tax base and added so many Republican voters that Democrats weren ’ t able to win the mayor ’ s office again for more than 30 years . He was referred to as “ Richard Nixon ’ s favorite mayor ” for backing the move of federal programs to local governments . He also started efforts to revive the city ’ s downtown with construction of Market Square Arena , which in turn helped bring the Indiana Pacers into the NBA and spurred Indianapolis ’ development as a sports city .
He first ran for Senate in 1974 , narrowly losing to Sen. Birch Bayh in a Democratic landslide after the Watergate scandal . He ran again two years later and easily unseated three-term Democratic Sen. Vance Hartke , launching a 36-year Capitol Hill career that made him Indiana ’ s longest-serving senator .
He built a reputation as someone willing to work across the aisle and showed he could buck his party , notably with two major disagreements with President Ronald Reagan .
In 1986 , Reagan was inclined to accept the rigged election that would have kept Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos in office . But Lugar went to the islands as an election observer and said Reagan was misinformed . Lugar ’ s stand shifted U.S. support to the ultimate winner , Corazon Aquino , bringing down Marcos .
In another break with Reagan , Lugar pushed through Congress — over the president ’ s veto — the economic sanctions that Nelson Mandela said played a crucial role in overthrowing white minority rule in South Africa .
His foreign policy work didn ’ t sit well with everyone . Sen. Jesse Helms ousted him as the top Republican on the foreign relations committee in 1986 as being “ too internationalist . ”
At home , Lugar remained the Indiana GOP ’ s most popular figure , trouncing opponents with at least two-thirds of the vote in four straight elections . Democrats considered him so invincible that they didn ’ t nominate a challenger in 2006 .
He was the top Republican on the Senate ’ s Foreign Affairs Committee when he first worked with Obama , taking the then-Illinois senator with him to Russia , Ukraine and Azerbaijan in 2005 to visit weapon dismantlement sites . He then co-sponsored 2007 legislation with Obama on eliminating stockpiles of shoulder-fired missiles .
Obama frequently cited his work with Lugar during the 2008 presidential campaign as evidence of his bipartisanship and foreign policy experience . Lugar endorsed John McCain but didn ’ t distance himself from Obama at the time , saying “ I ’ m pleased that we had the association that Sen. Obama described . ”
That changed by Lugar ’ s 2012 re-election campaign . His tea party-backed challenger , Richard Mourdock , maintained that , “ Lugar has clearly lost his way on issues like our raising the debt limit , wasteful earmark spending and massive bailouts of private companies at taxpayer expense . ”
The attacks on his conservatism — combined with voter wariness about his age and long Washington tenure and questions about him not owning a home in Indiana since the late 1970s — led to Lugar ’ s first defeat since 1974 , as Mourdock grabbed 60 percent of the GOP primary vote .
In conceding defeat , Lugar said he knew some of his positions had been considered “ heretical ” by some , including his opposition to a ban on earmarks and support for immigration reform .
After Lugar ’ s defeat , Nunn , the Democratic senator with whom he worked on nuclear disarmament , suggested that many people may have misinterpreted Lugar ’ s positions as they accused him of being too liberal .
“ Dick Lugar never compromised his principles in anything we did together , nor did I , ” Nunn said at the time . “ We found ways to work together because we examined the facts and let the facts have a bearing on the conclusions , and I ’ m afraid in today ’ s political world too often people start with the conclusions and then hunt facts to justify them . ”
The Nunn-Lugar program led to about 7,600 Soviet nuclear warheads being deactivated and the destruction of more than 900 intercontinental ballistic missiles by the time Lugar left office , according to U.S. military figures . The program is credited with removing all nuclear weapons from the former Soviet republics of Kazakhstan , Ukraine and Belarus .
Born April 4 , 1932 , in Indianapolis , Lugar became an Eagle Scout and graduated at the top of his classes at both Indianapolis Shortridge High School and at Denison University in Ohio . At Denison , he met his future wife , Charlene . They married in 1956 and had four sons .
He was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University , and in 1956 he became a Navy officer , spending time as an intelligence aide for the chief of naval operations . He moved back to Indianapolis in 1960 to help run the family ’ s food machinery manufacturing business .

Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer vowed an all-out battle against Kavanaugh , but senators in his party can not block Kavanaugh ’ s confirmation if no Republicans break ranks . Trump ’ s fellow Republicans hold a 51-49 Senate majority , leaving them little margin for error .
Advocacy groups for and against Kavanaugh planned to spend millions of dollars in advertising to try to sway lawmakers .
The morning after being nominated by Trump for a lifetime seat on the nine-member conservative-majority court , Kavanaugh began making the rounds in the Senate , first visiting Republican leader Mitch McConnell and then Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley , whose panel will hold confirmation hearings .
Vice President Mike Pence , who holds a tie-breaking vote in the Senate , accompanied Kavanaugh to the meeting with McConnell .

We ’ ve got some due diligence , ” Murkowski told reporters .","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh visited top U.S. Senate Republicans on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, seeking to build support among lawmakers in what promises to be a contentious confirmation battle with Democrats.

Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer vowed an all-out battle against Kavanaugh, but senators in his party cannot block Kavanaugh’s confirmation if no Republicans break ranks. Trump’s fellow Republicans hold a 51-49 Senate majority, leaving them little margin for error.

Advocacy groups for and against Kavanaugh planned to spend millions of dollars in advertising to try to sway lawmakers.

The morning after being nominated by Trump for a lifetime seat on the nine-member conservative-majority court, Kavanaugh began making the rounds in the Senate, first visiting Republican leader Mitch McConnell and then Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, whose panel will hold confirmation hearings.

Vice President Mike Pence, who holds a tie-breaking vote in the Senate, accompanied Kavanaugh to the meeting with McConnell.

“We look forward to the confirmation process, which will unfold in the next few weeks,” McConnell said, ignoring a question about whether Democrats would support the nomination.

Kavanaugh, a conservative appeals court judge, did not respond to questions.

McConnell told reporters later in the day he hoped for a confirmation vote “sometime this fall.” Other Republicans said they hoped to confirm Kavanaugh before the court reconvenes in October.

Republicans want a speedy process to ensure the vote is held well before the Nov. 6 midterm elections in which all 435 seats in the House of Representatives and 35 of the 100 Senate seats are up for grabs, with Democrats trying to seize control of Congress.

“I will oppose this nominee with everything that I’ve got,” Schumer told MSNBC, warning that a more conservative court including Kavanaugh could overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling legalizing abortion and end protections under the Affordable Care Act healthcare law known as Obamacare.

Advocacy groups are targeting five senators as pivotal in the confirmation fight. Democrats plan to pressure two moderate Senate Republicans, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, to oppose the nomination. Both senators have been non-committal toward Kavanaugh’s nomination.

‘JUDICIAL TEMPERAMENT’

“He clearly is qualified for the job, but there are other issues involving judicial temperament and his judicial philosophy that also will play into my decision,” Collins told reporters.

Republicans will target three Democrats facing re-election in conservative states where Trump won big majorities in the 2016 election - Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Joe Donnelly of Indiana - to support Kavanaugh.

All three Democrats have touted their ability to work with Trump. They all voted last year to support Trump’s first Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, but have been non-committal on Kavanaugh. Kavanaugh is Trump’s second nominee, giving the president a chance to solidify conservative control of the court for years to come.

The unveiling of the 142-page bill marks the first time that the majority of senators get a look at the plan to overhaul America 's health care system . With Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pressing ahead for a vote next week , senators now only have a handful of days to decide whether to support or vote against the bill .
Four conservative Republican senators -- Rand Paul , Ted Cruz , Ron Johnson and Mike Lee -- said they opposed the current version . And key votes such as Sens . Dean Heller and Susan Collins have also withheld support .

President Donald Trump praised the bill Thursday -- though he acknowledged that changes were likely coming .
`` It 's going to be very good , '' Trump said at the White House . `` A little negotiation but it 's going to be very good . ''
With the exception of some key changes -- notably keeping Obamacare 's subsidies to help people pay for individual coverage -- the bill is similar to the version of the House measure that passed last month which Trump has since called `` mean '' despite having a Rose Garden celebration with House Republicans .
Democrats blasted the bill , using Trump 's `` mean '' judgment of the House bill .
`` The Senate bill needed heart , the way this bill cuts health care is heartless , '' said Minority Leader Chuck Schumer . `` This is a nasty bill and they 're trying to cover it up with little things here and there . ''

But it would allow states to waive the federal mandate on what insurers must cover , known as the essential health benefits . This would allow insurers to offer less comprehensive policies , so those with pre-existing conditions may not have all of their treatments covered .
Last-minute House concessions to conservatives would have allowed states to opt out of several protections for those with pre-existing conditions .
Medicaid : This has been one of the central sticking points in the debate .

However , conservatives also get some of what they want when it comes to overhauling the entire Medicaid program .

This would likely force states to cut enrollment , benefits or provider payments .
Premiums subsidies : The Senate bill would also largely maintain Obamacare 's premium subsidies structure , but tighten the eligibility criteria starting in 2020 . Fewer middle class folks would get help because only those earning up to 350 % of the poverty level would qualify , rather than the 400 % threshold contained in Obamacare . But it would also open up the subsidies to enrollees below the poverty level so those living in states that did n't expand Medicaid could get some assistance .

Planned Parenthood : As in the House bill , it would defund Planned Parenthood for one year .

It ’ s also true in one-point races . Welcome to Iowa , Kansas and North Carolina .
According to the latest round of Fox News Senate battleground polls , none of the front-runners in those states hits the 50 percent mark . That means these races will be decided by late-deciding voters -- and campaigns competing furiously to get their voters to the polls .
One thing that is baked into the cake : President Obama is unpopular in these states . That will motivate Republican voters , yet there ’ s more to these races -- and with four days until Election Day , a lot could happen .
Let ’ s start in Kansas , which has the most volatile Senate race .
No one was talking about Kansas when election season started . But everyone is now , as two long-time incumbents could get their walking papers Nov. 4 .
The new poll of Kansas likely voters finds independent Greg Orman has a one-point edge over Republican Sen. Pat Roberts : 44-43 percent . Three weeks ago , Roberts was up by five ( 44-39 percent ) .
Both candidates remain well below 50 percent , as Libertarian Randall Batson receives 3 percent , and another 9 percent is undecided or will vote for someone else .
The Democratic candidate , Chad Taylor , withdrew from the race Sept. 3 . Roberts was expected to win re-election until Taylor dropped out .
Still , many more Kansans identify as Republican than as Democrat . So why isn ’ t Roberts ahead ?
Orman has the edge not only because he captures the support of most Democrats , but also just over half of independents -- and more than a handful of Republicans to boot .
Eighty percent of Democrats back Orman . And nearly one in five Republicans go for him too ( 18 percent ) . Independents favor him by a margin of 51-26 percent .
Meanwhile , the incumbent is having trouble consolidating the base : only 76 percent of Republicans support Roberts , who has represented Kansas in the Senate since 1997 .
Interest in the election is up among Democrats : 66 percent were extremely or very interested earlier this month . That ’ s up to 74 percent now . Interest among Republicans held steady .
Eighty-nine percent of each candidate ’ s backers say they are certain to vote for their guy .
Orman has so far refused to say which party he would caucus with should he win . Most of his backers -- 75 percent -- want Democrats to retain control of the U.S. Senate , while 12 percent want Republicans to win .
Among Roberts ’ supporters , a huge 93 percent want Republicans to take control .
Overall , by 49-39 percent , Kansas likely voters want Republicans to win control of the Senate .
Roberts has a 5-point edge among men ( 47-42 percent ) , while Orman has a 7-point lead among women ( 46-39 percent ) .
Obama ’ s job performance rating is underwater by 17 points in Kansas , the worst rating of the three battleground states tested . Some 39 percent approve , while a 56-percent majority disapproves .
Among those undecided about their vote in the Senate race , 36 percent approve of Obama , while 40 percent disapprove and the remaining 24 percent are unsure .
The small already-voted group goes for Orman by 51-36 percent .
The new poll also finds Gov . Sam Brownback could be in trouble . Democratic challenger Paul Davis comes out on top : 48-42 percent .
Earlier this month , Brownback had a 6-point edge ( 46-40 ) , while in September Davis was up by 4 points ( 45-41 ) .
Brownback is hurt by a lack of party loyalty , as just 73 percent of Republicans support him and 20 percent back Davis .
An 89-percent majority of Democrats are voting for Davis and independents back him by 53-27 percent .
Republican Joni Ernst is up just 45-44 percent over Democrat Bruce Braley in the race to replace Iowa ’ s retiring Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin .
Both Ernst ( 94 percent ) and Braley supporters ( 95 percent ) have a high degree of vote certainty , and both candidates receive strong backing from their party faithful ( 89 percent and 90 percent respectively ) .
The reverse gender gap continues , as women are more likely to back Braley by 13 points , while more men support Ernst by 15 points .
Ernst is also helped by the fact that a 55-percent majority of Iowa likely voters disapproves of the job Obama is doing . Just 40 percent approve .
It ’ s a bad sign for Braley that undecided voters disapprove of Obama ’ s performance by a wide 25-point margin .
In addition , those who have already voted back Ernst by 61-31 percent .
There ’ s not much of a contest in the Iowa governor ’ s race , as incumbent Terry Branstad remains well ahead of his Democratic challenger Jack Hatch : 53 percent vs. 36 percent .
Branstad ’ s lead comes from overwhelming support from Republicans ( 91 percent ) . Plus , he gets 13 percent of Democrats and 63 percent of independents .
Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan is up by just 43-42 percent over Republican challenger Thom Tillis among North Carolina likely voters . That ’ s down from a 5-point edge last month , when she was up 41-36 percent ( Sept. 14-16 ) .
The incumbent Democrat ’ s lead widens to 55-31 percent among the small subgroup of voters who have already cast their ballot .
By 47-39 percent , women back Hagan . In 2008 , when Hagan won the seat , she received 55 percent of the vote among women ( Fox News exit poll ) . By 46-39 percent , men go for Tillis .
Eighty-six percent of Democrats back Hagan , while 84 percent of Republicans support Tillis . In a tight race , those couple of points matters .
Independents split 36-36 percent . In September they backed Tillis by 12 points .
White voters back Tillis by 51-34 percent . Black voters support Hagan by 84-3 percent .
A special note to election junkies : North Carolina polls close at 7:30 p.m . ET on election night and will provide early clues about which party will control the U.S. Senate . If Hagan ultimately loses , it will be a bad harbinger for Democrats .
`` If you think about the three Southern states in which Republicans are trying to knock off incumbent Democrats -- Arkansas , Louisiana and North Carolina -- Sen. Hagan is almost certainly the toughest 'out ' for the GOP , '' says Republican pollster Daron Shaw , who jointly conducts the Fox News poll with Democratic pollster Chris Anderson .
More voters think Hagan agrees with Obama too often ( 48 percent ) than think Tillis is too conservative on the issues ( 35 percent ) . In fact , they are more than twice as likely to say Tillis is not conservative enough ( 13 percent ) than that Hagan doesn ’ t agree with Obama often enough ( 5 percent ) .
At 42 percent approval , President Obama receives his best job rating in North Carolina of the states polled ( 54 percent disapprove ) .
Among Tillis supporters , 92 percent feel certain they will vote for him , while 88 percent of Hagan supporters say the same .
So , that ’ s enough about midterm elections . Let ’ s talk about the race everyone also wants to really talk about : 2016 !
In Iowa , the first hurdle to the White House , Democrats prefer Hillary Clinton . By a lot : 62 percent want her to be the nominee . She ’ s followed by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren at 14 and Vice President Joe Biden at 10 percent .
For the GOP nominee , Republican likely voters are spreading their support around . In the low double digits are former Arkansas Gov . Mike Huckabee ( 13 percent ) and author Ben Carson ( 12 percent ) . They are closely followed by Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan ( 9 percent ) , former Florida Gov . Jeb Bush ( 8 percent ) and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul ( 8 percent ) . Both New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz receive 7 percent , former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum comes in at 6 percent , and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Wisconsin Gov . Scott Walker receive 5 percent .
In Ohio , a virtual must-win state in presidential elections , Clinton tops each of the Republican challengers tested .
The closest hypothetical matchup is between Clinton and Ohio Gov . John Kasich . She bests him by just 3 points among Ohio voters : 47-43 percent .
Clinton also tops Christie by 7 points , Paul by 9 points , and both Jeb Bush and Texas Gov . Rick Perry by 10 points .
Gov . Kasich is poised to win re-election easily , as the poll finds he leads Democratic challenger Edward FitzGerald by 15 points ( 51-36 percent ) .
The Fox News Poll is conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research ( D ) and Shaw & Company Research ( R ) . The polls were conducted Oct. 28-30 , 2014 , by telephone ( landline and cell phone ) with live interviewers among a random sample of likely voters in Iowa ( 911 ) , Kansas ( 907 ) , North Carolina ( 909 ) and Ohio ( 803 ) . Results based on the full sample in each state have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points .","“It all comes down to turnout.”

That’s one of the biggest clichés in politics. It’s also true in one-point races. Welcome to Iowa, Kansas and North Carolina.

According to the latest round of Fox News Senate battleground polls, none of the front-runners in those states hits the 50 percent mark. That means these races will be decided by late-deciding voters -- and campaigns competing furiously to get their voters to the polls.

One thing that is baked into the cake: President Obama is unpopular in these states. That will motivate Republican voters, yet there’s more to these races -- and with four days until Election Day, a lot could happen.

Let’s start in Kansas, which has the most volatile Senate race.

Kansas

No one was talking about Kansas when election season started. But everyone is now, as two long-time incumbents could get their walking papers Nov. 4.

The new poll of Kansas likely voters finds independent Greg Orman has a one-point edge over Republican Sen. Pat Roberts: 44-43 percent. Three weeks ago, Roberts was up by five (44-39 percent).

Click here for the poll results.

Both candidates remain well below 50 percent, as Libertarian Randall Batson receives 3 percent, and another 9 percent is undecided or will vote for someone else.

The Democratic candidate, Chad Taylor, withdrew from the race Sept. 3. Roberts was expected to win re-election until Taylor dropped out.

Still, many more Kansans identify as Republican than as Democrat. So why isn’t Roberts ahead?

Orman has the edge not only because he captures the support of most Democrats, but also just over half of independents -- and more than a handful of Republicans to boot.

Eighty percent of Democrats back Orman. And nearly one in five Republicans go for him too (18 percent). Independents favor him by a margin of 51-26 percent.

Meanwhile, the incumbent is having trouble consolidating the base: only 76 percent of Republicans support Roberts, who has represented Kansas in the Senate since 1997.

Interest in the election is up among Democrats: 66 percent were extremely or very interested earlier this month. That’s up to 74 percent now. Interest among Republicans held steady.

Eighty-nine percent of each candidate’s backers say they are certain to vote for their guy.

Orman has so far refused to say which party he would caucus with should he win. Most of his backers -- 75 percent -- want Democrats to retain control of the U.S. Senate, while 12 percent want Republicans to win.

Among Roberts’ supporters, a huge 93 percent want Republicans to take control.

Overall, by 49-39 percent, Kansas likely voters want Republicans to win control of the Senate.

Roberts has a 5-point edge among men (47-42 percent), while Orman has a 7-point lead among women (46-39 percent).

Obama’s job performance rating is underwater by 17 points in Kansas, the worst rating of the three battleground states tested. Some 39 percent approve, while a 56-percent majority disapproves.

Among those undecided about their vote in the Senate race, 36 percent approve of Obama, while 40 percent disapprove and the remaining 24 percent are unsure.

The small already-voted group goes for Orman by 51-36 percent.

The new poll also finds Gov. Sam Brownback could be in trouble. Democratic challenger Paul Davis comes out on top: 48-42 percent.

Earlier this month, Brownback had a 6-point edge (46-40), while in September Davis was up by 4 points (45-41).

Brownback is hurt by a lack of party loyalty, as just 73 percent of Republicans support him and 20 percent back Davis.

An 89-percent majority of Democrats are voting for Davis and independents back him by 53-27 percent.

Iowa

Republican Joni Ernst is up just 45-44 percent over Democrat Bruce Braley in the race to replace Iowa’s retiring Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin.

Both Ernst (94 percent) and Braley supporters (95 percent) have a high degree of vote certainty, and both candidates receive strong backing from their party faithful (89 percent and 90 percent respectively).

Click here for the poll results.

Independents prefer Ernst over Braley by 46-30 percent.

The reverse gender gap continues, as women are more likely to back Braley by 13 points, while more men support Ernst by 15 points.

Ernst is also helped by the fact that a 55-percent majority of Iowa likely voters disapproves of the job Obama is doing. Just 40 percent approve.

It’s a bad sign for Braley that undecided voters disapprove of Obama’s performance by a wide 25-point margin.

In addition, those who have already voted back Ernst by 61-31 percent.

There’s not much of a contest in the Iowa governor’s race, as incumbent Terry Branstad remains well ahead of his Democratic challenger Jack Hatch: 53 percent vs. 36 percent.

Branstad’s lead comes from overwhelming support from Republicans (91 percent). Plus, he gets 13 percent of Democrats and 63 percent of independents.

North Carolina

Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan is up by just 43-42 percent over Republican challenger Thom Tillis among North Carolina likely voters. That’s down from a 5-point edge last month, when she was up 41-36 percent (Sept. 14-16).

The incumbent Democrat’s lead widens to 55-31 percent among the small subgroup of voters who have already cast their ballot.

By 47-39 percent, women back Hagan. In 2008, when Hagan won the seat, she received 55 percent of the vote among women (Fox News exit poll). By 46-39 percent, men go for Tillis.

Eighty-six percent of Democrats back Hagan, while 84 percent of Republicans support Tillis. In a tight race, those couple of points matters.

Independents split 36-36 percent. In September they backed Tillis by 12 points.

White voters back Tillis by 51-34 percent. Black voters support Hagan by 84-3 percent.

A special note to election junkies: North Carolina polls close at 7:30 p.m. ET on election night and will provide early clues about which party will control the U.S. Senate. If Hagan ultimately loses, it will be a bad harbinger for Democrats.

""If you think about the three Southern states in which Republicans are trying to knock off incumbent Democrats -- Arkansas, Louisiana and North Carolina -- Sen. Hagan is almost certainly the toughest 'out' for the GOP,"" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who jointly conducts the Fox News poll with Democratic pollster Chris Anderson.

More voters think Hagan agrees with Obama too often (48 percent) than think Tillis is too conservative on the issues (35 percent). In fact, they are more than twice as likely to say Tillis is not conservative enough (13 percent) than that Hagan doesn’t agree with Obama often enough (5 percent).

At 42 percent approval, President Obama receives his best job rating in North Carolina of the states polled (54 percent disapprove).

Among Tillis supporters, 92 percent feel certain they will vote for him, while 88 percent of Hagan supporters say the same.



2016 Presidential Election

So, that’s enough about midterm elections. Let’s talk about the race everyone also wants to really talk about: 2016!

In Iowa, the first hurdle to the White House, Democrats prefer Hillary Clinton. By a lot: 62 percent want her to be the nominee. She’s followed by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren at 14 and Vice President Joe Biden at 10 percent.

For the GOP nominee, Republican likely voters are spreading their support around. In the low double digits are former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee (13 percent) and author Ben Carson (12 percent). They are closely followed by Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan (9 percent), former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (8 percent) and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul (8 percent). Both New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz receive 7 percent, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum comes in at 6 percent, and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker receive 5 percent.

In Ohio, a virtual must-win state in presidential elections, Clinton tops each of the Republican challengers tested.

The closest hypothetical matchup is between Clinton and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. She bests him by just 3 points among Ohio voters: 47-43 percent.

Click here for the poll results.

Clinton also tops Christie by 7 points, Paul by 9 points, and both Jeb Bush and Texas Gov. Rick Perry by 10 points.

Gov. Kasich is poised to win re-election easily, as the poll finds he leads Democratic challenger Edward FitzGerald by 15 points (51-36 percent).

The Fox News Poll is conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R). The polls were conducted Oct. 28-30, 2014, by telephone (landline and cell phone) with live interviewers among a random sample of likely voters in Iowa (911), Kansas (907), North Carolina (909) and Ohio (803).

WASHINGTON — Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake is leaving Congress because the kind of conservatism he champions no longer seems welcome in Steve Bannon's GOP.

Flake, one of the few senators willing to speak up against President Trump, said Tuesday he would not seek re-election. He was facing a tough primary challenge from Kelli Ward, a populist who already had secured the backing of Bannon, Trump's former chief strategist.

“It is clear at this moment that a traditional conservative who believes in limited government and free markets, who is devoted to free trade, who is pro-immigration has a narrower and narrower path to nomination in the Republican Party,” Flake said on the Senate floor Tuesday, in announcing he would not be seeking another term. Later, Flake said to reporters, “if I could run the kind of race I'd like to run and believe I could win a Republican primary, I might go forward.”

Before being elected to the Senate in 2012, Flake had served six terms in the House, where he built a reputation as a crusader against wasteful government spending. He built a reliable conservative voting record — the American Conservative Union gave him a 93% lifetime rating — but his criticism of the president had alienated many of Arizona’s far-right voters, the very voters most likely to show up for midterm primaries.

Trump was not timid in punching back at Flake, saying over the summer that he was ""weak on borders"" and ""toxic.""

Flake became a key target of Bannon and his band of anti-establishment allies, who have vowed to put up candidates against any senator — in either party — who was hampering Trump’s agenda or was too close to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.

Bannon, who was a senior adviser to Trump until this summer when he returned to his post as the head of Breitbart News, even flew down to Arizona for a campaign rally for Ward last week.

“Today Steve Bannon and the entire Trump movement added another scalp to his collection and other Never Trump incumbents should be very nervous right now,” Andrew Surabian, a senior adviser for the pro-Trump advocacy organization Great America Alliance and a close ally of Bannon’s, told USA TODAY shortly after the announcement.

“Arizona voters are the big winner in @JeffFlake's decision to not seek reelection. They deserve a strong, conservative in the Senate,” Ward tweeted after the announcement. “Who supports @POTUS & the 'America First' agenda. Our campaign proudly offers an optimistic path forward for Arizona & America #MAGA” she continued.

Why Sen. Jeff Flake says he won't run for re-election to the Senate

Danny Tarkanian, the anti-establishment Republican whom Bannon has indicated support for and who is running against GOP Sen. Dean Heller in Nevada, was invigorated by the news.

“It will be interesting to see whether Heller decides to follow the Corker-Flake model or the Luther Strange model. Either way he will not be the Republican nominee,” Tarkanian told USA TODAY. Strange is a sitting senator from Alabama who was endorsed by GOP leadership and Trump but was defeated last month in the GOP primary by Judge Roy Moore, a controversial candidate endorsed by Bannon.

When Flake was asked by reporters what his response was to the Bannon wing claiming victory after his announcement, he responded: ""Nothing at all.""

Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, another lawmaker who is retiring at the end of his term and has battled with Trump, said Flake ""is kind of quiet but he stands for all the things that have made our nation great and he’s willing to continue to say that even though we have demagogues and others who end up trying to take us in other directions.”

Flake's departure may just be a signal that some people cannot compete in the new Republican political climate.

“Most incumbents are realizing that the old ways of doing things, aren’t going to work anymore. The old ways of raising money and doing TV ads isn’t going to work,” said Adam Brandon, president of the conservative advocacy group FreedomWorks. Brandon said that while Flake’s voting record had always been good with FreedomWorks, he thought the Arizona senator was “too close to the swamp.”

us_senate,American Spectator,2,https://spectator.org/why-mitch-mcconnell-moved-on-from-moving-on-on-health-care/,Why Mitch McConnell Moved On From ‘Moving On’ on Health Care,,"Daniel J. Flynn, David Catron, John Jiang, Dominick Sansone, Ross Kaminsky, Brandon J. Weichert","Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell not only failed to whip up enough votes to replace Obamacare last week but achieved the same negative result when he shifted to a straight-up repeal as well . He lost by forfeit without counting a single vote .
The failure coming with a Republican occupying the White House , Republicans enjoying majorities in both houses of Congress , and Republican nominees outnumbering their Democratic colleagues on the Supreme Court struck as especially bitter .
When President Trump tweeted , “ The Republicans never discuss how good their healthcare bill is , ” many observed that it struck a strange contrast with his characterization of an earlier incarnation of the bill as “ mean. ” But it said something correct atop the contradiction .
Nobody sold the Better Care Reconciliation Act to the American people the way Barack Obama sold the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act . Sure , President Obama channeled Harold Hill when pushing his signature legislation . But at least he aggressively made his case . Neither Trump nor McConnell full-throatedly drummed up popular support for their bill . Just 12 percent of the public supported it .
The Senate bill failed in part because few knew what it contained and in part because what it contained impressed very few who knew .
The adage “ you can ’ t beat something with nothing ” applies as much to the replace effort as it does to the repeal attempt . The Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017 , despite its 172-pages , manages very little in the way of substantial reform regarding the health-care mess exacerbated by Obamacare but not caused by it . It tweaks without ambition of a turnaround .
The replace legislation wisely allowed all Americans the option to purchase simple , low-deductible , high-premium catastrophic plans that tend to act as a check on out-of-control spending .

This is why Senator McConnell , in opening up debate on healthcare and holding votes this week , moved on from “ moving on . ”","Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell not only failed to whip up enough votes to replace Obamacare last week but achieved the same negative result when he shifted to a straight-up repeal as well. He lost by forfeit without counting a single vote.

The failure coming with a Republican occupying the White House, Republicans enjoying majorities in both houses of Congress, and Republican nominees outnumbering their Democratic colleagues on the Supreme Court struck as especially bitter.

If not now, when?

When President Trump tweeted, “The Republicans never discuss how good their healthcare bill is,” many observed that it struck a strange contrast with his characterization of an earlier incarnation of the bill as “mean.” But it said something correct atop the contradiction.

Nobody sold the Better Care Reconciliation Act to the American people the way Barack Obama sold the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Sure, President Obama channeled Harold Hill when pushing his signature legislation. But at least he aggressively made his case. Neither Trump nor McConnell full-throatedly drummed up popular support for their bill. Just 12 percent of the public supported it.

The Senate bill failed in part because few knew what it contained and in part because what it contained impressed very few who knew.

The adage “you can’t beat something with nothing” applies as much to the replace effort as it does to the repeal attempt. The Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017, despite its 172-pages, manages very little in the way of substantial reform regarding the health-care mess exacerbated by Obamacare but not caused by it. It tweaks without ambition of a turnaround.

The replace legislation wisely allowed all Americans the option to purchase simple, low-deductible, high-premium catastrophic plans that tend to act as a check on out-of-control spending. It essentially repealed the individual and employer mandates that worked as a gift to the insurance companies but not to consumers. It block-granted some Medicaid funding to states and capped per-person spending within the program as a means to control costs. It allowed individuals to use medical savings accounts to pay for premiums.

Alas, the Better Care Reconciliation Act continues to force plans to cover medical options deemed essential by politicians but neither wanted nor needed by consumers. The Senate replaces Obama’s subsidies with their tax credits. In reforming Medicaid over a period of years, the bill provides much wiggle room to allow those reforms to not occur. The Senate plan allocates tens of billions of dollars to bribe health insurance companies to continue to offer plans in unprofitable state markets.

In the wake of the exodus of insurers from Iowa, Wisconsin, and other markets, the Senate health bill spends money equaling or exceeding the budgets of Iowa, Wisconsin, and other state governments to reverse that exodus. The bill reads,

The Iowa Republican ’ s effort is the first new official inquiry of Clinton since her unexpected loss in the 2016 presidential election to President Donald Trump . Trump ’ s supporters often chanted “ lock her up ” during his many boisterous campaign rallies .
But upon assuming the presidency , Trump and leaders of the Republican-majority Congress displayed little appetite for reopening investigations of Clinton ’ s tenure as the chief U.S. diplomat and multiple persistent allegations of “ pay-to-play ” corruption involving the Clinton Foundation . Until now .
███ News Foundation ( TheDCNF ) Investigative Group exclusively reported in May that Clinton sent top U.S. diplomats to pressure Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheik Hasina and her son Sajeeb Wazed in an effort to kill that country ’ s corruption investigation of Yunus and Grameen Bank . Yunus was then managing director of the state-owned Bangladesh bank .
In a June 1 , 2017 , letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson , Grassley repeated TheDCNF charge that Clinton threatened Wazed with an IRS tax audit if his mother did not back away from the corruption probe . Wazed has lived in the U.S. for 17 years .
“ If the Secretary of State used her position to intervene in an independent investigation by a sovereign government simply because of a personal and financial relationship stemming from the Clinton Foundation rather than the legitimate foreign policy interests of the United States , then that would be unacceptable , ” Grassley told Tillerson .
“ Co-mingling her official position as Secretary of State with her family foundation would be similarly inappropriate . It is vital to determine whether the State Department had any role in the threat of an IRS audit against the son of the Prime Minister in retaliation for this investigation , ” Grassley continued .
Grassley described how U.S. ambassadors James Moriarty and Dan Mozena , as well as Jon Danilowica , the Deputy Chief of Mission , met with Wazed in the U.S. Embassy in Dhaka , Bangladesh ’ s capital , on numerous occasions while the corruption investigation was underway . All three are career diplomats .
Another official , U.S. Agency for International Development ( USAID ) Administrator Rajiv Shah also met with Wazed . Shah ’ s agency awarded $ 13 million to Yunus organizations and another $ 11 million to allied Yunus organizations during Clinton ’ s tenure . The Department of State oversees USAID programs .
As TheDCNF previously reported , Clinton ’ s aid to Yunus included 18 grants , contracts and loans awarded to two of his America-based foundations , the Grameen Foundation USA and Grameen America , according to USASpending.gov .
Yunus was stripped of his directorship of the state owned Grameen Bank in 2011 as a result of the Bangladesh government ’ s review of his financial mismanagement of the bank and its “ micro-credit ” loan program for poor peasants , mainly women .
A Norwegian documentary charging Yunus personally diverted $ 100 million intended for Grameen Bank and for the poor to his other organizations triggered the initial investigation against him . The pocketing of funds shocked many in poverty-stricken Bangladesh where the annual per capita income is about $ 3,600 , according to the World Bank .
Yunus eventually returned the money to Grameen Bank , but the government ’ s investigation exposed serious financial mismanagement and found the micro-loan program failed to lift recipients out of poverty . He was forced to resign under a law making 60 the maximum age for the bank ’ s top position . Yunus was 70 at the time .
Interest rates and payback amounts of the micro-loans sometimes resulted in more poverty , not less . Rather than re-paying the loans , a number of recipients in Bangladesh and India committed suicide .
Clinton ’ s support for Yunus dates to former President Bill Clinton ’ s years as Arkansas governor . Both Clintons became micro-credit loan advocates and enthusiastic backers of Yunus , who invented the lending scheme . Bill Clinton reportedly lobbied the Nobel Prize Committee on behalf of Yunus . The committee awarded him the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize .
From 2008 onward , Yunus was a featured speaker at the glitzy Clinton Global Initiative ’ s annual meeting . He donated between $ 100,000- $ 250,000 to CGI and $ 25,000- $ 50,000 to the Clinton Foundation , according to the Clinton Foundation website .
Wazed told TheDCNF it was “ astounding and mind boggling ” to him that between 2010 and 2012 senior State Department officials repeatedly pressured him to influence his mother to drop the Grameen Bank investigation .
“ They threatened me with the possibility of an audit by the Internal Revenue Service , ” Wazed said . “ They would say over and over again , ‘ Yunus has powerful friends ’ and we all knew they were talking of Secretary Clinton . Everybody knew it was Mrs. Clinton . ”
Grassley noted in his letter to Tillerson that Wazed recounted for Senate investigators “ two conversations with then-Deputy Chief of Mission to Bangladesh Jon Danilowicz during which Danilowicz mentioned that Wazed may be audited by the IRS if he failed to use his influence to get his mother to drop the investigation into Yunus . ”
Grassley added new details stating , “ Furthermore , he was told by these same officials that Yunus was communicating with Secretary Clinton and her staff for assistance and , in turn , Secretary Clinton ’ s staff put pressure on the Embassy in Bangladesh to intercede on Yunus ’ behalf . ”
The World Bank also unexpectedly decided during Clinton ’ s tenure in 2012 to rescind a $ 1.2 billion loan to Bangladesh while the IRS was pressuring Wazed . The funds were sought to build a key bridge near Dhaka .
Clinton ’ s inner circle of State Department aides kept her apprised of developments throughout the probe . When Clinton confident Melanne Verveer told her of Yunus ’ resignation on May 14 , 2011 , the former secretary of state described it as “ sad indeed . ”
In 2016 , Grassley complained about the Clinton Foundation to former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and to the FBI regarding public corruption charges . However , this is the first time since Trump took office that Grassley renewed an investigation into Clinton , this time for her retaliatory actions against Bangladesh on behalf of Yunus .
Grassley requested that Tillerson provide the judicial panel with all related emails and State Department records or communications by June 15 . The senator also asked if the matter had been referred to the Department of Justice or the State Department ’ s Inspector General . “ If not , why not ? ” Grassley asked Tillerson .

Biden’s accuser said that she “absolutely” would go under oath and subject herself to cross examination. Kelly then asked if Reade would want to take a polygraph.

“I’m not a criminal,” Reade responded. “Joe Biden should take the polygraph. What kind of precedent does that set for survivors of violence? Does that mean we’re presumed guilty and we all have to take polygraphs?”

“So, I will take one if Joe Biden takes one. But I’m not a criminal.”

This comment came after Kelly noted that Christine Blasey Ford, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s accuser, agreed to be cross-examined regarding her allegations. Kelly said that this has been cited for some of those who believed Ford and don’t believe Reade.

Ford testified under oath regarding her allegations, subjected herself to cross examination and participated in a polygraph test administered by someone on her team, according to Kelly.

Kelly also asked if Reade thinks that “we should believe all women.” Reade said she believed Ford and others who have come forward with allegations of sexual assault. Reade added that “there needs to be a conversation rather than a hashtag.”

“Are you in favor of the conversation, I mean, does Joe Biden get due process? Does he get the chance to vet these claims and defend himself, is that okay?” Kelly asked.

“I think he’s been doing that,” Reade responded. “Right? He’s had a chance for more platforms than I have.” (RELATED: It Took 37 Days For Media To Ask Joe Biden About Tara Reade’s Sexual Assault Accusation)

One of the controversial subjects Trump alluded to in his conversation with Zelensky was an allegation that a Russia-orchestrated hacking of the Democratic National Committee in 2016 was conducted in Ukraine . There has been little evidence to substantiate that claim .
Johnson sees Trump ’ s interest in Biden ’ s Ukraine connections and Ukraine ’ s alleged role in meddling in the 2016 election as legitimate law enforcement interests .
GOP leaders have sought to tamp down criticism of Trump from their ranks , mindful that that unity among rank-and-file members is crucial to maintaining their political strength , a point that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison ( Mitch ) Mitchell McConnellGOP senators balk at lengthy impeachment trial Graham : Senate trial 'must expose the whistleblower ' Graham says Schiff should be a witness in Trump impeachment trial MORE ( R-Ky. ) frequently makes to colleagues .

The White House in recent days has worked closely to coordinate its defense with allies on Capitol Hill .
A White House aide accidentally sent a copy of its talking point for Republican lawmakers to Democratic offices on Wednesday .
The document argued that Trump made no quid-pro-quo request to Zelensky and discussed Biden only after Zelensky initiated the conversation about corruption-related issues .
The talking points also shifted scrutiny to the whistleblower by arguing the “ real scandal ” was that Trump ’ s confidential conversation with a foreign leader was leaked to the press .
The document reflected Johnson ’ s argument that it was proper for Trump to ask a foreign leader to investigate any connection between his country and attempted interference in the 2016 election .
Republicans strategists acknowledge their prospects in the 2020 election , when control of the Senate as well as the White House and House will be up for grabs , are closely tied to Trump ’ s .

Ernst has said the investigation of the whistleblower ’ s complaint should be handled on a bipartisan basis by the Senate Intelligence Committee .
Another GOP tactic has been to portray the Democrats as dead-set on impeachment regardless of what any investigation of the whistleblower ’ s complaint turns up .

One of the controversial subjects Trump alluded to in his conversation with Zelensky was an allegation that a Russia-orchestrated hacking of the Democratic National Committee in 2016 was conducted in Ukraine. There has been little evidence to substantiate that claim.

Johnson sees Trump’s interest in Biden’s Ukraine connections and Ukraine’s alleged role in meddling in the 2016 election as legitimate law enforcement interests.

GOP leaders have sought to tamp down criticism of Trump from their ranks, mindful that that unity among rank-and-file members is crucial to maintaining their political strength, a point that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellGOP senators balk at lengthy impeachment trial Graham: Senate trial 'must expose the whistleblower' Graham says Schiff should be a witness in Trump impeachment trial MORE (R-Ky.) frequently makes to colleagues.

Graham, one of Trump’s staunchest allies, told reporters on Wednesday that Romney was the only senator to voice concerns about Trump’s conduct at a private lunch meeting of the Senate Republican Steering Committee.

The White House in recent days has worked closely to coordinate its defense with allies on Capitol Hill.

A White House aide accidentally sent a copy of its talking point for Republican lawmakers to Democratic offices on Wednesday.

The document argued that Trump made no quid-pro-quo request to Zelensky and discussed Biden only after Zelensky initiated the conversation about corruption-related issues.

The talking points also shifted scrutiny to the whistleblower by arguing the “real scandal” was that Trump’s confidential conversation with a foreign leader was leaked to the press.

The document reflected Johnson’s argument that it was proper for Trump to ask a foreign leader to investigate any connection between his country and attempted interference in the 2016 election.

Republicans strategists acknowledge their prospects in the 2020 election, when control of the Senate as well as the White House and House will be up for grabs, are closely tied to Trump’s.

A Republican strategist working on a congressional campaign in Iowa said that, for example, while Sen.

Ernst has said the investigation of the whistleblower’s complaint should be handled on a bipartisan basis by the Senate Intelligence Committee.

Another GOP tactic has been to portray the Democrats as dead-set on impeachment regardless of what any investigation of the whistleblower’s complaint turns up.

This line of argument has been spearheaded by McConnell.

“We know that House Democrats have been indulging in their impeachment obsession for nearly three years now, a never-ending impeachment parade in search of a rationale,” he said on the Senate floor the morning after Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiOvernight Health Care: Trump officials making changes to drug pricing proposal | House panel advances flavored e-cig ban | Senators press FDA tobacco chief on vaping ban Speaker Pelosi, it's time to throw American innovators a lifeline Why Americans must tune in to the Trump impeachment hearings MORE (D-Calif.) announced the launch of a formal impeachment inquiry.

No agreements, but senators of both parties offer positive words

The President ""rejected"" House GOP proposal, Republican lawmaker says

House Republicans have been sidelined

Congressional negotiators had no agreements to report Saturday, but they issued positive reports on their talks to end a partial government shutdown and avert a default on government debt.

""Cordial"" was the word Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, used to describe his ""preliminary"" discussions with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.

""Good"" discussions were going on among Senate leaders, said Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, ""so I think all of us want to support those efforts, and hopefully they bear fruit over the weekend.""

For all the positive talk, the only actions Saturday fell into the ""no"" category:

--Republican leaders said President Barack Obama rejected their proposal for a six-week debt limit extension.

--The Senate defeated a procedural measure to extend the debt limit with no strings attached.

--Reid said a proposal by a bipartisan group of senators, led by Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, is no longer on the table because it treated opening the government as a ""concession.""

Reid continues to demand that any plan include a ""clean"" bill with no strings attached that raises the debt limit and reopens the government.

Countdown to default

The Treasury Department says it will be unable to pay the government's bills unless the debt limit is increased by Thursday. The partial shutdown of government services has been in effect since October 1.

Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, said Saturday the consequences of a failure to raise the debt limit would be dire for economies around the world. She spoke to CNN's Richard Quest at an Institute of International Finance conference in Washington.

""You know, I've just spent the last two days with representatives of about 188 countries around the world. I wouldn't say they are confident. I would say they are concerned, and they are very anxious to see this crisis resolved, because they know it's going to impact on their economy,"" Lagarde said.

Senate Democrats meet with president

Senate Democrats met with Obama for 75 minutes Saturday afternoon. A Senate Democratic leadership aide said the party is unified.

""Democrats are willing to negotiate on anything Republicans want to discuss as soon as we reopen the government and pay our bills,"" said the aide.

Another Democratic source said party leaders regard Republicans as lacking a coherent position. They hope McConnell can ""cut through the clutter,"" the source told CNN's Dana Bash.

The sources, who are familiar with the talks, spoke on the condition of anonymity so they could speak candidly.

Despite the lack of agreement, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said progress was being made.

""I think our Republican colleagues are moving in our direction with the fact that Obamacare is not a major part of the discussion anymore among most all Senate and many House Republicans,"" he said.

No votes on Sunday

Before the White House meeting, the Senate's second highest-ranking Democrat, Richard Durbin of Illinois, told CNN's Deirdre Walsh that Democrats hoped to reach agreement with Republican negotiators before stock markets open Monday.

Even if that optimistic timetable could be met, a deal could not be voted upon Sunday.

The Senate is scheduled to come back into session at 1 p.m. ET Sunday, but no votes are planned and Senators have been told their presence is not required. The House is not scheduled to meet until Monday afternoon.

Even as he demanded a ""clean"" bill, Reid said it was encouraging that McConnell had approached him to start their weekend talks.

""I hope that our talking is some solace to the American people and the world,"" Reid said. He said McConnell had approached him. ""This hasn't happened until now,"" Reid said.

Obama-Boehner talks stall

Republican leadership told the Republican caucus during a Saturday morning meeting that the president will not accept their proposal to raise the debt limit for six weeks.

Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, told CNN Saturday that ""the President rejected our deal.""

The standstill came after a Friday afternoon phone call between Boehner and Obama in which they decided to keep talking.

Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Illinois, said the President is waiting for a better offer.

""It doesn't seem like the White House is serious at all about entering negotiations with us until they see what comes out of the Senate. If they get something out of the Senate that's weaker than our negotiated position, it obviously strengthens their position,"" Kinzinger said.

Susan Rice? Not So Much,2017-05-08,Philip Ewing,"Sally Yates To Testify In Russia Hearing . Susan Rice ? Not So Much
A Senate hearing Monday on Russian meddling in the 2016 election is expected to feature two powerful Washington women , one of whom will be in the room — and one of whom will not .
Former acting U.S. Attorney General Sally Yates and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper , both of whom served under President Barack Obama , are set to appear before South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham 's crime and terrorism subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee .
But Graham and his fellow Republicans also may focus heavily on former national security adviser Susan Rice , who declined to appear .
Democrats want Yates to describe what she told White House officials shortly after President Trump 's inauguration about the FBI 's investigation into then-national security adviser Michael Flynn . Yates ' Jan. 26 meeting in the executive mansion reportedly was to notify the administration that the FBI believed Flynn could be vulnerable to Russian blackmail . He resigned weeks later .
A former member of the Obama administration says that was n't Trump 's first caution about Flynn . The former official says Obama gave then-President-elect Trump a warning about Flynn , based on his job performance as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency . Flynn ran that agency for two years during the Obama administration but was fired , reportedly over management issues .
White House press secretary Sean Spicer confirmed that Obama `` made it clear that he was not a fan of Gen. Flynn 's '' but suggested that could be interpreted as `` bad blood '' motivated by Flynn 's criticisms of Obama , rather than a substantive warning .
`` If President Obama was truly concerned , why did n't he suspend Gen. Flynn 's security clearance ? '' Spicer asked at a press conference Monday .
Since his brief tenure as Trump 's national security adviser , Flynn has offered to tell his story to congressional committees in exchange for immunity from prosecution — an offer that so far no one has accepted .
Trump fired Yates , who had continued serving into his administration before he had nominated his own attorney general , in late January over another controversy .
Graham and Republicans , however , want to ask the witnesses about how details of Flynn 's conversations , and other classified information , found their way into The Washington Post and other newspapers ahead of Trump 's inauguration .
That 's why Graham wanted Rice to be there . Republicans say the real issue in the Russia imbroglio is that she might have run a secret political snooping operation , abusing her power to view intelligence so she could spy on Trump and his aides .
Rice has denied any wrongdoing , then or now , and supporters who have viewed the classified material related to the recent surveillance case say there 's no evidence of anything illegal .
Graham and Rice have a long track record . He criticized her fiercely over her role in explaining the cause of the 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi , Libya , and was one of the leaders in the successful effort to block Obama 's effort to make her secretary of state .
Trump has sometimes accepted the intelligence community 's verdict that the Russian meddling took place , sometimes said its causes were unknowable , and sometimes says he believes the whole story is a smoke screen created by Democrats . He accused Obama of wiretapping him during the transition and told The New York Times he thought Rice may have committed a crime .
Trump wrote on Twitter on Monday that he hoped Yates is asked how reporters got the news about her discussions with the White House .
Spicer , asked whether Trump had any evidence to support the implication that Yates was connected to the leak , said in a press conference that the president 's tweet `` speaks for itself . ''
Republicans argue this story is really about the abuse of classified information , and partisan skirmishing along those lines sidelined the House Intelligence Committee 's inquiry into the Russian mischief , although the leaders of that panel tried to make a case last week that they 're back on track .
Yates was originally slated to appear before a House Intelligence Committee hearing that was canceled .
White House officials rejected the notion they tried to throw up a roadblock to her appearance before members of Congress . Spicer said March 28 that the administration had no objections and that he hoped Yates would testify — as she is scheduled to do at 2:30 p.m . ET Monday .
Similar feuding complicated Rice 's involvement in Monday 's Senate subcommittee hearing . Graham wanted her to appear . But the panel 's top Democrat , Sheldon Whitehouse , did not agree to invite her , calling the Rice storyline a `` distraction . ''
Citing this `` significant departure from the bipartisan invitations extended to other witnesses , '' an attorney for Rice wrote the subcommittee last week to say Rice would not testify . The letter was first reported by CNN .
Before that , the question of Yates ' testimony also was a sticking point . Adam Schiff , the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee , told NPR he believed the Trump administration had tried to stop Yates from appearing because it feared the embarrassment she might cause .
Yates reportedly told White House Counsel Don McGahn in January that Flynn had n't told the truth about his discussions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the presidential transition — and that the Russians could use that knowledge to blackmail him .","Sally Yates To Testify In Russia Hearing.

A Senate hearing Monday on Russian meddling in the 2016 election is expected to feature two powerful Washington women, one of whom will be in the room — and one of whom will not.

Former acting U.S. Attorney General Sally Yates and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, both of whom served under President Barack Obama, are set to appear before South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham's crime and terrorism subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee.

But Graham and his fellow Republicans also may focus heavily on former national security adviser Susan Rice, who declined to appear.

Democrats want Yates to describe what she told White House officials shortly after President Trump's inauguration about the FBI's investigation into then-national security adviser Michael Flynn. Yates' Jan. 26 meeting in the executive mansion reportedly was to notify the administration that the FBI believed Flynn could be vulnerable to Russian blackmail. He resigned weeks later.

A former member of the Obama administration says that wasn't Trump's first caution about Flynn. The former official says Obama gave then-President-elect Trump a warning about Flynn, based on his job performance as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Flynn ran that agency for two years during the Obama administration but was fired, reportedly over management issues.

White House press secretary Sean Spicer confirmed that Obama ""made it clear that he was not a fan of Gen. Flynn's"" but suggested that could be interpreted as ""bad blood"" motivated by Flynn's criticisms of Obama, rather than a substantive warning.

""If President Obama was truly concerned, why didn't he suspend Gen. Flynn's security clearance?"" Spicer asked at a press conference Monday.

Since his brief tenure as Trump's national security adviser, Flynn has offered to tell his story to congressional committees in exchange for immunity from prosecution — an offer that so far no one has accepted.

Trump fired Yates, who had continued serving into his administration before he had nominated his own attorney general, in late January over another controversy.

Graham and Republicans, however, want to ask the witnesses about how details of Flynn's conversations, and other classified information, found their way into The Washington Post and other newspapers ahead of Trump's inauguration.

That's why Graham wanted Rice to be there. Republicans say the real issue in the Russia imbroglio is that she might have run a secret political snooping operation, abusing her power to view intelligence so she could spy on Trump and his aides.

Rice has denied any wrongdoing, then or now, and supporters who have viewed the classified material related to the recent surveillance case say there's no evidence of anything illegal.

Graham and Rice have a long track record. He criticized her fiercely over her role in explaining the cause of the 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, and was one of the leaders in the successful effort to block Obama's effort to make her secretary of state.

Trump has sometimes accepted the intelligence community's verdict that the Russian meddling took place, sometimes said its causes were unknowable, and sometimes says he believes the whole story is a smoke screen created by Democrats. He accused Obama of wiretapping him during the transition and told The New York Times he thought Rice may have committed a crime.

Trump wrote on Twitter on Monday that he hoped Yates is asked how reporters got the news about her discussions with the White House.

Spicer, asked whether Trump had any evidence to support the implication that Yates was connected to the leak, said in a press conference that the president's tweet ""speaks for itself.""

Republicans argue this story is really about the abuse of classified information, and partisan skirmishing along those lines sidelined the House Intelligence Committee's inquiry into the Russian mischief, although the leaders of that panel tried to make a case last week that they're back on track.

Yates was originally slated to appear before a House Intelligence Committee hearing that was canceled.

White House officials rejected the notion they tried to throw up a roadblock to her appearance before members of Congress. Spicer said March 28 that the administration had no objections and that he hoped Yates would testify — as she is scheduled to do at 2:30 p.m. ET Monday.

Similar feuding complicated Rice's involvement in Monday's Senate subcommittee hearing. Graham wanted her to appear. But the panel's top Democrat, Sheldon Whitehouse, did not agree to invite her, calling the Rice storyline a ""distraction.""

Citing this ""significant departure from the bipartisan invitations extended to other witnesses,"" an attorney for Rice wrote the subcommittee last week to say Rice would not testify. The letter was first reported by CNN.

Before that, the question of Yates' testimony also was a sticking point. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told NPR he believed the Trump administration had tried to stop Yates from appearing because it feared the embarrassment she might cause.

Yates reportedly told White House Counsel Don McGahn in January that Flynn hadn't told the truth about his discussions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the presidential transition — and that the Russians could use that knowledge to blackmail him.",www.npr.org,center,j1ebuNLkE5QPNPCy

Passage of the biggest U.S. tax rewrite since 1986 would provide Republican lawmakers and President Donald Trump their first major legislative victory since he took office in January. Prospects for approval soared after Republican senators Marco Rubio and Bob Corker pledged support.

Three Republican senators, enough to defeat the measure in a Senate that Trump’s party controls with a slim 52-48 majority, remained uncommitted: Susan Collins, Jeff Flake and Mike Lee.

The final version hammered out between Senate and House of Representatives Republicans after each chamber previously passed competing versions contained no surprises.

For months, Trump has touted the bill as a middle-class tax cut. Studies from independent analysts and non-partisan congressional researchers have projected that corporations and the rich would benefit disproportionately.

TOP RATE CUT

The Republican bill would maintain the existing seven individual and family income tax brackets with rates of 10, 12, 22, 24, 32, 35 and 37 percent. That top rate, for the highest-earning Americans, would be cut from today’s 39.6 percent.

LATE CHANGES

As the tax package evolved, it tilted increasingly toward benefiting businesses and the wealthy. Provisions for offsetting the revenue costs of last-minute changes were troublesome for some lawmakers.

Rubio said he would support the bill after its approach to the child tax credit was changed. The bill doubles the credit, meant to help reduce the costs of raising kids, to $2,000 per dependent child under the age of 17, with a refundable portion of $1,400.

“ I think it ’ s somewhat ironic to see some members of Congress wanting to make common cause with the hard-liners in Iran .

“Many Iran experts say that Iran’s leaders don’t understand our Constitution, so they need to understand that under our Constitution, Congress plays a very important role of improving international agreements, and any deal that is not approved by the Congress won’t be accepted by the Congress — now or in the future,” Mr. Cotton said Monday on “Fox and Friends.”

White House officials argued Monday that major diplomatic agreements typically aren’t cast aside as soon as a new president comes to power, though they did not deny that the deal could be abandoned as soon as January 2017.

On Capitol Hill — where there’s been bipartisan support for slapping new economic sanctions on Iran even as nuclear negotiations continue — top Democrats condemned the letter.

“This letter is a hard slap not only in the face of the United States but in the face of our allies,” Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said on the Senate floor. “Let’s be very clear: Republicans are undermining our commander in chief while empowering the Ayatollahs.”

Mr. Reid also said that while he had disagreed with President George W. Bush on the Iraq War, he never stooped to writing a letter to undermine the commander in chief’s policy.

However, Mr. Reid was accused of potentially traitorous remarks and undermining troop morale when, in a 2007 speech, he declared “this war is lost.” The Bush White House called those comments “disturbing.”

WASHINGTON – A short-term spending bill that would fund the government through early next year and avert a looming government shutdown cleared its first hurdle Wednesday night when it won approval in the Senate.

Senators voted by voice vote to approve the spending measure, which would temporarily end a budget impasse by funding nine federal departments and several smaller agencies at their current funding levels through Feb. 8.

The bill now goes to the House, which could approve it on Thursday.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., offered the temporary spending bill after President Donald Trump’s demand for $5 billion in funding for a wall along the nation’s southern border resulted in a standoff that threatened to shut down parts of the government. The temporary spending bill punts a decision on border wall funding until next year.

“We don’t want to end this year the way we began it, with another government shutdown,” McConnell said.

Nine federal departments and several smaller agencies – a quarter of the government – will run out of money and shut down at midnight Friday unless Congress and the White House agree to extend their funding.

Whether Trump will sign the short-term funding bill remains uncertain. Trump boasted during an Oval Office meeting with Democratic leaders last week that he would be “proud” to shut down the government over border security and that he’d be willing to take the blame for any fallout.

But the White House retreated from that threat this week. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Tuesday that Trump asked his Cabinet secretaries to look for other sources of funding to help protect the border and suggested that the administration is looking to Congress for ways to avoid a shutdown.

“We've laid out clearly what our parameters are with members of Congress,” Sanders said. “We want to know what they can pass. We want to know what they think they can actually get done. We've laid out what we'd like to see. In the meantime, we're looking at other areas where we can draw money from to make sure that the president can actually protect our border and protect American citizens.”

Earlier Wednesday, before McConnell had announced plans for the temporary funding bill, one of Trump’s top advisers, presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway, said he might sign a short-term measure. But she insisted he was not giving up on his campaign promise to build a border wall.

“There are other ways for him to get that money and he said, one way or another, he will get the money for the border security,” Conway said.

On Capitol Hill, McConnell expressed confidence that a shutdown would be avoided even though Democrats rejected an earlier GOP proposal to end the impasse.

In an 11th-hour attempt at compromise, McConnell proposed approving a spending bill that would include $1.6 billion for border fencing along with an additional $1 billion for immigration. Democrats described the additional funding as a ""slush fund"" and rejected the offer.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the GOP proposal would have allowed Trump to continue “his very wrong immigration policies.”

“That won’t happen,” she said.

McConnell followed up with the offer of a short-term spending bill, and Pelosi said House Democrats would support it.

On the Senate floor, McConnell accused Democrats of rejecting the earlier compromise out of ""knee-jerk, partisan opposition"" to Trump.

“It seems like political spite for the president may be winning out over sensible policy,"" he said.

Nine federal departments wait for Congress to approve their budgets. Those departments are Agriculture, Commerce, Justice, Homeland Security, Interior, State, Transportation, Treasury and Housing and Urban Development, as well as several smaller agencies.

Both of the government shutdowns during Trump’s presidency were ended by short-term funding bills.

In January, parts of the government shut down for three days after an impasse in the Senate over federal funding. The shutdown ended when the Senate passed a short-term spending measure.

Less than three weeks later, the government shut down for a second time after Congress failed to pass a spending bill to keep the agencies running. That shutdown ended after only six hours when lawmakers passed a six-week spending bill.

USA Today

America has been without a secretary of State for three weeks, and without one who had the trust of the White House for months before that. President Trump's unceremonious dismissal of Rex Tillerson left a void at State at a moment when talks with North Korea, rising tensions with Russia and a crisis in Syria hang in the balance.

To fill the vacancy for America's top diplomat, Trump has nominated CIA Director Mike Pompeo, who faces a Senate committee vote Monday. Although Pompeo's hawkish views are reason for concern, they are not sufficient reason to block his confirmation.

Unless a nominee has clear ethical or competency failings, presidents should be accorded wide latitude to select top aides whom they trust and agree with. Pompeo passes that test and merits approval.

HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH:Pompeo's way is not the American way

Democrats and one Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who are threatening to block Pompeo's nomination might win a Pyrrhic, short-term victory. Pompeo — who served ably as CIA director, including on his recent secret mission to North Korea — would be branded the only secretary of State ever rejected by the committee. Regardless of what the committee does, however, his fate will almost certainly reach the Senate floor for approval.

To be sure, we've had differences with the former Kansas congressman and Tea Party darling. Pompeo denounced the Iran nuclear deal and called for U.S.-backed regime change in Tehran. He agreed with Trump's ill-considered decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord. And, in an apparent sop to his boss last year, Pompeo asserted that Russian interference in the 2016 election had no bearing on the outcome, something he had no way of knowing.

But more recently on Iran, Pompeo pledged at his confirmation hearings to support a diplomatic resolution of the nuclear deal if the United States pulls out. In addition, despite his outspoken discomfort with same-sex marriage, Pompeo vowed to push for worldwide recognition of LGBTQ rights if he becomes secretary of State.

Notwithstanding his comments regarding the impact of Russian attempts to undermine U.S. elections, Pompeo has a strong record for being tough on Moscow's recent history of malign behavior, a welcome point of view for a president too often conciliatory of Vladimir Putin's leadership.

Pompeo is no dummy — he graduated from Harvard Law School and at the top of his class at West Point. He served as a cavalry officer in Europe during the Cold War. Crucially, he has promised to reverse the damage done by Tillerson, who implemented a vacuous reorganization that drained talent and grew vacancies at State.

""I'm a talent hawk,"" Pompeo testified. ""I will find what I believe to be the best fit to execute America's diplomatic mission around the world and I will encourage, demand, cajole them to come join the team."" Among the first positions to fill, he said, would be ambassador to South Korea.

For a president who promised only ""the best"" people for his Cabinet, Trump's turnover rate so early in his presidency is the highest in a century, according to an NPR analysis. Three Cabinet officers have been fired, and a fourth was shifted to chief of staff.

Pompeo is far from the worst of Trump's picks and, if he is confirmed and lives up to his confirmation hearing pledges, he has the potential to be one of the better ones.

And those are just fellow Republicans talking.

Within the chummy confines of the U.S. Senate, Vitter has emerged as one of the most disliked members. The second-term senator’s effort to kill the federal health care contribution, worth several thousand dollars to lawmakers and their staffers, is a big part of it. But the two-year drive, his critics say, symbolizes an operating style that Vitter’s critics complain is consumed with public relations, even for an ambitious member of Congress: speeding in and out of meetings, railing about issues on the Senate floor but doing little to execute behind the scenes, firing off news releases left and right. In an institution in which the inside game is critical, Vitter doesn’t even pretend to bother with it.

The most recent repudiation of Vitter, who’s running for Louisiana governor this year, came a month ago in the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, which he chairs. He tried to subpoena documents to investigate how members of Congress and their aides became eligible for health care under Obamacare’s D.C. exchange.

Five Republicans — including presidential candidate Rand Paul — blocked the request, angering Vitter and prompting an unusual round of second-guessing from GOP committee members over their chairman’s agenda.

“I thought there were more appropriate uses of the Small Business Committee,” said Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), who voted against the subpoena request.

Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) went so far as to suggest that Vitter’s work at the helm of the panel compares unfavorably with how Democrats ran it the prior two years. The focus then was on innovation and job growth, she said, “so I hope Chairman Vitter is going to go back to that.”

A number of off-committee Republicans gripe that Vitter’s accusation that lawmakers are getting a sweetheart deal is unfair and misleading. If he succeeds, some of them say, more of their high-level aides will bolt Capitol Hill for lucrative jobs in the private sector.

Several GOP senators said privately that Vitter’s effort appears to be rooted in his campaign for governor.

“We all know why David’s doing this,” said a senior Republican senator who asked not to be named to speak frankly.

Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), meanwhile, said Vitter’s arguments on the health care issue are “disingenuous.”

“I think to some degree, it’s disingenuous to suggest to taxpayers that this is about saving money when the result is going to be to raise people’s salary to compensate them for what they’re not getting for coverage for health care,” Burr said.

Vitter insists lawmakers and Hill aides are illegally exploiting a loophole in the law.

“Washington’s Obamacare exemption is a clear example of Washington elitism and fear of transparency, which is why I will continue investigating how Congress was designated as a small business in the first place to receive a special taxpayer-funded subsidy,” the senator, who declined to be interviewed, said in a statement. “The Obamacare exemption for Congress is a slap in the face to the Americans suffering through the pains of Obamacare.”

Vitter, 54, a Rhodes scholar who earned his undergraduate degree from Harvard, is one of the more conservative members of the Senate GOP Conference. But his personal style — an unusual combination of brashness and standoffishness that dates to his time in the Louisiana statehouse two decades ago — has long annoyed many of his cohorts.

“He doesn’t really like to talk to members,” one GOP senator who asked not to be named said of Vitter, who also does not engage with reporters in the halls of the Capitol.

On the floor, Vitter periodically flashes a temper. “That’s a bunch of bull,” he fumed last week during a procedural squabble over the Iran nuclear bill.

But even as he’s known as a fierce partisan, Vitter has periodically struck bipartisan deals. Recently he worked with Sens. Tom Udall of New Mexico, Jeff Merkley of Oregon and other liberals on reforming a law governing toxic substances, and he worked with a bipartisan group of senators last year to overhaul the flood insurance program.

Vitter has recovered from his involvement in the 2007 “D.C. Madam” scandal, when his phone number turned up in the records of a prostitution ring. It prompted the socially conservative Vitter, who is Roman Catholic, to apologize for a “very serious sin.” He won reelection in 2010 by nearly 20 points and now has a serious chance of winning the governor’s race this year. His unpopularity in the Senate hasn’t translated to his poll numbers: One survey in December showed four in five Republicans viewed him favorably.

Targeting the health care contributions to Capitol Hill employees has been Vitter’s signature issue in the Senate in recent years. Before 2014, lawmakers and staff received federally subsidized health insurance, but an Obamacare provision proposed by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) to force Hill employees onto the exchanges changed that. The White House responded by issuing a rule that allowed members and aides to keep their subsidy by enrolling in a D.C. small-business health care exchange — a move Vitter and critics blasted as an end run around the law.

Killing the subsidy could cost many lawmakers and staffers $5,000 or more annually. Federal coverage typically pays about 70 percent of premiums for employees, including lawmakers and staff, which is in line with what many large employers cover.

“Virtually all large employers subsidize the health insurance of their employees,” said Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), “and I don’t see a basis for taking away the standard employer contribution to health insurance benefits for members of Congress or their staffs. It’s that simple.”

Vitter has some allies in his health care effort, including Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and the conservative group Judicial Watch. Both have sued to block the federal contributions to lawmakers and staff, but both cases have failed to pass muster with the courts so far.

Vitter’s repeated attempts over the past two years to force a vote on the subsidies, which predated his announcement for governor in early 2014, were blocked by Democrats. The stalemate ended up tying up an unrelated bipartisan energy efficiency bill for much of the previous Congress.

“I thought he had a right to offer it,” said Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), one of the authors of the energy bill. “On the other hand, I wish he had not chosen to pick on us; in other words, not chosen to do it there.”

After the GOP’s November election victories, Vitter succeeded in winning adoption of an internal Senate GOP policy change calling on staff to join the Obamacare exchanges, though it didn’t target the employer contribution and is not binding on Republican offices. In March, 52 Senate Republicans voted to add to the nonbinding budget resolution a Vitter plan ending the “illegal Obamacare exemption,” with just Collins and Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.) joining Democrats in voting against it.

Neither carries the force of law.

While Vitter “has a point,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), “I’m not trying to make it harder to recruit people to work on Capitol Hill.

“At the end of the day, you change the health care benefit package, our employees aren’t getting anything that any government workers don’t get,” Graham added.

Paul, the Kentucky Republican, said of Vitter’s effort to investigate the matter in committee: “I just think there’s a different way of doing this.”

Most senators, of course, are wealthy enough to get by without the federal contribution. But some lawmakers could feel the pinch, particularly since they often maintain two homes — one in Washington and one back home.

Sen. Jeff Flake’s minimum net worth is just $51,000, according to his financial disclosure forms. The Arizona Republican said it wouldn’t be right for lawmakers and aides to lose their contributions if other federal employees get to keep theirs.

“I just think we ought to be treated like everybody else,” Flake said.

“I think most people feel that the current interpretation is merely a function of treating members of Congress and staff as federal employees,” said Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), who has hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt. “No more, no less.”

Wicker, along with several other Republicans, said Vitter and the GOP should instead be focused on the “larger” fight against the Affordable Care Act. The big looming issue is a Supreme Court ruling in King v. Burwell, a case that could cause 7.5 million Americans to lose their health care subsidies within months.

“I understand [Vitter’s] focus on it, but I think what we need to be preparing for is if the Supreme Court decides the right way, then the whole [health care law] is going to have to be revisited,” said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). “I just don’t think he’s made a lot of progress on this issue.”

At this point , a Senate conviction is incredibly unlikely : 67 senators would need to vote in favor of it , a move that would require 20 Republicans to join with the 47-member Democratic caucus and break with the president .
Senate Republicans , however , still intend to hold a trial and do not plan to dismiss the articles outright , partly because they don ’ t have the votes to do so .

How Senate Republicans plan to mount a defense of Trump

Biden Jr. , used his father ’ s connections to make money in Ukraine .
Just last week , Sen. Lindsey Graham signaled lawmakers ’ commitment to this strategy by requesting documents from the State Department tied to former Vice President Joe Biden ’ s efforts to fire Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin . Republicans have argued that Biden ’ s decision to do so was aimed at shielding his son Hunter Biden , a board member of Burisma , a Ukrainian energy company , though there ’ s no evidence that suggests this was the case .
“ If there ’ s nothing there I ’ ll be the first one to say there ’ s nothing there . But we ’ re not going to live in a country where only one party gets investigated , ” Graham told Politico of his decision to more forward with this push .
Sens . Ron Johnson and Chuck Grassley , too , are requesting more information about a former Democratic National Committee consultant ’ s interactions with Ukrainian officials during the 2016 election , a move aimed at legitimizing the disproved conspiracy theory that Democrats colluded with Ukraine in an effort to fix the 2016 election in favor of Hillary Clinton .
In doing so , the senators hope to suggest Trump was focused on investigations in Ukraine in order to protect the sanctity of US elections ( and to obscure the fact that the impeachment proceedings largely hinge on allegations Trump tried to pressure Ukraine into meddling in an election ) . Various lawmakers , including Trump , have also said that the whistleblower who filed the original complaint about Trump ’ s interactions with Ukraine should be among the witnesses called during the impeachment trial .
Each of these efforts is aimed at shifting the attention from Trump ’ s request for investigations of Hunter Biden to put the pressure on Democrats .

Kentucky Democrats Think So,,Shushannah Walshe,"The beautiful movie star tries to take on Washington by defeating a powerful Republican leader . It 's not a plot line , it 's reality : The actress Ashley Judd is making moves to take on GOP Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell .
She has n't announced yet , but her biggest supporter in Kentucky , Democratic Rep. John Yarmuth , told ███ , `` I would be surprised if she does n't run at this point . ''
`` My impression is this is something she wants to do , and she is now taking the time to make the contacts she needs to make throughout the state to try and generate commitments of support and in some cases fundraising , '' Yarmuth said . `` She is certainly acting like a candidate , a potential candidate .
`` I think in her own mind ... she has made a decision to run and she 's doing the right thing and not ruffling any feathers along the way , '' Yarmuth said .
Yarmuth , the only Kentucky Democrat in Congress , said he expects the decision to come soon .
The race will be one of the most watched in the country , with outside money pouring into the state . Yarmuth said : `` It would be a great economic stimulus . It would be Christmas for six months or more , '' especially for local television stations that would run political commercials .
`` I think the contrast would be so marked and I think it will be someone with a vision for the future and someone so stuck in a rut in the past that he no longer represents the future of the commonwealth , '' Yarmuth said .
One thing that 's guaranteed is it will be a brutal race -- a 30-year veteran of Washington against a Hollywood star active in liberal Democratic politics from a legendary family . Judd 's mother is the country singer Naomi Judd and her half-sister is the singer Wynonna Judd .
Yarmuth says Judd is ready and has even done opposition research on herself to see areas McConnell will try to `` exploit . ''
`` I think she has no illusions about what Mitch McConnell will do and the fact that his entire career he has demonized opponents and never talks about himself , '' Yarmuth said . `` In her world she is used to dealing with a lot of nonsense so I think she will deal with it very well . ''
And it 's already started . McConnell released a humorous Web video called `` Obama 's Kentucky Candidate , '' which shows the president trying to find a candidate to take on McConnell .
It goes after Judd and other Kentucky Democrats who may get into the race . It focuses on an issue that is clear to become one in the race : that Judd lives in Tennessee and not in Kentucky . In the video Judd calls both Tennessee and San Francisco `` home . ''
This was n't the first anti-Judd video . Earlier this month the Karl Rove-backed superPAC American Crossroads released an ad hitting Judd as well . Her family does go back eight generations in the state , though , and she is from Ashland in eastern Kentucky ( though , of course , her own grandmother famously dubbed her a Hollywood liberal ) .
Yarmuth said the residency issue would not be a `` particularly effective '' one because `` her roots are so firmly established growing up here . ''

On Valentine 's Day Judd had dinner with Yarmuth and other Democratic leaders in the state , including Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer and former state treasurer Jonathan Miller , at the home of Louisville philanthropist Christy Brown .
Judd is also planning to meet with Democratic Gov . Steve Beshear . According to a video posted on local television channel CN2 he said she could be a `` very serious candidate , '' although he noted there are others who could be as well .

Not all Democrats are jumping on the Judd bandwagon , though . Some are loudly voicing their opposition because they believe she is too liberal for most Kentuckians and will drag down other Democrats .
Longtime Democratic consultant Jim Cauley said Kentucky Democrats are worried .
`` She 's got to ask , how does she connect with an average Kentuckian with issues like immense poverty and lack of education , '' Cauley said . `` Her life experience does n't seem to connect with that . ''
Cauley said the political consultants that Judd has circling her can only `` see dollar signs . ''
`` I hope she is listening to someone who does n't just have dollar signs in front of her face , '' Cauley said before a note of caution . `` Her life is going to get ready to be picked apart , divorce and all . I 've watched ( McConnell ) dismantle people . '' ( Judd announced her divorce from her husband of 11 years just last month . McConnell is also divorced ) .
Cauley says state Democrats are worried they will lose the state House of Representatives . Obama lost the state in 2012 , though Democrats actually have an advantage in voter registration . Democrats are a minority in the state Senate and are uneasy about the governor 's race in 2015 .
`` That would turn Kentucky from purple to completely red and that breaks my heart , but if they want to run at it , run at it , '' Cauley said .
Cauley was President Obama 's campaign manager for his 2004 senate race in Illinois . Some Kentucky Democrats have asked him to call the president to try and get him to ask Judd not to run .
Yarmuth says he knows of the concern , but does n't think Democrats should worry .
`` I argue that the energy and excitement she will create with her campaign will boost turnout for the people who will vote for not just her , but Democrats down the ballot , '' Yarmuth said .
Former Kentucky Secretary of State and senate candidate Trey Grayson says the race will be an `` uphill battle for any Democrat running , '' but Judd has two advantages : she will get a `` ton of earned money and have no problem raising money . ''
Grayson , who now is the director of Harvard 's Institute of Politics , says `` the best way to knock off Mitch McConnell '' may be someone on the outside , but he notes the residency issue could be her biggest problem , as well as her vocal support of Obama .
`` They wo n't question her Kentucky bona fides , but she literally does n't live there , '' Grayson said . `` It 's a bit of an issue . ''
McConnell campaign manager Jesse Benton said at this point Republicans are `` not thinking too much about any specific opponent , '' and until someone files they will be `` building the best campaign organization that we possibly can . ''
`` We did test a few issues against Ashley Judd back in December and we did see that some of the positions she has taken are quite outside what Kentuckians want to see in a senator and really moved the ballot against her . ''
Benton said they are going to run a `` positive '' and `` professional '' campaign , but believe state and national Democrats will `` bring the kitchen sink , a full onslaught '' against McConnell .
`` We are prepared to run strong , '' he said . `` And we are going to make sure we defend Sen . McConnell . ''","The beautiful movie star tries to take on Washington by defeating a powerful Republican leader. It's not a plot line, it's reality: The actress Ashley Judd is making moves to take on GOP Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.

She hasn't announced yet, but her biggest supporter in Kentucky, Democratic Rep. John Yarmuth, told ABC News, ""I would be surprised if she doesn't run at this point.""

""My impression is this is something she wants to do, and she is now taking the time to make the contacts she needs to make throughout the state to try and generate commitments of support and in some cases fundraising,"" Yarmuth said. ""She is certainly acting like a candidate, a potential candidate.

""I think in her own mind ... she has made a decision to run and she's doing the right thing and not ruffling any feathers along the way,"" Yarmuth said.

Yarmuth, the only Kentucky Democrat in Congress, said he expects the decision to come soon.

The race will be one of the most watched in the country, with outside money pouring into the state. Yarmuth said: ""It would be a great economic stimulus. It would be Christmas for six months or more,"" especially for local television stations that would run political commercials.

""I think the contrast would be so marked and I think it will be someone with a vision for the future and someone so stuck in a rut in the past that he no longer represents the future of the commonwealth,"" Yarmuth said.

One thing that's guaranteed is it will be a brutal race -- a 30-year veteran of Washington against a Hollywood star active in liberal Democratic politics from a legendary family. Judd's mother is the country singer Naomi Judd and her half-sister is the singer Wynonna Judd.

Yarmuth says Judd is ready and has even done opposition research on herself to see areas McConnell will try to ""exploit.""

""I think she has no illusions about what Mitch McConnell will do and the fact that his entire career he has demonized opponents and never talks about himself,"" Yarmuth said. ""In her world she is used to dealing with a lot of nonsense so I think she will deal with it very well.""

And it's already started. McConnell released a humorous Web video called ""Obama's Kentucky Candidate,"" which shows the president trying to find a candidate to take on McConnell.

It goes after Judd and other Kentucky Democrats who may get into the race. It focuses on an issue that is clear to become one in the race: that Judd lives in Tennessee and not in Kentucky. In the video Judd calls both Tennessee and San Francisco ""home.""

This wasn't the first anti-Judd video. Earlier this month the Karl Rove-backed superPAC American Crossroads released an ad hitting Judd as well. Her family does go back eight generations in the state, though, and she is from Ashland in eastern Kentucky (though, of course, her own grandmother famously dubbed her a Hollywood liberal).

Yarmuth said the residency issue would not be a ""particularly effective"" one because ""her roots are so firmly established growing up here.""

""Everyone knows that Kentucky is her first love,"" Yarmuth said. He called the carpetbagger attacks a ""waste of time"" and he hopes McConnell ""keeps making them.""

On Valentine's Day Judd had dinner with Yarmuth and other Democratic leaders in the state, including Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer and former state treasurer Jonathan Miller, at the home of Louisville philanthropist Christy Brown.

Beshear knows McConnell can be tough. He challenged him and lost in 1996.

Miller called Judd a ""change agent.""

That deal was a delicate compromise between gun control advocates and the National Rifle Association , but as the Sutherland Springs shooting showed , it fell short of its promise .
The new measure , called the Fix NICS Act — NICS is the acronym for the National Instant Criminal Background Check System — is modest when compared to the demands of gun safety advocates , who have for years been pushing to expand background checks for gun buyers and to limit the purchase of assault weapons .
Instead , the new measure would require federal agencies and states to produce plans showing how they intend to comply with existing laws governing reporting to the background check system . It would reward states that comply with financial incentives by making it easier for them to get federal grants . And it would penalize federal agencies that fail to report to the system by barring bonus pay for political appointees .
John Feinblatt , the president of Everytown for Gun Safety , an advocacy group here , praised the measure as “ an important first step ” to improve the background check system .
The massacre in Texas showed once again that the computerized background check program is only as good as the data that is put into it . The 2007 massacre at Virginia Tech brought attention to the system ’ s flaws after it was revealed that the gunman , Seung-Hui Cho , had been ordered by a court into mental health treatment , but that court order had not been forwarded to the background check database , a failure that may have allowed him to purchase his arsenal .
Although the gun debate is contentious in Congress , surveys show the majority of Americans — even those in households with guns — want to see gun safety laws passed . A poll released Thursday by Quinnipiac University found that 60 percent of voters favor stricter gun laws , and 59 percent say it is too easy to buy a gun in the United States . The survey also found that 94 percent of those living in households with guns favor universal background checks for gun buyers .","The measure is reminiscent of another law, passed in 2007 after a massacre at Virginia Tech, which provided incentives and grant money for states to update the background-check database with more criminal records and mental health information.

us_senate,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/2019/3/5/18241447/filibuster-reform-explained-warren-booker-sanders,"The Democratic debate over filibuster reform, explained",2019-03-05,Matthew Yglesias,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( D-MA ) thinks Democrats should end the filibuster if they regain the majority in the US Senate , and pass legislation by majority rule .
“ When Democrats next have power , we should be bold and clear : We ’ re done with two sets of rules — one for the Republicans and one for the Democrats , ” Warren says in advance text of a Friday speech to the National Action Network obtained by CNN . “ And that means when Democrats have the White House again , if Mitch McConnell tries to do what he did to President Obama and puts small-minded partisanship ahead of solving the massive problems facing this country , then we should get rid of the filibuster . ”
Warren is , of course , running for president and doubtless envisions herself as leading this charge from the White House . The Senate , however , makes its own rules , and a majority of senators could vote to change the rules and allow majority votes to prevail . If Democrats fare well in 2020 , a rule change would greatly increase the likelihood that some of these big progressive ideas could come to fruition . But top Democrats are skeptical .
“ We should not be doing anything to mess with the strength of the filibuster , ” says Sen. Cory Booker ( D-NJ ) .
Most presidential candidates in the Senate are with Booker . Bernie Sanders ( I-VT ) says he ’ s “ not crazy about getting rid of the filibuster. ” His plan for Senate reform is statehood for the District of Columbia , which he thinks can be done because “ I hope my Republican colleagues do the right thing . ”
Sen. Kamala Harris ( D-CA ) is “ conflicted. ” And Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand ( D-NY ) is concerned about the risks to being in the minority . “ Having just lived through being in the minority , ” she explains , “ I just want to think long and hard about it . ”
Candidates not in the Senate , by contrast , are more inclined to agree with Warren . South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg is all for scrapping it , as is Washington Gov . Jay Inslee .
This debate is important because there ’ s no way almost anything the candidates are promising to do will happen unless the filibuster is lifted .
It ’ s up to the Senate to change its rules , not the president — Barack Obama ’ s calls for filibuster reform didn ’ t work , and neither have Donald Trump ’ s — and most of the candidates running are going to be back in the Senate after 2020 . They show little appetite for reform .
Progressive politics right now is very focused on broad ideological visions . It hasn ’ t grappled with the reality that progressives are at a massive disadvantage in the upper chamber of Congress and no bold idea will make it through without a change .
Fans of the filibuster often describe it as a noble and longstanding Senate tradition , evoking the image of Jimmy Stewart speaking for 25 hours straight to fight corruption in the movies . But the practice actually has a mostly sordid history . And its current usage serves as a de facto requirement that all bills clear a supermajority threshold .
In its earliest days , the US Senate lacked any procedural mechanism for forcing the end of debate on an issue . This was understood as a matter of collegiality in what was at the time a very small legislative body , and not as a requirement that legislation be unanimous . There were a handful of filibusters over the course of the 19th century ( North Carolina Sen. William King organized an important 1841 filibuster of legislation to reauthorize the charter of the Second Bank of the United States ) , but in general , legislation passed by majority rule .
Things changed in 1917 . Near the height of World War I , Germany announced a policy that its submarines would enforce a blockade of Britain-bound shipping by sinking any merchant vessels heading for the British Isles . In response , Woodrow Wilson and most members of Congress supported legislation that would arm American merchant ships . Sen. George Norris of Nebraska along with 11 colleagues filibustered the bill , and in response , Wilson urged the Senate to adopt a rule allowing for a supermajority of 67 senators to kill a filibuster .
This allowed Wilson ’ s wartime legislation to pass , but somewhat ironically , limiting filibusters served to somewhat normalize them , and it became routine for a Southern-based minority of senators to filibuster civil rights legislation .
Over the civil rights battles of the 1950s and ’ 60s , filibustering rules were tweaked several times until the modern filibuster rule emerged in the 1970s . The key features of the modern system are that it requires 60 affirmative votes to end debate on a topic but also that the Senate can simply move on to other issues without having formally invoked cloture on earlier issues . This turned filibustering into a less spectacular event than it had previously been — to filibuster a bill no longer meant holding up all bills — which in practice has served over time to encourage senators to do it more and more frequently .
As recently as the George W. Bush administration , however , it was still the case that not everything was filibustered . Both his 2003 Medicare reform bill and the nomination of Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court passed with more than 50 but fewer than 60 votes , though Democrats did also take the previously unprecedented step of filibustering federal appeals court nominees .
During the political standoff over these appeals court filibusters , some of us argued that Democrats should take advantage of Republican frustration to strike a high-minded compromise and return the Senate to the principle of majority rule .
But Democrats did not take that advice , only to find a few years later when Barack Obama was in office that Republicans were now holding everything to a 60-vote threshold . Constant filibustering shrank the size of the stimulus ( consigning millions of people to years of additional unemployment ) , compromised the design of the Affordable Care Act and the Dodd-Frank Act , and doomed any effort to legislate on climate change or immigration reform .
Later , Republican filibustering of Obama ’ s nominees got so out of control that Senate Democrats felt compelled to change the rules and make filibustering of nominees impossible .
Under Trump , Republicans have taken advantage of that new rule set to get judges confirmed at a rapid pace . But Democratic filibusters have impeded Republican legislating , ensuring that even before Democrats took House in the 2018 midterms , the GOP could not pass legislation to build a wall or cut legal immigration .
Which party the filibuster advantages or disadvantages depends on the current state of politics — in 2005-2006 , filibustering frustrated Republicans ; in 2009-2010 , it frustrated Democrats ; in 2017-2018 , Donald Trump issued the clearest call for filibuster abolition that we ’ ve seen from any president .
A separate question is whether a shift to majority rule would advantage one side over the other systematically over the long haul .
There is , of course , no real way to prove this . But historically , anti-filibuster sentiment has mostly come from the left . Even though policy obviously swings back and forth over time , there does tend to be a ratchet effect . The fight for women ’ s suffrage was long and difficult , but once women had the vote , taking it away was essentially impossible . A broadly similar dynamic tends to play out with social welfare programs as well .
UC Berkeley political scientist Paul Pierson explained in his 1994 book Dismantling the Welfare State ? and his follow-up 1996 paper “ The New Politics of the Welfare State ” ( and a 2017 interview with ███ ) that even very successful conservative politicians like Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher generally fail to take away major social benefits once they ’ ve been created . Pierson argues that social programs create a new politics , and in particular build a constituency of people benefiting from the programs that is politically powerful and can resist efforts to dismantle them .
This is obviously not an ironclad law of nature . But the fact that Bush failed to privatize Social Security and Trump failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act tends to further support Pierson ’ s original analysis of Thatcher and Reagan . Note in particular that Bush ’ s Social Security plans never managed to pass the House , while Trump ACA repeal bills were eligible for a procedural maneuver that would have needed only a simple majority ; in neither case did the filibuster save the welfare state ’ s bacon .
It ’ s very hard to create big new programs , but once they ’ re in place , they are hard to take away . There is , for example , vociferous disagreement about the political viability of a Big Bang switch away from the current US health insurance patchwork to a uniform single-payer system . But nobody thinks that if a single-payer system existed , it would be remotely viable to try to switch back to the current pastiche . Similarly , if you passed a law making it easier to form labor unions , that would lead to more unionized workers , which would make it harder to pass new anti-union laws .
Of course , even if you accept this logic , it ’ s still the case that some important specific progressive causes — the legality of late-term abortions or the continued existence of the diversity visa lottery — could be imperiled by ending filibusters .
More fundamentally , however , the filibuster ’ s existence is convenient for actual senators .
In his classic book Congress : The Electoral Connection , Yale political scientist David Mayhew makes the point that members of Congress are generally rewarded for “ position-taking ” rather than for achieving results .
And while the filibuster makes it harder to achieve results , precisely for that reason , it makes position-taking easier . A Democratic senator facing pressure from activists to raise the federal minimum wage to $ 15 an hour might worry that his read of the economics literature is much more supportive of something like a $ 12 wage floor . But coming out for $ 12 would disappoint activists without meaningfully appeasing employer groups who oppose any increase whatsoever . The good news for our conflicted senator is that since it would take 60 votes for a bill to pass , there ’ s very little need to worry that even unanimous Democratic support for $ 15 an hour is going to produce a $ 15-an-hour minimum wage anytime soon .
If you decide that you want to side with the activists , in other words , you can just side with the activists and not worry too much about the details . A senator can even take a position in favor of some sweeping piece of legislation and then quietly reassure interest group opponents that everyone knows this isn ’ t getting 60 votes and really just represents an opening bid .
Senators in purple states , meanwhile , often enjoy the ability to avoid taking clear positions on issues . Since many areas of policy can , in practice , only be legislated on via bipartisan deals , it ’ s usually possible for a member to remain ambiguous whenever that seems most suitable .
Reform happens on the rare occasions when the imperative to actually make policy outweighs senators ’ preference for position-taking . Wartime exigency in 1917 was such an example . The GOP using filibusters of nominations to render whole federal agencies inoperable was another . Democrats saying they wouldn ’ t confirm Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court simply because they didn ’ t like his jurisprudence was yet another .
Had Senate Republicans blocked any fiscal stimulus move in 2009 , that might have prompted filibuster reform . But instead , Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe agreed to back a somewhat scaled-down package . Later , GOP filibusters of immigration and climate legislation were frustrating to progressives .
But fundamentally , the fact that bills on this topic would have to be bipartisan to pass was exactly what most Democratic members found appealing about the filibuster rule .
Rightly or wrongly , Democrats headed into the Obama years with the expectation that they ’ d be able to do to a lot of substantive legislation on a bipartisan basis .
The Affordable Care Act drew inspiration from several ideas that had attracted Republican support in the past , and during the Bush years , both carbon emissions reduction bills and comprehensive immigration reform bills had received support from a non-trivial minority of GOP legislators . Similarly , for years his administration aspired to achieve some kind of bipartisan “ grand bargain ” on the long-term budget deficit that would pair tax increases on the wealthy with cuts to Social Security and Medicare spending .
This was all proven mostly false by the end of Obama ’ s first term . Still , Obama harbored hope that securing reelection would “ break the fever ” and unlock the doors to bipartisan cooperation . For a brief moment in 2013 , it even seemed like that might be true , until conservative opposition torpedoed a once-promising bipartisan immigration reform bill .
Today ’ s Democrats no longer frame proposals around bipartisan legislative strategies that nobody believes will work . But Warren ’ s words aside , there ’ s also no indication that Democratic senators — including many of the authors of the main ambitious proposals that have dominated the policy debate — are taking any steps to move the Senate to a majority rules basis . Nor do they seem content to limit aspirations to the kind of changes that could qualify for the budget reconciliation loophole . There is , however , no realistic chance that Democrats are going to pick up 13 Senate seats in 2020 .
A perennial cliché of 2018 midterms coverage was that Democrats faced a bad “ map ” in the Senate , with many of their incumbents up for reelection , often in tough states .
And , indeed , the map was so bad that even in the context of the party winning a huge landslide in the House popular vote , they actually lost Senate seats . The 2020 map will be , relative to 2018 , considerably kinder .
There is one highly vulnerable Democratic incumbent ( Doug Jones in Alabama ) and one highly vulnerable Republican ( Cory Gardner in Colorado ) , plus a handful of plausible Democratic pickups in Arizona , Georgia , Iowa , North Carolina , Maine , and maybe Texas , with really nothing plausibly on the board for the GOP .
A more pessimistic way of looking at it , however , would be this . In 2016 , Hillary Clinton won the national popular vote by a healthy 2 percentage points . Nevertheless , she only carried 20 states out of 50 . Three of those states — Pennsylvania , Michigan , and Wisconsin — were very close , so a slight improvement on her 2-point win would get Democrats to 23 . Then there ’ s Florida , which she lost by 1.2 points , and North Carolina , which she lost by 3.7 points .
Assuming a uniform swing , in other words , a Democratic presidential candidate would need to win the national popular vote by almost 6 percentage points in order to carry half the states . That ’ s not impossible to pull off — Obama did it in 2008 , Bill Clinton did in 1996 , and George H.W . Bush did in 1988 — but it ’ s certainly rare . And this means Democrats are going to perennially struggle to obtain a Senate majority . It ’ s not out of the question that Democrats will hold 50 seats after 2020 , but to get them , they ’ ll need to win multiple races in states that Clinton lost by 4 to 5 points and knock off a popular moderate incumbent in Maine — winning a majority of votes nationwide won ’ t be good enough .
The problem , to a first approximation , is that America ’ s largest states — California , Texas , New York , and Florida — all have significantly more non-Hispanic whites than the national average . That ends up meaning that most states are whiter than the national average , meaning white voters — and , as it turns out , specifically rural and less-educated white voters — are significantly overrepresented in the Senate map .
This Senate disadvantage arguably strengthens the progressive case for keeping the filibuster , since if you expect the GOP to hold the majority most of the time , then majority rule voting could only empower Republicans . But there are two offsetting considerations .
One is that the underrepresentation of voters of color in the Senate could be partially rectified by turning DC and Puerto Rico into states , but to do that , you ’ d need to overcome GOP filibusters . The other is that arguably filibustering itself — by making it hard to pass legislation — encourages politics to focus on the hazy culture war topics that allow Republicans to run up the score with rural white voters .
Democrats ’ pitch to working-class white voters is that they have plans to help them in concrete , material ways . But to deliver that help — whether it ’ s on health care , rural broadband , infrastructure , or anything else — Democrats need to be able to legislate .
If the reality of politics is that actual policy change is going to be extraordinarily rare and normally take the form of bipartisan deals negotiated behind closed doors , by contrast , then it arguably does make sense for voters to ignore their specific material interests and vote on the basis of hot-button symbolism instead .
In a majority-rule Senate , it would make sense to ask voters to elect senators — and a president — who will deliver Social Security expansion or revise antitrust law . But if the reality is that none of this stuff is actually on the table , then why not vote to signal your disapproval of Colin Kaepernick or the excesses of campus political correctness ?

That doesn ’ t change the fact that there are very real stakes in the 2020 presidential campaign . But it does mean those stakes relate more to foreign policy and executive branch appointments than they do to the big-picture legislative topics that have dominated the discussion thus far .","Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) thinks Democrats should end the filibuster if they regain the majority in the US Senate, and pass legislation by majority rule.

“When Democrats next have power, we should be bold and clear: We’re done with two sets of rules — one for the Republicans and one for the Democrats,” Warren says in advance text of a Friday speech to the National Action Network obtained by CNN. “And that means when Democrats have the White House again, if Mitch McConnell tries to do what he did to President Obama and puts small-minded partisanship ahead of solving the massive problems facing this country, then we should get rid of the filibuster.”

Warren is, of course, running for president and doubtless envisions herself as leading this charge from the White House. The Senate, however, makes its own rules, and a majority of senators could vote to change the rules and allow majority votes to prevail. If Democrats fare well in 2020, a rule change would greatly increase the likelihood that some of these big progressive ideas could come to fruition. But top Democrats are skeptical.

“We should not be doing anything to mess with the strength of the filibuster,” says Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ).

Most presidential candidates in the Senate are with Booker. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) says he’s “not crazy about getting rid of the filibuster.” His plan for Senate reform is statehood for the District of Columbia, which he thinks can be done because “I hope my Republican colleagues do the right thing.”

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) is “conflicted.” And Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) is concerned about the risks to being in the minority. “Having just lived through being in the minority,” she explains, “I just want to think long and hard about it.”

Candidates not in the Senate, by contrast, are more inclined to agree with Warren. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg is all for scrapping it, as is Washington Gov. Jay Inslee.

This debate is important because there’s no way almost anything the candidates are promising to do will happen unless the filibuster is lifted.

It’s up to the Senate to change its rules, not the president — Barack Obama’s calls for filibuster reform didn’t work, and neither have Donald Trump’s — and most of the candidates running are going to be back in the Senate after 2020. They show little appetite for reform.

Progressive politics right now is very focused on broad ideological visions. It hasn’t grappled with the reality that progressives are at a massive disadvantage in the upper chamber of Congress and no bold idea will make it through without a change.

A brief history of the filibuster

Fans of the filibuster often describe it as a noble and longstanding Senate tradition, evoking the image of Jimmy Stewart speaking for 25 hours straight to fight corruption in the movies. But the practice actually has a mostly sordid history. And its current usage serves as a de facto requirement that all bills clear a supermajority threshold.

In its earliest days, the US Senate lacked any procedural mechanism for forcing the end of debate on an issue. This was understood as a matter of collegiality in what was at the time a very small legislative body, and not as a requirement that legislation be unanimous. There were a handful of filibusters over the course of the 19th century (North Carolina Sen. William King organized an important 1841 filibuster of legislation to reauthorize the charter of the Second Bank of the United States), but in general, legislation passed by majority rule.

Things changed in 1917. Near the height of World War I, Germany announced a policy that its submarines would enforce a blockade of Britain-bound shipping by sinking any merchant vessels heading for the British Isles. In response, Woodrow Wilson and most members of Congress supported legislation that would arm American merchant ships. Sen. George Norris of Nebraska along with 11 colleagues filibustered the bill, and in response, Wilson urged the Senate to adopt a rule allowing for a supermajority of 67 senators to kill a filibuster.

This allowed Wilson’s wartime legislation to pass, but somewhat ironically, limiting filibusters served to somewhat normalize them, and it became routine for a Southern-based minority of senators to filibuster civil rights legislation.

Over the civil rights battles of the 1950s and ’60s, filibustering rules were tweaked several times until the modern filibuster rule emerged in the 1970s. The key features of the modern system are that it requires 60 affirmative votes to end debate on a topic but also that the Senate can simply move on to other issues without having formally invoked cloture on earlier issues. This turned filibustering into a less spectacular event than it had previously been — to filibuster a bill no longer meant holding up all bills — which in practice has served over time to encourage senators to do it more and more frequently.

As recently as the George W. Bush administration, however, it was still the case that not everything was filibustered. Both his 2003 Medicare reform bill and the nomination of Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court passed with more than 50 but fewer than 60 votes, though Democrats did also take the previously unprecedented step of filibustering federal appeals court nominees.

During the political standoff over these appeals court filibusters, some of us argued that Democrats should take advantage of Republican frustration to strike a high-minded compromise and return the Senate to the principle of majority rule.

But Democrats did not take that advice, only to find a few years later when Barack Obama was in office that Republicans were now holding everything to a 60-vote threshold. Constant filibustering shrank the size of the stimulus (consigning millions of people to years of additional unemployment), compromised the design of the Affordable Care Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, and doomed any effort to legislate on climate change or immigration reform.

Later, Republican filibustering of Obama’s nominees got so out of control that Senate Democrats felt compelled to change the rules and make filibustering of nominees impossible.

Under Trump, Republicans have taken advantage of that new rule set to get judges confirmed at a rapid pace. But Democratic filibusters have impeded Republican legislating, ensuring that even before Democrats took House in the 2018 midterms, the GOP could not pass legislation to build a wall or cut legal immigration.

The filibuster is probably bad for the left

Which party the filibuster advantages or disadvantages depends on the current state of politics — in 2005-2006, filibustering frustrated Republicans; in 2009-2010, it frustrated Democrats; in 2017-2018, Donald Trump issued the clearest call for filibuster abolition that we’ve seen from any president.

A separate question is whether a shift to majority rule would advantage one side over the other systematically over the long haul.

There is, of course, no real way to prove this. But historically, anti-filibuster sentiment has mostly come from the left. Even though policy obviously swings back and forth over time, there does tend to be a ratchet effect. The fight for women’s suffrage was long and difficult, but once women had the vote, taking it away was essentially impossible. A broadly similar dynamic tends to play out with social welfare programs as well.

UC Berkeley political scientist Paul Pierson explained in his 1994 book Dismantling the Welfare State? and his follow-up 1996 paper “The New Politics of the Welfare State” (and a 2017 interview with Vox) that even very successful conservative politicians like Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher generally fail to take away major social benefits once they’ve been created. Pierson argues that social programs create a new politics, and in particular build a constituency of people benefiting from the programs that is politically powerful and can resist efforts to dismantle them.

This is obviously not an ironclad law of nature. But the fact that Bush failed to privatize Social Security and Trump failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act tends to further support Pierson’s original analysis of Thatcher and Reagan. Note in particular that Bush’s Social Security plans never managed to pass the House, while Trump ACA repeal bills were eligible for a procedural maneuver that would have needed only a simple majority; in neither case did the filibuster save the welfare state’s bacon.

It’s very hard to create big new programs, but once they’re in place, they are hard to take away. There is, for example, vociferous disagreement about the political viability of a Big Bang switch away from the current US health insurance patchwork to a uniform single-payer system. But nobody thinks that if a single-payer system existed, it would be remotely viable to try to switch back to the current pastiche. Similarly, if you passed a law making it easier to form labor unions, that would lead to more unionized workers, which would make it harder to pass new anti-union laws.

Of course, even if you accept this logic, it’s still the case that some important specific progressive causes — the legality of late-term abortions or the continued existence of the diversity visa lottery — could be imperiled by ending filibusters.

More fundamentally, however, the filibuster’s existence is convenient for actual senators.

Supermajority rule makes life easier for senators

In his classic book Congress: The Electoral Connection, Yale political scientist David Mayhew makes the point that members of Congress are generally rewarded for “position-taking” rather than for achieving results.

And while the filibuster makes it harder to achieve results, precisely for that reason, it makes position-taking easier. A Democratic senator facing pressure from activists to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour might worry that his read of the economics literature is much more supportive of something like a $12 wage floor. But coming out for $12 would disappoint activists without meaningfully appeasing employer groups who oppose any increase whatsoever. The good news for our conflicted senator is that since it would take 60 votes for a bill to pass, there’s very little need to worry that even unanimous Democratic support for $15 an hour is going to produce a $15-an-hour minimum wage anytime soon.

If you decide that you want to side with the activists, in other words, you can just side with the activists and not worry too much about the details. A senator can even take a position in favor of some sweeping piece of legislation and then quietly reassure interest group opponents that everyone knows this isn’t getting 60 votes and really just represents an opening bid.

Senators in purple states, meanwhile, often enjoy the ability to avoid taking clear positions on issues. Since many areas of policy can, in practice, only be legislated on via bipartisan deals, it’s usually possible for a member to remain ambiguous whenever that seems most suitable.

Reform happens on the rare occasions when the imperative to actually make policy outweighs senators’ preference for position-taking. Wartime exigency in 1917 was such an example. The GOP using filibusters of nominations to render whole federal agencies inoperable was another. Democrats saying they wouldn’t confirm Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court simply because they didn’t like his jurisprudence was yet another.

Had Senate Republicans blocked any fiscal stimulus move in 2009, that might have prompted filibuster reform. But instead, Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe agreed to back a somewhat scaled-down package. Later, GOP filibusters of immigration and climate legislation were frustrating to progressives.

But fundamentally, the fact that bills on this topic would have to be bipartisan to pass was exactly what most Democratic members found appealing about the filibuster rule.

Democrats have big ideas but no plan

Rightly or wrongly, Democrats headed into the Obama years with the expectation that they’d be able to do to a lot of substantive legislation on a bipartisan basis.

The Affordable Care Act drew inspiration from several ideas that had attracted Republican support in the past, and during the Bush years, both carbon emissions reduction bills and comprehensive immigration reform bills had received support from a non-trivial minority of GOP legislators. Similarly, for years his administration aspired to achieve some kind of bipartisan “grand bargain” on the long-term budget deficit that would pair tax increases on the wealthy with cuts to Social Security and Medicare spending.

This was all proven mostly false by the end of Obama’s first term. Still, Obama harbored hope that securing reelection would “break the fever” and unlock the doors to bipartisan cooperation. For a brief moment in 2013, it even seemed like that might be true, until conservative opposition torpedoed a once-promising bipartisan immigration reform bill.

Today’s Democrats no longer frame proposals around bipartisan legislative strategies that nobody believes will work. But Warren’s words aside, there’s also no indication that Democratic senators — including many of the authors of the main ambitious proposals that have dominated the policy debate — are taking any steps to move the Senate to a majority rules basis. Nor do they seem content to limit aspirations to the kind of changes that could qualify for the budget reconciliation loophole. There is, however, no realistic chance that Democrats are going to pick up 13 Senate seats in 2020.

Indeed, even taking a majority would be a stretch.

Every Senate map is bad for Democrats

A perennial cliché of 2018 midterms coverage was that Democrats faced a bad “map” in the Senate, with many of their incumbents up for reelection, often in tough states.

And, indeed, the map was so bad that even in the context of the party winning a huge landslide in the House popular vote, they actually lost Senate seats. The 2020 map will be, relative to 2018, considerably kinder.

There is one highly vulnerable Democratic incumbent (Doug Jones in Alabama) and one highly vulnerable Republican (Cory Gardner in Colorado), plus a handful of plausible Democratic pickups in Arizona, Georgia, Iowa, North Carolina, Maine, and maybe Texas, with really nothing plausibly on the board for the GOP.

A more pessimistic way of looking at it, however, would be this. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won the national popular vote by a healthy 2 percentage points. Nevertheless, she only carried 20 states out of 50. Three of those states — Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin — were very close, so a slight improvement on her 2-point win would get Democrats to 23. Then there’s Florida, which she lost by 1.2 points, and North Carolina, which she lost by 3.7 points.

Assuming a uniform swing, in other words, a Democratic presidential candidate would need to win the national popular vote by almost 6 percentage points in order to carry half the states. That’s not impossible to pull off — Obama did it in 2008, Bill Clinton did in 1996, and George H.W. Bush did in 1988 — but it’s certainly rare. And this means Democrats are going to perennially struggle to obtain a Senate majority. It’s not out of the question that Democrats will hold 50 seats after 2020, but to get them, they’ll need to win multiple races in states that Clinton lost by 4 to 5 points and knock off a popular moderate incumbent in Maine — winning a majority of votes nationwide won’t be good enough.

The problem, to a first approximation, is that America’s largest states — California, Texas, New York, and Florida — all have significantly more non-Hispanic whites than the national average. That ends up meaning that most states are whiter than the national average, meaning white voters — and, as it turns out, specifically rural and less-educated white voters — are significantly overrepresented in the Senate map.

Filibuster reform could be a plan

This Senate disadvantage arguably strengthens the progressive case for keeping the filibuster, since if you expect the GOP to hold the majority most of the time, then majority rule voting could only empower Republicans. But there are two offsetting considerations.

One is that the underrepresentation of voters of color in the Senate could be partially rectified by turning DC and Puerto Rico into states, but to do that, you’d need to overcome GOP filibusters. The other is that arguably filibustering itself — by making it hard to pass legislation — encourages politics to focus on the hazy culture war topics that allow Republicans to run up the score with rural white voters.

Democrats’ pitch to working-class white voters is that they have plans to help them in concrete, material ways. But to deliver that help — whether it’s on health care, rural broadband, infrastructure, or anything else — Democrats need to be able to legislate.

If the reality of politics is that actual policy change is going to be extraordinarily rare and normally take the form of bipartisan deals negotiated behind closed doors, by contrast, then it arguably does make sense for voters to ignore their specific material interests and vote on the basis of hot-button symbolism instead.

In a majority-rule Senate, it would make sense to ask voters to elect senators — and a president — who will deliver Social Security expansion or revise antitrust law. But if the reality is that none of this stuff is actually on the table, then why not vote to signal your disapproval of Colin Kaepernick or the excesses of campus political correctness?

But so far, there is no indication that Senate Democrats as a group are taking the possibility of filibuster reform even remotely seriously. Even members who were vocal and active on the issue in the mid-Obama years have largely gone dormant.

That doesn’t change the fact that there are very real stakes in the 2020 presidential campaign. But it does mean those stakes relate more to foreign policy and executive branch appointments than they do to the big-picture legislative topics that have dominated the discussion thus far.",www.vox.com,left,ErXriWSEF4WJ7tzu

The Senate GOP dissenters — Lamar Alexander , Roy Blunt , Susan Collins , Mike Lee , Jerry Moran , Lisa Murkowski , Rand Paul , Rob Portman , Mitt Romney , Marco Rubio , Pat Toomey , and Roger Wicker— ran the ideological gamut from conservative to moderate . Most argued that the president was operating outside the rule of law , while some simply called the emergency declaration an executive overreach that Congress had a duty to stop .
“ Never before has a president asked for funding , Congress has not provided it , and the president then has used the National Emergencies Act of 1976 to spend the money anyway , ” read a statement from Alexander , who plans to retire after three terms representing Tennessee rather than seek reelection next year . “ The problem with this is that after a Revolutionary War against a king , our nation ’ s founders gave to Congress the power to approve all spending so that the president would not have too much power . This check on the executive is a crucial source of our freedom . ”
Collins , the moderate from Maine who is the only senator facing a 2020 reelection campaign among the twelve Republicans to vote for the resolution , argued in a floor speech that Trump ’ s declaration failed to pass the longstanding five-part test of a genuine emergency : “ necessary , sudden , urgent , unforeseen , and not permanent . ”
“ This is a vote for the Constitution and for the balance of powers that is at its core . For the Executive Branch to override a law passed by Congress would make it the ultimate power rather than a balancing power , ” said Romney , who took a hard-line stance against illegal immigration during his 2012 presidential campaign , in a statement . “ This is not a vote against border security . In fact , I agree that a physical barrier is urgently needed to help ease the humanitarian crisis at the southern border , and the administration already has $ 4.5 billion available within existing authority to fund a barrier—even without an emergency declaration . ”
Romney ’ s fellow Utahn , Mike Lee , thought Trump ’ s declaration was legal under the 1976 National Emergencies Act and was willing to uphold it if the law could be changed to curb the power it gives the executive . When a deal to pass Lee ’ s Article One Act , which would have satisfied his concerns , fell through , he decided to vote “ no . ”
Two of the more surprising votes against terminating the national emergency were those cast by Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Ben Sasse of Nebraska , both of whom face reelection in 2020 . Tillis had been expressing disapproval of the emergency declaration for weeks , while Sasse has generally voiced more public criticism of President Trump than any other Republican in the Senate .
Sasse said in a statement that the National Emergencies Act ( NEA ) is “ overly broad and I want to fix it , but at present Nancy Pelosi doesn ’ t , so I am therefore voting against her politically motivated resolution . As a constitutional conservative , I believe that the NEA currently on the books should be narrowed considerably . That ’ s why I ’ m an original sponsor of Senator Lee ’ s legislation , and it is why I have repeatedly gone to the White House to seek support for NEA reform. ” On Wednesday , Pelosi shot down any deal to pass Lee ’ s bill and uphold Trump ’ s emergency declaration .
Republican senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas , who voted to uphold the emergency , spoke for the vast majority of Senate Republicans when he took the floor to argue that there is a genuine emergency on the Southern border and that President Trump ’ s declaration was both legal and proper . “ Since last October , Border Patrol agents have apprehended more than 260,000 illegal aliens at the border , a surge of 90 percent — almost double —from the previous year , ” he said . “ He [ Trump ] is only exercising the statutory authority delegated to him by us . By this very body , the United States Congress . More than half of the $ 8.1 billion the president is using to build the wall and secure the border comes from non-emergency statutes passed by Congress . ”
While Cotton said he respects colleagues who worry about a slippery slope , he dismissed that objection because Congress has “ not delegated to the executive the power to confiscate guns , close power plants , or any of the other common entrants in the parade of horribles on the slippery slope . That ’ s the difference between lawful and lawless government , and it ’ s the case here . ”
“ If you want to see lawless executive action , by the way , you can look instead to the last administration , ” Cotton added . “ President Obama purported to give millions of illegal aliens legal status and work permits in clear violation of statutes passed by Congress . Strange how I don ’ t recall the self-styled ‘ Resistance ’ manning the ramparts and rushing to the Ninth Circuit back then . In fact , I only recall congressional fanboys of a president using the ‘ pen and phone ’ to encroach on our constitutional prerogatives . ”
In 2014 , when the House voted to rescind President Obama ’ s DACA program for illegal immigrants who arrived as minors , only four Democrats joined most Republicans to rebuke what many said was an unconstitutional action .

Calls for Walsh to bow out have grown louder following accusations that first surfaced last month that he plagiarized part of a paper he submitted for his master 's degree in 2007 .
Three of Montana 's largest newspapers recently called for him to withdraw his candidacy , while others have demanded he apologize or forfeit his master 's degree .
The decision comes as a U.S. Army War College investigation is set to begin Aug. 15 into the paper that Walsh previously said unintentionally contained wrongfully cited passages . Walsh also had until Monday to drop out of the race .
His decision to withdraw from the November election allows the Montana Democratic Party to hold a nominating convention to choose a replacement candidate before the Aug. 20 deadline to do so . The convention will be composed of Democratic leaders from each county 's party committee , along with federal and statewide elected officials and the party 's executive board . They will nominate potential candidates who will have a chance to speak before the convention before voting gets underway .
The nominee who receives a majority of votes will be selected as the replacement candidate , according to the party 's rules .
Walsh 's decision is likely to give a boost to Republican Rep. Steve Daines , who is giving up his House seat to run for Senate . Republicans need to gain a net of six seats in the election to take control of the Senate , and Walsh had faced a tough race against Daines before the plagiarism allegations .
Walsh had already announced his candidacy for the seat when Gov . Steve Bullock appointed him in February to replace Max Baucus , who resigned from the Senate to become ambassador to China . Republicans blasted Bullock 's appointment of his lieutenant governor as a political move designed to gain an advantage in the elections .
The New York Times revealed the extensive use of unattributed material in Walsh 's paper about the spread of democracy in the Middle East . Walsh originally called it an `` unintentional mistake '' and told The Associated Press part of the blame may lie in his being treated for symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder following his deployment in Iraq .
He later said he was not blaming PTSD for his mistake .

AMY GOODMAN : In an historic defeat for the Republican Party , the Senate voted 49 to 51 early this morning against a bill that would have repealed key parts of the Affordable Care Act .
SEN. DAVID PERDUE : The ayes are 49 . The nays are 51 . The motion is not agreed to . The amendment is not agreed to .
AMY GOODMAN : As the bill was defeated , protesters outside the Capitol cheered and chanted “ Yes , we did ! ” The loss was a stinging defeat for President Trump and for Republicans who have spent seven years vowing to repeal and replace Obamacare . This is Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , in the Senate chamber , conceding defeat around 2:00 a.m. Eastern time .
MAJORITY LEADER MITCH McCONNELL : I also want to thank the president and the vice president , who couldn ’ t have been more involved and more helpful . So , yes , this is a disappointment . A disappointment indeed . Our friends over in the House , we thank them , as well . I regret that our efforts were simply not enough this time .
AMY GOODMAN : The so-called skinny repeal of Obamacare would have eliminated the individual and employer mandate , that requires certain businesses to provide health insurance to employees . Its defeat came after the Congressional Budget Office said it would have added another 16 million people to the ranks of the uninsured and increased premiums by at least 20 percent . The bill was only made public around 10:00 p.m. Eastern time Thursday night , giving senators only a few hours to review it before they had to vote . Joining every Democrat in opposing the measure were Republicans Susan Collins of Maine , Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and an ailing Arizona Senator John McCain , who had returned to Washington this week after surgery for and being diagnosed with brain cancer .
SEN. JOHN McCAIN : Right now , as I mentioned earlier , I am voting no , unless I see that there is a path to a conference that will come out with a result that will address the challenges . The status quo in my state is unsatisfactory . That ’ s why I ’ m working with the governor of my state , who has proposed three different amendments , which I will be putting up for bills—votes , as we go through . And if it satisfies the governor , then I would be satisfied . Right now , my governor is not satisfied .
AMY GOODMAN : When the actual vote came , it was Senator McCain , standing in the floor of the Senate , who gave a—with a pause , a thumbs down . There was a gasp in the Senate chamber . Senator Charles Schumer shushed the Democrats from cheering . Senator McCain ’ s vote derailed what at one point seemed a likely victory for Trump . In [ 2015 ] , then-candidate Trump said of McCain , who was held as a prisoner of war in Vietnam for over five years , “ He was a war hero because he was captured . I like people who weren ’ t captured . … He ’ s been losing so long , he doesn ’ t know how to win anymore , ” Trump said back then .
Meanwhile , this morning , President Trump responded to the defeat on Twitter , writing , quote , “ 3 Republicans and 48 Democrats let the American people down . As I said from the beginning , let ObamaCare implode , then deal . Watch ! ” he said .
For now , the healthcare debate appears to be over . The Senate has adjourned , and there are no further votes this week .
For more , we go to Washington , D.C. , where we ’ re joined by Margarida Jorge , co-executive director of Health Care for America Now .
Welcome to ███ ! , Margarida . Can you talk about what took place just hours ago ?
MARGARIDA JORGE : Well , certainly , Senator McCain has long had a reputation as a maverick . And I think some of us were questioning that earlier in the week , when he voted in favor of the motion to proceed , and then gave an impassioned speech about the very secretive and , you know , corrupt process by which this whole repeal effort has moved forward . And the press conference that he and his colleagues , Lindsey Graham and Ron Johnson from Wisconsin , gave just hours before he voted against the bill , again , just—I think Senator McCaskill , from my old state of Missouri , said it well , when she said , “ Working in the Senate right now is like being in the Twilight Zone. ” What I—
AMY GOODMAN : Well , let me go to that press conference ahead of the vote—it was yesterday afternoon—when Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina threatened to pull support from the so-called skinny bill .
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM : Here ’ s the problem . The whip in the House is suggesting to some that whatever we send becomes the final product , there will be no conference . And I am not going to vote for the skinny bill if I am not assured by the House there will be a conference , where my idea and other ideas can be taken up so we can actually replace Obamacare . I ’ m not going to vote for a bill that is terrible policy and horrible politics , just because we have to get something done .
AMY GOODMAN : That was Republican Senator Lindsey Graham . He went on to call the skinny bill a “ fraud . ”
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM : The skinny bill , as policy , is a disaster . The skinny bill , as a replacement for Obamacare , is a fraud . The skinny bill is a vehicle to get in conference to find a replacement . It is not a replacement in , of itself . The policy is terrible , because you eliminate the individual , employer mandate , which we all want eliminated , but we actually have a overall solution to the problem of Obamacare . So you ’ re going to have increased premiums , and most of Obamacare stays in place , if the skinny bill becomes law . Not only do we not replace Obamacare , we politically own the collapse of healthcare . I ’ d rather get out of the way and let it collapse than have a half-ass approach where it is now our problem .
AMY GOODMAN : Interestingly , Lindsey Graham , after calling the skinny bill a “ fraud ” and a “ disaster , ” actually voted for it . But the man he was standing next to , who came out with his warning , as well , that he wouldn ’ t vote for this unless they got a guarantee from House Speaker Ryan that the House would not just adopt the Senate bill , the man standing next to Lindsey Graham at that news conference , John McCain , voted against it . Margarida Jorge , so what happens now ?
MARGARIDA JORGE : Well , I mean , I think a couple of things happen now . So , one thing is that President Trump ’ s comment , his tweet following the vote , that Obamacare , we should just wait for Obamacare to collapse , is not an arbitrary comment . It ’ s a comment that he has made many , many times : It ’ s going to implode , it ’ s going to collapse , it ’ s going to this , it ’ s going to that . And the reality is that Obamacare is fine , right ? What he ’ s really saying is that he and his administration will do everything in their power to make sure that they do not enforce and protect this law , even though that is their job , since they run HHS .
And so , you know , one key thing , as you ’ ve been saying and Senator Graham just said , that would have been rolled back in the vote would have been the individual mandate . But the truth is , at the national level , President Trump and HHS have already stopped enforcing the individual mandate . And they have absolutely every intention of making sure that they sabotage Obamacare . We ’ re already starting to see spikes in premiums . And we know the insurance industry has commented over and over and over again that what ’ s driving these increases in premiums is not collapse of the law , it ’ s uncertainty in the market that ’ s being driven by the repeal efforts , the president ’ s refusal to enforce the law and his noncommittal stance toward cost-sharing reduction payments , that are essential to lowering costs for consumers in the law and helping insurers to be able to provide the coverage . And so , that cost-sharing reduction and sabotage is still out there . That ’ s going to be critical .
And the second thing that ’ s still out there is the attacks that we ’ re seeing on Medicaid and Medicare in the House—in the House budget on the GOP side . In earlier versions of this law—of the repeal bill , we saw not just a repeal of the Affordable Care Act , not just a rolling back of the expansion of Medicaid in states , in the 31 states that expanded , but an outright attack on the traditional Medicaid program—that ’ s turning 52 , by the way , this weekend . And this is the program that ’ s providing healthcare to seniors , over 70 million seniors , children , people with disabilities , veterans , low-income people . And the proposal has been—all of these repeal proposals have had the proposal to create caps in Medicaid that would make dramatic changes in the program , permanently cut its funding . We see that very same proposal , except deeper cuts in the House budget , that ’ s moving at the same time that we ’ ve all been following the repeal debate . And so , the healthcare fight is really far from over , because we can expect $ 1.5 trillion in cuts , is what ’ s being proposed to Medicaid in the Republican budget , and another almost $ 500 billion cut to Medicare , which the Republicans are proposing to voucherize and privatize in the bill .
So , our view is that we are going to see many different kinds of attacks from many different sectors on healthcare . And the Trump sabotage piece of this is something that a lot of folks are not paying attention to . It ’ s critical . The sabotage of the law , and perpetuating its failure , is what the conservatives will then use as their rationale for taking a second try at repeal in the coming months .
AMY GOODMAN : As the amendments flew in the Senate Thursday , lawmakers voted down a single-payer healthcare amendment introduced by Republican Senator Steve Daines , who said it was aimed at putting Senate Democrats on the record on the issue . But Senator Bernie Sanders , longtime supporter of single payer , Medicare for all , denounced the amendment as a political trick designed to embarrass Democrats ahead of the healthcare vote .
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS : To Senator Daines , if he is prepared to vote for this legislation , and if he can get maybe five , six more Republicans to vote for this legislation , I think we can win it . And I think the United States can join the rest of the industrialized world and finally guarantee healthcare to all people .
AMY GOODMAN : So , the amendment failed to pass , after no lawmakers from either party voted for it . But , of course , we know Senator Sanders is a big proponent of Medicare for all . Margarida Jorge , what happens with that ? And will Democrats move forward with that , like the Conyers bill in the House ?
MARGARIDA JORGE : Well , I think Democrats will—there ’ s certainly a lot of openness to the bigger solutions to healthcare . You know , for years , we ’ ve been doing regulation and these kind of smaller fix-its here or there , but I think there ’ s growing recognition that the system itself is a problem because it ’ s driven not by healthcare , but by profit . And mostly what we ’ re having in this country is a conversation about the health insurance industry , not a conversation about actual healthcare . So , I think there is growing openness .
I mean , frankly , whether or not Democrats take up Medicare for all , whether or not they take up negotiations for prescription drug companies—another great bill that Senator Sanders has sponsored—really depends on grassroots pressure , in the same way that stopping repeal has really depended upon grassroots pressure . You know , this is still the United States . It ’ s still a democracy . If the citizenry , if constituents want something , it is up to us to organize impacted people and to show up and to make that demand , especially in district , where we have the greatest access to members . And it ’ s not different . You know , the same level of grassroots pressure that we saw around stopping repeal , that we expect to see around stopping the cuts to Medicaid and Medicare in order to give huge tax breaks to rich people in the budget fight , if we want Medicare for all , then we ’ ve got to go to Senator Sanders , and we ’ ve got to go to a lot of senators and show that the demand for that is out there .
AMY GOODMAN : Margarida Jorge , I want to thank you for being with us , co-executive director of Health Care for [ America ] Now and Health Care for [ America ] Now Education Fund .
This is ███ ! When we come back , we go to Des Moines , Iowa . Two women , two Catholic Workers , admit they committed sabotage against the Dakota Access pipeline . They ’ ll tell their story . Stay with us .","This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

The policy is terrible, because you eliminate the individual, employer mandate, which we all want eliminated, but we actually have a overall solution to the problem of Obamacare. So you’re going to have increased premiums, and most of Obamacare stays in place, if the skinny bill becomes law. Not only do we not replace Obamacare, we politically own the collapse of healthcare. I’d rather get out of the way and let it collapse than have a half-ass approach where it is now our problem.

AMY GOODMAN: Interestingly, Lindsey Graham, after calling the skinny bill a “fraud” and a “disaster,” actually voted for it. But the man he was standing next to, who came out with his warning, as well, that he wouldn’t vote for this unless they got a guarantee from House Speaker Ryan that the House would not just adopt the Senate bill, the man standing next to Lindsey Graham at that news conference, John McCain, voted against it. Margarida Jorge, so what happens now?

MARGARIDA JORGE: Well, I mean, I think a couple of things happen now. So, one thing is that President Trump’s comment, his tweet following the vote, that Obamacare, we should just wait for Obamacare to collapse, is not an arbitrary comment. It’s a comment that he has made many, many times: It’s going to implode, it’s going to collapse, it’s going to this, it’s going to that. And the reality is that Obamacare is fine, right? What he’s really saying is that he and his administration will do everything in their power to make sure that they do not enforce and protect this law, even though that is their job, since they run HHS.

And so, you know, one key thing, as you’ve been saying and Senator Graham just said, that would have been rolled back in the vote would have been the individual mandate. But the truth is, at the national level, President Trump and HHS have already stopped enforcing the individual mandate. And they have absolutely every intention of making sure that they sabotage Obamacare. We’re already starting to see spikes in premiums. And we know the insurance industry has commented over and over and over again that what’s driving these increases in premiums is not collapse of the law, it’s uncertainty in the market that’s being driven by the repeal efforts, the president’s refusal to enforce the law and his noncommittal stance toward cost-sharing reduction payments, that are essential to lowering costs for consumers in the law and helping insurers to be able to provide the coverage. And so, that cost-sharing reduction and sabotage is still out there. That’s going to be critical.

And the second thing that’s still out there is the attacks that we’re seeing on Medicaid and Medicare in the House—in the House budget on the GOP side. In earlier versions of this law—of the repeal bill, we saw not just a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, not just a rolling back of the expansion of Medicaid in states, in the 31 states that expanded, but an outright attack on the traditional Medicaid program—that’s turning 52, by the way, this weekend. And this is the program that’s providing healthcare to seniors, over 70 million seniors, children, people with disabilities, veterans, low-income people. And the proposal has been—all of these repeal proposals have had the proposal to create caps in Medicaid that would make dramatic changes in the program, permanently cut its funding. We see that very same proposal, except deeper cuts in the House budget, that’s moving at the same time that we’ve all been following the repeal debate. And so, the healthcare fight is really far from over, because we can expect $1.5 trillion in cuts, is what’s being proposed to Medicaid in the Republican budget, and another almost $500 billion cut to Medicare, which the Republicans are proposing to voucherize and privatize in the bill.

So, our view is that we are going to see many different kinds of attacks from many different sectors on healthcare. And the Trump sabotage piece of this is something that a lot of folks are not paying attention to. It’s critical. The sabotage of the law, and perpetuating its failure, is what the conservatives will then use as their rationale for taking a second try at repeal in the coming months.

AMY GOODMAN: As the amendments flew in the Senate Thursday, lawmakers voted down a single-payer healthcare amendment introduced by Republican Senator Steve Daines, who said it was aimed at putting Senate Democrats on the record on the issue. But Senator Bernie Sanders, longtime supporter of single payer, Medicare for all, denounced the amendment as a political trick designed to embarrass Democrats ahead of the healthcare vote.

SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: To Senator Daines, if he is prepared to vote for this legislation, and if he can get maybe five, six more Republicans to vote for this legislation, I think we can win it. And I think the United States can join the rest of the industrialized world and finally guarantee healthcare to all people.

AMY GOODMAN: So, the amendment failed to pass, after no lawmakers from either party voted for it. But, of course, we know Senator Sanders is a big proponent of Medicare for all. Margarida Jorge, what happens with that? And will Democrats move forward with that, like the Conyers bill in the House?

MARGARIDA JORGE: Well, I think Democrats will—there’s certainly a lot of openness to the bigger solutions to healthcare. You know, for years, we’ve been doing regulation and these kind of smaller fix-its here or there, but I think there’s growing recognition that the system itself is a problem because it’s driven not by healthcare, but by profit. And mostly what we’re having in this country is a conversation about the health insurance industry, not a conversation about actual healthcare. So, I think there is growing openness.

I mean, frankly, whether or not Democrats take up Medicare for all, whether or not they take up negotiations for prescription drug companies—another great bill that Senator Sanders has sponsored—really depends on grassroots pressure, in the same way that stopping repeal has really depended upon grassroots pressure. You know, this is still the United States. It’s still a democracy. If the citizenry, if constituents want something, it is up to us to organize impacted people and to show up and to make that demand, especially in district, where we have the greatest access to members. And it’s not different. You know, the same level of grassroots pressure that we saw around stopping repeal, that we expect to see around stopping the cuts to Medicaid and Medicare in order to give huge tax breaks to rich people in the budget fight, if we want Medicare for all, then we’ve got to go to Senator Sanders, and we’ve got to go to a lot of senators and show that the demand for that is out there.

Rather than coming up with his own solution to the impending expiration of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) program , which is currently protecting from deportation some 690,000 people who arrived in the US as children , Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell threw the matter to the Senate floor , letting any senator offer amendments addressing the issue .
Some amendments were hardline , designed to reduce levels of legal immigration . But the most interesting ones were bipartisan compromises , some of which seemed capable of earning 60 votes and making it to the House of Representatives .
Then on Thursday , those amendments failed , and the process , such as it was , died . There is still a little bit of time left before March 5 , the date the Trump administration has set as the de facto deadline for passing a fix . But hopes of reaching a deal that protects DACA recipients , and potentially millions of other unauthorized immigrants , are fading .
Here ’ s who gained from the stalemate , and who ended the debate worse off than they were before .
This entire showdown was Donald Trump ’ s choice — a choice heavily influenced by Miller , who has emerged as his main adviser on immigration policy .
Trump could have chosen to continue DACA if he wanted to do so . It was an executive action undertaken by President Barack Obama , and Trump had just as much authority to maintain the policy as Obama had to institute it in the first place . There were judicial conservatives who doubted Obama ’ s order was legal , but if Trump wanted to maintain the policy he could ’ ve defended the order in court and obeyed whatever the Supreme Court ’ s ultimate judgment on the matter was .
Instead , he took matters into his own hands , canceled DACA in September , and essentially turned the fates of the 690,000 people the program is helping into bargaining chips .
He could ’ ve used those chips for any number of things : to get Democratic support to make parts of last year ’ s tax cuts bill permanent , to dismantle more of Obamacare , to get his infrastructure plan passed .
Instead , he has tied support for DACA recipient relief ( and relief for the larger group of 1.8 million DREAMers who arrived as children ) to massive funding for a border wall with Mexico and some of the sharpest limitations on legal immigration since the 1920s .
The Secure and Succeed Act of 2018 , Trump and Miller ’ s preferred solution backed by a group of seven Republican senators led by Chuck Grassley ( R-IA ) , would commit $ 25 billion to build a wall , eliminate the 55,000-person diversity visa program ( which is responsible for most African immigration to the US ) , and eliminate the ability of parents , adult children , and siblings of US citizens to join their family members here .
That is , Trump and Miller offered Democrats and moderate Republicans relief for DREAMers — but their price was a gutting of the legal immigration system , a dramatic reduction in the number of people who can legally move to this country .
In case you worried they weren ’ t serious , they issued a veto threat against the competing plan that was likeliest to pass the Senate : the “ Common Sense Caucus ” proposal , produced by Sens . Mike Rounds ( R-SD ) , Angus King ( I-ME ) , and Susan Collins ( R-ME ) , which would provide relief for the 1.8 million who came as children and $ 25 billion for border security but not gut the legal immigration system .
All the proposals failed , and the Grassley proposal failed particularly badly , gaining only 39 votes , compared to 54 for the Common Sense plan . So Trump has not been successful , yet , in trading DREAMer relief for cutbacks on legal immigration .
But he and Miller have nonetheless succeeded in taking complete control of this debate . They could ’ ve conceded that they were out of step with the Senate and endorsed the Rounds-King-Collins plan . It was a genuinely moderate proposal that some conservative Republicans like Rounds had endorsed . It would ’ ve gotten Trump his border wall and stopped DREAMers from sponsoring their parents for citizenship . At the same time , it would ’ ve signaled that Trump personally is not running the show and is willing to take cues from Republicans in Congress rather than sticking up for his own vision .
Instead , Miller ’ s hardline stance won out , Trump retains the 690,000 DACA recipients as bargaining chips , and he demonstrated that he could shut down compelling , popular compromise plans in the Senate by threatening a veto . Even if he doesn ’ t ultimately get all the legal immigration cuts he wants , achieving them looks far more possible now than it ever has before .
“ It ’ s now clear that the most contentious question in Congress is one that ’ s been dormant in legislative fights for years : whether or not to cut legal immigration , ” my colleague Dara Lind explained . “ This is almost entirely the doing of President Donald Trump . Over the course of two and a half years , as a candidate , nominee , and now president , he ’ s turned a fringe right-wing view into the heart of the current congressional debate over immigration . ”
If that ’ s not a victory for a political actor , I don ’ t know what is .
One of the hardest parts of being a Republican speaker of the House is that , for reasons that remain mysterious even to the GOP caucus , you have to obey a decades-old rule named after a child molester that makes it impossible to get tough compromises passed .
Under the Hastert Rule , the speaker won ’ t allow a vote on legislation unless it has the support of a “ majority of the majority ” in the House . That means that legislation that , say , a minority of Republicans and all Democrats support can not come to the floor even if it could pass the House . There have been times when speakers violated the rule ( John Boehner memorably did so both to pass a deal to avert the “ fiscal cliff ” at the end of 2012 and to end the 2013 government shutdown ) , but they ’ re relatively rare .
And the rule has a particularly tortured history when it comes to immigration . In 2013 , bipartisan immigration reform passed the Senate with 68 votes , a truly massive margin . It would ’ ve provided a path to citizenship for the 11 million-odd Americans who came here illegally , cleared the visa application backlog , expanded visas for both low-skilled agricultural and high-skilled STEM workers , and spent more on border security and employer verification of legal status .
The plan likely had majority support in the House too — but because it didn ’ t have majority support among Republicans , Boehner didn ’ t bring it up for a vote , and it died . It was the last best shot for comprehensive reform , and it died because the House leadership took a hard line .
Taking that line wasn ’ t always easy for Boehner , who faced criticism from normal allies like the Chamber of Commerce and knew that killing a popular bipartisan bill could hurt his public image .
And with the current debate , Speaker Paul Ryan has found himself in Boehner ’ s shoes . He doesn ’ t want to run afoul of Trump by backing a more moderate deal . But he also doesn ’ t want to be blamed for deportations of DACA recipients if it comes to that . If push came to shove , he most likely would ’ ve chosen not to schedule a vote on anything the Senate passed that fell short of Trump ’ s standards and taken the heat . That said , if he could avoid the situation entirely , that would be even better .
By defeating every proposal , the Senate gave Ryan a massive out and allowed him to avoid having to exercise agency — to show actual leadership of some kind — in this debate . He can continue trying to avoid the topic , bragging about tax cuts , and twiddling his thumbs while hundreds of thousands of Americans ’ fates hang in the balance .
Parents of the 690,000 Americans threatened with deportation if DACA lapses without replacement are , in general , in a tough situation . Many , if not most , of them are in the US without authorization themselves , which puts them at risk of deportation unless a broader legalization program ( like the 2013 bill the Senate passed ) is adopted . And even if they still live abroad , their children face the prospect of being uprooted from the only home they ever knew , which should concern any parent .
But worse than that , during the current debate , DACA parents have found themselves identified as villains — or , if not villains , then a problem that policymakers are trying to avoid . Due to Trump administration concerns about “ chain migration , ” the Grassley bill would have completely eliminated the ability of children to sponsor their parents for green cards . That takes away the possibility of DACA parents gaining permanent residency after their children achieve permanent residency or even citizenship .
Suppose a mother moved from the Philippines to the US with a 2-year-old daughter and overstayed her visa . Now , living in the US , she has another daughter . Her older daughter might be eligible for DACA — but her second would definitely be a US citizen and under current law could , potentially , sponsor her for a green card . If the Grassley bill passed , that avenue would have been foreclosed too .
The Grassley bill went down in flames . But even the much more plausible Common Sense Caucus plan would ’ ve placed limits on familial migration by barring DACA recipients from sponsoring their parents for legal status . So that Filipino mom would have to be sponsored by a US citizen kid — and if she didn ’ t have one , she ’ d be out of luck .
As the Migration Policy Institute ‘ s Julia Gelatt and Randy Capps explain , many DACA parents are likely not eligible for sponsorship regardless . “ Realistically , only parents who overstayed legal visas or those residing outside of the country would likely be able to obtain a green card , ” they write , because parents who entered illegally are required to leave the country and wait for three or 10 years to apply for another visa .
Even given that limitation , they estimate that on average , each DACA recipient or DREAMer who is formally legalized will sponsor 0.28 parents for legal status , after they wait five years or more to gain citizenship themselves . If only the 690,000 people now on DACA do this , that ’ s still nearly 200,000 parents who wouldn ’ t be sponsored if a measure like the Grassley or Common Sense Caucus bills passes . Some of them could be sponsored by a US citizen child of theirs , but others would simply be out of luck .
These measures aren ’ t law yet . But when even the moderate one promises to make life more difficult for parents of DACA recipients , that ’ s reason for worry .
In January , Judge William Alsup of the Northern District of California issued an injunction blocking Trump temporarily from overturning DACA , saying there ’ s reason to believe that Trump violated the Administrative Procedure Act by using such a hasty decision process to rescind the program . It was a shocking decision that kept the program on temporary life support , without ensuring its long-run survival .
And , naturally , it was immediately appealed up to the Supreme Court . The Court is set to conference this week on the matter , and to decide whether and when to review Alsup ’ s order , and a similar one issued by Judge Nicholas Garaufis of the Eastern District of New York , stand as legal challenges to the program make their way through the courts .
If Congress had agreed to a deal to offer relief to DACA recipients , the Court would have had a simple out : declaring the issue moot , as new laws made the debate over whether the Administrative Procedure Act was violated irrelevant . But now , it will be forced to rule on a highly contentious , partisan dispute between the branches . The Court has a small-c conservative streak , attempting in most cases to stay out of bitter partisan controversies for fear of losing legitimacy . On DACA , it looks like they won ’ t be able to .
Few figures in Washington have supplicated themselves more completely , and in more humiliating fashion , to Donald Trump than Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R-SC ) . During the 2016 primary , in which Graham briefly ran ( he really did , though I forgive you for not remembering ) , he denounced Trump as a “ kook , ” “ crazy , ” “ unfit for office , ” and “ the most flawed nominee in the history of the Republican Party , ” even saying his nomination would mean the death of the party . Trump reciprocated the loathing , even revealing Graham ’ s personal cellphone number at a rally as a kind of revenge .

In November , Graham refused to vote for Trump , casting a ballot for independent conservative Evan McMullin instead .

Great day of fun playing with @ POTUS @ realDonaldTrump . https : //t.co/92Xjk8d8B2 — Lindsey Graham ( @ LindseyGrahamSC ) December 10 , 2017
At one point in November , Graham lambasted critics who tried to “ label the guy some kind of kook not fit to be president , ” despite the fact that he himself had called Trump a kook who was not fit to be president . More substantively , he referred Christopher Steele , the author of the infamous Trump-Russia dossier leaked by BuzzFeed in January 2017 , to the Justice Department for criminal investigation , a meaningful act of loyalty to the president and sign he ’ ll look the other way at any possible untoward ties with Russia .
It was never super clear why Graham was suddenly sucking up to Trump . But it became clearer at an televised immigration conference in January .
At the meeting , on camera , Graham urged Trump to support a pathway to citizenship for DACA recipients , citing polls showing that Trump ’ s voters supported the move , noting that it would be tough and would face right-wing radio opposition but that Trump could help them finally pass something . “ You have created an opportunity here , Mr. President , and you need to close the deal , ” he said .
Then a couple of days later , Trump decided to call African nations “ shitholes ” and everything went to … well , to shit . “ Tuesday we had a president that I was proud to golf with , call my friend , who understood immigration had to be bipartisan , ” Graham said at a Senate hearing the next week . “ I don ’ t know where that guy went . I want him back . ”
He never came back . A week after that , White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley went on TV to denounce Graham as “ completely dishonest , ” insisting that he ’ d lied to the president about what a bipartisan DACA deal entailed , and concluding , “ To pretend [ Graham ] is anything other than someone who wants open borders and amnesty is just disingenuous . ”
In February , an anonymous White House official organized a press call with reporters to attack Graham , leading Graham to say resignedly ( and implying a suspicion as to who that official was ) , “ Stephen Miller is an outlier on immigration , he ’ s an extremist and the president who has turned the keys of the car over to him will never get anywhere . ”
But Graham ’ s outreach effort wasn ’ t a complete , clear failure until all bipartisan efforts on DACA failed in the Senate . It was the final nail in the coffin of a strategy he ’ s been crafting for months , one that relied on flattery and sycophancy to earn Trump ’ s good graces to maximize the odds of a reasonable immigration deal . That strategy has gone up in flames , and Graham ’ s reputation , and power on the Hill , has taken a huge plunge .","This week, the US Senate embarked on a strange, rarely seen approach to policymaking.

In November, Graham refused to vote for Trump, casting a ballot for independent conservative Evan McMullin instead.

But once Trump was in office, Graham took a different tone. He even sent out tweets about how much fun he had golfing with Trump, what a good golfer Trump is, and how great Trump’s golf courses are:

Just to be clear:



President @RealDonaldTrump INHERITED the mess with North Korea.



He did not create it. (1) — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) August 11, 2017

Really enjoyed a round of golf with President @realDonaldTrump today.



President Trump shot a 73 in windy and wet conditions! — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 9, 2017

Trump International Golf Club is a spectacular golf course.



Great day of fun playing with @POTUS @realDonaldTrump. https://t.co/92Xjk8d8B2 — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) December 10, 2017

At one point in November, Graham lambasted critics who tried to “label the guy some kind of kook not fit to be president,” despite the fact that he himself had called Trump a kook who was not fit to be president. More substantively, he referred Christopher Steele, the author of the infamous Trump-Russia dossier leaked by BuzzFeed in January 2017, to the Justice Department for criminal investigation, a meaningful act of loyalty to the president and sign he’ll look the other way at any possible untoward ties with Russia.

It was never super clear why Graham was suddenly sucking up to Trump. But it became clearer at an televised immigration conference in January.

At the meeting, on camera, Graham urged Trump to support a pathway to citizenship for DACA recipients, citing polls showing that Trump’s voters supported the move, noting that it would be tough and would face right-wing radio opposition but that Trump could help them finally pass something. “You have created an opportunity here, Mr. President, and you need to close the deal,” he said.

Then a couple of days later, Trump decided to call African nations “shitholes” and everything went to … well, to shit. “Tuesday we had a president that I was proud to golf with, call my friend, who understood immigration had to be bipartisan,” Graham said at a Senate hearing the next week. “I don’t know where that guy went. I want him back.”

He never came back. A week after that, White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley went on TV to denounce Graham as “completely dishonest,” insisting that he’d lied to the president about what a bipartisan DACA deal entailed, and concluding, “To pretend [Graham] is anything other than someone who wants open borders and amnesty is just disingenuous.”

In February, an anonymous White House official organized a press call with reporters to attack Graham, leading Graham to say resignedly (and implying a suspicion as to who that official was), “Stephen Miller is an outlier on immigration, he’s an extremist and the president who has turned the keys of the car over to him will never get anywhere.”

But Graham’s outreach effort wasn’t a complete, clear failure until all bipartisan efforts on DACA failed in the Senate. It was the final nail in the coffin of a strategy he’s been crafting for months, one that relied on flattery and sycophancy to earn Trump’s good graces to maximize the odds of a reasonable immigration deal. That strategy has gone up in flames, and Graham’s reputation, and power on the Hill, has taken a huge plunge.",www.vox.com,left,jsOcUkKSPKcafmkK

They’re just voting for Obamacare repeal.,2017-09-21,"Dylan Scott, Jen Kirby, Ezra Klein, Alissa Wilkinson, Sigal Samuel, Terry Nguyen, Rebecca Jennings","Senate Republicans are once again just a few votes away from repealing and replacing Obamacare . It ’ s a plan that senators themselves struggle to explain and defend and that emerged on the public stage mere days before an expected vote .
How have they found themselves here again , after their previous repeal bills failed in July ? The underlying truth , the beating heart of Obamacare repeal that refuses to let it die , is : Republicans just want to pass a bill , any bill , to say they repealed Obamacare . Whatever standards they ’ ve set for their health care plan , whatever promises they made before , don ’ t matter .
The policy is , in a very real sense , beside the point . Republican senators will tell you that themselves , in their own way .
“ If we bring this up on the floor , I think every Republican senator is in play because every Republican senator will be faced with that binary choice , ” Sen. Ron Johnson ( R-WI ) , one of the bill ’ s co-sponsors , told reporters . “ Okay , maybe this isn ’ t everything they want , but the binary choice is : 100 percent guarantee that Obamacare remains in place , and we may have a path to single-payer , versus this choice of federalism , where we start putting the states back in charge . ”
This bill , authored by Sens . Lindsey Graham ( R-SC ) and Bill Cassidy ( R-LA ) , keeps most of Obamacare ’ s taxes ( once a deal breaker for many Republicans ) , turns the revenue into a block grant , and sends the money down to the states with very few strings attached .
The block grant looks like nothing from any bill Republicans considered in late July . Several provisions cross what used to be red lines for Republican senators . Graham-Cassidy cuts Medicaid deeply by overhauling the program ’ s financing and ending the Medicaid expansion . It would allow health insurers to once again charge people higher premiums based on their medical history .
The bill should be untenable for other reasons : Graham-Cassidy promises steep spending cuts to most states , including those represented by Republican senators . It institutes a timeline — states would need to create brand new health care programs by 2020 — that most experts find unreasonable .
Yet Senate Republicans could be just a few votes away from passing it . There is only one red line the GOP is really afraid to cross : failing to repeal Obamacare .
“ Apparently no one cares what the bill actually does . That ’ s a tough thing to say , but it is more true than not , ” one Republican lobbyist told me . “ There are so many senators whose public positions in June leave them absolutely no conceivable way of voting for this . ”
If you transport yourself back to the summer , there were two issues on which a critical mass of Republican senators were unwilling to bend : They refused to back deep cuts to Medicaid , at least not without a softer landing and a viable alternative for covering the program ’ s current beneficiaries than the GOP ’ s bills provided ; and they would not roll back Obamacare ’ s protections for people with preexisting conditions .
Graham-Cassidy , when you cut through the spin , would do both .
The bill ends Obamacare ’ s Medicaid expansion in 2020 , with no “ glide path ” that Republican senators like Ohio ’ s Rob Portman and West Virginia ’ s Shelley Moore Capito previously demanded . It ends the expanded eligibility for Medicaid that Obamacare created , and even if states tried to reconstruct Medicaid expansion on their own with the bill ’ s block grant , there almost certainly would not be enough money without an impractical infusion of state dollars .
On top of that , the bill fundamentally overhauls Medicaid by placing a federal spending cap on the program . The Medicaid spending caps alone would cut the program ’ s spending by $ 120 billion , versus current law , by 2026 , according to Avalere Health , an independent consulting firm .
For much of the debate , those Medicaid cuts and the end of Medicaid expansion were a nonstarter for many Republicans . That ’ s what Sen. Dean Heller ( R-NV ) said earlier this year , as he stood besides Nevada Gov . Brian Sandoval and said he couldn ’ t support a bill that Sandoval opposed .
“ This is all about Medicaid expansion , ” Heller said , adding : “ It ’ s going to be very difficult to get me to a yes . ”
He is now a co-sponsor of Graham-Cassidy , even though Sandoval opposes it .
Sen. Lisa Murkowski ( R-AK ) , one of the most closely watched swing votes yet to take a public position on Graham-Cassidy , suggested to me in June that she couldn ’ t support any bill that ended Medicaid expansion .
“ I want greater access and lower costs , ” she told me then . “ For instance , if you are going to eliminate Medicaid expansion or even if you 're going to wind down Medicaid expansion , that 's not increasing access . ”
As for preexisting conditions , Graham-Cassidy falls short of Republican promises on that issue as well . If states choose to allow it , insurers could once again charge people higher premiums based on their medical history , a practice Obamacare had outlawed .
Cassidy has sought to defend the provision . “ The protection is the same , ” he told CNN this week .
His justification is that the bill requires states , if they seek a waiver from the Obamacare regulation , to describe how they would maintain “ adequate and affordable ” coverage for people adversely affected by the change .
The problem is , as ███ ’ s Sarah Kliff already documented , that the bill isn ’ t really specific about what those standards actually mean . So it does introduce a degree of uncertainty around how well people with preexisting conditions are protected that the current health care law does not .
`` You could stretch the definition pretty broadly of what counts , '' Chris Sloan , who has reviewed Graham-Cassidy for Avalere , told Kliff . `` Maybe you fund a high-risk pool that only allows in some number of people , and that counts . It 's a pretty wide space . ''
Here , again , Republican senators had long pledged they wouldn ’ t touch the protections for preexisting conditions .
“ We 're not going to do anything to change the current law when it comes to pre-existing conditions , I know which was a big concern with the House bill , ” Sen. John Cornyn , the No . 2 Republican , said this summer , per the Hill .
That position was supposed to be prevalent throughout the Republican conference .
`` I think people understand that 's got to be protected , and people understand what happened when the House dealt with it and opened it up , and it 's just not something that senators are wishing to do , ” Sen. Bob Corker ( R-TN ) said a few months ago .
Axios ’ s Sam Baker flagged some other provisions — notably , additional funding to address the opioid crisis — that senators had previously conditioned their support on but aren ’ t included in Graham-Cassidy .
Lastly , there were the process complaints . No Senate health care bill has gone through the regular order of committee hearings , expert testimony , or markups . The Finance Committee hastily scheduled a hearing for next week , but it was a naked attempt to assuage those concerns from a few key senators rather than an earnest start to the normal legislative process .
The most prominent critic of the process , Sen. John McCain ( R-AZ ) , who has urged Republicans to return to regular order since he helped sink Obamacare repeal in July , seemed to see through the gambit .

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said it will be unlikely to provide estimates on how many people would have health coverage under the bill or what would happen to premiums , because of the tight timeline . Johnson , who was at one time fixated on having enough information to determine his vote , dismissed the CBO analysis as “ a detail . ”
Nevertheless , despite all those broken promises , Senate Republicans are pushing ahead and might be within just a few votes of passing an Obamacare repeal bill .
It doesn ’ t matter which bill it is . I asked an aide to one Republican senator this week whether senators actually liked Graham-Cassidy or whether it was simply the last train leaving the Obamacare repeal station .
Republicans will be remarkably transparent about this , if you ask them .
“ This is not the best possible bill — this is the best bill possible under the circumstances , ” Sen.

“ You know , I could maybe give you 10 reasons why this bill shouldn ’ t be considered , ” he told local reporters this week . “ But Republicans campaigned on this so often that you have a responsibility to carry out what you said in the campaign . That ’ s pretty much as much of a reason as the substance of the bill . ”
So when you cut through the salesmanship around state flexibility and the evils of Obamacare , Senate Republicans will tell you right to your face why Graham-Cassidy , a bill nobody had taken seriously until a week ago , might very well pass the chamber in the next few days . They promised to repeal Obamacare , and this is the only Obamacare repeal bill left .
Such an abdication of any coherent policy vision has other Republicans in Washington , particularly those well studied in health policy , baffled .
“ I think this process with Graham-Cassidy is an embarrassment on top of the previous embarrassments — the cherry on top , if you will , ” a second GOP health care lobbyist told me . “ A sweeping revision of federal-state roles in and funding arrangements for health care , with one hearing , no markups , no CBO score .

Cory Booker , D-N.J. , is facing an ethics committee investigation for releasing confidential documents during the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh last week .
Speaking exclusively to `` Fox News Sunday , '' Sen. Chris Coons , D-Del. , who also serves on the Senate Ethics Committee , repeatedly refused to confirm or deny the existence of a formal probe into Booker 's actions .
`` I have to be careful what I say here , because I 'm the vice chairman of the Ethics Committee , and in that role I ca n't comment on anything that may or may not come before the committee , '' Coons said . He added : `` I really ca n't comment on whether or not this is breaking the rules of the committee . ''
When pressed by Wallace on whether Booker was facing an ethics probe , Coons stayed mum .
`` I ca n't comment on that , '' the Delaware senator said . `` The rules of the ethics committee prohibit any member of the committee from commenting on whether a matter is before the committee or not . '' Coons then confirmed that meant he could not deny the existence of a probe .
In a dramatic moment on Thursday morning , Booker announced that he would release a series of Bush-era documents , which included Kavanaugh 's thoughts on racial profiling in the wake of the September 11 terror attacks and his assessment of the Supreme Court 's views on Roe v. Wade .
ANALYSIS : CORY BOOKER TRIES BUT FAILS TO VIOLATE SENATE RULES IN COMEDY OF ERRORS
The documents appeared to be labeled `` committee confidential , '' meaning they were cleared to be viewed only by the Senate Judiciary Committee , not the public .
“ This is about the closest I 'll probably ever have in my life to an ‘ I am Spartacus ’ moment , ” Booker said , making sure to emphasize that he felt he was risking expulsion from the Senate for what he claimed were serious rules violations . Senators can only be expelled by a highly extraordinary two-thirds vote of their colleagues , which has not occured since the Civil War .
GRASSLEY UNLOADS ON BOOKER : 'CAN I ASK HOW LONG YOU 'RE GOING TO SAY THE SAME THING ? '
A Judiciary Committee spokesperson told Fox News late Thursday that at least some of the emails Booker had released were still `` committee confidential '' when he published them hours earlier , suggesting Booker had , in fact , violated Senate rules , although Republicans confirmed earlier in the day that they had cleared many of the documents for public release the night before Booker posted them on Twitter .
One of the documents was a 2003 email that had been marked `` committee confidential '' in which Kavanaugh wrote : `` I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent , and three current Justices on the Court would do so . ''
Kavanaugh , then a lawyer in the George W. Bush administration , was being asked for his opinion on a draft Op-Ed to be bylined by pro-life women . He repeatedly told Democrats that the email reflected only his opinion on the views of `` legal scholars , '' and were not necessarily a fair reflection of his own opinions .
Democrats also highlighted a 2001 email referenced on Wednesday in which Kavanaugh seemed dismissive of Department of Transportation regulations that gave preference to minority-owned companies , even where they did not offer the most competitive bid on a particular contract .
`` The fundamental problem in this case is that these DOT regulations use a lot of legalisms and disguises to mask what in reality is a naked racial set-aside , '' Kavanaugh wrote , as part of his analysis that conservative members of the Supreme Court would “ realize as much in short order and rule accordingly. ” Kavanaugh on Thursday defended the email as an assessment of his views on the Supreme Court 's probable take on the matter .
And in 2002 , Kavanaugh wrote that he `` generally '' favored racially neutral security measures in the long term . But he acknowledged that administration officials would need to `` grapple '' with the viability of a potential interim solution that included race as a consideration , suggesting that until race-neutral policies could be effectively implemented , national security concerns in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks could demand another approach .
Coons told Wallace that he remained `` gravely concerned that [ Kavanaugh ] is not inside the judicial mainstream on several really important precedents that would have a real impact on individual rights and liberties of Americans and on presidential power . ''
But the top Democrat agreed with the Trump administration on one thing : that the anonymous author of a New York Times Op-Ed describing efforts to undermine his presidency from within should leave the White House .
`` I agree with that position ; I think the honorable thing to do is to resign and to go public with the author 's concerns about the president ’ s fitness to serve , '' Coons said .","A top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee on Sunday refused to rule out the possibility that Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., is facing an ethics committee investigation for releasing confidential documents during the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh last week.

Speaking exclusively to ""Fox News Sunday,"" Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., who also serves on the Senate Ethics Committee, repeatedly refused to confirm or deny the existence of a formal probe into Booker's actions.

""I have to be careful what I say here, because I'm the vice chairman of the Ethics Committee, and in that role I can't comment on anything that may or may not come before the committee,"" Coons said. He added: ""I really can't comment on whether or not this is breaking the rules of the committee.""

When pressed by Wallace on whether Booker was facing an ethics probe, Coons stayed mum.

""I can't comment on that,"" the Delaware senator said. ""The rules of the ethics committee prohibit any member of the committee from commenting on whether a matter is before the committee or not."" Coons then confirmed that meant he could not deny the existence of a probe.

In a dramatic moment on Thursday morning, Booker announced that he would release a series of Bush-era documents, which included Kavanaugh's thoughts on racial profiling in the wake of the September 11 terror attacks and his assessment of the Supreme Court's views on Roe v. Wade.

ANALYSIS: CORY BOOKER TRIES BUT FAILS TO VIOLATE SENATE RULES IN COMEDY OF ERRORS

The documents appeared to be labeled ""committee confidential,"" meaning they were cleared to be viewed only by the Senate Judiciary Committee, not the public.

“This is about the closest I'll probably ever have in my life to an ‘I am Spartacus’ moment,” Booker said, making sure to emphasize that he felt he was risking expulsion from the Senate for what he claimed were serious rules violations. Senators can only be expelled by a highly extraordinary two-thirds vote of their colleagues, which has not occured since the Civil War.

GRASSLEY UNLOADS ON BOOKER: 'CAN I ASK HOW LONG YOU'RE GOING TO SAY THE SAME THING?'

A Judiciary Committee spokesperson told Fox News late Thursday that at least some of the emails Booker had released were still ""committee confidential"" when he published them hours earlier, suggesting Booker had, in fact, violated Senate rules, although Republicans confirmed earlier in the day that they had cleared many of the documents for public release the night before Booker posted them on Twitter.

One of the documents was a 2003 email that had been marked ""committee confidential"" in which Kavanaugh wrote: ""I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current Justices on the Court would do so.""

Kavanaugh, then a lawyer in the George W. Bush administration, was being asked for his opinion on a draft Op-Ed to be bylined by pro-life women. He repeatedly told Democrats that the email reflected only his opinion on the views of ""legal scholars,"" and were not necessarily a fair reflection of his own opinions.

Democrats also highlighted a 2001 email referenced on Wednesday in which Kavanaugh seemed dismissive of Department of Transportation regulations that gave preference to minority-owned companies, even where they did not offer the most competitive bid on a particular contract.

""The fundamental problem in this case is that these DOT regulations use a lot of legalisms and disguises to mask what in reality is a naked racial set-aside,"" Kavanaugh wrote, as part of his analysis that conservative members of the Supreme Court would “realize as much in short order and rule accordingly.” Kavanaugh on Thursday defended the email as an assessment of his views on the Supreme Court's probable take on the matter.

And in 2002, Kavanaugh wrote that he ""generally"" favored racially neutral security measures in the long term. But he acknowledged that administration officials would need to ""grapple"" with the viability of a potential interim solution that included race as a consideration, suggesting that until race-neutral policies could be effectively implemented, national security concerns in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks could demand another approach.

Coons told Wallace that he remained ""gravely concerned that [Kavanaugh] is not inside the judicial mainstream on several really important precedents that would have a real impact on individual rights and liberties of Americans and on presidential power.""

But the top Democrat agreed with the Trump administration on one thing: that the anonymous author of a New York Times Op-Ed describing efforts to undermine his presidency from within should leave the White House.

The Senate on Wednesday narrowly advanced an emergency funding measure to respond to the influx of unaccompanied migrant children crossing the southern border that has triggered a humanitarian crisis.

And that wasn’t even the hard part.

Despite the 63-33 vote, the $2.7 billion measure still faces significant barriers before it can win final passage in the Senate — let alone be reconciled with a drastically different bill that is emerging in the GOP-led House.

""The House is going to be a pretty tough road to win back this cycle. The presidential race, it's kind of like who really knows at this point. But the Senate is a safer bet,” the national GOP strategist said, adding it could ""easily be a possibility"" that Democrats win the White House and Republicans hold onto the Senate.

Republicans say they are cautiously optimistic about their chances for keeping the Senate, but they aren’t taking any chances.

GOP Senate candidates have raised more than $80 million so far this election cycle, compared to more than $61 million for Democratic candidates, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Additionally, the National Republican Senatorial Committee has outspent and outraised its Democratic counterpart, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC), this cycle. A DSCC spokesperson noted Tuesday that the Democratic campaign arm outraised its GOP counterpart in July and has more cash on hand — roughly $16.9 million, compared to $11.7 million for Republicans.

“Donors are no different than when some of us go to Vegas for a long weekend,” one Republican consultant said. “They want to bet on the winner. No one is going to invest in something they don’t think is going to win.”

While there’s a growing sense among Republicans that the Senate may be their best hope of holding on to a lever of power in Washington, some Republican incumbents are already seen as being on the chopping block. One GOP operative who has worked on Senate races predicted that Gardner, perhaps the most at-risk GOP incumbent, would lose his seat, saying his fate was all but decided.

“Cory is a great guy and a great candidate, but he’s f---ed,” one GOP operative who has worked on Senate races said. “RIP Cory Gardner.”

In turn, the operative said, Republicans would be forced to pour hundreds of millions of dollars into defending other vulnerable senators, notably McSally and Collins, who have already drawn high-profile Democratic challengers.

“If it’s a tight presidential, it’s really going to boil down to this: What amount of money would you not spend [to hold the Senate]?” the operative said.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's move Thursday to make possible the confirmation of presidential nominees with a simple majority marks a tectonic shift in the rules and folkways of the Senate.

Back in 2005, then-Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist called this idea ""the constitutional option"" when he came close to invoking it on behalf of the judicial nominees of President George W. Bush.

That sounded a lot more dignified than the name Frist's predecessor, Trent Lott, had used just two years earlier: ""the nuclear option.""

Guess which name stuck. The latter label was not only shorter for headline writers, it also had the crack of doom, invoking the ultimate form of warfare.

By either name, it was the same maneuver, and Lott and Frist were threatening to use it for the same reason. Restive Democrats, then in the Senate minority, were holding up Bush nominees they didn't like by invoking every senator's right to ""extended debate.""

That legal nicety has a more familiar name, too: filibuster.

Nowadays, senators rarely take the floor for extended speeches intended to talk a particular bill or nomination to death. They merely threaten to do so. (Freshman Rand Paul of Kentucky did mount a ""live filibuster"" earlier this year, achieving little but gaining a lot of media attention.)

But even the threat can be — and usually is — as effective as an actual filibuster. It takes 60 votes to squelch such a threat, and when the majority party has just 55 votes, that higher total is a tall order indeed.

That's just the number Frist had in 2005, when he seemed on the verge of changing the Senate rules to permit the confirmation of federal judges with a simple majority. All it would take, he said, was for the presiding officer of the Senate (always a member of the majority party) to rule in favor of changing the rules to confirm on simple majority. If a simple majority voted to uphold that change, it would take effect.

This was far from a new idea in Lott and Frist's era. Vice President Richard Nixon had been tasked with writing a legal brief on behalf of the idea back in the 1950s, when minority Democrats were bedeviling some of President Dwight Eisenhower's judicial choices.

It didn't happen then, and it didn't happen half a century later. So why is it happening now?

First off, it didn't happen in 2005 because a group of relatively centrist senators got together to prevent it from happening. Seven Republicans and seven Democrats formed what was called the Gang of 14, saying they would oppose the use of the filibuster for any but the most egregiously offensive nominees to the federal bench. The crisis receded.

Since then, however, the use of the filibuster threat to stall judicial nominations (and other executive nominations) has been vastly expanded. On the floor today, Reid said there had been as many instances of filibuster against nominees in the past 4 1/2 years (i.e., the Obama presidency) as in all prior American history.

Indeed, the filibuster in our time has become as much a Senate routine as the chaplain's morning prayer.

Calling the majority vote confirmation back in 2005, Frist had made the point that the Constitution requires the Senate to ""advise and consent"" in presidential appointments but does not specify a supermajority to do so. This stands in contrast to many other constitutional mandates, such as the two-thirds majority for ratifying treaties or constitutional amendments.

Borrowing from that Nixon legal brief, Frist drew the conclusion that the framers had not seen the confirmation of judges and others in the same category with those weightier matters for which it required a wider margin of support.

Will the nuclear option trigger nuclear retaliation?

Back in 2005, Democrats told Frist they would shut down all Senate operations if he exercised the nuclear option. Thanks to the Gang of 14, that confrontation never took place.

Update 5:53 p.m. ET

Washington (CNN) - Senate Democrats dropped the filibuster bomb Thursday, and now the question is what kind of fallout will result from the so-called nuclear option.

By a 52-48 vote, the Senate ended the ability of minority Republicans to continue using filibusters to block some of President Barack Obama's judicial and executive nominations, despite the vehement objections of Republicans.



Majority Democrats then quickly acted on the change by ending a filibuster against one of Obama's nominees for a federal appeals court.

Obama later cited what he called ""an unprecedented pattern of obstruction in Congress"" during his presidency for the move led by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.

""A deliberate and determined effort to obstruct everything, no matter what the merits, just to refight the results of an election is not normal,"" Obama said of the change. ""And for the sake of future generations, it cannot become normal.""

The man who coined the term 'nuclear option' regrets ever pursuing it

Republicans warned the controversial move would worsen the already bitter partisan divide in Washington, complaining it took away a time-honored right for any member of the Senate minority party to filibuster.

""This changes everything, this changes everything,"" veteran GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona told reporters. He blamed newer Democratic senators who never served as the minority party for pushing the issue, adding: ""They succeeded and they will pay a very, very heavy price for it.""

Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky called Thursday's maneuvering a diversion from the problem-plagued Obamacare issue that has been giving the White House and Democrats political headaches.

""You'll regret this and you may regret it a lot sooner than you think,"" McConnell warned, adding that ""the Democratic playbook of broken promises, double standards and raw power - the same playbook that got us Obamacare - has to end. It may take the American people to end it, but it has to end.""

CNN chief political analyst Gloria Borger said Democrats seem to believe that things couldn't get much worse, with judicial vacancies increasing and Republicans increasing their use of filibusters after an agreement earlier this year that cleared some presidential appointees.

Opinion: 'Nuclear option' makes GOP do its job

""I think there is probably a little bit of 'calling your bluff' going on here; that Harry Reid basically threw up his hands and said, enough of this, it's time to do it,"" Borger said. Now, she added, the question was whether angry Republicans would further harden their positions in the already bitter political climate which she said ""will get worse.""

Thursday's change affected presidential executive nominations such as ambassadors and agency heads, along with judicial nominations except for Supreme Court appointees.

It did not affect the ability of Republicans to filibuster legislation.

Under the old rules, it took 60 votes to break a filibuster of presidential nominees. The change means a simple Senate majority of 51 now suffices in the chamber Democrats currently control with a 55-45 majority.

The nuclear option deployed by Reid allowed a procedural vote that required a simple majority to change the threshold for approving presidential and judicial nominees, instead of a super majority typically required.

Opinion: What's at stake in power struggle over judges

""It's time to get the Senate working again,"" the Nevada Democrat said on the Senate floor. ""Not for the good of the current Democratic majority or some future Republican majority, but for the good of the United States of America. It's time to change. It's time to change the Senate before this institution becomes obsolete.""

Reid followed through on threats dating back years after Republicans blocked three judicial nominees to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, known as the highest court in the land after the Supreme Court.

Both parties have been guilty of political hijinks involving filibusters.

In 2005, Republicans who then held the majority threatened the nuclear option to prevent Democratic filibusters of President George W. Bush's judicial nominees. The confrontation was averted thanks to an agreement by a bipartisan group of 14 senators.

Obama, then a senator, opposed the nuclear option at that time.

""I urge my Republican colleagues not to go through with changing these rules,"" he said on the Senate floor in 2005. ""In the long run it is not a good result for either party. One day Democrats will be in the majority again and this rule change will be no fairer to a Republican minority than it is to a Democratic minority.""

Explainer: What's the nuclear option?

Asked about Obama's past stance compared to his support Thursday for Reid's move, White House spokesman Josh Earnest cited increased obstruction of Obama nominees for the need to get the Senate working again.

""The circumstances have unfortunately changed for the worse since 2005,"" Earnest said, noting that there were 50 judicial vacancies when Obama took office compared to 93 today and that many of the President's nominees have bipartisan support but can't get an up-or-down Senate vote.

Furious Republicans accused Reid of reneging on a pledge against using the nuclear option.

""It is another partisan political maneuver to permit the Democratic majority to do whatever it wants to do, and in this case it is to advance the President's regulatory agenda and the only cure for it that I know is an election,"" said veteran GOP Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee.

Until now, Reid hadn't necessarily had support from enough of his own Democratic caucus to pass a rules change. Some Democratic senators were reluctant to change the rules because of reverence for the institution and, more importantly, because they know Democrats will not always be in the majority.

Veterans such as Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, who had been opposed to the nuclear option to change the Senate rules, recently decided to back Reid's move. Feinstein and others, like fellow Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, said things were so broken in Washington that the nuclear option was the only way to fix it.

Three Democrats voted with Republicans on Thursday in opposing the nuclear option - Sens. Carl Levin of Michigan, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Mark Pryor of Arkansas.

However, Republicans argued Democrats were just trying to manufacture a crisis in order to create a distraction from the Obamacare rollout debacle.

In a new era of Republican-led governance , there is little Democrats can do to prevent Donald Trump ’ s cabinet nominees from being confirmed . But that won ’ t stop them from trying .
Democratic senators are targeting eight of Trump ’ s cabinet nominees whom they view as particularly “ troublesome ” and are pushing for more time to hold hearings on each of them .
“ We have asked for fair hearings on all of those nominees , ” the minority leader , Chuck Schumer , told reporters on Wednesday . “ There are a lot of questions about these nominees . ”
The nominees flagged for extra scrutiny include Steven Mnuchin , a Goldman Sachs banker turned Hollywood movie financier with no government experience , as Treasury secretary ; Rex Tillerson , who headed the biggest oil company in the world , as secretary of state , and the nominee for attorney general , Jeff Sessions , an Alabama senator who has been accused of making racially insensitive comments , which derailed his nomination to be a federal judge under Ronald Reagan .
Democrats have little leverage to prevent Trump ’ s nominees from being confirmed but they can significantly delay the process . Trump ’ s cabinet nominees will need 51 votes in the Senate to be confirmed and Republicans hold 52 seats .
On Wednesday , several Senate Democrats held private meetings with Trump nominees and later shared their initial reactions . Though all declined to say whether they would support the nominee , they signalled what the points of contention might be in the upcoming hearings .
After a private meeting with Sessions on Wednesday , Dick Durbin , the second-highest ranking Senate Democrat , signalled that race and civil rights would be a key topic in his confirmation hearing next week .
“ Certainly there are elements in his background that raise questions , ” Durbin said after their meeting , referring to allegations that Sessions was racially insensitive . “ He said several times , point blank , that this was not an issue as far as he was concerned . ”
Beyond his past comments , Durbin said he was concerned by Sessions ’ views on voter ID laws and immigration . He also said he was dismayed that the Alabama Republican did not commit to following through on the recommendations outlined in a forthcoming report by the justice department ’ s civil rights division on the Chicago police department ’ s use of force .
Before the meeting ended , Durbin said he offered Sessions the book White Rage : The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide by Carol Anderson . “ I ’ m hoping he ’ ll take a look at it , ” he said .
Meanwhile , Tillerson met members of the foreign relations committee on Capitol Hill on Wednesday , one week before he is scheduled to testify before them .
Senator Chris Coons , a Democrat from Delaware , said he was “ generally encouraged ” by his conversation with Tillerson , although he said he wanted to hear more before deciding whether to support his nomination .
Several senators , including Republicans Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and John McCain of Arizona , have raised concerns about Tillerson ’ s posture towards Russia and its president , Vladimir Putin .
Coons took issue with the confirmation schedule , saying next week seemed too soon for members to hold a hearing on Tillerson , given Republicans ’ current plans to also vote on repealing Barack Obama ’ s healthcare law .
To rush the confirmation process “ strikes me as trying to get too many things done at the same time ” , he said , adding that he had been up all night preparing for his meeting with Tillerson .
The Democrats ’ list also includes Scott Pruitt , a climate change denier and prospective head of the Environmental Protection Agency , Tom Price , a prominent opponent of the Affordable Care Act , for secretary of health and human services , Andy Puzder , a fast food executive and critic of raising the minimum wage , as labor secretary , Congressman Mick Mulvaney , a fiscal conservative , as director of the Office of Management and Budget , and Betsy DeVos , a staunch supporter of school choice , Trump ’ s education secretary nominee .
After a meeting with DeVos on Wednesday , Senator Patty Murray , a Democrat from Washington , said in a statement that she continued to have “ serious concerns ” about DeVos ’ s “ long record of working to privatize and defund public education , expand taxpayer-funded private school vouchers , and block accountability for charter schools , including for-profit charter schools ” .
Confirmation hearings are scheduled to begin for Trump ’ s cabinet picks next week , with several already slated for 11 January . But before they get under way , Democrats are demanding at least two days of hearings for each cabinet nominee and have requested that they do not overlap so that members can “ spend a lot of time studying ” for them .
“ I would like to succeed in negotiating something where we get full and fair hearings – we ’ re not trying to be dilatory – and hear what these nominees have to say , ” Schumer said . “ There are so many issues about so many of them that to rush them through would be a disservice to the American people . ”
In response , Republicans are now accusing Democrats of obstructionism , an echo of the charge levied by Democrats against Republicans during the Obama years .
The majority leader , Mitch McConnell , of Kentucky , said he expected the Senate to be ready to confirm a number of Trump ’ s cabinet nominees shortly after Inauguration Day , on 20 January , adding that in 2009 the Senate approved seven of Barack Obama ’ s nominees .
“ I believe all the president-elect ’ s cabinet appointments will be confirmed , ” McConnell told reporters on Wednesday , speaking before Schumer . “ I think it would be great if the Democrats would understand that , particularly with regard to the national security team , the secretary of defense , CIA , homeland security , it would make a lot of sense to have those folks in place on day one and I hope we ’ re getting to the point where that will be possible . ”
Schumer scoffed at the notion of a precedent . “ Leader McConnell has talked about the fact that a lot of nominees were approved in President Obama ’ s first few days after he was inaugurated , but they all had their paperwork in early , their ethics reports , their 90-day plan to extricate themselves from conflicts , their FBI briefings , ” he said .
Absent from the list of nominees Democrats are targeting is Marine General James Mattis , Trump ’ s pick for defense secretary , who will need a congressional waiver to be confirmed .
After meeting privately with Mattis on Capitol Hill on Wednesday , Democratic senator Kirsten Gillibrand , of New York , said she still opposed a waiver of the law that requires that defense secretaries be removed from the military for at least seven years .
“ He has served our country admirably , ” Gillibrand told reporters after their meeting . “ He is well-regarded as an extraordinary general , and I am very grateful for that service , and I ’ m very grateful that he ’ s willing to continue his service for the president-elect . But I still believe that civilian control of our military is fundamental to the American democracy . ”
The Senate is also preparing for a pitched battle over Trump ’ s future choice to replace Antonin Scalia on the supreme court , which will require 60 votes .
“ Apparently , there ’ s yet a new standard which is to not confirm a supreme court nominee at all , ” McConnell said on Wednesday , referring to a remark Schumer made the previous evening on MSNBC that Democrats would “ absolutely ” keep the vacancy open if the nominee were outside the mainstream . “ I think that ’ s something the American people simply will not tolerate . ”
“ Let ’ s see who they nominate , ” Schumer told reporters . “ If they ’ re in the mainstream , we ’ ll give them a very careful look . If they ’ re out of the mainstream , we ’ ll oppose them tooth and nail . ”
Asked how he would define mainstream , Schumer replied : “ You know it when you see it . ”
Senate Republicans blocked Obama ’ s nomination of Merrick Garland to replace Scalia for more than nine months .","Democratic senators flag eight of president-elect’s picks and are pushing for more time for confirmation hearings

In a new era of Republican-led governance, there is little Democrats can do to prevent Donald Trump’s cabinet nominees from being confirmed. But that won’t stop them from trying.



Democratic senators are targeting eight of Trump’s cabinet nominees whom they view as particularly “troublesome” and are pushing for more time to hold hearings on each of them.

“We have asked for fair hearings on all of those nominees,” the minority leader, Chuck Schumer, told reporters on Wednesday. “There are a lot of questions about these nominees.”

The nominees flagged for extra scrutiny include Steven Mnuchin, a Goldman Sachs banker turned Hollywood movie financier with no government experience, as Treasury secretary; Rex Tillerson, who headed the biggest oil company in the world, as secretary of state, and the nominee for attorney general, Jeff Sessions, an Alabama senator who has been accused of making racially insensitive comments, which derailed his nomination to be a federal judge under Ronald Reagan.

Democrats have little leverage to prevent Trump’s nominees from being confirmed but they can significantly delay the process. Trump’s cabinet nominees will need 51 votes in the Senate to be confirmed and Republicans hold 52 seats.

On Wednesday, several Senate Democrats held private meetings with Trump nominees and later shared their initial reactions. Though all declined to say whether they would support the nominee, they signalled what the points of contention might be in the upcoming hearings.

Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, said he was “generally encouraged” by his conversation with Tillerson, although he said he wanted to hear more before deciding whether to support his nomination.

Several senators, including Republicans Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and John McCain of Arizona, have raised concerns about Tillerson’s posture towards Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin.

Coons took issue with the confirmation schedule, saying next week seemed too soon for members to hold a hearing on Tillerson, given Republicans’ current plans to also vote on repealing Barack Obama’s healthcare law.

To rush the confirmation process “strikes me as trying to get too many things done at the same time”, he said, adding that he had been up all night preparing for his meeting with Tillerson.

The Democrats’ list also includes Scott Pruitt, a climate change denier and prospective head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Tom Price, a prominent opponent of the Affordable Care Act, for secretary of health and human services, Andy Puzder, a fast food executive and critic of raising the minimum wage, as labor secretary, Congressman Mick Mulvaney, a fiscal conservative, as director of the Office of Management and Budget, and Betsy DeVos, a staunch supporter of school choice, Trump’s education secretary nominee.

After a meeting with DeVos on Wednesday, Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington, said in a statement that she continued to have “serious concerns” about DeVos’s “long record of working to privatize and defund public education, expand taxpayer-funded private school vouchers, and block accountability for charter schools, including for-profit charter schools”.

Confirmation hearings are scheduled to begin for Trump’s cabinet picks next week, with several already slated for 11 January. But before they get under way, Democrats are demanding at least two days of hearings for each cabinet nominee and have requested that they do not overlap so that members can “spend a lot of time studying” for them.

“I would like to succeed in negotiating something where we get full and fair hearings – we’re not trying to be dilatory – and hear what these nominees have to say,” Schumer said. “There are so many issues about so many of them that to rush them through would be a disservice to the American people.”

In response, Republicans are now accusing Democrats of obstructionism, an echo of the charge levied by Democrats against Republicans during the Obama years.

The majority leader, Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, said he expected the Senate to be ready to confirm a number of Trump’s cabinet nominees shortly after Inauguration Day, on 20 January, adding that in 2009 the Senate approved seven of Barack Obama’s nominees.

“I believe all the president-elect’s cabinet appointments will be confirmed,” McConnell told reporters on Wednesday, speaking before Schumer. “I think it would be great if the Democrats would understand that, particularly with regard to the national security team, the secretary of defense, CIA, homeland security, it would make a lot of sense to have those folks in place on day one and I hope we’re getting to the point where that will be possible.”

Schumer scoffed at the notion of a precedent. “Leader McConnell has talked about the fact that a lot of nominees were approved in President Obama’s first few days after he was inaugurated, but they all had their paperwork in early, their ethics reports, their 90-day plan to extricate themselves from conflicts, their FBI briefings,” he said.

Absent from the list of nominees Democrats are targeting is Marine General James Mattis, Trump’s pick for defense secretary, who will need a congressional waiver to be confirmed.

After meeting privately with Mattis on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, Democratic senator Kirsten Gillibrand, of New York, said she still opposed a waiver of the law that requires that defense secretaries be removed from the military for at least seven years.

“He has served our country admirably,” Gillibrand told reporters after their meeting. “He is well-regarded as an extraordinary general, and I am very grateful for that service, and I’m very grateful that he’s willing to continue his service for the president-elect. But I still believe that civilian control of our military is fundamental to the American democracy.”

The Senate is also preparing for a pitched battle over Trump’s future choice to replace Antonin Scalia on the supreme court, which will require 60 votes.

“Apparently, there’s yet a new standard which is to not confirm a supreme court nominee at all,” McConnell said on Wednesday, referring to a remark Schumer made the previous evening on MSNBC that Democrats would “absolutely” keep the vacancy open if the nominee were outside the mainstream. “I think that’s something the American people simply will not tolerate.”

On Wednesday, Schumer moderated his comments.

“Let’s see who they nominate,” Schumer told reporters. “If they’re in the mainstream, we’ll give them a very careful look. If they’re out of the mainstream, we’ll oppose them tooth and nail.”

Asked how he would define mainstream, Schumer replied: “You know it when you see it.”

Fast forward to early this month, when the annual event took place again at the same posh Palm Beach resort. Far from preaching caution, many of the 400 donors in attendance openly mused about what a Republican Senate would bring, and Collins was the one trying to keep expectations in check.

After 15 months in the doldrums, Republicans feel like they’re finally getting their mojo back.

Emboldened by the president’s weak poll numbers, the botched Obamacare rollout and a still-sputtering economy, GOP donors and operatives are increasingly bullish about their prospects in the midterm election — most of all capturing the Senate. Seats that a year ago looked like sure bets for Democrats now have the makings of real races — in states such as Michigan, Virginia, and, if former Republican Sen. Scott Brown runs, New Hampshire.

Worries last fall that the party would pay a heavy price at the ballot box for forcing the government to shut down have faded as quickly as attention has shifted to frustration with the health care law.

No one is saying that the party has solved its underlying problems — deep distrust between the establishment and tea party wings, and the disconnect with young and minority voters that was on display in 2012. And Republicans were similarly optimistic in 2010 and 2012 about retaking the Senate until poor candidates blew winnable races.

But there’s a palpable sense of optimism that 2014 will be the GOP’s year.

“People like to hang out with winners, and it feels right now as though Republicans — unlike the early part of last year — have found their sea legs and have a bit of wind at their back,” said New York investment banker and major GOP donor Jeffrey Berenson.

After getting outraised by $16 million last year, the NRSC announced recently that it collected just slightly more money than its Democratic counterpart in December. Leaders of the major conservative outside groups say that skittish donors have started to open their checkbooks with the new year after a lackluster fundraising haul in 2013.

And in a huge boon for the Republican effort, Americans for Prosperity, the group funded by the billionaire Koch brothers, has spent tens of millions of dollars already targeting vulnerable Democratic incumbents on Obamacare. That’s an unusually high level of engagement so long before Election Day.

Even with the improved environment this year, the party’s chances are still roughly 50-50, according to several election handicappers. And there is concern that contentious primaries — in states such as Georgia, Iowa, Alaska and North Carolina — will again yield nominees who can’t win a general election.

“While the mood has changed, we still have significant work to bring that about,” said NRSC Chairman Jerry Moran, a senator from Kansas.

McConnell is fine with talking to Obama — just talking at this point — but he doesn’t want Reid there when it happens.

Such is life in Congress, where hope of bipartisanship is giving way to the same old toxic relations.

From the outside, the Senate appeared to have the bipartisan thing down this spring: so called “gangs” of senators have hashed out agreements on guns and immigration. President Barack Obama has had two dinners with Senate Republicans and traveled up to the Hill to meet with lawmakers from both chambers.

But the good feelings have really been only in the Senate, and only among a minority of Republicans to boot. Bad blood remains between party leaders and the national partisan realities haven’t changed.

And while the leaders don’t get along, relationships among the other 98 senators will be tested when voting begins on the controversial gun and immigration measures — starting with this week’s expected vote on expanding background checks for firearms purchases. McConnell plans to pull out all the stops to block the bill, and GOP senators are blasting any immigration plan that they say smells of “amnesty.”

That’s just the Senate. House Republicans, their own seats made even safer by redistricting, are in no hurry bring up immigration, gun control or revenue issues or cave in to Obama or Democrats.

In May, House Republicans will hold what they are dubbing a “special conference” to plan for the summer’s policy fights with Democrats, similar to their January meeting in Williamsburg, Va., in which they successfully recalibrated early year budget fights, according to GOP leadership aides.

“I don’t see this as a wave and there’s something in the water that has us changed,” said Rep. James Lankford of Oklahoma, chairman of the House Republican Policy Committee.

Democratic Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland seemed to agree.

“On the House side, unfortunately you got a very knee-jerk ideologically rigid caucus for the most part,” said Van Hollen, the top Democrat on the Budget Committee. “The most active part of the House Republican Caucus is the tea party movement. They still dominate the discussion.”

The GOP’s meeting in May is likely to center around the debt ceiling, which could be another high-stakes summer showdown with Obama. House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and the leadership are likely to present a few scenarios to the conference and see which one sticks.

How that works out may depend on what — if anything — House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and his Senate counterpart Patty Murray (D-Wash.) do on a budget conference committee that addresses entitlements, debts and taxes. Both the House and Senate passed budget resolutions, but the two sides remain far apart on spending, taxes and reforming entitlement programs.

Rand Paul : Obama is trying to ‘ scare people ’ on debt ceiling","6 years ago

Updated 10:32 a.m. ET, 10/14/2013

(CNN) – The Senate is 70% to 80% close to a deal to raise the debt ceiling and end the government shutdown, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, said Monday on CNN's ""New Day.""

""I think we're 70%-80% there, putting the extra 20-25% to it,"" he told CNN's Chris Cuomo. ""When should the (continuing resolution) come due, when should the debt ceiling come due, and does that give that time for the budget conference, the budget committees to sit down and work through this? Those are the details that have to be worked out.""

Manchin and Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine over the weekend led a bipartisan group of 10 other senators to draft a plan that would end the ongoing stalemate in Washington. He said they have a ""good template,"" and he believes both Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell are looking at the plan.

""We're making progress. We're gonna continue to meet throughout the day. And the conversations have been very constructive,"" Collins told reporters on Capitol Hill Monday morning. ""We're not gonna release any details until we have an agreement. I hope we will have an agreement. We're making progress toward an agreement, but we're not there yet.""

Talking seen as 'breakthrough' on Capitol Hill

Reid, however, rejected the plan on Saturday, saying it's ""not going to go anyplace at this stage.""

""There are two good things in it, ""Reid said Saturday in a press conference. ""Number one, it opens the government. Number two, it extends the debt ceiling. Other than that there's little agreement with us.""

The Senate voted on a separate procedural measure to extend the debt limit with no strings attached on Saturday, but the measure fell short of the 60 votes needed to proceed.

No deal in sight as shutdown approaches third week

Collins said Sunday she ""was very surprised"" when she heard Reid make his decision about the bipartisan proposal.

""I was very surprised when Senator Reid said that, I don't know why he said it. I don't think it was very constructive,"" Collins said on CNN's ""State of the Union with Candy Crowley."" ""But the fact is we have a responsibility to govern and we're continuing to talk and I'm still hopeful that at least we sparked a dialogue that did not exist before we put out a plan.""

So what exactly was in their plan?

The framework called for a longer extension of the debt limit and government funding, as well as a two-year delay on the 2.3% tax on medical devices, which is used to help pay for the new federal health care law. The plan would also give federal agencies greater flexibility to deal with the forced spending cuts known as sequestration.

Manchin further explained Monday the deal would include verification measures to prevent people from ""scamming or frauding"" the health care insurance system. According the agreement, the Senate and the House would go to conference to reconcile their differences and work out a long-term budget deal. The deadline for the budget conference, however, is one of the details in the plan that hasn't been worked out.

The Treasury Department says it will be unable to pay the government's bills unless the debt limit is increased by Thursday. The partial shutdown of government services has been in effect since October 1.

But a key sticking point for Democrats is sequestration. While the Collins' plan give ""flexibility"" on the spending cuts, Democrats and the White House don't want to agree to anything that allows another round of the spending limits to kick in as they're supposed to in mid-January, senior Democratic sources told CNN's Dana Bash.

McConnell, who faces a tea party primary challenge in his 2014 re-election bid, is pushing back hard against the Democrats' insistence to get rid of the currently scheduled spending cuts.

Republican Sen. Bob Corker, who's been working closely with Manchin and Collins on the deal, said he has reason to believe the Senate will come to an agreement Monday.

""I know Mitch and Harry are talking, and I think we're about to get to a place to move something hopefully off the Senate floor that's widely bipartisan,"" he told CNN.

While it may not ""attract the fringe on either side"" the agreement may allow lawmakers to ""pass something off the Senate floor,"" he added.

The Senate reconvened briefly Sunday afternoon but adjourned with no signs of progress on a deal. The Senate meets again Monday at 2 p.m. ET, while the House meets at noon.

Before leaving Capitol Hill on Sunday, Reid struck a positive note as he spoke on the Senate floor.

""I've had a productive conversation with the Republican leader this afternoon. Our discussions were substantive and we'll continue those discussions. I'm optimistic about the prospects for a positive conclusion,"" he said.

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – Facebook's discovery of a covert campaign to try to influence the November elections underscores that Russia and other foreign actors ""continue an aggressive and pervasive influence campaign against the United States,"" senior Republican Sen. Richard Burr said Wednesday.

Burr, the Senate Intelligence Committee chairman, said at a hearing that the threat to the nation is as serious as ""terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, espionage or regional instability.""

He said Russia and other foreign powers are ""using our own rights and freedoms to weaken our country from within.""

""Election influence from abroad represents an intolerable assault on the democratic foundation this republic was built on,"" Burr said.

Facebook announced Tuesday that it had detected a covert campaign to try to influence the Nov. 6 congressional elections by targeting divisive social issues such as race and immigration.

The social media company discovered 32 fake pages and accounts, created between March 2017 and May 2018. While Facebook officials could not definitively tie the fake accounts to Russia, intelligence agencies have been warning that the Kremlin will try to interfere in this year's election, just as it did in the 2016 presidential race.

The Senate Intelligence Committee has invited executives from Facebook, Twitter and Google to a hearing scheduled for Sept. 5.

The Senate panel, unlike its House counterpart, has agreed in a strong, bipartisan way with the 2017 assessment by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the 2016 election and that the Kremlin was trying to help boost Donald Trump's candidacy while hurting Hillary Clinton.

Vice Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., said Congress needs to go beyond hearings and take legislative action.

""I think we need to start pushing ourselves beyond just recognizing the problem and start to push actual policy ideas forward,"" Warner said.

The bill that appears to be gaining the most momentum is the Secure Elections Act, a bipartisan bill by Sens. James Lankford, R-Okla., and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., that would strengthen information-sharing between federal and state officials to thwart Russian hackers trying to breach election systems. Senate Rules Committee Chairman Roy Blunt, R-Mo., said Tuesday that the panel will vote on the bill later this month.

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said Wednesday that what's happening on Facebook and other social media platforms is ""nothing less than informational warfare"" by Russian President Vladimir Putin against America.

Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake unburdened himself and burdened the rest of us Tuesday with what may rank as one of the worst-delivered nationally televised speeches in the history of the U.S. Senate.

His message: I will not seek a second term.

It took him 17 minutes to say that. He stumbled oh-so-many times over oh-so-many of the 2,400 words he and/or his speechwriter(s) composed for him that you have to think he was unaccountably overconfident of his speechifying abilities, despite years of evidence to the contrary. He might have read the thing over a few times before attempting to utter its content.

Ok, he loused up the speech, but why is he not seeking a second term?

President Trump is to blame, he said without mentioning him by name.

Mr. Trump has so lowered the tone and content of discourse in the world, in the U.S. and, most intolerably, in the Senate (where Mr. Trump does not have seat to sit on, as I recall) that it’s now beneath Mr. flake’s dignity to remain seated in the Senate seat he does have until January 2019.

Seems Mr. Trump out-insulted the junior senator from Arizona, who had written and published a book devoted to insulting Mr. Trump. In that contest to see who can stream used water farther, the president won. Now Mr. Flake knows how Little Ted felt.

OK, the discourse in the Senate is beneath Mr. Flake, thanks to Mr. Trump’s bad qualities of speech and temperament.

So why’d he really forgo a run for a second term?

You think Steve Bannon’s thundering pledge to find and field a challenger to Mr. Flake might have had something to do with it?

You think these Flake words answer the question?

“It is clear at this moment that a traditional conservative who believes in limited government and free markets, who is devoted to free trade, and who is pro-immigration, has a narrower and narrower path to nomination in the Republican Party — the party that for so long has defined itself by belief in those things,” Mr. Flake said at one point in his endless speech.

You think osteopathic physician Kelli Ward’s beating Mr. Flake in polls of 2018 GOP primary voters has something to do with it?

Mr. Flake was never exactly a hero to most conservatives, despite his lifetime American Conservative Union rating of 93 (he did score under 80 in the two latest ratings).

Mr. Flake thinks populism is for — well, for anything but fiscal conservatives

Mr. Flake thinks Mr. Trump is a flake on immigration. An ethnocentrist. A nativist.

Mr. Flake’s problem is that he doesn’t really get “E Pluribus Unum.” He doesn’t understand why fears continue to grow that America is becoming the salad bowl so many of us feared instead of the melting pot that it was founded to be — that created something new and original in the world — an American, with a unique culture and worldview.

He thinks “America first” is, well, dangerously nationalistic.

Mr. Flake has missed a lot of the changes taking place in our land. What he won’t be is missed.

The Justice Department also said on Wednesday it would not comply with a Nadler-issued subpoena seeking an unredacted version of Mueller ’ s report and underlying investigative files from the probe .
Earlier on Wednesday , Barr spent more than four hours before the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee where he fended off Democratic criticism of his decision to clear Trump of criminal obstruction of justice and faulted Special Counsel Robert Mueller for not reaching a conclusion of his own on the issue .
In his first congressional testimony since releasing a redacted version of Mueller ’ s report on April 18 , Barr also dismissed Mueller ’ s complaints that he initially disclosed the special counsel ’ s conclusions on March 24 in an incomplete way that caused public confusion .
Illustrating tensions between the two men , Barr described as “ a bit snitty ” a March 27 letter from Mueller in which the special counsel urged him to release broader summaries of his findings - a step Barr rejected .

Several Democrats on the Senate committee called for Barr ’ s resignation .
Democrats have accused Barr of trying to protect the Republican president , who is seeking re-election next year .

“ I don ’ t think the government had a prosecutable case , ” Barr said .
The report detailed extensive contacts between Trump ’ s 2016 presidential campaign and Moscow and the campaign ’ s expectation that it would benefit from Russia ’ s actions , which included hacking and propaganda to boost Trump and harm Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton .

Under questioning by Democratic Senator Kamala Harris , a 2020 presidential candidate , Barr acknowledged he did not review the investigation ’ s underlying evidence before deciding to clear Trump of obstruction .
Barr disputed the view that Mueller was handing the baton to Congress for possible impeachment proceedings . “ That would be very inappropriate , ” Barr said . “ That ’ s not what the Justice Department does . ”
The Democratic-controlled House would start any such impeachment effort , but Trump could not be removed from office without approval by a two-thirds majority in the Republican-controlled Senate .
Democrats also accused Barr of misleading Congress , by saying in April that he did not know whether Mueller agreed with his characterization of the report - failing to mention Mueller ’ s March 27 letter that Barr ’ s initial summary did not “ fully capture the context , nature and substance of this Office ’ s work . ”
Barr testified that Mueller was unhappy with the way the conclusions were being characterized in the media , not his account of the conclusions , although Mueller ’ s letter did not mention media coverage .
“ The letter is a bit snitty , ” Barr said , using a word meaning disagreeably ill-tempered , “ and I think it was probably written by a member of his staff . ”
Several Democrats demanded that Mueller testify before the committee , but Graham ruled that out .
Committee Republicans did not focus on Trump ’ s conduct but rather on what they saw as the FBI ’ s improper surveillance during the 2016 race of Trump aides they suspected of being Russian agents , as well as on the Kremlin ’ s election meddling .

Barr, appointed by Trump after the president fired his predecessor, Jeff Sessions, seemed to minimize the incident and said Trump believed “he never outright directed the firing of Mueller.” Trump could have presumably appointed someone else to do the job after Mueller was fired, he said.

“We did not think in this case that the government could show corrupt intent,” Barr said.

‘INTENTION WAS VERY CLEAR’

Democrats on the panel were unconvinced.

“I think the president’s intention was very clear. He wanted this to end,” Senator Dick Durbin said.

Under questioning by Democratic Senator Kamala Harris, a 2020 presidential candidate, Barr acknowledged he did not review the investigation’s underlying evidence before deciding to clear Trump of obstruction.

Barr disputed the view that Mueller was handing the baton to Congress for possible impeachment proceedings. “That would be very inappropriate,” Barr said. “That’s not what the Justice Department does.”

The Democratic-controlled House would start any such impeachment effort, but Trump could not be removed from office without approval by a two-thirds majority in the Republican-controlled Senate.

Democrats also accused Barr of misleading Congress, by saying in April that he did not know whether Mueller agreed with his characterization of the report - failing to mention Mueller’s March 27 letter that Barr’s initial summary did not “fully capture the context, nature and substance of this Office’s work.”

Barr testified that Mueller was unhappy with the way the conclusions were being characterized in the media, not his account of the conclusions, although Mueller’s letter did not mention media coverage.

“The letter is a bit snitty,” Barr said, using a word meaning disagreeably ill-tempered, “and I think it was probably written by a member of his staff.”

Several Democrats demanded that Mueller testify before the committee, but Graham ruled that out.

Committee Republicans did not focus on Trump’s conduct but rather on what they saw as the FBI’s improper surveillance during the 2016 race of Trump aides they suspected of being Russian agents, as well as on the Kremlin’s election meddling.

Barr indicated that to him, the matter was closed.

Miller","Senators were reaching for a deal overnight Sunday to try to end a 2-day-old government shutdown , hoping to prevent the worst of the effects of furloughs that hits in earnest on Monday .
Republican leaders made a last-minute overture , promising to hold a broad immigration debate over the ensuing weeks , but Democrats said that still wasn ’ t good enough to lift their blockade and allow the government to reopen .
“ Talks will continue , but we have yet to reach an agreement , ” said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer , New York Democrat .
But momentum was building against Democrats . Republicans — including several who had joined Democrats ’ initial filibuster on Friday — said they would vote to reopen the government on Monday , saying there is a plan now to address immigration and a host of other outstanding questions , including defense spending levels .
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , Kentucky Republican , tried to push the vote up to Sunday night , hoping to end the shutdown quickly , but Mr. Schumer objected .
The government careened into a shutdown Saturday morning after Democrats led a filibuster in the Senate to block a new round of government funding .
The effects were muted over the weekend , since most federal employees who usually work on Saturdays and Sundays are already deemed essential and had to show up — albeit without the guarantee of getting paid . Monday would be the real test , as hundreds of thousands of government workers would begin a furlough .
“ This shutdown ’ s going to get a lot worse tomorrow , ” Mr. McConnell , Kentucky Republican , said as he opened the chamber for a rare Sunday session .
He said blame for the shutdown lay directly at the feet of his Democratic counterpart , Mr. Schumer of New York , who led his troops in voting against a bill to fund the government through Feb. 16 . Mr. McConnell said Mr. Schumer was holding the government hostage to an illegal immigration debate that isn ’ t necessary for weeks .
Mr. Schumer said the shutdown happened because Republicans refused to cooperate with him .
“ It was their job to reach out to us and come up with a compromise . They have failed , ” he said .
The result was a shutdown all sides said they didn ’ t want but they stumbled into nonetheless .
For weeks , Democrats had issued demands that any spending bill would have to legalize illegal immigrant Dreamers , granting citizenship rights to perhaps millions of them . Republicans countered that any such deal would have to include more border security and changes to legal immigration policy .
Mr. Trump had said his border wall , limits to chain migration and an end of the Diversity Visa Lottery had to be part of the deal .
Sen. Lindsey Graham , South Carolina Republican , thought he had struck a deal with Sen. Richard J. Durbin , a leading Democrat from Illinois , on all four of those items , but it offered only 10 percent of the border wall and no significant cut to chain migration in exchange for a generous amnesty . Mr. Trump rejected the deal , calling it weak .
Mr. Schumer tried to resurrect the plan in a meeting with Mr. Trump on Friday , agreeing to even more wall money but refusing the other demands . Those negotiations also broke down , and Mr. Schumer said Americans would blame the president .
“ This will be called the Trump shutdown , ” Mr. Schumer said .
Even as the Senate was voting to filibuster , Mr. Graham was working on an exit plan . He had a bipartisan group of senators gathered around his desk , where he sold his idea to fund the government through Feb. 8 in exchange for a promise to debate immigration in coming weeks .
It took more than a day for that plan to gain traction , with a lack of trust poisoning the dialogue .
Mr. Schumer said talking with Mr. Trump was like “ negotiating with Jell-O , ” while congressional Republicans countered that Mr. Schumer couldn ’ t be relied on .
Mr. Schumer and the White House also traded accusations of misleading the public about discussions on the border wall during a Friday meeting between the Democrat and the president .
Given the frayed relations , Democrats were pushing for the stiffest possible guarantees they could get . They wanted Mr. McConnell to agree to a firm vote and had hoped to get House Republicans to follow suit .
Senate Republicans said there was no way an agreement could lock in the House , however .
“ I can ’ t guarantee our Democratic friends a result , but I think the majority leader is willing to make a proposal I can support , which is CR to Feb. 8 , taking up immigration if we don ’ t have a solution by then , ” Mr. Graham said .
Mr. Trump ’ s role in future immigration negotiations is also uncertain . Republican leaders have said the president must be on board before a bill reaches the floor , but Sen. Jeff Flake , an Arizona Republican and frequent Trump critic , said that could snag talks .
“ We can ’ t wait for the president to express support for something before we move to it in the Senate , ” he said .
As the shutdown continues , Mr. Trump ’ s campaign team released an ad saying Democrats who oppose the president ’ s border security policies will be “ complicit for every murder committed by illegal immigrants . ”
“ Build the wall . Deport criminals . Stop illegal immigration now . Democrats who stand in our way will be complicit in every murder committed by illegal immigrants , ” the ad by Donald J.

For weeks, Democrats had issued demands that any spending bill would have to legalize illegal immigrant Dreamers, granting citizenship rights to perhaps millions of them. Republicans countered that any such deal would have to include more border security and changes to legal immigration policy.

Mr. Trump had said his border wall, limits to chain migration and an end of the Diversity Visa Lottery had to be part of the deal.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican, thought he had struck a deal with Sen. Richard J. Durbin, a leading Democrat from Illinois, on all four of those items, but it offered only 10 percent of the border wall and no significant cut to chain migration in exchange for a generous amnesty. Mr. Trump rejected the deal, calling it weak.

Mr. Schumer tried to resurrect the plan in a meeting with Mr. Trump on Friday, agreeing to even more wall money but refusing the other demands. Those negotiations also broke down, and Mr. Schumer said Americans would blame the president.

“This will be called the Trump shutdown,” Mr. Schumer said.

Even as the Senate was voting to filibuster, Mr. Graham was working on an exit plan. He had a bipartisan group of senators gathered around his desk, where he sold his idea to fund the government through Feb. 8 in exchange for a promise to debate immigration in coming weeks.

It took more than a day for that plan to gain traction, with a lack of trust poisoning the dialogue.

Mr. Schumer said talking with Mr. Trump was like “negotiating with Jell-O,” while congressional Republicans countered that Mr. Schumer couldn’t be relied on.

Mr. Schumer and the White House also traded accusations of misleading the public about discussions on the border wall during a Friday meeting between the Democrat and the president.

Given the frayed relations, Democrats were pushing for the stiffest possible guarantees they could get. They wanted Mr. McConnell to agree to a firm vote and had hoped to get House Republicans to follow suit.

Senate Republicans said there was no way an agreement could lock in the House, however.

“I can’t guarantee our Democratic friends a result, but I think the majority leader is willing to make a proposal I can support, which is CR to Feb. 8, taking up immigration if we don’t have a solution by then,” Mr. Graham said.

Mr. Trump’s role in future immigration negotiations is also uncertain. Republican leaders have said the president must be on board before a bill reaches the floor, but Sen. Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican and frequent Trump critic, said that could snag talks.

“We can’t wait for the president to express support for something before we move to it in the Senate,” he said.

As the shutdown continues, Mr. Trump’s campaign team released an ad saying Democrats who oppose the president’s border security policies will be “complicit for every murder committed by illegal immigrants.”

“Build the wall. Deport criminals. Stop illegal immigration now. Democrats who stand in our way will be complicit in every murder committed by illegal immigrants,” the ad by Donald J. Trump for President said.

We asked 9 to explain what it does.,2017-09-20,"Jeff Stein, Jen Kirby, Ezra Klein, Alissa Wilkinson, Sigal Samuel, Terry Nguyen, Rebecca Jennings","Republican senators are struggling to articulate why they are rushing to pass their last-ditch effort to repeal and replace Obamacare over the next 10 days before running into their September 30 deadline .
In interviews with ███ on Tuesday , nine Republican senators primarily argued that their “ Hail Mary ” bill — spearheaded by Sens . Lindsey Graham ( SC ) and Bill Cassidy ( LA ) — would return federal power to the states , giving them greater flexibility to improve their health systems locally . “ The heart of the legislation takes the policymaking role of Washington and sends it to the states , ” Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said .
Far less clear is exactly how Graham-Cassidy would pull off this feat without resulting in millions of Americans losing their insurance — and the number of millions is still unknown , since any vote would likely have to come before the Congressional Budget Office completes its analysis of the bill . The GOP senators insisted that the tens of billions in cuts to federal health spending proposed in the bill would not result in coverage losses because , they said , the states would have more flexibility .
“ They can do it with less money , ” said Sen. Jim Inhofe ( R-OK ) , who was unable to explain how or why .
Other Republican senators , meanwhile , fell back on political explanations for a bill that experts warn could result in millions losing their insurance . “ If we do nothing , it has a tremendous impact on the 2018 elections , ” said Sen. Pat Roberts ( R-KS ) . “ And whether or not Republicans still maintain control and we have the gavel . ”

███ conducted the interviews with nine Republican senators throughout the Capitol and Russell Senate Office Building on Tuesday .
Sen. Pat Roberts ( R-KS ) : “ If we do nothing , it has a tremendous impact on the 2018 elections ”
Senator , I wanted to ask you for a policy-based explanation for why you ’ re moving forward with the Graham-Cassidy proposal . What problems will this solve in the health care system ?
That — that is the last stage out of Dodge City .
I ’ m just trying to explain to our readers what the policy —
... [ Graham-Cassidy ] is the last stage out of Dodge City . I ’ m from Dodge City . So it ’ s the last stage out to do anything . Restoring decision-making back to the states is always a good idea , but this is not the best possible bill — this is the best bill possible under the circumstances .
If we do nothing , I think it has a tremendous impact on the 2018 elections . And whether or not Republicans still maintain control and we have the gavel .
But why does this bill make things better for Americans ? How does it help ?
Why does this make things better ? What is this doing ?
Look , we ’ re in the back seat of a convertible being driven by Thelma and Louise , and we ’ re headed toward the canyon . That ’ s a movie that you ’ ve probably never seen —
So we have to get out of the car , and you have to have a car to get into , and this is the only car there is .
Sen. Jim Inhofe ( R-OK ) : “ Efficiencies ” from federal-state transfer “ can very well make up the difference ”
What ’ s the policy explanation for the Graham-Cassidy bill ? What substantive problems does this solve ?
Well , first of all , as a general rule the states do things better than the federal government does [ things ] . And that is essentially what the bill is . We actually had a bill that passed , except at the last minute — as you know — we had one deciding vote against it that was unforeseen . And I think what we ’ re looking at right now is essentially the same thing .
It ’ s a stronger position for the states to be in , and generally , Republicans agree with that .
I understand what you ’ re saying with the states having the ability to make these decisions , but the bill doesn ’ t just “ give states more freedom ” — it also cuts federal funding to the states . So it ’ s not just about giving the states more control ; it ’ s also about cutting federal expenditures , right ?
Well , yes , but that doesn ’ t mean it ’ s going to be — I think the efficiencies that come with transferring the funding to the states can very well make up the difference between what the federal thing would be .
I mean it ’ s more efficient when it ’ s done from the states , and so they can do it with less money .
Are you confident , and how do you know those savings will be close to enough to protect everyone ?
Sen. Ted Cruz ( R-TX ) : “ It lets states innovate and adopt creative solutions ”
I ’ m looking for a broad policy explanation for what Graham-Cassidy will do — how does it improve the American health care system ?
Well , the details of it are still being negotiated , but the heart of the legislation takes the policymaking role of Washington and sends it to the states . It lets states innovate and adopt creative solutions to local problems , which vary state by state .
But it ’ s not just devolving power from the federal government to the state . It also involves a 16 percent cut in federal spending [ upfront ] and a 34 percent cut over the next 10 years .
If you ’ re saying , “ Let ’ s just devolve power to the states , ” why also cut federal spending so dramatically ?
My central focus from the beginning has been on lowering health insurance premiums .
The biggest reason so many millions of people are hurting under Obamacare is that it has made premiums skyrocket . And what I think is critical for Obamacare repeal is that we expand consumer freedom so that you , the consumer , can be in charge of what health insurance you want to buy , and we lower premiums so that health insurance is more affordable . ...
Why not wait until the CBO says what you ’ re saying about premiums ? Why not confirm with them ? Over the first few votes , the CBO suggested that premiums would go up and that tens of millions of people would lose health insurance .
CBO ’ s analysis throughout this process has been ridiculously slow , unreliable , and based on policy assumptions that are demonstrably false .
You really believe that cutting federal spending by 34 percent will not result in any other people losing their insurance ?
Well , the Medicaid expansion would be sunset , for one , is my understanding .
The decrease in future rates of growth is not a cut . And it is only in the bizarre world of Washington that billions more money is characterized in the press as a cut rather than an increase , which is in fact what it is .
Sen. John Kennedy ( R-LA ) : “ Read the bill and you ’ ll understand ”
I think it ’ s an improvement over Obamacare , but I have sent four amendments to Lindsey [ Graham ] and Bill [ Cassidy ] that I think will strengthen the bill . The one I feel most strongly about is that I want the Medicaid work requirement — I don ’ t want it to be optional ; I want it to be a requirement . Just like we did with welfare reform .
And number two , I want to get us to give guardrails to the states to say , “ You can not use these moneys to set up a state-run single-payer system. ” I don ’ t believe in it . I think it ’ s a mistake .
I ’ ve lived under a single-payer system , and I think the bill would be stronger with that prohibition . [ That ’ s an apparent reference to England , where Kennedy received a law degree in the 1970s and which has the National Health Service . ]
Do you think that kind of goes against the idea of states ’ rights and being able to use this money [ as the states want to ] ?
No , no . We have plenty of federal rules that apply to every state , but we still agree with states ’ rights .
What are the main policy explanations for getting behind this bill ? What does this bill do right , policy-wise ?
My position has always been that , number one , I think Obamacare has been a failure .
Number two : First chance I get to vote for repeal it , I ’ ll do it .
And number three : If it ’ s replacement , if replacement is better than Obamacare , I will vote for it .
I think it spends scarce resources in a more rational manner . It will control costs . I like the idea that it encourages states to innovate .
Well , you ’ re voting for it , right ? So what is the explanation for how it does those things ?
I am . Because it gives states added flexibility . Read the bill and you ’ ll understand .
In broad strokes , what do you think this bill is going to accomplish ?
This is what a lot of us ran on — we ’ ve been advocating it for years . Let the states run it . They know more about it . They run the Medicaid program . They run our highway programs . We send 80 percent of money to various transit and highway stations — there , where the rubber hits the road .
But it ’ s not just that it devolves power to the states — it also involves a 16 percent cut in federal health spending .
But I ’ ll tell you what : Our states — our 50 states — are very flexible , very innovative . Much more so than we are here . I think it will work , and it will be a big step toward federalism .
The bill would cut federal funding to states by 34 percent over the next —
Well , do you think the other states should deal with —
Well , you see some of our states , four of our states , are getting a disproportionate amount of money from health care now . You know which ones .
Sen. Johnny Isakson ( R-GA ) : “ I do n't know what the numbers are going to end up looking like ”
What is the policy explanation for the Graham-Cassidy health care bill ?
Policy explanation ? I ’ m not into policy , so I don ’ t really know . I ’ m into facts .
[ In a follow-up interview hours later on Tuesday ] You were joking earlier , but what is the health policy in the Graham-Cassidy proposal that you like ?
The governors — I 'm from a state that did n't expand Medicaid , and the way we were going in health care looked like those states would actually be hurt worse than other states .
By going to block grants , back to the states , the control of money stays with the states , and you have less [ un ] predictability and external deviation in terms of funding .
So just a follow-up on that . It 's one thing to say the bill gives the states power — that ’ s one thing .
But it does n't just do that . It also cuts the money they have — some estimates say around 16 percent of federal funding .
I 'm not going to confirm that statement one way or another . I do n't know what the numbers are going to end up looking like .
Right , but if it does cut federal spending overall , would you support it ?
You know , those are dangerous questions . I 'm waiting until I see the totality of the legislation to say whether I support the whole thing or not , anyway .
I 'm not a no , but I 'm not a yes either — and I 'm waiting for my governor to respond to me with their input as well . It ’ s really key what they ’ re doing .
Sen. John Barrasso ( R-WY ) : “ The governors who decided to expand [ Medicaid ] knew that they were going to lose federal funding ”
I want to ask , in a big-picture way : What is the policy explanation for how this bill makes people ’ s lives better ?
It gets the money out of Washington , lets people at home make the decision , and gets state legislatures involved , and governors involved . It moves money out of Washington . It ’ s away from socialism .
CBPP says it will also reduce federal health spending on Medicaid and the exchanges by about [ 20 ] percent .
Right , but so it ’ s not just about moving power to the states — it ’ s also about cutting funding .
It ’ s about moving power to the states , where money can be spent much more effectively .
Well , you have to read the formula and read the bill , and it will tell you how it moves money to the states and how much they get and how much they don ’ t get . ...
There ’ s a concern from Republican governors who have come out and said , “ This is too dramatic a cut in spending ; we won ’ t have enough money to insure everyone . ”
Well , it depends on if they ’ re states that expanded Medicaid or not . ...
In the Medicaid expansion states , they still have a lot of people who rely on Medicaid expansion for health insurance .
I opposed Medicaid expansion . I think the Supreme Court got it wrong [ when it ruled in 2012 that Congress did have the constitutional authority to implement most of Obamacare ] .
The governors who decided to expand [ Medicaid ] knew that they were going to lose federal funding over time , and they ’ re objecting to that — but they knew it . You could say , “ Some of them didn ’ t understand it , and so-and-so wasn ’ t there , and he wasn ’ t governor yet , ” but they understood that this would be part of the process . So if they used the money poorly —
And my concern with Medicaid is that the people who Medicaid was designed for originally have been cut out of the process , because they ’ re still on the waiting list to get on Medicaid . I don ’ t know how much you understand about Medicaid , but this whole expansion of Medicaid went for healthy , working-age individuals — it did not go for the people who [ Medicaid ] was designed for , which was low-income women , children , and the disabled .
Sen. Luther Strange ( R-AL ) : “ I like the idea of sending money back to the states and letting the states experiment ”
I had a quick question on the Graham-Cassidy bill — could you explain what the policy purpose of the bill is ? What is this bill going to achieve , policy-wise ?
Honestly , I have a meeting to talk about that shortly — so let me get back to you on that shortly . I have to talk to my staff .
[ In a follow-up conversation with Strange about eight hours later ]
We ’ re still looking at the details on how it affects Alabama , so we haven ’ t taken a position on it yet .
I like the idea of sending money back to the states and letting each state experiment with what ’ s best for their citizens . But I haven ’ t seen enough detail to know how it affects Alabama to have taken a position on it .
Do you worry about the billions in cuts in federal health care expenditures ?
That ’ s the kind of detail I haven ’ t seen on how it would affect our state .
How it affects the state of Alabama , and how we are treated as a non-expansion state .
Will you be looking for protections for those with pre-existing conditions ? What else matters ?
Sen. Chuck Grassley ( R-IA ) : “ This is the last attempt to do what we promised in the election ”
I was hoping you could explain , in broad detail , what the point of Graham-Cassidy is .
Let me give you a political answer , and then I ’ ll give you a substance answer .
The political answer is that Republicans have promised for seven years that we were going to correct all the things that were wrong with Obamacare , and we failed the first eight months . This is the last attempt to do what we promised in the election .
The substance answer is that Obamacare starts with the principle that all knowledge about health care , and all decisions on health care , ought to rest in Washington , DC . The complete opposite of that is Graham-Cassidy , that Washington doesn ’ t know best and we ’ ll let each of the 50 states [ decide what ’ s best ] .

Sen. Pat Roberts (R-KS): “If we do nothing, it has a tremendous impact on the 2018 elections”

Jeff Stein

Senator, I wanted to ask you for a policy-based explanation for why you’re moving forward with the Graham-Cassidy proposal. What problems will this solve in the health care system?

Pat Roberts

That — that is the last stage out of Dodge City.

Jeff Stein

I’m just trying to explain to our readers what the policy —

Pat Roberts

What readers? Who do you represent?

Jeff Stein

It’s a website called Vox.

Pat Roberts

... [Graham-Cassidy] is the last stage out of Dodge City. I’m from Dodge City. So it’s the last stage out to do anything. Restoring decision-making back to the states is always a good idea, but this is not the best possible bill — this is the best bill possible under the circumstances.

If we do nothing, I think it has a tremendous impact on the 2018 elections. And whether or not Republicans still maintain control and we have the gavel.

Jeff Stein

But why does this bill make things better for Americans? How does it help?

Pat Roberts

Pardon me?

Jeff Stein

Why does this make things better? What is this doing?

Pat Roberts

Look, we’re in the back seat of a convertible being driven by Thelma and Louise, and we’re headed toward the canyon. That’s a movie that you’ve probably never seen —

Jeff Stein

I do know Thelma & Louise, sir.

Pat Roberts

So we have to get out of the car, and you have to have a car to get into, and this is the only car there is.

Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-OK): “Efficiencies” from federal-state transfer “can very well make up the difference”

Jim Inhofe

Well, yes, but that doesn’t mean it’s going to be — I think the efficiencies that come with transferring the funding to the states can very well make up the difference between what the federal thing would be.

A philosophical difference — you know?

Jeff Stein

No, what do you mean?

Jim Inhofe

I mean it’s more efficient when it’s done from the states, and so they can do it with less money.

Jeff Stein

Are you confident, and how do you know those savings will be close to enough to protect everyone?

Jim Inhofe

Well, nothing protects everyone.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX): “It lets states innovate and adopt creative solutions”

Jeff Stein

Ted Cruz

What federal spending is cut?

Jeff Stein

Well, the Medicaid expansion would be sunset, for one, is my understanding.

Ted Cruz

The decrease in future rates of growth is not a cut. And it is only in the bizarre world of Washington that billions more money is characterized in the press as a cut rather than an increase, which is in fact what it is.

Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA): “Read the bill and you’ll understand”

Jeff Stein

What are the policy explanations for the bill?

John Kennedy

I think it’s an improvement over Obamacare, but I have sent four amendments to Lindsey [Graham] and Bill [Cassidy] that I think will strengthen the bill. The one I feel most strongly about is that I want the Medicaid work requirement — I don’t want it to be optional; I want it to be a requirement. Just like we did with welfare reform.

And number two, I want to get us to give guardrails to the states to say, “You cannot use these moneys to set up a state-run single-payer system.” I don’t believe in it. I think it’s a mistake.

I’ve lived under a single-payer system, and I think the bill would be stronger with that prohibition. [That’s an apparent reference to England, where Kennedy received a law degree in the 1970s and which has the National Health Service.]

[Guardian reporter] Lauren Gambino

Do you think that kind of goes against the idea of states’ rights and being able to use this money [as the states want to]?

No, no. We have plenty of federal rules that apply to every state, but we still agree with states’ rights.

I think it’s an improvement over Obamacare.

Jeff Stein

Why?

John Kennedy

My position has always been that, number one, I think Obamacare has been a failure.

Number two: First chance I get to vote for repeal it, I’ll do it.

And number three: If it’s replacement, if replacement is better than Obamacare, I will vote for it.

Jeff Stein

What are the policies that make you think that?

John Kennedy

I think it spends scarce resources in a more rational manner. It will control costs. I like the idea that it encourages states to innovate.

Jeff Stein

How does it do that? Any of those things?

John Kennedy

Well, you need to read the bill.

Jeff Stein

Well, you’re voting for it, right? So what is the explanation for how it does those things?

John Kennedy

I am. Because it gives states added flexibility. Read the bill and you’ll understand.

Sen. Richard Shelby (R-AL): “It wouldn’t cut Alabama, though”

Jeff Stein

In broad strokes, what do you think this bill is going to accomplish?

Richard Shelby

This is what a lot of us ran on — we’ve been advocating it for years. Let the states run it. They know more about it. They run the Medicaid program. They run our highway programs. We send 80 percent of money to various transit and highway stations — there, where the rubber hits the road.

Jeff Stein

But it’s not just that it devolves power to the states — it also involves a 16 percent cut in federal health spending.

Richard Shelby

But I’ll tell you what: Our states — our 50 states — are very flexible, very innovative. Much more so than we are here. I think it will work, and it will be a big step toward federalism.

Jeff Stein

The bill would cut federal funding to states by 34 percent over the next —

Richard Shelby

But it wouldn’t cut Alabama, though.

Jeff Stein

Well, do you think the other states should deal with —

Richard Shelby

Well, you see some of our states, four of our states, are getting a disproportionate amount of money from health care now. You know which ones.

Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-GA): “I don't know what the numbers are going to end up looking like”

Jeff Stein

What is the policy explanation for the Graham-Cassidy health care bill?

Johnny Isakson

Policy explanation? I’m not into policy, so I don’t really know. I’m into facts.

Jeff Stein

[In a follow-up interview hours later on Tuesday] You were joking earlier, but what is the health policy in the Graham-Cassidy proposal that you like?

Johnny Isakson

More state innovation. More input from the states.

Jeff Stein

What does that mean, exactly?

Johnny Isakson

The governors — I'm from a state that didn't expand Medicaid, and the way we were going in health care looked like those states would actually be hurt worse than other states.

By going to block grants, back to the states, the control of money stays with the states, and you have less [un]predictability and external deviation in terms of funding.

Jeff Stein

So just a follow-up on that. It's one thing to say the bill gives the states power — that’s one thing.

But it doesn't just do that. It also cuts the money they have — some estimates say around 16 percent of federal funding.

Johnny Isakson

I'm not going to confirm that statement one way or another. I don't know what the numbers are going to end up looking like.

Jeff Stein

Right, but if it does cut federal spending overall, would you support it?

Johnny Isakson

You know, those are dangerous questions. I'm waiting until I see the totality of the legislation to say whether I support the whole thing or not, anyway.

I'm not a no, but I'm not a yes either — and I'm waiting for my governor to respond to me with their input as well. It’s really key what they’re doing.

Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY): “The governors who decided to expand [Medicaid] knew that they were going to lose federal funding”

Jeff Stein

I want to ask, in a big-picture way: What is the policy explanation for how this bill makes people’s lives better?

John Barrasso

It gets the money out of Washington, lets people at home make the decision, and gets state legislatures involved, and governors involved. It moves money out of Washington. It’s away from socialism.

Jeff Stein

CBPP says it will also reduce federal health spending on Medicaid and the exchanges by about [20] percent.

John Barrasso

I’d love to reduce federal spending on health insurance.

Jeff Stein

Right, but so it’s not just about moving power to the states — it’s also about cutting funding.

John Barrasso

It’s about moving power to the states, where money can be spent much more effectively.

Jeff Stein

How does it do that?

John Barrasso

Well, you have to read the formula and read the bill, and it will tell you how it moves money to the states and how much they get and how much they don’t get. ...

Jeff Stein

There’s a concern from Republican governors who have come out and said, “This is too dramatic a cut in spending; we won’t have enough money to insure everyone.”

John Barrasso

You have to interview them on that.

Jeff Stein

Do you think they’re wrong?

John Barrasso

Well, it depends on if they’re states that expanded Medicaid or not. ...

Jeff Stein

In the Medicaid expansion states, they still have a lot of people who rely on Medicaid expansion for health insurance.

John Barrasso

I opposed Medicaid expansion. I think the Supreme Court got it wrong [when it ruled in 2012 that Congress did have the constitutional authority to implement most of Obamacare].

The governors who decided to expand [Medicaid] knew that they were going to lose federal funding over time, and they’re objecting to that — but they knew it. You could say, “Some of them didn’t understand it, and so-and-so wasn’t there, and he wasn’t governor yet,” but they understood that this would be part of the process. So if they used the money poorly —

And my concern with Medicaid is that the people who Medicaid was designed for originally have been cut out of the process, because they’re still on the waiting list to get on Medicaid. I don’t know how much you understand about Medicaid, but this whole expansion of Medicaid went for healthy, working-age individuals — it did not go for the people who [Medicaid] was designed for, which was low-income women, children, and the disabled.

Sen. Luther Strange (R-AL): “I like the idea of sending money back to the states and letting the states experiment”

Jeff Stein

I had a quick question on the Graham-Cassidy bill — could you explain what the policy purpose of the bill is? What is this bill going to achieve, policy-wise?

Luther Strange

Honestly, I have a meeting to talk about that shortly — so let me get back to you on that shortly. I have to talk to my staff.

Jeff Stein

[In a follow-up conversation with Strange about eight hours later]

So what do you think?

Luther Strange

We’re still looking at the details on how it affects Alabama, so we haven’t taken a position on it yet.

I like the idea of sending money back to the states and letting each state experiment with what’s best for their citizens. But I haven’t seen enough detail to know how it affects Alabama to have taken a position on it.

Jeff Stein

Do you worry about the billions in cuts in federal health care expenditures?

Luther Strange

That’s the kind of detail I haven’t seen on how it would affect our state.

Jeff Stein

Anything in particular you’ll be looking for?

Luther Strange

How it affects the state of Alabama, and how we are treated as a non-expansion state.

Jeff Stein

Will you be looking for protections for those with pre-existing conditions? What else matters?

Luther Strange

All of the above.

Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA): “This is the last attempt to do what we promised in the election”

Jeff Stein

I was hoping you could explain, in broad detail, what the point of Graham-Cassidy is.

Chuck Grassley

Let me give you a political answer, and then I’ll give you a substance answer.

The political answer is that Republicans have promised for seven years that we were going to correct all the things that were wrong with Obamacare, and we failed the first eight months. This is the last attempt to do what we promised in the election.

The substance answer is that Obamacare starts with the principle that all knowledge about health care, and all decisions on health care, ought to rest in Washington, DC. The complete opposite of that is Graham-Cassidy, that Washington doesn’t know best and we’ll let each of the 50 states [decide what’s best].

The US Senate has approved the CIA's first female director, despite her role in the spy agency's post-9/11 interrogation programme.

Gina Haspel's confirmation in a 54-45 vote follows a partisan fight among senators about the CIA's Bush-era use of techniques such as waterboarding.

The former CIA chief, Mike Pompeo, left to become US Secretary of State.

Republican Senator John McCain - who was tortured during his more than five years in a Vietnamese prison - had earlier announced his opposition to US President Donald Trump's nominee.

On Thursday, six Democrats crossed party lines to vote in her favour.

One of them, Virginia Senator Mark Warner, said Ms Haspel had told him the agency should never have resorted to so-called enhanced interrogation techniques.

He said she had pledged never to use such methods even if the president demanded it.

Resolving Yemen’s conflict requires not only ending Iranian and Saudi complicity in the country’s humanitarian tragedy, but also removing Iran’s foothold in Yemen and its ability to destabilize the Arabian Peninsula.",www.foxnews.com,right,5U3Sqx5Jo1LcKCwx

A race to the middle

In an effort to reform rules that allowed political parties to throw combined support behind a preferred candidate, California voters approved the top-two primary system in 2010.

Big state, big money

A similar dynamic has played out between Harris and Representative Sanchez. Harris, the party favorite, is firmly liberal, and has the support of party leadership and President Obama.

Lessons emerging

A better grasp of how to run a campaign against a fellow party member could be crucial in future races, political analysts say – especially in California where the odds are that the 2018 gubernatorial race will see two Democrats vying for Jerry Brown’s seat.

He once called the “nuclear option” an “un-American” move that would destroy the Senate and “ruin our country.”

But on Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid did it anyway. He took the unprecedented step of gutting Senate filibuster rules for presidential nominees on a straight party-line vote, a high-stakes gambit that could have enormous implications for future presidents, reshape an institution he’s served in for 26 years, and ultimately define Reid’s legacy as one of the longest-serving Democratic leaders in history — one with a penchant for bare-knuckled tactics.

Story Continued Below

On the weekend of Nov. 9, Reid enlisted his top lieutenants, Sens. Chuck Schumer of New York and Dick Durbin of Illinois, to help take the caucus’ temperature. But after several weeks of counting votes, Reid was still encountering skepticism even among his confidants as late as Monday evening. He bucked up his troops ahead of the hugely controversial move.

“This is the right thing to do,” Reid told one of his closest advisers. “If I don’t do this, I might as well just walk away.”

As some of his fellow Democratic senators remained on the fence, Reid called in a heavy hitter to close the deal: President Barack Obama, according to sources familiar with the matter. Obama personally called senators on Wednesday to back the move, and Reid ultimately won the vote on a slim margin, 52-48. Just three Democrats broke with Reid: the retiring Carl Levin of Michigan, the moderate Joe Manchin of West Virginia and the vulnerable Mark Pryor of Arkansas.

When the seismic moment finally came, shell-shocked senators in both parties couldn’t believe that Reid pulled the trigger — and were grasping to understand the far-reaching ramifications.

Asked how history would remember him after this move, Reid told POLITICO: “I don’t write history.”

“For Harry Reid, this has always been about power,” said Sen. Mike Johanns (R-Neb.). “He rammed a rule change through. It’s historic.”

Indeed, for decades, Senate majority leaders have avoided using the manuever for fear that future majority parties would continually weaken — and eventually eliminate — the filibuster. The complicated parliamentary tactic known as the “nuclear option” allows the Senate to set a new precedent by a simple majority of 51 senators, rather than the typical 67 votes that are needed to change the rules by regular order. That means any majority can fundamentally weaken the filibuster without consensus of the minority party, effectively weakening its ability to block, delay or shape legislation.

Under the new rules, senators can no longer filibuster nominees to executive branch posts or the courts, with the exception of the Supreme Court. Legislation could still be filibustered, as could many other Senate actions.

But both sides readily acknowledge that future majorities will cite Reid’s precedent to continue to weaken the filibuster, potentially ending the delaying tactic on all bills and Supreme Court nominees and allowing a simple majority of senators to work their will.

“ We ’ re going to follow the regular order . It ’ s an important subject and we intend to review it on a bipartisan basis , ” he said when asked specifically if he would support a special bipartisan commission .

“ I would like , in an ideal world , to have a select committee , ” he CBS ’ s “ Face the Nation , ” explaining the leaders of the Senate Intelligence , Foreign Relations and Armed Services panels should play a role .
McConnell noted that McCain will be conducting his own review of cybersecurity threats facing the nation as chairman of the Armed Services Committee .

McConnell made clear views Russian President Vladimir Putin as more of an adversary than a friend .
“ The Russians are not our friends . They invaded Crimea , ” he said , noting that a group of senators this past week met with a delegation from Baltic counties .
“ To say that they ’ re nervous about the Russians is to put it mildly , ” he said .
“ We ought to approach all of these issues on the assumption that the Russians do not wish us well , ” he added .
He declined , however , to comment on the possible appointment of ExxonMobile CEO Rex Tillerson , who has close ties with Putin , to serve as Secretary of State .

“ Let ’ s wait until we get nominees , ” he said . “ I don ’ t want to comment on kind of a phantom nominee today . ”

McCain, a leading Senate voice on national security and the threat posed by Russia, also called Sunday for a special committee to delve into the issue.

“I would like, in an ideal world, to have a select committee,” he CBS’s “Face the Nation,” explaining the leaders of the Senate Intelligence, Foreign Relations and Armed Services panels should play a role.

McConnell noted that McCain will be conducting his own review of cybersecurity threats facing the nation as chairman of the Armed Services Committee.

McConnell made clear views Russian President Vladimir Putin as more of an adversary than a friend.

“The Russians are not our friends. They invaded Crimea,” he said, noting that a group of senators this past week met with a delegation from Baltic counties.

“To say that they’re nervous about the Russians is to put it mildly,” he said.

“We ought to approach all of these issues on the assumption that the Russians do not wish us well,” he added.

He declined, however, to comment on the possible appointment of ExxonMobile CEO Rex Tillerson, who has close ties with Putin, to serve as Secretary of State.

He said he’s “been very impressed with nominations,” adding, “we’ll have to see who’s nominated as Secretary of State.”

“Let’s wait until we get nominees,” he said. “I don’t want to comment on kind of a phantom nominee today.”

To hear Reid tell it , the party ’ s electoral collapse wasn ’ t a result of poor messaging or even a bad candidate . It stemmed from looser campaign finance rules , FBI Director James Comey and the influence of a few powerful individuals — namely the Koch brothers , his long-running nemeses .

To hear Reid tell it, the party’s electoral collapse wasn’t a result of poor messaging or even a bad candidate. It stemmed from looser campaign finance rules, FBI Director James Comey and the influence of a few powerful individuals — namely the Koch brothers, his long-running nemeses. The outgoing Senate minority leader is unapologetic on behalf of his party, and remains resolute that Democrats don’t need to chart a new political course after their 2016 debacle.

“They have Trump, I understand that. But I don’t think the Democratic Party is in that big of trouble,” Reid said in a half-hour interview with Politico on Wednesday, one day before he’ll deliver his farewell address. “I mean, if Comey kept his mouth shut, we would have picked up a couple more Senate seats and we probably would have elected Hillary.”

And Reid not only refused to admit any misgivings about invoking the “nuclear option” for most nominations — a move that’s backfiring now by empowering Republicans — he predicted it’s just a matter of time before the filibuster is done away with altogether.

Though the filibuster is Democrats’ best weapon against Trump, Reid said it would be a “mistake” for his party to reflexively oppose whatever Trump proposes. But the outgoing minority leader also wants Democrats to stand firm for their core principles, urging lawmakers to do “everything in their power” to block “wacky” Supreme Court nominees and to not be “complicit” in supporting GOP priorities like tax cuts for the rich and repealing Obamacare.

And Reid called a Republican senator a “loser” for his tirades against the Affordable Care Act, Reid’s signature legislative accomplishment as majority leader. It was a reprise of Reid's famous put-down of George W. Bush a decade ago.

The no-apologies, no-regrets posture was true to form for the blunt-spoken son of Searchlight, Nevada, who scrapped his way to the pinnacle of power in the U.S. Senate.

But this is hardly the scenario that Reid envisioned for his departure: with a President-elect Trump and all-GOP Congress firmly in control of Washington. And Reid’s most controversial move as leader — invoking the “nuclear option” on Senate confirmations — will leave his party essentially powerless to halt Trump’s Cabinet selections.

Reid insisted that it was the right thing to do.

“I don’t know if it’s my biggest achievement, but I’m satisfied we did it. We had to. Look at why it was done,” said Reid, who turned 77 this month. “We got almost 100 judges approved … we saved the integrity of different agencies of government. No, think of what our country would’ve been without that.”

Reid predicted that the 60-vote filibuster threshold for legislation and for Supreme Court nominees will ultimately disappear altogether — calling it a natural evolution of the chamber.

The rules are “going to erode, it’s just a question of when,” Reid said. “You can’t have a democracy decided by 60 out of 100, and that’s why changing the rules is one of the best things that has happened to America in a long time. It’s good for us, it’s good for them.”

Republicans blame Reid for most of the Senate’s stagnation in recent years, and his evisceration of the filibuster is one of their prime examples. Reid’s decision to water down the filibuster prompted now-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to declare that the Nevada Democrat will be remembered as the “worst majority leader ever.”

Three years later, Reid says he understands why McConnell responded the way he did.

“I have no ill will toward him. He was mad,” Reid said. “He got his rear end kicked, OK?”

Reid even admitted that while he disagreed with McConnell’s retaliatory tactics, which led to Merrick Garland being blocked from being confirmed to the Supreme Court, he had to give Republicans credit for the result: control of Congress and the White House and, in all likelihood, a more conservative Supreme Court in time.

“Mitch rolled the dice, and he won. I told him personally: ‘Mitch, I disagreed with how you did it, but it’s admirable that you did it,’” Reid recounted.

But though Reid largely spared McConnell from criticism despite their often-frosty relationship, not all Republicans escaped his wrath during the interview. After he changed the Senate rules in 2013, Republicans came to the floor daily to denounce his leadership. One of them, Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, hit a nerve with his criticisms of Reid and the ACA.

“He’s a loser,” Reid said of Barrasso.

“Here’s the deal with him. He came to the floor every day to berate Obamacare. He became the laughingstock of the Democratic Caucus. What good did he do? Nothing! I sent Durbin out once in a while to make him look like a fool,” Reid said. “The point is, he lost. He was frustrated.”

Barrasso was reluctant to respond. Pressed, he shot back at Reid: “He’s entitled to his opinion. And America has its own opinion.”

Democrats, though, are confident that history will remember Reid more kindly.

Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), who voted against Reid as minority leader in 2014 after the Democrats’ shellacking in the election that year, predicted that “Republicans and Democrats will reflect fondly on his tenacity. It’s one thing when you’re in the battle. It’s another thing when the battle’s a long time ago.”

“It was a masterful effort, and his critics who dismiss him as ineffective are ignoring the obvious,” added Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the second-ranking Senate Democrat, of Reid’s legislative record. “He’s left a great legacy.”

In some quarters of the GOP, Reid’s retirement is already drawing praise. Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a key ally of McConnell’s, said he met privately with Reid every time he was readying a major bill for the floor.

“Without fail, he’s made it easier to pass the bill,” Alexander said. “He’s helped me create an environment to succeed.”

That sentiment is more popular among veteran senators than newer members.

“I don’t have any sense of nostalgia about Harry Reid,” said Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.).

Reid is generally not one for nostalgia, either. But he recalls a time more than 40 years ago, when he became lieutenant governor alongside Mike O’Callaghan, the former governor who, like Reid, had little state government experience until he and Reid were elected in 1970.

One of the first tasks for the newly elected lieutenant governor was attending a state budget meeting. It was staffed by seasoned bureaucrats whom Reid knew were much more experienced and knowledgeable than either him or O’Callaghan.

But Reid also knew: He was the boss.

“And that’s how I kind of felt during my career,” Reid said. “I’m sure there are people more capable than I, better looking than me, better educated than me, smarter than me. But I’ve got the job. And I try to do the best I can with the job. … I look around and I say, ‘Well, I’m the one that has to do it.’ So I have done the best I can.”

WASHINGTON – Congress may be gridlocked when it comes to policy battles – but the the condemnation from lawmakers after allegations Sen. Al Franken harassed a TV host and sportscaster was incredibly swift on both sides of the aisle. So was the Minnesota Democrat's apology. An ethics investigation already appears to be in motion. And by the end of the day, the accuser already accepted his apology.

Leeann Tweeden's post that Franken kissed her against her will – and photograph of him groping her while she was sleeping on a cargo plane in a flak jacket during a Middle East trip to entertain U.S. troops in 2006 – sent shock waves through Washington on Thursday. But lawmakers' unity, and quick reaction, was notable for Capitol Hill, which has struggled to get anything passed all year on taxes or health care.

“We are at a watershed moment and now is the time for Congress to overhaul how it deals with the issue of sexual harassment,” Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the top House Democrat, said in a statement.

In a mid-morning post, Tweeden, who is now a morning news anchor on KABC Radio in Los Angeles, described how Franken, who was a comedian at the time, ""put his hand on the back of my head, mashed his lips against mine and aggressively stuck his tongue in my mouth."" Tweeden said the incident took place back stage when the two were practicing their lines for a comedy skit written by Franken.

No one asked whether Tweeden was telling the truth.

A national conversation about sexual harassment is ricocheting from Hollywood – where movie producer Harvey Weinstein stands accused of harassment and rape – to the halls of Congress. Franken is the first sitting lawmaker to be publicly accused of harassment.

And notably, no lawmakers on Thursday chose to defend the accused along party lines.

The Republican party in particular faces a test on the issue of sexual harassment as Senate candidate Roy Moore, an Alabama Republican who won his party's primary, stands accused of assaulting and harassing teenage girls when he was in his 30’s. A number of Republican senators have said believe the women, while Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has called on Moore to withdraw from the race.

Now Democrats, with the allegations against Franken, are similarly calling out their own. Several Democrats issued statements condemning Franken's behavior, including vulnerable Democrats like Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Joe Donnelly of Indiana. ""Comedy is no excuse for inappropriate conduct, and I believe there should be an ethics investigation,"" said McCaskill.

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., said she plans to donate the campaign donations she received from Franken’s PAC to Protect Our Defenders, a group that works on ending rape and sexual assault in the military. Her senior adviser, Glen Caplin, said that amounted to $12,500.

McConnell and Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., both called on the Senate Ethics Committee to investigate Franken's conduct.

Within hours of the first news reports, Franken also issued a statement apologizing to Tweeden – and called for an ethics investigation of himself. Tweeden later said she accepted his apology.

“There’s a heightened sensitivity that we haven’t seen in years,” said Bystrom.

There's still, clearly, a long way to go.

While a number of GOP senators said they believe the women accusing Moore of assault, Bystrom noted that initially, many Republicans equivocated by saying Moore should step aside if the allegations by several now-grown women that Moore stalked and groped them as teenage girls were substantiated. The “if true"" qualification was a theme of many Republicans' early reactions.

Senators cemented a deal to avert the “nuclear option” on filibuster rules on Tuesday.

Under the proposal, President Barack Obama would pull two nominees to the National Labor Relations Board — Sharon Block and Richard Griffin — and replace them on Tuesday afternoon with Nancy Schiffer and Kent Hirozawa, according to three sources.

Schiffer is the associate general counsel at the AFL-CIO; Hirozawa is the chief counsel to NLRB Chairman Mark Gaston Pearce and would be nominated to the seat on the board that expires in 2014.

The nominations are expected to move swiftly since without the two new members, the board would cease to function in August.

Under the deal to avoid the nuclear option, votes on the other five nominees would be allowed to go forward – including Cabinet nominations such as Gina McCarthy as EPA administrator and Thomas Perez as Labor secretary. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said those five nominees will get confirmation votes in the next two weeks.

“We have a new start for this body. And I feel very comfortable about it. I don’t know how I could be happier,” Reid said after the agreement was reached with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.

“It’s a step in the right direction that the majority has chosen not to exercise the nuclear option. We feel good about that, I think they feel good about it, so I think that crisis has been averted,” McConnell said.

Each side got a piece of what they wanted: Democrats will get seven of Obama’s nominees in place and Republicans were able to scuttle the recess-appointed Block and Griffin from the NLRB.

“They’re not sacrificing their right to filibuster and we damn sure aren’t giving up our right to change the rules if necessary,” Reid said.

Just before noon, the Senate voted to move forward with the nomination of Richard Cordray to head the Consumer Financial Protection Board with 71 votes — well over the 60 votes needed to break a filibuster — a breakthrough that allowed senators to back away from the brink of the historic rules changes.

us_senate,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/sep/20/new-obamacare-repeal-cuts-215b-states-overall-stud/,"New Obamacare repeal cuts $215B to states overall, study shows",2017-09-20,Tom Howell Jr.,"The Senate GOP ’ s last-ditch Obamacare repeal plan would slash federal funding to the states by $ 215 billion through 2026 , analysts said Wednesday in a study that finds less than a third of states would see an increase in funding compared to the current program .
If passed into the law , 34 states and D.C. would see cuts — seven of them would lose more than $ 10 billion — while 16 states would get more money , particularly Texas , according to Avalere Health , a D.C.-based consultancy .
The last-gasp GOP proposal , sponsored by Sens . Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana , would pool Obamacare money that currently subsidizes coverage for many who buy insurance on the exchanges and money going to expand Medicaid rolls , and siphon it all to the states as block grants . The states would tailor the money to their own health care plans starting in 2020 .
It ’ s the last repeal bill standing after the Senate GOP failed to rally around alternatives , though only 15 of the nation ’ s governors signed onto a Tuesdayletter in support of the state-empowering plan .
“ The Graham-Cassidy bill would significantly reduce funding to states over the long term , particularly for states that have already expanded Medicaid , ” said Caroline Pearson , senior vice president at Avalere . “ States would have broad flexibility to shape their markets but would have less funding to subsidize coverage for low- and middle-income individuals . ”
States that would win out through 2026 are predominately red states scattered across the Southeast and Midwest . The most populous state — reliably blue California — would lose nearly $ 80 billion by 2026 , the analysis says .
Also , the analysis says Florida and North Carolina — states that didn ’ t expand Medicaid and voted for President Trump , yet enrolled sizable amounts of people into Obamacare ’ s marketplace — would receive less money over the coming decade .
Avalere says the plan creates a funding cliff in later years , because the block-grant funding expires in 2026 .
Mr. Cassidy says not to worry , because the money is funneled through the Children ’ s Health Insurance Program , which is routinely reauthorized .
But analysts said Congress ’ ability to pony up more money “ is uncertain and could be constrained by the need to offset the cost . ”
Sen. Rand Paul , Kentucky Republican who opposes the plan , has warned colleagues that a future , Democratic-controlled Congress could change the formula to benefit blue states .
Avalere said converting financing to the Medicaid insurance program from an open-ended entitlement to a fixed , per-capita system will have long-term affects , meaning every state should see less money about two decades from now .
“ A combination of slower Medicaid per-capita cap growth rates and the sunsetting of block grant funding would lead to substantial reductions in federal funds going to states through 2036 , ” said Chris Sloan , a senior manager at Avalere . “ The largest negative funding impacts of this bill to states are outside the current 10-year budget window . ”
Alaska Gov . Bill Walker , an independent , cited Medicaid cuts in signing onto a bipartisan letter from 10 governors that calls on Senate leaders to abandon Graham-Cassidy and pursue a health care fix from both parties .
His voice could influence Sen. Lisa Murkowski , an Alaska Republican who could be the most pivotal holdout among the 52-seat Republican majority .
Republicans are scrambling to pin down at least 50 votes for the bill — Vice President Mike Pence can break the tie — before a Sept. 30 deadline to avoid a Democratic filibuster of their repeal plans under the 2017 budget rules .
Mr. Trump hopped off the sidelines Wednesday and urged Senate Republicans to rally around the plan . He singled out Mr. Paul , who says he will vote “ no , ” as a friend but a “ negative force when it comes to fixing healthcare . ”
Rand Paul is a friend of mine but he is such a negative force when it comes to fixing healthcare . Graham-Cassidy Bill is GREAT ! Ends Ocare ! — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) September 20 , 2017
I hope Republican Senators will vote for Graham-Cassidy and fulfill their promise to Repeal & Replace ObamaCare . Money direct to States ! — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) September 20 , 2017","The Senate GOP’s last-ditch Obamacare repeal plan would slash federal funding to the states by $215 billion through 2026, analysts said Wednesday in a study that finds less than a third of states would see an increase in funding compared to the current program.

If passed into the law, 34 states and D.C. would see cuts — seven of them would lose more than $10 billion — while 16 states would get more money, particularly Texas, according to Avalere Health, a D.C.-based consultancy.

The last-gasp GOP proposal, sponsored by Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, would pool Obamacare money that currently subsidizes coverage for many who buy insurance on the exchanges and money going to expand Medicaid rolls, and siphon it all to the states as block grants. The states would tailor the money to their own health care plans starting in 2020.

It’s the last repeal bill standing after the Senate GOP failed to rally around alternatives, though only 15 of the nation’s governors signed onto a Tuesdayletter in support of the state-empowering plan.

“The Graham-Cassidy bill would significantly reduce funding to states over the long term, particularly for states that have already expanded Medicaid,” said Caroline Pearson, senior vice president at Avalere. “States would have broad flexibility to shape their markets but would have less funding to subsidize coverage for low- and middle-income individuals.”

States that would win out through 2026 are predominately red states scattered across the Southeast and Midwest. The most populous state — reliably blue California — would lose nearly $80 billion by 2026, the analysis says.

Also, the analysis says Florida and North Carolina — states that didn’t expand Medicaid and voted for President Trump, yet enrolled sizable amounts of people into Obamacare’s marketplace — would receive less money over the coming decade.

Avalere says the plan creates a funding cliff in later years, because the block-grant funding expires in 2026.

Mr. Cassidy says not to worry, because the money is funneled through the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which is routinely reauthorized.

But analysts said Congress’ ability to pony up more money “is uncertain and could be constrained by the need to offset the cost.”

Sen. Rand Paul, Kentucky Republican who opposes the plan, has warned colleagues that a future, Democratic-controlled Congress could change the formula to benefit blue states.

Avalere said converting financing to the Medicaid insurance program from an open-ended entitlement to a fixed, per-capita system will have long-term affects, meaning every state should see less money about two decades from now.

“A combination of slower Medicaid per-capita cap growth rates and the sunsetting of block grant funding would lead to substantial reductions in federal funds going to states through 2036,” said Chris Sloan, a senior manager at Avalere. “The largest negative funding impacts of this bill to states are outside the current 10-year budget window.”

Alaska Gov. Bill Walker, an independent, cited Medicaid cuts in signing onto a bipartisan letter from 10 governors that calls on Senate leaders to abandon Graham-Cassidy and pursue a health care fix from both parties.

His voice could influence Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican who could be the most pivotal holdout among the 52-seat Republican majority.

Republicans are scrambling to pin down at least 50 votes for the bill — Vice President Mike Pence can break the tie — before a Sept. 30 deadline to avoid a Democratic filibuster of their repeal plans under the 2017 budget rules.

Mr. Trump hopped off the sidelines Wednesday and urged Senate Republicans to rally around the plan. He singled out Mr. Paul, who says he will vote “no,” as a friend but a “negative force when it comes to fixing healthcare.”

The July 4 recess is a time when members of Congress head back home to put on their ""casual"" clothes (khakis, patterned Oxford shirt) and hang with the regular folks, munching on hot dogs and walking in a few Independence Day parades. It's a chance to convene with the constituents, listen to their thoughts about the issues and challenges our nation faces, then head back to Washington revived and recommitted to this great experiment in self-rule.

But not this time.

On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell abandoned his goal of staging a vote on the Republican health-care bill before the recess, which he had hoped to accomplish before opposition to the bill could become too intense. That hope faded as GOP senators attacked the bill from both the left and right, making clear that it didn't have the votes to pass. So now the senators will head back home, to get confronted and yelled at by constituents angry about that abomination of a bill. While it's theoretically possible that over the break McConnell and the White House could induce more of them to vote yes, once they find out firsthand what their voters think, the chances of passage are likely to fade.

And their troubles are only beginning. The best-case scenario for the GOP may be to just let this bill go and move on, then hope to accomplish some of their other policy goals. Some have suspected that was part of McConnell's calculation in pushing this bill through so fast: Just get it over with quickly, so if it fails the pain of defeat wouldn't linger. The only thing worse would have been if it actually passed, and then they'd have to endure the backlash after millions lost coverage and deductibles and premiums skyrocketed.

This was never what Republicans wanted in the first place. They're not generally interested in complex policy challenges — this is the party that wants to dismantle government, not figure out how to make it work better — and they were particularly uninterested in health-care policy. How many Republicans wanted to become conversant in community rating and guaranteed issue and medical-loss ratios and risk corridors and actuarial values? Not too many. But Barack Obama forced the issue on them and so they pretended to care, at least enough to make promises about killing his hated law and replacing it with a glorious free-market solution that would be great for everyone.

Somehow they were never able to locate that unicorn. And now they face the prospect of a demoralized base, one that for a long time will distrust their party's leadership when it tells them of great things to come if they turn out to vote Republican. In recent years when that base criticized the party's leaders as weak and ineffectual, at least they could say, ""There's only so much we can do with a Democrat in the White House. Give us a Republican president with a Republican Congress, and just you wait to see all we'll accomplish."" Well now they have it, and they can't seem to get anything done.

That could be a serious problem in 2018, since midterm elections are always determined in large part by which party's supporters are more motivated to get to the polls. Even more important than the likelihood of dispirited Republican voters, the Democratic Party's voters are riled up and angry, eager to deliver a blow to President Trump and the GOP, and this argument over health care has only shown them why the stakes are so high.

But the effects of this debate are likely to persist long after 2018. Republicans have validated so much of what Democrats say about them: that they're heartless and cruel, that they're incapable of governing, that all they care about is delivering tax cuts to the wealthy. What answer will they have when Democrats say, ""The last time you were in charge, you tried to take health coverage away from 22 million people so you could give a tax cut to the rich. Why should we trust you now?""

One might ask if there was any better way to handle this challenge, or if it's simply impossible to design a health-care plan that would be consistent with conservative free-market principles yet not result in more people without insurance and higher costs for the poor and middle class. Perhaps the effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act was doomed from the start, particularly after the ACA had a few years to entrench itself within the health-care system. Perhaps Republicans created their own problem by being so vituperative and intransigent toward President Obama on this issue (and every other one).

us_senate,Politico,0,http://www.politico.com/story/2015/02/uncompromising-reid-still-in-command-115572.html?hp=t1_r,Uncompromising Reid still in command,2015-02-27,"Burgess Everett, Manu Raju","He only controls 46 seats , but Harry Reid is acting like he has 60 .
Reid ’ s uncompromising posture during the flap over homeland security funding and his emerging plans for an upcoming fight over immigration make clear he ’ s doing little to change the hardball style that defined his tenure as majority leader . This despite losing control of the chamber after last fall ’ s Democratic debacle and tamping down a coup among centrists seeking his ouster .
The 75-year-old Reid , who may seek reelection next year and is in his second stint as minority leader , is betting that Republicans are so nervous about being blamed for a crisis in Washington — as they have been repeatedly before — that they will capitulate again .
The new Senate majority leader , Mitch McConnell , wanted to initiate a lengthy floor debate on a House-passed Department of Homeland Security funding bill . But Reid surprised Republicans by rallying his caucus on four separate occasions to block the measure from even coming forward — demanding McConnell drop contentious immigration provisions . After a month of inaction in the Senate and up against Friday ’ s funding deadline , McConnell ultimately bent to Reid ’ s demands .
As House Republicans have called for formal negotiations on the Senate ’ s “ clean ” DHS funding bill , Reid has sent a blunt message across the Capitol : Take it or leave it . Most believe the House will ultimately take it .
That ’ s not all : As McConnell is pushing for a new plan to thwart Obama ’ s executive actions on immigration , Reid and his leadership team are warning they will prevent the matter from even coming to a debate before Congress funds the DHS . And even after Reid eventually agrees to debate the Republican plan on immigration , Democratic leaders are plotting a series of politically charged amendments that could put vulnerable Republicans and potential presidential candidates in tough spots . They will then try to filibuster the Republican bill to death .
“ He is controlling the agenda , ” Sen. Richard Shelby ( R-Ala. ) said of Reid . “ And he probably will control the agenda if we don ’ t change the rules . ”
Reid ’ s positioning underscores the painful reality Republicans face as they assume control of both houses of Congress : The position of Senate minority leader is one of the most powerful in the Capitol . Reid can delay and disrupt even the most carefully laid plans by the majority party , which needs 60 votes to break a filibuster . And nowhere has that been more clear than with the DHS funding battle , which has turned House Republicans against Senate GOP leaders , largely over their inability to win over any Democrats to break a filibuster .

Reid’s uncompromising posture during the flap over homeland security funding and his emerging plans for an upcoming fight over immigration make clear he’s doing little to change the hardball style that defined his tenure as majority leader. This despite losing control of the chamber after last fall’s Democratic debacle and tamping down a coup among centrists seeking his ouster.

Story Continued Below

The 75-year-old Reid, who may seek reelection next year and is in his second stint as minority leader, is betting that Republicans are so nervous about being blamed for a crisis in Washington — as they have been repeatedly before — that they will capitulate again.

Naturally, his unyielding stance has maddened Republicans.

The new Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, wanted to initiate a lengthy floor debate on a House-passed Department of Homeland Security funding bill. But Reid surprised Republicans by rallying his caucus on four separate occasions to block the measure from even coming forward — demanding McConnell drop contentious immigration provisions. After a month of inaction in the Senate and up against Friday’s funding deadline, McConnell ultimately bent to Reid’s demands.

As House Republicans have called for formal negotiations on the Senate’s “clean” DHS funding bill, Reid has sent a blunt message across the Capitol: Take it or leave it. Most believe the House will ultimately take it.

That’s not all: As McConnell is pushing for a new plan to thwart Obama’s executive actions on immigration, Reid and his leadership team are warning they will prevent the matter from even coming to a debate before Congress funds the DHS. And even after Reid eventually agrees to debate the Republican plan on immigration, Democratic leaders are plotting a series of politically charged amendments that could put vulnerable Republicans and potential presidential candidates in tough spots. They will then try to filibuster the Republican bill to death.

“He is controlling the agenda,” Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) said of Reid. “And he probably will control the agenda if we don’t change the rules.”

Reid’s positioning underscores the painful reality Republicans face as they assume control of both houses of Congress: The position of Senate minority leader is one of the most powerful in the Capitol. Reid can delay and disrupt even the most carefully laid plans by the majority party, which needs 60 votes to break a filibuster. And nowhere has that been more clear than with the DHS funding battle, which has turned House Republicans against Senate GOP leaders, largely over their inability to win over any Democrats to break a filibuster.

By relying on the same kind of stall tactics he has long accused GOP leaders of abusing when they were in the minority, Reid is gambling that voters won’t punish his party for obstructing business.

In an interview Thursday, Reid insisted that his approach is much different than the way McConnell ran the Senate minority after President Barack Obama took office in 2009.

“We have been very good this Congress,” Reid, wearing glasses shielding a badly injured right eye, told POLITICO. “When things come along we like, we pass them. The problem we had the last six years is they didn’t like anything, so they opposed everything. We don’t.”

So far, Reid’s positioning appears to be helping him with his internal caucus politics — similar to McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner in their respective caucuses. McConnell is eager to avoid a DHS shutdown that could be potentially damaging to his 24 GOP senators up for reelection, while Boehner is taking a hard line pleasing House conservatives. And Democrats are trying to strike the right balance between confrontation and conciliation — while unifying on procedural votes in an attempt to divide Republicans against themselves.

Reid’s tactics, as Washington Sen. Patty Murray told Democratic senators at a private party retreat in Baltimore last month, could be summed up like this: “It’s fine to work with [Republicans], but don’t be a cheap date.”

Reid most certainly isn’t. As part of his demands to keep the DHS funded past Friday, Reid and his caucus called on Senate Republicans to drop House-approved provisions, which would block Obama’s 2012 and 2014 executive actions deferring deportations and providing work permits for roughly 5 million illegal immigrants. Facing a recalcitrant Democratic Caucus and fearful of a DHS shutdown during a time of war, McConnell acquiesced.

They may soon have that opportunity.

Democratic leaders are weighing a series of hot-button amendments — ranging from proposing the Senate’s comprehensive immigration bill from the last Congress to the so-called Dream Act to provide a pathway to citizenship for young undocumented immigrants — partly to bolster their efforts to court Latino voters and put Republicans in a tough spot.

us_senate,The Atlantic,0,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/the-end-of-the-filibuster-no-really/ar-BB16X4rM,"The End of the Filibuster—No, Really",,,"Through the mid-20th century , southern segregationists relied on the Senate filibuster as their ultimate legislative weapon to block equal rights for Black Americans . Now the renewed struggle over those rights may doom the filibuster itself , perhaps as soon as next year .
With Donald Trump struggling in the polls , Democrats now are eagerly contemplating the possibility that the November presidential election could deliver the party unified control of the White House , the Senate , and the House of Representatives for the first time since 2009 . But that excitement is tempered by the recognition that under any scenario , Republicans will almost certainly still control enough Senate seats to block most of the Democrats ’ ambitious agenda through sustained filibusters .
That prospect raises alarms among advocates for a broad range of causes , including climate change and immigration reform . But after this spring ’ s nationwide outpouring of protest following the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis , many Democrats believe that if the party wins unified control , issues of racial inequity and civil rights may create the greatest pressure yet to eliminate the filibuster . That pressure will only grow if , as many voices are already urging , Democrats brand some or all of their voting-rights agenda as a tribute to the civil-rights pioneer and longtime Representative John Lewis , who died on Friday . Already , Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont said he would reintroduce one such bill to name it for Lewis , who he described as “ my hero . ”
Leaders of the burgeoning racial-justice movement are unequivocal in warning Senate Democratic leaders that they risk an eruption if they achieve unified control of government yet allow Republican filibusters to kill civil-rights initiatives that pass the House , as bills on police reform , voting , and other issues have in this session .
That “ will be unacceptable , ” Rashad Robinson , the executive director of Color of Change , a leading racial-justice organization , told me . “ It will be unacceptable to people who have waited a long time . It will be unacceptable to people who are already skeptical of electoral politics . It will be unacceptable that a body that is deeply unrepresentative of a diverse America is telling people to wait more time . ”
Aimee Allison , the founder of She the People , an organization that mobilizes women of color , sends the same blunt warning . “ It ’ s unacceptable to say there is nothing we can do , that we must be held hostage by Republicans who have enabled a Trump presidency and a set of policies that have hurt us , ” she told me . “ We can ’ t be held hostage by the filibuster . ”
[ David Litt : The Senate filibuster is another monument to white supremacy ]
Democrat Jeff Merkley of Oregon , the Senate ’ s chief advocate for ending the filibuster , agrees that civil-rights concerns ( along with climate change ) may be the issue that forces the party to roll back or eliminate the tool if they win the majority . “ I think it ’ s unacceptable to campaign on issues and to say you care about them , and then hand [ GOP Majority Leader Mitch ] McConnell the ability on behalf of powerful special interests to block those efforts , ” Merkley told me . On racial-equity policies in particular , Senate Democrats can ’ t allow “ one person the veto to stop them from happening . ”
The filibuster , which traces back to the 19th century , allows the minority party to block action on Senate bills by extending debate . In 1917 , the Senate required a two-thirds vote to end a filibuster ; in 1975 , that threshold was lowered to three-fifths , or 60 members in the current Senate . But the upper chamber can restrict or eliminate the filibuster itself with only a simple majority . A Democratic-controlled Senate voted in 2013 to end the filibuster for presidential appointees , including lower-court judges ; four years later , after Trump took office , Republicans abolished it for Supreme Court nominees too . “ The Senate seems to be on a very steady march towards majority rule , ” Sarah Binder , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution , told me .
But the filibuster , for now , endures for legislative proposals . While the budget “ reconciliation ” process could allow Democrats to pass bills related to federal spending—likely including plans to expand the Affordable Care Act—with a simple majority , that tool can not be stretched to encompass many other party priorities , such as immigration , gun control , LGBTQ rights , much of the climate agenda , and racial-equity issues .
Democrats , both inside and beyond the Senate , have been sharply divided on whether to try to end the filibuster ; several senators have expressed concern about losing their ability to stop Republican policies if and when the GOP next achieves unified control . Joe Biden , who was mostly a conformist during his 36 years in the Senate , has never expressed much enthusiasm for elimination , though last week he did say he ’ d “ take a look at ” ending the filibuster if Republicans become too “ obstreperous ” in opposition .
Merkley says his conversations with colleagues about the filibuster “ are different ” now than before—partly because the prospect of seizing Senate control is within sight , partly because they ’ re more and more frustrated by the erosion of open debate in the chamber . In addition to eliminating or restricting the filibuster , Merkely wants to restore senators ’ ability to offer unlimited amendments on pending legislation , something that McConnell and his predecessor , the Democrat Harry Reid , severely limited .
For most of the Senate ’ s history , “ amendments have been common and supermajority votes have been rare , ” Merkley says . “ Now it ’ s the opposite . The Senate has really deviated from its historic tradition … [ of ] every senator being able to put ideas on the table , force votes on those ideas , and therefore create accountability on those issues . ”
Several factors are converging to propel civil-rights concerns to the center of the growing debate over the filibuster ’ s future .
One is that Democrats are unlikely to win unified control in the first place without big turnout in November and big margins among voters of color . Another is that this spring ’ s protests galvanized attention on racial inequality for voters across the Democratic coalition . Adding to the pressure is the widening racial gap between the parties and the diverging Americas they represent . Republican senators largely represent the least racially diverse states , and almost all of them rely preponderantly on white votes even in states that are more diverse , particularly in the South . And because Republicans dominate less-populated states , the current Republican majority in the Senate won about 14 million fewer total votes than the Democratic minority , according to calculations by Molly Reynolds , a senior fellow in governance studies at Brookings . ( That tabulation excludes the two Republican senators appointed to their positions , Kelly Loeffler of Georgia and Martha McSally of Arizona . )
For all these reasons , many racial-justice advocates include the filibuster in their list of structural barriers that perpetuate white-conservative minority rule and unfairly impede the nation ’ s nonwhite communities from acquiring political influence commensurate with their growing size . ( Also on that list are the Electoral College , voter-suppression laws , and the constitutional requirement that each state have two senators regardless of population . )
Democrats can ’ t cede control on civil-rights and racial-equity issues to a “ group of senators who are less and less representative ” of the country , Allison told me . The “ filibuster is a tool that they use to impede progress . We have got to think about the broader structure in order to enable a multiracial-reflective democracy . If we don ’ t have those conversations—one protest to the next , one campaign fight to the next—it ’ s harder to gain traction and to craft a government that is more responsive to the people . ”
Another reason racial equity could be the issue that breaks the filibuster is the mechanism ’ s history . It is routinely used by the Senate minority to block action on almost any issue that can not be shoehorned into the reconciliation process . But for most of the last century , the filibuster was deployed primarily by southern segregationist Democrats , in many cases with support from Republican conservatives , to prevent action on civil-rights measures such as fair housing and anti-lynching laws . When the Senate approved the Civil Rights Act in 1964 , after a titanic four-month struggle on the floor , it was the first time the body ever broke a southern filibuster on civil rights .
If a Republican minority blocks civil-rights legislation again in 2021 , “ the pressure to get rid of the filibuster would be unbearable , and [ Democrats ] would have to get rid of it , ” predicts Adam Jentleson , a former deputy chief of staff to Reid and the author of an upcoming book about the Senate , Kill Switch . Starting next year , Democrats “ simply could not explain ” to their coalition and the broader public alike that they would fail “ to pass a new civil-rights agenda in deference to the procedural tool that was invented by segregationists to uphold Jim Crow and white supremacy . That is an unsustainable argument for Democrats to make . ”
Signals from the current Congress suggest this debate could gel very quickly in 2021 , because Democrats appear much more likely than in the past to generate simple-majority support for the biggest elements of the modern racial-equity agenda .
Long after the 1960s , the House Democratic caucus included a large number of members from southern and rural districts dominated by culturally conservative non-college-educated and non-urban white voters . Race-related policies often split the caucus in two . But especially since the 2018 midterms , House Democrats predominantly represent the nation ’ s major metropolitan centers , and they ’ ve shown extraordinary unity in passing a suite of civil-rights measures whose scale has generally been overlooked .
House Democrats have passed H.R . 1 , a sweeping election-reform bill that would vastly expand access to voter registration , mail balloting , and early voting ; reform the congressional-redistricting process and campaign-finance laws ; and undo some of the laws Republican-controlled states have passed to impede voting access . They ’ ve passed a new Voting Rights Act that would undo the Supreme Court ’ s 2013 Shelby County v. Holder decision , which opened the door to the wave of voter-suppression laws approved in GOP states in recent years . They ’ ve passed far-reaching police-reform legislation drafted in response to the Floyd protests . And they ’ ve passed legislation to make Washington , D.C. , with its large Black population , a state . House Democrats , incredibly , supported all four bills unanimously , except for a single “ no ” vote on D.C. statehood from Representative Collin Peterson , who ’ s running for reelection in a Minnesota district Trump won by 30 points .
If they retain their majority next year , House Democrats would unquestionably pass all of these bills again . And the companion bill to each of these has widespread support in the Senate . For instance , all 47 senators who now caucus with the Democrats have endorsed a new voting-rights act sponsored by Leahy , the former Judiciary Committee chairman , as well as the Senate companion to H.R . 1 .
In a world where Democrats achieve unified control , the filibuster will be the final obstacle for most , and perhaps all , of these proposals—not to mention sweeping immigration reform , gun control , workplace protections for the LGBTQ community , and other issues that the House would likely approve . And Democrats will know that control could be tough to maintain . The last four times a president—of either party—went into a midterm with unified control , voters have revoked it . ( That list includes Trump in 2018 , Barack Obama in 2010 , George W. Bush in 2006 , and Bill Clinton in 1994 . ) No party has controlled all the levers of government for more than four consecutive years since 1968 . In all likelihood , Allison says , unified government would provide Democrats “ a short window ” of opportunity after 2020 .
A Senate Democratic majority could vote to eliminate the filibuster immediately after it takes control , before any legislative action begins . But most political observers I ’ ve spoken to believe they may resist taking that step until they face a Republican filibuster blocking them on a specific bill they want passed—as Biden suggested in his comments last week .
That means one of the most important choices facing Democrats may be picking the issue that forces the filibuster ’ s future to a head .
Merkley predicts that even if Democrats can ’ t agree to end the filibuster on all legislation , they might be willing to eliminate it for measures such as H.R . 1 and the new voting-rights act . “ There ’ s such a sense that protecting and taking on the gerrymandering , voter suppression , and dark money is so important , it could well be a case … where every Democrat would come together to support a simple-majority ” vote requirement , he told me .
That would be a momentous step . But it likely wouldn ’ t satisfy civil-rights activists , who are impatient for action on other issues with more immediate effects on day-to-day life than changes to the underlying electoral rules . Which is why some observers believe police reform is the issue most likely to crystallize the debate over the filibuster .
Such people think a Republican Senate minority , conscious of history , might look to cut a deal on police reform , because they wouldn ’ t want that to become the dispute that potentially ends the filibuster—and positions them as the modern heirs to southern segregationists such as Richard Russell and Strom Thurmond . Yet few signs suggest that many Republicans would accept the reform measures that the House has already passed and might build on next year . And that could make police reform the crucible that ultimately cracks the weapon of the filibuster , forged into its modern form through decades of “ massive resistance ” to civil rights .
“ I do think it ’ s going to take a substantive issue to provide the motivation for senators to get rid of the filibuster , ” Jentleson says . “ In this environment , it is probably better to do it on an issue like police reform . There would be some serious historical continuity there that would add an extra layer of poetic justice to it . ”","© Paul Schutzer / The LIFE Picture Collection / Getty Images Senator Richard Russell of Georgia (center) meeting with southern colleagues about filibuster reform in 1959.

It will be unacceptable to people who are already skeptical of electoral politics. It will be unacceptable that a body that is deeply unrepresentative of a diverse America is telling people to wait more time.”

Aimee Allison, the founder of She the People, an organization that mobilizes women of color, sends the same blunt warning. “It’s unacceptable to say there is nothing we can do, that we must be held hostage by Republicans who have enabled a Trump presidency and a set of policies that have hurt us,” she told me. “We can’t be held hostage by the filibuster.”

[David Litt: The Senate filibuster is another monument to white supremacy]

Democrat Jeff Merkley of Oregon, the Senate’s chief advocate for ending the filibuster, agrees that civil-rights concerns (along with climate change) may be the issue that forces the party to roll back or eliminate the tool if they win the majority. “I think it’s unacceptable to campaign on issues and to say you care about them, and then hand [GOP Majority Leader Mitch] McConnell the ability on behalf of powerful special interests to block those efforts,” Merkley told me. On racial-equity policies in particular, Senate Democrats can’t allow “one person the veto to stop them from happening.”

The filibuster, which traces back to the 19th century, allows the minority party to block action on Senate bills by extending debate. In 1917, the Senate required a two-thirds vote to end a filibuster; in 1975, that threshold was lowered to three-fifths, or 60 members in the current Senate. But the upper chamber can restrict or eliminate the filibuster itself with only a simple majority. A Democratic-controlled Senate voted in 2013 to end the filibuster for presidential appointees, including lower-court judges; four years later, after Trump took office, Republicans abolished it for Supreme Court nominees too. “The Senate seems to be on a very steady march towards majority rule,” Sarah Binder, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told me.

But the filibuster, for now, endures for legislative proposals. While the budget “reconciliation” process could allow Democrats to pass bills related to federal spending—likely including plans to expand the Affordable Care Act—with a simple majority, that tool cannot be stretched to encompass many other party priorities, such as immigration, gun control, LGBTQ rights, much of the climate agenda, and racial-equity issues.

Democrats, both inside and beyond the Senate, have been sharply divided on whether to try to end the filibuster; several senators have expressed concern about losing their ability to stop Republican policies if and when the GOP next achieves unified control. Joe Biden, who was mostly a conformist during his 36 years in the Senate, has never expressed much enthusiasm for elimination, though last week he did say he’d “take a look at” ending the filibuster if Republicans become too “obstreperous” in opposition.

Merkley says his conversations with colleagues about the filibuster “are different” now than before—partly because the prospect of seizing Senate control is within sight, partly because they’re more and more frustrated by the erosion of open debate in the chamber. In addition to eliminating or restricting the filibuster, Merkely wants to restore senators’ ability to offer unlimited amendments on pending legislation, something that McConnell and his predecessor, the Democrat Harry Reid, severely limited.

For most of the Senate’s history, “amendments have been common and supermajority votes have been rare,” Merkley says. “Now it’s the opposite. The Senate has really deviated from its historic tradition … [of] every senator being able to put ideas on the table, force votes on those ideas, and therefore create accountability on those issues.”

Several factors are converging to propel civil-rights concerns to the center of the growing debate over the filibuster’s future.

One is that Democrats are unlikely to win unified control in the first place without big turnout in November and big margins among voters of color. Another is that this spring’s protests galvanized attention on racial inequality for voters across the Democratic coalition. Adding to the pressure is the widening racial gap between the parties and the diverging Americas they represent. Republican senators largely represent the least racially diverse states, and almost all of them rely preponderantly on white votes even in states that are more diverse, particularly in the South. And because Republicans dominate less-populated states, the current Republican majority in the Senate won about 14 million fewer total votes than the Democratic minority, according to calculations by Molly Reynolds, a senior fellow in governance studies at Brookings. (That tabulation excludes the two Republican senators appointed to their positions, Kelly Loeffler of Georgia and Martha McSally of Arizona.)

For all these reasons, many racial-justice advocates include the filibuster in their list of structural barriers that perpetuate white-conservative minority rule and unfairly impede the nation’s nonwhite communities from acquiring political influence commensurate with their growing size. (Also on that list are the Electoral College, voter-suppression laws, and the constitutional requirement that each state have two senators regardless of population.)

Democrats can’t cede control on civil-rights and racial-equity issues to a “group of senators who are less and less representative” of the country, Allison told me. The “filibuster is a tool that they use to impede progress. We have got to think about the broader structure in order to enable a multiracial-reflective democracy. If we don’t have those conversations—one protest to the next, one campaign fight to the next—it’s harder to gain traction and to craft a government that is more responsive to the people.”

Another reason racial equity could be the issue that breaks the filibuster is the mechanism’s history. It is routinely used by the Senate minority to block action on almost any issue that cannot be shoehorned into the reconciliation process. But for most of the last century, the filibuster was deployed primarily by southern segregationist Democrats, in many cases with support from Republican conservatives, to prevent action on civil-rights measures such as fair housing and anti-lynching laws. When the Senate approved the Civil Rights Act in 1964, after a titanic four-month struggle on the floor, it was the first time the body ever broke a southern filibuster on civil rights.

If a Republican minority blocks civil-rights legislation again in 2021, “the pressure to get rid of the filibuster would be unbearable, and [Democrats] would have to get rid of it,” predicts Adam Jentleson, a former deputy chief of staff to Reid and the author of an upcoming book about the Senate, Kill Switch. Starting next year, Democrats “simply could not explain” to their coalition and the broader public alike that they would fail “to pass a new civil-rights agenda in deference to the procedural tool that was invented by segregationists to uphold Jim Crow and white supremacy. That is an unsustainable argument for Democrats to make.”

Signals from the current Congress suggest this debate could gel very quickly in 2021, because Democrats appear much more likely than in the past to generate simple-majority support for the biggest elements of the modern racial-equity agenda.

Long after the 1960s, the House Democratic caucus included a large number of members from southern and rural districts dominated by culturally conservative non-college-educated and non-urban white voters. Race-related policies often split the caucus in two. But especially since the 2018 midterms, House Democrats predominantly represent the nation’s major metropolitan centers, and they’ve shown extraordinary unity in passing a suite of civil-rights measures whose scale has generally been overlooked.

[Read: Abolishing the filibuster is unavoidable for Democrats]

House Democrats have passed H.R. 1, a sweeping election-reform bill that would vastly expand access to voter registration, mail balloting, and early voting; reform the congressional-redistricting process and campaign-finance laws; and undo some of the laws Republican-controlled states have passed to impede voting access. They’ve passed a new Voting Rights Act that would undo the Supreme Court’s 2013 Shelby County v. Holder decision, which opened the door to the wave of voter-suppression laws approved in GOP states in recent years. They’ve passed far-reaching police-reform legislation drafted in response to the Floyd protests. And they’ve passed legislation to make Washington, D.C., with its large Black population, a state. House Democrats, incredibly, supported all four bills unanimously, except for a single “no” vote on D.C. statehood from Representative Collin Peterson, who’s running for reelection in a Minnesota district Trump won by 30 points.

If they retain their majority next year, House Democrats would unquestionably pass all of these bills again. And the companion bill to each of these has widespread support in the Senate. For instance, all 47 senators who now caucus with the Democrats have endorsed a new voting-rights act sponsored by Leahy, the former Judiciary Committee chairman, as well as the Senate companion to H.R. 1.

In a world where Democrats achieve unified control, the filibuster will be the final obstacle for most, and perhaps all, of these proposals—not to mention sweeping immigration reform, gun control, workplace protections for the LGBTQ community, and other issues that the House would likely approve. And Democrats will know that control could be tough to maintain. The last four times a president—of either party—went into a midterm with unified control, voters have revoked it. (That list includes Trump in 2018, Barack Obama in 2010, George W. Bush in 2006, and Bill Clinton in 1994.) No party has controlled all the levers of government for more than four consecutive years since 1968. In all likelihood, Allison says, unified government would provide Democrats “a short window” of opportunity after 2020.

A Senate Democratic majority could vote to eliminate the filibuster immediately after it takes control, before any legislative action begins. But most political observers I’ve spoken to believe they may resist taking that step until they face a Republican filibuster blocking them on a specific bill they want passed—as Biden suggested in his comments last week.

That means one of the most important choices facing Democrats may be picking the issue that forces the filibuster’s future to a head.

Merkley predicts that even if Democrats can’t agree to end the filibuster on all legislation, they might be willing to eliminate it for measures such as H.R. 1 and the new voting-rights act. “There’s such a sense that protecting and taking on the gerrymandering, voter suppression, and dark money is so important, it could well be a case … where every Democrat would come together to support a simple-majority” vote requirement, he told me.

That would be a momentous step. But it likely wouldn’t satisfy civil-rights activists, who are impatient for action on other issues with more immediate effects on day-to-day life than changes to the underlying electoral rules. Which is why some observers believe police reform is the issue most likely to crystallize the debate over the filibuster.

Such people think a Republican Senate minority, conscious of history, might look to cut a deal on police reform, because they wouldn’t want that to become the dispute that potentially ends the filibuster—and positions them as the modern heirs to southern segregationists such as Richard Russell and Strom Thurmond. Yet few signs suggest that many Republicans would accept the reform measures that the House has already passed and might build on next year. And that could make police reform the crucible that ultimately cracks the weapon of the filibuster, forged into its modern form through decades of “massive resistance” to civil rights.

“I do think it’s going to take a substantive issue to provide the motivation for senators to get rid of the filibuster,” Jentleson says. “In this environment, it is probably better to do it on an issue like police reform. There would be some serious historical continuity there that would add an extra layer of poetic justice to it.”",www.msn.com,left,5O8UlaKNiQAjt5uY

What are the implications of today 's vote ? First , it looks like the federal government is going to reopen in short order . The `` shutdown '' was brief and pretty painless -- especially because the Trump administration smartly went out of its way to minimize negative repercussions . This marked a very different approach from the Obama administration , which deliberately and shamefully tried to inflict as much shutdown-related inconvenience and pain upon ordinary Americans as possible , for nakedly political reasons . Second , the bill that now appears destined for passage is almost identical to the one Democrats filibustered on Friday , guaranteeing the shutdown . The only substantive difference is that the government will be funded for roughly one week less . Friday 's legislation kept the government open through February 16 ; This one does so through February 8 . Everything else is the same , including the extension of CHIP for six years , and the additional delays of several Obamacare taxes .
But there 's another twist , too . The GOP has argued , rightly , that a DACA/immigration compromise should be pursued on a separate track from government funding . What McConnell has worked out with his members is a commitment to allow an open process of amendments and votes on DACA and border security bills if no broad agreement is reached prior to February 8 . He also said he 'd move to address other outstanding issues too . One caveat : He said clearly that he will not allow these processes to move forward if Democrats shut down the government again . Here 's his floor speech delivered shortly after the chamber reconvened this morning , setting the stage for the successful cloture vote ( breaking the Democrats ' filibuster ) moments ago :
`` At twelve o ’ clock , we will vote to end the Democratic Leader ’ s filibuster and advance instead a bipartisan bill that would put this mess behind us . The bill before us does three things that every Democrat and Republican should be able to support . First , it ends this shutdown and restores full funding for the federal government through February 8th . Second , it extends health insurance for nine million vulnerable children . And third , it will enable Congress to resume serious , bipartisan talks on the important issues facing our nation ... Should these issues not be resolved by the time the funding bill before us expires on February 8th , so long as the government remains open it – so long as it remains open – it would be my intention to take up legislation here in the Senate that would address DACA , border security , and related issues – as well as disaster relief , defense funding , health care , and other important matters ... But it is abundantly clear that the Senate can not make progress on any of these crucial matters until the government is re-opened . We need to move forward . The first step is ending this shutdown . ''
As for DACA and immigration , the majority leader sketched out how he will approach votes on those complex isues : `` Let me be clear , this immigration debate will have a level playing field at the outset , and an amendment process that is fair to all sides . And it would be my strong preference for the Senate to consider a proposal that can be signed into law . A bipartisan , bicameral group is already negotiating , and I look forward to the completion of its work , '' he said . Meaning : No DACA/security deal will be prioritized over any other , and each side will have fair opportunities to offer amendments . Subtext : The 'bipartisan , bicameral ' working group he references ( which includes John Cornyn and Kevin McCarthy ) has the best chance of passing both houses and being signed by Trump .
As we saw with the 'Gang of Eight ' in 2013 , producing a feel-good bipartisan consensus bill from the Senate does not mean that the more conservative House GOP majority will even consider it , let alone enact it . The goal should be passing legislation that can actually become law . And that will require a fair and equitable legal resolution for the DREAMers and meaningful border security and immigration enforcement . Parting thought : Does this inevitable Democratic cave genuinely infuriate lefty immigration activists , or is this just transitory sound and fury ?
Top immig activist on Schumer . “ if the shutdown ends because Democrats blink first , the era of good feeling quickly will be replaced by anger and disappointment . '' ( from @ AP ) https : //t.co/kn6yKxqWCk — Kathleen Hennessey ( @ khennessey ) January 22 , 2018
Of course , I can imagine the left-wing base being fairly upset ( `` miscalculated beyond belief '' ) over today 's vote . Democrats got ... nothing , essentially :
If this thing passes at noon , WOW . Democrats got nothing in this . Can someone please remind me why this happened to begin with ? Was n't it abt a DACA deal ? There is no DACA deal — Rachael Bade ( @ rachaelmbade ) January 22 , 2018

This marked a very different approach from the Obama administration, which deliberately and shamefully tried to inflict as much shutdown-related inconvenience and pain upon ordinary Americans as possible, for nakedly political reasons. Second, the bill that now appears destined for passage is almost identical to the one Democrats filibustered on Friday, guaranteeing the shutdown. The only substantive difference is that the government will be funded for roughly one week less. Friday's legislation kept the government open through February 16; This one does so through February 8. Everything else is the same, including the extension of CHIP for six years, and the additional delays of several Obamacare taxes.



But there's another twist, too. The GOP has argued, rightly, that a DACA/immigration compromise should be pursued on a separate track from government funding. What McConnell has worked out with his members is a commitment to allow an open process of amendments and votes on DACA and border security bills if no broad agreement is reached prior to February 8. He also said he'd move to address other outstanding issues too. One caveat: He said clearly that he will not allow these processes to move forward if Democrats shut down the government again. Here's his floor speech delivered shortly after the chamber reconvened this morning, setting the stage for the successful cloture vote (breaking the Democrats' filibuster) moments ago:

""At twelve o’clock, we will vote to end the Democratic Leader’s filibuster and advance instead a bipartisan bill that would put this mess behind us. The bill before us does three things that every Democrat and Republican should be able to support. First, it ends this shutdown and restores full funding for the federal government through February 8th. Second, it extends health insurance for nine million vulnerable children. And third, it will enable Congress to resume serious, bipartisan talks on the important issues facing our nation...Should these issues not be resolved by the time the funding bill before us expires on February 8th, so long as the government remains open it – so long as it remains open – it would be my intention to take up legislation here in the Senate that would address DACA, border security, and related issues – as well as disaster relief, defense funding, health care, and other important matters...But it is abundantly clear that the Senate cannot make progress on any of these crucial matters until the government is re-opened. We need to move forward. The first step is ending this shutdown.""

As for DACA and immigration, the majority leader sketched out how he will approach votes on those complex isues: ""Let me be clear, this immigration debate will have a level playing field at the outset, and an amendment process that is fair to all sides. And it would be my strong preference for the Senate to consider a proposal that can be signed into law. A bipartisan, bicameral group is already negotiating, and I look forward to the completion of its work,"" he said. Meaning: No DACA/security deal will be prioritized over any other, and each side will have fair opportunities to offer amendments. Subtext: The 'bipartisan, bicameral' working group he references (which includes John Cornyn and Kevin McCarthy) has the best chance of passing both houses and being signed by Trump.



As we saw with the 'Gang of Eight' in 2013, producing a feel-good bipartisan consensus bill from the Senate does not mean that the more conservative House GOP majority will even consider it, let alone enact it. The goal should be passing legislation that can actually become law. And that will require a fair and equitable legal resolution for the DREAMers and meaningful border security and immigration enforcement. Parting thought: Does this inevitable Democratic cave genuinely infuriate lefty immigration activists, or is this just transitory sound and fury?

Of course, I can imagine the left-wing base being fairly upset (""miscalculated beyond belief"") over today's vote. Democrats got...nothing, essentially:

""You know I don't walk and talk"" Ryan replied.

Democrats are gloating

Democrats have been furious about Republican efforts to gut Obamacare, former President Barack Obama's landmark accomplishment. But Monday's CBO report appeared to put some Democrats in a visibly good mood as they watched their GOP colleagues squirm.

McGrath , 45 , held off fellow Democrat Charles Booker , a state legislator , who had surged late in the campaign as protests spread across the United States over police violence against Black people .
With all Kentucky ’ s counties reporting , McGrath won 45.4 % of the vote to 42.6 % for Booker , Kentucky officials said . The primary took place on June 23 , but mailed ballots were accepted through Saturday , delaying the final results .
Booker conceded the race , but said he was concerned some Kentuckians could not check the status of their mailed ballots online .
“ Let ’ s dedicate to the work of beating Mitch , so that we can get him out of the way , ” Booker said in a statement .
McConnell , 78 , the most powerful Republican in Congress and a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump , is seeking a seventh six-year term .
“ Last November , Kentuckians didn ’ t hesitate to replace an incompetent and unpopular incumbent . This November , we ’ re going to do it again , ” McGrath wrote on Twitter , referring to Democratic Governor Andy Beshear ’ s 2019 defeat of Republican Matt Bevin .

McGrath, 45, held off fellow Democrat Charles Booker, a state legislator, who had surged late in the campaign as protests spread across the United States over police violence against Black people.

With all Kentucky’s counties reporting, McGrath won 45.4% of the vote to 42.6% for Booker, Kentucky officials said. The primary took place on June 23, but mailed ballots were accepted through Saturday, delaying the final results.

Booker conceded the race, but said he was concerned some Kentuckians could not check the status of their mailed ballots online.

“Let’s dedicate to the work of beating Mitch, so that we can get him out of the way,” Booker said in a statement.

McConnell, 78, the most powerful Republican in Congress and a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump, is seeking a seventh six-year term.

“Last November, Kentuckians didn’t hesitate to replace an incompetent and unpopular incumbent. This November, we’re going to do it again,” McGrath wrote on Twitter, referring to Democratic Governor Andy Beshear’s 2019 defeat of Republican Matt Bevin.

McGrath won establishment Democrats’ backing early in her campaign, and raised a massive $41 million.

Emphasizing her military experience, she often stressed that she was the “only candidate who can win” against McConnell, who has represented Kentucky in the Senate for over three decades.

McGrath follows in the mold of a handful of freshmen Democratic women with national security experience who helped flip Republican House of Representatives seats in 2018. She spent 20 years in the Marines, flying 89 combat missions.

Grassley told Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland to his face Tuesday that the Senate won ’ t consider his nomination , sparking a fresh round of partisan criticism and praise for the veteran lawmaker at the center of the battle .
Over breakfast with the nominee , the Iowa Republican “ explained why the Senate won ’ t be moving forward during this hyper-partisan election year , ” his office said . The statement added that Mr. Grassley “ thanked Judge Garland for his service ” and that their 70-minute breakfast meeting in the Senate dining room was “ cordial and pleasant . ”
“ It was a very friendly meeting , ” Mr. Grassley later told CNN . “ I enjoyed talking to him , but nothing has changed . ”
Mr. Grassley and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are blocking Judge Garland ’ s nomination , saying voters should have a role in filling the high court vacancy by electing a new president to choose a nominee . President Obama and his progressive allies are trying to ramp up pressure on Republicans to hold a confirmation vote .
The White House rounded up 15 former presidents of the American Bar Association to urge the Senate to move forward with the nomination .
“ This is a dereliction by the Senate , if it ’ s going to engage in willful ignorance about the qualifications of a nominee to the Supreme Court of this country , ” William Neukom , who led the organization from 2007 to 2008 , told reporters on a conference call .
Mr. McConnell , who won ’ t meet with Judge Garland , said the majority of the Senate already has spoken .
“ Fifty-two senators said they believe the next president ought to make this appointment , and the next Senate would decide how to dispose of that under the advise and consent , ” he said .
The White House and its Democratic allies pushed the theme that courtesy meetings with the nominee behind closed doors should lead to confirmation hearings .
“ These private meetings are a good thing , and a good first step , but the American people deserve to hear from Judge Garland in public hearings , ” said Sen. Charles E. Schumer , New York Democrat . “ What are the Republicans afraid of ? Are they afraid the American people will see an eminently qualified jurist ? ”
The head of a conservative activist group opposing the Garland nomination praised Mr. Grassley for holding firm to his position .
“ The American people are grateful that Senator Grassley is standing up to President Obama ’ s cynical attempt to force the Senate to confirm Merrick Garland , another liberal judge who will ensure the Left dominates the Supreme Court for a generation or more , ” said Carrie Severino , chief counsel and policy director of the Judicial Crisis Network . “ Senator Grassley understands that Merrick Garland will be the decisive fifth vote on the Court to gut the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms and the fifth vote to defer to unaccountable bureaucrats at federal agencies like the EPA . We thank Senator Grassley for standing with us . ”
But Mr. Grassley got a heavy dose of criticism on his official Instagram account after posting a photo of his meeting with Judge Garland and commenting that he had “ explained why the Senate won ’ t be moving fwd w his nomination . ”
“ This kind of partisan politics makes me sick , ” one follower told Mr. Grassley in a response that was typical of dozens of negative postings . “ Quit playing games and do your job . ”
The six-term senator is up for re-election this year , and has said his campaign won ’ t be a “ slam dunk. ” He is expected to face former Iowa Lt. Gov . Patty Judge , who is running for the Democratic nomination . Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid of Nevada has called her “ one judge that Senator Grassley can ’ t ignore . ”
Mr. Grassley also became the target of a potty-humor ad campaign by the liberal group Agenda Project Action Fund , the same organization responsible for the 2011 media campaign that accused Republican Rep. Paul D. Ryan of pushing “ granny off a cliff ” with his Medicare reform plan . The new ad accuses Mr. Grassley of “ stalling ” on the Garland nomination and depicts him hiding from inquiring journalists in a bathroom stall while he reads an Ayn Rand novel , his pants down around his ankles .
“ Republicans like Senator Grassley have again and again demonstrated just how highly they view the American public , ” said Agenda Project Action Fund President Erik Altieri . “ Stop defecating on the responsibilities of your office , senator , it is time to start doing the people ’ s business instead of your own . ”
Judge Garland ’ s meeting Tuesday with Mr. Grassley was a higher-stakes sequel to their encounter of 20 years ago , when the Iowa Republican fought against Judge Garland ’ s nomination for a seat on a key federal appellate court .
Mr. Grassley led the battle in 1995 and 1996 against President Bill Clinton ’ s nomination of Judge Garland to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia , in a dispute over the number of judges on a court viewed as a steppingstone to the Supreme Court . Then , as now , Mr. Grassley said he had no beef with Judge Garland ’ s qualifications .
The Senate finally confirmed Judge Garland for the appeals court in 1997 , after Mr. Clinton won re-election and resubmitted the nomination .
Judge Garland also met Tuesday with Republican Sens . Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania . At least 17 GOP senators have agreed to meet with the nominee , although only two have called for the Senate to hold confirmation hearings .
The White House released a letter Tuesday from the former presidents of the ABA calling on Senate leaders to hold a vote on the Garland nomination . They emphasized “ the need for the judicial system to function independently of partisan influences ” and said Judge Garland has “ sterling ” credentials .

us_senate,CNN (Web News),0,http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/11/politics/mcconnell-senate-republican-majority/index.html,Mitch McConnell's mission to keep the GOP majority,2016-01-11,Ted Barrett,"Washington ( CNN ) Mitch McConnell is the Senate majority leader -- and he 'd like to keep it that way .
Heading into the final year of his first session leading the chamber -- which begins Monday when the Senate returns from its winter recess -- the Kentucky Republican is developing a carefully tailored legislative agenda . It is designed to support his top priority , which is not losing power to Democrats , who controlled the Senate for most of the past decade and who are committed to reclaiming it in the November elections .
To complicate his effort , the soft-spoken and methodical McConnell must accomplish this against the backdrop of a wildly unpredictable 2016 GOP presidential nominating campaign that has two anti-Washington agitators -- businessman Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas -- leading the pack . The controversial tone of their campaigns has mainstream Republicans deeply concerned about the impact on down-ticket candidates -- such as moderate GOP senators from purple states who must be re-elected if Republicans are to hold the Senate -- especially if Trump or Cruz win the Republican nomination .
Republicans currently have a narrow 54-46 advantage and must defend 24 seats this fall , seven in swing states that voted for President Barack Obama . Democrats need to protect just 10 seats , only one of which is considered competitive .
A constant and challenging task in the months ahead for McConnell will be to protect incumbent senators like Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire , Mark Kirk of Illinois , Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania , Rob Portman of Ohio , and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin from politically difficult votes on free trade , guns , abortion , and other sensitive social issues that could cause them trouble back home .
McConnell , who is firmly rooted in the establishment wing of the GOP , spent his first year running the chamber with a strategic eye toward the 2016 Senate elections . He believes he made an important down payment to voters by proving Republicans can govern more effectively and successfully than Democrats .
`` By any objective standard , I think the Senate is clearly back to work , '' McConnell said at a year-end news conference .
He pushed through a number of major bills -- such as highway funding and education reform -- that were signed into law by Obama and he diligently prevented any real threat of government shutdowns or other dramatic `` fiscal cliffs '' that have shaken voters ' nerves in recent years .
`` I wanted to end those sort of rattling experiences that the American people do n't like . It never produces a positive result anyway , '' McConnell said . `` I took those off the table the day after the election and we began to figure out how to get the Senate working again . ''
McConnell is tight-lipped about exactly which bills he will put on the floor and when ahead of the November election . Aides say many of those decisions need to be made after a joint House and Senate Republican retreat in Baltimore later this week . But he 's made clear that restoring a regular appropriations process -- where all 12 government spending bills will be debated and voted on separately -- is key .
Democrats fought that approach last year because Republicans were demanding higher spending for defense needs than domestic programs , a standoff that led to a breakthrough budget deal that set top-line government spending figures for 2016 and 2017 . Because of that , Democratic leaders believe McConnell 's ambition to take up all the spending bills may be doable .
`` That seems to be pretty fertile ground for bipartisan compromise , '' said Sen. Chuck Schumer ( D-New York ) .
It may be ambitious to believe all these bills can actually pass the partisan Congress , especially with a legislative calendar truncated by the political conventions and other campaign activities . But if the parties could agree on some individual spending bills it would lower the risk of major government shutdown when the new fiscal year begins October 1 . That would be a relief to GOP leaders and a sign to voters they kept their word to avoid calamity .
While there is a laundry list of other bills the Senate could take up this year -- including a massive international trade deal and sweeping criminal justice reform -- McConnell might be reluctant to negotiate anything major with a lame duck Democratic president and hold out to see if a Republican can win back the White House .
`` I think no matter which party controls the White House , during a presidential year everything is overtaken by that election , '' said Brian Walsh , a former top official at the National Republican Senatorial Committee , which works to elect GOP Senate candidates . `` I think both parties are in a wait-and-see mode in terms of who is going to control the White House in the following year . I think it 's only prudent to hold off on big issues like this and see where things are in 12 months . ''
McConnell 's aim for a more modest legislative agenda differs dramatically with the priorities of the new House Speaker Paul Ryan who has said he wants his chamber to be an `` ideas factory . ''
Ryan also must placate a restive right flank that wants to push high-profile legislation that will draw sharp campaign year contrasts with Obama and congressional Democrats . Some of those hot-button issues -- dealing with abortion , guns , climate change and more -- will be politically complicated for McConnell if they are sent over from the House just as he is trying to protect swing state senators from tough votes .
Other issues will compete for McConnell 's attention . Many Republicans want to pass an Authorization for the Use of Military Force against ISIS , something that has regularly stalled in the past over policy differences . Ryan has approved a fresh look at an AUMF and if the House approves one if could put pressure on McConnell to act .
The House is also readying to act on new sanctions against North Korea .
On the domestic front , a battle is expected on a bill reauthorizing the Federal Aviation Administration over a push by some Republicans to privatize air traffic controllers .
Democrats will demand votes on their agenda too . Helping Puerto Rico solve its debt crisis is a top priority for Democrats as is passing more gun control laws . Republicans leaders have signaled they are open to possible legislation for the troubled U.S. territory but are flatly opposed to any new gun law , despite Obama 's recent push on the issue .
`` We 're going to do more on guns , '' said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid . `` We 're not going to be silent on that . ''
McConnell has already signaled he does n't want to take up the Trans-Pacific Partnership measure — a legacy item for Obama — until after the election . Putting off votes on the controversial multi-nation free trade pact could benefit GOP senators up for re-election in rust belt states like Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Rob Portman of Ohio where the loss of jobs to free trade deals is a sensitive subject .
McConnell also has said he does n't intend to draft a major overhaul of the tax code this year , even though it 's a top goal of Ryan 's .
Because government funding levels were set in last year 's budget deal , McConnell could skip doing a budget resolution this year , several congressional aides told CNN . Dropping the time-consuming budget process could give GOP Senate candidates more time at home campaigning . It would also allow them to avoid the ritual `` vote-a-rama '' when senators can offer up an infinite number of amendments , many of which are aimed at putting political squeezes on those running for re-election .
Walsh , who as an official at the NRSC helped Republicans win back the Senate two years ago after eight years of Democratic majorities , said the key for McConnell and his conference is `` demonstrating that they are doing the business of the American people in terms of funding the government , passing bills on time . And that will benefit their candidates . ''
`` I think the big issue is do no harm , '' he said .","Washington (CNN) Mitch McConnell is the Senate majority leader -- and he'd like to keep it that way.

Democrats will demand votes on their agenda too. Helping Puerto Rico solve its debt crisis is a top priority for Democrats as is passing more gun control laws. Republicans leaders have signaled they are open to possible legislation for the troubled U.S. territory but are flatly opposed to any new gun law, despite Obama's recent push on the issue.

""We're going to do more on guns,"" said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid. ""We're not going to be silent on that.""

'Do no harm' to GOP senators?

McConnell has already signaled he doesn't want to take up the Trans-Pacific Partnership measure — a legacy item for Obama — until after the election. Putting off votes on the controversial multi-nation free trade pact could benefit GOP senators up for re-election in rust belt states like Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Rob Portman of Ohio where the loss of jobs to free trade deals is a sensitive subject.

McConnell also has said he doesn't intend to draft a major overhaul of the tax code this year, even though it's a top goal of Ryan's.

Because government funding levels were set in last year's budget deal, McConnell could skip doing a budget resolution this year, several congressional aides told CNN. Dropping the time-consuming budget process could give GOP Senate candidates more time at home campaigning. It would also allow them to avoid the ritual ""vote-a-rama"" when senators can offer up an infinite number of amendments, many of which are aimed at putting political squeezes on those running for re-election.

A spokesman for McConnell denied that was true.

""We're planning on a budget,"" Don Stewart said.

Walsh, who as an official at the NRSC helped Republicans win back the Senate two years ago after eight years of Democratic majorities, said the key for McConnell and his conference is ""demonstrating that they are doing the business of the American people in terms of funding the government, passing bills on time. And that will benefit their candidates.""

""I think the big issue is do no harm,"" he said.",www.cnn.com,left,XMMMEthPNC2CjU6F

We implemented new standards for low-emission vehicles and expanded Colorado ’ s renewable energy standard , doubling the goal for rural electric producers . We also built public support for unprecedented expansions of light rail and the retrofitting of buildings to save energy . At the same time , we created more than 10,000 clean-energy jobs — just as we can create millions of clean-energy jobs across the country if we take the right steps. ” John Hickenlooper , Washington Post
Senator Doug Jones ( D-AL ) writes , “ This week , the Senate voted on one idea : the Green New Deal . Unfortunately , it was too broad and went too far . It tried to address such a diverse set of problems facing our country —climate change , lack of access to health care , and stagnant wages , for example —that it was not practical and collapsed under its own weight . I voted against it for this reason… “ Our leaders and the media spend too much time bickering about unrealistic ideas and not enough time talking about real steps we can take to protect our environment and grow our economy . While the Green New Deal is not a feasible way to move forward , I hope we can come together at every level of government and industry and find a path forward to secure our future. ” Sen. Doug Jones , al.com
Some note that “ Tuesday ’ s Senate vote rejecting the Green New Deal masks a striking reality : In a matter of months , liberal activists have upended the conversation about climate change among both parties in Washington … even as Republicans seek to exploit that divide , many GOP lawmakers are offering climate solutions of their own . And few besides President Donald Trump still dispute that the changing climate is a problem. ” Zack Colman and Anthony Adragna , Politico
“ McConnell tried to rush the # GreenNewDeal straight to the floor without a hearing . The real question we should be asking : Why does the Senate GOP refuse to hold any major hearings on climate change ? ” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ( D-NY ) , Twitter
“ During floor debate ahead of a vote on the Green New Deal , Sen. Mike Lee ( R-Utah ) told his colleagues that if they really want to address environmental concerns they ’ ll encourage people to couple off and have more babies… This recommendation , to add more people to the planet , doesn ’ t track with science or reason . A 2017 research article determined that one way an individual could contribute to eliminating greenhouse gases is to have one fewer child . '' Colby Itkowitz , Washington Post
Fortunately , “ the ploy fell flat . Most Democrats agreed ahead of time to go with a noncommittal vote of ‘ present , ’ thus denying Mr. McConnell his desired drama and any meaningful vote count… The Green New Deal is by no means a fully baked proposal for combating climate change . But for all its flaws , it is a more promising first step than the Republican leaders ’ chosen strategy of inaction and sneering denial. ” Michelle Cottle , The New York Times
“ McConnell wanted to put moderate Senate Democrats on the spot by making them publicly vote yes or no on the resolution . It ’ s a way to sow chaos in the party and create fodder for political ads ahead of 2020 Senate elections. ” Li Zhou and Ella Nilsen , Vox

“ If the measure is simply a resolution laying out goals , why can ’ t all members of the Senate say whether or not they support the goals now , as Markey , Ocasio-Cortez , and the Senate Democrats running for president had done when the Green New Deal was first introduced ? ‘ We haven ’ t had any witnesses or expertise or science , ’ Markey replied… But if further study is required before senators should be expected to take a stand on whether the goal makes sense , then the decision by Markey and Ocasio-Cortez to establish those goals in February doesn ’ t make sense . ”
“ Only in Congress could a political party introduce legislation with great media fanfare , then vote against it and blame the other side for cynicism… The real stunt is the Green New Deal . Democrats want to be seen as doing something about climate change without being accountable for the cost of their ideas . The Green New Deal proposes explicitly to retrofit every house in America and eliminate fossil fuels within a decade . That would mean higher energy costs , much higher taxes , and lower living standards for every American . ”
“ Every Democratic senator running for president has publicly stated his or her support for the Green New Deal , and , in fact , all of them have even signed on to Markey ’ s legislation as a cosponsor . Yet not one of them voted in favor of the measure this afternoon… the men and women who wish to be our next president should have the political courage either to vote for the proposals they say they support or to publicly oppose the policies for which they refuse to vote . ”
“ They 're willing enough to say the Green New Deal needs to happen , not willing enough to vote to advance it , but also not willing enough to say ‘ no ’ to it . True profiles in courage… One obvious takeaway from the vote is that the overwhelming majority of Senate Democrats are interested in combating climate change so long as it doesn ’ t actually involve anything more than talking . ”
Many argue that “ if Democrats cared about global warming as anything more than a political issue , they would not be wasting time with useless and impractical proposals like this one . Instead , they would start by creating policies more conducive to fracking for natural gas in the short run . This technology has done more in 10 years to reduce American carbon emissions than all the efforts of all environmental activists in history combined… Beyond that , Democrats who fear a warming planet should endorse and legislate toward the long-term expansion of nuclear energy , which safely and effectively freed France from its carbon footprint long ago . ”
“ With nuclear power available , the Green New Deal 's strategy for fighting climate change with windmills makes as much sense as going to war in sailboats… [ Instead ] I propose this response to climate change : the United States should launch a New Manhattan Project for Clean Energy , a five-year project to meet Ten Grand Challenges that will use American research and technology to put our country and the world firmly on a path toward cleaner , cheaper energy… American innovation is the answer . According to the Global Carbon Project , over the last 13 years , the United States has reduced production of greenhouse gases more than any major country – largely thanks to conservation and switching from coal to natural gas for electricity. ” Sen. Lamar Alexander ( R-TN ) , Fox News
