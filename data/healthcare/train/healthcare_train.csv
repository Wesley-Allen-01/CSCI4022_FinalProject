Mitt Romney ’ s health care plan wouldn ’ t just insure fewer people than “ Obamacare ” — it would make the uninsured problem worse than it would have been if the law had never passed , according to a comparison of the two plans by a research group with a history of pro- “ Obamacare ” studies .
The analysis by the Commonwealth Fund , a New York-based health care research foundation , found that under Romney ’ s health care plan , the uninsured population would soar to 72 million by 2022 — 12 million higher than if nothing had been done at all .
By contrast , if President Barack Obama ’ s health care law is fully implemented — including complete state participation in the now voluntary Medicaid expansion — the number of uninsured people would drop from 47.9 million in 2011 to about 27.1 million people in 2022 , the report estimated .
The Commonwealth Fund produces studies that often cast the national health care law in a favorable light , and spotlight the shortcomings of the American health care system compared to other countries .
The number of insured Americans would rise in every age group under the Affordable Care Act and fall in every group under Romney ’ s plan , Sara Collins , vice president for Commonwealth ’ s affordable health insurance program , told reporters in a conference call Monday .
The report says most of the difference is due to Romney ’ s plans for Medicaid , which he would turn into block grants , and the expansion of Medicaid that ’ s planned under the ACA . The gap between those two proposals accounts for about 80 percent of the difference in their impact on the uninsured , according to the analysis .
The Commonwealth Fund report is based on research by MIT economist Jonathan Gruber , who worked on both the federal and Massachusetts health reform laws , and is the latest dire forecast from ACA sympathizers about health care under a Romney administration .
The Romney campaign said the “ flawed report ” misstates Romney ’ s proposals and depicts “ a fantasy world where Obamacare has been a success . ”
“ Under ObamaCare , Americans have seen their insurance premiums increase , small businesses are facing massive tax increases , and seniors will have reduced access to Medicare services , ” Ryan Williams , a Romney spokesman , wrote in an email to ███ . “ The American people did not want this law , our country can not afford this law , and when Mitt Romney becomes president he will repeal it and replace it with common-sense , patient-centered reforms that strengthen our health care system . ”
CORRECTION : Corrected by : Vivyan Tran @ 10/02/2012 03:20 PM CORRECTION : This story has been updated to correct the report ’ s assumption of the growth rate in Romney ’ s Medicaid block grant proposal , which was described incorrectly in the Commonwealth Fund ’ s own report . The group ’ s estimate assumed that the block grants would grow at the rate of the Consumer Price Index plus 1 percent .","A research group found that Romney's plan would be worse than doing nothing. Study: 72M uninsured under Mitt plan

Mitt Romney’s health care plan wouldn’t just insure fewer people than “Obamacare” — it would make the uninsured problem worse than it would have been if the law had never passed, according to a comparison of the two plans by a research group with a history of pro-“Obamacare” studies.

The Commonwealth Fund produces studies that often cast the national health care law in a favorable light, and spotlight the shortcomings of the American health care system compared to other countries.

The number of insured Americans would rise in every age group under the Affordable Care Act and fall in every group under Romney’s plan, Sara Collins, vice president for Commonwealth’s affordable health insurance program, told reporters in a conference call Monday.

The report says most of the difference is due to Romney’s plans for Medicaid, which he would turn into block grants, and the expansion of Medicaid that’s planned under the ACA. The gap between those two proposals accounts for about 80 percent of the difference in their impact on the uninsured, according to the analysis.

The Commonwealth Fund report is based on research by MIT economist Jonathan Gruber, who worked on both the federal and Massachusetts health reform laws, and is the latest dire forecast from ACA sympathizers about health care under a Romney administration.

The Romney campaign said the “flawed report” misstates Romney’s proposals and depicts “a fantasy world where Obamacare has been a success.”

“Under ObamaCare, Americans have seen their insurance premiums increase, small businesses are facing massive tax increases, and seniors will have reduced access to Medicare services,” Ryan Williams, a Romney spokesman, wrote in an email to POLITICO. “The American people did not want this law, our country cannot afford this law, and when Mitt Romney becomes president he will repeal it and replace it with common-sense, patient-centered reforms that strengthen our health care system.”

CORRECTION: Corrected by: Vivyan Tran @ 10/02/2012 03:20 PM CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct the report’s assumption of the growth rate in Romney’s Medicaid block grant proposal, which was described incorrectly in the Commonwealth Fund’s own report.

Got questions about the GOP plan to overhaul federal health law? Join us on Twitter Thursday 12-1 p.m. ET for our #ACAchat. Kaiser's Julie Rovner, NPR's Alison Kodjak and health policy analysts of various political persuasions will be online discussing how the Republican plan could work, who wins and who loses. See you there!

After literally years of promises, House Republicans have a bill they say will ""repeal and replace"" the Affordable Care Act.

Some conservative Republicans have derided the new proposal — the American Health Care Act — calling it ""Obamacare Lite."" It keeps intact some of the more popular features of the ACA, such as allowing adult children to stay on their parents' health plans to age 26 and, at least in theory, ensuring that people with pre-existing conditions will still have access to insurance.

In some cases the elements of the law that remain are due to political popularity. In others, it's because the special budget rules Congress is using so Republicans can avoid a Senate filibuster do not allow them to repeal the entire law.

But there are some major changes in how people would choose and pay for health care and insurance. Here are some of the biggest.

Tax credits to help buy insurance

Both the GOP bill and the ACA provide tax credits to help some people pay their premiums if they don't get insurance through work or government programs. And in both, the credits are refundable (meaning people who owe no taxes still get the money) and advanceable (so people don't have to wait until they file their taxes to get them). But the GOP's tax credits would work very differently from those already in place.

Under current law, the amount of the credit is tied to a person's income (the less you earn the more you get) and the cost of insurance where you live.

The GOP tax credits would be tied largely to age, with older people getting twice as much ($4,000 per year) as younger people ($2,000). But the Republican plan would also let insurers charge those older adults five times as much as younger adults, so even a credit twice as big might not make up the difference in premiums.

The GOP credits also do not vary by location, so they would be worth more in places where health care and health insurance are less expensive.

The GOP credits do phase out gradually, starting with incomes above $75,000 for an individual and $150,000 for families.

Medicaid

The biggest changes the Republican bill would make are to the Medicaid program. Starting in 2020, it would roll back federal funding for the ACA's expansion that allowed states to provide Medicaid coverage to all low-income individuals under 138 percent of the poverty level, rather than just the specific categories of poor people (children, pregnant women, elderly, disabled) who were previously eligible.

Thirty-one states opted to expand access to Medicaid. People who are covered under the expansion would continue to be funded by the federal government after that, but states would no longer be allowed to enroll anyone under those expanded criteria. And an enrollee who loses eligibility for the expansion program could not re-enroll.

But the bill would go further as well, making changes to the underlying Medicaid program that House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden, R-Ore., described as ""the biggest entitlement reform in the last 20 years.""

Currently, Medicaid costs are shared between states and the federal government, but the funding is open-ended, so the federal government pays its percentage of whatever states spend. Under the proposed bill, the amount of federal funding would be capped on a per-person basis, so funding would go up as more people qualify. But that per-capita amount might not grow as fast as Medicaid costs, which could leave states on the hook for an ever-increasing share of the costs of the program.

""Capping federal contributions to the Medicaid program will likely force states with already tight budgets to limit eligibility and cut benefits to at-risk Americans,"" said the American Public Health Association in a statement.

Help for wealthier people

If you earn a lot of money, or even just enough to put aside something extra for health expenses, the GOP bill will provide a lot to like.

First, it would repeal almost all of the taxes that were increased by the ACA to pay for the expansion of health coverage. Those include higher Medicare taxes for high-income earners, a tax on investment income and various taxes on health care providers, including insurance companies, makers of medical devices and even tanning salons.

The bill would also provide new tax advantages for those who can afford to save, including allowing more money to be deposited into health savings accounts, and lower penalties for those who use those accounts to pay for nonmedical needs.

In addition, the plan would lower the threshold for deducting medical expenses on income taxes and allow people with job-based tax-preferred ""flexible spending accounts"" to put away more pretax money. It would also restore over-the-counter drugs as eligible for reimbursement from those accounts.

Mandates to buy or provide coverage

The GOP plan doesn't actually repeal the requirements for individuals to have coverage or for employers to provide it. That's because it can't under budget rules. Instead, the bill would reduce the penalties in both cases to zero, rendering the requirements moot.

The individual requirement was used by the health law to force healthy people into buying coverage to help improve insurers' risk pools since they could no longer bar customers with pre-existing conditions.

Instead, the Republican plan would provide a penalty for those who do not maintain ""continuous coverage."" Those with a break in insurance coverage of more than 63 days could still purchase insurance without regard to pre-existing health conditions, but they would be required to pay premiums that are 30 percent higher for 12 months.

The employer ""mandate,"" which requires firms with 50 or more workers to offer coverage or pay a fine, has actually had relatively little impact on insurance coverage, analysts have concluded, and probably is not necessary to prevent employers from dropping coverage. In both the ACA and the GOP bill, however, workers whose employers offer coverage could not decline that coverage and get a tax credit instead.

How to pay for it

With all the taxes and fees stripped from the ACA, how will Republicans pay for their tax credits? The answer is not clear.

""We are still discussing details, but we are committed to repealing Obamacare and replacing it with fiscally responsible policies that restore the free market and protect taxpayers,"" said the Republican fact sheet that accompanied the release of the bill.

Also still missing is an estimate from the Congressional Budget Office that will detail not only how much the proposal will cost, but also how many people would gain or lose health insurance. Republicans insist that estimate will be available before the full House votes on the bill.

The nation ’ s president , Thabo Mbeki , was apparently fooled by posts on Western Internet websites that disputed whether HIV caused AIDS , and he ordered that the country ’ s physicians stop administering antiretroviral drugs to citizens afflicted with HIV , which was almost 1 in 10 at the time . President Mbeki aggressively defended his actions , claiming that AIDS in Africa was primarily a heterosexual paradox . He insisted that the disease was `` a uniquely African catastrophe , '' and said that conventional medicine from the West was an `` absurd and illogical '' solution to the country ’ s health crisis .
Mbeki deferred to a group of dissident—and thoroughly discredited—academics and naysayers in the U.S. With AIDS predicted to decimate a full 25 % of South Africa 's population by the year 2010 , Mbeki pinned all South Africa ’ s hopes on containing the disease on the advice of a controversial molecular biologist , Peter Duesberg , who claimed HIV was relatively harmless and that AIDS was caused more by poverty-related conditions such as undernourishment than by unprotected sex . So , instead of administering the cocktail of HIV medications known to be effective , Mbeki had his health minister contrive alternative remedies for AIDS , including beetroot and garlic .
The results were devastating for South Africa . More than 330,000 people died prematurely from the disease between 2000 and 2005 due to Mbeki ’ s AIDS denialism , and at least 35,000 babies were born with HIV , infections that could have been prevented using conventional medicine , according to a study by the Harvard School of Public Health .
While there is no direct institutional denialism of conventional medicine here in the U.S. , the denialist movement is active and spreading nonetheless . Vaccine denialism—especially in states with lax public-health laws—has already shown to have a negative effect on public health in some regional pockets , and it ’ s leaving those communities open to outbreaks of diseases that had been all but eradicated , including measles , polio , whooping cough ( pertussis ) , and even smallpox .
In 2013 , researchers confirmed that a 2010 whooping cough outbreak in California—the worst in the U.S. in more than 50 years—was spread primarily by the children of parents who received non-medical exemptions for school vaccinations from the state . The study showed that the outbreak was found exclusively in clusters where children were not vaccinated . There were more than 9,000 cases of the disease in California in 2010 and 10 deaths . In San Diego County , where there were about 5,000 immunization exemptions , there were 980 cases of whooping cough .
Meanwhile , some states were slashing programs for children 's vaccinations . In 2011 , the year after the whooping cough outbreak in California , Florida Republican Gov . Rick Scott cut a state program that provided whooping couch vaccines for poor mothers of babies too young to get their first whooping cough vaccines . There has since been a whooping cough outbreak in Florida with a six-week-old boy dying from the disease .
These whooping cough outbreaks have been followed by a measles outbreak that began in Texas this year , which is now spreading throughout the U.S . Measles had also been declared eliminated , but in recent years it has appeared in areas with low-vaccination rates . The original Texas outbreak affected 21 children who attended the Eagle Mountain International Church in northern Texas , a congregation skeptical of vaccines . The outbreak began after an un-​immunized man visited Indonesia and then the church , which is part of the Kenneth Copeland ministries . None of the children affected had been vaccinated .
`` This is a good example , unfortunately , of how birds of a feather flock together , '' Jason Terk , an infectious disease specialist recently told NPR . `` If you have individuals who are vaccine-hesitant or vaccine-hostile , they congregate together , and that creates its own unique situation where a population of individuals is susceptible to getting the very disease that they decided they do n't want to protect themselves from . ''
Overall , measles has infected nearly​ 600 ​people ​in 18 localized breakouts across 21 states in the U.S. this year . And despite more than 90 % of the U.S. population being immunized against measles , this is the worst measles outbreak in decades , according to the Centers for Disease Control . Nearly three times the number of people have been infected through the end of August than were infected in all 2013 .
So far , there are no reported deaths from measles in the U.S. this year , but researchers say it ’ s all a numbers game . Between one and two of every 1,000 cases of measles are fatal , according to the CDC .
One of the scariest facets of vaccine denialism ​are those who claim they ’ re “ not anti-vaccine , but pro-safe vaccine. ” Thus , they validate themselves as responsible and immunize themselves ( pardon the pun ) from criticism once outbreaks of measles and whooping cough occur . Thus , those who choose to delay vaccinations or not stick by the prescribed schedule can deny culpability . But their apprehension and ambiguity — whether denialism or not — feeds the doubt that keeps other parents from immunizing their children . And any rhetoric against vaccinations can have a negative impact .
Take the Taliban-occupied areas of Pakistan and Afghanistan , regions where children are being kept from critical vaccinations . This tragedy has nothing to do with denial , but instead anger with the U.S . Leaders of the radical Islamic sect have attacked healthcare workers , killing 61 of them and their escorts in the past two years , and have banned the dispersal of the polio vaccine after they discovered a fake vaccination campaign was used to hunt down Osama bin Laden through his family ’ s DNA several years ago .
The results of the Taliban ’ s quasi-institutional embargo on vaccinations have been devastating . Last week , Pakistan reported another 11 new cases of polio , bringing this year ’ s total to 138 , compared with 34 cases of the crippling disease from just a year earlier .
Once nearly extinct , polio ’ s comeback in the Middle East and northern Africa has elicited a declaration of a global health emergency from the World Health Organization , which has asked these and other countries to ensure their residents are vaccinated before they travel abroad .
Can polio make a comeback in the US ? Researchers in Europe are saying that the disease can make a comeback there as regional conflicts are undermining a $ 10 billion immunization campaign . They ’ re also concerned about polio ’ s recent reemergence in war-torn Syria , and the possibility that ​unimmunized refugees who carry the virus may flee to European countries that have been polio-free for decades.​​
Earlier this year , Penn State ’ s Department of Biochemistry warned that national and global events could combine into some reemergence of polio here , but only for communities that don ’ t immunize , like the​ 2005 breakout in a Minnesota Amish community . But for the general U.S. population , there ’ s little risk of polio flaring up , as is happening overseas .
But even as vaccination rates are high in the U.S. , the anti-vaccine movement is growing in some states , aided by permissive religious and personal exemptions allowed by state laws . Paul Offit , the noted pediatrician and vaccine advocate , notes that states like Idaho , Michigan , Oregon and Vermont have rates of un​vaccinated kindergartners that are four times the national average . These states could become potential hotspots for infectious diseases , especially in more vaccine-wary communities .
But it ’ s not only the children whose parents choose not to vaccinate or to delay vaccination that are at risk . Also defenseless are infants and toddlers too young to have their vaccinations , children with immunodeficiencies , and people who , for medical reasons , ca n't be vaccinated and rely on “ herd immunity ” from others ' vaccinations to keep them protected . So , the denialism of parents who chose not to vaccinate can harm or even kill the small children of parents with every intention of abiding by the vaccination schedule .
`` People assume this will never happen to them until it happens to them , '' Offit told USA Today in April . `` ​I​t 's a shame that 's the way we have to learn the lesson . There 's a human price for that lesson . `` ​​","Nearly 15 years ago, the unspeakable happened in AIDS-ravaged South Africa.

This tragedy has nothing to do with denial, but instead anger with the U.S. Leaders of the radical Islamic sect have attacked healthcare workers, killing 61 of them and their escorts in the past two years, and have banned the dispersal of the polio vaccine after they discovered a fake vaccination campaign was used to hunt down Osama bin Laden through his family’s DNA several years ago.

The results of the Taliban’s quasi-institutional embargo on vaccinations have been devastating. Last week, Pakistan reported another 11 new cases of polio, bringing this year’s total to 138, compared with 34 cases of the crippling disease from just a year earlier.

Once nearly extinct, polio’s comeback in the Middle East and northern Africa has elicited a declaration of a global health emergency from the World Health Organization, which has asked these and other countries to ensure their residents are vaccinated before they travel abroad.

Can polio make a comeback in the US? Researchers in Europe are saying that the disease can make a comeback there as regional conflicts are undermining a $10 billion immunization campaign. They’re also concerned about polio’s recent reemergence in war-torn Syria, and the possibility that ​unimmunized refugees who carry the virus may flee to European countries that have been polio-free for decades.​​

Earlier this year, Penn State’s Department of Biochemistry warned that national and global events could combine into some reemergence of polio here, but only for communities that don’t immunize, like the​ 2005 breakout in a Minnesota Amish community. But for the general U.S. population, there’s little risk of polio flaring up, as is happening overseas.

But even as vaccination rates are high in the U.S., the anti-vaccine movement is growing in some states, aided by permissive religious and personal exemptions allowed by state laws. Paul Offit, the noted pediatrician and vaccine advocate, notes that states like Idaho, Michigan, Oregon and Vermont have rates of un​vaccinated kindergartners that are four times the national average. These states could become potential hotspots for infectious diseases, especially in more vaccine-wary communities.

But it’s not only the children whose parents choose not to vaccinate or to delay vaccination that are at risk. Also defenseless are infants and toddlers too young to have their vaccinations, children with immunodeficiencies, and people who, for medical reasons, can't be vaccinated and rely on “ herd immunity” from others' vaccinations to keep them protected. So, the denialism of parents who chose not to vaccinate can harm or even kill the small children of parents with every intention of abiding by the vaccination schedule.

""People assume this will never happen to them until it happens to them,"" Offit told USA Today in April. ""​I​t's a shame that's the way we have to learn the lesson. There's a human price for that lesson.""​​",www.salon.com,left,LwYRBnrjvRzpqwOs

Burwell case , U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said on Wednesday .
The proposal , offered by Republican Senator Ron Johnson and has 31 Republican co-sponsors , would extend the insurance subsidies until August 2017 . But Burwell said the measure would also take away the subsidies over time and repeal important components of Obamacare such as guaranteeing insurance for Americans with pre-existing health conditions .
Burwell said Wednesday Congress and the states would have to fix the Affordable Care Act if the Supreme Court disallows the subsidies for purchasing insurance . `` If the court makes that decision , we 're going to do everything we can , '' Burwell told the House Ways and Means Committee . But , she added , `` The critical decisions ... will sit with the Congress , and states and governors to determine if those subsidies are available . ''
Burwell testified Wednesday before the GOP-led House Ways and Means Committee as Obama 's five-year-old health overhaul remains a partisan flashpoint likely to reverberate through next year 's presidential and congressional elections .
According to excerpts of her opening remarks , Burwell lauded the health care law for `` our historic progress in reducing the number of uninsured and improving coverage for families who already had insurance . ''
Burwell 's appearance comes with a Supreme Court decision expected this month on whether subsidies that millions of Americans are receiving under the law are legal . It also comes as health insurers in many states have proposed double-digit rate increases for next year — which Republicans cite as evidence of the law 's failures .
`` It 's a pocketbook issue for families , for small businesses , '' said Rep. Erik Paulsen , R-Minn. , a Ways and Means member . `` There are better answers . ''
In a speech Tuesday , Obama mocked `` unending Chicken Little warnings '' from opponents who warned that the law would abridge people 's freedom .
`` There 's something , I have to say , just deeply cynical about the ceaseless , endless partisan attempts to roll back progress , '' Obama said at the Catholic Hospital Association conference .
In his prepared remarks , Rep. Sander Levin of Michigan , top Democrat on Ways and Means , said , `` The predictions of doom and gloom from the other side have certainly not come to pass . No rationing , no destroying Medicare , no bankruptcy . ''
Conservatives who brought the Supreme Court case contend that the health overhaul allowed subsidies only for people in states that created their own insurance marketplaces , not those using the federal HealthCare.gov website . More than 30 states use the federal website and millions of their residents could lose subsidies — which they receive as tax credits — and be forced to drop health coverage they 'd find too expensive .
A victory by the conservatives could put disproportionate political pressure on Republicans to help those who 've lost subsidies . Of the 34 states likeliest to be most affected by such a ruling , 26 have GOP governors . And 22 of the 24 GOP senators up for re-election next year are from those same states .
Top House and Senate Republicans have been working privately toward legislation restoring aid to those losing it until sometime in 2017 . It would also eliminate parts of the health overhaul , such as its requirement that companies insure workers . That would almost certainly draw a veto from Obama .
Republican lawmakers say they will unveil their plan once the justices rule , though there are no indications they have united behind a particular plan . They hope a Republican will inhabit the White House in 2017 so they can repeal the current law and enact one less expansive .
According to the most recent figures from Burwell 's agency , 10.2 million people nationally have obtained insurance coverage under the health law from state and federal marketplaces and started paying for it .
Of those , 7.3 million are from the 34 states most likely to lose subsidies if the plaintiffs win at the Supreme Court . About 88 percent of them — 6.4 million — receive federal subsidies averaging $ 272 monthly .

healthcare,Guest Writer - Right,2,http://reason.com/archives/2017/09/17/sanders-medicare-for-all-delusion,Sanders' Medicare for All Delusion,2017-09-17,"Steve Chapman, Charles Oliver, Peter Bagge, Josh Blackman, Eric Boehm, Zuri Davis, Ilya Somin, Elizabeth Nolan Brown, Jacob Sullum, Shikha Dalmia","Bernie Sanders has a health care plan he calls Medicare for all . He 's underselling it . His proposal really should be called Medicare for all and a pony . It 's everything you could want and then some .
Medicare is a giant government program that pays for health care for seniors and the disabled . Its costs are mushrooming . Over the next 10 years , outlays are expected to grow by nearly a third as a share of the economy ; over the next 30 years , those costs are expected to double .
Revenues , however , will lag . The Medicare trust fund is on pace to run out of money by 2029 .
It 's not clear that we as a country can afford Medicare as it currently exists . Merely preserving it without significant cuts would eventually require a tax increase that working people would resent . But instead of looking for ways to economize , the Vermont senator wants to expand the program in a way that the term `` vast '' barely begins to capture .
His majestic vision goes beyond merely including the entire U.S. population in Medicare—which would increase the number of recipients by sixfold in just four years . Sanders wants to add coverage for dental , vision and hearing needs , which the program now excludes . And he promises `` no more copays , no more deductibles and no more fighting with insurance companies when they fail to pay for charges . ''
He 's talking about a huge change . As a study by the Kaiser Family Foundation noted , `` Medicare has relatively high cost-sharing requirements for covered benefits and , unlike typical large employer plans , traditional Medicare does not limit beneficiaries ' annual out-of-pocket spending . '' In 2010 , it found , the average recipient paid $ 2,746 for deductibles , coinsurance and the like ( not counting premiums ) .
Under Sanders ' proposal , the government would pay all those expenses—not for 55 million people but for 325 million . Actually , it would pay all those expenses plus a lot of new ones , because relieving patients of any financial obligation would induce more people to get more care . If you reduce the price of a good to zero , the demand for it will rise—usually by a lot .
American advocates of single-payer health insurance love the Canadian system . But Sanders apparently finds it wanting . His plan would provide even more benefits than Canada 's .
Democrats recently saved their Obamacare from the certain death it faced a few months earlier . The Affordable Care Act , once unpopular , gained broad support because Americans came to see it for what it is : an incremental and fiscally restrained method of expanding the number of people with decent coverage with minimal disruption .
The failed Republican effort to repeal and replace it holds useful lessons . One is the importance of caution . Americans distrust any ambitious change in the realm of medical care . They fear being deprived of something they have and value , and they stand ready to punish the culprits .

And bad policy , ultimately , is bad politics .","Bernie Sanders has a health care plan he calls Medicare for all. He's underselling it. His proposal really should be called Medicare for all and a pony. It's everything you could want and then some.

Medicare is a giant government program that pays for health care for seniors and the disabled. Its costs are mushrooming. Over the next 10 years, outlays are expected to grow by nearly a third as a share of the economy; over the next 30 years, those costs are expected to double.

Revenues, however, will lag. The Medicare trust fund is on pace to run out of money by 2029.

It's not clear that we as a country can afford Medicare as it currently exists. Merely preserving it without significant cuts would eventually require a tax increase that working people would resent. But instead of looking for ways to economize, the Vermont senator wants to expand the program in a way that the term ""vast"" barely begins to capture.

His majestic vision goes beyond merely including the entire U.S. population in Medicare—which would increase the number of recipients by sixfold in just four years. Sanders wants to add coverage for dental, vision and hearing needs, which the program now excludes. And he promises ""no more copays, no more deductibles and no more fighting with insurance companies when they fail to pay for charges.""

He's talking about a huge change. As a study by the Kaiser Family Foundation noted, ""Medicare has relatively high cost-sharing requirements for covered benefits and, unlike typical large employer plans, traditional Medicare does not limit beneficiaries' annual out-of-pocket spending."" In 2010, it found, the average recipient paid $2,746 for deductibles, coinsurance and the like (not counting premiums).

Under Sanders' proposal, the government would pay all those expenses—not for 55 million people but for 325 million. Actually, it would pay all those expenses plus a lot of new ones, because relieving patients of any financial obligation would induce more people to get more care. If you reduce the price of a good to zero, the demand for it will rise—usually by a lot.

American advocates of single-payer health insurance love the Canadian system. But Sanders apparently finds it wanting. His plan would provide even more benefits than Canada's.

Democrats recently saved their Obamacare from the certain death it faced a few months earlier. The Affordable Care Act, once unpopular, gained broad support because Americans came to see it for what it is: an incremental and fiscally restrained method of expanding the number of people with decent coverage with minimal disruption.

The failed Republican effort to repeal and replace it holds useful lessons. One is the importance of caution. Americans distrust any ambitious change in the realm of medical care. They fear being deprived of something they have and value, and they stand ready to punish the culprits.

Another is the danger of overpromising. Republicans in Congress led us to believe they could deliver lower premiums with no individual mandate and without reducing the number of people covered. When it became clear they couldn't deliver, public opinion rebelled. Slogans are easy, but when it comes to health insurance, substance is hard—very hard.

Democrats have an understandable attraction to a single-payer health care system. It's conceptually simple; it's universal; and it builds on a program that is popular with those it covers. But all this is a siren call that would lead them straight to the rocks.

Americans might love what Sanders offers in the way of more benefits for more people. What they would hate is paying for it. One notable shortcoming of the plan he unveiled is that it has no price tag.

Would you like a fabulous meal? Of course. Would you order it without knowing what it costs? No.

The upshot of the ACA's survival is that Democrats are free to take credit for its benefits while blaming President Donald Trump and Congress for its shortcomings. They can press for small improvements at no political risk. If they decide to embrace Medicare for all, though, they may win votes in the short run while inviting failure in the long run.

What we should have learned from the health insurance debates of the past 25 years is that good politics often makes for bad policy. And bad policy, ultimately, is bad politics.

Republicans weren ’ t able to repeal Obamacare in Congress . Now the Trump administration appears to be settling for the second-best thing : weakening Obamacare ’ s insurance regulations , changes that will hurt Americans who are older and sicker while benefiting the young and the healthy .
The Health and Human Services Department published new rules Tuesday that widen access to “ short-term ” health plans , a small subset of insurance products that are meant to cover short gaps in insurance coverage . The Obama administration aggressively regulated these plans , allowing insurance companies to sell them only as 90-day options .
The Trump changes allow insurance companies to sell the skimpier plans for a year , encouraging many more people to buy them and use them as a more regular source of coverage . Officials are also considering allowing insurance companies to extend them further .
These plans are likely to attract young and healthy consumers , leaving behind a pool of older and sicker patients in the Obamacare markets and driving up the prices there .
“ This all looks a lot like the landscape in 2013 [ before the Affordable Care Act took effect ] , ” said David Anderson , a research associate at the Margolis Center for Health Policy at Duke University whose work focuses on health insurance design .
Already in recent weeks , the Trump administration has shown little interest in enforcing Obamacare ’ s guarantee that healthy and sick people get access to the same type of health insurance .
For example , it hasn ’ t intervened in Idaho , where regulators recently told insurers they can simply disregard many of the Affordable Care Act rules and sell new “ freedom plans ” that discriminate against sicker enrollees .
Typically , you ’ d expect the federal government to get involved — to step in and enforce federal law when a state refuses . But when pressed by a reporter on this issue Tuesday , HHS Secretary Alex Azar demurred .
“ I ’ m not in a position to rule on something I ’ ve seen a media report about , ” he said , adding that he doesn ’ t “ believe in premature opinions on complex topics . ”
The Trump administration wants to widen access to plans that deny coverage for preexisting conditions and discriminate against women
The rules the Trump administration rolled out Tuesday relate to “ short-term ” health plans , coverage that is meant to fill gaps between more permanent policies ( for someone who takes a few months off between jobs , for example ) .
Short-term coverage is allowed to skirt several of the health care law ’ s core provisions : Plans can deny people insurance based on their medical history , charge them higher premiums because of their preexisting medical conditions , and craft skimpy benefits packages that will appeal mostly to young and healthy people .
For example : I looked at the short-term plans available to someone like me in Washington , DC , on the website eHealthInsurance . The cheapest plan would run $ 94 per month ; the most expensive would be $ 504 . The cheapest unsubsidized Obamacare plan , by contrast , is $ 232 each month .
A plan that costs $ 94 a month sounds like a great deal , if you can get it . But a lot of people can ’ t : All the short-term plans I looked at include an “ underwriting ” questionnaire , which asked whether I had any preexisting health conditions .
The application for one plan stated clearly : if I answered yes to the questions below , “ coverage can not be issued. ” These are two of the questions I ’ d have to answer :
Even if I said no , the plan would have a long list of benefits it wouldn ’ t pay for , including :
Injuries resulting from “ skydiving , scuba diving , auto racing , bungee jumping , hang or ultra light gliding , parasailing , sail planing , or rodeo contests ”
Treatment for “ skin tags and other specific conditions of the skin and skin diseases ”
This is only a partial list of exclusions for one plan ( you can read the entire list here ) . Notably , this plan would charge me a higher premium because I am a woman : a $ 94 monthly premium versus the $ 77 premium my twin brother would pay for the exact same policy . Before the Affordable Care Act took effect , it was common for insurance plans to charge women of childbearing age higher premiums . Obamacare outlawed that practice .
The Obama administration tried to curtail the presence of plans like this in the individual market , on the grounds that they disadvantage sick Americans and offer a false sense of security by excluding a whole slew of benefits .
In 2015 , the government limited these types of short-term plans to only offering 90-day policies that were not renewable ( although some states seemed to be finding ways to skirt that rule ) . Now the Trump administration is going in the opposite direction : allowing these “ short-term ” policies to run for 364 days and exploring whether to allow consumers to renew them .
The Trump administration has framed this decision as bringing more choice into the insurance marketplace , and for some , that ’ s true . Healthy people will certainly have more choice to sign up for these skimpier plans . But sicker people will end up paying the price of those healthy people exiting the Obamacare marketplace .
Help our reporting Hospitals keep ER fees secret . Share your bill here to help change that .
Health policy experts know whom these short-term plans appeal to : young , healthy people who want a cheaper option than Healthcare.gov currently offers . This is especially true for young , healthy people who earn just slightly too much to qualify for Obamacare ’ s premium subsidies , meaning they foot their entire insurance bill on their own .
“ This is really attractive to currently uninsured , young , and probably male individuals who are making just over 400 percent of the poverty line [ the cutoff for Obamacare subsidies ] , ” Anderson says .
These people will likely leave the Obamacare marketplace , flocking to these new , cheaper plans . And most of them will probably be fine if they don ’ t have a catastrophic incident . But that ’ s the thing about health care : You can ’ t predict who might have a catastrophic health expense — the result of a rodeo contest , perhaps — that these short-term plans won ’ t cover .
Some of those people might end up losers in this new insurance scheme . And we know another group of people who will definitely be disadvantaged by the Trump rules : sicker Americans , who won ’ t be allowed into these skimpy new plans .
They will stay behind in the Obamacare insurance marketplace . And those without insurance subsidies will likely see their premiums go up as the healthy people head for the exits .
How many people flee the marketplaces — and how much premiums rise — is really hard to predict . The Trump administration thinks it will be in the neighborhood of 100,000 to 200,000 people , from a marketplace that has about 10 million enrollees . They believe this will lead to premiums rising $ 2 to $ 4 per person .
Some analysts agree with them , although they expect the number would rise over time .
“ It sounds potentially reasonable , but I think longer term , you ’ d expect that number to rise , ” says Chris Sloan , a senior manager with the research firm Avalere Health .
But others think it ’ s much too low — that the marketplaces will see many more people ( particularly the 14 percent of Obamacare enrollees who don ’ t receive insurance subsidies ) leaving the market .
These people , if they ’ re healthy , won ’ t have much to lose . Their premiums will go down if they switch to a short-term plan . And unlike previous years , they won ’ t have to pay a penalty for not carrying Obamacare-compliant coverage . That ’ s because the recently passed Republican tax bill nixed Obamacare ’ s individual mandate .
What type of people are likely to lose in this scenario ? Anderson thinks of a family that was often described by Sen. Bill Cassidy ( R-LA ) during the Obamacare repeal debate as paying $ 40,000 in annual premiums ( the Washington Post tracked down this family and found it was closer to $ 31,000 , or $ 2,654 each month for a family of four ) .
That family has a daughter who has seizures and needs four different medications . They earn too much to receive Obamacare subsidies ( the family says their income is somewhere in the six figures , described by one family member as “ not high but middle class ” ) , so they pay their full premium .
This family ’ s premiums are a significant burden , no doubt . But these new “ choices ” won ’ t fix that problem because the short-term plans won ’ t accept a family whose child has significant , expensive medical needs . They aren ’ t required to take on enrollees with preexisting conditions , so they won ’ t . Those people are expensive and raise premiums .
These are the people who will get left behind in the Obamacare marketplaces as healthier people switch to the short-term plans . And they ’ ll face higher premiums there as a result .
“ That family is going to be far worse off , ” says Anderson . “ They make too much money for subsidies , but they have someone in the family who can not be in , or even get into , an underwritten plan . ”
One state is instructing insurers to ignore Obamacare . The Trump administration is doing nothing .
Want to know how the Trump administration feels about pre-existing conditions ? Take a look at the situation currently unfolding in Idaho .
A few weeks ago , state regulators sent health plans a bulletin . It said that they could once again start charging higher prices to people with preexisting conditions .

These are all practices that the Affordable Care Act clearly bars .
The Idaho guidance wasn ’ t limited to short-term plans . It said that insurers could do this for long-term , regular health plans too , so long as they offer at least one Obamacare-complaint plan on the market . This Idaho plan would have the same effect , in practice , as the federal regulations : moving healthy people to a cheaper market while leaving sicker people behind in a more expensive market .

The Trump administration was already weakening Obamacare

For example, it hasn’t intervened in Idaho, where regulators recently told insurers they can simply disregard many of the Affordable Care Act rules and sell new “freedom plans” that discriminate against sicker enrollees.

Bringing back bare-bones plans will likely increase premiums

Health policy experts know whom these short-term plans appeal to: young, healthy people who want a cheaper option than Healthcare.gov currently offers. This is especially true for young, healthy people who earn just slightly too much to qualify for Obamacare’s premium subsidies, meaning they foot their entire insurance bill on their own.

[ Heritage Action announced ] Tuesday it will `` key vote '' a bill the House is poised to take up that ditches the law 's individual and employer mandates , a number of the law 's taxes and several other components , including an independent panel to cut Medicare costs . That 's because the bill does n't fully repeal the Affordable Care Act , including its major spending provisions -- the expansion of Medicaid and subsidies for individuals to purchase insurance on the exchanges . By using the reconciliation process to get rid of the healthcare law they hate , Republicans only have to gain a simple majority of Senate votes . But under those rules , only provisions that are tied to spending can be included in the measure ... Policy experts agree that using budget reconciliation rules to repeal Obamacare is Republicans ' best chance to put a repeal bill on President Obama 's desk , even though the president is virtually guaranteed to veto it . The move by Heritage complicates the effort , as it puts pressure on conservatives to vote against a bill they had otherwise been enthusiastic about . And by punishing Republicans , Heritage may inadvertently praise Democrats , who plan to vote against reconciliation because they support the healthcare law . [ A spokesman ] would n't tell the Washington Examiner whether Democrats will get a positive score from Heritage for opposing the bill .
In the Obamacare fight , reconciliation ’ s aim is to set a legislative precedent for a Republican president to follow . Forcing a presidential veto of a bill repealing Obamacare will cause every presidential candidate to answer a simple question – what would you have done ? Every serious Republican candidate will answer that they would repeal it in a heartbeat .

[Heritage Action announced] Tuesday it will ""key vote"" a bill the House is poised to take up that ditches the law's individual and employer mandates, a number of the law's taxes and several other components, including an independent panel to cut Medicare costs. That's because the bill doesn't fully repeal the Affordable Care Act, including its major spending provisions -- the expansion of Medicaid and subsidies for individuals to purchase insurance on the exchanges. By using the reconciliation process to get rid of the healthcare law they hate, Republicans only have to gain a simple majority of Senate votes. But under those rules, only provisions that are tied to spending can be included in the measure...Policy experts agree that using budget reconciliation rules to repeal Obamacare is Republicans' best chance to put a repeal bill on President Obama's desk, even though the president is virtually guaranteed to veto it. The move by Heritage complicates the effort, as it puts pressure on conservatives to vote against a bill they had otherwise been enthusiastic about. And by punishing Republicans, Heritage may inadvertently praise Democrats, who plan to vote against reconciliation because they support the healthcare law. [A spokesman] wouldn't tell the Washington Examiner whether Democrats will get a positive score from Heritage for opposing the bill.

In the Obamacare fight, reconciliation’s aim is to set a legislative precedent for a Republican president to follow. Forcing a presidential veto of a bill repealing Obamacare will cause every presidential candidate to answer a simple question – what would you have done? Every serious Republican candidate will answer that they would repeal it in a heartbeat. But if reconciliation is simply used to remove a few provisions, it does not provoke the conversation and force a Republican nominee to continue to support repealing Obamacare in its entirety. In addition to leaving one of Planned Parenthood’s main funding sources intact, the reconciliation tool is ineffective in defunding Planned Parenthood because it does not contain sufficient leverage to succeed. The reconciliation tool can only place a standalone bill on the President’s desk, which would be promptly vetoed.

In Alabama , the county in which you ’ re arrested could be the deciding factor in who will be financially responsible for your medical bills behind bars .
In Baldwin County , known for its white-sand Gulf Coast beaches and waterfront communities , the sheriff ’ s office ensures that inmates in the county jail do not have to pay anything more than a $ 15 copayment for medical care .
“ Inmates are not billed for the full cost of any medical care either inside or outside ” the jail , Sheriff Hoss Mack said in an email . “ Alabama Code Title 14 assigns financial responsibility of inmates ’ medical treatment to the department where they are being held . ”
Just across the bay in Mobile County , home to one of the busiest ports in the U.S. and the eponymous city of nearly 200,000 people built around it , Sheriff Sam Cochran takes a different tack : Some of his inmates are personally on the hook for the full cost of medically necessary care they receive from outside doctors while incarcerated , even if they are awaiting trial .
The difference between the two sheriffs ’ approaches demonstrates the unique power Alabama sheriffs have to set their own rules and answer only to voters . Legal experts and civil rights advocates say sheriffs like Cochran are likely violating both state law and the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution , which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment and excessive fines .
It ’ s not just happening in Mobile County . In multiple instances confirmed by AL.com and ███ , inmates have had medical bills sent to collections while they were still behind bars , damaging their credit and putting pressure on their family members to pay up to ensure the care continued .
Get Our Top Investigations Subscribe to the Big Story newsletter .
Brandon DeLaFosse is among them . He was arrested on domestic violence , burglary and robbery charges and booked into the Mobile County Metro Jail in November 2018 , three months after he underwent surgery on his inner ear . Since then , he has received bills totaling thousands of dollars for necessary follow-up appointments and tests , some of which have gone to collections while he remains behind bars .
“ He keeps getting bills in the mail , ” said Alicia DeLaFosse , Brandon ’ s mother , who has paid hundreds of dollars for care he has received while in custody . “ It ’ s all money he owes from going back and forth to the doctor . ”
Like many inmates , DeLaFosse doesn ’ t have significant income or access to public or private insurance in jail .
Alabama law is clear : If an “ inmate develops a medical condition which requires immediate treatment at a medical-care facility outside the county jail , the department shall be financially responsible for the cost of the treatment of the inmate . ”
But Cochran said when the jail ’ s doctors determine inmates need care that goes beyond what in-house medical staff and contracted outpatient providers can handle , they are often taken to private medical professionals who do not have contracts with the jail . And he allows those medical providers to bill at least some of those inmates directly .
“ When that person is taken out to that private medical facility or something like that , then , yeah , they ’ re going to bill him for that treatment , ” Cochran said during an interview in his office last month . “ It ’ s a more than reasonable thing to do . ”
Asked later about the details of Brandon DeLaFosse ’ s case and how the practice squares with state and federal law , Cochran provided an email written by Trey Oliver , warden of the Mobile County Metro Jail .
Oliver wrote that inmates are required to pay “ when they have a follow-up procedure or visit from a surgery conducted prior to being booked . ”
As for DeLaFosse , Oliver wrote , “ There was a follow up visit or two and his mother agreed to pay it beforehand . ”
Most jails and prisons across Alabama and the U.S. either have doctors and nurses on staff or contract with outside companies to provide medical care in their lockups . It ’ s not uncommon for inmates to be charged low copays — typically less than $ 20 — for medications and medical services .
But requiring inmates to foot the bill for their health care takes that practice to another level .
That ’ s “ like charging them for their own food , ” said John Lentine , a Birmingham criminal defense attorney and adjunct law professor at Samford University ’ s Cumberland School of Law and the Birmingham School of Law . “ To me it ’ s a basic human rights kind of thing . ”
Read More An Inmate Needed Emergency Medical Help . The Jail ’ s Response : See if She Has Insurance . Audio obtained by AL.com and ███ shows the jail administrator wanted to see if they would be responsible for an inmate ’ s medical bills before sending her to the hospital . She died a day later .
Michele Deitch , a senior lecturer at the University of Texas at Austin ’ s School of Law and Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs , said the practice is “ absolutely ” unconstitutional .
“ There is a constitutional obligation to provide health care that meets the serious medical needs of people who are incarcerated , ” said Deitch , who co-wrote the American Bar Association ’ s Standards on Treatment of Prisoners . “ That ’ s not negotiable . ”
The tactic is another way in which sheriffs across Alabama are avoiding financial responsibility for inmate medical care . AL.com and ███ reported in September that many sheriffs in Alabama and across the country are finding ways to release inmates from jail just before they incur expensive hospital bills , a tactic known as “ medical bond . ”
In several recent cases , incarcerated people around the country have successfully challenged policies restricting their access to free medical care in prison .
Last year , a federal court ruled that transgender inmates in Missouri ’ s state prisons have a right to receive hormone therapy free of charge while incarcerated , regardless of whether they were already receiving the treatments when they were taken into custody . And this year , prisoners in Minnesota reached a settlement with the state ’ s Department of Corrections that requires the prison system to provide prisoners who have Hepatitis C with expensive drugs that often cure the infection .
AL.com and ███ attempted to contact the sheriffs of all 67 counties in Alabama via email or phone to ask whether they allow inmates to be billed for care they receive while incarcerated . Of those , 13 sheriffs and one chief deputy responded . The sheriff of Mobile County and chief deputy of Jackson County each said they allow providers to bill inmates for necessary care in certain situations . Ten sheriffs said they do not allow inmates to be billed . Two others declined to comment .
Days after Thanksgiving last year , Brandon DeLaFosse was arrested in Mississippi on outstanding warrants stemming from an incident earlier that month in Mobile County , Alabama .
The then-28-year-old was driven back to Mobile , where he stayed in the county jail until Feb. 28 , when he was sentenced to three years in prison .
DeLaFosse ’ s health problems continued behind bars . Since his ear surgery last year , he has suffered from persistent ear infections and severe hearing loss .
In between Marlboro Lights and peanut butter-and-syrup sandwiches at her Irvington home last month , DeLaFosse ’ s mother , Alicia , said she spends many hours each week making calls , sending emails and conducting research to advocate on behalf of her son .
She said a steady stream of medical bills addressed to her son has arrived at her house since his arrest . Billing records show that she has spent more than $ 600 on his care since his arrest , and more than $ 1,000 in outstanding bills have gone to debt collection .

On Dec. 6 , 2018 , while he was in the Mobile County Metro Jail , Brandon DeLaFosse was taken to see an ear , nose and throat specialist at Providence Hospital in Mobile for a surgery follow-up visit recommended by the doctor . But first , his mother said , jail staff required her to make a payment to the doctor ’ s office . After the appointment , the hospital ’ s billing department sent a bill for $ 729 for tests he underwent that day to Alicia DeLaFosse ’ s house .
“ The way the nurse at the jail explained it to me is because it was something that didn ’ t happen at the jail , it ’ s preexisting . ... I had to go pay for it myself , ” she said . “ For the jail to allow him to go see the doctor , I had to go to the doctor ’ s office and pay $ 125 first . ”
A registered nurse at the jail in Mobile noted in Brandon DeLaFosse ’ s medical record that his mother made a payment and that the nurse had scheduled a follow-up visit for later that month . In January 2019 , a nurse practitioner at the jail wrote a note in his file stating she would request another follow-up appointment with his doctor “ with the expectation that it is handled in the usual fashion with his mother arranging for payment . ”
`` I don ’ t think it ’ s fair . They 're responsible for my medical care , so why should it be coming out of my pockets or my family 's pockets ? '' Brandon DeLaFosse said in a jailhouse phone call .
Cochran , the Mobile County sheriff , said via email that he views the situation as a “ legal dispute between [ Brandon DeLaFosse ] , us and our contracted provider . I know of no complaint or claim made against us . ”
“ The mom agreed to pay [ the ] bill . Looks like she reneged , ” Cochran wrote . “ Otherwise if it would have been medically necessary our contracted folks would have handled . ”
Alicia DeLaFosse said she “ didn ’ t renege ” and paid for all of the medical costs she knew about in advance .
Brandon DeLaFosse continued to be billed for outside medical care after he was moved to state prison . On July 23 , nearly five months after his sentence began , he saw a doctor and underwent tests at Providence Hospital . He was sent a bill for $ 224.70 for outpatient diagnostics administered that day , plus $ 71.98 for the doctor visit .
That shouldn ’ t have happened , a spokeswoman for the Alabama Department of Corrections said in a statement .
“ By ADOC ’ S policy , all inmates in the care , custody , and control of any ADOC correctional facility are not charged or responsible for community-based medical care or mental health services , ” the spokeswoman , Samantha Banks , said .
Any state prisoners “ incorrectly ” billed for outpatient medical care should notify the provider that they were incarcerated at the time , the statement explained . “ The medical provider should submit to the Department the appropriate paperwork and any outstanding inmate medical bills will be directed to the appropriate payer . ”
State prisoners in Arizona have reported similar issues with providers billing them directly for medical care they received while incarcerated , as KJZZ radio reported this year . Like in Alabama , the Arizona Department of Corrections has said the bills were sent out in error and that the department or its medical contractor would pay the inmates ’ bills .
But that ’ s a vastly different situation than the one facing inmates in some Alabama counties , where sheriff ’ s offices are not chalking up such bills to error and are in fact deliberately choosing to avoid paying medical bills for inmates in their charge .
Though the public often has little sympathy for inmates , incarcerated people do have clear rights , particularly when it comes to health care behind bars .
Alabama law states that “ necessary clothing and bedding must be furnished by the sheriff or jailer , at the expense of the county , to those prisoners who are unable to provide them for themselves , and also necessary medicines and medical attention to those who are sick or injured , when they are unable to provide them for themselves . ”
In another section of the state code , a definition of a county inmate includes an explicit reference to their health care being provided for : “ any person being held in a public institution under the administrative control and responsibility of the county sheriff and for whom the county is responsible for the provision of medical care . ”
Brandon Blankenship , an assistant professor of law and ethics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham , said that allowing inmates to be billed for care that they receive while incarcerated amounts to cruel and unusual punishment and that the bills are excessive fines .
“ I don ’ t think it ’ s ever been challenged in court in Alabama , but from where I ’ m sitting , the answer to me is that , no , it ’ s certainly not constitutional under the Eighth Amendment . ”
The tactics of some Alabama sheriffs stand in sharp contrast to what ’ s going on elsewhere in the country . This year , California and Illinois banned the practice of charging inmates copays , and a number of other states have taken , or are considering , steps to rein in the practice .
“ They usually can not afford even a $ 5 copay , so the idea that they could pay thousands of dollars for these services is laughable from a practical perspective and it ’ s downright evil on many different levels , ” said Deitch , the University of Texas at Austin professor .
In 1983 , the U.S. Supreme Court decided a seminal case , City of Revere v. Massachusetts General Hospital , involving a person who was hurt during an arrest and taken to a hospital . The court ruled that “ as long as the governmental entity ensures that the medical care needed is in fact provided , the Constitution does not dictate how the cost of that care should be allocated as between the entity and the provider of the care . That is a matter of state law . ”
But that ruling did not answer the question of whether inmates can be stuck with the bill .
Read More These Sheriffs Release Sick Inmates to Avoid Paying Their Hospital Bills Inmates suffering heart attacks , on the verge of diabetic comas and brutalized in jail beatings have been released so sheriffs wouldn ’ t have to pay for their medical care . Some were rearrested once they had recovered .
“ We don ’ t have any clear Supreme Court ruling , ” said Fred Cohen , a professor emeritus at the University at Albany ’ s School of Criminal Justice who has decades of experience in corrections law and serves as executive editor of Correctional Law Reporter .
Cohen said he believes there is a good case to be made that the practice of allowing inmates to be billed for medical care violates their constitutional rights .
“ I don ’ t think it ’ s an open policy question in that inmates should not be required to pay , ” he said . “ I think it could be held unconstitutional by the right court . ”
Several days after Charles Tillman was booked into the Washington County Jail in March 2018 , his left testicle became severely inflamed . He told a guard , and on March 22 , Tillman was taken to Washington County Hospital for treatment and an ultrasound .
The 40-year-old , who has a long rap sheet , was driven back to the jail following the appointment and was released from the facility the following day . ( The Washington County Sheriff ’ s Office confirmed the dates of his incarceration . But the nature of his offense was not clear based on court records , and the sheriff ’ s office would not discuss his charges during a phone call with Tillman and a reporter . )
It wasn ’ t until weeks later that Tillman learned that he had been billed directly for that visit and that the debt had been sent to a collector , upending his credit . He showed AL.com and ███ a copy of his credit report showing it had been negatively affected by unpaid medical bills .
“ They tried to get me to sign paperwork but I refused to sign it , the hospital bill saying I was responsible for it . ”
As of this month , Tillman still owed $ 1,856.42 for medical care he received at Washington County Hospital . The hospital confirmed that it treated him during each of his brief incarcerations in the jail in February 2017 , March 2018 and September 2018 .
“ I got the bills at my [ home ] address , ” said Tillman , who has since been released . “ They ’ re on my credit report now as negative marks — that ’ s what ’ s keeping me from getting a car right now . ”
Washington County Sheriff Richard Stringer was unable to explain Tillman ’ s situation , saying the county ’ s policy is to pay for all medical costs for inmates who aren ’ t covered by insurance .
“ That ’ s not standard procedure , ” Stringer said . “ It would have to be an unusual case for that to happen , and I don ’ t keep up with every case that comes in . But no , that ’ s not our policy. “
Hundreds of miles northeast , Rocky Harnen , chief deputy of the Jackson County Sheriff ’ s Office , said preexisting conditions should be inmates ’ responsibility .
“ If it ’ s something preexisting , say diabetes or something , and you ’ ve got to go to the doctor every now and then , then that ’ s their responsibility to pay for that , ” he said .
“ If it ’ s going to your own doctor , they would be responsible for that . I guess they would bill them at their house . The taxpayers shouldn ’ t be responsible for ongoing issues that are preexisting . ”
Harnen referred subsequent questions about the legality of the practice to County Attorney John Porter , who did not cite any laws that allowed it .
“ I can ’ t say that there ’ s not any medical care that they have to pay for , ” Porter said .
Asked if inmates sometimes have to pay for outpatient care for preexisting conditions , he said , “ I wouldn ’ t say that that ’ s incorrect . … I can ’ t give you a blanket answer to that but it would be depending on the circumstances . ”
That ’ s not the way inmate health care works in many county jails across Alabama . In Etowah County , northeast of Birmingham , inmates are never billed for care they receive while incarcerated , according to Sheriff Jonathon Horton .
“ We provide medical services for inmates in our care so they should not receive any bills , ” Horton said . “ They shouldn ’ t be billed . That ’ s my understanding . ”
Lauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton said that he would love to have inmates in his jail in northwest Alabama foot the bill for certain types of medical care , but that he is not legally able to do so . For instance , he said he would like to have avoided the $ 300,000 the county once had to pay for open heart surgery for “ the town drunk ” arrested on a public intoxication charge .
“ If they ’ re in jail on public intoxication and they ’ ve got preexisting health conditions , I don ’ t think the taxpayer should have to foot the bill to pay for it , ” Singleton said . “ If they get injured inside the jail or they get sick inside the jail , we of course pay for it . But my issue is with having to pay for preexisting conditions . But we have to do it . ”

Just across the bay in Mobile County, home to one of the busiest ports in the U.S. and the eponymous city of nearly 200,000 people built around it, Sheriff Sam Cochran takes a different tack: Some of his inmates are personally on the hook for the full cost of medically necessary care they receive from outside doctors while incarcerated, even if they are awaiting trial.

The difference between the two sheriffs’ approaches demonstrates the unique power Alabama sheriffs have to set their own rules and answer only to voters. Legal experts and civil rights advocates say sheriffs like Cochran are likely violating both state law and the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment and excessive fines.

It’s not just happening in Mobile County. In multiple instances confirmed by AL.com and ProPublica, inmates have had medical bills sent to collections while they were still behind bars, damaging their credit and putting pressure on their family members to pay up to ensure the care continued.

Brandon DeLaFosse is among them. He was arrested on domestic violence, burglary and robbery charges and booked into the Mobile County Metro Jail in November 2018, three months after he underwent surgery on his inner ear. Since then, he has received bills totaling thousands of dollars for necessary follow-up appointments and tests, some of which have gone to collections while he remains behind bars.

“He keeps getting bills in the mail,” said Alicia DeLaFosse, Brandon’s mother, who has paid hundreds of dollars for care he has received while in custody. “It’s all money he owes from going back and forth to the doctor.”

Like many inmates, DeLaFosse doesn’t have significant income or access to public or private insurance in jail.

Alabama law is clear: If an “inmate develops a medical condition which requires immediate treatment at a medical-care facility outside the county jail, the department shall be financially responsible for the cost of the treatment of the inmate.”

But Cochran said when the jail’s doctors determine inmates need care that goes beyond what in-house medical staff and contracted outpatient providers can handle, they are often taken to private medical professionals who do not have contracts with the jail. And he allows those medical providers to bill at least some of those inmates directly.

“When that person is taken out to that private medical facility or something like that, then, yeah, they’re going to bill him for that treatment,” Cochran said during an interview in his office last month. “It’s a more than reasonable thing to do.”

Asked later about the details of Brandon DeLaFosse’s case and how the practice squares with state and federal law, Cochran provided an email written by Trey Oliver, warden of the Mobile County Metro Jail.

Oliver wrote that inmates are required to pay “when they have a follow-up procedure or visit from a surgery conducted prior to being booked.”

As for DeLaFosse, Oliver wrote, “There was a follow up visit or two and his mother agreed to pay it beforehand.”

Most jails and prisons across Alabama and the U.S. either have doctors and nurses on staff or contract with outside companies to provide medical care in their lockups. It’s not uncommon for inmates to be charged low copays — typically less than $20 — for medications and medical services.

But requiring inmates to foot the bill for their health care takes that practice to another level.

That’s “like charging them for their own food,” said John Lentine, a Birmingham criminal defense attorney and adjunct law professor at Samford University’s Cumberland School of Law and the Birmingham School of Law. “To me it’s a basic human rights kind of thing.”

Read More An Inmate Needed Emergency Medical Help. The Jail’s Response: See if She Has Insurance. Audio obtained by AL.com and ProPublica shows the jail administrator wanted to see if they would be responsible for an inmate’s medical bills before sending her to the hospital. She died a day later.

Michele Deitch, a senior lecturer at the University of Texas at Austin’s School of Law and Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, said the practice is “absolutely” unconstitutional.

“There is a constitutional obligation to provide health care that meets the serious medical needs of people who are incarcerated,” said Deitch, who co-wrote the American Bar Association’s Standards on Treatment of Prisoners. “That’s not negotiable.”

The tactic is another way in which sheriffs across Alabama are avoiding financial responsibility for inmate medical care. AL.com and ProPublica reported in September that many sheriffs in Alabama and across the country are finding ways to release inmates from jail just before they incur expensive hospital bills, a tactic known as “medical bond.”

In several recent cases, incarcerated people around the country have successfully challenged policies restricting their access to free medical care in prison.

Last year, a federal court ruled that transgender inmates in Missouri’s state prisons have a right to receive hormone therapy free of charge while incarcerated, regardless of whether they were already receiving the treatments when they were taken into custody. And this year, prisoners in Minnesota reached a settlement with the state’s Department of Corrections that requires the prison system to provide prisoners who have Hepatitis C with expensive drugs that often cure the infection.

AL.com and ProPublica attempted to contact the sheriffs of all 67 counties in Alabama via email or phone to ask whether they allow inmates to be billed for care they receive while incarcerated. Of those, 13 sheriffs and one chief deputy responded. The sheriff of Mobile County and chief deputy of Jackson County each said they allow providers to bill inmates for necessary care in certain situations. Ten sheriffs said they do not allow inmates to be billed. Two others declined to comment.

“I’m Still Getting Bills”

Days after Thanksgiving last year, Brandon DeLaFosse was arrested in Mississippi on outstanding warrants stemming from an incident earlier that month in Mobile County, Alabama.

The then-28-year-old was driven back to Mobile, where he stayed in the county jail until Feb. 28, when he was sentenced to three years in prison.

DeLaFosse’s health problems continued behind bars. Since his ear surgery last year, he has suffered from persistent ear infections and severe hearing loss.

And his bills are piling up.

In between Marlboro Lights and peanut butter-and-syrup sandwiches at her Irvington home last month, DeLaFosse’s mother, Alicia, said she spends many hours each week making calls, sending emails and conducting research to advocate on behalf of her son.

She said a steady stream of medical bills addressed to her son has arrived at her house since his arrest. Billing records show that she has spent more than $600 on his care since his arrest, and more than $1,000 in outstanding bills have gone to debt collection.

On Dec. 6, 2018, while he was in the Mobile County Metro Jail, Brandon DeLaFosse was taken to see an ear, nose and throat specialist at Providence Hospital in Mobile for a surgery follow-up visit recommended by the doctor. But first, his mother said, jail staff required her to make a payment to the doctor’s office. After the appointment, the hospital’s billing department sent a bill for $729 for tests he underwent that day to Alicia DeLaFosse’s house.

“The way the nurse at the jail explained it to me is because it was something that didn’t happen at the jail, it’s preexisting. ... I had to go pay for it myself,” she said. “For the jail to allow him to go see the doctor, I had to go to the doctor’s office and pay $125 first.”

A registered nurse at the jail in Mobile noted in Brandon DeLaFosse’s medical record that his mother made a payment and that the nurse had scheduled a follow-up visit for later that month. In January 2019, a nurse practitioner at the jail wrote a note in his file stating she would request another follow-up appointment with his doctor “with the expectation that it is handled in the usual fashion with his mother arranging for payment.”

""I don’t think it’s fair. They're responsible for my medical care, so why should it be coming out of my pockets or my family's pockets?"" Brandon DeLaFosse said in a jailhouse phone call.

Cochran, the Mobile County sheriff, said via email that he views the situation as a “legal dispute between [Brandon DeLaFosse], us and our contracted provider. I know of no complaint or claim made against us.”

“The mom agreed to pay [the] bill. Looks like she reneged,” Cochran wrote. “Otherwise if it would have been medically necessary our contracted folks would have handled.”

Alicia DeLaFosse said she “didn’t renege” and paid for all of the medical costs she knew about in advance.

Brandon DeLaFosse continued to be billed for outside medical care after he was moved to state prison. On July 23, nearly five months after his sentence began, he saw a doctor and underwent tests at Providence Hospital. He was sent a bill for $224.70 for outpatient diagnostics administered that day, plus $71.98 for the doctor visit.

That shouldn’t have happened, a spokeswoman for the Alabama Department of Corrections said in a statement.

“By ADOC’S policy, all inmates in the care, custody, and control of any ADOC correctional facility are not charged or responsible for community-based medical care or mental health services,” the spokeswoman, Samantha Banks, said.

Any state prisoners “incorrectly” billed for outpatient medical care should notify the provider that they were incarcerated at the time, the statement explained. “The medical provider should submit to the Department the appropriate paperwork and any outstanding inmate medical bills will be directed to the appropriate payer.”

State prisoners in Arizona have reported similar issues with providers billing them directly for medical care they received while incarcerated, as KJZZ radio reported this year. Like in Alabama, the Arizona Department of Corrections has said the bills were sent out in error and that the department or its medical contractor would pay the inmates’ bills.

But that’s a vastly different situation than the one facing inmates in some Alabama counties, where sheriff’s offices are not chalking up such bills to error and are in fact deliberately choosing to avoid paying medical bills for inmates in their charge.

Constitutional Question

Though the public often has little sympathy for inmates, incarcerated people do have clear rights, particularly when it comes to health care behind bars.

Alabama law states that “necessary clothing and bedding must be furnished by the sheriff or jailer, at the expense of the county, to those prisoners who are unable to provide them for themselves, and also necessary medicines and medical attention to those who are sick or injured, when they are unable to provide them for themselves.”

In another section of the state code, a definition of a county inmate includes an explicit reference to their health care being provided for: “any person being held in a public institution under the administrative control and responsibility of the county sheriff and for whom the county is responsible for the provision of medical care.”

Brandon Blankenship, an assistant professor of law and ethics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said that allowing inmates to be billed for care that they receive while incarcerated amounts to cruel and unusual punishment and that the bills are excessive fines.

“I don’t think it’s ever been challenged in court in Alabama, but from where I’m sitting, the answer to me is that, no, it’s certainly not constitutional under the Eighth Amendment.”

The tactics of some Alabama sheriffs stand in sharp contrast to what’s going on elsewhere in the country. This year, California and Illinois banned the practice of charging inmates copays, and a number of other states have taken, or are considering, steps to rein in the practice.

“They usually cannot afford even a $5 copay, so the idea that they could pay thousands of dollars for these services is laughable from a practical perspective and it’s downright evil on many different levels,” said Deitch, the University of Texas at Austin professor.

In 1983, the U.S. Supreme Court decided a seminal case, City of Revere v. Massachusetts General Hospital, involving a person who was hurt during an arrest and taken to a hospital. The court ruled that “as long as the governmental entity ensures that the medical care needed is in fact provided, the Constitution does not dictate how the cost of that care should be allocated as between the entity and the provider of the care. That is a matter of state law.”

But that ruling did not answer the question of whether inmates can be stuck with the bill.

Read More These Sheriffs Release Sick Inmates to Avoid Paying Their Hospital Bills Inmates suffering heart attacks, on the verge of diabetic comas and brutalized in jail beatings have been released so sheriffs wouldn’t have to pay for their medical care. Some were rearrested once they had recovered.

“We don’t have any clear Supreme Court ruling,” said Fred Cohen, a professor emeritus at the University at Albany’s School of Criminal Justice who has decades of experience in corrections law and serves as executive editor of Correctional Law Reporter.

Cohen said he believes there is a good case to be made that the practice of allowing inmates to be billed for medical care violates their constitutional rights.

“I don’t think it’s an open policy question in that inmates should not be required to pay,” he said. “I think it could be held unconstitutional by the right court.”

Different Systems

Several days after Charles Tillman was booked into the Washington County Jail in March 2018, his left testicle became severely inflamed. He told a guard, and on March 22, Tillman was taken to Washington County Hospital for treatment and an ultrasound.

The 40-year-old, who has a long rap sheet, was driven back to the jail following the appointment and was released from the facility the following day. (The Washington County Sheriff’s Office confirmed the dates of his incarceration. But the nature of his offense was not clear based on court records, and the sheriff’s office would not discuss his charges during a phone call with Tillman and a reporter.)

It wasn’t until weeks later that Tillman learned that he had been billed directly for that visit and that the debt had been sent to a collector, upending his credit. He showed AL.com and ProPublica a copy of his credit report showing it had been negatively affected by unpaid medical bills.

“They tried to get me to sign paperwork but I refused to sign it, the hospital bill saying I was responsible for it.”

As of this month, Tillman still owed $1,856.42 for medical care he received at Washington County Hospital. The hospital confirmed that it treated him during each of his brief incarcerations in the jail in February 2017, March 2018 and September 2018.

“I got the bills at my [home] address,” said Tillman, who has since been released. “They’re on my credit report now as negative marks — that’s what’s keeping me from getting a car right now.”

Washington County Sheriff Richard Stringer was unable to explain Tillman’s situation, saying the county’s policy is to pay for all medical costs for inmates who aren’t covered by insurance.

“That’s not standard procedure,” Stringer said. “It would have to be an unusual case for that to happen, and I don’t keep up with every case that comes in. But no, that’s not our policy.“

Hundreds of miles northeast, Rocky Harnen, chief deputy of the Jackson County Sheriff’s Office, said preexisting conditions should be inmates’ responsibility.

“If it’s something preexisting, say diabetes or something, and you’ve got to go to the doctor every now and then, then that’s their responsibility to pay for that,” he said.

“If it’s going to your own doctor, they would be responsible for that. I guess they would bill them at their house. The taxpayers shouldn’t be responsible for ongoing issues that are preexisting.”

Harnen referred subsequent questions about the legality of the practice to County Attorney John Porter, who did not cite any laws that allowed it.

“I can’t say that there’s not any medical care that they have to pay for,” Porter said.

Asked if inmates sometimes have to pay for outpatient care for preexisting conditions, he said, “I wouldn’t say that that’s incorrect. … I can’t give you a blanket answer to that but it would be depending on the circumstances.”

That’s not the way inmate health care works in many county jails across Alabama. In Etowah County, northeast of Birmingham, inmates are never billed for care they receive while incarcerated, according to Sheriff Jonathon Horton.

“We provide medical services for inmates in our care so they should not receive any bills,” Horton said. “They shouldn’t be billed. That’s my understanding.”

Lauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton said that he would love to have inmates in his jail in northwest Alabama foot the bill for certain types of medical care, but that he is not legally able to do so. For instance, he said he would like to have avoided the $300,000 the county once had to pay for open heart surgery for “the town drunk” arrested on a public intoxication charge.

“If they’re in jail on public intoxication and they’ve got preexisting health conditions, I don’t think the taxpayer should have to foot the bill to pay for it,” Singleton said. “If they get injured inside the jail or they get sick inside the jail, we of course pay for it. But my issue is with having to pay for preexisting conditions. But we have to do it.”

After tens of thousands of pain patients were forced to reduce their opioid dosages—some cut off entirely , with little warning—the federal government has finally realized that sharp cuts in prescribing are actually causing some of the harms they intended to prevent . This year , three key federal agencies issued stark warnings about suicide and overdose risk associated with these practices .
But patients , doctors , and advocates report that dose cutbacks are continuing—and a new survey shows that physicians remain hesitant to help these patients . Without changes in law enforcement policy , both patients and physicians will continue to be harmed .
In April , the Food and Drug Administration released a warning admitting that rapid opioid cessation had led to and can cause “ uncontrolled pain , psychological distress , and suicide , ” telling doctors to stop doing it .
That same month , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its guidelines with a similar message : Not all pain patients should have their opioids reduced or eliminated ; some will continue to function best on medication , even at high doses . In October , the Department of Health and Human Services added to the chorus with a tapering guide that urges physicians to avoid rapid tapers and to consider the needs of individual patients .
Unfortunately , patients themselves report that little has changed . Rapid tapers and apparently-related deaths are still occurring , desperate victims crying out for help on social media [ warning : graphic image ] . Physicians are either refusing these patients or insisting they take lower doses .
A survey of 500 primary care physicians by Quest Diagnostics conducted this summer—after the FDA and CDC announcements—and released in October found that 81 percent are reluctant to care for chronic pain patients who take opioids and 83 percent say that the pressure to reduce prescribing has made pain treatment “ considerably harder . ”
Kate Nicholson , a pain patient , civil rights attorney , and advocate based in Denver , Colorado , said she receives around five to seven unsolicited emails a day from people who are affected by the push to cut opioid prescriptions . Some have lost family members to suicide ; some are watching their loved ones suffer increased pain and disability from a forced , rapid taper . Others are concerned doctors or pain patients themselves , seeking help .
Nicholson said of the Quest survey , “ You can see if you drill down into these numbers that physicians are struggling to treat pain . Eighty-three percent say it 's considerably harder . They do n't know what to do with people. ” She added that she has n't seen much evidence that the efforts from the FDA , CDC , and HHS have led to real differences for patients .
Patrice Harris , a psychiatrist who serves as president of the American Medical Association and chair of its opioid task force said , “ We are still hearing some of these concerns as well , ” noting that her organization is continuing to fight against rigid dose limits and other policies set by insurers , pharmacies , and states that do n't allow doctors to individualize care and therefore harm patients .
“ Being a pain doctor myself , I think it 's a travesty , ” said Jeff Gudin , a senior medical advisor for Quest Diagnostics who worked on the survey and clinical associate professor of anesthesiology at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School . “ It ’ s a bad time to be a pain patient in our history of medicine , ” he said , explaining that the backlash against opioids has ignored the fact that “ science hasn ’ t given us any other medicines that are truly effective for severe levels of pain . ”
The Quest survey also found that 72 percent of doctors “ worry that chronic pain patients will turn to illicit drugs ” and that while the crackdown might reduce prescription opioid deaths , “ the trade-off is a greater number of patients whose pain is not properly managed . ”
While Gudin agreed that excessive and inappropriate prescribing—such as giving a month ’ s supply of strong opioids after wisdom teeth surgery—did need to be reined in , he said the pendulum has now swung too far in the opposite direction . ( Gudin has consulted in the past for pharmaceutical companies that manufacture opioids ) .
Pain patient and advocate Lelena Peacock , who offers emotional support to struggling patients on social media , continues to hear heartbreaking stories daily . Just last week , she had to fight for pain care for her mother who has dementia and was in intensive care . She 's heard from several relatives of people who have died by suicide in the past few months alone . Cries of distress are ubiquitous in her Twitter feed and direct messages .
“ What I ’ m hearing is that people are still being tapered , ” Peacock said , “ And what I 'm hearing is that doctor 's offices , hospitals , and insurers are setting these things as policy . ”
Indeed , many large medical organizations , insurers , and state legislatures are still acting as though the now-outdated CDC guidelines are mandates to be applied to all patients . For example , Kaiser Permanente in Spokane , Washington , in October sent patients a notice that they wanted to reduce all opioid doses to below 50 morphine equivalents ( MME , a standard measure that allows comparison of different medications ) . The 2016 CDC guideline suggested not going over 90 MME , but its April clarification emphasizes this does n't mean that all patients need to be tapered .
And some insurers are now actually paying doctors not to prescribe opioids : Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan increases the amount it will pay for specific surgeries by 35 percent if surgeons only prescribe a minimal amount of opioids afterwards . This could yield thousands of dollars per procedure for the doctors performing them . For example , with a complex gastric sleeve surgery for obesity , which can pay as much as $ 49,900 to the doctor , the additional payment would be as high as $ 17,465 . This obviously provides an enormous incentive for doctors to skimp on medication , regardless of the amount of pain their patient reports .
Underlying all these efforts and driving their continuation is a fundamental legal problem . While states are supposed to be in charge of regulating medicine , when it comes to controlled substances , the federal Drug Enforcement Administration makes the rules .
According to the law , prescribing these drugs is only legal “ in the usual course of professional practice ” and “ for a legitimate medical purpose. ” Since those terms are poorly defined—and given the current desire to cut the medical opioid supply and change the way the drugs are used—doctors are running scared .
When the CDC guidelines were initially announced in 2016 , they were widely embraced as a way for doctors to demonstrate their compliance with the law . And as the DEA intensified its prosecution of physicians who prescribed high doses , more and more doctors began either forcing patients to taper their meds to be well under the guidelines ' top dose or simply refusing to prescribe at all .
In order to be prosecuted as a drug dealer , physicians don ’ t have to commit obvious crimes like selling prescriptions to people without medical problems or trading drugs for sex—the DEA merely has to prove that the prescribing wasn ’ t “ professional practice ” and didn ’ t have a “ legitimate medical purpose . ''
That vagueness terrifies doctors , even when they have patients who they know are benefiting from doses of opioids outside the CDC guidelines . “ It opens people up to a heck of a lot more uncertainty and a heck of a lot more fear , '' Nicholson said . `` Even if they 're not themselves being investigated or prosecuted , there 's going to be more of a chilling effect because there 's no certainty there . ”
The result is a generation of pain patients who were—in some cases , wrongly—prescribed large amounts of opioids with little thought for individual differences and are now being made to give up the drugs , again , with little concern for their actual needs .
The actions taken by the CDC , FDA , and HHS are all steps in the right direction—but unless we get the DEA out of the business of determining what prescribing practices are “ legitimate , ” we will never have appropriate treatment for pain .","High Wire is Maia Szalavitz's reported opinion column on drugs and drug policy.

The Quest survey also found that 72 percent of doctors “worry that chronic pain patients will turn to illicit drugs” and that while the crackdown might reduce prescription opioid deaths, “the trade-off is a greater number of patients whose pain is not properly managed.”

While Gudin agreed that excessive and inappropriate prescribing—such as giving a month’s supply of strong opioids after wisdom teeth surgery—did need to be reined in, he said the pendulum has now swung too far in the opposite direction. (Gudin has consulted in the past for pharmaceutical companies that manufacture opioids).

Pain patient and advocate Lelena Peacock, who offers emotional support to struggling patients on social media, continues to hear heartbreaking stories daily. Just last week, she had to fight for pain care for her mother who has dementia and was in intensive care. She's heard from several relatives of people who have died by suicide in the past few months alone. Cries of distress are ubiquitous in her Twitter feed and direct messages.

“What I’m hearing is that people are still being tapered,” Peacock said, “And what I'm hearing is that doctor's offices, hospitals, and insurers are setting these things as policy.”

Indeed, many large medical organizations, insurers, and state legislatures are still acting as though the now-outdated CDC guidelines are mandates to be applied to all patients. For example, Kaiser Permanente in Spokane, Washington, in October sent patients a notice that they wanted to reduce all opioid doses to below 50 morphine equivalents (MME, a standard measure that allows comparison of different medications). The 2016 CDC guideline suggested not going over 90 MME, but its April clarification emphasizes this doesn't mean that all patients need to be tapered.

And some insurers are now actually paying doctors not to prescribe opioids: Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan increases the amount it will pay for specific surgeries by 35 percent if surgeons only prescribe a minimal amount of opioids afterwards. This could yield thousands of dollars per procedure for the doctors performing them. For example, with a complex gastric sleeve surgery for obesity, which can pay as much as $49,900 to the doctor, the additional payment would be as high as $17,465. This obviously provides an enormous incentive for doctors to skimp on medication, regardless of the amount of pain their patient reports.

Underlying all these efforts and driving their continuation is a fundamental legal problem. While states are supposed to be in charge of regulating medicine, when it comes to controlled substances, the federal Drug Enforcement Administration makes the rules.

According to the law, prescribing these drugs is only legal “in the usual course of professional practice” and “for a legitimate medical purpose.” Since those terms are poorly defined—and given the current desire to cut the medical opioid supply and change the way the drugs are used—doctors are running scared.

When the CDC guidelines were initially announced in 2016, they were widely embraced as a way for doctors to demonstrate their compliance with the law. And as the DEA intensified its prosecution of physicians who prescribed high doses, more and more doctors began either forcing patients to taper their meds to be well under the guidelines' top dose or simply refusing to prescribe at all.

In order to be prosecuted as a drug dealer, physicians don’t have to commit obvious crimes like selling prescriptions to people without medical problems or trading drugs for sex—the DEA merely has to prove that the prescribing wasn’t “professional practice” and didn’t have a “legitimate medical purpose.""

That vagueness terrifies doctors, even when they have patients who they know are benefiting from doses of opioids outside the CDC guidelines. “It opens people up to a heck of a lot more uncertainty and a heck of a lot more fear,"" Nicholson said. ""Even if they're not themselves being investigated or prosecuted, there's going to be more of a chilling effect because there's no certainty there.”

The result is a generation of pain patients who were—in some cases, wrongly—prescribed large amounts of opioids with little thought for individual differences and are now being made to give up the drugs, again, with little concern for their actual needs.

The actions taken by the CDC, FDA, and HHS are all steps in the right direction—but unless we get the DEA out of the business of determining what prescribing practices are “legitimate,” we will never have appropriate treatment for pain.

healthcare,Salon,0,http://www.salon.com/2013/11/19/a_final_countdown_for_haters_obamacares_huge_looming_deadline/,"A final countdown for haters: Obamacare's huge, looming deadline",2013-11-19,,"The approach the Obama administration has taken to fixing Healthcare.gov is incremental . They identified hundreds of `` punch list '' items ( read : screwed up things ) and set about fixing them in a logical order , which has at times revealed new problems that they 've then added to the list . It 's an iterative approach , and it 's been ongoing for weeks now .
Thus like a growing child , its changes have been less noticeable to people who interact with it regularly than to people who tuned out in early October and are just now coming around .
In just under two weeks , though , the media and the law 's critics will treat Dec. 1 as a sort of unofficial relaunch date -- as if the administration had taken the website down when it realized the extent of the problems and was only planning on relaunching once it was fully fixed .
That 's totally understandable . The administration announced a time frame for fixing the site , and has said over and over that it will be working as intended `` for the vast majority of users '' by the end of November . The implication is that people should withhold judgment until the the beginning of December and then give it a second look .
Administration officials have been intentionally vague about what they mean by `` vast majority '' and whether non-consumer facing parts of the system -- particularly the channel that transmits enrollee data to insurers -- will be in good shape . But over the weekend an anonymous official told the Washington Post , `` vast majority '' means 80 percent of users .
Let 's start with the fact that 20 percent is still a pretty big fail rate , before looking at who the 20 percent are .
There are two ways to look at -- and thus two ways to spin -- the 80/20 goal , two months after the initial rollout , which barely worked for anyone . The first is that it 'll almost certainly still leave tons of people dissatisfied , and that 's not good enough to constitute `` success . ''
The second is that it 'll allow millions of people to enroll quickly and it 'll do a decent job reducing the pent-up demand for benefits . If it had been working for 80 percent of users on day one , or if the administration had made it 80 percent of the way toward its goal of enrolling 500,000 people in private insurance in the first month , we 'd be looking at a much different political and legislative landscape than we are right now .
But as Josh Marshall notes here , an awful lot depends on who those 20 percent are , and what the Healthcare.gov experience will be like for them .
It turns out not to be quite as black and white as an 80/20 dichotomy would suggest .
According to a government official familiar with the new target , the 20 percent who are unlikely to be able to enroll online are expected to fall into three groups : people whose family circumstances are so complicated that the Web site can not determine their eligibility for subsidies to help pay for health plans ; people uncomfortable buying insurance on a computer ; and people who encounter technical problems on the Web site .
I think the key questions here are what portion of the 20 percent will encounter technical problems , and will they be as intractable as the problems consumers were encountering in early October ?
If it 's a smallish * ( * scientific term ) fraction of the 20 percent , then the people for whom the site does n't work will be a mix of technophobes ( people who would n't be using the site even if its error rate was zero ) and people with complex finances , family situations , etc . Of course , a lot of people have complex finances and family situations . And even though many of them will be used to the logistical difficulties that arise from their circumstances , one of HHS ' key goals must be to isolate those people and figure out how to make their experiences as user-friendly as possible . Not an easy task , but doable , and an easier , singular problem to contend with .
But if it 's the reverse , then a large group of people will encounter frustrating error messages , and it will be much easier for Obamacare opponents to flood reporters ' in boxes with screen grabs conveying the site 's failures . In that case , anecdata will dominate the coverage in early December both because reporters love failure , and because they 'll find it easier to pass along 404 error images than to vet any of the thousands of success stories the law 's supporters will highlight .
Either way , I think it 's fair to assume that the first couple of weeks after Dec. 1 will still be bumpy ones for Obamacare . The `` reboot '' wo n't be a dramatic inflection point . That point will only come if the fixes are adequate to move hundreds of thousands of people past the choke points , through the system and announce a large enrollment spike by the middle of the month .","The approach the Obama administration has taken to fixing Healthcare.gov is incremental. They identified hundreds of ""punch list"" items (read: screwed up things) and set about fixing them in a logical order, which has at times revealed new problems that they've then added to the list.

In just under two weeks, though, the media and the law's critics will treat Dec. 1 as a sort of unofficial relaunch date -- as if the administration had taken the website down when it realized the extent of the problems and was only planning on relaunching once it was fully fixed.

That's totally understandable. The administration announced a time frame for fixing the site, and has said over and over that it will be working as intended ""for the vast majority of users"" by the end of November. The implication is that people should withhold judgment until the the beginning of December and then give it a second look.

So what should we expect on Dec. 1?

Administration officials have been intentionally vague about what they mean by ""vast majority"" and whether non-consumer facing parts of the system -- particularly the channel that transmits enrollee data to insurers -- will be in good shape. But over the weekend an anonymous official told the Washington Post, ""vast majority"" means 80 percent of users.

Let's start with the fact that 20 percent is still a pretty big fail rate, before looking at who the 20 percent are.

There are two ways to look at -- and thus two ways to spin -- the 80/20 goal, two months after the initial rollout, which barely worked for anyone. The first is that it'll almost certainly still leave tons of people dissatisfied, and that's not good enough to constitute ""success.""

The second is that it'll allow millions of people to enroll quickly and it'll do a decent job reducing the pent-up demand for benefits. If it had been working for 80 percent of users on day one, or if the administration had made it 80 percent of the way toward its goal of enrolling 500,000 people in private insurance in the first month, we'd be looking at a much different political and legislative landscape than we are right now.

But as Josh Marshall notes here, an awful lot depends on who those 20 percent are, and what the Healthcare.gov experience will be like for them.

It turns out not to be quite as black and white as an 80/20 dichotomy would suggest.

Back to the Post:

According to a government official familiar with the new target, the 20 percent who are unlikely to be able to enroll online are expected to fall into three groups: people whose family circumstances are so complicated that the Web site cannot determine their eligibility for subsidies to help pay for health plans; people uncomfortable buying insurance on a computer; and people who encounter technical problems on the Web site.

I think the key questions here are what portion of the 20 percent will encounter technical problems, and will they be as intractable as the problems consumers were encountering in early October?

Advertisement:

If it's a smallish* (*scientific term) fraction of the 20 percent, then the people for whom the site doesn't work will be a mix of technophobes (people who wouldn't be using the site even if its error rate was zero) and people with complex finances, family situations, etc. Of course, a lot of people have complex finances and family situations. And even though many of them will be used to the logistical difficulties that arise from their circumstances, one of HHS' key goals must be to isolate those people and figure out how to make their experiences as user-friendly as possible. Not an easy task, but doable, and an easier, singular problem to contend with.

But if it's the reverse, then a large group of people will encounter frustrating error messages, and it will be much easier for Obamacare opponents to flood reporters' in boxes with screen grabs conveying the site's failures. In that case, anecdata will dominate the coverage in early December both because reporters love failure, and because they'll find it easier to pass along 404 error images than to vet any of the thousands of success stories the law's supporters will highlight.

Either way, I think it's fair to assume that the first couple of weeks after Dec. 1 will still be bumpy ones for Obamacare. The ""reboot"" won't be a dramatic inflection point. That point will only come if the fixes are adequate to move hundreds of thousands of people past the choke points, through the system and announce a large enrollment spike by the middle of the month.",www.salon.com,left,8ncPtFEiyfPmBcJ8

WASHINGTON — A chance encounter between two senators on an airplane last month in Maine may be the catalyst for a breakthrough on health care reform.

Since that Sunday afternoon meeting at the Bangor Airport, Florida Democrat Bill Nelson and Maine Republican Susan Collins have been talking to each other about ways of finding a solution on an issue that has deeply divided Congress along party lines.

There's no grand bargain in sight, but a low-key dinner the two organized for a bipartisan clutch of senators at a Washington restaurant Wednesday night suggests at least a few lawmakers are trying to find a way out of the partisan gridlock.

That effort took on added significance following the stunning defeat early Friday morning of a Republican bill to do away with some parts of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, leaving lawmakers scrambling to decide the best way to move forward on health care reform.

The deciding vote was cast by Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain. He had implored colleagues to reach a bipartisan solution during a stirring floor speech he delivered Tuesday, just days after a brain cancer diagnosis.

The following night, Nelson and Collins hosted the dinner at NoPa Kitchen, an American brasserie steps from the International Spy Museum.

The attendees included key Senate moderates such as Republicans Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mike Rounds of South Dakota, and Democrats Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Mark Warner of Virginia and Joe Manchin of West Virginia.

Collins and Murkowski joined McCain as the only three Republicans to vote against the bill, which died 51-49.

""It was a good first start and everyone (at the dinner) pretty well knows that the path that we're on is not going to be the ultimate solution,"" Nelson said Thursday before the bill was killed.

Collins sounded a similar theme following Friday's vote.

""We need to reconsider our approach,"" she said in a statement posted on her Twitter account. ""The ACA is flawed and in portions of the country is near collapse. Rather than engaging in partisan exercises, Republicans and Democrats should work together to address these very serious problems.""

Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer said he spoke with GOP House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin on Friday about working together.

“There’s a thirst to do it,” Schumer said. “I just hope the magic moment of John McCain last night has lasting effect and makes us work together in a better way and both sides are to blame for the past.”

Nelson has already introduced a bill to that effect after a Congressional Budget Office analysis concluded it would lower health care premiums 13% in Florida alone.

The more they talked, the more they realized they could work on other aspects of health care reform given the political stalemate between party leaders.

""We said let's do this together,"" Nelson said. ""That led to Susan taking the initiative and inviting everybody that was there to get their ideas.""

A reinsurance fund was one ideas that was discussed over dinner, he said. So were ways to address cost-sharing reductions that go to help low-income Americans on the individual health care market pay for coverage. The goal was finding ways to stabilize the health insurance markets, he said.

Manchin touted the reinsurance proposal on the Senate floor Thursday. And McCaskill said lawmakers need to act now to ensure people have someplace they can buy insurance next year.

You could be forgiven for having lost track of the latest in Obamacare lawsuit news , which now involves conservative states suing a federal government that agrees with them , and several former legal critics of the health law weighing in against the latest legal attack . Let 's see if we can sort it out a bit .
To recap : In 2012 , the Obama administration , following some congressional findings related to the text of the Affordable Care Act , defended the law 's individual mandate all the way to the Supreme Court by saying that it was not separable from the rest of the law . Chief Justice John Roberts , after privately flirting with signing on to a decision that invalidated the mandate , eventually penned a ruling upholding the mandate—but only as a tax penalty that raised revenue rather than as a compulsory purchase .
In 2015 , another suit , launched based in part on arguments made by Case Western Reserve Law Professor Jonathan Adler and Cato Institute Health Policy Scholar Michael Cannon , challenged the legality of the subsidies for most of the law 's exchanges ; once again , Roberts wrote an opinion upholding the law .
In 2017 , however , the GOP Congress , following several months of failed efforts to repeal the health law and replace it with some other health care legislation , passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( TCJA ) , which reduced the individual mandate tax penalty to zero . In theory , the command to purchase insurance remained on the books . In practice , it was utterly toothless .
This legislation , however , gave rise to a new lawsuit , in which a group of conservative states , led by Texas , argued that because the individual mandate was only constitutional as a revenue-raising tax , the mandate—which , as a result of the tax law , raised no tax revenue—was now unconstitutional . Furthermore , they argued , because the congressional findings related to the original Affordable Care Act indicated that the law could not stand without the mandate , the entire law should be struck down .
Somewhat surprisingly , last December , a District Judge in Texas agreed , and so , in turn , did the Trump administration , which took the rather unusual step of declining to defend any part of the law . Complicating things further , conservative legal scholars who had backed previous cases against Obamacare—including Cannon and Adler—were aggressively critical of the Texas-led suit .
To top it all off , there have been lingering questions about whether anyone , on either side of the case , has standing to challenge or defend the law at all . The toothless mandate caused no obvious injury to the red states challenging the law : Who is harmed by a mandate that penalizes no one ? Yet if the administration declined to defend it in court , agreeing with the challengers that it should be struck down , would n't that mean that both sides of the suit were , in fact , on the same side ? Lawyers from blue states who want to preserve Obamacare , plus the House of Representatives , argued the case for leaving the law in place .
And that , more or less , brings us to where we are now . Like so many television shows in their later seasons , the Obamacare legal battle appears to have lost the plot . Yet it continues .
In a nearly two hour hearing yesterday , a three-judge panel in the 5th U.S . Circuit of Appeals heard arguments about nearly all of this . Only two of the judges , both GOP appointees , asked questions , but they gave the distinct impression that they might be willing to invalidate the mandate .
As for the rest of the law , which the lower court tossed along with the penalty , it was unclear . Much was made of the question of `` severability '' —as in , whether discrete components of the law can be severed from the whole—and what Congress intended and when . Judge Kurt Engelhardt seemed resistant to the idea that the courts should be asked to slice and dice congressional statutes . Why could n't Congress address these issues on its own , and leave the court to decide other things ? A fair enough question but , in some sense , Congress did exactly that by eliminating the mandate penalty while leaving the rest of the law unchanged . Messy or not , that is the resolution that the 2017 Congress arrived at , and that is the law as it stands .
The outcome of these sorts of cases can be difficult to gauge from oral arguments , but after listening to the oral arguments , it sounded to me as if the judges were at least open to the idea of tossing out all of Obamacare along with the mandate .
Which is , I think , a mistake . I have spent nearly a decade arguing that Obamacare is bad policy , but like Adler and Cannon , I think the Texas suit goes much too far . The zeroed-out mandate should be struck down ; in its current form , it is hard to see how it is constitutional , since Roberts ' ruling allowed it only as a tax that raised revenue .
But as for the question of whether the rest of the law should go too , I continue to think that the Texas argument is an overreach and that the Trump administration has erred in declining to defend the law .
It 's true that the Democratic Congress that passed the law ( and later the Obama administration ) believed that the mandate was closely linked to the policy scheme of the original statute . But the operative question is n't what Congress believed in 2010 when the law was passed , or what the Obama administration argued in 2012 ; it 's what Congress intended in 2017 when amending the statute . And it is exceedingly clear , both from the relevant statutory text , which zeroes out the mandate penalty while leaving the rest of the law intact , and the relevant legislative and political history ( the Obamacare repeal effort failed , multiple Republicans said they intended to eliminate the mandate penalty , not the whole law ) , that the 2017 Congress intended to eliminate the mandate penalty and nothing else . There is no ███ to believe that the elimination of the mandate penalty was , as one of the judges suggested today , a sneaky backdoor plot to get rid of the rest of the law via the courts . It was an effort to remove the mandate penalty—and that 's it .
It is also difficult , at this point , to make a convincing case that the mandate is an essential part of the law since it is no longer enforceable in any way . It is an empty provision , one that was effectively repealed by the tax bill , just as the 2017 Congress intended . It was reasonable to think of it as essential in , say , 2012 , and had the mandate been stricken then , the rest of the law would have been called into question .
But in the aftermath of the TCJA , it is , in the current legislative schema , obviously inessential . To strike down the entire law now would be to assume that the 2017 Congress did not know what it was doing when it declined to repeal the entire statute and instead got rid of the mandate penalty alone ; it would be to ignore both clear congressional intent and the plain text and meaning of the law as it now stands .
In the meantime , it is troubling that the Trump administration has declined to defend the law in court . While this sort of decision is not entirely unprecedented , it is certainly unusual , and it suggests that the administration has adopted a pick-and-choose sensibility to the federal laws that the executive branch is charged with upholding . Declining to defend a law is a close cousin to declining to enforce or implement a law , and it is worrying when an administration does so , regardless of the issue , and regardless of the partisan incentives involved . The job of the executive is n't to uphold the laws the president likes ; it 's to uphold the law , period .
None of this makes Obamacare good policy or good law . But it is the law , and consequently , both the courts and the executive branch should treat it with the seriousness it deserves .
Whatever happens with the current appeal , it 's likely that the case will end up at the Supreme Court , again , with Chief Justice Roberts overseeing its fate , again . And that could happen as early as next summer , on the eve of a major election .
You can expect Democrats to make hay of this and attempt to use it to their political advantage . Indeed , they already are , with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ( D–N.Y . ) hosting a press conference this week to draw attention to the case . That may well work , given how effective the Democrats ' health care argument was during the 2018 midterm elections . And if it does , Republicans will only have themselves to blame . The GOP has spent most of the last decade backing themselves into an increasingly small corner on health care policy , so that their position amounts to little more than pointing to Obamacare and saying , `` not that . '' They squandered an opportunity to both pass and make the case for a real alternative in 2017 , and that failure is now likely to haunt them . When asked what they will do if the court overturns the law , it 's unlikely that they will have answers—or at least not good ones .","Nearly a decade after the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the health law is still tied up in the courts.

Complicating things further, conservative legal scholars who had backed previous cases against Obamacare—including Cannon and Adler—were aggressively critical of the Texas-led suit.

To top it all off, there have been lingering questions about whether anyone, on either side of the case, has standing to challenge or defend the law at all. The toothless mandate caused no obvious injury to the red states challenging the law: Who is harmed by a mandate that penalizes no one? Yet if the administration declined to defend it in court, agreeing with the challengers that it should be struck down, wouldn't that mean that both sides of the suit were, in fact, on the same side? Lawyers from blue states who want to preserve Obamacare, plus the House of Representatives, argued the case for leaving the law in place.

And that, more or less, brings us to where we are now. Like so many television shows in their later seasons, the Obamacare legal battle appears to have lost the plot. Yet it continues.

In a nearly two hour hearing yesterday, a three-judge panel in the 5th U.S. Circuit of Appeals heard arguments about nearly all of this. Only two of the judges, both GOP appointees, asked questions, but they gave the distinct impression that they might be willing to invalidate the mandate.

As for the rest of the law, which the lower court tossed along with the penalty, it was unclear. Much was made of the question of ""severability""—as in, whether discrete components of the law can be severed from the whole—and what Congress intended and when. Judge Kurt Engelhardt seemed resistant to the idea that the courts should be asked to slice and dice congressional statutes. Why couldn't Congress address these issues on its own, and leave the court to decide other things? A fair enough question but, in some sense, Congress did exactly that by eliminating the mandate penalty while leaving the rest of the law unchanged. Messy or not, that is the resolution that the 2017 Congress arrived at, and that is the law as it stands.

The outcome of these sorts of cases can be difficult to gauge from oral arguments, but after listening to the oral arguments, it sounded to me as if the judges were at least open to the idea of tossing out all of Obamacare along with the mandate.

Which is, I think, a mistake. I have spent nearly a decade arguing that Obamacare is bad policy, but like Adler and Cannon, I think the Texas suit goes much too far. The zeroed-out mandate should be struck down; in its current form, it is hard to see how it is constitutional, since Roberts' ruling allowed it only as a tax that raised revenue.

But as for the question of whether the rest of the law should go too, I continue to think that the Texas argument is an overreach and that the Trump administration has erred in declining to defend the law.

It's true that the Democratic Congress that passed the law (and later the Obama administration) believed that the mandate was closely linked to the policy scheme of the original statute. But the operative question isn't what Congress believed in 2010 when the law was passed, or what the Obama administration argued in 2012; it's what Congress intended in 2017 when amending the statute. And it is exceedingly clear, both from the relevant statutory text, which zeroes out the mandate penalty while leaving the rest of the law intact, and the relevant legislative and political history (the Obamacare repeal effort failed, multiple Republicans said they intended to eliminate the mandate penalty, not the whole law), that the 2017 Congress intended to eliminate the mandate penalty and nothing else. There is no reason to believe that the elimination of the mandate penalty was, as one of the judges suggested today, a sneaky backdoor plot to get rid of the rest of the law via the courts. It was an effort to remove the mandate penalty—and that's it.

It is also difficult, at this point, to make a convincing case that the mandate is an essential part of the law since it is no longer enforceable in any way. It is an empty provision, one that was effectively repealed by the tax bill, just as the 2017 Congress intended. It was reasonable to think of it as essential in, say, 2012, and had the mandate been stricken then, the rest of the law would have been called into question.

But in the aftermath of the TCJA, it is, in the current legislative schema, obviously inessential. To strike down the entire law now would be to assume that the 2017 Congress did not know what it was doing when it declined to repeal the entire statute and instead got rid of the mandate penalty alone; it would be to ignore both clear congressional intent and the plain text and meaning of the law as it now stands.

In the meantime, it is troubling that the Trump administration has declined to defend the law in court. While this sort of decision is not entirely unprecedented, it is certainly unusual, and it suggests that the administration has adopted a pick-and-choose sensibility to the federal laws that the executive branch is charged with upholding. Declining to defend a law is a close cousin to declining to enforce or implement a law, and it is worrying when an administration does so, regardless of the issue, and regardless of the partisan incentives involved. The job of the executive isn't to uphold the laws the president likes; it's to uphold the law, period.

None of this makes Obamacare good policy or good law. But it is the law, and consequently, both the courts and the executive branch should treat it with the seriousness it deserves.

Whatever happens with the current appeal, it's likely that the case will end up at the Supreme Court, again, with Chief Justice Roberts overseeing its fate, again. And that could happen as early as next summer, on the eve of a major election.

You can expect Democrats to make hay of this and attempt to use it to their political advantage. Indeed, they already are, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D–N.Y.) hosting a press conference this week to draw attention to the case. That may well work, given how effective the Democrats' health care argument was during the 2018 midterm elections. And if it does, Republicans will only have themselves to blame. The GOP has spent most of the last decade backing themselves into an increasingly small corner on health care policy, so that their position amounts to little more than pointing to Obamacare and saying, ""not that."" They squandered an opportunity to both pass and make the case for a real alternative in 2017, and that failure is now likely to haunt them. When asked what they will do if the court overturns the law, it's unlikely that they will have answers—or at least not good ones.",www.reason.com,right,eU8em03N1w9BmsO3

That leaves the administration with two jobs ahead of the deadline Saturday when the federal Obamacare enrollment website is supposed to be fixed — or at least useable for most Americans. They’ll tiptoe to avoid declaring victory on the site too soon, but still give those vulnerable Democrats something to seize.

There’s no way the administration could declare victory anyway, since it just suffered the embarrassment of another “what now?” announcement the day before Thanksgiving — the one-year delay of online enrollment for small businesses in federally run health insurance exchanges. Instead, it will just have to make the most of whatever improvements it can show in the enrollment website for individuals.

And yet, some Democrats aren’t even waiting for whatever scraps of progress the administration can give them — because as long as the website has been sputtering, they say they haven’t been able to brag about the Affordable Care Care benefits that are actually working, like better Medicare prescription drug coverage for seniors.

“The website should have been working for all consumers and small businesses on October 1. The fact that that didn’t happen is inexcusable,” said Rep. Carol Shea-Porter of New Hampshire, who’s expected to face one of the toughest House re-election races next year.

So what can President Barack Obama and other administration officials give those Democrats, especially the ones in close reelection races next year, while still stepping carefully around the “Mission Accomplished” trap? Expect to hear a few technical metrics of speed and lower error rates over and over again, plus one fuzzy broad theme: It’s better than it was.

“The website’s working continually better, so check it out,” Obama said Tuesday in a speech at DreamWorks Animation in California.

Jeff Zients, the leader of the administration’s tech surge, insists the website will work smoothly for “the vast majority of Americans” by the end of November — but most of the promises aren’t even that specific anymore.

These days, they’re just saying the website is “getting better,” working “pretty well,” better than it was in October — anything that doesn’t suggest it’s all fixed.

“It’s actually starting to work pretty well now, and it’s going to be working even better in the coming weeks,” Obama said at a Democratic fundraiser in California on Monday.

HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told state and local leaders in a conference call Tuesday that the site is “currently working much better” and that “we are definitely on track to have a significantly different user experience by the end of this month.”

With less than eight weeks to go before the official launch of the new health care marketplaces under the federal health law, backers of the law are ramping up to encourage people to sign up.

But there's another effort gearing up this month as well. Opponents of the health care law are making one last-ditch effort to run Obamacare off the rails before it gets fully implemented.

Probably the most aggressive effort is coming from FreedomWorks, a conservative advocacy group. It's urging people, particularly young people, not to sign up for health insurance.

""They can skip the exchange, pay the fine, and in doing that, do what's best for them financially, and we hope help hasten the collapse of Obamacare,"" said Dean Clancy, the group's vice president for policy.

FreedomWorks has also created a bit of civil disobedience theater as part of its campaign — inviting people to symbolically burn (fictional) Obamacare insurance cards. Of course there is no such thing as an Obamacare card. But that's not a problem. FreedomWorks is making its own, and distributing them.

""We're going to be holding burnings around the country,"" said Clancy. ""Without burning anything down,"" he's quick to add. ""It's all peaceful and lawful.""

Clancy says the idea is to harken back to the days of the Vietnam War, when protesters burned their draft cards — a federal crime that got many sent to prison.

""The individual mandate at the heart of Obamacare is a lot like a military draft,"" he said. And if enough young people resist the health law the way they resisted the war, ""then Washington will get the signal, we'll be able to reopen this law, and we'll be able to push for patient centered reforms that really help people get the coverage they need.""

FreedomWorks isn't the only conservative group aiming squarely at the young demographic considered so key to making the health law work, though. (Young people are necessary to ensure the exchanges aren't overloaded with older, sicker patients.)

YG Network YouTube

Another GOP advocacy group called the YGNetwork — YG stands for young guns — is out with a TV ad that's been airing on youth-oriented programs like Saturday Night Live.

It pokes fun at the Obama administration's efforts to promote the law by showing a frustrated group of advertising executives around a table, trying to figure out how to sell a product that's not very popular.

YGNetwork spokesman Chris Bond says the ad is ""simply drawing attention to the fact that they're using taxpayer money in this cynical marketing effort rather than fixing the law so that it doesn't hurt Americans.""

But not all the effort to stop the law in its tracks is being aimed at the young. Heritage Action, the advocacy arm of the Heritage Foundation, is launching a nine-city Defund Obamacare Town Hall Tour starting later this month.

Democrats promise trillions in savings. Republicans swear the law will bankrupt the country.

Alright, whatever. Here's what nonpartisan experts have said.

Will it reduce deficits or not? When the Affordable Care Act passed in March 2010, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that it would reduce deficits by more than $100 billion in the first decade, and by considerably more in the second decade -- by half a percent of economic growth. A half percent of GDP over a decade could mean reducing deficits by more than $1 trillion.

So, what's the problem? The CBO's estimate assumes that the law would be adhered to exactly as written.

Except that almost never happens with big legislation.

The CBO itself noted that the ACA would ""put into effect a number of policies that might be difficult to sustain over a long period of time.""

A number of changes have already been made, and more are being proposed -- some of which could diminish the law's deficit-reduction potential.

For instance, there's a push to repeal Obamacare's tax on medical devices. The tax is expected to raise about $30 billion over the next decade.

And there is concern that Congress could have a hard time adhering to various cost containment provisions in the law, said Joshua Gordon, policy director of the Concord Coalition, a deficit watchdog group.

If lawmakers keep messing with the law, then what? It depends on what they do -- but they could end up adding to deficits.

What if, for instance, they phase out key provisions intended to restrain spending growth in Medicare and don't implement a policy to slow the growth of health insurance subsidies?

Related: Is Obamacare slowing healthcare spending?

The Government Accountability Office did a long-range simulation that included these and other assumptions about the broader budget.

In such a scenario, the GAO found that deficits would go up 0.7% of GDP over the next 75 years. That would be due in large part to increased spending on Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program and subsidies offered on the health insurance exchanges.

When will we know who's right? It may be awhile. Obamacare is a very complex law with lots of moving parts that phase in (and out) over time.

Already, growth in national health spending -- of which federal spending is a big part -- has fallen to a record low rate. The CBO and economists think part of that slowing is attributable directly or indirectly to the ACA, but it's unclear how much. And the growth rate is expected to rise in the next few years as more people become insured under Obamacare.

It also remains to be seen whether the new health insurance exchanges will draw a diverse pool of enrollees and generate enough competition to fulfill the law's promise of providing affordable health care for most Americans.

What makes Gordon optimistic that Obamacare can help improve the country's fiscal outlook long-term are the changes that hospitals, doctors and insurance companies are already making in attempts to slow cost growth.

""Underneath this surface fight over Obamacare, there's a huge amount of change and consensus on different ways to slow down health care costs and shift to a value-based health care system,"" Gordon said.

Reality : Heritage Foundation Study Fails To Take Into Account Cost-Saving Subsidies
Huffington Post : “ The Heritage Analysis Is Deceptive Because It Does Not Factor In Substantial Premium Subsidies. ” According to an op-ed by Ethan Rome , executive director of Health Care for America Now , on the Huffington Post , the Heritage Foundation study is flawed because it does not factor in tax credits that many exchange customers will access to make coverage more affordable :
The Heritage analysis is deceptive because it does not factor in the substantial premium subsidies most consumers will receive to help them pay for their insurance . Heritage simply pretends these subsidies , in the form of tax credits , do not exist . Leaving out the most important factor in this equation is precisely how the “ Heritage Health Insurance Microsimulation Model ” reached a conclusion that supports the political agenda of Republican extremists who can think of no domestic policy other than attacking the ACA . Unlike Heritage , consumers wo n't pretend the tax credits do n't exist . The premium subsidies are a big reason ACA coverage will be affordable . For example , while the premium for a particular plan may be $ 241 a month , the cost to the consumer after applying the tax credit may be only $ 143 a month . That 's a huge difference . [ Huffington Post , 10/21/13 ]
Tax Credits Will Help A Majority Of Uninsured Exchange Shoppers And Should Be Included In Cost Calculations . According to Talking Points Memo , tax credits should be included in premium cost calculations because they will be provided to a majority of those shopping for insurance on the exchanges :
Under Obamacare , the sticker price for insurance is n't what most people are going to actually pay . The law offers tax credits , on a sliding scale , for people making between 100 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level . According to estimates from the Kaiser Family Foundation , more than half of uninsured Americans have an income within that range . Another 38 percent fall below the poverty line . They are supposed to be eligible for Medicaid under the law , and millions in poverty will be covered that way . However , more than 20 Republican states -- with an assist from the U.S. Supreme Court -- have refused to expand Medicaid coverage to them . So people in those states are admittedly out of luck , but that was n't the ACA 's intention . That leaves only 10 percent of uninsured Americans who make above 400 percent of the poverty level and , as the law was conceived , would be paying the premiums that Heritage highlights in its analysis .

Watchdog.org : “ Some Pretty Good Evidence That Young People Would n't Be Flocking To The Exchanges ” Even If They Worked . Watchdog.org claimed there were indications that young people would not sign up for the ACA on the exchanges due to rising costs :
But there already is some pretty good evidence that young people would n't be flocking to the exchanges even if they were in good working order . And that 's a big deal , because the arithmetic behind Obamacare requires that lots of young , relatively healthy people buy insurance and effectively subsidize the cost of the older , less healthy , more expensive people in the system . As Cathy Reisenwitz wrote last week , this is why the whole scheme should n't be called insurance at all - because it 's really cost-pooling .

CNN Money : “ Only 5 % Of [ Millennials ] Claim They Do Not Want Or Need Health Insurance. ” According to an October 21 CNN Money op-ed piece by Matthew Segal , president of OurTime.org , a group dedicated to enhancing the voice of young Americans , polls have found that only 5 percent of young people say they do not want or need health insurance :
There are currently 17 million uninsured Millennials now eligible to get health insurance through the Affordable Care Act . Only 5 % of them claim they do not want or need health insurance , according to some polls . In other words , despite what the opt-out crusaders might lead you to believe , young people are n't so foolish to think they will never get sick , fall down , become pregnant , develop a food allergy , or face any other spur-of the moment illness , which can cost thousands of dollars . Let 's not forget that more than 50 % of all personal bankruptcies in the pre-Obamacare world were due to unforeseen medical expenses . [ CNN Money , 10/21/13 ]
The Washington Post : “ 90 Percent Of Uninsured Young Adults Will Qualify For [ ACA 's ] More Generous Subsidies. ” According to Washington Post 's Wonkblog , 90 percent of uninsured young adults will qualify for tax credits :
To start , about 90 percent of uninsured young adults will qualify for the law 's more generous subsidies . Census data shows there are about 11 million Americans between 20 and 29 . Eight-seven percent of them have incomes below 400 percent of the federal poverty line , meaning they will qualify for some level of a tax subsidy or for the Medicaid program . The bar on the far left represents the 4.83 million young adults who earn less than 138 percent of the federal poverty line and will become eligible for Medicaid . That entitlement program does not use the age rating provisions used in the private market , meaning that one-third of young adults wo n't interact with this part of Obamacare in any way . The three bars in the middle show young adults who will become eligible for subsidies under the Affordable Care Act . Those subsidies will cap the young adults spending on health insurance as a percent of income . Let 's take an individual who earns $ 22,240 , which works out to 200 percent of the poverty line . That person would get enough tax subsidies so that , at most , he was spending $ 1,407 annually on health insurance ( a $ 117 monthly premium ) . [ The Washington Post , 2/11/13 ]
MSNBC : Choosing To Pay The Penalty Instead Of Purchasing Insurance Makes Little Financial Sense . An August 9 MSNBC piece on the benefits of younger , healthy Americans purchasing insurance explained that most young Americans will qualify for subsidies to make their insurance more affordable and that passing on a health care plan could leave them subject to “ financial ruin ” if they need serious medical care :
Obamacare also uses tax credits to discount most young people 's coverage . Anyone with an income between 100 % and 400 % of the federal poverty level ( $ 11,490 to $ 45,960 in 2013 ) -- which is to say the vast majority of healthy young adults -- will benefit accordingly . In Los Angeles , a 25-year-old man earning $ 17,235 will pay $ 34 per month for silver-level coverage next year . That 's 80 % less than the same coverage would cost without the discount ( $ 174 per month ) . Suppose that young man heeds the FreedomWorks call to action .

Or he can pay $ 34 for a health plan that provides ready access to primary care and could spare him financial ruin if he suffers a serious illness or injury . “ It usually costs a little more to buy the plan than pay the penalty , ” says Jay Angoff , the Washington-based attorney who oversaw the initial rollout of Obamacare for the Department of Health and Human Services . “ But if you look at what you 're getting in return , there 's no contest . For most people , paying an extra few bucks a month to get health insurance is the rational choice. ” [ MSNBC , 8/9/13 , emphasis added ]
Watchdog.org : Because Of The ACA , “ People May Have A Pretty Good Incentive To Avoid Things Like Marriage And Job Promotions That Pay Them A Higher Salary. ” According to Watchdog.org , the way subsidies are structured under the ACA -- higher subsidies for individuals making less income -- will encourage people to avoid getting married and combining incomes :
Because of how the subsidies in the Affordable Care Act are structured , people may have a pretty good incentive to avoid things like marriage and job promotions that pay them a higher salary . [ ... ] “ The tax credits in Obamacare are structured in such a manner that a newly married couple may be surprised by a huge tax bill , due to the marriage penalty in the law , ” said Josh Archambault , a senior fellow with the foundation . “ The couple will be making no additional money , but their marriage certificate paper can result in a multi-thousand dollar drop in their credit. ” [ Watchdog.org 10/22/13 ]
Reality : Subsidies Are Targeted To Uninsured Individuals Because Married Couples Are More Likely To Have Coverage
Think Progress : ACA Will Not Deter Marriage Because Individuals Have Often Gained Coverage Through Marriage . According to Think Progress , providing subsidies for coverage to individuals makes sense because they are more likely to be uninsured , while married couples “ benefit from economies of scale ” and are more likely to have insurance :
The affordability credits are pegged to the federal poverty guidelines , which treat married people as a unit and view individuals as separate parties filing separate tax returns . These guidelines assume , as Judith Solomon points out , that “ people benefit from economies of scale when they 're living together ” and recognizes that unmarried individuals have fewer resources ( lower incomes , more money spent on basic necessities ) than married families . In fact , since the majority of the uninsured are not married and marrying lowers uninsurance rates , providing more subsidies to individuals is a better way of targeting affordability credits to those who need them most . [ Think Progress , 10/27/11 ]
Married People Are More Likely To Have Insurance Than Single People . According to 2009 Census data compiled by Think Progress , married individuals are more likely to have insurance when compared to single people .
New Republic : Married People Receiving The Same Benefits As Single People Would Give Couples A Distinct Advantage . According to the New Republic , fixing the “ marriage glitch ” by making subsidies consistent across marital status would penalize single people compounding the economic advantages of cohabitation and ignores the reality that single people have more trouble affording health care :","Myth #1: Premium Costs Will Rise Across The Country

Or he can pay $34 for a health plan that provides ready access to primary care and could spare him financial ruin if he suffers a serious illness or injury. “It usually costs a little more to buy the plan than pay the penalty,” says Jay Angoff, the Washington-based attorney who oversaw the initial rollout of Obamacare for the Department of Health and Human Services. “But if you look at what you're getting in return, there's no contest. For most people, paying an extra few bucks a month to get health insurance is the rational choice.” [MSNBC, 8/9/13, emphasis added]

Myth #3: Structure Of ACA Subsidies Will Deter Marriage

Watchdog.org: Because Of The ACA, “People May Have A Pretty Good Incentive To Avoid Things Like Marriage And Job Promotions That Pay Them A Higher Salary.” According to Watchdog.org, the way subsidies are structured under the ACA -- higher subsidies for individuals making less income -- will encourage people to avoid getting married and combining incomes:

Because of how the subsidies in the Affordable Care Act are structured, people may have a pretty good incentive to avoid things like marriage and job promotions that pay them a higher salary. [...] “The tax credits in Obamacare are structured in such a manner that a newly married couple may be surprised by a huge tax bill, due to the marriage penalty in the law,” said Josh Archambault, a senior fellow with the foundation. “The couple will be making no additional money, but their marriage certificate paper can result in a multi-thousand dollar drop in their credit.” [Watchdog.org 10/22/13]

Reality: Subsidies Are Targeted To Uninsured Individuals Because Married Couples Are More Likely To Have Coverage

Think Progress: ACA Will Not Deter Marriage Because Individuals Have Often Gained Coverage Through Marriage. According to Think Progress, providing subsidies for coverage to individuals makes sense because they are more likely to be uninsured, while married couples “benefit from economies of scale” and are more likely to have insurance:

The affordability credits are pegged to the federal poverty guidelines, which treat married people as a unit and view individuals as separate parties filing separate tax returns. These guidelines assume, as Judith Solomon points out, that “people benefit from economies of scale when they're living together” and recognizes that unmarried individuals have fewer resources (lower incomes, more money spent on basic necessities) than married families. In fact, since the majority of the uninsured are not married and marrying lowers uninsurance rates, providing more subsidies to individuals is a better way of targeting affordability credits to those who need them most. [Think Progress, 10/27/11]

Married People Are More Likely To Have Insurance Than Single People. According to 2009 Census data compiled by Think Progress, married individuals are more likely to have insurance when compared to single people.

[Think Progress, 1/15/10]

New Republic: Married People Receiving The Same Benefits As Single People Would Give Couples A Distinct Advantage. According to the New Republic, fixing the “marriage glitch” by making subsidies consistent across marital status would penalize single people compounding the economic advantages of cohabitation and ignores the reality that single people have more trouble affording health care:",www.mediamatters.org,left,AGAi0sKScDVwseDl

Not anymore.

With the president’s approval ratings at record lows, a broken website and Obama under fire for his pledge that people could keep their plans, the “Affordable Care Act” has returned.

The president didn’t say “Obamacare” once during his nearly hourlong news conference last week, while he referred to the “Affordable Care Act” a dozen times. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi went so far as to correct David Gregory on “Meet the Press” Sunday on the proper terminology. And White House talking points distributed to Democrats and obtained by POLITICO repeatedly refer to the Affordable Care Act in suggested sound bites, not Obamacare.

( WATCH: Best lines from Obama’s ACA mea culpa)

Calling it the Affordable Care Act has advantages for Democrats seeking to defend health care reform while still criticizing the bungled White House rollout. The phrase polls better than Obamacare — and people have responded more positively to the law’s benefits when they haven’t been told they come from Obamacare.

“You want the law to have approval rating higher than POTUS has,” a Democratic official said Monday.

“Obamacare” started out as a pejorative term during Obama’s first campaign, and Republicans, especially the tea party, embraced it during protests and rallies against the health care bill. The media generally steered clear as well — using phrases such as “health care reform” to describe the issue.

But Obama last year reappropriated the term for himself, making the phrase a staple of his stump speech and hawking “I (heart) Obamacare” bumper stickers.

“We passed Obamacare — yes, I like the term — we passed it because I do care, and I want to put these choices in your hands where they belong,” Obama said at a typical stop in Iowa last October.

Now, the phrase is vanishing from official use. White House website posts in July (“Obamacare in Three Words: Saving People Money”) and late September (“What Obamacare Means for You”) called the health care law the O-word. But now HealthCare.gov is almost entirely scrubbed of “Obamacare” and the law is called the Affordable Care Act in nearly every instance. Health insurance exchanges run by states don’t use the term Obamacare at all.

A 22-page White House document issued to Democratic Sunday show guests uses the word Obamacare only under a “general points” subheading and in a section debunking a purported myth that increased Medicaid enrollment would lead to an older, sicker population signing up for health care through the exchanges.

Instead, the document contains standard White House health care talking points: “The Affordable Care Act is more than a website”; “We have a great product that people like and tons of interest in the product”; and Obama’s “administrative proposal will give consumers more information and choices, including keeping their old plans.”

The White House talking points suggest that Democrats respond to GOP attacks by pointing to October, when the government was shut down and Congress was staring at a potential default.

ObamaCare can only afford to extend health insurance entitlements to more people through increased taxes or penalties ( payroll tax for Medicare , individual and business mandates , tax on medical devices , etc . ) .
If the current economic climate continues , small businesses will be reluctant to add more employees and large businesses will prefer to pay the ObamaCare penalty than pay the increasing premiums .
More and more people will get their health insurances at the state exchanges , where taxes pay for federal stipends in states which have created their own exchanges .
There will be a disparity of services provided depending on your state .

ObamaCare can only afford to extend health insurance entitlements to more people through increased taxes or penalties (payroll tax for Medicare, individual and business mandates, tax on medical devices, etc.).

If the current economic climate continues, small businesses will be reluctant to add more employees and large businesses will prefer to pay the ObamaCare penalty than pay the increasing premiums.

More and more people will get their health insurances at the state exchanges, where taxes pay for federal stipends in states which have created their own exchanges.

There will be a disparity of services provided depending on your state. Medicaid expansion offered to 16 million more people will also vary depending on whether your state can afford to implement it or not. Medicaid lacks sufficient providers or networks to provide care, and the expansion makes this problem far worse.

President Obama's victory on election night is not a victory for health care, though it may be a narrow one for health insurance companies who gain more customers.

Prices will continue to rise and access to actual care will decline in an already overcrowded system.

Biotech companies and drug companies may feel that the climate is no longer ripe for innovation.

Hospitals and other health care providers will continue to struggle amid shrinking reimbursements.

Bottom line: my patients who gain a new insurance card may find that it doesn't buy them the care they were expecting.",www.foxnews.com,right,Z58g0qOKQGHwVKv9

Emmett Tyrrell, Larry Thornberry, William Murchison","President Trump ’ s recent declaration in USA Today that Medicare-for-All would “ demolish promises to seniors ” produced a deluge of denunciations from the Democrats , the media , and the plan ’ s primary congressional promoter — Bernie Sanders . The latter ’ s response to the President ’ s op-ed uses the word “ lie ” repeatedly and CNN claims Trump ’ s op-ed “ assaults the truth. ” But elderly voters should heed the President ’ s warning about the left ’ s latest health care brainstorm . Despite disingenuous promises from Sanders and his fellow travelers , it simply isn ’ t possible to implement their rebranded single-payer proposal without undermining the traditional Medicare program that most seniors rely upon for health care coverage .
But , before we get into the specific damage this ill-conceived program would inevitably cause , it ’ s useful to pause for a moment and consider that the people making grandiose promises on behalf of Medicare-for-All are the same characters who told us Obamacare would cure the various maladies afflicting American medicine . Remember when they pledged that the risibly titled “ Affordable Care Act ” was going to reduce health care costs , cover the uninsured , and improve access to care ? After eight years beneath the yoke of that misbegotten law , health care is more expensive than ever , there are still 30 million uninsured Americans , physician shortages are steadily worsening , and community hospitals are closing at the rate of one every three weeks .
In other words , the last time the Democrats “ fixed ” health care , they exacerbated every problem that bedeviled the system . Yet the very people who accomplished that dubious feat are making the same promises on behalf of Medicare-for-All that they made on behalf of Obamacare . Why would any rational voter believe them ? Anyone with an IQ exceeding single digits and the energy to spend a little time researching the well-documented failures of single-payer health care will quickly conclude that Medicare-for-All would dramatically increase the aggregate cost of medical care , reduce access to doctors and hospitals , and necessitate stealth rationing . And it will be elderly Americans who feel these negative effects most acutely .
Let ’ s begin with the cost of Medicare-for-All . Bernie Sanders writes in his response to Trump ’ s op-ed , “ Medicare is the most popular , successful and cost-effective health insurance program in the country. ” It ’ s ironic that Sanders repeatedly calls the President a liar in this piece . This single sentence contains an outrageous falsehood . I literally laughed aloud when I read his claim concerning cost-effectiveness . The most recent Medicare Trustees report indicates that the program is teetering on the brink of bankruptcy . That ’ s right , the current Medicare program — without any grandiose plan to expand it to all Americans — will go bankrupt in less than ten years if it is not dramatically reformed . This is not a complicated message :
The estimated depletion date for the HI [ Hospital Insurance ] trust fund is 2026 , 3 years earlier than in last year ’ s report . As in past years , the Trustees have determined that the fund is not adequately financed over the next 10 years.… The Trustees recommend that Congress and the executive branch work closely together with a sense of urgency to address the depletion of the HI trust fund .
Yet the same Democrats who claim they will expand Medicare steadfastly refuse to participate in any sensible plan to prevent it from going broke and vilify any policy maker who proposes such a plan . Remember that video portraying Paul Ryan throwing Granny off a cliff ? At present , Medicare covers about 50 million seniors and disabled Americans . This figure will raise the following question in the mind of any voter with a rudimentary grasp of arithmetic : How can we expand a soon-to-be insolvent program that covers 50 million into a Medicare-for-All program that covers more than 300 million ? That ’ s a question that Senator Sanders tends to avoid . This is as close as he comes to answering it in his response to President Trump :
Study after study shows that when we eliminate private insurance premiums , deductibles and co-payments , the average American will pay substantially less for health care than he or she currently pays.… Even the projections from the conservative Mercatus Center suggest that the average American could save about $ 6,000 under Medicare for All over a 10-year period .
Medicare-for-All will not , however , “ eliminate private insurance premiums , deductibles and co-payments. ” It will merely force us to pay the money in taxes to the government . And that diversion of funds will add a huge amount of deadweight loss ( the harm to economic efficiency associated with a tax ) to the overall cost of health care . As AEI scholar Christopher Conover points out in Forbes , the Sanders plan comes with a hidden cost of $ 1,900 to $ 3,400 per U.S. resident or $ 7,700 to $ 13,600 for a family of 4 ( per year ) . In other words , even after subtracting the $ 6,000 allegedly saved by the average American , Medicare-for-All would still weigh him down with an added cost of at least $ 13,000 ( $ 19,000- $ 6,000 ) over that 10-year period .
And it gets worse . Sanders ’ reference to the Mercatus Center ( which is libertarian , by the way ) leaves out its most important projections . Charles Blahous , the Senior Research Strategist who authored the study , writes , “ The Medicare-for-All Act would under conservative estimates , increase federal budget commitments by approximately $ 32.6 trillion during its first 10 years of full implementation ( 2022–2031 ) , assuming enactment in 2018. ” And that projection gives the Sanders plan the benefit of the doubt by accepting his wildly optimistic claim that health care providers will be able to remain solvent on payment rates 40 percent lower than those currently paid by private health insurance carriers . How much will that cost the taxpayers ?
[ D ] oubling all federal individual and corporate income taxes going forward would be insufficient to fully finance the plan.… Such an increase in the scope of federal government operations would precipitate a correspondingly large increase in federal taxation or debt and would be unprecedented if undertaken as an enduring federal commitment .
And this , remember , is based on conservative estimates of the program ’ s cost . According to Blahous , “ It is likely that the actual cost of [ Medicare-for- All ] would be substantially greater than has been estimated from its legislative text. ” As President Trump predicts , if payment rates to doctors and hospitals are actually held to the abstemious levels stipulated by the bill ’ s language , “ Doctors and hospitals would be put out of business . Seniors would lose access to their favorite doctors . There would be long wait lines for appointments and procedures . Previously covered care would effectively be denied. ” This is not , as Sanders would have it , a “ lie. ” It will be an inevitable consequence of the laws of economics — supply and demand .
Which brings us back to the inevitable effects of Medicare-for-All : Dramatic increases in the aggregate cost of care , reductions in access to providers , and rationing . Why will seniors feel these effects more acutely than other Americans ? They use more health care and tend to be more expensive to treat . If a physician gets paid about the same amount for treating healthy young patients as he gets paid for seniors , he will start turning away the latter . This is called “ stealth rationing ” and it is a common feature of all single-payer systems . Seniors will have to seek primary care in hospital ERs , the most expensive health care anywhere . President Trump is right . Medicare-for-All would be outrageously expensive , ageist , and immoral .","President Trump’s recent declaration in USA Today that Medicare-for-All would “demolish promises to seniors” produced a deluge of denunciations from the Democrats, the media, and the plan’s primary congressional promoter — Bernie Sanders.

Two-edged sword

With the calamitous debut of Obamacare, candidates for the chopping block would seem obvious. On Friday, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, when asked whether she'd offered her resignation, dodged the question. Perhaps President Obama is waiting for the program to enjoy a period of calm before making subordinates walk the plank. But it may be that he, like some predecessors, realizes that firings are a two-edged sword: They signal decisiveness but send a message of an administration in disarray.

People have come and gone in Obama's five years in office, but most were urged to jump rather than wait to be pushed. Both generals Stanley McChrystal and David Petraeus knew they were doomed and tendered their resignations. Early in Obama's first term, Social Secretary Desiree Rogers was urged to resign after two unauthorized guests were admitted to a state dinner, and environment adviser Van Jones stepped aside under pressure when some of his controversial writings surfaced. But not all officials who are under fire agree to face-saving devices.

A sacrificial lamb?

Bill Clinton left his first Secretary of Defense Les Aspin, who was not well suited for the job, twisting in the wind while he pondered his fate. When a military operation in Mogadishu, Somalia, in 1993, resulted in 18 U.S. soldiers killed and 73 wounded, a sacrificial lamb was needed and Aspin was the obvious choice. Trouble is Clinton couldn't bear to do it, so he delegated the task to National Security Adviser Tony Lake, who was a friend of Aspin's. But Aspin demanded a face-to-face meeting with Clinton and talked the president out of canning him — at least temporarily.

Sometimes presidents resort to extreme measures to remove a few bad apples from the Cabinet. Both Richard Nixon in 1973 and Jimmy Carter in 1979 demanded letters of resignation from their entire Cabinets. This allowed both to avoid going eyeball-to-eyeball with those members they really didn't want back.

So why is it so tough for the ""most powerful man in the world"" to boot out subordinates? Some underlings have stood by the president through the long trek to the White House. Others are supported by important constituencies. But perhaps the best explanation is that they're politicians. And politicians, as columnist Elizabeth Drew once wrote, just want to be loved by everyone. Obama is a politician. Perhaps that's why so few prominent heads have rolled for the Obamacare breakdowns.

LOUISVILLE — Although his conservative comrades in the Senate are still butting heads over a controversial health care bill, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky was optimistic about the potential for compromise Friday evening.

President Trump tweeted Friday that congressional Republicans should consider repealing the Affordable Care Act — popularly known as Obamacare — first and then work on a replacement. Kentucky's other Republican senator, Rand Paul, has expressed support for that idea.

But McConnell told reporters Friday that he and his colleagues in the Senate will stick to working on their current health care bill, which would repeal and replace the ACA simultaneously.

Speaking to a friendly crowd in Elizabethtown during a fundraiser for the Republican Party of Hardin County, McConnell compared his current predicament to holding a Rubik’s cube.

The ruling clears the way for the biggest revamp of America 's health-care system since the 1960s—and sets the stage for a renewed political fight over its merits .
By a 5-4 vote , the court held the law 's mandate requiring Americans to carry health insurance or pay a penalty valid under Congress 's constitutional authority to levy taxes . The financial penalty for failing to carry insurance possesses `` the essential feature of any tax , '' producing revenue for the government , Chief Justice Roberts wrote .
The Surprise Vote : Roberts The pivotal -- and most surprising -- vote to uphold most of the Obama administration 's health-care law came from Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts . Read more .
But the court handed a consolation prize to the 26 largely Republican-led states that challenged the health-care overhaul—and opened a new door to their resistance . It ruled that the federal government could not expel states from Medicaid if they refused to go along with the expanded eligibility for the federal-state health program that is part of the health-care law .
The decision , tensely awaited for months , proved a vast relief to Democrats and Mr. Obama .
President Barack Obama , in a White House speech , gives his reaction to today 's Supreme Court ruling on his health-care law .
Speaking at the White House , the president retold the story of a woman with cancer who had to go without insurance and said , `` Because of this law , there are other Americans … who will not have to hang their fortunes on chance . These are the Americans for whom we passed this law . ''
Live Chat Recap WSJ 's D.C. deputy bureau chief Tim Hanrahan , health policy writer Janet Adamy , and legal editor Peter Landers took reader questions a few hours after the ruling . Replay the event .
But the decision also handed Republicans a sharper message for the fall campaign : They said they would tell Americans who dislike `` Obamacare '' that electing GOP candidates is the only way to repeal it . What 's more , by calling the insurance penalty the legal equivalent of a tax , the court allows Republicans to accuse the president of raising taxes for some .

WASHINGTON—Chief Justice John Roberts joined the Supreme Court's four liberals Thursday to uphold the linchpin of President Barack Obama's plan to expand health coverage to nearly all Americans, a surprise conclusion to a constitutional showdown.

The ruling clears the way for the biggest revamp of America's health-care system since the 1960s—and sets the stage for a renewed political fight over its merits.

By a 5-4 vote, the court held the law's mandate requiring Americans to carry health insurance or pay a penalty valid under Congress's constitutional authority to levy taxes. The financial penalty for failing to carry insurance possesses ""the essential feature of any tax,"" producing revenue for the government, Chief Justice Roberts wrote.

The Surprise Vote: Roberts The pivotal -- and most surprising -- vote to uphold most of the Obama administration's health-care law came from Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts. Read more.

But the court handed a consolation prize to the 26 largely Republican-led states that challenged the health-care overhaul—and opened a new door to their resistance. It ruled that the federal government could not expel states from Medicaid if they refused to go along with the expanded eligibility for the federal-state health program that is part of the health-care law.

The decision, tensely awaited for months, proved a vast relief to Democrats and Mr. Obama.

President Barack Obama, in a White House speech, gives his reaction to today's Supreme Court ruling on his health-care law.

Speaking at the White House, the president retold the story of a woman with cancer who had to go without insurance and said, ""Because of this law, there are other Americans … who will not have to hang their fortunes on chance. These are the Americans for whom we passed this law.""

Live Chat Recap WSJ's D.C. deputy bureau chief Tim Hanrahan, health policy writer Janet Adamy, and legal editor Peter Landers took reader questions a few hours after the ruling. Replay the event.

But the decision also handed Republicans a sharper message for the fall campaign: They said they would tell Americans who dislike ""Obamacare"" that electing GOP candidates is the only way to repeal it. What's more, by calling the insurance penalty the legal equivalent of a tax, the court allows Republicans to accuse the president of raising taxes for some.

""This is now a time for the American people to make a choice,"" said presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. ""You can choose whether you want to have a larger and larger government.""

A noisy and divided crowd waited on the steps of the Supreme Court Thursday for the contentious health care law ruling. As WSJ's Neil Hickey reports, the 5-4 decision to largely uphold the Affordable Care Act was greeted with shock and celebration.

The beleaguered ObamaCare exchange system took another serious blow recently, as the large insurer Anthem announced it would be pulling out of Ohio next year, leaving about 20 counties with zero options on the exchange. They are mulling whether to stay in Missouri and Colorado — where for huge swathes of each state, they are the only option left.

The reason? President Trump.

He has been threatening to undermine the exchange system, and so Anthem is getting out of some of its shakier positions. It's an object lesson in the weakness of super-complicated programs that require frequent attention from federal authorities. The next time Democrats take a bite at the health-care policy apple, they should strongly prefer big, straightforward options like Medicare for all — which can survive much better on autopilot.

So what is Trump doing? He has threatened to cut the insurer subsidies that are built into ObamaCare, and according to Anthem, provided a highly unstable regulatory environment. In a Wall Street Journal article, the company blamed the threats about cost-sharing payments, as well as shrinking markets and ""continual changes in federal operations, rules, and guidance."" Critically, that reasoning has nothing to do with Ohio in particular, suggesting that if the chaos continues, it will likely pull out of the rest of the exchanges — throwing hundreds of thousands off their insurance and perhaps leading other insurers to bolt.

This demonstrates a rather ironic aspect of ObamaCare. The policy is politically moderate — in that it was somewhat in between what the left and right would want — but it is fairly radical policy-wise, in terms of preferring the new and experimental to the tried and true. The way that private markets allocate resources is completely at odds with how any humane person would want health-care resources allocated. As we all have witnessed over the last several years, it takes a tremendous amount of regulation and babysitting to coax functioning private insurance markets to life — and yet more effort to keep them functioning.

ObamaCare was working reasonably well. But after just a few years, it very obviously needs an overhaul. The subsidy structure is far too stingy, it countenances way too much hospital consolidation, it provides thin-to-nonexistent market options in many parts of the country, and it badly needs a public option backstop to provide options where insurers will not. On top of that, federal regulators were still working on new rules to fix problems like huge out-of-network emergency bills right up through the end of the Obama administration.

All this complexity provides two points of weakness during times of Republican government. First, Republicans might deliberately sandbag needed regulatory efforts, and semi-plausibly blame ensuing problems on bad policy design. Or, the new government may simply be too incompetent to regulate effectively, even if it wants to. Both of those things appear to be happening now. It would probably be possible to cajole or threaten Anthem into staying in the market, but Republicans — through some combination of malice and stupidity — aren't going to do it.

Either way, the result is likely to be a partial or complete collapse of the ObamaCare exchanges over the next few years — even if the Republican health-care reform bill doesn't blow them up altogether.

Medicare, by contrast, both requires far less attention from federal regulators and is far stronger politically. It does need some regulation, but not constant and endless attention just to keep from falling to pieces. And it's not a coincidence that the incomprehensibly vicious Republican health-care bill still leaves Medicare mostly intact. If you mess around with Medicare, you inspire instant enraged backlash from the most reliable voting demographic in the country.

The bill does mount an all-out assault on Medicaid, because poor people are less likely to vote, but even there Republicans have backloaded most of their cuts so they won't take effect immediately. Even someone as monstrous as Paul Ryan doesn't dare to simply delete the program at a stroke — he has to let the poison take effect over many years.

Of course, Medicare isn't completely invulnerable. But a universal single-payer program is as close as we're likely to get. Straightforward, easy-to-understand policy where the lines of responsibility are clear and the necessary regulations aren't wildly complicated or innovative is the best policy fit for the janky American state.

The second figure is highly misleading , since the category of opioids that includes the most commonly prescribed analgesics played a role in just one-fifth of those 70,000 drug-related deaths in 2017 , according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) .
Furthermore , more than 90 percent of the cases that involved prescription analgesics such as hydrocodone and oxycodone also involved other drugs , most commonly illicit opioids such as heroin and fentanyl . Even if we focus on the relatively small share of drug-related deaths that involve opioid analgesics , blaming chronic pain treatment seems misplaced , since patients who depend upon these drugs to make their lives livable are not inclined to part with them , meaning that short-term prescriptions for acute pain are more likely sources of diverted pain pills .
Even while arguing that opioids are not appropriate for treatment of chronic pain in patients who do not have cancer and are not on the verge of death , Manchin and Braun concede that sometimes they are .

Specifically , what to do about the federal health law , now that the Supreme Court has given states new options .
Republican governors in particular said they were genuinely surprised by the Supreme Court ruling . The justices declared the health law in general constitutional , but gave states the option of whether or not to dramatically expand their Medicaid programs . They 'll now get to choose whether to put most people who earn more than about $ 15,000 a year on the program or not .
`` I think a lot of us , certainly on the Republican side , believed it would be found unconstitutional . So I think it 's just added more confusion to the issue rather than settling the issue , '' said Utah Gov . Gary Herbert , `` and probably more impetus on the November election to really find out and sort out what the implications are going to be going forward . ''
Indeed , the meeting 's host , Virginia Gov . Bob McDonnell , said he was n't planning to say yet whether his state would expand its Medicaid program , even with the federal government picking up the vast majority of the costs .
`` Honestly , I do n't think it 's responsible fully for my state to make a decision now because there 's still more information we need , '' he said .
Many Democratic governors see things differently , however , including Delaware 's Jack Markell , the incoming chairman of the National Governors Association .
`` This is not political . This is a financial analysis of what does it mean to cover , in our case , an additional 30,000 people , '' he said , `` and my view — and we 're clarifying that we 're understanding it all properly — ... is that this is absolutely a good deal for Delaware taxpayers . ''
Unlike Republicans , who say the Supreme Court decision confused matters , Democrats like Maryland 's Martin O'Malley also insisted that it should have ended the debate .
`` I think most governors understand that the Supreme Court 's decision was a final and clear ruling , '' he said .
Other Democrats were less charitable . Vermont 's Peter Shumlin said some of his Republican colleagues are n't being honest by calling for the repeal of the health law on the one hand , while declining to say whether they 'll accept the federal Medicaid funding that flows from it on the other .
`` Have a spine . The American people are sick and tired of spineless politicians . [ Either ] say , ' I believe the Affordable Care Act is the wrong thing , so I will not take the loot , ' or say , ' I believe the Affordable Care Act will help my state cover uninsured Americans , grow jobs , economic opportunities , and I 'm taking the loot , ' `` Shumlin said . `` But to say , ' I 'm gon na criticize the plan , but I wo n't tell you whether I 'm taking the loot or not until after the election , ' that 's what breeds cynicism among the American people .

As governors from around the country meet this weekend in Williamsburg, Va., health care is near the top of their agenda. Specifically, what to do about the federal health law, now that the Supreme Court has given states new options.

Republican governors in particular said they were genuinely surprised by the Supreme Court ruling. The justices declared the health law in general constitutional, but gave states the option of whether or not to dramatically expand their Medicaid programs. They'll now get to choose whether to put most people who earn more than about $15,000 a year on the program or not.

""I think a lot of us, certainly on the Republican side, believed it would be found unconstitutional. So I think it's just added more confusion to the issue rather than settling the issue,"" said Utah Gov. Gary Herbert, ""and probably more impetus on the November election to really find out and sort out what the implications are going to be going forward.""

Indeed, the meeting's host, Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, said he wasn't planning to say yet whether his state would expand its Medicaid program, even with the federal government picking up the vast majority of the costs.

""Honestly, I don't think it's responsible fully for my state to make a decision now because there's still more information we need,"" he said.

Many Democratic governors see things differently, however, including Delaware's Jack Markell, the incoming chairman of the National Governors Association.

""This is not political. This is a financial analysis of what does it mean to cover, in our case, an additional 30,000 people,"" he said, ""and my view — and we're clarifying that we're understanding it all properly — ... is that this is absolutely a good deal for Delaware taxpayers.""

Unlike Republicans, who say the Supreme Court decision confused matters, Democrats like Maryland's Martin O'Malley also insisted that it should have ended the debate.

""I think most governors understand that the Supreme Court's decision was a final and clear ruling,"" he said.

Other Democrats were less charitable. Vermont's Peter Shumlin said some of his Republican colleagues aren't being honest by calling for the repeal of the health law on the one hand, while declining to say whether they'll accept the federal Medicaid funding that flows from it on the other.

""Have a spine. The American people are sick and tired of spineless politicians. [Either] say, 'I believe the Affordable Care Act is the wrong thing, so I will not take the loot,' or say, 'I believe the Affordable Care Act will help my state cover uninsured Americans, grow jobs, economic opportunities, and I'm taking the loot,' "" Shumlin said. ""But to say, 'I'm gonna criticize the plan, but I won't tell you whether I'm taking the loot or not until after the election,' that's what breeds cynicism among the American people.""

O'Malley of Maryland thinks most of those Republican governors will eventually come around and take the money for economic — if not political — reasons.

""Once the posturing of the election is past, I think that a lot of these governors are going to have a hard time going home to their doctors, nurses, hospitals and explaining to them why they are passing up an opportunity to transform these dollars into better economic uses for job creation in their states,"" he said.

As technical problems with the government's new health insurance marketplace slow the pace of sign-up, a variety of ""fixes"" have been proposed. But some of these would create their own challenges. In rough order from least to most disruptive, here are some of the ideas:

1) Fix the website on schedule

This is everyone's favorite idea. The Obama administration says it hopes to have HealthCare.gov working smoothly for most users by the end of November, though it's not clear that target will be met.

2) Use alternative government sign-up paths

A 1-800 number and enrollment by mail can save would-be customers hours in front of a frozen computer screen. But ultimately, all the enrollments have to be processed through the same computer system.

3) Direct sign-up with insurance companies

Customers can use HealthCare.gov or commercial websites to shop for coverage without a lengthy enrollment process, then contact insurers directly to sign up for coverage. For now at least, though, people who use this option will not be able to take advantage of government subsidies.

4) Extend enrollment window / delay individual mandate

If timely enrollment is not possible, there will be pressure to extend various deadlines, beyond mid-December for coverage that begins in January and beyond late March to avoid a penalty. Without the pressure of these deadlines, though, younger, healthier people may wait longer to sign up, leaving a sicker, costlier pool of patients covered and potentially driving up premiums.

5) Preserve nongrandfathered, nonconforming private plans

Lawmakers are considering options to codify the president's promise that people who like their old health insurance can keep it, even if those plans don't meet the minimum standards set by the Affordable Care Act and aren't already grandfathered in. Experts cite several potential problems with that: Those policies don't include the consumer protections of the health care law, and by siphoning off healthy customers (who were generally the only ones who qualified for coverage under the old system), this would also skew the pool covered on the exchanges, raising prices for everyone else.

6) Something else?

The White House has promised its own plan to help those whose policies have been canceled and who have not yet been able to sign up for new coverage. There's no word yet on what that plan might include, but spokesman Jay Carney says it will be announced sooner rather than later.",www.npr.org,center,LflgDva6MaEsEXAi

Number of insurers participating on exchanges varies widely ; so does the number of plans
Just because an insurer sells in a state does n't mean it sells in your part of the state
So few insurers offer plans on some of the new government health insurance exchanges that consumers in those states may pay too much or face large rate increases later , insurance experts say .
An average of eight insurers compete for business in 36 states that had exchanges run or supported by the federal government last month , the Department of Health and Human Services says . ( Idaho has since started its own exchange . ) But just because an insurer sells in a state , it does n't mean it sells in every area of a state so many residents have far fewer options .
Many state-run exchanges also have far fewer than HHS ' average , which is weighted based on the number of uninsured residents in an area . Vermont has two , Kentucky has three and Nevada and Maryland each have four .
Some insurers pulled out of the exchanges required by the Affordable Care Act as the Oct. 1 launch approached . That leaves an uneven patchwork of providers — ranging from one insurer in New Hampshire and West Virginia to 16 in New York .
The difference also leads to a wide disparity in the numbers of plans , from just seven in Alabama to 106 in Arizona , according to HHS ' analysis . But HHS spokeswoman Joanne Peters says the situation is still much better than it was before the law took effect .
`` In the past , consumers were too often denied or priced out of quality health insurance options , but thanks to the Affordable Care Act consumers will be able to choose from a number of new coverage options at a price that is affordable , '' she said in an e-mail .
About a third of insurance companies opted out of participating in the exchanges in states where they were already doing business , according to a recent report by McKinsey & Co. About half of states — which include about a third of the non-elderly insured population — will see a `` material decline '' in competitors , says McKinsey , while the other half of states will have about the same or more insurance choices on the exchanges .
`` When there are too few carriers , down the road there will be issues with rate increases that make plans unaffordable for average Americans even with rate subsidies , '' says Bryce Williams , managing director of Towers Watson Exchange Solutions , which operates private insurance exchanges for companies . `` We need competitive insurance markets in all states ( and ) multiple carriers competing hard . ''
Williams notes that most counties have five to seven insurance companies competing on Medicare plans . Competition on their exchange has held down costs and kept annual rate increases to less than 2.8 % a year , he says .
Provisions in the law , such as those that prohibit cost sharing or deductibles for preventive care , help level the playing field between states with and without a large number of insurers , some say .
`` The quality will be comparable because they have to meet a minimum threshold ( for ) the basics of the plans , '' says Georgetown senior research fellow Sabrina Corlette . `` It 's really around the pricing that competition can play a role . ''
Mary Chalmers , 62 , lives in rural California where she just has two plans to choose from even though California has 12 insurers participating on the exchange . The same `` silver '' plan costs $ 62 more a month in her hometown of San Luis Obispo than in Los Angeles . Thanks to a subsidy , however , the self-employed investor 's premium for an individual policy will drop from the $ 467 she pays now a month to about $ 100 a month .
States with just a few providers `` definitely lose the competitive effect of carriers competing against each other to drive down those costs , '' agrees David Cusano , also a senior research fellow at the Georgetown University Health Policy Institute .
`` Serving the public is not part of their mission . … They 're crunching the numbers and looking at tightening profit margins , '' she says . `` Part of that is a result of the Affordable Care Act , basically telling these insurance companies that your insurance model to attract healthy people and keep out sick people is no longer allowed .

Number of insurers participating on exchanges varies widely; so does the number of plans

Just because an insurer sells in a state doesn't mean it sells in your part of the state

So few insurers offer plans on some of the new government health insurance exchanges that consumers in those states may pay too much or face large rate increases later, insurance experts say.

An average of eight insurers compete for business in 36 states that had exchanges run or supported by the federal government last month, the Department of Health and Human Services says. (Idaho has since started its own exchange.) But just because an insurer sells in a state, it doesn't mean it sells in every area of a state so many residents have far fewer options.

Many state-run exchanges also have far fewer than HHS' average, which is weighted based on the number of uninsured residents in an area. Vermont has two, Kentucky has three and Nevada and Maryland each have four.

Some insurers pulled out of the exchanges required by the Affordable Care Act as the Oct. 1 launch approached. That leaves an uneven patchwork of providers — ranging from one insurer in New Hampshire and West Virginia to 16 in New York.

The difference also leads to a wide disparity in the numbers of plans, from just seven in Alabama to 106 in Arizona, according to HHS' analysis. But HHS spokeswoman Joanne Peters says the situation is still much better than it was before the law took effect.

""In the past, consumers were too often denied or priced out of quality health insurance options, but thanks to the Affordable Care Act consumers will be able to choose from a number of new coverage options at a price that is affordable,"" she said in an e-mail.

About a third of insurance companies opted out of participating in the exchanges in states where they were already doing business, according to a recent report by McKinsey & Co. About half of states — which include about a third of the non-elderly insured population — will see a ""material decline"" in competitors, says McKinsey, while the other half of states will have about the same or more insurance choices on the exchanges.

""When there are too few carriers, down the road there will be issues with rate increases that make plans unaffordable for average Americans even with rate subsidies,"" says Bryce Williams, managing director of Towers Watson Exchange Solutions, which operates private insurance exchanges for companies. ""We need competitive insurance markets in all states (and) multiple carriers competing hard.""

Williams notes that most counties have five to seven insurance companies competing on Medicare plans. Competition on their exchange has held down costs and kept annual rate increases to less than 2.8% a year, he says.

Provisions in the law, such as those that prohibit cost sharing or deductibles for preventive care, help level the playing field between states with and without a large number of insurers, some say.

""The quality will be comparable because they have to meet a minimum threshold (for) the basics of the plans,"" says Georgetown senior research fellow Sabrina Corlette. ""It's really around the pricing that competition can play a role.""

Mary Chalmers, 62, lives in rural California where she just has two plans to choose from even though California has 12 insurers participating on the exchange. The same ""silver"" plan costs $62 more a month in her hometown of San Luis Obispo than in Los Angeles. Thanks to a subsidy, however, the self-employed investor's premium for an individual policy will drop from the $467 she pays now a month to about $100 a month.

States with just a few providers ""definitely lose the competitive effect of carriers competing against each other to drive down those costs,"" agrees David Cusano, also a senior research fellow at the Georgetown University Health Policy Institute.

Corlette says insurers' decision are motivated by profits.

""Serving the public is not part of their mission. … They're crunching the numbers and looking at tightening profit margins,"" she says. ""Part of that is a result of the Affordable Care Act, basically telling these insurance companies that your insurance model to attract healthy people and keep out sick people is no longer allowed.""

Some insurers' approaches:

• Aetna. In May, Aetna acquired Coventry Health Care, which also had filed plans for some of the exchanges. Aetna dropped out of some states where Coventry filed plans and the reverse was true in other states.

On a combined basis, Aetna and Coventry plans will be available on a statewide basis in 10 state exchanges and in limited geographic areas in seven state exchanges. Spokesman Matthew Wiggin says the company ""narrowed in on those states where we had the right cost structure and network arrangements to meet the specific demographic needs of exchange consumers."" The result, he says, is the company's presence will deliver ""long-term profitable growth.

• Cigna. The company is selling plans on five exchanges — those in half of the states in which it sells individual plans. Spokesman Joseph Moody notes that while Cigna is a ""national leader in employee health plans,"" it only started selling plans to individuals in the last four to five years.

• HealthNet. Although it's one of the only major insurance providers that has been losing money in recent years, HealthNet is taking a different approach, offering the cheapest rates — sometimes by 25% — in Southern California, said company spokesman Brad Kieffer. HealthNet expects to see 19.4% growth in revenue in 2014, a huge jump from 2011, when growth shrank 16.2%.

""There's an absolute outcry of people at this point,"" he said.

In West Virginia, where there is also only one provider, Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield submitted its rates ""long before"" it knew the competition, spokeswoman Kristin Ash wrote in an e-mail. Prices were based on regulations and company experience, she wrote.

Some insurers said they dropped out of exchanges due to uncertainty. For Aetna, the new law could be ""materially adverse,"" the company wrote in its second-quarter SEC filing, mentioning the new Medicare requirements, individual coverage mandate, rating limits and new fees and assessments. In states that didn't expand Medicaid, enrollment could also drop, Aetna wrote.

Carriers are ""really worried"" about a sicker population purchasing plans and driving down profits, Cusano said.

West Virginia, with its single insurer, ranks 47 out of 50 in terms of health, according to the 2013 America's Health Rankings Senior Report.

Companies also may have left because of tougher regulations on pricing, quality, transparency and more, especially in state-run exchanges such as Maryland, Oregon and Rhode Island, Cusano said. Williams says New Jersey, which only have three insurers, has some of the toughest regulations in the country for insurers — and much higher rates than in nearby New York.

''","ADVERTISEMENT

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office on Tuesday released its annual budget report. Depending on your politics, it was either a vindication of ObamaCare, or a blistering case against it.

So what gives?

The report finds that ObamaCare will result in 2 million fewer American jobs by 2017, three times higher than the CBO's previous projection. That figure is projected to increase to 2.5 million by 2024.

Broadly speaking, that affirms what Republicans have claimed all along about ObamaCare costing the economy jobs. Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-Ohio) said in a statement that the ""middle class is getting squeezed in this economy, and this CBO report confirms that ObamaCare is making it worse.""

With ObamaCare sure to factor prominently in the 2014 midterms, that translates into an easy way for the GOP to attack Democrats who support the health-care law.

However, the report doesn't exactly paint ObamaCare as a ""job killer,"" the GOP's strongest accusation against it. Rather, the CBO estimates the law will shrink the labor supply — resulting in fewer net jobs per the agency's scoring — as more people use ObamaCare's perks to retire earlier or work fewer hours.

Before ObamaCare, Americans typically got insurance through their employers. But the availability of new subsidies under the law will make it easier to obtain coverage solo.

Seventy-five percent ( 75 % ) say individuals should have the right to choose between different types of health insurance including some that cost more and cover just about all medical procedures and some that cost less while covering only major medical procedures .

D.C. Health Link unveiled awards ranging from $ 80,000 to $ 400,000 to local organizations charged with serving as “ in-person assisters ” who will raise awareness about President Obama ’ s signature reforms and help consumers determine if they qualify for government subsidies on the city ’ s health exchange , Medicaid coverage or other benefits .
Among notable grantees , Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan Washington , D.C. , obtained $ 375,000 .
The assisters will be touting the Affordable Care Act at local events they would attend , anyway , and ramping up outreach in libraries , partnering businesses and houses of worship .
“ It does take a village , and it will take a village , for us to be successful , ” said Mila Kofman , executive director of the D.C. Health Benefit Exchange .
The announcement in downtown Washington offered a ground-level view at how jurisdictions that embraced Mr. Obama ’ s law from the start are preparing to get residents enrolled on their health exchanges , starting on Oct. 1 , for coverage that takes effect on Jan. 1 .
“ We are laser-focused on October , opening our doors and doing well for our consumers , ” Ms. Kofman said , noting the city has met crucial deadlines in setting up the exchange ’ s information-technology infrastructure .
The exchanges , or “ marketplaces ” as they are also known , are an integral part of the law offering premium tax credits to those who earn between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level .
The District and 16 states are building their own health exchange . More than half the states , 26 , opted to let the federal government set up one for them , and the remaining seven states are sharing the duty with the feds .
Authors of the law provided the financial assistance to help Americans comply with the “ individual mandate ” requiring almost everyone in the country to obtain some form of insurance .
The Obama administration hopes young and healthy residents will sign up for insurance on the exchanges to keep premiums in check when sicker Americans with pre-existing conditions enroll , since they can no longer be denied coverage .
But critics of the law say premiums will skyrocket in some states because of the law ’ s stipulations . They also say the in-person assistance programs are ripe for abuse and could let bad apples gain access to enrollees ’ personal information .
Ms. Kofman said grantees in the District must have their finances in order and that individual assisters must be fingerprinted and pass criminal background checks . She also noted her professional background is steeped in rooting out health care scams .
The D.C. grantees were chosen from among 87 applicants , who had requested an aggregate amount of $ 75 million .
Expert reviews and officials from the exchange selected groups — they range from health centers to churches to community nonprofits — based on their ability to cover a broad spectrum of the District , particularly in areas with a high proportion of uninsured residents . They also sought groups with assisters who could speak Spanish or Amharic , the latter a reflection of the city ’ s large Ethiopian population .
“ For many , this may be the first time they have had a fair shake at getting insurance , ” said Diane Lewis , chairwoman of the D.C. exchange .
The District has a relatively low proportion of uninsured residents , but officials said the resources will go a long way toward reaching those who still lack coverage .
“ Amen , somebody , ” said Rev . Henry White , senior pastor of Brown Memorial African Methodist Episcopal Church , which received a $ 95,000 grant .
Congressional staffers who live in the city will be among the enrollees in the D.C. exchange , because of a provision in the law aimed at making sure members of Congress and their aides feel the effects of the reforms firsthand .
The Obama administration sparked controversy when it recently decided to let the government offer a traditional subsidy that offsets 75 percent of members ’ and staffers ’ premium costs , even though they will be gaining coverage through the exchange .
The proposed rule by the Office of Personnel Management said individual lawmakers will designate who is an official staff member subject to the exchange .
Ms. Kofman said she is having preliminary discussions with Capitol Hill to make the transition “ as seamless as possible , ” but she does not yet have an official roster or tally of congressional employees who will enter the city ’ s exchange .","City officials in the nation’s capital on Wednesday awarded $6.4 million in grants to nearly three dozen community groups charged with helping residents navigate benefits within the new health care law.

The Obama administration hopes young and healthy residents will sign up for insurance on the exchanges to keep premiums in check when sicker Americans with pre-existing conditions enroll, since they can no longer be denied coverage.

But critics of the law say premiums will skyrocket in some states because of the law’s stipulations. They also say the in-person assistance programs are ripe for abuse and could let bad apples gain access to enrollees’ personal information.

Ms. Kofman said grantees in the District must have their finances in order and that individual assisters must be fingerprinted and pass criminal background checks. She also noted her professional background is steeped in rooting out health care scams.

The D.C. grantees were chosen from among 87 applicants, who had requested an aggregate amount of $75 million.

Expert reviews and officials from the exchange selected groups — they range from health centers to churches to community nonprofits — based on their ability to cover a broad spectrum of the District, particularly in areas with a high proportion of uninsured residents. They also sought groups with assisters who could speak Spanish or Amharic, the latter a reflection of the city’s large Ethiopian population.

“For many, this may be the first time they have had a fair shake at getting insurance,” said Diane Lewis, chairwoman of the D.C. exchange.

The District has a relatively low proportion of uninsured residents, but officials said the resources will go a long way toward reaching those who still lack coverage.

“Amen, somebody,” said Rev. Henry White, senior pastor of Brown Memorial African Methodist Episcopal Church, which received a $95,000 grant.

Congressional staffers who live in the city will be among the enrollees in the D.C. exchange, because of a provision in the law aimed at making sure members of Congress and their aides feel the effects of the reforms firsthand.

The Obama administration sparked controversy when it recently decided to let the government offer a traditional subsidy that offsets 75 percent of members’ and staffers’ premium costs, even though they will be gaining coverage through the exchange.

The proposed rule by the Office of Personnel Management said individual lawmakers will designate who is an official staff member subject to the exchange.

Ms. Kofman said she is having preliminary discussions with Capitol Hill to make the transition “as seamless as possible,” but she does not yet have an official roster or tally of congressional employees who will enter the city’s exchange.

The administration late Thursday asked a U.S. District Court in Texas to do something congressional Republicans weren’t willing to take on themselves during last year’s repeal effort: Strike the most popular part of Obamacare.

Few congressional Republicans rushed to defend the administration's move Friday, instead emphasizing their support for preserving pre-existing condition protections.

“I’m not going to have to defend anything I don’t agree with — regardless of who says it,” said Rep. Phil Roe of Tennessee when asked if he would defend the administration’s request on the campaign trail this fall. He added that rising premiums for Obamacare coverage will force lawmakers to address health care policy next year.

Sen. Susan Collins of Maine — one of three GOP senators who blocked the Obamacare repeal effort last year — also pushed back, warning the administration's new bid “exacerbates our current challenges” and could undermine key patient protections.

Other lawmakers pointed to past support for policies to prevent insurance companies from denying or dropping people with pre-existing conditions.

In 2017, “I introduced [an amendment that] would guarantee coverage for pre-existing conditions. I think that’s a pretty essential pact with the American people,” said Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.). “We need to let them go forward and see if it goes anywhere. Right now they’ve simply made an appeal to the court.”

And several Republicans dodged questions on the subject, saying they were unfamiliar with the legal request.

“I want to think about it before I respond,” said Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.).

Senate Democrats, who this week promised to force votes on health care during August, said the court filing proves their warnings that Republicans remain intent on repealing Obamacare through any means available.

“I’ve decided not to be surprised about anything this administration does,” said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). “It’s our job to make sure everybody knows who’s responsible for that, so that they can hold Republicans responsible at the polls this November.”

Within hours of the news, Democrats pounced on the Senate Republicans up for reelection this fall. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee blasted releases questioning whether those Republicans — such as North Dakota hopeful Rep. Kevin Cramer — back the Trump administration’s decision.

Murphy dismissed Republicans' efforts to distance themselves from the administration’s legal position, arguing that it was the GOP that fueled the case by repealing Obamacare’s individual mandate.

“Republicans and the Trump administration are working hand in hand,” he said.

During last year's repeal debate, Republicans decided to leave pre-existing conditions protections in place after they repeatedly became the subject of sometimes fiery town hall meetings with constituents.

The legal move Thursday threatens to revive those tensions and overshadow positive messages about Republican policies such as tax cuts.

“It just blows me away how dumb it is,” said GOP consultant Rick Wilson. “They really wanted to spend this summer saying the tax bill’s great, the economy’s great. But they go off the rails at every opportunity, and it just slays me.”

Texas and several Republican-led states brought the Obamacare challenge, arguing that the elimination of individual mandate penalties — which the Supreme Court ruled in 2012 were valid under Congress’s taxing power — invalidated the constitutionality of all of Obamacare.

AHIP signaled it will file an amicus brief in the case, officially siding with the blue states that have stepped in to defend the law’s constitutionality.

More On This...

The Fox News poll, which is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,007 randomly chosen registered voters, found 71 percent of voters believed ObamaCare will increase their taxes, while 62 percent believe it will increase the cost of their premiums. Sixty-five percent believe implementing the law will add to the federal deficit.

The confusion over what will happen with the Affordable Care Act seems to be growing as the Oct. 1 opening of ObamaCare exchanges draws near.

Major elements of the law have been met with strong opposition and the White House's plan to pump up support appears to be running into hardening perceptions.

Initially, the goal was to provide medical coverage for the country's 50 million uninsured and to restrain skyrocketing costs. Last month, Obama acknowledged glitches in implementing the law and announced a one-year delay in a major provision requiring companies to provide coverage for their workers.

In the latest development, the administration has also delayed for a year a cap on out-of-pocket medical costs. A partial cap will still go into effect, but the delay could lead to consumers paying more for out-of-pocket drug costs in the interim.

So far, 21 governors have opted out of the law's Medicaid expansion and even more refused to set up a health insurance marketplace -- those marketplaces are supposed to get off the ground at the beginning of 2014.

Labor unions have also ramped up their criticism of ObamaCare and its impact on union-run health plans. Many claim the law will drive up costs for plans that are managed jointly by small business owners and unions which could cause unionized employers to drop coverage to 20 million people.

Union officials also have been upset that the Obama administration listened to employer requests to delay a provision requiring bigger companies to provide insurance coverage or pay a penalty.

Laborers International Union of North America President Terry O'Sullivan sent Obama an email last month saying the law has ""destructive consequences."" O'Sullivan's letter echoed the sentiments written in a separate letter by the heads of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the United Food and Commercial Workers and Unite Here. The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers went a step further and took out print ads raising concerns over the law.

The setbacks seem to be taking a toll on how Americans view the overhaul.

According to an Aug. 12 Rasmussen Reports poll, 53 percent of U.S. voters said they viewed Obama's health care law unfavorably. The national survey of 1,000 voters found 42 percent of that group having a ""very unfavorable"" opinion of the law.

Those numbers are in line with a Gallup poll that found more Americans to have a negative rather than a positive view about the health care law's future impact on their family and the country.

Fifty-two percent of Americans say they disapprove of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, while 44 percent approve. Last fall, 48 percent said they approved of the law and 45 percent disapproved. Americans have generally been divided in their views of the law since it was passed in 2010.

Obama defended the law at a press conference this past Friday, and blasted Republicans for continuing to speak ill of it.

These types of problems turn up again and again in all five Republican plans . When you try to repeal Obamacare and maintain the law 's subsidies , it turns out you end up with some very bizarre policy outcomes that are not good for the individual insurance market .
Who supports it : Sen. Ron Johnson introduced this bill in April , and it has the most mainstream support among Senate Republicans . Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has signed on as a co-sponsor of the bill , signaling that this could become the dominant position of Senate Republicans in the event of a ruling against the health law .
What it does : Johnson 's proposal does two main things : it kills the individual mandate , and it sunsets Obamacare 's subsidies in August 2017 . In opinion columns , the Wisconsin senator has framed those two policy changes as setting the stage for Congress to pass a full Obamacare replacement bill in 2017 .
`` This transitional piece of legislation would live up to its name , reverse many of the negative unintended consequences of Obamacare , and pave the way for full replacement in 2017 , '' Johnson wrote in a May 27 USA Today op-ed .
Johnson wants to leave the subsidies in the individual market intact through August 2017 to create a smoother transition . But he has another policy proposal that would n't be smooth at all : immediately eliminating the individual mandate and no longer requiring Americans to carry health coverage .
How it changes the individual market : Without a requirement to purchase insurance coverage , health economists roundly expect premiums would spike as healthy , young people opt not to purchase a plan . This could , even in the transitional period , make the Obamacare markets a much more expensive place to shop .
Who supports it : Freshman Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse , who introduced the bill in March . He currently has no co-sponsors .
What it does : Sasse , like Johnson , envisions a transition period , although he has a much more complex structure around it . Sasse 's plan overhauls the health law 's subsidies to cover 65 percent of each enrollee 's premium .
This is really different from the current Obamacare subsidy structure , which covers a larger chunk of the premium for lower-income enrollees . Under the Sasse plan , a person who earns $ 15,000 and one who earns $ 30,000 would pay the same price for their coverage . The Weekly Standard outlined what , exactly , this would look like for a family of five in Milwaukee :
Take a family of five living in Milwaukee , Wisconsin with an income of $ 30,000 and parents aged 59 and 54 . If they ’ re enrolled in Obamacare ’ s second-cheapest `` silver '' plan , they currently receive a whopping $ 20,142 in taxpayer-funded Obamacare premium subsidies , plus further lavish subsidies to help cover their out-of-pocket costs . Under Sasse ’ s proposal , they would have to settle for a tax credit of $ 13,484 ( 65 percent of the $ 20,745 premium ) .
In their hypothetical example , the Milwaukee family would lose about $ 7,000 in subsidies . And this amount would decline over time : the Sasse plan would slowly wind down these subsidies , reducing them by 5 percent each month — until , after 18 months of reductions , the subsidies were eliminated .
The Sasse plan does n't do much else to change Obamacare . It does n't , like other proposals , kill the individual mandate or repeal big chunks of the law . Some conservatives have praised this strategy as a way to put pressure on Republicans to come up with an Obamacare replacement .
How it changes the individual market : Because of its regressive structure , the Sasse plan would make the individual market a more difficult place for low-income Americans to shop . And more generally , as the subsidies dwindle down month by month , all enrollees ' coverage becomes increasingly expensive .
Who supports it : Sens . Lamar Alexander ( R-LA ) , Orrin Hatch ( R-UT ) , and John Barrasso ( R-WY ) co-authored a Washington Post op-ed in March outlining this approach .
What it does : Like the two other Senate proposals , the Alexander-Hatch-Barrasso plan would authorize the Obamacare subsidies to continue temporarily . Unlike the two other proposals , it does not outline a specific timeline — whether this would be for a few months , a few years , or something else entirely .
The Bridge proposal is arguably the vaguest of the proposals that Republicans have put out . The main idea is that state exchanges would continue to operate like they do now . States on the federal marketplace would get `` the freedom and flexibility to create better , more competitive health insurance markets offering more options and different choices . '' What exactly that flexibility looks like , however , is not outlined .
How it would change the individual market : Because this plan is so vague , it 's difficult to know what , exactly , the individual market would look like in the Bridge scenario . But the idea of `` more options and different choices '' suggests a market where insurance plans would not have to cover a core set of insurance benefits , like pregnancy or no co-pay preventive care . This would make coverage both skimpier and less expensive .
Is there legislation ? No , but there is a Washington Post op-ed from March 3 outlining the main ideas .
Who supports it : A group of 21 of conservative Republican House representatives , including bill sponsor Tom Price ( R-GA ) .
What it does : First , the Patient Freedom Act kills some pretty big parts of Obamacare 's insurance expansion . The marketplace to shop for insurance , the individual mandate , the ban on preexisting conditions , the extension of benefits to young adults up to age 26 — those all go out the window .
The plan does , however , keep one key element : subsidies . This House plan would maintain subsidies for people who purchase their own health insurance , presumably in the type of individual market that existed before Obamacare .
How it would change the individual market : A world in which the Patient Freedom Act passes is one in which many fewer Americans have access to health insurance . It would once again allow insurance plans to reject people with preexisting conditions . Those who could get a plan would have access to subsidies to make insurance more affordable and , unlike the Sasse and Johnson plans , these subsidies would not go away at some point . They 're here to stay — at least until a point when Republicans could come up with a different health-care plan .
Who supports it : Reps. John Kline ( R-MN ) , Fred Upton ( R-MI ) , and Paul Ryan ( R-WI ) co-authored a Wall Street Journal op-ed outlining what their preferred reaction to King v. Burwell would look like . All three hold leadership positions in the House , meaning this is the type of plan that would likely advance through the legislative chamber in the case of a ruling against the administration .
What it does : The Kline-Upton-Ryan plan essentially gives each state a choice : stick with Obamacare or opt out of it pretty completely . Hence , they describe their solution as an `` off-ramp '' from the health-care law .
`` Off-ramp '' states would have the flexibility to ditch most major parts of Obamacare . The individual mandate would disappear , as would the requirements that health insurance plans cover a certain set of benefits . ( Obamacare makes all health plans cover things like pregnancy and preventive benefits , which some plans used to skip . ) At the same time , these states would still keep some of the most popular parts of Obamacare , like the ban on preexisting conditions and the extension of dependent benefits to young adults under 26 .
All states would continue to have insurance subsidies , regardless of whether they take the `` off-ramp '' option . In states that decline the new approach — likely states with Democratic governors — Obamacare continues to operate just like it does right now .
How it would change the individual insurance market : In those that do get on the off-ramp , the insurance market would look pretty different . The Kline-Upton-Ryan approach sets up a market where insurers are required to take all shoppers — but shoppers are n't required to purchase a plan . Only the really sick people would likely buy coverage , sending premiums skyrocketing . In this scenario , where most of the consumers are sick people with high medical bills , you could see insurers deciding to exit the market .
Is there legislation ? No , but there is a Wall Street Journal op-ed from March 3 outlining these ideas .","Republicans might have a new Obamacare problem: what to do if they win at the Supreme Court later this month.

When you repeal Obamacare and maintain its subsidies, the policy outcomes are bizarre

These types of problems turn up again and again in all five Republican plans. When you try to repeal Obamacare and maintain the law's subsidies, it turns out you end up with some very bizarre policy outcomes that are not good for the individual insurance market.

Senate proposals

Preserving Freedom and Choice in Health Care Act

Who supports it: Sen. Ron Johnson introduced this bill in April, and it has the most mainstream support among Senate Republicans. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has signed on as a co-sponsor of the bill, signaling that this could become the dominant position of Senate Republicans in the event of a ruling against the health law.

How it changes the individual market: Without a requirement to purchase insurance coverage, health economists roundly expect premiums would spike as healthy, young people opt not to purchase a plan. This could, even in the transitional period, make the Obamacare markets a much more expensive place to shop.

Is there legislation? Yes, Senate Bill 1016.

Winding Down Obamacare Act

Who supports it: Freshman Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse, who introduced the bill in March. He currently has no co-sponsors.

What it does: Sasse, like Johnson, envisions a transition period, although he has a much more complex structure around it. Sasse's plan overhauls the health law's subsidies to cover 65 percent of each enrollee's premium.

This is really different from the current Obamacare subsidy structure, which covers a larger chunk of the premium for lower-income enrollees.

If they’re enrolled in Obamacare’s second-cheapest ""silver"" plan, they currently receive a whopping $20,142 in taxpayer-funded Obamacare premium subsidies, plus further lavish subsidies to help cover their out-of-pocket costs. Under Sasse’s proposal, they would have to settle for a tax credit of $13,484 (65 percent of the $20,745 premium).

In their hypothetical example, the Milwaukee family would lose about $7,000 in subsidies. And this amount would decline over time: the Sasse plan would slowly wind down these subsidies, reducing them by 5 percent each month — until, after 18 months of reductions, the subsidies were eliminated.

How it changes the individual market: Because of its regressive structure, the Sasse plan would make the individual market a more difficult place for low-income Americans to shop. And more generally, as the subsidies dwindle down month by month, all enrollees' coverage becomes increasingly expensive.

Is there legislation? Yes, Senate Bill 673.

A Bridge Away From Obamacare

Who supports it: Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-LA), Orrin Hatch (R-UT), and John Barrasso (R-WY) co-authored a Washington Post op-ed in March outlining this approach.

What it does: Like the two other Senate proposals, the Alexander-Hatch-Barrasso plan would authorize the Obamacare subsidies to continue temporarily.

How it would change the individual market: Because this plan is so vague, it's difficult to know what, exactly, the individual market would look like in the Bridge scenario.

This would make coverage both skimpier and less expensive.

Is there legislation? No, but there is a Washington Post op-ed from March 3 outlining the main ideas.

House proposals

Patient Freedom Act of 2014

Who supports it: A group of 21 of conservative Republican House representatives, including bill sponsor Tom Price (R-GA).

What it does: First, the Patient Freedom Act kills some pretty big parts of Obamacare's insurance expansion. The marketplace to shop for insurance, the individual mandate, the ban on preexisting conditions, the extension of benefits to young adults up to age 26 — those all go out the window.

The plan does, however, keep one key element: subsidies. This House plan would maintain subsidies for people who purchase their own health insurance, presumably in the type of individual market that existed before Obamacare.

How it would change the individual market: A world in which the Patient Freedom Act passes is one in which many fewer Americans have access to health insurance. It would once again allow insurance plans to reject people with preexisting conditions. Those who could get a plan would have access to subsidies to make insurance more affordable and, unlike the Sasse and Johnson plans, these subsidies would not go away at some point. They're here to stay — at least until a point when Republicans could come up with a different health-care plan.

Is there legislation? Yes, H.R. 1234.

An Off-Ramp From Obamacare

Who supports it: Reps. John Kline (R-MN), Fred Upton (R-MI), and Paul Ryan (R-WI) co-authored a Wall Street Journal op-ed outlining what their preferred reaction to King v. Burwell would look like. All three hold leadership positions in the House, meaning this is the type of plan that would likely advance through the legislative chamber in the case of a ruling against the administration.

What it does: The Kline-Upton-Ryan plan essentially gives each state a choice: stick with Obamacare or opt out of it pretty completely. Hence, they describe their solution as an ""off-ramp"" from the health-care law.

""Off-ramp"" states would have the flexibility to ditch most major parts of Obamacare. The individual mandate would disappear, as would the requirements that health insurance plans cover a certain set of benefits. (Obamacare makes all health plans cover things like pregnancy and preventive benefits, which some plans used to skip.) At the same time, these states would still keep some of the most popular parts of Obamacare, like the ban on preexisting conditions and the extension of dependent benefits to young adults under 26.

All states would continue to have insurance subsidies, regardless of whether they take the ""off-ramp"" option. In states that decline the new approach — likely states with Democratic governors — Obamacare continues to operate just like it does right now.

How it would change the individual insurance market: In those that do get on the off-ramp, the insurance market would look pretty different. The Kline-Upton-Ryan approach sets up a market where insurers are required to take all shoppers — but shoppers aren't required to purchase a plan. Only the really sick people would likely buy coverage, sending premiums skyrocketing. In this scenario, where most of the consumers are sick people with high medical bills, you could see insurers deciding to exit the market.

Is there legislation? No, but there is a Wall Street Journal op-ed from March 3 outlining these ideas.",www.vox.com,left,fWFaavcIqrghrvtu

`` It 's a very real barrier , '' say Daniel Zingale , vice president of the California Endowment , a Los Angeles nonprofit that promotes the law among Latinos .
`` Families are worried about being deported and divided by having any official interaction with the government , '' he says .
The fear that 's keeping many of the 10.2 million Latinos eligible for the Affordable Care Act , often called Obamacare , from buying the mandated insurance is common among families of mixed legal status , health-care advocates say .
`` Our community is about family , so protecting the family comes first , '' says Jane Delgado , executive director of the National Alliance for Hispanic Health in Washington .
`` This is very personal information that they 're being asked to share , '' she adds .
About 9 million people live in families that include members who are in the US legally as well as some who are here illegally , according to the Pew Research Center . Under the new law , only people in the country legally qualify for help with health-care insurance .
Despite a public statement released by Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) that health-care information would remain confidential , many Latinos remain skeptical that an agency that has deported record numbers of people in the past few years will keep its promise .
The Obama administration deported 368,644 people last year . While that level marks a 10 percent drop from 2012 , the decrease was the first reported since the president took office in 2009 .
`` There 's a great deal of skepticism and a lack of trust , and it 's understandable given the large number of families who have been divided and deported , '' says Mr. Zingale of the California Endowment .
To succeed , the law must attract many more Latinos , who as a group are younger than the overall US population , to enroll in private health-care plans . The federal government offers subsidies to qualified enrollees .
Through December , 2.2 million people enrolled in health-care insurance through online exchanges , or marketplaces , launched in October , according to the US Department of Health and Human Services . The number includes no breakdown by ethnicity .
In California , which has the nation 's largest number of Latinos , Mr. Zingale says an all-out effort is underway to get Latinos to sign up for health-care insurance . This includes a Spanish-language billboard campaign and media initiatives similar to those publicizing the law in other states .
`` Latinos comprise roughly half of all Californians who are eligible for Obamacare , so if we fail among Latinos we will fail in implementing the new law , '' he adds .
Thirty-eight percent of California 's 38 million residents are Latino , and many of them prefer to speak Spanish .
`` There are a lot of challenges in enrolling large numbers of people in California , especially when there are cultural and language barriers , '' Zingale adds . `` We have a poor track record here of enrollment in public programs … so we 're trying to break our losing streak with Obamacare , and there are signs that we 're moving in the right direction . ''
In states that chose to let the federal government run the health-care exchange , such as Arizona , health-care advocates also are reaching out to Latinos who may be reluctant to sign up for health insurance , some for the first time .
Thirty-five percent of all Latino adults in the state are uninsured , compared with 10 percent of non-Hispanic whites , says Kim VanPelt , director of state health policy and advocacy with Cover Arizona , a coalition of organizations providing health-care resources and assurances .
`` Clearly , it 's incredibly important to be effective in terms of reaching out to the Latino population , '' she says .
In Minnesota , health-care advocates have enlisted help from established community leaders and businesses in Latino areas to get the word out about the law , as well as to emphasize that enrolling wo n't get family members expelled from the country .
`` There 's still a lot of concern in mixed families , '' says Carla Kohler , community health worker services manager at CLUES , a health-care provider in the Twin Cities .
`` There are a large number of children who are uninsured within the state of Minnesota , and it could partly be because of that fear , '' she adds .
To ease people 's angst , health-care advocates are now telling families that ICE has drawn a line between enrollment and immigration enforcement .

But health-care activists say that , in addition , public assurances from Obama would go a long way toward quelling anxiety about deportation .
`` I do n't think it 's asking too much for the president himself to offer legal Americans eligible for Obamacare the reassurance that they can enroll in this program without having their loved ones deported , '' says Zingale .","Website glitches aside, President Obama's new health-care law also is causing consternation among many Latinos over the possibility that signing up for the Affordable Care Act could get family members deported.

About 9 million people live in families that include members who are in the US legally as well as some who are here illegally, according to the Pew Research Center. Under the new law, only people in the country legally qualify for help with health-care insurance.

Despite a public statement released by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that health-care information would remain confidential, many Latinos remain skeptical that an agency that has deported record numbers of people in the past few years will keep its promise.

The Obama administration deported 368,644 people last year. While that level marks a 10 percent drop from 2012, the decrease was the first reported since the president took office in 2009.

""There's a great deal of skepticism and a lack of trust, and it's understandable given the large number of families who have been divided and deported,"" says Mr. Zingale of the California Endowment.

To succeed, the law must attract many more Latinos, who as a group are younger than the overall US population, to enroll in private health-care plans. The federal government offers subsidies to qualified enrollees.

Through December, 2.2 million people enrolled in health-care insurance through online exchanges, or marketplaces, launched in October, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services. The number includes no breakdown by ethnicity.

In California, which has the nation's largest number of Latinos, Mr. Zingale says an all-out effort is underway to get Latinos to sign up for health-care insurance. This includes a Spanish-language billboard campaign and media initiatives similar to those publicizing the law in other states.

""Latinos comprise roughly half of all Californians who are eligible for Obamacare, so if we fail among Latinos we will fail in implementing the new law,"" he adds.

Thirty-eight percent of California's 38 million residents are Latino, and many of them prefer to speak Spanish.

""There are a lot of challenges in enrolling large numbers of people in California, especially when there are cultural and language barriers,"" Zingale adds.""We have a poor track record here of enrollment in public programs … so we're trying to break our losing streak with Obamacare, and there are signs that we're moving in the right direction.""

In states that chose to let the federal government run the health-care exchange, such as Arizona, health-care advocates also are reaching out to Latinos who may be reluctant to sign up for health insurance, some for the first time.

Thirty-five percent of all Latino adults in the state are uninsured, compared with 10 percent of non-Hispanic whites, says Kim VanPelt, director of state health policy and advocacy with Cover Arizona, a coalition of organizations providing health-care resources and assurances.

""Clearly, it's incredibly important to be effective in terms of reaching out to the Latino population,"" she says.

In Minnesota, health-care advocates have enlisted help from established community leaders and businesses in Latino areas to get the word out about the law, as well as to emphasize that enrolling won't get family members expelled from the country.

""There's still a lot of concern in mixed families,"" says Carla Kohler, community health worker services manager at CLUES, a health-care provider in the Twin Cities.

""There are a large number of children who are uninsured within the state of Minnesota, and it could partly be because of that fear,"" she adds.

To ease people's angst, health-care advocates are now telling families that ICE has drawn a line between enrollment and immigration enforcement.

But health-care activists say that, in addition, public assurances from Obama would go a long way toward quelling anxiety about deportation.

""I don't think it's asking too much for the president himself to offer legal Americans eligible for Obamacare the reassurance that they can enroll in this program without having their loved ones deported,"" says Zingale.",www.csmonitor.com,center,fXsWICDPXItxATEu

Only about 25,000 Americans were able to enroll on the federal government ’ s HealthCare.gov website in October , when most people instead encountered computer errors . And although Mr. Obama and his top advisers vowed to fix the problems by the end of November , they have retreated from that pledge in favor of a scaled-back promise by Health and Human Service Secretary Kathleen Sebelius that the website will be working for “ most users ” by Saturday ’ s deadline .
This week , administration officials acknowledged they are holding back on a marketing campaign for the program because they don ’ t want too many users to visit the flawed site . And HHS also revealed this week that the Spanish-language version of HealthCare.gov still isn ’ t ready to enroll people ; HHS is postponing that service again until sometime in December .
The administration also Wednesday announced another major delay , putting off by one year the online program that lets small businesses shop for plans through the federal Obamacare marketplace .
The developments are the latest in a series of downsized goals , broken promises and delays for Obamacare since the program became law of the land in 2010 . If there has been a hallmark of Obamacare so far , it has been watching Mr. Obama ’ s optimistic assurances crumble later under the weight of reality .
“ The administration completely oversold what it was going to be , in terms of all dessert and no spinach , ” said Paul Howard , a specialist on health-care policy at the nonprofit Manhattan Institute .
Throughout the president ’ s re-election campaign in 2012 , Mr. Obama trumpeted the signature achievement of his first term and told voters that he was trustworthy above all else .
“ You do want to be able to trust your president , ” Mr. Obama told supporters in Ohio a few days before Election Day . “ You want to know that your president means what he says , and says what he means . And after four years as president , you know me . You know where I stand . You know I tell the truth . ”
Those words stand in stark contrast to Mr. Obama ’ s now-infamous broken pledge , repeatedly made without qualification , that “ if you like your health-insurance plan , you can keep your plan. ” By last month , with more than 3.5 million people being forced out of their old insurance policies by Obamacare , the president admitted that his promise wasn ’ t true for many people .
Behind the scenes , he reportedly berated his staff for allowing him to boast in public that buying health insurance would be as easy as shopping on Amazon.com .
In an interview with Barbara Walters to be broadcast Friday night on ABC ’ s “ 20/20 ” show , Mr. Obama said his team is looking into why he was kept in the dark about the website ’ s problems .
“ We ’ re evaluating why it is exactly that I didn ’ t know soon enough that [ it ] wasn ’ t going to work the way it needed to , ” Mr. Obama said . “ But my priority now has been to just make sure that it works . ”
But even the president ’ s apology was a bit of misdirection . Mr. Obama knew as early as February 2010 , one month before he signed the law , that millions of Americans wouldn ’ t be able to keep their health insurance .
At a health care summit with congressional Republicans at Blair House on Feb. 25 , 2010 , House Majority Leader Eric Cantor , Virginia Republican , who was House minority whip at the time , voiced concern to the president that “ between eight million and nine million people may very well lose the coverage that they have because of the construct of this bill . ”
“ I don ’ t think you can answer the question in the positive to say that people will be able to maintain their coverage , people will be able to see the doctors they want , in the kind of bill that you are proposing , ” Mr. Cantor told Mr. Obama .
The president replied that a relatively small portion of the population would be affected , and they would be better off under Obamacare .
Mr. Obama told Mr. Cantor , “ The eight to nine million people you refer to that might have to change their coverage — keep in mind out of the 300 million Americans that we are talking about — would be folks who the Congressional Budget Office estimates would find the deal in the exchange better . So , yes , they would change coverage because they got more choice and competition . ”
Those promises , Mr. Howard said , “ were papered over ” later with regulations requiring more expensive coverage for many .
“ The administration had to require tight grandfathering of current plans to move people into the exchanges , which means cancellations , ” Mr. Howard said .
Within six months of his second inauguration , Mr. Obama had broken his own law , delaying the crucial employer mandate portion of Obamacare by a full year until 2015 . The administration cited confusion by businesses about how to report employee insurance information to the Internal Revenue Service .
The president told supporters in Southern California this week that he ’ ll never back down from making sure the law works .
“ We are going to continue to implement the health care law , ” Mr. Obama said . “ The product is good . People want it . And we should not live in a country where people are going bankrupt just because they get sick . And anybody who is going to keep on pushing against that , they will meet my resistance , because I am willing to fix any problems that there are , but I ’ m not going to abandon people to make sure that they ’ ve got health insurance in this country . ”
With the faulty website preventing many people from enrolling , health care analysts say the next problem for Obamacare could be the failure to bring young , healthy people into the program . Obamacare needs people who don ’ t require much medical care to still be paying premiums , to offset the costs of older , sicker people who place greater demands on the system .
“ They have assumed wrongly that the plans they ’ re trying to sell through the exchanges are going to be attractive to relatively healthy Americans , ” said James Capretta , a public policy specialist at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute . “ I just think that ’ s wrong . Lots of people are going to end up not buying those plans . Mainly it ’ s going to be an attractive place for people who have existing health problems . It ’ s going to become essentially a program for relatively less healthy people . ”
Mr. Howard predicted the trend will create more problems for the program , financial and political , in 2014 as congressional mid-term elections near .
“ If the picture doesn ’ t improve in terms of getting these young and healthy people to enroll and it stays skewed , you ’ re looking at a cycle where we ’ re going to have more expensive rate increases for 2015 , ” Mr. Howard said . “ The government can push back [ against insurers ] and say the rates need to be lower , but the insurers can say ‘ We ’ ll walk. ’ That ’ s the real tension here . ”
As this happens , the premiums for everybody in the system then have to increase , which makes buying insurance an even less rational act for a healthy person , which means even fewer will sign up , and on and on — a phenomenon analysts of insurance markets refer to as the “ death spiral . ”
“ The expectation was that there would be a big pool of really healthy people offsetting a relatively smaller pool of more expensive patients . If that doesn ’ t play out , then the exchanges are looking at a problem in terms of affordability , a very serious problem , ” Mr. Howard said .
While the Obama administration is saying the website is getting better , the problems might also be preventing younger , healthier consumers from finding out how truly expensive their coverage would be .
“ Right now , people haven ’ t been able to really shop effectively , ” Mr. Howard said . “ A lot of these plans are going to be very narrow networks and come with high deductibles . Except for a few states you can purchase a plan and not really understand what kind of physician and hospital coverage you ’ re going to get . And then I would expect lots of stories to start popping up after January when people start to use the coverage and hearing complaints that they can ’ t see the doctor they want . ”
Administration officials say the website should be able to handle 50,000 users simultaneously by Friday , citing steady improvement in the speed of the site . By last week , the average load time for the website ’ s pages was less than one second , down from October ’ s time of eight seconds , according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services .
Jeffrey Zients , who was tapped by Mr. Obama to troubleshoot the problems with the website , has warned that Saturday ’ s deadline will not be “ a magic moment ” for the site . Instead , he said it will continue to make steady improvement .","The Obama administration promised to have the Obamacare website working smoothly by Saturday, but even President Obama knows this latest deadline is another target that his team is likely to miss.

SPECIAL COVERAGE: Health Care Reform

Throughout the president’s re-election campaign in 2012, Mr. Obama trumpeted the signature achievement of his first term and told voters that he was trustworthy above all else.

“You do want to be able to trust your president,” Mr. Obama told supporters in Ohio a few days before Election Day. “You want to know that your president means what he says, and says what he means. And after four years as president, you know me. You know where I stand. You know I tell the truth.”

Within six months of his second inauguration, Mr. Obama had broken his own law, delaying the crucial employer mandate portion of Obamacare by a full year until 2015. The administration cited confusion by businesses about how to report employee insurance information to the Internal Revenue Service.

The president told supporters in Southern California this week that he’ll never back down from making sure the law works.

“We are going to continue to implement the health care law,” Mr. Obama said. “The product is good. People want it. And we should not live in a country where people are going bankrupt just because they get sick. And anybody who is going to keep on pushing against that, they will meet my resistance, because I am willing to fix any problems that there are, but I’m not going to abandon people to make sure that they’ve got health insurance in this country.”

With the faulty website preventing many people from enrolling, health care analysts say the next problem for Obamacare could be the failure to bring young, healthy people into the program. Obamacare needs people who don’t require much medical care to still be paying premiums, to offset the costs of older, sicker people who place greater demands on the system.

“They have assumed wrongly that the plans they’re trying to sell through the exchanges are going to be attractive to relatively healthy Americans,” said James Capretta, a public policy specialist at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute. “I just think that’s wrong. Lots of people are going to end up not buying those plans. Mainly it’s going to be an attractive place for people who have existing health problems. It’s going to become essentially a program for relatively less healthy people.”

Mr. Howard predicted the trend will create more problems for the program, financial and political, in 2014 as congressional mid-term elections near.

“If the picture doesn’t improve in terms of getting these young and healthy people to enroll and it stays skewed, you’re looking at a cycle where we’re going to have more expensive rate increases for 2015,” Mr. Howard said. “The government can push back [against insurers] and say the rates need to be lower, but the insurers can say ‘We’ll walk.’ That’s the real tension here.”

As this happens, the premiums for everybody in the system then have to increase, which makes buying insurance an even less rational act for a healthy person, which means even fewer will sign up, and on and on — a phenomenon analysts of insurance markets refer to as the “death spiral.”

“The expectation was that there would be a big pool of really healthy people offsetting a relatively smaller pool of more expensive patients. If that doesn’t play out, then the exchanges are looking at a problem in terms of affordability, a very serious problem,” Mr. Howard said.

While the Obama administration is saying the website is getting better, the problems might also be preventing younger, healthier consumers from finding out how truly expensive their coverage would be.

“Right now, people haven’t been able to really shop effectively,” Mr. Howard said. “A lot of these plans are going to be very narrow networks and come with high deductibles. Except for a few states you can purchase a plan and not really understand what kind of physician and hospital coverage you’re going to get. And then I would expect lots of stories to start popping up after January when people start to use the coverage and hearing complaints that they can’t see the doctor they want.”

Administration officials say the website should be able to handle 50,000 users simultaneously by Friday, citing steady improvement in the speed of the site. By last week, the average load time for the website’s pages was less than one second, down from October’s time of eight seconds, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

Jeffrey Zients, who was tapped by Mr. Obama to troubleshoot the problems with the website, has warned that Saturday’s deadline will not be “a magic moment” for the site. Instead, he said it will continue to make steady improvement.

So, was the Congressional Budget Office really “way, way off … in every aspect” of how it predicted that Obamacare would work, as the White House claims? No, it wasn’t.

The CBO actually nailed the overall impact of the law on the uninsured pretty closely. It predicted a big drop in the percentage of people under age 65 who would lack insurance, and that turned out to be the case. CBO projected that in 2016 that nonelderly rate would fall to 11%, and the latest figure put the actual rate at 10.3%.

It’s true (as Trump administration officials have repeatedly pointed out) that CBO greatly overestimated the number who would get government-subsidized coverage through the new insurance exchanges. But at the same time, CBO underestimated the number who would get coverage through expanding Medicaid.

And whatever the failings of CBO’s predictions, they were closer to the mark than those of the Obama administration and some other prominent forecasters.

Let’s look at the details.

Back on March 20, 2010, when the law had taken its final form and was working its way to President Obama’s desk, the CBO issued its official estimate of the cost and effects of the Affordable Care Act. And after the Supreme Court struck down a key part of that law — ruling that states could not be forced to expand eligibility for Medicaid — CBO updated its estimates accordingly in July 2012.

In what follows, we will cite CBO’s 2012 projections unless otherwise indicated, since we can never know how accurate the 2010 projections would have been had the law been allowed to take effect as written.

Coverage

As it normally does, CBO attempted to forecast the law’s effects in each of the following 10 years. And here we compare what actually happened last year with what CBO predicted for 2016.

CBO got the big picture right. It predicted that millions of people would gain coverage, and millions did.

It predicted that the number of nonelderly (under age 65) people lacking insurance would drop to 30 million in 2016. And that turned out to be pretty close. The actual number was 27.9 million during the first nine months of last year, according to the latest figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Health Interview Survey. That’s a decline of 20.3 million since 2010, by CDC’s reckoning.

In percentage terms, CBO predicted 89% of the nonelderly would be covered by last year. CDC put the actual percentage at 89.7%.

Exchanges

Where CBO had trouble was predicting the number of newly insured who would get their coverage by purchasing private insurance through the new exchanges set up by the law. CBO predicted that in 2016 there would be 23 million getting policies through the exchanges. The actual number was 10.4 million during the first half of the year, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

That’s less than half the predicted total.

Medicaid

On the other hand, CBO was too low in its estimate of the number who would gain coverage through expansion of Medicaid, the state-federal program for low-income people and children.

CBO estimated 10 million would be added to the Medicaid rolls by 2016, even with many states refusing to expand eligibility. But that was too low. As of the first quarter of last year, 14.4 million adults had enrolled in Medicaid as a result of the Affordable Care Act’s expansion of the program, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured.

So to a large extent, CBO’s mistake was in estimating where the uninsured would get covered, not how many of them would gain coverage.

Other Estimates

In January 2016, the nonpartisan Commonwealth Fund published an analysis by New York University’s Sherry Glied of CBO’s forecast of the ACA’s effects. She called CBO’s predictions “reasonably accurate” compared with actual results in 2014.

The gap between CBO’s prediction and reality has widened now that 2016 figures are available for comparison. But Glied also found that CBO’s predictions were closer to 2014 reality than those of four other forecasters — the Obama administration’s own figures, and those of the RAND Corp., the Urban Institute and the Lewin Group, a health industry consulting firm.

Glied concluded, “Given the likelihood of additional reforms to national health policy in future years, it is reassuring that, despite the many unforeseen factors surrounding the law’s rollout and participation in its reforms, the CBO’s forecast was reasonably accurate.”

And on March 13, CBO issued another, much-anticipated projection of the Obamacare repeal bill being considered by the Republican-controlled House. CBO estimated that under the GOP’s American Health Care Act, 14 million fewer people would have health insurance next year than under current law, and that number would rise to 24 million in 2026.

“In 2026, an estimated 52 million people would be uninsured, compared with 28 million who would lack insurance that year under current law,” CBO said.

Earlier on the day the analysis was published, White House press secretary Sean Spicer — who had been denigrating CBO’s work for days — said, “The last time they did this, they were wildly off and the number keeps declining.”

But as we’ve seen, CBO did better than the White House would have you believe.

With his healthcare reform under attack and Americans increasingly skeptical of its benefits , President Barack Obama went on the offensive Thursday , announcing the program will put $ 500 million into consumers ' pockets this summer and claiming it has lowered insurance rates by $ 3.4 billion.At a White House announcement , Obama said 8.5 million policy holders will get rebate checks from insurance companies that spent less than 80 percent of premiums on actual medical care , one of the rules under Obamacare that is intended to limit administrative costs and profits.Obama , flanked by a dozen people who have received rebates or have seen their insurance rates go down , estimated the average check would be about $ 100 , evidence he claimed showed the program is working.The president 's speech , his third address solely to tout Obamacare this year , signals a renewed effort to promote the controvwho on Wednesday held two votes to repeal key provisions of the law .
Republicans were quick to respond on Thursday . House Speaker John Boehner insisted the GOP would continue fighting Obamacare .
`` The law has to go , '' Boehner said after the president 's speech , vowing to continue to work to `` fully repeal the president 's healthcare law in its entirety once and for all . ''
`` Fairness is a basic tenet of our society , '' Boehner said at a press briefing Thursday . `` And it is the bare minimum the American people should expect from their government . But too often under this president , they are n't seeing it . ''
Boehner said he has asked Reps. Tim Griffin , an Arkansas Republican , and Todd Young , a Republican from Indiana , co-sponsors of the two latest bills to repeal mandates , to keep up the pressure on Obamacare when they deliver the weekly Republican address .
And Ken Cuccinelli , Virginia 's Republican attorney general , released a video statement after Obama 's speech dismissing the president 's claims as `` damage control . ''
Cuccinelli , one of the attorneys general who filed lawsuits to block Obamacare , said the healthcare law continues to foist new costs on employers and said it will hike rates for some Virginians .
`` Recently Gallup released a poll of small business owners showing over 40 percent of them were holding off on hiring or expansion simply because of the cost and uncertainty imposed by Obamacare , '' said Cuccinelli , a candidate for governor of Virginia . `` That 's a job-killing impact of a job-killing law . ''
Obama accused the Republicans of playing politics by continuing to attack Obamacare . `` I mention all this because [ Wednesday ] , despite all the evidence that the law is working the way it is supposed to for middle-class Americans , Republicans in the House of Representatives voted for nearly the 40th time to dismantle it , '' Obama said . `` We 've got a lot of important work to do , '' Obama said . `` Yet instead , we are refighting these old battles . Sometimes I just try to figure out why . Maybe they think it 's good politics . But part of our job here is to not always think about politics . `` House GOP leaders seized on the Obama administration 's surprise move last week to delay the start of an employer mandate to provide health insurance or pay hefty fines . The White House rolled back the start from 2014 to 2015 to give businesses more time to comply with the law.Republicans claim the White House is giving businesses a break , while continuing to force individuals to comply with onerous rules that will force almost every American to have health insurance or pay fines beginning next year . `` To say , 'Well , we 're going to ... relax this mandate for a year on American business , but we 're going to continue to stick it to individuals and families , ' is strictly and simply unfair to the American people , '' Boehner said Wednesday.Voting mostly along party lines , the House on Wednesday approved delaying the employer mandate by a vote of 264-161 . But the House also voted 251-174 to extend a similar grace period to virtually all Americans who will be required to obtain coverage beginning Jan. 1 , the linchpin of the law.Both measures are likely dead on arrival in the Democratic-controlled Senate , and the White House has vowed that they would face a presidential veto if the bills made it as far as Obama 's desk.But Republicans hope the vote will pay dividends in the 2014 midterm elections by forcing Democrats to vote against delaying the start of the individual mandate.Obama did n't address the latest controversy over the employer-mandate delay , other than to concede `` that more work needs to be done '' in the rollout of the Affordable Care Act . He instead tried to focus on what could be called the positive effects of Obamacare amid growing public sentiment that the healthcare reform will make insurance more expensive and will force employers to slash jobs and hours . `` Most folks wo n't know that when a check comes in this was because of Obamacare , '' he said of the rebates that went out for the first time last summer . `` Generally speaking , what we 've seen is that healthcare costs have slowed drastically in a lot of areas since we passed the affordable care act , '' he said . `` We have a lot more work to do , but healthcare costs are not skyrocketing the way they were . `` The White House yesterday also released a report that claims the average cost of health insurance premiums will drop about 18 percent in 11 states next year when Obamacare takes effect , which is lower than the Congressional Budget Office had predicted.Among the 11 states is New York , where Gov .

New York was among the first states to develop a health exchange under the law , where individuals can buy insurance.Costs for a middle-of-the-road insurance policy average roughly $ 321 per month across the 11 states that have released their rate filings for next year , administration officials said — compared with initial estimates of $ 392 per month.But the push to put a positive spin on Obamacare remains an uphill fight.A Wall Street Journal/NBC poll last week found that 49 percent of Americans surveyed believe the Affordable Care Act is a `` bad idea , '' which was the most negative response since the poll began tracking sentiment on Obamacare three years ago.And 38 percent also said that the law would make the country `` worse off .

(CNN) – A newly disclosed report indicates that officials in the Obama administration and the Department of Health and Human Services received warnings from a private consultant group that the federal online healthcare enrollment site could potentially fail to function properly for the October 1 launch date.

The analysis by McKinsey & Company was requested by the White House. It identified various problems with the exchange, including limited testing time and resources before the launch, and found that call-in centers wouldn't function properly if the website malfunctioned.



The Obama administration has come under fire for the botched October 1 launch of healthcare.gov. The site has been plagued with technical issues barring many enrollees from signing up for the federal exchange though the site. This report suggests problems were brought to the attention of key officials as early as March.

The administration has said the President didn't know of problems with the Affordable Care Act's website until after its fumbled rollout - even though insurance companies had been complaining and the site crashed during a pre-launch test run.

A federal judge in the US state of Texas has ruled that a key part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), better known as Obamacare, is unconstitutional.

Twenty states argued the whole law was invalidated by a change in tax rules last year which eliminated a penalty for not having health insurance.

President Donald Trump said the ruling was great news for America.

The law's provisions will, however, remain in place until an appeal is heard at the US Supreme Court.

President Trump promised to dismantle Barack Obama's landmark 2010 healthcare law, which was designed to make medical cover affordable for the many Americans who had been priced out of the market.

But despite his Republican Party having majorities in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, the ACA is still operating.

However, in 2017 Congress did repeal the requirement - the so-called individual mandate - that people buy health insurance or pay a tax penalty.

Mr Trump took to Twitter following the judge's ruling in Texas.

He also urged incoming Democratic Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi to ""pass a STRONG law that provides GREAT healthcare"".

The ruling came a day before the deadline for Obamacare enrolment for the coming year.

What does the ruling say?

Two Republicans - Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and his Wisconsin counterpart Brad Schimel led the legal challenge.

Sitting in Fort Worth, US District Judge Reed O'Connor noted that a $1.5tn tax bill passed by Congress in 2017 eliminated the tax penalties which anyone who failed to obtain health insurance had to pay.

He ruled that the individual mandate was now unconstitutional.

As the individual mandate was an ""essential"" element of the ACA, the whole of Obamacare was therefore unconstitutional, Judge O'Connor said.

He said his ruling was concerned with the intentions of the 2010 and 2017 Congresses.

""The former enacted the ACA. The latter sawed off the last leg it stood on.""

What reaction has there been?

Ms Pelosi described the ruling as ""cruel"" and ""absurd"" and said it would be repealed.

She said it exposed ""the monstrous endgame of Republicans' all-out assault on people with pre-existing conditions and Americans' access to affordable health care"".

Mr Schumer, meanwhile, said the ruling appeared ""to be based on faulty legal reasoning and hopefully it will be overturned"".

He said that if it was upheld in the higher courts ""it will be a disaster for tens of millions of American families, especially for people with pre-existing conditions"".

What comes next?

The decision is almost certain to be challenged in the US Supreme Court.

White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said that the law would remain in place for the time being, pending further legal developments.

Minnesota is signing up thousands on its exchange and at rates far lower than Wisconsin
Reason for large gap in rates is unclear but could be because Minnesota has been more aggressive
WASHINGTON -- When Joe Atkins hunkered down to draft legislation outlining how Minnesota would implement the Affordable Care Act , he had no idea the results would be so dramatic .
The Gopher State is now enrolling individuals through its health-insurance exchange by the thousands and at premium rates that are among the lowest in the country .
Next door in Wisconsin , the numbers of Obamacare enrollees have barely hit the hundreds and rates are between 25 and 35 percent higher than in Minnesota .
`` I wish that was n't the case , but I 'm sure glad , '' says Atkins , a Democratic Farm Labor Party state lawmaker . `` Folks are thinking I 'm pretty smart right now . ''
Minnesotans and Wisconsinites share a long-standing rivalry -- in politics , business , and , of course , on the football field . But the new health law has opened another front in the competition . And so far , Minnesota is ahead .
The reason for the large gap in rates is unclear but could be , in part , because of the more aggressive approach Minnesota has taken to implementing the law .
The most obvious difference between the two states is their exchanges . Minnesota has its own online marketplace where residents and small businesses can shop for and buy insurance , while Wisconsin is relying on the federal government marketplace , which has been plagued with bugs and technical failures and does n't accommodate small businesses .
If and when the Obama administration fixes that , the rate differentials will remain . And they are stark .
A 50-year-old Minnesotan who lives just south of the Twin Cities in Dakota County can buy a mid-level , silver plan for $ 241 a month . Just 20 miles away , across the state line in St. Croix County , the lowest cost silver plan available to a 50-year-old Wisconsinite costs nearly three times that price -- $ 622 a month .
The statewide average for such a plan in Minnesota is $ 304 , compared to $ 403 in Wisconsin , a Gannett analysis of federal and state data found . Those rates do not take into account the subsidies some lower-income consumers will receive .
The disparity carries through to younger consumers as well . Twenty-seven-year-olds living in Brown , Outagamie or Marathon counties , for example , have to pay roughly the statewide Wisconsin average of around $ 235 a month for the lowest cost mid-level plan . Over in Minnesota , individuals in their mid-20s can get those plans 36 percent cheaper for $ 150 on average .
Wisconsin 's rates are not just higher than Minnesota 's , they 're 21 percent higher than the average across 34 states for which the federal government released detailed premium data .
Wisconsin officials acknowledged the rate disparities but said they are confident insurance companies in the state are not overcharging consumers . Deputy Insurance Commissioner Dan Schwartzer pointed to a requirement under the health law that carriers spend 80 percent of premium revenue on medical claims . That limits overhead costs , including administration , salaries and profits , to 20 percent .
`` When they submit rates , they know that they 've got to stay under the 20 percent cap or they 're going to have to refund it back , anyways , '' Schwartzer said in an interview .
He also said premiums have historically been higher in Wisconsin , pointing to a 2012 Health and Human Services Department study that showed private employers in the Badger State paid premiums that were 7 percent higher on average than in Minnesota .
Analysts say premiums are based on a number of factors , from health costs and demographics to market competitiveness . But when it comes to Wisconsin and Minnesota , none of those appears to account for such a wide disparity .
The nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation found that health care costs in the two states are roughly the same . Per capita expenditures were $ 7,409 in Minnesota versus $ 7,233 in Wisconsin , according to the most recent data released in 2011 by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services . And the costs have grown annually since 1991 at nearly the same rate -- 6.7 percent in Wisconsin and 7 percent in Minnesota .
As for competitiveness , there are only five insurers offering plans on the Minnesota exchange , while there are 13 carriers participating in the Wisconsin exchange .
Cynthia Cox , a policy analyst at the Kaiser Family Foundation , said regulation also plays a role in premium levels .
In Minnesota , regulators forced insurers in several cases to resubmit lower rates because they questioned the justifications for them . In Wisconsin , regulators took a more hands-off approach and let all the rates go through as-is after reviewing carriers ' justifications .
Liberal advocacy group Citizen Action Wisconsin pointed to another possible factor in a report it released a few weeks ago : Gov . Scott Walker 's decision not to expand Medicaid as much as other states and to transition some 77,000 people off Badgercare and force them to buy insurance on the federal exchange .
The group pointed to an analysis by the nonpartisan Rand Corporation that predicted failing to expand Medicaid would increase rates by 8 to 10 percent for insurance sold on individual exchanges . That 's because lower-income individuals tend to be less healthy -- with higher health care costs -- and forcing them onto the exchanges would make the pool of prospective insured less healthy , driving up premiums .
`` The fundamental difference between the two states , which are similar geographically and demographically and have very similar underlying medical costs , is that Minnesota has embraced the national health care reform law and is using the tools it provides to deliver more affordable health insurance , while the Walker administration has tried to undermine the law at every turn , '' Citizen Action CEO Robert Kraig and researcher Kevin Kane wrote in a scathing op-ed recently .
But Schwartzer , the Wisconsin deputy insurance commissioner , dismissed that argument , said there is no evidence that the 77,000 individuals leaving Badgercare are unhealthy .
And he said the state 's rate-review process was sound . Schwartzer said that actuaries reviewed the rates insurers submitted and did n't find any that appeared out of whack . And he said the Walker administration did n't see any point in brow-beating insurers into offering lower rates when market forces are in play .
`` We let them beat each other up versus us beating the insurer up , '' he said . `` Let them beat each other up being competitive against each other . ''
Schwartzer pointed to another potential factor in insurers setting higher rates in the state -- the dissolution of the state 's high-risk pool , where some 22,000 Wisconsinites with pre-existing conditions and therefore higher health care costs had been getting insurance .
`` From an insurer 's perspective , the other major factor , other than uninsured population would be those in the high risk pools going into the private market , '' Schwartzer said .
Over in Minnesota , state officials are keeping their high-risk pool open for another year .
Minnesota officials happily point to several other decisions they say resulted in low rates . After the health law passed in March 2010 , the state acted quickly to form a task force on implementation and decided to expand Medicaid and set up its own exchange .
`` The first motivation is I did n't want the federal government imposing one on us , '' Atkins , the author of Minnesota 's implementation law , said in an interview . `` Quite frankly , I expected we would have lower rates if we did it ourselves . And finally , when one has a problem , I prefer to dial a 651 area code rather than a 202 area code . ''
Minnesota Commerce Department Spokeswoman Anne O'Connor also points to the rigorous review process that insurers had to go through before Commerce Commissioner Mike Rothman approved plans offered on their exchange .
`` In this case , the rates Commissioner Rothman approved for the 141 plans available through MNsure were 4 to 37 percent lower than had originally been filed , '' O'Connor said .
The White House is hoping that Wisconsin and other states will change their minds and join Minnesota in expanding Medicaid . When the program funding health care for the poor and disabled was first passed in 1965 , only 26 states initially agreed to participate , but within five years , 48 states had opted in .
`` It is our belief that expansion is going to grow because as governors and hospitals and others in respective states look at it , it just makes sense to do it , and it is the right thing to do , '' top Obama aide David Simas said .
`` The decision 's been made , '' Schwartzer said , `` and what we 're trying to do is move forward , directed by the governor , with making this work as best as you can make it work for consumers in Wisconsin . ''
Whatever the case , some Wisconsinites say the state 's entire health care system needs to mount a better challenge to Minnesota .
`` I do n't want to lose this race , '' said Bob DeVita , CEO of Common Ground Healthcare Cooperative in Brookfield , Wis. `` But I fear we may if we do n't get our act together and compete and do it effectively . ''
In the meantime , Atkins is ready to erect a billboard at the Minnesota state line taunting Wisconsinites in their own language : Green Bay Packer talk .
`` 'You may have Aaron Rodgers , but we have the lowest health insurance rates in the country , ' `` he says it would say . Atkins quickly added : `` We 'd be happy to take Aaron Rodgers , too , with the little quarterback issues we 're having these days with the Vikings . But that 's a different discussion . ''","Minnesota has signed up far more people at lower rates on its state-run health insurance exchange than neighboring Wisconsin, which has struggled with the troubled federal government site.

A screen shot of the Minnesota health insurance exchange website. (Photo: screen grab) Story Highlights Minnesota, Wisconsin have vastly difference experiences with Affordable Care Act

Minnesota is signing up thousands on its exchange and at rates far lower than Wisconsin

Reason for large gap in rates is unclear but could be because Minnesota has been more aggressive

WASHINGTON -- When Joe Atkins hunkered down to draft legislation outlining how Minnesota would implement the Affordable Care Act, he had no idea the results would be so dramatic.

The Gopher State is now enrolling individuals through its health-insurance exchange by the thousands and at premium rates that are among the lowest in the country.

Next door in Wisconsin, the numbers of Obamacare enrollees have barely hit the hundreds and rates are between 25 and 35 percent higher than in Minnesota.

""I wish that wasn't the case, but I'm sure glad,"" says Atkins, a Democratic Farm Labor Party state lawmaker. ""Folks are thinking I'm pretty smart right now.""

Minnesotans and Wisconsinites share a long-standing rivalry -- in politics, business, and, of course, on the football field. But the new health law has opened another front in the competition. And so far, Minnesota is ahead.

The reason for the large gap in rates is unclear but could be, in part, because of the more aggressive approach Minnesota has taken to implementing the law.

The most obvious difference between the two states is their exchanges. Minnesota has its own online marketplace where residents and small businesses can shop for and buy insurance, while Wisconsin is relying on the federal government marketplace, which has been plagued with bugs and technical failures and doesn't accommodate small businesses.

If and when the Obama administration fixes that, the rate differentials will remain. And they are stark.

A 50-year-old Minnesotan who lives just south of the Twin Cities in Dakota County can buy a mid-level, silver plan for $241 a month. Just 20 miles away, across the state line in St. Croix County, the lowest cost silver plan available to a 50-year-old Wisconsinite costs nearly three times that price -- $622 a month.

The statewide average for such a plan in Minnesota is $304, compared to $403 in Wisconsin, a Gannett analysis of federal and state data found. Those rates do not take into account the subsidies some lower-income consumers will receive.

The disparity carries through to younger consumers as well. Twenty-seven-year-olds living in Brown, Outagamie or Marathon counties, for example, have to pay roughly the statewide Wisconsin average of around $235 a month for the lowest cost mid-level plan. Over in Minnesota, individuals in their mid-20s can get those plans 36 percent cheaper for $150 on average.

Wisconsin's rates are not just higher than Minnesota's, they're 21 percent higher than the average across 34 states for which the federal government released detailed premium data.

Wisconsin officials acknowledged the rate disparities but said they are confident insurance companies in the state are not overcharging consumers. Deputy Insurance Commissioner Dan Schwartzer pointed to a requirement under the health law that carriers spend 80 percent of premium revenue on medical claims. That limits overhead costs, including administration, salaries and profits, to 20 percent.

""When they submit rates, they know that they've got to stay under the 20 percent cap or they're going to have to refund it back, anyways,"" Schwartzer said in an interview.

He also said premiums have historically been higher in Wisconsin, pointing to a 2012 Health and Human Services Department study that showed private employers in the Badger State paid premiums that were 7 percent higher on average than in Minnesota.

Analysts say premiums are based on a number of factors, from health costs and demographics to market competitiveness. But when it comes to Wisconsin and Minnesota, none of those appears to account for such a wide disparity.

The nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation found that health care costs in the two states are roughly the same. Per capita expenditures were $7,409 in Minnesota versus $7,233 in Wisconsin, according to the most recent data released in 2011 by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. And the costs have grown annually since 1991 at nearly the same rate -- 6.7 percent in Wisconsin and 7 percent in Minnesota.

As for competitiveness, there are only five insurers offering plans on the Minnesota exchange, while there are 13 carriers participating in the Wisconsin exchange.

Cynthia Cox, a policy analyst at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said regulation also plays a role in premium levels.

In Minnesota, regulators forced insurers in several cases to resubmit lower rates because they questioned the justifications for them. In Wisconsin, regulators took a more hands-off approach and let all the rates go through as-is after reviewing carriers' justifications.

Liberal advocacy group Citizen Action Wisconsin pointed to another possible factor in a report it released a few weeks ago: Gov. Scott Walker's decision not to expand Medicaid as much as other states and to transition some 77,000 people off Badgercare and force them to buy insurance on the federal exchange.

The group pointed to an analysis by the nonpartisan Rand Corporation that predicted failing to expand Medicaid would increase rates by 8 to 10 percent for insurance sold on individual exchanges. That's because lower-income individuals tend to be less healthy -- with higher health care costs -- and forcing them onto the exchanges would make the pool of prospective insured less healthy,driving up premiums.

""The fundamental difference between the two states, which are similar geographically and demographically and have very similar underlying medical costs, is that Minnesota has embraced the national health care reform law and is using the tools it provides to deliver more affordable health insurance, while the Walker administration has tried to undermine the law at every turn,"" Citizen Action CEO Robert Kraig and researcher Kevin Kane wrote in a scathing op-ed recently.

But Schwartzer, the Wisconsin deputy insurance commissioner, dismissed that argument, said there is no evidence that the 77,000 individuals leaving Badgercare are unhealthy.

And he said the state's rate-review process was sound. Schwartzer said that actuaries reviewed the rates insurers submitted and didn't find any that appeared out of whack. And he said the Walker administration didn't see any point in brow-beating insurers into offering lower rates when market forces are in play.

""We let them beat each other up versus us beating the insurer up,"" he said. ""Let them beat each other up being competitive against each other.""

Schwartzer pointed to another potential factor in insurers setting higher rates in the state -- the dissolution of the state's high-risk pool, where some 22,000 Wisconsinites with pre-existing conditions and therefore higher health care costs had been getting insurance.

""From an insurer's perspective, the other major factor, other than uninsured population would be those in the high risk pools going into the private market,"" Schwartzer said.

Over in Minnesota, state officials are keeping their high-risk pool open for another year.

Minnesota officials happily point to several other decisions they say resulted in low rates. After the health law passed in March 2010, the state acted quickly to form a task force on implementation and decided to expand Medicaid and set up its own exchange.

""The first motivation is I didn't want the federal government imposing one on us,"" Atkins, the author of Minnesota's implementation law, said in an interview. ""Quite frankly, I expected we would have lower rates if we did it ourselves. And finally, when one has a problem, I prefer to dial a 651 area code rather than a 202 area code.""

Minnesota Commerce Department Spokeswoman Anne O'Connor also points to the rigorous review process that insurers had to go through before Commerce Commissioner Mike Rothman approved plans offered on their exchange.

""In this case, the rates Commissioner Rothman approved for the 141 plans available through MNsure were 4 to 37 percent lower than had originally been filed,"" O'Connor said.

The White House is hoping that Wisconsin and other states will change their minds and join Minnesota in expanding Medicaid. When the program funding health care for the poor and disabled was first passed in 1965, only 26 states initially agreed to participate, but within five years, 48 states had opted in.

""It is our belief that expansion is going to grow because as governors and hospitals and others in respective states look at it, it just makes sense to do it, and it is the right thing to do,"" top Obama aide David Simas said.

Wisconsin officials say revisiting that decision is unlikely.

""The decision's been made,"" Schwartzer said, ""and what we're trying to do is move forward, directed by the governor, with making this work as best as you can make it work for consumers in Wisconsin.""

Whatever the case, some Wisconsinites say the state's entire health care system needs to mount a better challenge to Minnesota.

""I don't want to lose this race,"" said Bob DeVita, CEO of Common Ground Healthcare Cooperative in Brookfield, Wis. ""But I fear we may if we don't get our act together and compete and do it effectively.""

In the meantime, Atkins is ready to erect a billboard at the Minnesota state line taunting Wisconsinites in their own language: Green Bay Packer talk.

"" 'You may have Aaron Rodgers, but we have the lowest health insurance rates in the country,' "" he says it would say. Atkins quickly added: ""We'd be happy to take Aaron Rodgers, too, with the little quarterback issues we're having these days with the Vikings. But that's a different discussion.""

It seems very likely that this is a one-time bump . The upside of these big premium increases is that all those insurers that have been losing money might start to make money .

It ’ s definitely possible in some states that there could be a little spiral , if not a death spiral .
Its really matter of finding an equilibrium , where premiums cover insurers costs , allowing them to earn a little bit of profit , and enrollment is stable .

Why are Obamacare premiums going up so much this year?

Larry Levitt

There are three reasons why premiums are going up so much. The first is that more sick people than anticipated enrolled. Insurers are just catching up to the fact that premiums weren’t covering their costs. It seems somewhat counterintuitive that this is happening four years after the insurance expansion going into effect, but it’s really only now that insurers have good data on who enrolled and how much it cost.

The second reason is the end of the reinsurance program, which helped pay for very sick enrollees. That expires at the end of this year. So they have to raise premiums to account for the end of that program.

The third reason is health care costs seem to be trending back upward. That is affecting Obamacare plans but really all insurance plans.

Sarah Kliff

So when you think about these different factors driving up Obamacare rates, does this strike you as a one-time course correction? Or that we’re at the beginning of an era with bigger Obamacare rate increases?

Larry Levitt

That is absolutely the question of the moment: Is this a one-time bump or a sign of worse things to come? And the shorter answer is we don’t know.

It seems very likely that this is a one-time bump. The upside of these big premium increases is that all those insurers that have been losing money might start to make money. I doubt many people out there would be shedding tears for insurance companies not making money, but these insurance companies have to earn a profit if they’re going to make the program work.

The risk is that premium increases beget more premium increases if some healthy people decide to drop coverage in response to the increases. In the marketplaces, that is not likely to happen because the vast majority are receiving subsidies and are cushioned.

Here is a smaller number, about 15 percent of marketplace enrollees, who are not eligible for subsidies. They will feel the full brunt of the rate hikes, although some of them might become eligible for subsidies because premiums have gotten so high.

The most important group to watch is people buying their own insurance outside of the marketplace, who are playing the full premium. They are getting hit with the increases. If they start to drop insurance, that could lead to bigger premium increases in the future.

Sarah Kliff

They’re most important because they’re paying the full premium and they are most vulnerable to rate increases. By definition these people are generally higher-income. If they were lower-income they would go into the marketplace, although some new analysis suggests some of them might be eligible for subsidies and aren’t claiming them.

Some are sick and are going to hang on to their insurance for dear life. But the group you worry about is people who are healthy, who are buying insurance because they think it’s the right thing to do.

We’re at that point of equilibrium in a number of states where things are working well. We’re not quite at that level of equilibrium of all states.

Sarah Kliff

The Obama administration thinks enrollment on the marketplaces will increase by about 1 million people this coming year. Do you think that’s realistic?

Larry Levitt

It feels ambitious but achievable.

There are two factors working in the administration’s favor. The first is they’ve gotten better at running the program and may have figured out ways to better target outreach efforts.

The second is the individual mandate. The penalty may still prove to be too small to get enough people to buy insurance, but I think people’s knowledge is still catching up as the penalty phases in. It was fully phased in in 2016; many people won’t know that until they file their taxes.

At some point this requires a culture shift, where there is just an expectation that you get health insurance. I think partly, because of the divisive politics around Obamacare, we haven’t yet made that the norm.

Imagine a world where the ACA passed with significant bipartisan support and there was a national effort involving politicians of all stripes and figures, and athletes, all encouraging people to get insured. That is not the world we live in. It’s more like what happened in Massachusetts.

Sarah Kliff

Do you think Obamacare’s mandate is strong enough to make the law work? Or do you think it will need to be strengthened at some point?

Larry Levitt

I think of the mandate as going hand in hand with the subsidies. It is entirely possible that both the mandate penalty and the premium subsidy are too small to make coverage affordable and convince enough people that they should buy it.

The bigger the mandate penalty, though, the more responsibility you have to provide subsidies to make sure the coverage is affordable. We’ve heard talk during the campaign from Secretary Clinton about increasing the subsidies. It wouldn’t be a popular issue to talk about increasing the mandate, but both may need to be bigger.",www.vox.com,left,hOI8Mur5mGmBlY3p

You don’t need a degree in higher math to see that the numbers for President Obama’s health care takeover don’t add up. Obamacare doles out generous subsidies to the elderly in the expectation that healthy young people will pay higher premiums to cover the added costs of insuring the old.

The millennials, to Mr. Obama’s surprise and sorrow, aren’t as credulous as he thought they would be. They haven’t signed up for Obamacare in appreciable numbers. So he’s preparing a bailout, and what he has in mind may be against the law.

Tucked inside the thousand-page Obamacare legislation are provisions guaranteeing profits for insurance companies to entice them to play the government’s game. If insurance firms join the exchanges and pay out more in medical claims than they anticipate, taxpayers would cover their losses.

The administration expected 40 percent of adult enrollees to be under age 35, but so far only 24 percent fit that crucial demographic. A scheme known as “risk corridors” would be used to pay back the private insurance companies for losses plus a 3 percent profit.

Since it never bothered to get an estimate, the administration intends to write a blank check.

A new report by the Congressional Research Service says the White House can’t do that. A bailout for insurers requires action by Congress, in an explicit appropriation of funds.

“Statutory and constitutional provisions,” the congressional analysts found, “prohibit federal agencies from making payments in the absence of a valid appropriation. Under longstanding [Government Accountability Office] interpretations, an appropriation must consist of both a direction to pay and a specified source of funds.”

There has been no such appropriation for “the risk corridor” program. Mr. Obama thinks he has the pen to sign as many checks as he needs to keep his health care scheme afloat.

The debate over the future of the American healthcare system has become a focal point of the Democratic presidential nominating contest. As Trump has failed to make strides to remedy the problem, Democrats are becoming more vocal.

healthcare,USA TODAY,1,http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2014/01/06/johnson-obamacare-subsidies-congress/4341229/,Senator sues to block health care benefits for Congress,2014-01-06,"Donovan Slack, Gannett Washington Bureau","Republicans have argued that transferring federal employee health benefit to health care exchanges is a special exemption for Congress .
Government plans to give subsidies for Congress to buy insurance on exchanges
WASHINGTON — Sen. Ron Johnson , R-Wis. , filed a lawsuit Monday challenging the Obama administration 's decision to provide health insurance subsidies to members of Congress and their staff .
The senator said he believes the decision gives lawmakers special — and illegal — treatment .
Under the Affordable Care Act — widely known as Obamacare — members of Congress and their employees were kicked off their federal health plan and forced to buy insurance through an exchange . The federal Office of Personnel Management issued a rule last September making clear that the federal government would continue to pay the employer contribution for congressional health benefits at the same rate as if members and their staff were still on the federal employee health plan .
Some lawmakers have argued that this amounts to a federal subsidy to pay for coverage that other Americans are not entitled to .
Only Americans who make less than about $ 45,000 annually qualify for federal subsidies . Members of Congress are paid $ 175,000 per year .
`` That 's completely unfair , completely unjust , '' Johnson said at a press conference at the U.S. Capitol .
His lawyers in the case are Paul Clement , a former solicitor general under George W. Bush , and Rick Esenberg , founder and president of the Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty .
The issue may seem petty to some outside the Beltway — liberal critics assailed Johnson when he first talked about suing in October , saying he was trying to deprive his own staff members of health insurance benefits . But to the senator , the case is about more than the subsidies . He said it 's about reining in what he calls presidential overreach .
`` This is , I think , a very important constitutional question , '' said Johnson , who is funding the suit through his campaign committee .
The subsidies for lawmakers and staff were not spelled out in the law itself , and Johnson said he believes it violates the law . `` This lawsuit is about enforcing that law , '' Johnson said .
OPM officials said when they issued the rule that the agency has the authority to administer employee health benefits because members of Congress and their staff are still federal employees . `` It is within OPM 's interpretive authority . . . to clarify that a Government contribution may be provided to , and to establish the means for a Government contribution towards health benefits for , Members of Congress and congressional staff , just as we do for other Federal employees . ''
In order for the case to proceed , Johnson will have to prove he has been harmed by the OPM ruling , he said , giving him grounds to sue .

Government plans to give subsidies for Congress to buy insurance on exchanges

Sen. Johnson says those subsidies violate the law

WASHINGTON — Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., filed a lawsuit Monday challenging the Obama administration's decision to provide health insurance subsidies to members of Congress and their staff.

The senator said he believes the decision gives lawmakers special — and illegal — treatment.

Under the Affordable Care Act — widely known as Obamacare — members of Congress and their employees were kicked off their federal health plan and forced to buy insurance through an exchange. The federal Office of Personnel Management issued a rule last September making clear that the federal government would continue to pay the employer contribution for congressional health benefits at the same rate as if members and their staff were still on the federal employee health plan.

Some lawmakers have argued that this amounts to a federal subsidy to pay for coverage that other Americans are not entitled to.

Only Americans who make less than about $45,000 annually qualify for federal subsidies. Members of Congress are paid $175,000 per year.

""That's completely unfair, completely unjust,"" Johnson said at a press conference at the U.S. Capitol.

His lawyers in the case are Paul Clement, a former solicitor general under George W. Bush, and Rick Esenberg, founder and president of the Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty.

The issue may seem petty to some outside the Beltway — liberal critics assailed Johnson when he first talked about suing in October, saying he was trying to deprive his own staff members of health insurance benefits. But to the senator, the case is about more than the subsidies. He said it's about reining in what he calls presidential overreach.

""This is, I think, a very important constitutional question,"" said Johnson, who is funding the suit through his campaign committee.

The subsidies for lawmakers and staff were not spelled out in the law itself, and Johnson said he believes it violates the law. ""This lawsuit is about enforcing that law,"" Johnson said.

OPM officials said when they issued the rule that the agency has the authority to administer employee health benefits because members of Congress and their staff are still federal employees. ""It is within OPM's interpretive authority . . . to clarify that a Government contribution may be provided to, and to establish the means for a Government contribution towards health benefits for, Members of Congress and congressional staff, just as we do for other Federal employees.""

In order for the case to proceed, Johnson will have to prove he has been harmed by the OPM ruling, he said, giving him grounds to sue. He alleges in the complaint filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Green Bay, Wis., that he and other members of Congress are dealing with an undue administrative burden because they must designate which members of their staff are subject to the change. In addition, the complaint argues that the OPM ruling is forcing him to participate in something that he believes is illegal.

Not all of his GOP colleagues are on board with Johnson's Obamacare suit. Fellow Wisconsin Republican Rep. James Sensenbrenner on Sunday called the lawsuit an ""unfortunate political stunt.""

""Senator Johnson should spend his time legislating rather than litigating as our country is facing big problems that must be addressed by Congress — not the courts,"" Sensenbrenner said. ""All Republicans want to repeal Obamacare, but this politically motivated lawsuit only takes public attention away from how bad all of Obamacare really is and focuses it on a trivial issue. Fortunately, Senator Johnson's suit is likely frivolous and will not achieve the result he's seeking.""

Johnson on Monday said he was ""disappointed"" and ""a little confused"" by Sensenbrenner's reaction, but he said he's moving forward regardless.

""I respectfully disagree,"" he said.

The insurance industry generally does not support any delay in the implementation of the ObamaCare insurance mandates, out of concern that a delay would deprive them of much-needed customers at a time when they're dealing with the cost of additional coverage requirements.

The 17 million people who are covered in the individual health insurance market , where switching of plans and substantial changes in coverage are common , will receive the new protections of the Affordable Care Act sooner rather than later . Roughly 40 percent to two-thirds of people in individual market policies normally change plans within a year .

In issuing the rules , the administration said this was just one goal of the legislation , allowing people to “ keep their current coverage if they like it. ” It acknowledged that some people , especially those who work at smaller businesses , might face significant changes in the terms of their coverage , and it said they should be able to “ reap the benefits of additional consumer protections. ” The law provides a partial exemption for certain health plans in existence on March 23 , when Mr. Obama signed the legislation . Under this provision , known as a grandfather clause , plans can lose the exemption if they make significant changes in deductibles , co-payments or benefits . About half of employer-sponsored health plans will see such changes by the end of 2013 , the administration says in an economic analysis of the rules .

Having an insurance company discontinue an insurance policy is not anything new . And actually , the term “ policy cancellation ” is a misnomer . Generally , an individual health insurance policy is sold via a 12-month contract between the insurer and the consumer . At the end of that contract period , the insurer has the option to discontinue or change that policy - nothing in federal law changes that . Current policyholders are not having their current policy cancelled - rather , the insurance company is exercising its option to discontinue the policy at the end of the contract year .

And , more often than not , insurance companies have done one or all of these things to policyholders . It is part of the reason individual health insurance is often called “ swiss cheese ” coverage compared to employer-based plans - because it 's full of holes . Under HIPAA , an insurer could also decide to discontinue a policy , but if it did so , the law said it must provide the policyholder with at least 90 days notice , must offer the policyholder another new policy as an alternative , and has to treat its policyholders the same , regardless of their health status .

The market for individual insurance is significantly different than that for group coverage . This affects estimates of the proportion of plans that will remain grandfathered until 2014 . As mentioned previously , the individual market is a residual market for those who need insurance but do not have group coverage available and do not qualify for public coverage . For many , the market is transitional , providing a bridge between other types of coverage . One study found a high percentage of individual insurance policies began and ended with employer-sponsored coverage . More importantly , coverage on particular policies tends to be for short periods of time . Reliable data are scant , but a variety of studies indicate that between 40 percent and 67 percent of policies are in effect for less than one year . Although data on changes in benefit packages comparable to that for the group market is not readily available , the high turnover rates described here would dominate benefit changes as the chief source of changes in grandfather status . While a substantial fraction of individual policies are in force for less than one year , a small group of individuals maintain their policies over longer time periods . One study found that 17 percent of individuals maintained their policies for more than two years , while another found that nearly 30 percent maintained policies for more than three years.Using these turnover estimates , a reasonable range for the percentage of individual policies that would terminate , and therefore relinquish their grandfather status , is 40 percent to 67 percent.These estimates assume that the policies that terminate are replaced by new individual policies , and that these new policies are not , by definition , grandfathered .

There ’ s a sense of urgency among GOP lawmakers to come up with a plan to replace the most popular components of ObamaCare after a panel of appellate judges on Tuesday aggressively questioned whether the law passes legal muster following Congress ’ s repeal of the tax penalty for not having insurance .

But on Tuesday , McConnell pledged that the Senate would act swiftly to protect people with pre-existing medical conditions if a GOP-backed lawsuit is successful in overturning ObamaCare .
“ I think the important thing for the public to know is there ’ s nobody in the Senate not in favor of covering pre-existing conditions , ” McConnell said .
“ We would act quickly on a bipartisan basis to restore ” those protections if struck down by the courts , he added .

There’s a sense of urgency among GOP lawmakers to come up with a plan to replace the most popular components of ObamaCare after a panel of appellate judges on Tuesday aggressively questioned whether the law passes legal muster following Congress’s repeal of the tax penalty for not having insurance.

A nullification in the courts could leave millions of people with pre-existing medical conditions without insurance and disrupt coverage for others.

But on Tuesday, McConnell pledged that the Senate would act swiftly to protect people with pre-existing medical conditions if a GOP-backed lawsuit is successful in overturning ObamaCare.

“I think the important thing for the public to know is there’s nobody in the Senate not in favor of covering pre-existing conditions,” McConnell said.

CENTREVILLE, Va. — A race to define Obamacare to the masses began today between the stacks at the Centreville Library. Over pizza in Decatur, Texas. And with a glass of wine in Naples, Fla.

Dozens of communities around the country hosted pro-Obamacare events, convened by the president’s foot soldiers at Organizing for Action. The series is the first salvo in what is fixing to be a month of high-stakes health care spin. When Congress returns from its summer recess in early September, there will be less than a month until Obamacare’s most sweeping coverage programs start signing up customers in new health insurance exchanges.

In the meantime, pro- and anti-Obamacare advocates are plotting to fill the silence any way they can.

That means gatherings like today’s in Centreville — although the slow start here is probably not what OFA organizers had in mind. After a scheduling snafu over the start time, a few people showed up and left before it actually started. Just one volunteer stayed to help work the phone bank for the health law, and the event’s organizer bolted after 20 minutes — although he was bound for another Obamacare event, a house party.

The poor turnout here in Centreville wasn’t necessarily indicative of what’s happening across the country at other OFA events Sunday afternoon and evening, which coincide with President Barack Obama’s birthday. OFA sent out pictures of bigger and more enthusiastic turnout elsewhere, including some events in places like Ohio, Florida and Missouri where volunteer enthusiasm will be needed to overcome state government resistance to implementation. Most of the events were intentionally small-scale — house parties, leafleting near a beach or a farmer’s market, not big rallies.

But in some ways, this suburban community 20 miles from Washington, D.C., captures the national ambivalence about the health law. Centreville is perched on the edge of two congressional districts, a red one represented by Rep. Frank Wolf — an ardent Republican opponent of Obamacare — and a blue one by Rep. Gerry Connolly, one of the health law’s Democratic champions.

The Centreville event’s lone attendee, Lynn Duvall of Fairfax, Va., told POLITICO that it was her family’s own medical burdens that fueled her passion for Obamacare. Duvall’s son Logan has Crohn’s disease and under the law’s provisions can stay on her health plan until he turns 26, next January. Then he’ll be able to get coverage in the health exchange, despite his pre-existing condition.

Without Obamacare, she said, her son’s illness could have devastated their family finances.

“If the Affordable Care Act weren’t there, we would just have to deal with it.

Backers of Obamacare are hoping to generate enough of their own events this summer to counteract any repeat of August 2009, when tea party activists swarmed town hall meetings to try to stop what was then still a health reform bill with a shaky future in Congress.

The tea party did come close to stopping it that summer — and it and its allies in Congress are planning its own high-profile August messaging campaign, promising street rallies, protests, and a reinvigorated call to dismantle Obamacare. It’s a last-ditch push for it as enrollment starts in October, and conservatives are eyeing this fall’s federal-funding battles as their best hope for putting on the brakes.

“The American people don’t want this law,” Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder of Tea Party Patriots, told reporters last week. Martin said her organization would fan out to congressional town halls in August, host a series of street demonstrations and take aim at any lawmaker who won’t support repealing or defunding the law.

Asked whether the full-throttle posture of both sides bodes for an intense August, Martin said she expects “heated debate.”

“Heated debate is what the First Amendment is about, and I think that as Americans we all want peaceable debate and discussion in America — both parties, both sides.” she said. “I have every reason to expect it.”

healthcare,Salon,0,http://www.salon.com/2013/10/14/ignorant_tea_party_outrage_sarah_palins_latest_obamacare_lie/,Ignorant Tea Party outrage: Sarah Palin?s latest Obamacare lie,2013-10-14,,"The Republicans who attack the Affordable Care Act are so twisted in their vulgar logic that they trip themselves up whenever they seek justification from history . At that warped assembly misnamed the “ Values Voter Summit ” last week , Dr. Ben Carson , an African-American neurosurgeon and Fox News contributor , literally called Obamacare “ the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery. ” Recognizing how odd these words must have sounded coming from a person of color , he doubled down : “ And it is slavery , it is , in a way , slavery , because it is making all of us subservient . ”
When outspoken conservatives look for historical analogies in support of their “ Obamascare ” tactics , they always seem to herald their imagined outrage over American slavery . Former Speaker of the New Hampshire House of Representatives William O ’ Brien has compared healthcare reform to the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 . Is granting Americans the right to buy health insurance as destructive to “ personal and individual liberty ” as federal agents being forced to recapture slaves and return them to their southern masters ? When asked to defend his remarks , O ’ Brien later added that both laws allowed the federal government to “ go into states and order individuals and state governments to enforce federal laws in the states. ” ( He foolishly thinks that states can pick and choose which federal laws they will enforce . )
Both Dr. Carson and Speaker O ’ Brien reflect the conservative impulse to exploit people ’ s fears by making anathema what is actually humane progress . They routinely deny actual historical experience and abandon coherent logic . In his speech yesterday , Carson casually segued from slavery to Leninism–yes , it was Lenin , he stressed , who pronounced that socialized medicine was the “ keystone ” to full-blown socialism .
Whatever smacks of “ government takeover ” is fair game for these guys , knowing that fear is currency and media distortions their sure-fire means of controlling minds that are the most susceptible . Which is why they accuse the president of doing what they , in fact , are doing . Carson railed : “ It was never about healthcare ; it was about control. ” Really ? That was President Obama ’ s motive in 2008 and 2009 ?
Is it historical amnesia or something more sinister when conservatives liken healthcare to tyranny and slavery and servitude ? Here ’ s the clownish Sarah Palin on Fox News : “ What Barack Obama seems to want is to go back before those days when we were in different classes based on different incomes , based on color of skin . ”
Yes , Sarah , it ’ s President Obama who wants to return us to the pre-Civil War era , when slavery , racial discrimination , and individual rights were based on the legal definition of whiteness . By her reasoning , the Affordable Care Act returns him to a subordinate status , one of the class of non-citizens who were denied equal rights–let alone high office . The analogy is utterly racist . Ms. Palin and all the sheep-like , tea-besotted haters who take in this garbage are unable to escape their netherworld . The fact is that no one has to return the United States to an era “ when we were different classes , ” as she puts it , because we have a thriving and unequal class system right now . It is based on the concentration of wealth within giant corporations ; it is reflected in the riches that allow CEOs and paid lobbyists to make government policy . Our unequal class system enables the ruling elite class–the only people who could directly identify with Mitt Romney–to pay a lower tax rate than schoolteachers and nurses .
The Affordable Care Act is indeed about class difference , but not in the way the Republican talking heads pretend .

Oh wait , don ’ t they have universal government healthcare up there ?","The Republicans who attack the Affordable Care Act are so twisted in their vulgar logic that they trip themselves up whenever they seek justification from history. At that warped assembly misnamed the “Values Voter Summit” last week, Dr. Ben Carson, an African-American neurosurgeon and Fox News contributor, literally called Obamacare “the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery.” Recognizing how odd these words must have sounded coming from a person of color, he doubled down: “And it is slavery, it is, in a way, slavery, because it is making all of us subservient.”

When outspoken conservatives look for historical analogies in support of their “Obamascare” tactics, they always seem to herald their imagined outrage over American slavery. Former Speaker of the New Hampshire House of Representatives William O’Brien has compared healthcare reform to the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. Is granting Americans the right to buy health insurance as destructive to “personal and individual liberty” as federal agents being forced to recapture slaves and return them to their southern masters? When asked to defend his remarks, O’Brien later added that both laws allowed the federal government to “go into states and order individuals and state governments to enforce federal laws in the states.” (He foolishly thinks that states can pick and choose which federal laws they will enforce.)

Both Dr. Carson and Speaker O’Brien reflect the conservative impulse to exploit people’s fears by making anathema what is actually humane progress. They routinely deny actual historical experience and abandon coherent logic. In his speech yesterday, Carson casually segued from slavery to Leninism–yes, it was Lenin, he stressed, who pronounced that socialized medicine was the “keystone” to full-blown socialism.

Whatever smacks of “government takeover” is fair game for these guys, knowing that fear is currency and media distortions their sure-fire means of controlling minds that are the most susceptible. Which is why they accuse the president of doing what they, in fact, are doing. Carson railed: “It was never about healthcare; it was about control.” Really? That was President Obama’s motive in 2008 and 2009?

Is it historical amnesia or something more sinister when conservatives liken healthcare to tyranny and slavery and servitude? Here’s the clownish Sarah Palin on Fox News: “What Barack Obama seems to want is to go back before those days when we were in different classes based on different incomes, based on color of skin.”

Yes, Sarah, it’s President Obama who wants to return us to the pre-Civil War era, when slavery, racial discrimination, and individual rights were based on the legal definition of whiteness. By her reasoning, the Affordable Care Act returns him to a subordinate status, one of the class of non-citizens who were denied equal rights–let alone high office. The analogy is utterly racist. Ms. Palin and all the sheep-like, tea-besotted haters who take in this garbage are unable to escape their netherworld. The fact is that no one has to return the United States to an era “when we were different classes,” as she puts it, because we have a thriving and unequal class system right now. It is based on the concentration of wealth within giant corporations; it is reflected in the riches that allow CEOs and paid lobbyists to make government policy. Our unequal class system enables the ruling elite class–the only people who could directly identify with Mitt Romney–to pay a lower tax rate than schoolteachers and nurses.

The Affordable Care Act is indeed about class difference, but not in the way the Republican talking heads pretend. Obamacare aims to help those regular, hardworking people whom Republicans dismiss as deadbeats. New Hampshire’s motto “Live free or die” can be construed as the Republicans’ “survival of the fittest” ideology: those who hate Affordable Care evidently intend for financially strapped Americans, debtors, the sick with hospital bills, the poor without insurance, to sink or swim. By professing that America’s healthcare system is being ruined by Romneycare, Obamacare, or whatever you want to call it, these critics are saying that people who have insurance should not give a hoot about those without it.

The state does not have enough doctors and other health care workers to care for all the new beneficiaries , experts say , and state officials worry about the costs .
“ The expansion of Medicaid is a sea change , and it ’ s occurring at the most difficult fiscal time in the history of the program , ” said the Medicaid director in Arkansas , R. Andrew Allison , who is the president of the National Association of Medicaid Directors . “ States are preoccupied with the challenge of sustaining the Medicaid program we already have . ”
Arkansas officials have discussed cutting Medicaid services in the coming year to help close a gap between Medicaid costs and expected state appropriations . The gap — up to $ 400 million — represents more than one-fourth of state spending on the program .
Medicaid is jointly financed by the federal government and the states , with Washington paying 50 percent of the costs in higher-income states and about 70 percent in lower-income states like Arkansas . States have historically had leeway to define eligibility and benefits within guidelines set by federal law .
Under the new law , the federal government will pay the full cost of covering those newly eligible for Medicaid for three years , from 2014 to 2016 , and the federal share will then gradually decline to 90 percent in 2020 and later years . Administration officials say this is a good deal for states , but it may ultimately create new costs for states . Many state officials also worry that Congress will reduce the federal share and shift more costs to the states .
“ There is uncertainty , very commonly conveyed to me by states , that the law as written now will somehow have to change to address the federal government ’ s fiscal crisis , ” Mr. Allison said .
In challenging the constitutionality of the new health care law , 26 states have asserted that Congress can not force them to make such a large expansion of Medicaid .

Arkansas officials expect the Medicaid rolls to grow by more than 35 percent , to 925,000 , from 675,000 . Here , as in other states , most of the new Medicaid beneficiaries are expected to be adults .
Arkansas has taken significant steps to insure more children in recent years , under Gov . Mike Beebe , a Democrat , and his predecessor , Mike Huckabee , a Republican , who signed a bill creating an insurance program for children in 1997 , five months before the federal program for children was established .
In the 15 years since then , the proportion of Arkansas children lacking coverage has been cut by more than half . But coverage of parents and other adults lags far behind . Some Arkansas adults have children covered by Medicaid or the Children ’ s Health Insurance Program but are themselves uninsured .
Heather D. Clubbs said that her children — a 14-year-old daughter and two sons , ages 8 and 15 — went regularly to doctors and dentists here for services covered by Medicaid . But Ms. Clubbs , who earns $ 9.71 an hour as a nurse ’ s aide at a nursing home , said she could not afford coverage for herself , which would take $ 200 a month out of her paycheck .
“ I would go to the doctor more often if I had health insurance , ” Ms. Clubbs said . “ I try not to go to the doctor at all . ”
Current Medicaid eligibility rules are notoriously complicated , and to qualify a person must fit into one of several dozen categories . “ It ’ s a very common misconception that Medicaid covers all poor people , but that ’ s far from the truth , ” Mr. Allison said .
In Arkansas , parents generally can not qualify for Medicaid if their family income is more than 25 percent of the poverty level ( in other words , more than $ 4,770 a year for a family of three ) , and childless adults generally can not qualify unless they are disabled .
The new health care law will simplify eligibility , sweeping away many of those categories in favor of a single standard . People under 65 will generally qualify for Medicaid if their income is less than or equal to 133 percent of the federal poverty level ( up to $ 25,390 for a family of three ) .
In addition to the costs , state officials here are not sure how they will cope with the expected surge in people eligible for Medicaid , given that doctors and nurses are scarce in some counties .
Dr. Steven F. Collier , the chief executive of a network of community health centers known as ARcare , said : “ The new health care law is a good thing . But if it is ruled constitutional , there will be some practical problems , and access to care is No . 1 . If you give people health insurance and they do not have access to a doctor or health care , what difference will that make ? ”
Darren Caldwell , chief executive of DeWitt Hospital in DeWitt , Ark. , said : “ I worry that the Medicaid card will be like Confederate money . You won ’ t have anywhere to use it , and it won ’ t be worth anything . ”
Sip B. Mouden , chief executive of Community Health Centers of Arkansas , whose members operate 75 clinics in the state , said : “ A lot of our community health centers are at capacity right now . An insurance card does not guarantee access to a regular source of primary and preventive care . ”
Arkansas , like many states , plans to train more doctors , physician assistants and other health care workers . But the supply is expected to fall short of the demand , and Dr. Daniel W.

Adam Hergenreder , 18 , of Gurnee , can not breathe without oxygen tubes since being admitted Saturday to a hospital in Libertyville with a “ vaping-induced acute lung injury , ” the Chicago Tribune reports .
The teen — who started vaping at 16 , with mint and mango his preferred flavors — told the newspaper he ignored warnings to stop from teachers , parents and health officials until it was nearly too late . He was rushed to the hospital after days of uncontrolled vomiting — and faces up to months of recovery , with the possibility of permanent damage to his lungs from scarring due to inflammation .
“ People just see that little pod and think , how could that do anything to my body ? ” Hergenreder said Tuesday from Advocate Condell Medical Center . “ I ’ m glad I could be an example and show people that [ vaping products ] aren ’ t good at all . They will mess up your lungs . ”

More On This...

The Senate is about to hold a test vote on a bill that would both fund the government past Sept. 30 and defund the health care law, though Reid is expected to quickly strip the ObamaCare language.

No one is prepared to challenge Ryan for his job, said GOP lawmakers from across the Republican Conference. While some right-wing media and outside groups are agitating to replace the speaker, and his antagonists on the White House staff needle him anonymously in the press, there is no way he will be ousted.

President Donald Trump hasn't turned on him, either — at least not yet. And Ryan remains popular with his rank-and-file members, who genuinely like him. Critically, Ryan is not a liability for them back home, the ultimate litmus test for any congressional leader.

Yet the debacle over the American Health Care Act showed how the promise of Ryan as speaker has failed to live up to the reality.

When he took over for former Speaker John Boehner in November 2015 following an uprising by conservatives, Ryan was seen as the one figure who could heal the divisions within the GOP Conference, especially with the hard-line Freedom Caucus. That hasn't happened, to put it mildly.

Ryan is still struggling with the same stubborn political dynamic that torpedoed Boehner's career. On big issues, if Ryan gives into the Freedom Caucus, he alienates more moderate members of his party and loses any ability to work with Democrats. If he tries to cut a deal with Democrats and his own moderates, the Freedom Caucus goes ballistic, attacking him in tandem with its allies in right-wing media and conservative outside groups.

It's a lose-lose proposition.

Having a Republican in the White House was supposed to finally tame the group. It was easy to blow up deals Republicans were attempting to cut with Barack Obama; Donald Trump, the thinking went, would never tolerate it. The health-care debate showed how wrong that was.

So Ryan remains stuck in the same intra-party dysfunction.

""He's a really nice guy, a really smart guy,"" said a veteran GOP lawmaker who asked not to be named. But ""he can't seal the deal, which is a real problem.""

Even with Trump, the ""ultimate closer,"" in the White House.

Things won't get any easier for Ryan. He will now have to find a way to deliver on Trump's border wall, which Democrats have vowed to block. The possibility of a government shutdown looms in late April and again in October unless Republicans can figure out how to keep funding going. The debt ceiling has to be increased this summer, always a tough vote for GOP lawmakers. An expensive infrastructure package that conservatives hate will require Democratic buy-in.

That's to say nothing of the next daunting item on the GOP to-do list, tax reform — arguably tougher to pull off than health-care legislation.

Ryan put his personal prestige on the line to pass his health care legislation, publicly and privately exhorting his colleagues to support it. Ryan became the face of the legislation, figuring he could sell it better than anyone else. In the end, enough of his own members rejected the proposal to bring it down.

I met with their chairman earlier today, and he made it clear to me that the votes weren't going to be there from their team. That was sufficient to have this bill not pass.""

Trump, for his part, praised Ryan despite the failure to pass the health care bill, which leaves Obamacare in place as the law of the land.

""I like Speaker Ryan. He worked very hard,"" Trump told reporters in the White House after the bill was pulled. ""I'm not going to speak badly about anybody within the Republican Party. Certainly there's a history, but I really think Paul worked hard.""

Freedom Caucus members said they don't blame Ryan for the failure, at least not publicly.

“Paul Ryan, he’ a very good man. He’s an eloquent speaker. He is an excellent representative of the GOP Conference as a whole,"" said Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.). ""I like the job he’s doing and I want him to stay as speaker of the House. And I ‘ve heard nothing to the contrary.""

Other rank-and-file members were equally supportive as they left town to lick their wounds.

""If you know of someone who cares more, works harder, who’s brighter, who’s more committed to lead this institution, give me their name,"" said Rep. Rob Woodall (R-Ala.), a Ryan loyalist. ""We go through leaders like we’re changing shirts. I don’t think it reflects on the leadership, I think it reflects on us.”

Yet Ryan faces the prospect for the rest of this Congress — unless he moves decisively to the middle — that members may need to get signoff from the Freedom Caucus and its chairman, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), before they move major legislation. Or at least to know that the Freedom Caucus won't try to kill their bill. It's a dynamic that will be a huge challenge for Ryan as he tries to get past the Obamacare reversal.

Both Ryan and Trump emphasized they want to move quickly on to tax reform, although the failure to replace Obamacare leaves them with $1 trillion less to use for that fight, as there will be less room to cut taxes without ballooning the deficit.

""Yes, this does make tax reform more difficult, but it does not in any way make it impossible,"" Ryan acknowledged.

But Ryan, a former chairman of the Ways and Means Committe, said it will be easier to get Republicans to agree on taxes than on health care. ""I don't think this is prologue for other future things because there are other parts of our agenda that people have even more agreement on what to achieve.""

The Department of Health and Human Services — it’s the “human” part that is the root of the problem — won’t say what’s wrong with the system, only that the website needs “a new code that includes bug fixes.”

Most people say it needs a new health care plan and a new website. Other computer geeks — who sound like they know what they’re talking about, but how do the rest of us know? — insist the problem is fundamental, that the designers of the website used 10-year-old software schemes. Ten years in computer years is a calculation from two centuries back, and for all a computer would know, Matthew Brady sent his photographs from Gettysburg on an Apple IIE, working on DOS with only 64 kilobytes.

Obamacare, which the president says he wants to be the “signature” of his presidency, seems designed to fail, and it’s the signature answer to the question of what’s wrong with Mr. Obama and his presidency. Critics who have been saying he’s dangerous because he’s a Muslim, a socialist, a Kenyan, or an un-American ingrate miss the point by a mile.

PHOTOS: Obama: 'Nobody is madder than me' about Obamacare website woes

Mr. Obama may be a Christian patriot who is secretly proud of his Confederate forbears on his mother’s side (out of Kentucky through Kansas), but his sin is not alien ideology, but native incompetence. The only thing he has done well is organize an administration that reflects the consistent incompetence that underlies everything the administration does. Mr. Obama can’t blame George W. Bush for his administration, but he probably does.

When the telephone rang at 3 o’clock in the morning, and it was Benghazi calling, he turned over and went back to sleep. He drew a network of red lines across Syria, daring Bashar Assad to cross one of them, and when he did, the president turned American foreign policy in the Middle East over to Vladimir Putin and hoped for the best.

A onetime University of Chicago law professor ought to know better, but every time there’s an unfortunate incident on the street with high headline potential, whether in high-minded Massachusetts or high-cracker Florida, the president can’t resist putting in his two cents’ worth and suggesting that the judge should take his word and send the jury home.

Mr. Obama took pride of paternity when Mitt Romney called the health care scheme “Obamacare,” and the president assured him that he need not apologize, because he liked the label. Now nearly every Democrat in town takes care to call it the Affordable Care Act, its formal name.

The president is right to call in the high-tech geeks. If they can’t fix it before the first of the year (barely two months from now), he’ll have to ask for the postponement he so vehemently said was impossible. It’s either that or fine everybody for not signing up for something impossible to sign up for.

This is a first in train wrecks. This train hit a southbound freight before it ever got out of the station. Some engineer. Some conductor. Americans will forgive a president a lot, even his politics, if they like the man. They’re not so forgiving of incompetence, impotence and inefficiency.

Some of Mr. Obama’s severest critics got one thing right. They say his health care scheme was the work of Marxists, and so it is, writ large by Groucho, Chico and Harpo.

healthcare,Reason,2,http://reason.com/blog/2018/06/08/the-trump-administration-wont-defend-oba,The Trump Administration Won’t Defend Obamacare’s Individual Mandate In Court,2018-06-08,"Peter Suderman, Josh Blackman, Eric Boehm, Zuri Davis, Ilya Somin, Elizabeth Nolan Brown, Jacob Sullum, Shikha Dalmia","The Trump administration wo n't defend Obamacare 's individual mandate to purchase health insurance in court . Instead it will argue that the mandate is unconstitutional—and so are the health law 's preexisting conditions rules .
It 's an unusual , though not unprecedented , move . ( The Obama administration , for example , declined to defend the Defense of Marriage Act . ) And the mandate wo n't go without a defense ; a coalition of blue states will represent Obamacare in court . It 's also clear that the decision comes straight from the top : A Department of Justice letter announcing the decision begins by saying that it was made `` with the approval of the President . ''
The real problem is that the Trump administration 's argument is unlikely to hold up to legal scrutiny .
The White House 's decision , unveiled in a brief tonight , follows a legal challenge to Obamacare brought by a group of conservative states , led by Texas . Those states argue that Obamacare 's purchase requirement is now unconstitutional based on the logic outlined by the Supreme Court when it upheld the mandate in 2012—and that , as a result , the entire law should be struck down .
When the Supreme Court upheld the mandate , it ruled that the mandate was unconstitutional as an economic command to purchase insurance ; the Commerce Clause of the Constitution does not extend that far . Instead , Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority ruling , the mandate was constitutionally permissible under a saving construction—by viewing it as a tax penalty that raised revenue for the federal government .
But the tax reform law passed by Republicans in Congress eliminated that tax penalty , setting it to zero as of 2019 . Technically , the mandate remains on the books , but functionally the tax law repealed it . Since the mandate no longer raises any revenue , the states ' argument goes , the saving construction—that is , the notion that it is legal if understood as a tax—no longer applies . And since the mandate is the lynchpin of the entire law , the glue that holds the entire scheme together , all of Obamacare must be struck down with it .
Typically , the executive branch defends federal laws in court . But in this case , the Trump administration decided to side partially with the states in court . Although the federal government does not argue that the entire law should be struck down , the administration 's brief does make the case that the mandate is unconstitutional , and that the law 's preexisting conditions rules should be struck down as well . The government cites Obama administration arguments to the effect that the mandate and the preexisting conditions rules are inseparable , according to congressional findings associated with the law . ( Notably , the Trump administration 's argument , if it succeeded , would allow Obamacare 's Medicaid expansion , health insurance exchanges , and the private insurance subsidies to stay in place . )
There may be some appeal in the turnabout of using the awkward logic of John Roberts ' Supreme Court against the law that it was designed to save . But I do not think it has much of a chance , for several reasons .
The first is that it will be hard for the states challenging Obamacare to demonstrate standing , given that standing to sue requires a demonstration of harm . The mandate penalty is zero , so who , exactly , is it harming ?

Instead it will argue that the mandate is unconstitutional—and so are the health law's preexisting conditions rules.

It's an unusual, though not unprecedented, move. (The Obama administration, for example, declined to defend the Defense of Marriage Act.) And the mandate won't go without a defense; a coalition of blue states will represent Obamacare in court. It's also clear that the decision comes straight from the top: A Department of Justice letter announcing the decision begins by saying that it was made ""with the approval of the President.""

The real problem is that the Trump administration's argument is unlikely to hold up to legal scrutiny.

The White House's decision, unveiled in a brief tonight, follows a legal challenge to Obamacare brought by a group of conservative states, led by Texas. Those states argue that Obamacare's purchase requirement is now unconstitutional based on the logic outlined by the Supreme Court when it upheld the mandate in 2012—and that, as a result, the entire law should be struck down.

When the Supreme Court upheld the mandate, it ruled that the mandate was unconstitutional as an economic command to purchase insurance; the Commerce Clause of the Constitution does not extend that far. Instead, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority ruling, the mandate was constitutionally permissible under a saving construction—by viewing it as a tax penalty that raised revenue for the federal government.

But the tax reform law passed by Republicans in Congress eliminated that tax penalty, setting it to zero as of 2019. Technically, the mandate remains on the books, but functionally the tax law repealed it. Since the mandate no longer raises any revenue, the states' argument goes, the saving construction—that is, the notion that it is legal if understood as a tax—no longer applies. And since the mandate is the lynchpin of the entire law, the glue that holds the entire scheme together, all of Obamacare must be struck down with it.

Typically, the executive branch defends federal laws in court. But in this case, the Trump administration decided to side partially with the states in court. Although the federal government does not argue that the entire law should be struck down, the administration's brief does make the case that the mandate is unconstitutional, and that the law's preexisting conditions rules should be struck down as well. The government cites Obama administration arguments to the effect that the mandate and the preexisting conditions rules are inseparable, according to congressional findings associated with the law. (Notably, the Trump administration's argument, if it succeeded, would allow Obamacare's Medicaid expansion, health insurance exchanges, and the private insurance subsidies to stay in place.)

There may be some appeal in the turnabout of using the awkward logic of John Roberts' Supreme Court against the law that it was designed to save. But I do not think it has much of a chance, for several reasons.

The first is that it will be hard for the states challenging Obamacare to demonstrate standing, given that standing to sue requires a demonstration of harm. The mandate penalty is zero, so who, exactly, is it harming?

The second, as Jonathan Adler, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University, recently argued in a Federalist Society debate, is that it's very difficult to make the case that the mandate cannot be severed from the rest of Obamacare when Congress has, in effect, already done exactly that.

Yes, the mandate remains part of the law. However, by zeroing out the penalty as part of the tax law, the current Congress effectively declared that the mandate is severable from the rest of the law; courts are unlikely to decide that Congress was wrong that the rest of the law cannot stand apart from the mandate.

`` We have heard concerns about the complexity of the requirements and the need for more time to implement them effectively , '' Treasury Assistant Secretary Mark Mazur said in a blog post . `` We have listened to your feedback and we are taking action . ''
Business groups were jubilant . `` A pleasant surprise , '' said Randy Johnson , senior vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce . There was no inkling in advance of the administration 's action , he said .
`` We commend the administration 's wise move , '' said Neil Trautwein , a vice president of the National Retail Federation . It `` will provide employers and businesses more time to update their health care coverage without threat of arbitrary punishment . ''

Most medium-sized and large businesses already offer health insurance and the requirement was expected to have the biggest consequences for major chain hotels , restaurants , and retail stores that employ many low-wage workers .

Business groups complained since the law passed that the provision was too complicated . For instance , the law created a new definition of full-time workers , those putting in 30 hours or more . It also included two separate requirements , one to provide coverage and another that coverage be deemed `` affordable '' under the law . Violations of either one exposed employers to fines .

Sen. John Thune , R-S.D. , who flagged the obscure rule change after it was filed in the Federal Register ( see page 70 ) , blasted the exemption as `` crony capitalism at its worst . ''
`` Unions are now experiencing the ugly reality of this law , and they want out , '' he said in a statement .
Indeed , the AFL-CIO has fought against what is known as the `` reinsurance fee '' in the Affordable Care Act . The temporary fee would kick in next year and is meant to raise $ 25 billion over three years , to help pay for the cost of people with pre-existing conditions signing up for coverage through the ObamaCare exchanges .
The proposal filed Monday would exempt certain self-insured plans -- those that do not use a third-party administrator for core functions -- for 2015 and 2016 .
Republicans charge this is aimed at unions ' so-called Taft-Hartley plans , though union officials had downplayed the change and suggested some of their plans would n't be eligible anyway .
AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said earlier this month -- when the administration first telegraphed that it might craft the exemption -- that the change does not single out the union insurance policies , according to The Associated Press .
A Health and Human Services official also disputed the claim that this is directed at unions .
`` This definition would exempt any self-insured group health plan that does not use a third party administrator for claims processing or enrollment , not only union plans , '' the official told FoxNews.com , adding they are proposing the change to better `` align '' the definition with the law . `` The phrase 'self-insured , self-administered plans ' is not synonymous with multiemployer plans , or Taft-Hartley plans .

But Republicans say the change is clearly aimed at unions , particularly after labor leaders made a high-profile push to extract some relief from the health care law .
Trumka and other labor leaders met with President Obama and Vice President Biden at the White House in September , as part of a bid to win additional health care subsidies for their workers . The administration determined it could not give them any more subsidies , but later made clear it would look at providing relief from the so-called reinsurance fee .

But as health care costs have soared, many states are struggling to pay for their existing Medicaid programs, which have edged out education to become the largest share of state spending. And states are nervous about counting on the federal government, as Washington is consumed by talk of spending cuts. Gov. Tom Corbett of Pennsylvania, a Republican, asked, “What’s it going to cost the people of Pennsylvania?”

The uncertainty was clear at a news conference of the Democratic Governors Association.

Gov. Peter Shumlin of Vermont, a strong supporter of the expansion, had just finished exhorting governors from both parties to “have a spine” and declare whether or not they would take the federal money and expand their Medicaid programs, when Gov.

Republicans in the chamber have been working for weeks behind closed doors on legislation aimed at repealing and replacing major portions of the Affordable Care Act, former Democratic President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law, popularly known as Obamacare.

The effort has been plagued from the start by tensions between moderates and conservatives, which surfaced again on Tuesday. Democrats have also criticized the behind-the-scenes meetings, staging a protest on the Senate floor on Monday.

“Republicans are writing their healthcare bill under the cover of darkness because they are ashamed of it,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer charged.

President Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to repeal Obamacare. The 2010 law extended insurance coverage to millions of Americans through both subsidized private insurance and an expansion of Medicaid.

The Republican-controlled House of Representatives narrowly approved its version of repeal last month.

Trump has urged the Republican-led Senate to pass a more “generous” bill than that approved by the House, whose version he privately called “mean,” according to congressional sources.

Don’t blink first.

That’s the strategy President Barack Obama and Capitol Hill Democrats are pursuing as the nation faces a government shutdown, a historic default on its debt and the final phase of Obamacare.

Story Continued Below

Obama’s domestic agenda — headed up by infrastructure spending, gun control and immigration reform — has long since stalled. Now, with the basic functions of government on the line again, he’s defining his goal as not giving any more ground to House Republicans — no budget cuts and no concessions on the Affordable Care Act or the debt limit.

Obamacare, the crown jewel of the president’s legislative legacy, is truly non-negotiable for the administration, according to Democrats privy to conversations behind closed doors at the White House and on Capitol Hill.

healthcare,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/sep/22/john-mccain-opposes-last-ditch-obamacare-repeal/,McCain says no on last-ditch Obamacare repeal,2017-09-22,Tom Howell Jr.,"Sen. John McCain of Arizona said Thursday he can not support the GOP ’ s last-ditch plan to replace Obamacare , likely dooming the effort and President Trump ’ s pursuit of a major legislative victory .
Mr. McCain , a Republican , was among three senators who killed off the repeal effort in July , but GOP leaders hoped he would back a plan sponsored by his good pal , Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana .
In a statement , Mr. McCain said the plan was being rushed through without a sober analysis of its impact .
“ I can not in good conscience vote for the Graham-Cassidy proposal , ” he said . “ I believe we could do better working together , Republicans and Democrats , and have not yet really tried . Nor could I support it without knowing how much it will cost , how it will effect insurance premiums , and how many people will be helped or hurt by it . ”
Republicans must pin down 50 votes to pass the plan before a Sept. 30 deadline to act under the 2017 budget .
Its arcane rules allow the GOP to avoid a Democratic filibuster , with Vice President Mike Pence acting as tie-breaker .
Yet Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky has refused to back the proposal , saying it leaves too much of Obamacare in place , and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine has voiced concerns , meaning GOP leaders probably won ’ t be able to scrape together enough votes .
The plan isn ’ t dead just yet , though Mrs. Collins told Maine voters on Friday she was “ leaning against the bill , ” according to the Portland Press-Herald .
Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska , who joined Mr. McCain and Mrs. Collins in blocking the July effort , is also a hard sell for GOP leaders .
Bill sponsors had exuded confidence in recent days , saying they were getting closer by the day to pinning down needed support , and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced he planned to bring the bill to the floor .
But Mr. McCain said his colleagues were emphasizing next week ’ s deadline over thoughtful reforms .
“ I would consider supporting legislation similar to that offered by my friends Senators Graham and [ Bill ] Cassidy were it the product of extensive hearings , debate and amendment , ” he said . “ But that has not been the case . Instead , the specter of September 30th budget reconciliation deadline has hung over this entire process . ”
The wily Senate “ maverick , ” who is being treated for brain cancer , said Democrats made the same mistake when they muscled through the Affordable Care Act without support from a single Republican .
If Republicans follow suit , he warned , “ our success could be as short-lived as theirs when the political winds shift , as they regularly do . ”
Under the Graham-Cassidy bill , Obamacare money that pays for Obamacare ’ s expansion of Medicaid and that subsidizes coverage for many of those who buy insurance on the exchanges would be pooled and instead given to states as block grants . The states would tailor the money to their own health care plans starting in 2020 .
The plan repealed the most unpopular part of Obamacare — the individual mandate requiring Americans to hold insurance or pay a tax . States could restore the mandate or find another spur to get people covered .
Mr. McCain ’ s home-state governor , Doug Ducey , backed the plan earlier this week , but at least six GOP governors balked , saying it would slash funding to their states through 2026 .
Democrats , who increasingly feared their defense of Obamacare has run out of gas , reacted to Mr. McCain ’ s decision with glee .
“ Good news : 1:50 PM Eastern time , Senator John McCain thumbs down on Graham-Cassidy ! ” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi wrote to colleagues .
Mr. McCain , meanwhile , stressed he took no pleasure in opposing his colleagues ’ plans .
“ Far from it . The bill ’ s authors are my dear friends , and I think the world of them . I know they are acting consistently with their beliefs and sense of what is best for the country . So am I , ” he said . “ I hope that in the months ahead , we can join with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to arrive at a compromise solution that is acceptable to most of us , and serves the interests of Americans as best we can . ”

John McCain of Arizona said Thursday he cannot support the GOP’s last-ditch plan to replace Obamacare, likely dooming the effort and President Trump’s pursuit of a major legislative victory.

Mr. McCain, a Republican, was among three senators who killed off the repeal effort in July, but GOP leaders hoped he would back a plan sponsored by his good pal, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana.

In a statement, Mr. McCain said the plan was being rushed through without a sober analysis of its impact.

“I cannot in good conscience vote for the Graham-Cassidy proposal,” he said. “I believe we could do better working together, Republicans and Democrats, and have not yet really tried. Nor could I support it without knowing how much it will cost, how it will effect insurance premiums, and how many people will be helped or hurt by it.”

Republicans must pin down 50 votes to pass the plan before a Sept. 30 deadline to act under the 2017 budget.

Its arcane rules allow the GOP to avoid a Democratic filibuster, with Vice President Mike Pence acting as tie-breaker.

Yet Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky has refused to back the proposal, saying it leaves too much of Obamacare in place, and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine has voiced concerns, meaning GOP leaders probably won’t be able to scrape together enough votes.

The plan isn’t dead just yet, though Mrs. Collins told Maine voters on Friday she was “leaning against the bill,” according to the Portland Press-Herald.

Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who joined Mr. McCain and Mrs. Collins in blocking the July effort, is also a hard sell for GOP leaders.

Bill sponsors had exuded confidence in recent days, saying they were getting closer by the day to pinning down needed support, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced he planned to bring the bill to the floor.

But Mr. McCain said his colleagues were emphasizing next week’s deadline over thoughtful reforms.

“I would consider supporting legislation similar to that offered by my friends Senators Graham and [Bill] Cassidy were it the product of extensive hearings, debate and amendment,” he said. “But that has not been the case. Instead, the specter of September 30th budget reconciliation deadline has hung over this entire process.”

The wily Senate “maverick,” who is being treated for brain cancer, said Democrats made the same mistake when they muscled through the Affordable Care Act without support from a single Republican.

If Republicans follow suit, he warned, “our success could be as short-lived as theirs when the political winds shift, as they regularly do.”

Under the Graham-Cassidy bill, Obamacare money that pays for Obamacare’s expansion of Medicaid and that subsidizes coverage for many of those who buy insurance on the exchanges would be pooled and instead given to states as block grants. The states would tailor the money to their own health care plans starting in 2020.

The plan repealed the most unpopular part of Obamacare — the individual mandate requiring Americans to hold insurance or pay a tax. States could restore the mandate or find another spur to get people covered.

Mr. McCain’s home-state governor, Doug Ducey, backed the plan earlier this week, but at least six GOP governors balked, saying it would slash funding to their states through 2026.

Democrats, who increasingly feared their defense of Obamacare has run out of gas, reacted to Mr. McCain’s decision with glee.

“Good news: 1:50 PM Eastern time, Senator John McCain thumbs down on Graham-Cassidy!” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi wrote to colleagues.

Mr. McCain, meanwhile, stressed he took no pleasure in opposing his colleagues’ plans.

“Far from it. The bill’s authors are my dear friends, and I think the world of them. I know they are acting consistently with their beliefs and sense of what is best for the country. So am I,” he said. “I hope that in the months ahead, we can join with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to arrive at a compromise solution that is acceptable to most of us, and serves the interests of Americans as best we can.”

Mr. Graham said his friendship with Mr. McCain is based on how he’s lived his life — not the votes he takes — but that he “respectfully disagrees” with the Arizonan.

“We press on,” Mr. Graham said.

The Senate Finance Committee is scheduled to hold a hearing on the bill Monday. Also, the Congressional Budget Office is expected to release top-line numbers on how the plan would affect spending, though a comprehensive analysis isn’t expected for weeks.

The Senate Health Committee had been working on a bipartisan bill to stabilize the individual insurance market before Obamacare enrollment begins Nov. 1. Insurers are supposed to ink contracts to participate in the marketplace before the end of the month.

The potential collapse of the GOP push, coupled with Mr. Trump’s ambivalence toward his predecessor’s signature program, leaves the insurance markets in limbo.

Obamacare fires are flaring up all over — in Hill hearings, in scary headlines about big rate hikes and in closed-door meetings of nervous Democrats.

The White House response: We’ll get to that.

Story Continued Below

President Barack Obama’s messaging gurus and their allies say they will step on the gas before enrollment begins this fall, but the effort, they concede, is not in full swing.

Obama’s allies know the health care law needs a massive outreach effort, but Obamacare Round 2 is already starting to look a lot like Round 1, when Democrats roundly accused the White House of botching its appeal to the public, giving Republicans the upper hand on defining the law.

It’s a clear contrast with the immigration reform effort, where the rollout has been filled with business and advocacy groups praising the Gang of Eight bill and quickly knocking down any attacks. This week, there has been plenty of fodder for GOP critics of the health care law but mostly silence from the administration.

Part of that is because the White House team is in flux. Tara McGuinness, who just joined the White House to run the messaging of the law, told POLITICO that her shop is “ramping up on the health care communications and outreach.”

She pointed out that Democratic senators met with White House chief of staff Denis McDonough on Thursday, the first in a series of Hill meetings.

Meanwhile, the groups that will be responsible for on-the-ground work say they’re waiting.

Obama is leaning heavily on outside allies, and on Friday he asked Planned Parenthood to help sell the law with a pitch heavy on benefits to women, like contraceptive coverage and preventive care — the same targeted themes he stressed during his reelection campaign.

But Enroll America, the coalition of health care advocates, industry groups, and labor and civil rights organizations that’s planning a massive outreach effort, says it’s still planning to kick into full gear its “Get Covered America” campaign this summer — it’s not speeding up the timetable. Headed by Anne Filipic, the former deputy director of the White House Office of Public Engagement, the coalition is planning a campaign of online organizing, grass-roots outreach and paid advertising.

Organizing for Action has been planning its own outreach campaign for the summer, too, which is shaping up as a big test of the strength of its armies of volunteers. OFA officials didn’t respond to questions about whether they’ll speed up their plans.

Why wait? The answer, the law’s supporters say, is that if they do the outreach too early — and people are told they can sign up for Obamacare coverage with generous subsidies but there’s nowhere to go right now — they’ll just tune out.

But Democrats are worried now — about the messaging and the mechanics of the rollout.

“I’m concerned — because we did take substantial criticism for putting this plan in place — that it achieve its true purpose,” said Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas. “There’s so much work to do in such a short period of time.”

Other Democrats say the public is still confused about the law and they want to see more outreach and public education. Sen.

But here's another key point here: Both Democrat ""yea"" votes came from House veterans who represent red districts. That means that every other vulnerable Democrat, and every single Democratic freshman, voted to protect every last detail of Obamacare, including IRS enforcement. How's that going to play? (Have fun, NRCC). House Republicans couldn't have timed this symbolic vote any better. Hell, the GOP campaign committees should send flowers to the entire IRS management team. I'm speechless.



UPDATE - By the way, ABC News also confirmed that the ""fired"" IRS acting commissioner was on his way out anyway. The second head to roll, Joseph Grant, was just promoted eight days ago to the position that he's now vacating. Eight days ago, he was elevated to replace...you guessed it, Sarah Hall Ingram.

( July 12 ) AP
WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans Thursday released a revised version of their plan to replace Obamacare — dumping some tax cuts for the wealthy , allowing for more insurance policies with limited coverage and increasing funding to fight the opioid addiction epidemic .
But it 's unclear whether the changes are enough to win over moderates concerned that the bill ’ s cuts to Medicaid and private insurance subsidies will leave millions without care , or whether conservatives are satisfied the bill would repeal enough of the Affordable Care Act 's taxes and regulations .
Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , had to scrap a planned Senate vote at the end of June because he could not round up the 50 Republican votes he needs to advance the legislation . Thursday he said the Senate will vote on the bill next week , even though there are still wavering Republican senators who have not committed to vote for it .
Here ’ s a look at what is in the revised bill , and how it could affect you .
The revised version keeps the taxes imposed by the ACA on investment income , on high earners . And it no longer eliminates the ACA ’ s limit on how much of the executive ’ s pay an insurance company can write off as a corporate tax deduction . The bill would still repeal other ACA taxes , including those on tanning beds , sectors of the health care industry and on high-cost employer-provided insurance plans .
Would you still receive a subsidy to reduce the cost of premiums ?
You could still lose all or some of your subsidy , which is now available to people earning up to $ 84,650 for a family of three . That income limit would still be lowered slightly and would become less generous . But people who have tax-advantaged Health Savings Accounts can use their HSA contributions to pay for premiums , instead of just for health services and products as they can now .
The bill would let anyone buy catastrophic plans , including those who qualify for subsidies . Those plans have low premiums , but high deductibles and limited benefits .

If an insurer offers plans that meet the ACA ’ s requirements — including covering minimum benefits and not charging sicker people more — theinsurer could receive funding to help cover the cost of sick customers . But it ’ s unclear whether the funding would be enough to keep the plans affordable . Because insurers would also be able to sell plans that don ’ t meet the ACA ’ s requirements , that would segment the market into sick and healthy people . Insurance companies say that would destabilize the market and increase costs for people with pre-existing conditions .
But would insurers have to cover you if you have a pre-existing condition ?
The plans that don ’ t meet the ACA ’ s requirements would not have to accept sick people , according to Larry Levitt , senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation . And the bill would make it easier for states to waive requirements that insurance plans cover specific benefits , which could make it difficult for those with expensive health conditions to find affordable plans . Like the earlier version , the new bill would also still end the ACA 's requirement that insurers spend a specific amount of the premiums they collect on benefits , instead of on profits , administration and other expenses
Would you still get help paying for deductibles and co-payments ?
The bill would still sunset in two years cost-sharing subsidies for low- and middle-income people who purchase insurance on an exchange . But it now includes an additional $ 70 billion – up from $ 112 billion – for states to reduce insurance costs in other ways . States would have to match the funds .
The bill would still eliminate the ACA 's requirement that insurers ca n't charge older customers more than three times what younger customers pay for the same coverage . Instead , those in their 60s could be charged five times as much , or more .
Would young adults be able to stay on their parents ’ plan ?
The bill would not change the ACA ’ s rule that dependent children can stay on a parent 's plan until age 26 .
If you are among the more than 14 million Americans who gained eligibility through the ACA , you could still lose it . Enhanced federal funding for the low-income adults who became newly qualified would be phased out , ending after 2024 .
Federal support for traditional Medicaid would also still be scaled back . States , which pay a portion of the cost of Medicaid , would have to find new funding or cut the program through restricting enrollment , curbing benefits , reducing payments to health care providers or finding efficiencies .
The revised bill does include changes to the way hospitals are paid by the federal government to help cover the bills of the uninsured , which are expected to increase . And if a state has a health emergency , the extra spending needed would not count toward the state ’ s new limit on federal Medicaid dollars .
The bill still effectively removes the ACA ’ s requirement that most people buy insurance by eliminating the tax penalties for failing to do so . But those who have a gap in their insurance coverage would have to wait six months before they can re-enroll .
The bill would still end the ACA ’ s penalties for larger employers who do n't offer insurance to workers . The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said fewer employers will offer coverage if that change is made .

Thursday he said the Senate will vote on the bill next week, even though there are still wavering Republican senators who have not committed to vote for it.

You could still lose all or some of your subsidy, which is now available to people earning up to $84,650 for a family of three. That income limit would still be lowered slightly and would become less generous. But people who have tax-advantaged Health Savings Accounts can use their HSA contributions to pay for premiums, instead of just for health services and products as they can now.

Could you buy bare-bones insurance plans with the subsidy?

The bill would let anyone buy catastrophic plans, including those who qualify for subsidies. Those plans have low premiums, but high deductibles and limited benefits.

What if you need a lot of health care services?

If an insurer offers plans that meet the ACA’s requirements — including covering minimum benefits and not charging sicker people more — theinsurer could receive funding to help cover the cost of sick customers. But it’s unclear whether the funding would be enough to keep the plans affordable. Because insurers would also be able to sell plans that don’t meet the ACA’s requirements, that would segment the market into sick and healthy people.

Could older people be charged more?

The bill would still eliminate the ACA's requirement that insurers can't charge older customers more than three times what younger customers pay for the same coverage. Instead, those in their 60s could be charged five times as much, or more.

Would young adults be able to stay on their parents’ plan?

The bill would not change the ACA’s rule that dependent children can stay on a parent's plan until age 26.

What happens to people on Medicaid?

If you are among the more than 14 million Americans who gained eligibility through the ACA, you could still lose it. Enhanced federal funding for the low-income adults who became newly qualified would be phased out, ending after 2024.

Federal support for traditional Medicaid would also still be scaled back. States, which pay a portion of the cost of Medicaid, would have to find new funding or cut the program through restricting enrollment, curbing benefits, reducing payments to health care providers or finding efficiencies.

Would you still be required to buy health insurance?

The bill still effectively removes the ACA’s requirement that most people buy insurance by eliminating the tax penalties for failing to do so. But those who have a gap in their insurance coverage would have to wait six months before they can re-enroll.

What if you receive insurance through an employer?

The bill would still end the ACA’s penalties for larger employers who don't offer insurance to workers. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said fewer employers will offer coverage if that change is made.

What if you or a family member are struggling with addiction?

The revised bill increases funding to states for addiction services, including $45 billion instead of the $2 billion in the initial version. That’s how much GOP Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia were seeking to help fight the opioid epidemic in their hard-hit states. But it could still fall short of what’s needed.

What would happen to coverage for abortion services?

As in the original version, insurance plans sold through the exchanges could not cover abortion services. There’s an exception for abortions performed to save the life of the mother, or to end a pregnancy that resulted from rape or incest.

What about services offered by Planned Parenthood?

The bill would also continue to block Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid funding for a year. The federal government already prevents Medicaid patients from receiving abortion services. But the bill would also block them from using Planned Parenthood for contraception, testing for and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, and other services. GOP Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska oppose this provision.

Earlier this week, in an effort led by Sen. Ted Cruz, some of my Republican colleagues and I took to the Senate floor with the intent of making Washington listen. The American people have made it abundantly clear that they do not want Obamacare. In fact, a majority of elected officials, the same officials that voted to implement this health care mandate, do not want it, either.

Last summer, in a 5-4 decision authored by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., the Supreme Court wrongly concluded that Obamacare’s individual mandate could stand. As a consequence of the court’s ruling, starting on Oct. 1, whether they want it or not, Americans will be compelled to purchase a government-mandated product — health insurance — or pay a tax.

What should infuriate you the most is the fact that the same elected officials who implemented this mandate have recently declared themselves exempt from it. That is to say, these officials are forcing you to partake in something that they themselves are refusing. If Obamacare is so great, why then are federal employees and elected officials getting special treatment and opting out?

If President Obama, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, Sen. Harry Reid and Chief Justice Roberts love Obamacare so much, they should live under it. Their actions speak louder than words, and it is erroneous for these leaders to even attempt to claim that Obamacare is a step forward for Americans.

The American people do not approve of the Obamacare mandate and flocked to town halls across the country to let their representatives know it. In fact, only 12 percent of Americans think Obamacare will have a positive impact on their lives, according to a recent NBC-Wall Street Journal poll.

Headlines across the nation shows the harm Obamacare is imposing on Americans: “Georgia Healthcare Company Cuts 101 Employees due to Obamacare,” “Michigan School District Cuts Hours for Employees Because of Obamacare,” “Cleveland Clinic Announces Job Cuts to Prepare for Obamacare” and “Small Businesses Consider Dropping Healthcare Plans Under Obamacare,” just to name a few.

Before the Obamacare health insurance exchanges open on Oct. 1, we are already witnessing the negative effects this mandate is having on those it intended to help. We cannot even begin to fathom all of the negative effects Obamacare holds.

Based on separate analyses from Congressional Budget Office and Deloitte, between 20 million and 65 million Americans could lose their employer-sponsored health insurance policies, and according to the CBO, the health care reform law will destroy 800,000 jobs.

An analysis from the Joint Committee on Taxation and the CBO from September 2012 shows that in 2016, half of the tax imposed by the individual mandate will fall on those making an annual income of less than $120,000 for a family of four, or $59,000 for an individual. Families of four making $72,000 or less (and individuals making $35,400 or less) will bear 35 percent of the mandate tax. This is a direct tax on the middle class.

Through its proposed $1 trillion in tax increases, the $716 billion in Medicare cuts, and the individual mandates and regulations, it is clear that Obamacare will swiftly harm our country.

I find it absolutely despicable that Mr. Obama, his administration and the elected officials who shoved this mandate down the throat of Americans are now giving themselves waivers. The president is also giving his friends waivers. Mr. Obama’s behavior mirrors that of a captain jumping overboard, abandoning his own sinking ship.

I have a proposal. I have offered an amendment that would outlaw any special exemptions for government employees. This amendment requires all federal workers to purchase health insurance from the new Obamacare exchanges, instead of receiving taxpayer-funded subsidies.

I am also introducing a more broad constitutional amendment, which states that Congress shall make no law that treats citizens differently from the elites in the federal government.

Political leaders such as Mr. Obama and Mrs. Pelosi need to realize that they are not above the American people, and they are not above our laws, period. If Chief Justice Roberts thinks it is OK for the federal government to tax individuals if they don’t buy expensive private health insurance plans, he should be forced into Obamacare’s government-centered health care system. Members of Congress should also be forced to suffer under the same flawed health care system that Washington wants to use as a social experiment on the American people.

My legislation and constitutional amendment will remind all elected officials that they are not above the law, and they are certainly not above the American people.

A new report from the Kaiser Family Foundation finds that in seven major cities that have released data on 2015 premiums, the price of the benchmark Obamacare plan — the second-cheapest silver plan, which the federal government uses to calculate subsidies — is falling.

Yes, falling.

""Falling"" is not a word that people associate with health-insurance premiums. They tend to rise as regularly as the morning sun.

""I expected premium growth to be modest in most of the country,"" Larry Levitt, a co-author of the report, told Vox's Sarah Kliff. ""But what we saw were some decreases instead.""

Obamacare's surprising successes

Obamacare is doing better at a lot of things than anyone seriously expected. The law's initial premiums came in cheaper than the Congressional Budget Office projected when the law first passed. In April 2014, the Congressional Budget Office said the unexpectedly low premiums meant Obamacare would cost $104 billion less than they previously thought. If Kaiser's estimates hold nationally, Obamacare's cost will have to be revised downward yet again.

The fear about government programs in general, and government health-insurance programs in particular, is that they are overly generous because they spend other people's money. But Obamacare's competitive insurance marketplaces are actually doing what they promised to do: forcing insurers to compete for customers by cutting costs. The Congressional Budget Office explains that Obamacare's premiums are cheaper-than-expected because its insurance features ""lower payment rates for providers, narrower networks of providers, and tighter management of their subscribers' use of health care than employment-based plans do.""

That is something of an extraordinary statement: Obamacare is forcing insurers to run leaner than employers are. The CBO is so surprised by this that it basically refuses to believe it will last. They expect that Obamacare ""will not be able to sustain provider payment rates that are as low or networks that are as narrow as they appear to be in 2014,"" though they think it will continue to run leaner than employer-based insurance.

The 2010 time machine

Imagine taking a time machine back to 2010 and telling Republicans in Congress, who were arguing that the CBO was wildly underestimating Obamacare's cost, that the law would be cheaper than predicted and, at least in the states that accepted its Medicaid dollars, cover more people than the Congressional Budget Office thought. After the laughing and mocking and the calling of security, let's say you offered this prediction in the form a of a bet. What odds do you think Obamacare's critics would have offered? 2:1? 5:1? 10:1?

Or imagine it played out the other way. Imagine that Obamacare's 2014 premiums had come in higher than expected, and its 2015 premiums were growing even faster than projected.

Maybe so, polling results show. ",2014-05-05,Mark Trumbull,"The American public is now evenly split in its opinion of the Affordable Care Act , an improvement in the law 's standing , according to a new ███/TIPP poll .
Some 47 percent of American adults support the law known as Obamacare , and 47 percent are opposed , finds the poll , conducted between April 26 and May 1 .
This result is just one indicator – and a tentative one – that when the Obamacare marketplaces outperformed expectations by exceeding 7 million people enrolled , the news may have given Obamacare a boost in public opinion . So far , other recent polls still find that more people disapprove of the law than approve , and that public opinion is little changed since the April 1 enrollment deadline .
When the Monitor/TIPP poll asked in a late March survey whether people support or oppose the health-care law passed in 2010 , more than half were opposed ( 51 percent ) and 40 percent said they support the law .
So the even split between the “ support ” and “ oppose ” camps , in the new poll , looks like a considerable change since March .
“ They are in a statistical dead heat , ” says pollster Raghavan Mayur , president of TechnoMetrica Market Intelligence , by e-mail .

Some 47 percent of American adults support the law known as Obamacare, and 47 percent are opposed, finds the poll, conducted between April 26 and May 1.

This result is just one indicator – and a tentative one – that when the Obamacare marketplaces outperformed expectations by exceeding 7 million people enrolled, the news may have given Obamacare a boost in public opinion. So far, other recent polls still find that more people disapprove of the law than approve, and that public opinion is little changed since the April 1 enrollment deadline.

When the Monitor/TIPP poll asked in a late March survey whether people support or oppose the health-care law passed in 2010, more than half were opposed (51 percent) and 40 percent said they support the law.

So the even split between the “support” and “oppose” camps, in the new poll, looks like a considerable change since March.

“They are in a statistical dead heat,” says pollster Raghavan Mayur, president of TechnoMetrica Market Intelligence, by e-mail.

The margin of error, an estimate of how much the poll results may differ from actual public opinion, is 3.4 percentage points, similar to other national polling on the subject. Although the margin of error makes poll results a bit fuzzy, Mr. Mayur says support for the law “has increased” since late March.

With other polls not seeing that trend, what remains to be seen is whether the Monitor/TIPP result is a temporary outlier or an early sign that views toward the law are becoming a bit more positive.

Public opinion about the law is important because health-care policy promises to remain an issue of heated political debate. Republicans are hoping to leverage opposition to the law in their favor in congressional elections, while Democrats are hoping their support of the law won’t be too much of a liability.

This year marks the law’s major rollout phase, with “exchanges,” or marketplaces, including the federal HealthCare.gov website launching for individuals to shop for coverage that complies with the law.

Even an improved public view of the law isn’t a rosy one.

In the Monitor/TIPP poll, fully 44 percent of respondents say Congress should repeal the law. One of the act’s less-popular provisions is the “individual mandate,” which calls on people to buy insurance this year (if they don’t have it already) or face a possible tax penalty.

The high cost of health care remains a public concern (as it was before the law), and many Americans worry about having limited access to particular doctors and care providers under the health plans available on the Obamacare exchanges.

Other elements of the law are popular, such as a provision to ensure that people can obtain insurance regardless of preexisting medical conditions.

When the White House reported that the number of people applying for insurance on the exchanges surged to 8 million as of early April, President Obama sought to use the news to galvanize public support.

“Independent experts now estimate that millions of Americans who were uninsured have gained coverage this year – with millions more to come next year and the year after,” Mr. Obama said on April 17. “This thing is working.”

Pollsters, in framing their survey questions about the ACA, characterize it as a ""health reform law"" or a ""law making changes to the health-care system."" (The Monitor/TIPP poll calls it the ""health care law passed in 2010, also known as Obamacare."") For comparison, here is the mix of late-April poll results regarding Obamacare (as tracked by the website PollingReport.com), presented in chronological order from the most recent poll to one that concluded on April 21.

“I believe [the feds] can go to the states and negotiate” to convert their Medicaid dollars into unrestricted lump payments “for states that want to do this,” Jindal said Friday in a call with reporters.

There’s a long road to get from Thursday’s ruling to serious negotiations, of course.

Several governors immediately responded to the ruling by hinting they won’t expand their Medicaid program — though most have been careful to leave themselves an out in case they decide it’s to their advantage.

“I would resist any expansion of Medicaid that could result in significant tax increases or dramatic cuts to education, public safety and job creation,” Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant said in a statement.

Of course, there’s a lot of political pressure on Republicans to take advantage of a court-sanctioned escape from a major health reform provision.

Republicans on Capitol Hill are sending signals to their governors that they should use it if they know what’s good for them.

“The more states that would do that, I think the better,” said Florida Rep. Tom Rooney. “Anything that a state can do to try to water [health reform] down, the better.”

But if Republicans don’t sweep Washington in the fall and manage to repeal the health care law, governors could have very different pressures weighing on them when budget time comes around.

That’s why many experts believe that states could still come to the table. And digging in their heels now may actually strengthen their bargaining position when negotiations begin.

Flynn, Elad Vaida, J.T. Young, Scott Mckay, Roger Stark","When Hillary Clinton held a seemingly insurmountable lead in most national and state polls , she didn ’ t need to worry about the health insurance sticker shock that much of the electorate is about to experience . Her edge was large enough to ensure victory even if she lost a couple of points due to voter anger over skyrocketing premiums caused by Obamacare . Those halcyon days are gone . Her national lead has all but evaporated , and she is behind Donald Trump or clinging to tenuous leads in crucial swing states whose voters will learn of huge rate hikes one week before Election Day .
To secure a majority in the Electoral College , Clinton must prevent Trump from winning several swing states that Obama carried in 2012 . If Trump hangs on to all the states Romney won and beats Hillary in a few of these battleground states , he will be the next President . And Obamacare may well help him accomplish this feat . Trump has pledged to repeal the unpopular “ reform ” law while Clinton still defends it . This distinction will become particularly poignant to swing state voters whose double-digit premium hikes hit just as they are deciding for whom to cast their November ballots .
In Ohio , for example , Obama easily won in 2012 but Trump has led Clinton in 4 of the last 5 surveys of likely voters listed by RealClearPolitics . It ’ s probably not a coincidence that Ohio is one of the battleground states in which Obamacare has driven up out-of-pocket health care expenses . The Columbus Dispatch reports , “ Ohioans insured through the Affordable Care Act will have fewer providers to choose from next year and will pay more for coverage. ” Buckeye State voters aren ’ t likely to switch to Clinton while she continues defend the law that is causing this catastrophe .
The same dynamic is at work in Florida , another crucial swing state that Obama narrowly won in 2012 . This year , as Election Day draws nigh , Floridians will discover what “ affordable ” means when Clinton uses the term . As the Miami Herald puts it , “ Floridians who buy their own health insurance in 2017 are likely to see their premiums rise by an average of 19 percent over the current year. ” As in Ohio , Trump has already erased Clinton ’ s Florida lead , and these Obamacare-induced rate hikes aren ’ t likely to send Sunshine State voters running back into her arms in November .
In addition to pulling ahead of Clinton in Ohio and Florida , Trump appears likely to pick off yet another state easily won by President Obama in 2008 and 2012 . He beat both John McCain and Mitt Romney by comfortable margins in Iowa , but Hillary is having difficulties there . At present , Trump leads her by 4.3 percent in the RealClearPolitics average , and it ’ s probable that Obamacare-induced premium increases in that state are a contributing factor . The Des Moines Register reports that individual premiums in Iowa will increase “ 19 percent to 43 percent , depending on the carrier . ”
Another swing state Obama easily won in 2012 , where Trump has overtaken Clinton in the polls is Nevada . And what is the premium picture in the Silver State ? The Las Vegas Review-Journal reports , “ Average overall premiums for 2017 in Nevada are expected to increase between 7.95 and 16.99 percent. ” By now , it won ’ t be hard to guess what the polls are showing . The most recent surveys of likely voters show Trump ahead of Clinton . The RealClearPolitics average still shows her with a lead of less than half a percent , and that will likely be long gone by Election Day .
Yet another state that Obamacare may help Trump win is Colorado . The Centennial state , according to Money , is one of several whose premiums will increase by about 25 percent . And the latest poll of likely voters shows Trump beating Clinton by 4 percent . And , if you think of Colorado as a blue state , remember that its electoral votes went to the GOP candidate in 7 of the last 10 presidential elections , including the last time a Clinton was on the ticket . It ’ s unlikely that Colorado ’ s voters will be anxious to vote for another Clinton who supports the law that caused its huge premium hike .
So , where does all this put Trump when you add up the Electoral College votes ? If he wins all of the states Romney won , that gets him to 206 . By adding Ohio ( 18 ) , Florida ( 29 ) , Iowa ( 6 ) , Nevada ( 6 ) , and Colorado ( 9 ) , that puts him at 274—and he wins . Moreover , this is not Trump ’ s only route to the White House . He can give up Iowa , Nevada , and Colorado if he wins Pennsylvania , a state that will be hit hard by Obamacare-induced premium increases and where his campaign is spending a lot of resources . Pennsylvania will get Trump to 273 electoral votes if he wins the Romney states .
It is not a given , of course , that Trump will carry all of the Romney states , which brings us to North Carolina . Romney won that state in 2012 and Clinton holds a less than 1 percent lead there . But how is Obamacare working out in the Tar Heel State ? Its exchange offers consumers one choice , Blue Cross & Blue Shield ( BCBS ) , since Aetna pulled out . It isn ’ t difficult to predict the effect this monopoly will have on rates . As local news station WLOS reports , “ BCBS is telling its agents exchange rates are going up… nearly 20 percent in 2017 after increasing 32 percent this year . ”
This doesn ’ t guarantee that Carolina will go to Trump , or that he will hold all of the Romney states , but it will hardly endear Clinton to the voters . Last week Gallup released a new survey showing that that the number of people who have been hurt by Obamacare has reached an all time high . This law is a debilitating disease that continues to afflict her presidential bid . By itself , it probably wouldn ’ t be enough to kill her campaign , but combined with the other scandals that continue to undermine its immune system , Obamacare might be the infection that finally proves fatal to Clinton ’ s presidential ambitions .","When Hillary Clinton held a seemingly insurmountable lead in most national and state polls, she didn’t need to worry about the health insurance sticker shock that much of the electorate is about to experience.

healthcare,The Denver Post,1,http://www.denverpost.com/2017/06/23/we-need-a-bi-partisan-solution-to-fix-obamacare/,OPINION: We need a bipartisan solution to fix Obamacare,2017-06-23,,"Count us as pleased that U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner is calling for the Senate to slow down its push for a replacement health-care act , even offering to work through the upcoming recess . But much more work is needed .
The two proposals on the table can ’ t be characterized as anything other than , as former President Barack Obama eloquently put it : “ a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America . ”
But Obama ’ s criticism of the Republican bill goes too far in its absolute condemnation . Change is justified by the current cost of Medicaid and private insurance .
The problem is Republicans will likely be heading the wrong direction if they try to pick up hard-line repeal advocates Sens . Ted Cruz , Rand Paul , Mike Lee and Ron Johnson who are threatening bill-blocking “ no ” votes unless there ’ s a more dramatic move to free-market principles .
If only there were four moderate Democrats willing to offer their services to Republicans in this moment of GOP fracture . Smart , middle-of-the road businessmen like Sen. Michael Bennet . And if only Congress weren ’ t so divided that Majority Leader Mitch McConnell could accept such an offer to move the debate to the center .
Doing so would require Senate Democrats to admit that the current level of coverage under Medicaid is unsustainable . It would require Republicans to admit that because health insurance is so expensive in this country , Medicaid must cover more people than it once did .
Lawmakers would have to maintain the unpopular taxes on the medical industry and the massive 3.8 percent tax on investment income . Senate Republicans already planned to keep the Cadillac tax on high-cost insurance plans , but they shouldn ’ t delay it for almost another decade .
Those tax increases were supposed to fund the Affordable Care Act . Now that money could be used to either maintain a higher level of funding for Medicaid than is proposed by the House and Senate plans or to increase tax credits and subsidies to the poor who would be kicked off Medicaid under the current Republican plans .
More people in the private insurance network — even if they are impoverished — will in theory help drive down prices . That could give the failing private insurance market a needed boost and could prevent them from balking about having to continue to insure people with pre-existing conditions even as the individual mandate goes away .
We ’ ve maintained that reforming this nation ’ s Medicaid system — beyond Obama ’ s expansion — is an issue that should be taken up on its own , rather than tacked onto an Obamacare repeal effort .

Cory Gardner is calling for the Senate to slow down its push for a replacement health-care act, even offering to work through the upcoming recess. But much more work is needed.

The two proposals on the table can’t be characterized as anything other than, as former President Barack Obama eloquently put it: “a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America.”

But Obama’s criticism of the Republican bill goes too far in its absolute condemnation. Change is justified by the current cost of Medicaid and private insurance.

So what should Republicans come up with?

The problem is Republicans will likely be heading the wrong direction if they try to pick up hard-line repeal advocates Sens. Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Mike Lee and Ron Johnson who are threatening bill-blocking “no” votes unless there’s a more dramatic move to free-market principles.

If only there were four moderate Democrats willing to offer their services to Republicans in this moment of GOP fracture. Smart, middle-of-the road businessmen like Sen. Michael Bennet. And if only Congress weren’t so divided that Majority Leader Mitch McConnell could accept such an offer to move the debate to the center.

Doing so would require Senate Democrats to admit that the current level of coverage under Medicaid is unsustainable. It would require Republicans to admit that because health insurance is so expensive in this country, Medicaid must cover more people than it once did.

What would that middle ground look like?

Lawmakers would have to maintain the unpopular taxes on the medical industry and the massive 3.8 percent tax on investment income. Senate Republicans already planned to keep the Cadillac tax on high-cost insurance plans, but they shouldn’t delay it for almost another decade.

Those tax increases were supposed to fund the Affordable Care Act. Now that money could be used to either maintain a higher level of funding for Medicaid than is proposed by the House and Senate plans or to increase tax credits and subsidies to the poor who would be kicked off Medicaid under the current Republican plans.

More people in the private insurance network — even if they are impoverished — will in theory help drive down prices. That could give the failing private insurance market a needed boost and could prevent them from balking about having to continue to insure people with pre-existing conditions even as the individual mandate goes away.

We’ve maintained that reforming this nation’s Medicaid system — beyond Obama’s expansion — is an issue that should be taken up on its own, rather than tacked onto an Obamacare repeal effort. But if this effort continues, any bill reforming Medicaid payments (absent the expansion population) should be a data-driven analysis of funding levels needed to protect the most at-risk patients. Kids make up more than half of the original Medicaid population. We would hope there would be bipartisan support to hold funding for kids harmless from cuts. The Senate version of repeal and replace includes a provision championed by Gardner for disabled children and those with medically complex conditions to be exempt from spending limits placed on states.

More should be done to ensure that as we reform the flawed Medicaid payment system (one that rewards spending rather than good care and efficiency) it doesn’t create health-care instability for our most vulnerable populations.

Finally, it’s worth saying again, all these years after even Democrats failed to make the leap, that the federal government should launch a public option insurance plan that can compete alongside private insurers.

Think the canceled health policies hurt the Obamacare cause? There’s another political time bomb lurking that could explode not too long before next year’s elections: rate hikes for small businesses.

Like the canceled individual health plans, it’s another example of a trade-off that health care experts have long known about, as the new rules for health insurance prices create winners and losers. But most Americans won’t become aware of it until some small-business employees learn that their premiums are going up because of a law called — oops — the Affordable Care Act.

Story Continued Below

Some will learn the opposite, that their premiums are going down because of the law. But as we saw with the canceled individual health plans, it’s the losers who will get most of the attention.

And the timing will be terrible for Democrats: A lot of those small businesses will have to start dealing with their new premiums in October — just in time for Republicans to make it an issue in their midterm election campaigns.

( PHOTOS: 12 Democrats criticizing the Obamacare rollout)

There are no widely accepted estimates for how many people could be affected, but even if it’s a relative minority, it won’t matter politically — because Democrats will once again have to defend the administration’s claims that the majority of Americans who have employer-based insurance won’t be affected by Obamacare.

“The biggest shocker for the small-business community is going to hit in October, which is interesting because it will be prime time for the election,” said Jessica Waltman, a top lobbyist at the National Association of Health Underwriters.

Here’s why: Next year, small-business health plans — those that cover 50 or fewer workers — will have to comply with a wide range of new rules, particularly the ones that say the businesses can’t be charged more if their workers have health problems. Their premiums will vary based only on the workers’ ages, whether they have individual or family coverage, what part of the country they live in, and whether they use tobacco — and older workers won’t be able to be charged more than three times as much as younger ones.

The new small-business plans will also have to cover the same set of minimum benefits that individual health plans will have to provide, including pediatric care and mental health and substance abuse services.

That could be a big political problem for the Obama administration, which has taken pains to present the law as a badly needed source of relief for small businesses. It sets up health insurance marketplaces for small businesses, called SHOP exchanges, around the country to provide them with more choices and better bargaining clout, and it provides tax credits for the smallest firms.

The issue is too far down the road to get a lot of attention from the administration now, since it has plenty of more immediate concerns, especially with the start of Obamacare coverage Jan. 1 and the need to make sure no one has a gap in coverage.

John McCain ’ s cancer diagnosis and budget estimates that said 22 million fewer people would hold insurance under their revised replacement plan .
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , Kentucky Republican , wants to take up the House-passed health care bill Tuesday , setting the stage for amendments and final passage before Congress leaves for its August recess .
Mr. McCain ’ s absence is pivotal because leaders will not be able to proceed if more than one Republican defects . Without the Arizona Republican , the party ’ s majority is reduced in the Senate from 52 to 51 .
“ The fight to move beyond the status quo of Obamacare was certainly never going to be easy , but we ’ ve come a long way , ” Mr. McConnell said . “ I look forward to continuing our work together to finally bring relief . ”
Yet Senate Republicans haven ’ t settled on a path forward . Some want to forge ahead with a replacement bill while others want to revive a 2015 “ repeal then replace ” plan that President Obama vetoed but President Trump would sign now , even if the two-step strategy would sow uncertainty in the insurance markets .
Both proposals appeared to lack sufficient support , though leaders are tweaking the replacement plan in an effort to bring more Senate Republicans on board after the push fell apart earlier in the week .
Still others want to let the states decide what to do with their Obamacare money or start over with an open committee process that involves Democrats .
Some Republican holdouts want to know which option will lead the pack before voting to proceed , but Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas told reporters that is a “ luxury we don ’ t have. ” Leaders say it ’ s important to get onto the bill and debate it openly during the marathon session of amendments that accompany the budget process Republicans are using to carve out Democrats .
“ Their ultimate protection is to withhold their vote on the final product , ” Mr. Cornyn , Texas Republican , said of skittish Republicans . “ Rather than do that on the front end , my hope is they decide to proceed to debate the bill , amend it and then we can continue to work toward a 50-senator consensus on what the final vote will be . ”
Mr. Trump would still like to replace Obamacare , yet the Congressional Budget Office on Thursday said the latest Republican plan would increase the number of uninsured Americans by 15 million in 2018 compared with Obamacare . The figure rises to 22 million by 2026 . That eye-popping figure hasn ’ t changed since June , when the CBO said a previous version of the bill would result in the same number losing coverage , spooking moderate Republicans .
“ The latest CBO report makes clear ( once again ) : No amount of tweaks , modifications or giveaways Senate Republicans make or add to their health care bill can change the fact that the bill is rotten at its core and would leave millions of Americans worse off , ” said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer , New York Democrat .
A poll from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research says 62 percent of people think it is the federal government ’ s responsibility to ensure that all Americans have health care coverage , while 37 percent say it ’ s not .
Sen. Rand Paul , Kentucky Republican and pivotal holdout , said the replacement plan maintains too big of a federal role . He said if leaders promise to put a “ clean repeal ” vote on equal footing with other ideas , he would likely vote to proceed onto the bill and amendment process .
“ I think the major proposals could be put at the very front . We debate them on the first day , ” Mr. Paul said .
He said Senate leaders could draw lots to set the order of votes on the 2015 repeal , the replacement plan and other leading ideas , such as a bill by Sens . Susan M. Collins of Maine and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana that would let states decide whether to keep Obamacare or opt into a more conservative model .
The chaotic push toward a resolution follows a topsy-turvy week . Four Senate Republicans opposed proceeding with a replacement bill late Monday , and a trio objected Tuesday to taking up Mr. McConnell ’ s Plan B — the straight repeal measure from 2015 . On Wednesday , Mr. Trump urged Senate Republicans to revive their replacement bill during a face-to-face lecture at the White House .
The revised replacement plan includes $ 70 billion more to help fund state health care reforms and another $ 45 billion to aid the opioid crisis , yet would save $ 420 billion over the coming decade .
CBO analysts said premiums would rise at first under the bill as written , mainly because the mandate requiring healthy people to join the market would be scrapped , though rates would be 25 percent lower than under Obamacare for popular “ benchmark ” plans by 2026 — in part because policies would be skimpier .
The CBO score released Thursday did not include an amendment that Sen. Ted Cruz , Texas Republican , proposed to let insurers sell plans that don ’ t comply with Obamacare ’ s coverage regulations , so healthier consumers could pay much less for skinnier coverage . The Health and Human Services Department released a report Wednesday that said the amendment would have positive effects , though relying on that report instead of a CBO score would be an unusual break from tradition .
Meanwhile , some moderate Republicans are still worried about deep cuts to the Medicaid program , saying they will burden their states ’ budgets or leave constituents out in the cold .
Republicans are holding private meetings in efforts to make progress .
One new idea involves using funds from two Obamacare taxes on high earners to bolster states that expanded Medicaid insurance for the poor under Mr. Obama . The Republican plan would gradually phase out federal funding for the expansion through the middle of the next decade , unnerving some moderates .
An influx of funding could mollify some of them , but conservatives say they should be focused on policy changes instead .

Ron Johnson , Wisconsin Republican . “ That ’ s not what I want to see . ”","Senate Republican leaders plowed ahead with plans to put Obamacare in the rearview mirror by August but faced even longer odds Thursday, reeling from Sen.

“The latest CBO report makes clear (once again): No amount of tweaks, modifications or giveaways Senate Republicans make or add to their health care bill can change the fact that the bill is rotten at its core and would leave millions of Americans worse off,” said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat.

A poll from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research says 62 percent of people think it is the federal government’s responsibility to ensure that all Americans have health care coverage, while 37 percent say it’s not.

Sen. Rand Paul, Kentucky Republican and pivotal holdout, said the replacement plan maintains too big of a federal role. He said if leaders promise to put a “clean repeal” vote on equal footing with other ideas, he would likely vote to proceed onto the bill and amendment process.

“I think the major proposals could be put at the very front. We debate them on the first day,” Mr. Paul said.

He said Senate leaders could draw lots to set the order of votes on the 2015 repeal, the replacement plan and other leading ideas, such as a bill by Sens. Susan M. Collins of Maine and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana that would let states decide whether to keep Obamacare or opt into a more conservative model.

The chaotic push toward a resolution follows a topsy-turvy week. Four Senate Republicans opposed proceeding with a replacement bill late Monday, and a trio objected Tuesday to taking up Mr. McConnell’s Plan B — the straight repeal measure from 2015. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump urged Senate Republicans to revive their replacement bill during a face-to-face lecture at the White House.

The revised replacement plan includes $70 billion more to help fund state health care reforms and another $45 billion to aid the opioid crisis, yet would save $420 billion over the coming decade.

CBO analysts said premiums would rise at first under the bill as written, mainly because the mandate requiring healthy people to join the market would be scrapped, though rates would be 25 percent lower than under Obamacare for popular “benchmark” plans by 2026 — in part because policies would be skimpier.

The CBO score released Thursday did not include an amendment that Sen. Ted Cruz, Texas Republican, proposed to let insurers sell plans that don’t comply with Obamacare’s coverage regulations, so healthier consumers could pay much less for skinnier coverage. The Health and Human Services Department released a report Wednesday that said the amendment would have positive effects, though relying on that report instead of a CBO score would be an unusual break from tradition.

Meanwhile, some moderate Republicans are still worried about deep cuts to the Medicaid program, saying they will burden their states’ budgets or leave constituents out in the cold.

Republicans are holding private meetings in efforts to make progress.

One new idea involves using funds from two Obamacare taxes on high earners to bolster states that expanded Medicaid insurance for the poor under Mr. Obama. The Republican plan would gradually phase out federal funding for the expansion through the middle of the next decade, unnerving some moderates.

An influx of funding could mollify some of them, but conservatives say they should be focused on policy changes instead.

“I’m concerned we’re throwing money at the problem,” said Sen. Ron Johnson, Wisconsin Republican. “That’s not what I want to see.”

Wade decision marked its 47th anniversary , Texas got news from the federal government that it would be allowed to receive millions in Medicaid funding to support a family planning program that discriminates among providers — the same strategy that in recent years likely caused a rise in unintended pregnancies .
“ The Lone Star State is once again in partnership with the federal government to provide meaningful family planning and health services while fostering a culture of life , ” Gov . Greg Abbott said of the deal , which will make $ 350 million available to the state over the next five years . “ This collaboration is a symbol of our commitment to championing the lives of Texas women . ”
At issue is Texas ’ s long-standing quest to avail itself of federal taxpayer funds to provide contraceptives and basic reproductive care to low-income , uninsured women , while also barring those women from choosing to seek services at Planned Parenthood or other clinics the state believes “ affiliate ” with abortion providers .
Medicaid rules require that patients in the federal fee-for-service program be able to access care from any qualified and willing provider — a long-standing provision designed to ensure choice when it comes to family planning and gynecological services . Texas disapproves of that rule and for years has sought to have it waived . The federal government ’ s announcement on January 22 gave Texas that permission — and , advocates for women ’ s reproductive health care fear , may now provide an avenue for other states to follow Texas ’ s lead . The federal government has never before allowed the provider-of-choice rule to be waived for a family planning program .
“ The bottom line here is that the government is once again putting ideology ahead of patient needs , ” said Robin Summers , senior counsel and vice president of health care strategy and analysis for the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association . “ You ’ re supposed to be focused on furthering patient access , improving patient health . And that just doesn ’ t seem to be what is at the top of the priority list right now . ”
Texas has the highest rate of uninsured people in the country : nearly 18 percent . Even more abysmal , nearly 26 percent of women of reproductive age are uninsured — more than double the national average . This problem is exacerbated by stringent Medicaid requirements ; parental income above $ 302 per month is enough to render a family of three ineligible for the program . Not only has the state refused to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act , but it is also leading the charge to have the ACA ruled unconstitutional .
The kind of Medicaid waiver program that the feds approved for Texas generally allows states to opt out of certain rules in favor of innovation in health care delivery . In the mid-2000s , Texas did just that when it asked to waive financial eligibility rules in order to expand access to reproductive health care for women not poor enough to qualify for Medicaid unless they were pregnant .
Known as the Women ’ s Health Program , the pilot got off the ground in 2007 and expanded rapidly . In 2008 alone , the program reduced the number of unintended pregnancies that Medicaid would have paid for by more than 10,000 , saving taxpayers more than $ 92 million . By the end of 2011 , nearly 130,000 clients had enrolled in the program , with 90 percent of them accessing services . It was a clear success .
Still , Republican state lawmakers were determined to defund Planned Parenthood from all state programs by any means necessary . At the time , Planned Parenthood was serving more than 40 percent of Women ’ s Health Program clients , making it the single largest provider . State lawmakers came up with a new rule that would bar any group “ affiliated ” with an abortion provider from participating in the program . The federal government balked and said that if the state did not remove the ban , it would not reauthorize federal funding for the waiver program .
So Texas pulled out of the federal deal , rebranded the Women ’ s Health Program , barred Planned Parenthood , and funded the program solely with state money . It hasn ’ t exactly worked out . The program , now known as Healthy Texas Women , floundered for years with enrollment steadily declining — down to an average monthly enrollment of 94,851 by fiscal year 2016 . The state subsequently launched a concerted outreach campaign and enrollment increased , up to 244,153 in 2018 . Still , the percentage of patients served has continued to lag ; in 2018 , roughly 70 percent of enrolled clients actually accessed services . This is at least in part due to the fact that while the state signed up thousands of potential providers after ousting Planned Parenthood — including individual doctors ’ offices — a majority of them haven ’ t served any clients . In 2018 , according to the state ’ s Health and Human Services Commission , just 10 percent of providers enrolled in the program billed for services provided .
Moreover , research from the Texas Policy Evaluation Project at the University of Texas ’ s Population Research Center found that after the state bounced Planned Parenthood ( and other smaller providers ) from the program , the number of women receiving long-acting reversible contraceptives — the most effective forms of birth control — decreased by 35 percent . The number of women receiving injectable contraceptives declined by 31 percent , while Medicaid-paid births among this cohort increased by 27 percent .

The decision is a lobbying victory for millions of establishments that serve food — including restaurants , movie theaters , and amusement parks — that fall under the regulation and pushed for a delay . Existing research has not shown calorie labels to be effective in nudging consumers to pick healthier meals .
Calorie labels are coming soon to a fast-food restaurant near you
The White House will give businesses more time to comply with the Obamacare provision requiring them to post calorie labels on menus , the Food and Drug Administration announced Thursday .
The new regulations will hit millions of establishments that serve food and not just traditional restaurants . Businesses from coffee shops to movie theaters to amusement parks have to comply — and just got a little more time to do so .
The menu labels are part of Obamacare — and the subject of a huge lobbying fight
Tucked away on page 455 of the Affordable Care Act , Section 4205 requires `` retail food establishments '' with 20 or more locations to post `` on the menu listing the item for sale , the number of calories contained in the standard menu item . '' Section 4205 also contains similar requirements for vending machines , requiring vending machine operators to `` provide a sign in close proximity to each article of food or the selection button that includes a clear and conspicuous statement disclosing the number of calories contained in the article . ''
Section 4205 is really short , fewer than three pages . It was ambiguous about which establishments would fall under the new guidance . Fast-food restaurants like McDonald 's would obviously make the cut , but establishments that did n't sell food as their primary business — amusement parks , for example — were in a gray area . Grocery stores griped to the Obama administration about the regulatory burden . Movie theaters had lobbied vigorously to have their 1,000-calorie popcorns excluded from the labeling requirement .
And initially , they won : The Food and Drug Administration 's 2011 draft regulation proposed excluding establishments that had a primary business other than selling food . This would cover , according to the FDA , `` movie theaters , amusement parks , general merchandise stores with in-house concession stands , hotels , and transportation carriers such as trains and airplanes . ''
The White House 's final menu label rules are more aggressive than initial drafts — but now they 're on hold
The FDA got pushback on that decision from some Democratic legislators this summer , who sent the agency a letter arguing that movie theaters ought to post labels , too .
`` The aim was not to confine the scope of the law solely to restaurants … but to apply broadly to restaurants as well as other retail food establishments , '' Sen. Tom Harkin ( D-IA ) and Rep. Rosa DeLauro ( D-CT ) wrote in an August letter . `` The proposed definition is narrower than that intended by Congress . ''

Calorie labels are coming soon to a fast-food restaurant near you

The White House will give businesses more time to comply with the Obamacare provision requiring them to post calorie labels on menus, the Food and Drug Administration announced Thursday.

The new regulations will hit millions of establishments that serve food and not just traditional restaurants. Businesses from coffee shops to movie theaters to amusement parks have to comply — and just got a little more time to do so.

The menu labels are part of Obamacare — and the subject of a huge lobbying fight

Tucked away on page 455 of the Affordable Care Act, Section 4205 requires ""retail food establishments"" with 20 or more locations to post ""on the menu listing the item for sale, the number of calories contained in the standard menu item."" Section 4205 also contains similar requirements for vending machines, requiring vending machine operators to ""provide a sign in close proximity to each article of food or the selection button that includes a clear and conspicuous statement disclosing the number of calories contained in the article.""

Obamacare's ambiguity: Who should post menu labels?

Section 4205 is really short, fewer than three pages. It was ambiguous about which establishments would fall under the new guidance. Fast-food restaurants like McDonald's would obviously make the cut, but establishments that didn't sell food as their primary business — amusement parks, for example — were in a gray area. Grocery stores griped to the Obama administration about the regulatory burden. Movie theaters had lobbied vigorously to have their 1,000-calorie popcorns excluded from the labeling requirement.

And initially, they won: The Food and Drug Administration's 2011 draft regulation proposed excluding establishments that had a primary business other than selling food. This would cover, according to the FDA, ""movie theaters, amusement parks, general merchandise stores with in-house concession stands, hotels, and transportation carriers such as trains and airplanes.""

The White House's final menu label rules are more aggressive than initial drafts — but now they're on hold

The FDA got pushback on that decision from some Democratic legislators this summer, who sent the agency a letter arguing that movie theaters ought to post labels, too.

""The aim was not to confine the scope of the law solely to restaurants … but to apply broadly to restaurants as well as other retail food establishments,"" Sen. Tom Harkin (D-IA) and Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-CT) wrote in an August letter. ""The proposed definition is narrower than that intended by Congress.""

A summary of the final regulations, released Monday, suggests the FDA heeded that advice: The agency will take a more sweeping view of who falls under the label law. The agency provided this sample list of the types of establishments that the FDA will include.

The addition of alcoholic beverages is also new in this final regulation. The New York Times talked to FDA officials who said the labeling requirement would cover ""beverages served in food establishments that are on menus and menu boards"" but not drinks mixed at a bar.

Now menu labeling opponents appear to have won at least one victory: delaying the signage from going up until December 2016.

Will calorie labels make people healthier?

Public health research gives reason to be skeptical that calorie labels will significantly change people's eating habits. Not all consumers notice the calorie information. And among those who do, the body of research slightly leans against these labels changing behaviors.

Calorie labels don't always change what people eat

It found that New York City residents certainly noticed the new calorie labels. Some said they would buy fewer calories, too. But at the end of the day, they didn't follow through. New York City residents studied here, who came from low-income demographics, purchased the same amount of calories before and after the labels came online. You'll notice a slight uptick in the chart below, although the authors note it's statistically insignificant.

healthcare,Vox,0,http://www.vox.com/2015/9/4/9252489/anti-vaxx-wife,I thought all anti-vaxxers were idiots. Then I married one.,2015-09-04,Adam Mongrain,"Almost everyone believes the following : Vaccines are a good and necessary part of medicine .
Some people , and more people every day , believe this , too : Those who do n't believe in the virtues of vaccines — anti-vaxxers — are ignorant and dangerous lunatics , possibly evil .
I spent most of my life believing that . During my early 20s , I lived in the skeptic blogosphere , a mid-2000s constellation of internet communities theoretically organized around highly charismatic bloggers , vloggers , and other intellectuals . In practice , however , these groups were centered on a more basic principle : hostility toward anyone and anything it deemed `` irrational . '' It was then and is still now a very white , male , and defensive place .
It was there that I developed a deep antipathy toward the anti-vaccination movement . It was n't that I knew they were wrong about vaccines . It was more than that . I believed myself intellectually and morally superior to those people , and I reinforced that belief each time I left a comment or watched a vlog or republished a snarky article on the subject . I mastered a face , a kind of appalled , disapproving look for any time anybody even broached the subject of vaccine skepticism .
I met my wife nine years ago . I wanted to take up swing dancing and decided to take a private class to get over some of my anxiety . She was the teacher who picked up the phone when I called .
I was immediately attracted to her , but at the time she was engaged to her dancing partner , the father of her daughter .
So at first we built a platonic friendship . We spent time together . We bonded over our mutual interest in dancing . I had known her for more than a year the first time she mentioned that her daughter was not vaccinated .
What do you do , then , when someone you believe is both smart and sensible comes to a conclusion you find completely wrong ? Does that person stop being smart at that precise moment ?
My time reading ( arrogant ) skeptic blogs had convinced me of my moral and intellectual superiority . I believed that because I was a smart , sensible , and empathetic person I could see the value of vaccines . Yet here this woman was . I knew she was n't dumb — in fact , I thought she was very insightful . I knew she was n't dangerous or conspiratorial — we had talked for days about how we care about people , and the society we live in , and what it means to be human . I already trusted her .
Did I have to completely reassess my opinion of this person ? Did I have to examine my own biases and mental caricatures , decide that anti-vaxxers are people too ?
Well , no . I did what most people did : opted for cognitive dissonance . I decided it was n't worth getting into a fight over , that she could be my friend and have weird opinions about vaccines at the same time . Even as she broke up with her partner , and I broke up with mine , and we found ourselves spending a lot of time together , I ignored the issue . The subject of vaccines came up once or twice over dinners , but so what ? I could see she loved and cared deeply for her daughter . She was someone I admired and respected and was beginning to love . Vaccines did n't get in the way .
And , of course , I believed that if we spent enough time together , I 'd eventually change her mind .
It 's not that anti-vaxxers are stupid , or that they 're corrupt . It 's that they 're afraid .
This is the beating heart of any real discussion about anti-vaxxers . It 's impossible to understand their position without considering the amount of fear that goes into the anti-vaccine narrative , and considering how people construct and deal with fear .
I believed that if we spent enough time together , I 'd eventually change her mind
Now , you might think that a fear is a fear and public health is something else — and you might be right . That 's the rational point of view . But then , how rational are your own fears ?
Maybe you 're afraid of heights . Maybe it 's spiders . In either case , you 're lucky : Coping with your fear the way most people do — avoidance — does n't come at a cost to others . But vaccines only work when everyone buys in . Public health depends on anti-vaxxers confronting their greatest fears for the benefit of others .
For people who do n't share their fear , it 's very easy and convenient to demand that anti-vaxxers just suck it up and take the shot . I wish they would , too . But we 'll never get there by bullying them , by insulting and demeaning them and refusing to take the fact of their fear seriously , even if there is n't much that 's serious in its content .
That 's hard to do . Have you ever tried to stare a loved one into the eye and tell her you are going to put her child in danger ?
Despite initially avoiding the subject , I decided , after we were married , that I should convince my wife to vaccinate her daughter . Vaccines are good , after all . Vaccines are safe . Measles outbreaks had been on the news — what better time to raise the subject ?
But when I did , I realized that from her perspective , all of my confrontational reasoning sounded like me asking to point a gun at her daughter and have her trust that it was full of blanks . Looking into her eyes , I realized her trust in me was threatened . She asked why I would do that to a child . All of my insistence that vaccines are safe did n't matter . Go tell arachnophobic parents that you must put spiders on their child because society depends on it , and see how that goes . The benefits of getting the shot , expressed in the abstract , simply could not overpower the immediate , disarming fear .
So I backed down . The anti-vax position was not a deal breaker for me , but suggesting that we should expose her daughter to grave dangers for no good reason was a deal breaker for my wife . I loved my wife . I had no desire to end things . Yes , I think it was very important for her daughter to receive vaccines — but it 's not as if my wife would have changed her mind over a breakup fight .
I backed down and resolved to have that conversation in less confrontational terms when the opportunity arose .
3 ) If you think something is dangerous , it 's logical to avoid it
My wife is one of the smartest , most sensible people I know . So what do smart , sensible people do when they perceive a threat ? They do the smart , sensible thing : take precautions and warn others .
Again , it 's easy to dismiss the worries of anti-vaxxers as irrational and chalk up their activism to paranoid behavior , but this misses a crucial point : The reasoning , once you accept the big , unsubstantiated premise , is valid . It is n't even that far-fetched , if you do n't think about it too hard : There are some heartbreaking precedents that feed this logic . Lead paint , tobacco , bloodletting — every time we feel the urge to reply , `` But vaccines are safe , everyone knows that , '' we ought to remember that the same sentence has been said , earnestly and confidently , about things that absolutely were hazardous .
Go tell arachnophobic parents that you must put spiders on their child because society depends on it , and see how that goes
If you 've come to believe that vaccines are dangerous , then anti-vax behavior follows almost rationally . If we want to reach these people , dismissing their logic as ridiculous or fringe is the worst strategy . It plays right into the anti-vaccination narrative : that they are the `` only sane ones , '' warning the careless masses about a very real and hidden danger .
My wife ( and her family ) sincerely believes that though her worries are being recognized as irrational , they are n't . It 's easy to imagine how the very first person to notice the dangers of something ubiquitous , like lead , was dismissed by her peers as irrationally afraid — and to imagine you might be one of these people . The first anti-lead folks were called cranks — until they were proven right .
My point is n't that the anti-vaxxers might be right . They 're not . My point is that once you believe something untrue , it 's very easy to keep rationalizing that belief . It 's very easy to dismiss your critics as shortsighted . And when you 're constantly attacked , it 's natural to make your resilience part of your identity , to become even more committed to maintaining it .
People are not essays , where you can go back to a previous paragraph and undermine the priors through careful , unperturbed dissection . People talk , and people balk . My wife would not stand to have me pick her apart like she is a problem that needs to be solved ; her priors — like everyone else 's — are part of her identity . All of us have beliefs of this sort ; it 's just that most of us can get away with them more easily . We need to stop seeing anti-vaxxers as people who can be persuaded to abandon a bad idea , and instead as people we 're asking to abandon a part of themselves — people whose defensive sense of identity we 've encouraged with bad tactics .
4 ) There 's an industry supporting anti-vaxxers — and we 're driving them into its arms
A sense of identity is n't the only thing that makes anti-vaxxers impervious to confrontational argument . If you take a deeply controversial position , especially in the beginning , you wo n't last long without a strong support system . Unfortunately , fear sells — and there 's always someone willing to give you that support for a price .
Evidently , people who do n't trust or value conventional medicine still get sick . In Canada , where I live , socialized health care covers almost all conventional health-care costs , but there is a serious private market for people who would rather get their treatments from alternative sources . These alternative sources can do some good : Sick people need care , and some amount of care is usually better than no care at all .

When you 're in the business of selling treatments against a subsidized competitor , your pitch needs to be emotive , essential . It needs to appeal to the values of your audience . Since there is a real economy hinging on people not trusting conventional medicine , its actors churn out sensationalist scare pieces by the truckload , which validates the preexisting anxieties of anti-vaxxers ad nauseam — and drive them into the arms of the people willing to sell them a solution .

My sister-in-law is also a big part of my wife 's support network .

Of course , it 's not uniquely devious for anti-vaxxers to seek like-minded people to validate their views ; we all do it .

A lack of personal investment is , as it happens , what led to my wife 's initial rejection of vaccines : She had a very unfortunate run-in with a complacent MD in her late teens , while she was going through a lot of pain physically and mentally .
It started with a drug-induced psychotic breakdown .

She got out with a prescription and an unshakable feeling that this doctor , and his clinic , and the government that paid for his services , did not care at all about her concerns , her needs , and her fears . That she was a problem that could be solved with a couple of pills . That the fear she had felt for her sanity was not respected , not even considered .

I do think minds can be changed and hearts can be won , but I 've made my peace : Only love , patience , and empathy will make inroads .

`` Not with your classmates , '' my wife said . `` But yes , it 's time . We 'll schedule an appointment with our new family doctor . ''","Almost everyone believes the following: Vaccines are a good and necessary part of medicine.

Some people, and more people every day, believe this, too: Those who don't believe in the virtues of vaccines — anti-vaxxers — are ignorant and dangerous lunatics, possibly evil.

I spent most of my life believing that. During my early 20s, I lived in the skeptic blogosphere, a mid-2000s constellation of internet communities theoretically organized around highly charismatic bloggers, vloggers, and other intellectuals. In practice, however, these groups were centered on a more basic principle: hostility toward anyone and anything it deemed ""irrational."" It was then and is still now a very white, male, and defensive place.

It was there that I developed a deep antipathy toward the anti-vaccination movement. It wasn't that I knew they were wrong about vaccines. It was more than that. I believed myself intellectually and morally superior to those people, and I reinforced that belief each time I left a comment or watched a vlog or republished a snarky article on the subject. I mastered a face, a kind of appalled, disapproving look for any time anybody even broached the subject of vaccine skepticism.

Then I married an anti-vaxxer.

Here's what I learned.

1) Anti-vaxxers aren't paranoid misfits

I met my wife nine years ago. I wanted to take up swing dancing and decided to take a private class to get over some of my anxiety. She was the teacher who picked up the phone when I called.

I was immediately attracted to her, but at the time she was engaged to her dancing partner, the father of her daughter.

So at first we built a platonic friendship. We spent time together. We bonded over our mutual interest in dancing. I had known her for more than a year the first time she mentioned that her daughter was not vaccinated.

What do you do, then, when someone you believe is both smart and sensible comes to a conclusion you find completely wrong? Does that person stop being smart at that precise moment?

My time reading (arrogant) skeptic blogs had convinced me of my moral and intellectual superiority. I believed that because I was a smart, sensible, and empathetic person I could see the value of vaccines. Yet here this woman was. I knew she wasn't dumb — in fact, I thought she was very insightful. I knew she wasn't dangerous or conspiratorial — we had talked for days about how we care about people, and the society we live in, and what it means to be human. I already trusted her.

Did I have to completely reassess my opinion of this person? Did I have to examine my own biases and mental caricatures, decide that anti-vaxxers are people too?

Well, no. I did what most people did: opted for cognitive dissonance. I decided it wasn't worth getting into a fight over, that she could be my friend and have weird opinions about vaccines at the same time. Even as she broke up with her partner, and I broke up with mine, and we found ourselves spending a lot of time together, I ignored the issue. The subject of vaccines came up once or twice over dinners, but so what? I could see she loved and cared deeply for her daughter. She was someone I admired and respected and was beginning to love. Vaccines didn't get in the way.

And, of course, I believed that if we spent enough time together, I'd eventually change her mind.

2) It's all about fear

It's not that anti-vaxxers are stupid, or that they're corrupt. It's that they're afraid.

This is the beating heart of any real discussion about anti-vaxxers. It's impossible to understand their position without considering the amount of fear that goes into the anti-vaccine narrative, and considering how people construct and deal with fear.

I believed that if we spent enough time together, I'd eventually change her mind

Now, you might think that a fear is a fear and public health is something else — and you might be right. That's the rational point of view. But then, how rational are your own fears?

Maybe you're afraid of heights. Maybe it's spiders. In either case, you're lucky: Coping with your fear the way most people do — avoidance — doesn't come at a cost to others. But vaccines only work when everyone buys in. Public health depends on anti-vaxxers confronting their greatest fears for the benefit of others.

For people who don't share their fear, it's very easy and convenient to demand that anti-vaxxers just suck it up and take the shot. I wish they would, too. But we'll never get there by bullying them, by insulting and demeaning them and refusing to take the fact of their fear seriously, even if there isn't much that's serious in its content.

That's hard to do. Have you ever tried to stare a loved one into the eye and tell her you are going to put her child in danger?

Despite initially avoiding the subject, I decided, after we were married, that I should convince my wife to vaccinate her daughter. Vaccines are good, after all. Vaccines are safe. Measles outbreaks had been on the news — what better time to raise the subject?

But when I did, I realized that from her perspective, all of my confrontational reasoning sounded like me asking to point a gun at her daughter and have her trust that it was full of blanks. Looking into her eyes, I realized her trust in me was threatened. She asked why I would do that to a child. All of my insistence that vaccines are safe didn't matter. Go tell arachnophobic parents that you must put spiders on their child because society depends on it, and see how that goes. The benefits of getting the shot, expressed in the abstract, simply could not overpower the immediate, disarming fear.

So I backed down. The anti-vax position was not a deal breaker for me, but suggesting that we should expose her daughter to grave dangers for no good reason was a deal breaker for my wife. I loved my wife. I had no desire to end things. Yes, I think it was very important for her daughter to receive vaccines — but it's not as if my wife would have changed her mind over a breakup fight.

I backed down and resolved to have that conversation in less confrontational terms when the opportunity arose.

3) If you think something is dangerous, it's logical to avoid it

My wife is one of the smartest, most sensible people I know. So what do smart, sensible people do when they perceive a threat? They do the smart, sensible thing: take precautions and warn others.

What do you think anti-vaxxers believe they're doing?

Again, it's easy to dismiss the worries of anti-vaxxers as irrational and chalk up their activism to paranoid behavior, but this misses a crucial point: The reasoning, once you accept the big, unsubstantiated premise, is valid. It isn't even that far-fetched, if you don't think about it too hard: There are some heartbreaking precedents that feed this logic. Lead paint, tobacco, bloodletting — every time we feel the urge to reply, ""But vaccines are safe, everyone knows that,"" we ought to remember that the same sentence has been said, earnestly and confidently, about things that absolutely were hazardous.

Go tell arachnophobic parents that you must put spiders on their child because society depends on it, and see how that goes

If you've come to believe that vaccines are dangerous, then anti-vax behavior follows almost rationally. If we want to reach these people, dismissing their logic as ridiculous or fringe is the worst strategy. It plays right into the anti-vaccination narrative: that they are the ""only sane ones,"" warning the careless masses about a very real and hidden danger.

My wife (and her family) sincerely believes that though her worries are being recognized as irrational, they aren't. It's easy to imagine how the very first person to notice the dangers of something ubiquitous, like lead, was dismissed by her peers as irrationally afraid — and to imagine you might be one of these people. The first anti-lead folks were called cranks — until they were proven right.

My point isn't that the anti-vaxxers might be right. They're not. My point is that once you believe something untrue, it's very easy to keep rationalizing that belief. It's very easy to dismiss your critics as shortsighted. And when you're constantly attacked, it's natural to make your resilience part of your identity, to become even more committed to maintaining it.

People are not essays, where you can go back to a previous paragraph and undermine the priors through careful, unperturbed dissection. People talk, and people balk. My wife would not stand to have me pick her apart like she is a problem that needs to be solved; her priors — like everyone else's — are part of her identity. All of us have beliefs of this sort; it's just that most of us can get away with them more easily. We need to stop seeing anti-vaxxers as people who can be persuaded to abandon a bad idea, and instead as people we're asking to abandon a part of themselves — people whose defensive sense of identity we've encouraged with bad tactics.

4) There's an industry supporting anti-vaxxers — and we're driving them into its arms

A sense of identity isn't the only thing that makes anti-vaxxers impervious to confrontational argument. If you take a deeply controversial position, especially in the beginning, you won't last long without a strong support system. Unfortunately, fear sells — and there's always someone willing to give you that support for a price.

Evidently, people who don't trust or value conventional medicine still get sick. In Canada, where I live, socialized health care covers almost all conventional health-care costs, but there is a serious private market for people who would rather get their treatments from alternative sources. These alternative sources can do some good: Sick people need care, and some amount of care is usually better than no care at all. But the alternative health industry is also a business, and at its worst, this is how the business works: Articles about children turning ""autistic"" after a shot are circulated by authors selling books, websites selling ads, and merchants selling cures. When you're in the business of selling treatments against a subsidized competitor, your pitch needs to be emotive, essential. It needs to appeal to the values of your audience. Since there is a real economy hinging on people not trusting conventional medicine, its actors churn out sensationalist scare pieces by the truckload, which validates the preexisting anxieties of anti-vaxxers ad nauseam — and drive them into the arms of the people willing to sell them a solution.

Support networks can also come from somewhere closer to home.

Back when my wife and I were just friends, I met her sister a couple of times. She is a very pleasant, completely agreeable, and naturally sociable person. I really had no reason to be anything less than friendly to her. Then my wife told me that her sister is a naturopath who studied the toxic effects of vaccines ""extensively.""

My sister-in-law is also a big part of my wife's support network. When my wife is second-guessing herself about vaccines — like when her daughter's father raised the issue after their separation — she turns to her sister. Her sister is even deeper in the movement that she is — she's a provider of alternative medicines by trade — and when they talk, my wife comes away more sure of the anti-vax worldview. Again: This isn't a strange behavior. How many times have you wondered about something important, only to be reassured by a conversation with a loved one?

One of the reasons I like many of the newspapers and magazines I like, for instance, is because they tell me things I already think about foreign policy, urbanism, feminism, and race — we all suffer from confirmation bias to some extent. But unlike more ordinary biases, the alternative medicine racket is completely unchecked; by definition, it eschews mainstream checks on its theories and practices. It cashes in on encouraging the isolation and dependence of its participants. This is an environment in which every hypothesis is given equal weight, and all of them come packaged with some kind of product recommendation.

Without a profitable industry, anti-vax beliefs might not survive long. But again, what do we do? The monolithic media presence of the vaccination narrative gives skeptics an ""assaulted and oppressed"" outlook that encourages its members to seek out corners that coddle their worldviews. Those corners then sell them back their own biases — and they become even more confident that they're right.

I didn't have to say anything.

It 's on his to-do list , but U.S. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell says the odds are against repealing the health care law championed by President Barack Obama . The Kentucky Republican said Monday it 's hard to unravel something of the magnitude of the 2,700-page health care law , WHAS-TV ( http : //bit.ly/LSUtqX ) reports . `` If you thought it was a good idea for the federal government to go in this direction , I 'd say the odds are still on your side , '' McConnell said . `` Because it 's a lot harder to undo something than it is to stop it in the first place . '' McConnell discussed the law in comments to about 50 people at Hardin Memorial Hospital in Elizabethtown . The state 's senior senator was making stops at Kentucky hospitals discussing what 's next since last week 's ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court 's that the law was constitutional . The court upheld the law 's crucial mandate that individuals buy health insurance or face a penalty . Chief Justice John Roberts , a conservative , provided the pivotal vote in that decision by ruling that the penalty was legal under the government 's taxing authority . While technically handing a political victory to Obama , Roberts ' ruling invigorated Republicans eager to cast the law as a new tax .
There is , of course , no denying the fact that once the federal government passes a massive new entitlement program ( i.e . Obamacare ) it ’ s almost impossible to repeal it . But my own view on the subject is somewhat less cynical . As many have argued , the surest way to throw out Obamacare – a law more than half of Americans have consistently despised since it was first signed into law two years ago – is electing new members of Congress as well as a new president . And while it ’ s impossible to predict whether Mitt Romney will defeat President Obama in November , recent polls suggest the presumptive Republican nominee is in very good shape . Presumably , also , if Mitt Romney wins the presidential election Republicans will have a very good shot at retaking the Senate . And that , in turn , would be encouraging news .
If given control of the Senate next year , McConnell said he would support using budget reconciliation rules to repeal it . Doing so would prohibit Senate filibusters and require only 51 votes to succeed . In 2010 , Republicans lambasted Democrats for relying on these rules to pass the health care bill , calling their tactics unusual and hyperpartisan .
Incidentally , as Kate noted in her post-Supreme Court ruling write-up , Chief Justice John Robert ’ s controversial decision to uphold the law on the thinnest of grounds may in fact make is easier for lawmakers to repeal it . Indeed , while the constitutionality of the mandate has been resolved , millions of Americans will now be forced to forgo buying health insurance rather than purchase something they simply can ’ t afford . In some ways , the Supreme Court ’ s 5-4 decision to uphold the law changes exactly nothing . Millions of Americans will still be uninsured , health care costs will still be too high , and all Americans – including those who refuse to buy health insurance – will still be taxed . In short , if this isn ’ t motivation enough to elect leaders – leaders who will repeal and replace Obamacare with more practical and sensible reforms -- I don ’ t know what will .","In the aftermath of the much-anticipated Supreme Court ruling on the constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) last week, in which Chief Justice John Roberts essentially saved the president’s “signature” legislative achievement, Senate Minority leader Mitch McConnell is now unsure whether lawmakers in Congress will be able to repeal the president’s unpopular health care law.

""Because it's a lot harder to undo something than it is to stop it in the first place."" McConnell discussed the law in comments to about 50 people at Hardin Memorial Hospital in Elizabethtown. The state's senior senator was making stops at Kentucky hospitals discussing what's next since last week's ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court's that the law was constitutional. The court upheld the law's crucial mandate that individuals buy health insurance or face a penalty. Chief Justice John Roberts, a conservative, provided the pivotal vote in that decision by ruling that the penalty was legal under the government's taxing authority. While technically handing a political victory to Obama, Roberts' ruling invigorated Republicans eager to cast the law as a new tax.

There is, of course, no denying the fact that once the federal government passes a massive new entitlement program (i.e. Obamacare) it’s almost impossible to repeal it. But my own view on the subject is somewhat less cynical. As many have argued, the surest way to throw out Obamacare – a law more than half of Americans have consistently despised since it was first signed into law two years ago – is electing new members of Congress as well as a new president. And while it’s impossible to predict whether Mitt Romney will defeat President Obama in November, recent polls suggest the presumptive Republican nominee is in very good shape. Presumably, also, if Mitt Romney wins the presidential election Republicans will have a very good shot at retaking the Senate. And that, in turn, would be encouraging news.

If given control of the Senate next year, McConnell said he would support using budget reconciliation rules to repeal it. Doing so would prohibit Senate filibusters and require only 51 votes to succeed. In 2010, Republicans lambasted Democrats for relying on these rules to pass the health care bill, calling their tactics unusual and hyperpartisan.

Incidentally, as Kate noted in her post-Supreme Court ruling write-up, Chief Justice John Robert’s controversial decision to uphold the law on the thinnest of grounds may in fact make is easier for lawmakers to repeal it. Indeed, while the constitutionality of the mandate has been resolved, millions of Americans will now be forced to forgo buying health insurance rather than purchase something they simply can’t afford. In some ways, the Supreme Court’s 5-4 decision to uphold the law changes exactly nothing. Millions of Americans will still be uninsured, health care costs will still be too high, and all Americans – including those who refuse to buy health insurance – will still be taxed. In short, if this isn’t motivation enough to elect leaders – leaders who will repeal and replace Obamacare with more practical and sensible reforms -- I don’t know what will.",www.townhall.com,right,KwN8yNiVm2KkvKch

Ebola exposed significant weaknesses in the USA's ability to handle infectious disease outbreaks, according to a report that gives the nation low grades in preparedness.

On a scale of 1 to 10, half the states and Washington, D.C., scored a 5 or lower, according to the report released today by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Trust for America's Health. Arkansas received a 2, the lowest score. The highest score was an 8 earned by five states: Maryland, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Vermont and Virginia.

The report scored states on measures as diverse as food safety, vaccination rates, hospital-associated infections and being prepared for emerging threats. Those threats included not just Ebola but also respiratory viruses such as pandemic flu, MERS (Middle-East Respiratory Virus) and enterovirus D68, a respiratory virus that has been diagnosed this year in 1,149 people, including 12 who died.

""The Ebola outbreak is a reminder that we cannot afford to let our guard down,"" says Jeffrey Levi, executive director of the Trust for America's Health.

The USA made numerous missteps with Ebola, says Lawrence Gostin, faculty director at Georgetown University's O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law.

""Where we erred badly with Ebola -- and where our greatest vulnerabilities lie -- was at the state and local level,"" Gostin says.

While many people look to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in a crisis, Gostin notes that the foundation of the public health system is local health departments and hospitals, because those are the places where sick people show up.

A Dallas emergency room sent home a Liberian national with a fever, for example, instead of testing him for Ebola. The man, Thomas Eric Duncan, was the USA's first Ebola case. He infected two of his nurses. While both nurses survived, Duncan died. Nurses around the country staged protests, saying hospitals were't adequately protecting them from Ebola.

In spite of widespread fears, though, Ebola has not caused widespread outbreaks. Thanks to excellent hospital care, eight of the 10 Ebola patients treated in U.S. hospitals survived, including all of the Americans, Gostin notes.

The USA could have fared far worse if Ebola spread as easily as influenza or other airborne viruses, Gostin says.

""We got off very easy,"" Gostin says. ""We have been extraordinarily lucky. ... We've dodged a bullet. But if we don't learn lessons from Ebola, we are going to pay for it someday.""

One of the biggest hurdles to preventing and controlling outbreaks of infectious disease is the lack of consistent funding, Levi says.

The nation increased public health funding after the 2001 terrorist attacks, only to slash that funding during the recession.

The CDC's budget shrank by 10% -- nearly $1 billion -- from 2012 to 2013. Twenty-two states and Washington, D.C., reduced their public health budgets from fiscal years 2012-2013 to 2013-2014, the new report says. State and local public health agencies have lost more than 50,000 staff members -- almost 20% of their workforce -- since 2008, according to the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.

In response to Ebola, Congress approved more than $6 billion in emergency funding.

The USA can't maintain a robust public health system by careening from one crisis to the next, Levi says. It takes time to train staff and develop public health systems that work well with surrounding cities, counties and states.

""When a fire breaks out, we don't hire and train a fire department that day,"" Levi says. ""And when the fire is out, we don't send them all away. We know there is a core capacity that we need to protect the public.""

Ebola has infected more than 18,600 people and killed 6,915, mostly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

Millions of Americans suffer from serious infectious diseases that get far less attention, the report says. More than 2 million preschoolers are vulnerable to life-threatening infections because they haven't received all of their vaccinations on time, the report notes. Low vaccination rates have contributed to measles outbreaks in recent years. The CDC has reported 609 measles cases so far this year, compared with 187 cases in 2013 and 55 in 2012.

The report, which was delivered at the end of March, identified six tests that the developing healthcare.gov website didn’t meet: Its needs were evolving, rather than clearly articulated; there was no clear definition of success; the program relied too heavily contractors and other outside parties; the design, build and test phases were stacked on top of each other rather than sequential, there wasn’t enough time allotted or a side enough scope for valid end-to-end testing of the system; and the site was expected to launch at full volume rather than phasing in over time.

The revelations of early warning signs, first reported by the Washington Post, are not the only ones to have been unearthed in the ongoing autopsy of the Obamacare rollout, but the previously undisclosed CMS “Red Team” report shows just how early and how specifically administration officials were notified about problems that ultimately plagued the website. In this case, the report, compiled by an outside consulting firm and provided by a source on Capitol Hill, pointed to issues that remained unresolved when the website launched six months later.

White House officials said that while the report hasn’t previously been disclosed, administration officials have been clear in the past in acknowledging that red flags were raised.

Even before the decision was announced , conservative writers railed that liberals and the so-called mainstream media were trying to intimidate the chief justice .
To cite just two examples : After President Obama expressed `` confidence '' in April that the court would uphold the law , Sen. Mike Johanns , R-Neb. , accused the president of `` threatening '' and `` intimidating '' the court . And Randy Barnett , the legal architect behind the challenges to the law , accused liberal commentators of trying to `` intimidate or threaten the Court with dire political consequences should it fail to uphold legislation that they strongly favor . ''
After the decision was announced , showing Roberts as the fifth and deciding vote to uphold the individual mandate under Congress ' taxing power , many conservatives began claiming that Roberts switched his vote midway through deliberations — a charge now backed by a CBS report that Roberts changed his mind .
The question of a vote switch in many ways misperceives how the Supreme Court works . The justices take an initial vote right after the case is argued . If the chief justice is in the majority , he assigns who will write the opinion . Roberts did that , and assigned the majority opinion to himself , as one would expect for such a major decision .
It is not uncommon for a justice to change his or her views as the opinion drafts are circulated . Usually , it is not the opinion writer who vacillates , but there are many famous cases of an opinion writer starting out in one direction and ending up in another .
In the 1992 abortion case Planned Parenthood v. Casey , for instance , the initial vote in conference was , in essence , to reverse Roe v. Wade . But three justices eventually coalesced around an opinion to uphold what they called `` the core of Roe , '' while partly trimming it back . And those three , coupled with the two justices who voted to uphold Roe entirely , composed the majority .
In another case , Lee v. Weisman , which tested the constitutionality of a prayer at a public school graduation , Justice Anthony Kennedy initially voted to allow the practice and was assigned to write the opinion for the five-justice majority . But as Kennedy later told his colleagues in a memo , his `` draft looked quite wrong .

In the days since the Supreme Court's historic health care ruling, there has been a good deal of speculation about whether Chief Justice John Roberts changed his mind in the course of deliberations, deciding late in the game to uphold the constitutionality of most of the law.

Even before the decision was announced, conservative writers railed that liberals and the so-called mainstream media were trying to intimidate the chief justice.

To cite just two examples: After President Obama expressed ""confidence"" in April that the court would uphold the law, Sen. Mike Johanns, R-Neb., accused the president of ""threatening"" and ""intimidating"" the court. And Randy Barnett, the legal architect behind the challenges to the law, accused liberal commentators of trying to ""intimidate or threaten the Court with dire political consequences should it fail to uphold legislation that they strongly favor.""

After the decision was announced, showing Roberts as the fifth and deciding vote to uphold the individual mandate under Congress' taxing power, many conservatives began claiming that Roberts switched his vote midway through deliberations — a charge now backed by a CBS report that Roberts changed his mind.

The question of a vote switch in many ways misperceives how the Supreme Court works. The justices take an initial vote right after the case is argued. If the chief justice is in the majority, he assigns who will write the opinion. Roberts did that, and assigned the majority opinion to himself, as one would expect for such a major decision.

It is not uncommon for a justice to change his or her views as the opinion drafts are circulated. Usually, it is not the opinion writer who vacillates, but there are many famous cases of an opinion writer starting out in one direction and ending up in another.

In the 1992 abortion case Planned Parenthood v. Casey, for instance, the initial vote in conference was, in essence, to reverse Roe v. Wade. But three justices eventually coalesced around an opinion to uphold what they called ""the core of Roe,"" while partly trimming it back. And those three, coupled with the two justices who voted to uphold Roe entirely, composed the majority.

In another case, Lee v. Weisman, which tested the constitutionality of a prayer at a public school graduation, Justice Anthony Kennedy initially voted to allow the practice and was assigned to write the opinion for the five-justice majority. But as Kennedy later told his colleagues in a memo, his ""draft looked quite wrong."" He changed his mind, and ended up writing the opinion for a different five-justice majority, holding the practice unconstitutional.

This term's health care case had many more moving parts than most cases. The question of the mandate was just one of many the court had to address. After doing more than a dozen interviews, most off the record, I think it is fair to say that from the beginning, there were five votes, including Roberts', for the proposition that the Commerce Clause of the Constitution could not support the mandate. More ambiguous, however, was where Roberts stood on the question of whether the mandate could be upheld under Congress' taxing authority — a question that clearly interested him during oral arguments.

Since the announcement of the court's decision last week, conservatives have been pushing the notion that Roberts did something of a last-minute flip. But the evidence to support that is less than convincing.

For example, writers have noticed that the four dissenting conservatives call Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's decision ""the dissent,"" when in fact she was among the five-justice majority that voted to uphold the law. But the first reference to the Ginsburg dissent by the conservative minority refers to her dissent from the chief justice's opinion on the Commerce Clause. She and the court's three other liberals would have upheld the mandate as a legitimate exercise of Congress' commerce power. On this point she was writing a dissent.

The question remains: Did Roberts change his opinion at some point after the first conference on other questions, including the taxing power? I think there is a kernel of truth to the notion that he did, but again, these things are not like legislative votes. If, as seems likely, Roberts was somewhat ambiguous about his views on the taxing power, after mulling over the issue, talking to colleagues, it seems clear that by the time he circulated his first draft, probably sometime in May, he was not ambiguous. At that point, the court's four conservatives realized they had lost, and they were probably quite angry.

Justices are human, and when there is a big, historic case where there is the press of time, like this one or Bush v. Gore, there are hard feelings in the immediate aftermath.

What is unusual here is the apparent attempt to undermine the chief with a leak more typical of political combat.

Nobody knows definitively who the source of the leak is. But the CBS reporter whose story was based on the leak, Jan Crawford, is well-liked by conservatives.

President Obama meets with Democrats on Capitol Hill today, looking for ways to preserve his signature health care law in the face of stiff Republican opposition.

Senate Republicans have already taken the first step toward repealing Obamacare. On Tuesday, they introduced a budget resolution that would ultimately allow Republicans to unravel large parts of the Affordable Care Act with a simple majority vote.

Democrats still hope to defend the law, which has extended health insurance to some 20 million Americans. Repealing the law would very likely strip protection from many of those people. So far, Republicans have not reached agreement on how to replace Obamacare. And the outgoing administration mocks the idea of repeal now and replace later.

""That ultimately is nothing more than just bait and switch,"" said White House spokesman Josh Earnest.

The American Medical Association issued a similar note of caution in an open letter to lawmakers. The association, which supported the Affordable Care Act when it passed seven years ago, acknowledged that the law is imperfect, but said any effort to cut costs or increase choice should at least preserve the existing level of coverage.

While there are 8 million Americans who thought the health plans in Obamacare were a good deal, the Kaiser Family Foundation estimates there are 20 million more who decided not to sign up. For many of them, the existing prices were too high; one survey found that 39 percent of shoppers who didn't buy coverage cited ""the costs aren't worth it"" as the reason.

""Eight million people clearly found it affordable, but there are millions more that didn't buy,"" says the Kaiser Family Foundation's Larry Levitt. ""The test for affordability is how many people enroll next year, and the year after.""",www.vox.com,left,fATB6g44ktJAz0K8

The 2010 law spawned an entire line of litigation that has reached the Supreme Court three times and gone through myriad appeals courts . Until recently , rulings could be predicted reliably based on whether the judges were appointed by Democrats or Republicans .
Until a year ago , Democratic appointees ruled in favor of Obamacare more than 90 percent of the time , while Republican appointees ruled against the law nearly 80 percent of the time , according to a ███ review of substantive federal appellate opinions on the Affordable Care Act .

Analysts predict that the subsidies case , known as King v. Burwell , will come down to Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Anthony M.

Bellovin: Good project management is a remarkably large part of the effort

No one should be surprised by the technical problems that have plagued the new health insurance exchange website, HealthCare.gov , which allows millions of Americans to sign up and buy health coverage.

Angry, OK. Disappointed, of course. But surprised? Don't be.

Large-scale software projects are hard. Failures or delays in schedule, budget and functionality are so common as to almost be the norm, not the exception.

`` That ’ s not an accurate argument , '' says Avik Roy of the Manhattan Institute . `` If your plan is now covering a bunch of things that you don ’ t need , then how is it a better plan for you ? ''
Former Congressional Budget Office Director Doug Holtz-Eakin says there 's no evidence to support the president 's claim .
`` You can do the math , '' he says . `` Most of the policies in his claim could spend more , cover more things , provide more visits and charge less . '' But , he concludes , `` the arithmetic just does not work . ''
Obama ’ s remarks last month were an effort to deflect criticism for having earlier promised that people could keep their plans and doctors no matter what .
`` Most people , he said , `` will be able to buy better plans for the same price or even cheaper than what they 've gotten before . ''
A few days after that promise , the president appeared to downgrade the pledge somewhat , saying only that `` there 's a good chance that they 'll be able to buy better insurance at lower cost . ''
The promise that `` most people '' would be better off is sharply disputed by many , including a number of individuals experiencing sticker shock , including those with pre-existing conditions .
They include Tom Gialanella of Seattle , who had a policy that was renewed for years even after he had cancer -- not the kind of sub-standard policy the president likes to criticize .
But he says his new policy under ObamaCare `` went from $ 891 a month to $ 1,437 a month and also my deductibles all doubled . ''
Andrew Leonard recently told ███ ’ Greta Van Susteren that he `` would get the terrible , terrible plan with the $ 6,000 deductible . '' As far as the premiums are concerned , he said , `` I 'll pay $ 1,200 dollars a year for that and I 'll be less insured than I am today . ''
Analysts say those whose policies are canceled will get new coverage , but not at lower prices .
`` What we 're seeing is that the new ObamaCare plans typically have higher deductibles than the old plans did , '' says Roy , along with `` a narrower choice of doctors and hospitals and yet higher premiums . ''
David Hogberg of the National Center for Public Policy Research adds , '' It 's very easy for a bronze plan to have a deductible ( with ) total out of pocket costs that are $ 6,000 . ''
That , of course , means the individual does n't get a dollar of benefits until he or she has exceeded $ 6,000 in expenditures , much more than many young people spend on medical care .
Rosemary Gibson of the Hastings Center and author of `` The Battle Over Health Care '' points to a Nov. 14 letter from one of the top officials implementing the law that concedes subsidies wo n't help everyone .
She describes it as `` a letter from Gary Cohen to state health insurance commissioners saying while many people still have subsidies , there will still be some people who will be paying more than they were paying . ''
In fact , one insurance plan that asked not to be identified analyzed its pool of 375,000 people and found that , even after subsidies , only 10 percent would actually see a decrease in costs , while one third would face significant rate increases as a result of ObamaCare .","Is President Obama’s latest health care promise – that his plan will offer “most” people a better plan for the same price or less than their current policy – actually true?

That, of course, means the individual doesn't get a dollar of benefits until he or she has exceeded $6,000 in expenditures, much more than many young people spend on medical care.

Rosemary Gibson of the Hastings Center and author of ""The Battle Over Health Care"" points to a Nov. 14 letter from one of the top officials implementing the law that concedes subsidies won't help everyone.

She describes it as ""a letter from Gary Cohen to state health insurance commissioners saying while many people still have subsidies, there will still be some people who will be paying more than they were paying.""

In fact, one insurance plan that asked not to be identified analyzed its pool of 375,000 people and found that, even after subsidies, only 10 percent would actually see a decrease in costs, while one third would face significant rate increases as a result of ObamaCare.",www.foxnews.com,right,cSm5I2xHBOeccPT9

Obamacare’s third year of open enrollment began on Sunday. People hoping to sign up saw a website with fresh photos and high-tech features. They found the actual insurance of the president’s signature law has gotten even worse.

Unless something dramatic happens, this may be the year of the health care law’s collapse. Prices keep rising and service keeps fading. It should not surprise the administration that people are not signing up.

Despite all the Obama administration has done to completely upend health care in this country, there are still more than 30 million uninsured people in America today. The reason they’re not buying Obamacare isn’t because they haven’t heard enough about it. They’re not buying because it’s a bad deal for them.

As people log on to the government exchanges this year, they will see the telltale signs of Obamacare’s impending failure. These include: costs soaring, cancellations mounting, and choices disappearing.

The first thing most people will notice is the higher price tag. Premiums are jumping by double digits in many states. In Alaska, premiums will be nearly 40 percent higher next year. People buying insurance on the Minnesota exchange will pay anywhere from 14 to 49 percent more.

Premiums are just one part of the high-cost story. Many plans are raising deductibles, co-pays, and other out-of-pocket costs.

Remember when President Obama’s mantra was “If you like your health care plan, you can keep it?” Now the administration is singing a different tune: “If you have an Obamacare plan, you better shop around.”

That’s about the only advice Washington has for people who want to avoid brutal rate increases. If you’re willing to switch insurance plans each year, your rates may go up by slightly less.

For some people, their old plan won’t be available at any price. This includes more than a half-million people insured by one of the health co-ops that have shut down in 11 states over the past few months.

It also includes people whose insurer decided it simply couldn’t afford to sell Obamacare coverage anymore. That’s what happened in my home state, Wyoming, where the company WINHealth is dropping out of the exchange entirely.

In some states, plans are changing dramatically even if the company remains. A patient may find that her longtime doctor will no longer be a part of her plan’s network. Maybe the hospital nearest to her home is no longer included by her insurance. These kinds of changes can leave people with very different coverage than they had before.

As people work their way around the website, they may notice that the remaining options are slimmer than ever. Analysts at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation say that more of the choices will be HMOs this time around. That can mean narrower networks and no out-of-network coverage.

In some states, the number of options is practically non-existent. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, people living in 14 of Nevada’s 16 counties will have only one or two companies to pick from. In Wyoming, with the failure of WINHealth, residents will have only one option.

Insurance through Obamacare is largely coming down to a simple choice of take it or leave it. More and more Americans are leaving it.

The only people who are consistently signing up are the ones who get subsidies from Washington. For them, the website should come with a warning label reading: “Buyer beware.” According to the IRS, 90 percent of people who received government insurance subsidies last year got the wrong amount.

To avoid an all-out panic over low enrollment, the administration is trying to lower expectations. It’s lowered the bar for success to around 10 million people enrolled for 2016. That’s half of the 21 million people the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office says should be covered next year. It’s also essentially flat compared to the 9.9 million who were enrolled in June.

The administration is playing the lowered expectations game because they know how hard it is to convince more Americans to buy government-mandated insurance that costs so much. For so many people, Obamacare doesn’t have much to offer.

Even the $695 tax penalty isn’t enough incentive to coerce people to buy. People facing premium increases along with a $5,000 deductible see little reason to pay for insurance they may not want, need, or be able to afford.

Obamacare is failing because too many people want nothing to do with it. As the costs continue to rise, more people get cancellation notices, and the exchanges offer fewer choices, the collapse will only continue. We may look back at this past Sunday as the beginning of the end.

AMY GOODMAN : After weeks of secret deliberations , Republican senators Thursday released a healthcare bill that would reduce key benefits for millions of Americans . The Better Care Reconciliation Act would fund a large capital gains tax cut for the rich by removing millions of low-income and disabled people from Medicaid . According to the Center on Budget [ and ] Policy Priorities , $ 33 billion of the tax cuts would benefit the 400 wealthiest U.S. households . The Senate bill would also reduce subsidies to individuals to purchase health insurance , and would allow states to eliminate protections for people with pre-existing conditions . The measure would defund Planned Parenthood for a year , making breast cancer screenings and basic reproductive services more difficult for women to secure .
While drafting the legislation , President Trump had called on Republicans to improve the House plan by giving it more , quote , “ heart. ” The bill was negotiated behind closed doors between 13 Republican white male senators . This is Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell .
SEN. MITCH McCONNELL : We agreed on the need to free Americans from Obamacare ’ s mandates . And policies contained in the discussion draft will repeal the individual mandate , so Americans are no longer forced to buy insurance they don ’ t need or can ’ t afford ; will repeal the employer mandate , so Americans no longer see their hours and take-home pay cut by employers because of it .
AMY GOODMAN : Senator McConnell says he wants to vote on the healthcare bill next week , before Congress leaves for the Fourth of July recess . Republicans can only afford to lose two votes for the measure to pass with 50 votes . Four Republican senators—Rand Paul , Ted Cruz , Ron Johnson and Mike Lee—said Thursday they ’ ll oppose the bill in its current form , arguing it fails to cut Medicaid benefits enough . The bill is similar to a House measure that would leave more than 20 million Americans without health insurance . The Congressional Budget Office has yet to score the Senate bill . Democrats are firmly united against the bill . This is Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer .
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER : This is a bill designed to strip away healthcare benefits and protections from Americans who need it most , in order to give a tax break to the folks who need it least . This is a bill that would end Medicaid as we know it , rolling back Medicaid expansion , cutting federal support for the program even more than the House bill , which cut Medicaid by $ 800 billion .
AMY GOODMAN : This comes as scores of disabled protesters held a sit-in outside Senator Mitch McConnell ’ s office on Capitol Hill Thursday and demonstrators gathered at Washington , D.C. ’ s National Airport to target Republican lawmakers as they left town for their home states .
Also on Thursday , Barack Obama weighed in on efforts to scale back his signature healthcare law . He posted a scathing statement on Facebook that said , quote , “ The Senate bill , unveiled today , is not a health care bill . It ’ s a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America , ” President Obama said .
For more , we host a roundtable discussion with three guests . Joining us from Boston , John McDonough , professor at Harvard Chan School of Public Health , served as a senior adviser on national health reform to the U.S. Senate Committee on Health , Education , Labor and Pensions from 2008 to 2010 . And from 2003 to '08 , he served as executive director of Health Care for All in Massachusetts , playing a key role in passage of the 2006 Massachusetts health reform law . He 's the author of Inside National Health Reform .
Also in Boston , Dr. Steffie Woolhandler joins us , a professor at CUNY-Hunter College and a primary care physician . She ’ s a lecturer at Harvard Medical School and the co-founder of Physicians for a National Health Program . She is a well-known national advocate for Medicare for all .
And in Aspen , Colorado , we ’ re joined by Dr. Willie Parker , physician , abortion provider , and board chair of Physicians for Reproductive Health . His new book , Life ’ s Work : A Moral Argument for Choice .
We welcome you all back to ███ ! Let ’ s begin with Professor McDonough . Can you lay out what the Republicans presented , after weeks of secret negotiations with other Republicans ?
JOHN McDONOUGH : So , I think that the statements from Senator Schumer articulated it well . What is essentially going on here is the Affordable Care Act was an attempt to improve the nation ’ s healthcare system and expand coverage and deal with other issues . And it was paid for significantly by new taxes on wealthy Americans and some very powerful corporate interests . The new bill in the House , and reflected in the Senate , is an attempt to do major tax cuts for wealthy Americans and powerful corporate interests , financed by decimating the Medicaid program and other essential parts of the nation ’ s healthcare safety net . So , that is clearly what ’ s going on .
The Senate initially said , “ We will take the House bill and throw it away and start all over. ” Instead , what they ’ ve done is simply make a number of adjustments . If you look up close between the two , you can see many , many disagreements and differences of opinion on details , but if you stand back , they are essentially the same thing .
They fundamentally undermine the nation ’ s commitment to the Medicaid program , which covers about 75 million low-income and lower-income Americans by phasing out the expansion that was created in the Affordable Care Act and by fundamentally changing the financing of it , where they put a cap on it so that states will have no choice but begin to retrench back on the benefits . They continue the subsidies for private health insurance purchase for lower-middle-income Americans , but , again , they substantially degrade that coverage—for example , lowering the—what ’ s called the actuarial value , or how much benefit you get out of your premiums , from the ACA standard of 70 percent down to 58 percent , which means higher copays , higher deductibles , across the board . They defund Planned Parenthood for a year , but setting it up then to continue well into the future . They get rid of the Prevention and Public Health Trust Fund that has provided vital public health funds to the Centers for Disease Control as well as public health departments all over the country . You can go on and on . It ’ s hard to find something in the measure that one could say that ’ s good or at least not harmful . It ’ s pretty much bad from start to finish .
AMY GOODMAN : On the issue of Medicaid , we ’ re talking about Medicaid cut , overall , in half , something we haven ’ t seen in the history of Medicaid , both Medicaid expansion and Medicaid itself . And can you talk about who is covered by Medicaid ? Like half the babies born in this country are paid for by Medicaid .
JOHN McDONOUGH : Yeah , so , Medicaid is the primary insurance coverage program for low- and lower-income Americans , many children , most children in the United States—more children under Medicaid than any other kind of coverage—their parents , poor senior citizens , low-income disabled people and other working low-income adults , who have no other options for coverage . About a third of the Medicaid program consists of low-income senior citizens and disabled . They actually account for two-thirds of the spending on the program . And so , if you want to take a meat ax , which is what they ’ re doing , to the Medicaid program , it is really impossible to implement cuts at that level without having damaging impacts on low-income , disabled and elderly , as well as children , parents and families .
JOHN McDONOUGH : Nursing homes is very much a part of the benefits that low-income seniors get . Very few families have had seniors , grandparents or parents , who have gone into long-term care and not at some point needed help from Medicaid to pay for the cost of long-term care , which is just so unaffordable for most Americans .
AMY GOODMAN : Dr. Steffie Woolhandler , presumably , you only saw this starting yesterday . This was kept under wraps from many Republicans , as well as Democrats , in the Senate . And it ’ s interesting , the Republicans who are opposed to this . You have the group , like Mike Lee from Utah and Rand Paul from Kentucky , Ron Johnson from Wisconsin , who don ’ t—who feel that this doesn ’ t go far enough . But then you also have Senator Susan Collins from Maine , as well as Senator Murkowski from Alaska , who are deeply concerned that this , well , once again , as with the House bill , that apparently President Trump has called “ mean , ” will mean tens of millions of more Americans will lose their health insurance .
DR. STEFFIE WOOLHANDLER : Well , it certainly will . I think it ’ s very important for people to express their views on this bill to the senators , because there will be a vote next week .
You know , it is , of course—this bill , of course , is quite a bit meaner in some ways than the House bill . The cuts to Medicaid , for instance , are much deeper . And many people , like those in nursing homes and poor infants , are going to be affected worse . There ’ s going to be worse problems under this bill .
But I do want to just talk a little bit about how the taxes are—these big tax windfalls are going to come to the rich . What the Republican bill does is says that rich people who get their income from investments no longer have to pay the Medicare tax . People who earn in wages and salaries have to pay a 3 to 4 percent Medicare tax . But the Republican Senate and House bills will say that rich people earning $ 100 million a year off of investments , through stock sales and dividends , no longer have to pay that same Medicare tax that the rest of us pay . They ’ ve been very quiet about that , because I don ’ t think that ’ s a very popular idea . You know , additionally , they ’ re cutting taxes on the insurance industry , on Pharma , as if they needed more money . They ’ re cutting taxes on the medical device industry . So this is a giant tax cut , a very unpopular tax cut , if Americans really understood who was getting this tax windfall . And it ’ s going to make healthcare skimpier and more expensive for ordinary Americans .
AMY GOODMAN : Professor John McDonough , does this void Obamacare altogether , if this were passed ?
JOHN McDONOUGH : If it were passed in its current form , it would do unprecedented damage to that law , most of the major portions of it that deal with expanding coverage and providing some security for Americans in terms of needing healthcare services . There are other major parts of the law that it actually doesn ’ t touch at all . There ’ s a big part of the law that ’ s trying to do major changes in medical care delivery , creating new mechanisms called accountable care organizations , establishing a center for innovation at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services . None of those are touched , so there ’ s large parts of the law that , quietly , Republicans actually support and seem to want to continue and even expand . But the major pieces of the law , in terms of expanding insurance coverage for low- and lower-middle-income Americans and the taxes to pay for that , are pretty well decimated in terms of what ’ s on the table right now .
And this is going to move very fast . It ’ s possible that it won ’ t happen . And that ’ s why Steffie is so correct when she says everybody ’ s got to weigh in here . But if they succeed in getting it through the Senate on Thursday or Friday of next week , there are some reports that the House may actually convene on Saturday and adopt the Senate version and send it to the president ’ s desk . So this could move with unprecedented rapidity for such a major controversial issue . So the stakes are very high . And the place really where this needs to get stalled and defeated is next week in the Senate .
AMY GOODMAN : So are you saying that this actually could go to the House—instead of the House attempting to reconcile the Senate and House bills , they could just adopt the Senate bill ?
JOHN McDONOUGH : It is conceivable that , you know , if it gets through the Senate with 50 votes , that the Senate will say to the House , “ This is it , folks . Take it or leave it. ” And they will come on Saturday , and they may be able to string together enough votes so that they could actually just adopt the Senate plan in toto and send it directly to President Trump ’ s desk .
AMY GOODMAN : You were one of the architects of Romneycare in Massachusetts , right ?
AMY GOODMAN : Well , the Affordable Care Act very much based on a Republican plan , under a Republican governor of Massachusetts , Governor Romney , who would later , obviously , run for president . How far away are the Republicans today in Congress , in the House and the Senate , from that Republican plan in Massachusetts that did get passed ?
JOHN McDONOUGH : Well , there ’ s a—there ’ s a significant withdrawal . As we know , the individual mandate was a Republican conservative idea , going back to the 1980s . The '90s , that was their alternative to Bill Clinton 's universal coverage plan . And they continued to promote it throughout the process where we passed it in Massachusetts .

AMY GOODMAN: After weeks of secret deliberations, Republican senators Thursday released a healthcare bill that would reduce key benefits for millions of Americans. The Better Care Reconciliation Act would fund a large capital gains tax cut for the rich by removing millions of low-income and disabled people from Medicaid. According to the Center on Budget [and] Policy Priorities, $33 billion of the tax cuts would benefit the 400 wealthiest U.S. households. The Senate bill would also reduce subsidies to individuals to purchase health insurance, and would allow states to eliminate protections for people with pre-existing conditions. The measure would defund Planned Parenthood for a year, making breast cancer screenings and basic reproductive services more difficult for women to secure.

While drafting the legislation, President Trump had called on Republicans to improve the House plan by giving it more, quote, “heart.” The bill was negotiated behind closed doors between 13 Republican white male senators. This is Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.

SEN. MITCH McCONNELL: We agreed on the need to free Americans from Obamacare’s mandates. And policies contained in the discussion draft will repeal the individual mandate, so Americans are no longer forced to buy insurance they don’t need or can’t afford; will repeal the employer mandate, so Americans no longer see their hours and take-home pay cut by employers because of it.

AMY GOODMAN: Senator McConnell says he wants to vote on the healthcare bill next week, before Congress leaves for the Fourth of July recess. Republicans can only afford to lose two votes for the measure to pass with 50 votes. Four Republican senators—Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Ron Johnson and Mike Lee—said Thursday they’ll oppose the bill in its current form, arguing it fails to cut Medicaid benefits enough. The bill is similar to a House measure that would leave more than 20 million Americans without health insurance. The Congressional Budget Office has yet to score the Senate bill. Democrats are firmly united against the bill. This is Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.

SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER: This is a bill designed to strip away healthcare benefits and protections from Americans who need it most, in order to give a tax break to the folks who need it least. This is a bill that would end Medicaid as we know it, rolling back Medicaid expansion, cutting federal support for the program even more than the House bill, which cut Medicaid by $800 billion.

AMY GOODMAN: This comes as scores of disabled protesters held a sit-in outside Senator Mitch McConnell’s office on Capitol Hill Thursday and demonstrators gathered at Washington, D.C.’s National Airport to target Republican lawmakers as they left town for their home states.

Also on Thursday, Barack Obama weighed in on efforts to scale back his signature healthcare law. He posted a scathing statement on Facebook that said, quote, “The Senate bill, unveiled today, is not a health care bill. It’s a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America,” President Obama said.

For more, we host a roundtable discussion with three guests. Joining us from Boston, John McDonough, professor at Harvard Chan School of Public Health, served as a senior adviser on national health reform to the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions from 2008 to 2010. And from 2003 to '08, he served as executive director of Health Care for All in Massachusetts, playing a key role in passage of the 2006 Massachusetts health reform law. He's the author of Inside National Health Reform.

Also in Boston, Dr. Steffie Woolhandler joins us, a professor at CUNY-Hunter College and a primary care physician. She’s a lecturer at Harvard Medical School and the co-founder of Physicians for a National Health Program. She is a well-known national advocate for Medicare for all.

And in Aspen, Colorado, we’re joined by Dr. Willie Parker, physician, abortion provider, and board chair of Physicians for Reproductive Health. His new book, Life’s Work: A Moral Argument for Choice.

We welcome you all back to Democracy Now! Let’s begin with Professor McDonough. Can you lay out what the Republicans presented, after weeks of secret negotiations with other Republicans?

JOHN McDONOUGH: So, I think that the statements from Senator Schumer articulated it well. What is essentially going on here is the Affordable Care Act was an attempt to improve the nation’s healthcare system and expand coverage and deal with other issues. And it was paid for significantly by new taxes on wealthy Americans and some very powerful corporate interests. The new bill in the House, and reflected in the Senate, is an attempt to do major tax cuts for wealthy Americans and powerful corporate interests, financed by decimating the Medicaid program and other essential parts of the nation’s healthcare safety net. So, that is clearly what’s going on.

The Senate initially said, “We will take the House bill and throw it away and start all over.” Instead, what they’ve done is simply make a number of adjustments. If you look up close between the two, you can see many, many disagreements and differences of opinion on details, but if you stand back, they are essentially the same thing.

They fundamentally undermine the nation’s commitment to the Medicaid program, which covers about 75 million low-income and lower-income Americans by phasing out the expansion that was created in the Affordable Care Act and by fundamentally changing the financing of it, where they put a cap on it so that states will have no choice but begin to retrench back on the benefits. They continue the subsidies for private health insurance purchase for lower-middle-income Americans, but, again, they substantially degrade that coverage—for example, lowering the—what’s called the actuarial value, or how much benefit you get out of your premiums, from the ACA standard of 70 percent down to 58 percent, which means higher copays, higher deductibles, across the board. They defund Planned Parenthood for a year, but setting it up then to continue well into the future. They get rid of the Prevention and Public Health Trust Fund that has provided vital public health funds to the Centers for Disease Control as well as public health departments all over the country. You can go on and on. It’s hard to find something in the measure that one could say that’s good or at least not harmful. It’s pretty much bad from start to finish.

AMY GOODMAN: On the issue of Medicaid, we’re talking about Medicaid cut, overall, in half, something we haven’t seen in the history of Medicaid, both Medicaid expansion and Medicaid itself. And can you talk about who is covered by Medicaid? Like half the babies born in this country are paid for by Medicaid.

JOHN McDONOUGH: Yeah, so, Medicaid is the primary insurance coverage program for low- and lower-income Americans, many children, most children in the United States—more children under Medicaid than any other kind of coverage—their parents, poor senior citizens, low-income disabled people and other working low-income adults, who have no other options for coverage. About a third of the Medicaid program consists of low-income senior citizens and disabled. They actually account for two-thirds of the spending on the program. And so, if you want to take a meat ax, which is what they’re doing, to the Medicaid program, it is really impossible to implement cuts at that level without having damaging impacts on low-income, disabled and elderly, as well as children, parents and families.

AMY GOODMAN: Nursing homes?

JOHN McDONOUGH: Nursing homes is very much a part of the benefits that low-income seniors get. Very few families have had seniors, grandparents or parents, who have gone into long-term care and not at some point needed help from Medicaid to pay for the cost of long-term care, which is just so unaffordable for most Americans.

AMY GOODMAN: Dr. Steffie Woolhandler, presumably, you only saw this starting yesterday. This was kept under wraps from many Republicans, as well as Democrats, in the Senate. And it’s interesting, the Republicans who are opposed to this. You have the group, like Mike Lee from Utah and Rand Paul from Kentucky, Ron Johnson from Wisconsin, who don’t—who feel that this doesn’t go far enough. But then you also have Senator Susan Collins from Maine, as well as Senator Murkowski from Alaska, who are deeply concerned that this, well, once again, as with the House bill, that apparently President Trump has called “mean,” will mean tens of millions of more Americans will lose their health insurance.

DR. STEFFIE WOOLHANDLER: Well, it certainly will. I think it’s very important for people to express their views on this bill to the senators, because there will be a vote next week.

You know, it is, of course—this bill, of course, is quite a bit meaner in some ways than the House bill. The cuts to Medicaid, for instance, are much deeper. And many people, like those in nursing homes and poor infants, are going to be affected worse. There’s going to be worse problems under this bill.

But I do want to just talk a little bit about how the taxes are—these big tax windfalls are going to come to the rich. What the Republican bill does is says that rich people who get their income from investments no longer have to pay the Medicare tax. People who earn in wages and salaries have to pay a 3 to 4 percent Medicare tax. But the Republican Senate and House bills will say that rich people earning $100 million a year off of investments, through stock sales and dividends, no longer have to pay that same Medicare tax that the rest of us pay. They’ve been very quiet about that, because I don’t think that’s a very popular idea. You know, additionally, they’re cutting taxes on the insurance industry, on Pharma, as if they needed more money. They’re cutting taxes on the medical device industry. So this is a giant tax cut, a very unpopular tax cut, if Americans really understood who was getting this tax windfall. And it’s going to make healthcare skimpier and more expensive for ordinary Americans.

AMY GOODMAN: Professor John McDonough, does this void Obamacare altogether, if this were passed?

JOHN McDONOUGH: If it were passed in its current form, it would do unprecedented damage to that law, most of the major portions of it that deal with expanding coverage and providing some security for Americans in terms of needing healthcare services. There are other major parts of the law that it actually doesn’t touch at all. There’s a big part of the law that’s trying to do major changes in medical care delivery, creating new mechanisms called accountable care organizations, establishing a center for innovation at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. None of those are touched, so there’s large parts of the law that, quietly, Republicans actually support and seem to want to continue and even expand. But the major pieces of the law, in terms of expanding insurance coverage for low- and lower-middle-income Americans and the taxes to pay for that, are pretty well decimated in terms of what’s on the table right now.

And this is going to move very fast. It’s possible that it won’t happen. And that’s why Steffie is so correct when she says everybody’s got to weigh in here. But if they succeed in getting it through the Senate on Thursday or Friday of next week, there are some reports that the House may actually convene on Saturday and adopt the Senate version and send it to the president’s desk. So this could move with unprecedented rapidity for such a major controversial issue. So the stakes are very high. And the place really where this needs to get stalled and defeated is next week in the Senate.

AMY GOODMAN: So are you saying that this actually could go to the House—instead of the House attempting to reconcile the Senate and House bills, they could just adopt the Senate bill?

JOHN McDONOUGH: It is conceivable that, you know, if it gets through the Senate with 50 votes, that the Senate will say to the House, “This is it, folks. Take it or leave it.” And they will come on Saturday, and they may be able to string together enough votes so that they could actually just adopt the Senate plan in toto and send it directly to President Trump’s desk.

AMY GOODMAN: You were one of—

JOHN McDONOUGH: So, this could happen very fast.

AMY GOODMAN: You were one of the architects of Romneycare in Massachusetts, right?

JOHN McDONOUGH: We didn’t call it that.

AMY GOODMAN: Well, the Affordable Care Act very much based on a Republican plan, under a Republican governor of Massachusetts, Governor Romney, who would later, obviously, run for president. How far away are the Republicans today in Congress, in the House and the Senate, from that Republican plan in Massachusetts that did get passed?

JOHN McDONOUGH: Well, there’s a—there’s a significant withdrawal. As we know, the individual mandate was a Republican conservative idea, going back to the 1980s. The '90s, that was their alternative to Bill Clinton's universal coverage plan. And they continued to promote it throughout the process where we passed it in Massachusetts. And then, when it got to Congress in 2009 and it was Barack Obama who was supporting it, then they all jumped off the ship and left the Democrats there by ourselves to try to get as best done as it was possible to get done at that time. So, there’s been a substantial retrenchment.

And what’s left is—I saw, you know, this morning, on one of the TV shows, Senator Rand Paul basically saying, “Well, I think we should just take away all of the standards and requirements and let people buy whatever they want. And people should be able to buy health insurance,” he said, “for about a dollar a day”—so, about $365 a year. I don’t know what that would really get you, but it wouldn’t get you very much.

But I think that one has to understand is what motivates the Republican Party is cutting taxes. That’s first, and everything else is secondary to that goal, whether it’s healthcare, education, environmental protection—everything else. So this is part of a bigger pattern in terms of the Republican agenda. It’s just this is so big and important, this is up first. But this is not the end. This is just the beginning.

AMY GOODMAN: John McDonough, I know you have to leave. I want to thank you for being with us, professor at Harvard Chan School of Public Health. Dr. Steffie Woolhandler will stay with us. And we’ll be joined by Dr. Willie Parker, who’s chair of the board of Physicians for Reproductive Health. He is an abortion provider himself.

The GOP-crafted American Health Care Act made it through on a vote of 217 to 213 . It now heads to the Senate where it is expected to face fierce debate .
Although the measure will likely see changes once in the Senate , as it stands now , here are five things the bill does :
Eliminates Obamacare tax penalties for those who do n't buy coverage

The GOP-crafted American Health Care Act made it through on a vote of 217 to 213. It now heads to the Senate where it is expected to face fierce debate.

Although the measure will likely see changes once in the Senate, as it stands now, here are five things the bill does:

Blocks federal payments to Planned Parenthood for one year

Eliminates Obamacare tax penalties for those who don't buy coverage

Includes Medicaid cuts & allows state work requirements for Medicaid recipients

Changes Obamacare insurance subsidies into tax credits

Continues family policies that cover grown children until age 26

Many pro-life Republicans have praised the bill for blocking federal funding for Planned Parenthood.

""It's about time that Planned Parenthood start looking somewhere else for revenue rather than American taxpayers, who have no interest in funding abortion. House leadership should be commended for listening to their constituents and getting a bill passed that defunds Planned Parenthood, the nation's largest abortion vendor,"" said Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life.

Despite the victory of the measure in the House, as it heads to the Senate there are still many questions surrounding the bill. Cost is one concern. The Congressional Budget Office has not yet released an estimated cost for this version of the bill.

Another area of concern is pre-existing conditions. The bill allows states to get federal waivers that would free insurers from other Obamacare coverage requirements. With waivers, insurers could charge people with preexisting conditions higher rates than their peers and raise prices for older consumers.

A last-minute amendment to the measure includes $8 billion over five years to cover such conditions. That amendment helped secure enough votes to narrowly get the measure through the house.

House Republicans scrapped a vote on their health care replacement plan on Friday after defections from both the right and center that made it clear the bill would not pass.

""Obamacare is the law of the land. It is going to remain the law of the land,"" House Speaker Paul Ryan admitted shortly after he pulled the bill. ""We're going to be living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future. I don't know how long it's going to take us to replace this law.""

Ryan may have admitted defeat, but President Trump chalked it up to a ""learning experience."" Trump also tried to spin the setback as an opportunity for a potential ""bipartisan"" bill in the future.

""Both parties can get together ... and have a better bill,"" he said, adding, ""Having bipartisan would be a big, big improvement.""

But Trump and Ryan both said health care is being put on the shelf for the time being. They're moving on to tax reform.

The failure of the health care bill is a major setback for Trump's leadership and Ryan's ability to control his conference. That control was something that eluded his predecessor, John Boehner, and eventually led to Boehner's ouster.

""The best thing we can do politically speaking is let Obamacare explode,"" Trump argued in the Oval Office. ""It is exploding right now.""

Trump — who is the first president to enter office without any political or legislative experience — seemed to admit there was a bit of a learning curve.

He added, ""This is a setback — no two ways about it. ... I will not sugarcoat this — this is a disappointing day for us.""

The way forward for Republicans on exactly how to replace Obamacare remains murky. And it's not clear whether they will try again. Ryan had already delayed the bill a day to try to muster support. Trump had delivered an ultimatum to House Republicans — pass the GOP replacement, the American Health Care Act, or Obamacare will stand.

Ultimately, the votes never came together for a fractured GOP caucus, and Ryan traveled to the White House to tell Trump he was pulling the bill.

Democrats, meanwhile, were more than happy to take a victory lap in the GOP's defeat.

The inability of Republicans to reach consensus on a bill, given their control of the House, Senate and White House, badly hurts the GOP's image as a party that can govern, and Ryan admitted as much on Friday.

The GOP has vowed repeatedly over the past eight years that it would repeal and replace Obamacare. The legislative stalemate endangers Trump's and the GOP's agenda and casts a cloud over the legislative path forward after an election waged almost entirely as the antithesis to a progressive agenda enacted by former President Barack Obama, Trump's predecessor.

The risks were high for Trump on the bill. He has hyped a brand of someone able to strike the best deals. Being unable to get this through, after giving an ultimatum to congressional Republicans Thursday, raises questions about just how good a deal-maker he is and underscores his lack of legislative and policy experience upon entering the White House.

Vice President Pence, who canceled a trip out of Washington, had hoped to make one last sale in a meeting with the roughly 40-member, hard-line conservative Freedom Caucus, which had also refused to budge from its ideological objections to the bill.

In an attempt to win the caucus over, an amendment was added to the bill late Wednesday night, cutting essential health benefits, 10 types of medical care that insurance companies are required to cover.

A good CEO must work within the strengths and limitations of his organization -- then execute effectively to deliver on the promises he makes .
Enter the president ’ s signature program . He told the American people :
- If you can ’ t buy health insurance , the ACA will make it easy to obtain .
- If you like the insurance you have , the ACA will let you can keep it .
- If you like your doctor , the ACA will let you can keep him .
- If you already have good insurance , the ACA will make it cheaper .
The ACA website , HealthCare.gov , even with many efforts at improvement , is simply not easy to use or adequately effective .
As of November 30 , 365,000 Americans signed up for insurance via that website and the other exchanges set up by the states .
This is well short of the administration ’ s target , and makes unlikely that 7 million Americans will sign up by March 31 , as projected by the Department of Health and Human Services .
Many who have failed to participate are young and healthy , and it is their participation that is needed to make the insurance policies offered viable .
When new insurance policies take effect next year , many Americans who successfully navigated the federal website will find they have signed up for nothing at all .
Critical information about policyholders , dependents , incomes and the like has not been effectively transmitted to insurance companies for about one in ten applicants . And the software needed to pay insurance companies federal subsidies promised for low and moderate income Americans is not yet completed .
Doctors will be scrambling to collect money directly from patients , who may not have the ability to pay , and to keep their practices solvent .
Right out of the box , the ACA declared many individual and group insurance policies to be inadequate and illegal .
After a public uproar , the president declared those could be reinstated for one year , but many state insurance commissioners balked at this unworkable reversal of policy . Insurance companies simply can ’ t recreate the risk pools of customers that made those policies viable .
Once out , the jelly could not be put back into the jar .

Now the president lacks the trust and credibility to pursue important second term initiatives like immigration reform .","Thanks to the Affordable Care Act aka ""ObamaCare,"" President Obama has lost credibility as a leader and effective executive with most Americans.

A good CEO must work within the strengths and limitations of his organization -- then execute effectively to deliver on the promises he makes.

Enter the president’s signature program. He told the American people:

- If you can’t buy health insurance, the ACA will make it easy to obtain.

- If you like the insurance you have, the ACA will let you can keep it.

- If you like your doctor, the ACA will let you can keep him.

- If you already have good insurance, the ACA will make it cheaper.

The ACA website, HealthCare.gov, even with many efforts at improvement, is simply not easy to use or adequately effective.

As of November 30, 365,000 Americans signed up for insurance via that website and the other exchanges set up by the states.

This is well short of the administration’s target, and makes unlikely that 7 million Americans will sign up by March 31, as projected by the Department of Health and Human Services.

Many who have failed to participate are young and healthy, and it is their participation that is needed to make the insurance policies offered viable.

When new insurance policies take effect next year, many Americans who successfully navigated the federal website will find they have signed up for nothing at all.

Critical information about policyholders, dependents, incomes and the like has not been effectively transmitted to insurance companies for about one in ten applicants. And the software needed to pay insurance companies federal subsidies promised for low and moderate income Americans is not yet completed.

Insurance companies won’t have enough cash to pay claims.

Doctors will be scrambling to collect money directly from patients, who may not have the ability to pay, and to keep their practices solvent.

Right out of the box, the ACA declared many individual and group insurance policies to be inadequate and illegal.

After a public uproar, the president declared those could be reinstated for one year, but many state insurance commissioners balked at this unworkable reversal of policy. Insurance companies simply can’t recreate the risk pools of customers that made those policies viable.

Once out, the jelly could not be put back into the jar.

Across the full range of policies sold directly to individuals and provided groups through employers, insurance companies are eliminating doctors and hospitals from networks to meet arbitrary ObamaCare mandates.

Americans are scrambling to find new physicians, who are often overwhelmed and sometimes cannot provide essential services some patients need.

With just over a week left until the midterm elections, Americans deserve to know the truth: Republicans support policies that would make it harder to for sick people to get health insurance.

Trump’s position on preexisting conditions, explained

There are some policy debates where it’s difficult to figure out where different candidates stand. For example, I don’t know what every candidate really means when they say they support “Medicare-for-All.” The term is shorthand for a universal coverage system, but what that system looks like exactly can vary.

The debate over preexisting conditions isn’t like that. It is a debate where we have lots and lots of evidence of where Trump and others stand.

Hawley and the 19 other attorneys general could drop off that lawsuit at any moment. They could decide the threat to preexisting conditions is just too great. But nothing like that has happened.

The promises that candidates make on health care matter

I saw this firsthand two years ago, when I went to Kentucky to write a story about Obamacare enrollees who voted for Trump. I asked a lot of voters: Why did you support the candidate who campaigned on getting rid of your health insurance?

I heard the same answer again and again: He promised that something better would come along. The voters I met during that reporting trip had paid attention to the election. They knew that Trump wanted to repeal Obamacare. But they also listened to the promises that came after that — his repeated claims that he would come up with something better to replace it.

Americans are listening to the claims candidates make about health care. They are hearing Republicans claim that they want to protect preexisting conditions. And in some cases, they are probably believing those claims. Mostly because we don’t expect our representatives to lie so brazenly to us.

But everything I’ve seen covering the Obamacare repeal debate — from the bills on Capitol Hill to this new anti-ACA lawsuit — tells me that Republicans are not interested in protecting preexisting conditions. And voters should know that before casting their ballots.

healthcare,Politico,0,http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/04/cassidy-republicans-obamacare-divide-239099,Meet the GOP senator who wants to bridge the Obamacare divide,2017-06-04,"Burgess Everett, Paul Demko, Elana Schor, Jennifer Haberkorn","COVINGTON , La . — Sen. Bill Cassidy got cheers on late-night television for calling for an Obamacare replacement plan that would pass what he calls `` the Jimmy Kimmel test '' — that is , cover children like the comedian 's son recently born with a congenital heart defect .
But the first-term senator and physician is not seeing that support from his GOP colleagues .
“ He knows of what he speaks , ” said Sen. John Cornyn of Texas , the Senate ’ s No . 2 Republican . “ But we ’ ve got to find a way to get behind a consensus bill . ”
Cassidy is undeterred . To hear him tell it , he ’ s the one in Congress fighting to keep President Donald Trump ’ s promises to his base . On the campaign trail , Cassidy argues that Trump consistently promised a health care plan that would reduce premiums , eliminate mandates , ensure continuous coverage and protect people with pre-existing conditions . Any GOP plan , he says , needs to meet that bar .
“ I ’ ve been pretty out front and pretty bold and pretty national and pretty local , saying I want our bill to pass because our bill fulfills President Trump ’ s pledge to the voter , ” Cassidy told 220 people packed into a town hall outside New Orleans last week . “ Also , by the way , I think it is good public policy , and I think is good for the American people . ”
Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R-S.C. ) called Cassidy a “ real intellectual driver on our side ” and said it ’ s unlikely the Louisiana senator would simply fall in line at the end of the process and vote for whatever GOP leaders demand . Graham has co-sponsored Cassidy ’ s bill even though it stands little chance at this juncture .

“ I don ’ t think he ’ ll vote for a bill that he doesn ’ t believe in , ” Graham said .
Cassidy demurs when asked whether he would support a GOP plan that he feels doesn ’ t meet that Trump pledge .
“ I hesitate to answer that because I want to see ” the bill , he told ███ . “ I may feel like it crosses that bar and someone else may think not . ”
In many ways , Cassidy ’ s whole professional life has led up to this moment . A gastroenterologist who cared for uninsured Louisianans in the state ’ s charity hospital system , Cassidy stands out for his passionate advocacy for the people he once treated , even as he ran against Obamacare during his Senate campaign .
He was the first senator out of the gate to introduce an Obamacare replacement bill , with moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine , that would allow states to set up the health plan of their choice — including keeping Obamacare . To date , only five Republicans have signed onto a proposal that most other Republicans regard as too liberal and Democrats as too conservative .
But should Majority Leader Mitch McConnell be unable to corral 50 votes for a more narrowly partisan bill , Cassidy hopes his bill could become a bipartisan starting point .
“ There are parts of it I like , ” Sen. John Kennedy , Cassidy ’ s GOP colleague from Louisiana , said of his proposal . “ I don ’ t like the idea of allowing states to remain on Obamacare if Obamacare is failing . ”
Sen. Chris Murphy ( D-Conn. ) derided the Cassidy-Collins effort as “ window dressing ” for what will ultimately be an all-Republican bill written by a 13-person working group that excludes Cassidy .
Cassidy says he wasn ’ t offended by his exclusion from McConnell ’ s working group — and he ’ s attending the meetings anyway . As someone who probably has more firsthand experience with Medicaid than any other Republican senator , he says he is determined to influence the debate , even if he has to muscle his way in .
Certainly , he ’ s doing everything he can to keep his own proposals in the public eye . When Kimmel ’ s tearful plea for health coverage for children went viral last month , Cassidy called for any Obamacare repeal plan to pass the “ Jimmy Kimmel test ” — a quip that got him booked on the talk show and that he ’ s regularly taken to the Senate floor .
Formerly a low-profile and somewhat anonymous senator , Cassidy is now dogged by packs of reporters and offers candid takes on the CBO ’ s score for the House ’ s health care bill ( an “ eye-popper , ” he says ) . At one point , he rolled up his shirtsleeves and walked reporters through the intricacies of his health care plan on a whiteboard .
He also handed his fellow Republicans a seven-page handout showing the strong correlation between the states Trump won and the parts of the country most in need of health care and health insurance . He created a spreadsheet of how much money each state would lose if Obamacare ’ s Medicaid expansion funding were eliminated .
And he ’ s pushing Republicans to revamp the Medicaid program , now an entitlement , to a set payment for every enrollee — an idea he first proposed in 2013 .

Bill Cassidy got cheers on late-night television for calling for an Obamacare replacement plan that would pass what he calls ""the Jimmy Kimmel test"" — that is, cover children like the comedian's son recently born with a congenital heart defect.

But the first-term senator and physician is not seeing that support from his GOP colleagues.

“He knows of what he speaks,” said Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the Senate’s No. 2 Republican. “But we’ve got to find a way to get behind a consensus bill.”

Cassidy is undeterred. To hear him tell it, he’s the one in Congress fighting to keep President Donald Trump’s promises to his base. On the campaign trail, Cassidy argues that Trump consistently promised a health care plan that would reduce premiums, eliminate mandates, ensure continuous coverage and protect people with pre-existing conditions. Any GOP plan, he says, needs to meet that bar.

“I’ve been pretty out front and pretty bold and pretty national and pretty local, saying I want our bill to pass because our bill fulfills President Trump’s pledge to the voter,” Cassidy told 220 people packed into a town hall outside New Orleans last week. “Also, by the way, I think it is good public policy, and I think is good for the American people.”

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) called Cassidy a “real intellectual driver on our side” and said it’s unlikely the Louisiana senator would simply fall in line at the end of the process and vote for whatever GOP leaders demand. Graham has co-sponsored Cassidy’s bill even though it stands little chance at this juncture.

“I don’t think he’ll vote for a bill that he doesn’t believe in,” Graham said.

Cassidy demurs when asked whether he would support a GOP plan that he feels doesn’t meet that Trump pledge.

“I hesitate to answer that because I want to see” the bill, he told POLITICO. “I may feel like it crosses that bar and someone else may think not.”

In many ways, Cassidy’s whole professional life has led up to this moment. A gastroenterologist who cared for uninsured Louisianans in the state’s charity hospital system, Cassidy stands out for his passionate advocacy for the people he once treated, even as he ran against Obamacare during his Senate campaign.

He was the first senator out of the gate to introduce an Obamacare replacement bill, with moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, that would allow states to set up the health plan of their choice — including keeping Obamacare. To date, only five Republicans have signed onto a proposal that most other Republicans regard as too liberal and Democrats as too conservative.

But should Majority Leader Mitch McConnell be unable to corral 50 votes for a more narrowly partisan bill, Cassidy hopes his bill could become a bipartisan starting point.

“There are parts of it I like,” Sen. John Kennedy, Cassidy’s GOP colleague from Louisiana, said of his proposal. “I don’t like the idea of allowing states to remain on Obamacare if Obamacare is failing.”

Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) derided the Cassidy-Collins effort as “window dressing” for what will ultimately be an all-Republican bill written by a 13-person working group that excludes Cassidy.

Cassidy says he wasn’t offended by his exclusion from McConnell’s working group — and he’s attending the meetings anyway. As someone who probably has more firsthand experience with Medicaid than any other Republican senator, he says he is determined to influence the debate, even if he has to muscle his way in.

Certainly, he’s doing everything he can to keep his own proposals in the public eye. When Kimmel’s tearful plea for health coverage for children went viral last month, Cassidy called for any Obamacare repeal plan to pass the “Jimmy Kimmel test” — a quip that got him booked on the talk show and that he’s regularly taken to the Senate floor.

Formerly a low-profile and somewhat anonymous senator, Cassidy is now dogged by packs of reporters and offers candid takes on the CBO’s score for the House’s health care bill (an “eye-popper,” he says). At one point, he rolled up his shirtsleeves and walked reporters through the intricacies of his health care plan on a whiteboard.

He also handed his fellow Republicans a seven-page handout showing the strong correlation between the states Trump won and the parts of the country most in need of health care and health insurance. He created a spreadsheet of how much money each state would lose if Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion funding were eliminated.

And he’s pushing Republicans to revamp the Medicaid program, now an entitlement, to a set payment for every enrollee — an idea he first proposed in 2013.

He's also seeking to automatically enroll people in a health plan with a chance to opt out — a proposal some other Republicans say is too similar to the unpopular individual mandate.

Cassidy is not alone in advocating for a health care bill that would require Democratic cooperation, and several Republican senators have stated they are uncomfortable with using the budget reconciliation process to sweep away Obamacare on a party-line vote in an effort to avoid a Democratic filibuster. But Republicans say that they cannot pursue work with Democrats until their GOP-only efforts fail first.

“I don’t like that we’re doing this through reconciliation,” said Collins. “I understand why we are because we’ve had no cooperation from the other side of the aisle, but I just think that makes it extremely difficult to come up with a comprehensive approach.”

The fatal conceits of Obamacare are the absurd notions that the government can spend your money more wisely than you can and that bureaucrats are more capable than you are to make your own most intimate, personal decisions. The antithesis of government-centered Obamacare is what I simply call “Patientcare.” Patients should be at the center of our health care universe, not President Obama and not the government.

Nearly two decades ago when I started medical school, I realized that no matter what the politicians do, or what administrators or anyone else say, all that ultimately matters is the care I provide to my patients. Everything else is secondary. At every level of a health care system, a simple question should be asked: What is best for patients? Not what’s best for government or lawyers or even doctors, but patients.

Patient-centered health care — Patientcare — looks like this:

Tax fairness: Eliminate ill-conceived taxes that have the perverse effect of preventing Americans from acting responsibly and purchasing individual insurance. If your boss pays for your insurance — with money he would have otherwise paid directly to you — then he understandably wants a say about your medical treatment, your private behavior and even your weight. Tax fairness would allow patients to purchase their own insurance and keep their employers out of their private examination rooms.

Insurance portability: When health insurance is decoupled from employment — as is auto insurance — you no longer risk being stuck in a job you hate for medical reasons. Moreover, when patients have their own policies, the insurance companies are finally forced to listen to them. If they don’t treat you right, you can fire them and hire another — just like you can your auto-insurance company.

Medicare Advantage: Nothing is more cruel than making promises to patients that cannot be kept and, quite simply, Medicare is insolvent and cannot keep its promises. The U.S. government is already the world’s biggest denier of medical claims. Part of the solution: Give patients the freedom to voluntarily enroll in premium-assistance programs like Medicare Advantage, where they own their own policies, rather than being subject to the rationing whims of unaccountable bureaucrats.

Health savings accounts: HSAs put patients in the driver’s seat. They are incentivized to keep an eye on costs yet funds are still available if — and this is the key — the patient himself decides it’s necessary. Patients who avoid wasteful spending are rewarded by keeping the savings. Unlike government rationing, HSAs reduce spending without compromising health care results. As Dr. Ben Carson says, when a child is born, he should be given a birth certificate and a health savings account.

End government monopolies: This is simple. Competition provides patients with more options, lower costs and better services. Equally true: Monopolies kill competition. Each state has created its own insurance monopoly, or at least cartel, by larding up health insurance with mandates to cover whichever services are offered by those providers who can hire the best lobbyists. These mandates protect the insurance companies and doctors at the expense of millions of patients who can no longer afford the high-priced insurance. The same holds true with medical licensing that protects doctors from competition. Your state should open its borders and allow reciprocity for physicians and carriers licensed in other states to practice medicine and offer more products to compete for your business.

Eliminate frivolous lawsuits: Patients pay a hidden “lawsuit tax” embedded in every medical procedure, pill and product, and hundreds of billions of dollars are wasted on defensive medicine. Patients should be protected not just from harmful doctors, but also from harmful lawyers, who are enriched by our current lottery lawsuit system.

Help the needy: Obamacare unleashes the worst approach to those in need. It artificially hikes health care costs beyond their means and then provides welfare to families — even those earning up to $94,000 a year — that still won’t cover the new, higher rates. That’s a double disaster, since taxpayers who now have to pay for their own higher premiums also must cover the welfare, not only for the needy, but even for their affluent neighbors. This is a train with too many cabooses and not enough engines, which will come crashing down the hill. For far less, we could, for example, simply give cash to needy families so they can purchase their own market-based insurance.

These are common-sense reform measures and, unlike Obamacare, they remain true to one guiding principle: Put patients first.

The president’s health care leviathan is already showing signs of collapse under its own weight. The Obamacare lies of universal coverage, cost savings and deficit reduction have been exposed, and even one of its own architects now admits that the law is “beyond comprehension” and predicts a “huge train wreck” that, after its bad start, “will just simply get worse.” Indeed.

It’s time to prepare for the post-Obamacare era. It’s time to build a system that finally puts patients first. It’s time for Patientcare.

Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, said “almost no one” would pay the federal penalty.

“The Congressional Budget Office estimates that only 1.4 percent of Americans will pay anything for refusing to purchase insurance,” Mr. Levin said. “That is just about identical to the percent of people in Massachusetts who have paid the penalty under Governor Romney’s health care law.”

Contrary to Republican claims, Mr. Levin said the federal law should be viewed as a tax cut for middle-income people because it would provide tax credits to help them pay premiums for private health insurance.

Mr. Romney, the Republicans’ likely presidential nominee, says he would take immediate action to roll back the federal law if he wins the White House.

Representative Charles B. Rangel, a New York Democrat and strong supporter of the 2010 law, said members of his party had made “a lot of mistakes” in selling its benefits to the public. Faced with unrelenting Republican opposition, he said, “the administration has not made the case that uninsured people get health care” under the law.

The Supreme Court rejected claims that the individual mandate was justified by Congress’s power to regulate interstate commerce, but upheld it as a permissible exercise of taxing power. Republicans said imposing a mandate by the tax power was scarier than using the commerce power. And they said it set a precedent for taxing “inactivity.”

“How is this different from the government requiring Americans to purchase broccoli or pay a tax for not doing so?” asked Representative Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.

Representative Daniel Lipinski, Democrat of Illinois, was a lonely voice pleading for a middle way. “We need a fix, not a repeal,” he said, asserting that Congress should keep “good parts of the law” and add stronger cost controls.",www.nytimes.com,left,KlZUo5XF61Haay7z

The Trump administration's decision to abandon the Affordable Care Act in an ongoing court challenge could affect some of the most popular pillars of the law — further intensifying the fight over health care in the middle of an election year.

The latest vote comes two weeks after the Supreme Court upheld the law as constitutional. None of the previous votes have resulted in Senate action, and President Barack Obama would veto any attempt to roll back his signature domestic achievement.

According to the numbers released Monday by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , only 24 percent – or 489,460 – of the 2.2 million people who signed up for ACA were in the coveted 18-to-34 age range . That means the government has hit only 18 percent of its stated goal of registering 2.7 million adults in the 18-to-34 age range .
Experts have predicted that the program will need roughly 40 percent of enrollees to be in that prime demographic in order to be fiscally solvent . Adults ages 55 to 64 made up 33 percent of the total number of Americans who signed up , the largest group represented in the data .
ObamaCare needs so-called 'invincibles ' -- healthy young adults -- to sign up in coming months to help offset the costs of older and less healthy enrollees . If that doesn ’ t happen , insurers could be forced to raise the rates , making the costs and future of ObamaCare uncertain .
`` This is concerning to us that we 're seeing this portion come in so old , '' Marty Anderson , marketing director for Wisconsin-based Security Health Plan , told the Wall Street Journal .
Allan Einboden , chief executive of Scott & White Health Plan , told the Journal that the data was `` more negative than we thought it was going to be , '' and added that several requests to pre-authorize surgeries for enrollees in the first days of their coverage had executives worried about costs .
Robert Laszewski , a consultant who works with insurers , told The New York Times that `` You need healthy people of all ages ... the program is not ramping up fast enough to guarantee a good balance of healthy and sick people , which you need to sustain the program . ''
Administration officials , though , were upbeat in describing the numbers Monday . They said they 're in a `` solid place , '' and noted that this age group makes up just 26 percent of the general population .
Monday ’ s report was the first time the government has released demographic data on the performance of President Obama ’ s signature health care overhaul . In all , about 1.8 million people enrolled in new individual health plans through the law in December , bringing the total number of new enrollments between Oct. 1 and Dec.28 to about 2.2 million .
`` There 's no way to spin it : youth enrollment has been a bust so far , '' Brendan Buck , a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner , said in a statement following the release . `` When they see that ObamaCare offers high costs for limited access to doctors – if the enrollment goes through at all – it 's no surprise that young people are n't rushing to sign up . ''
As analysts have told ███ , insurance companies have said they may want to take advantage of the `` risk pool '' provisions -- which involve the federal government covering 80 percent of any losses associated with an older and unhealthier base of customers .
According to HHS , 79 percent of ObamaCare customers selected a plan with financial assistance . While only 2.2 million people have actually signed up , 44.5 million called or visited state and federal websites .
Of the 2.2 million who have signed up , 54 percent are female and 46 percent are male , HHS said .
Individuals and families are able to choose from four plans offered through the federal marketplace -- bronze , silver , gold and platinum .
Sixty percent selected a silver plan , while 20 percent selected a bronze plan , according to HHS .","Insurers have raised concerns that too few young people are signing up for heath insurance through the ObamaCare exchanges after newly released statistics showed that less than a quarter of people who have enrolled are between the ages of 18 and 34.

According to HHS, 79 percent of ObamaCare customers selected a plan with financial assistance. While only 2.2 million people have actually signed up, 44.5 million called or visited state and federal websites.

Of the 2.2 million who have signed up, 54 percent are female and 46 percent are male, HHS said.

Individuals and families are able to choose from four plans offered through the federal marketplace -- bronze, silver, gold and platinum.

Sixty percent selected a silver plan, while 20 percent selected a bronze plan, according to HHS.",www.foxnews.com,right,1OMueJwwQsnFUkee

healthcare,The Hill,1,http://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/352760-congress-could-improve-health-care-by-reforming-the-false-claims-act,OPINION: Congress could improve health care by reforming the False Claims Act,2017-09-28,,"In a new Independence Institute working paper on the use and misuse of the False Claims Act ( FCA ) , attorneys Mark W. Pearlstein and Laura McLane explain how an 1863 statute written to expose and punish Civil War contractors who billed for gunpowder and supplied kegs full of sawdust raises costs and threatens access to medical care .
The FCA authorizes private individuals to sue anyone they think is defrauding the federal government . Individuals filed more than 4,700 FCA actions between 2009 and June 2016 . Awards range from $ 11,000 to $ 22,000 for each fraud detected , and the Act provides for treble damages . The spoils are divided among the person alleging the fraud , his attorneys , and the federal government . If the standard business practices of large firms come under fire , spoils can reach hundreds of millions of dollars . In 2014 , the Department of Justice reported that FCA “ recoveries ” totaled $ 5.79 billion . Health care lawsuits accounted for $ 2.3 billion of that .
The federal government must investigate the claims in every FCA case . The initial investigation is done under seal . Defendants may be investigated for years , but not know about it until their business documents are subpoenaed . The individual alleging fraud can proceed with a case even if the government decides against it .
Increasingly sophisticated groups of attorneys choose to continue . They sue any entity that receives federal payments , claiming that any failure to comply with complex administrative standards constitutes fraud . At the time the act was passed , the goal was to prosecute fraud cases in which a contractor billed the United States for nonexistent or worthless goods , not prosecute contractors for failing to adhere to specific manufacturing standards or minor differences of opinion .
Rather than working with contractors to improve their performance , the FCA is used as a blunt instrument to extract large sums from their business operations . The FCA has been used to sue nursing homes , hospitals , doctors , insurers , clinical laboratories , pharmaceutical manufacturers , software providers , managed care organizations , and universities funded by federal grants .
Plaintiffs allege too little care , too much care , billing errors , record-keeping violations , and differences in opinion about medical necessity .
The Department of Health and Human Services certifies provider performance using various methods .

Linda Gorman is director of the Health Care Policy Center at the Independence Institute ( @ i2idotorg ) , a free market think tank in Denver .","In a new Independence Institute working paper on the use and misuse of the False Claims Act (FCA), attorneys Mark W. Pearlstein and Laura McLane explain how an 1863 statute written to expose and punish Civil War contractors who billed for gunpowder and supplied kegs full of sawdust raises costs and threatens access to medical care.

The FCA authorizes private individuals to sue anyone they think is defrauding the federal government. Individuals filed more than 4,700 FCA actions between 2009 and June 2016. Awards range from $11,000 to $22,000 for each fraud detected, and the Act provides for treble damages. The spoils are divided among the person alleging the fraud, his attorneys, and the federal government. If the standard business practices of large firms come under fire, spoils can reach hundreds of millions of dollars. In 2014, the Department of Justice reported that FCA “recoveries” totaled $5.79 billion. Health care lawsuits accounted for $2.3 billion of that.

The federal government must investigate the claims in every FCA case. The initial investigation is done under seal. Defendants may be investigated for years, but not know about it until their business documents are subpoenaed. The individual alleging fraud can proceed with a case even if the government decides against it.

Increasingly sophisticated groups of attorneys choose to continue. They sue any entity that receives federal payments, claiming that any failure to comply with complex administrative standards constitutes fraud. At the time the act was passed, the goal was to prosecute fraud cases in which a contractor billed the United States for nonexistent or worthless goods, not prosecute contractors for failing to adhere to specific manufacturing standards or minor differences of opinion.

Rather than working with contractors to improve their performance, the FCA is used as a blunt instrument to extract large sums from their business operations. The FCA has been used to sue nursing homes, hospitals, doctors, insurers, clinical laboratories, pharmaceutical manufacturers, software providers, managed care organizations, and universities funded by federal grants.

Plaintiffs allege too little care, too much care, billing errors, record-keeping violations, and differences in opinion about medical necessity.

The Department of Health and Human Services certifies provider performance using various methods. It has numerous administrative enforcement tools to influence the behavior of contractors in substantial but not complete compliance with its regulations. It seeks to work with contractors to improve their performance rather than penalizing them with huge fines that divert large sums of money from patient care, or simply shutting down facilities that are not in perfect compliance.

In 2015, the Fourth Circuit upheld a $237 million FCA verdict in United States ex rel. Drakeford v. Tuomey.

After 10 years of litigation, Tuomey settled with the federal government. The government’s terms were $72.4 million and the requirement that Tuomey sell itself to another health system. Many FCA defendants settle because they cannot afford to prove their innocence. The government often requires signing a Corporate Integrity Agreement as part of the settlement terms, giving it control of the defendant’s business activities for many years.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates the AHCA will lead 24 million more Americans to go uninsured , push millions more into the kind of super-high-deductible care Republicans criticized in the Affordable Care Act , and all that will happen while the richest Americans get hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts . Voters — including the downscale rural whites who propelled Donald Trump into the presidency — aren ’ t going to like any of that . Virtually every health policy analyst from every side of the aisle thinks the AHCA is poorly constructed and will lead to consequences even its drafters didn ’ t intend . Avik Roy argues there are huge implicit tax increases for the poor who get jobs that lift them out of Medicaid ’ s ranks . Bob Laszewski thinks the plan will drive healthy people out of the insurance markets , creating even worse premium increases than we ’ re seeing under Obamacare .

As written , the AHCA is unlikely to pass the House , and so GOP leadership needs to give House conservatives more reasons to vote for the bill , even if those reasons leave the legislation less likely to succeed in the Senate .

Of the three problems in the AHCA , the third is by far the least serious — but it ’ s the only one the manager ’ s amendment even attempts to solve . These aren ’ t changes that address the core problems the GOP health care bill will create for voters , insurers , or states ; instead , it ’ s legislation that tries to solve some of the problems the bill creates for conservative legislators .

The major changes to the bill , which were first reported Politico and which ███ has now confirmed , are :
A change in the tax deductibility of medical expenses that the Senate could harness to boost tax credits for older Americans , to the tune of an estimated $ 85 billion
More flexibility for states to add work requirements to Medicaid
More flexibility for states to take their Medicaid funding as a lump-sum block grant rather than a per-person check
Accelerating the repeal of Obamacare ’ s tax increases by one year
Restricting people from rolling unused tax credit money into health savings accounts ( apparently to ease concerns of anti-abortion groups )
Changing Medicaid reimbursement procedures in a way that advantages county governments over state governments ( for idiosyncratic reasons , Republicans from New York are high on this provision )
States that haven ’ t accepted Obamacare ’ s Medicaid expansion will no longer have the opportunity to do so .
None of these provisions meaningfully change the underlying legislation , nor any of its flaws . These are mostly tweaks meant to win over hardcore conservatives and Congress members from New York .

What do Republicans think will happen if they actually pass this into law ?
I keep thinking about something that New York Times columnist Ross Douthat wrote today . “ Republican politicians may offer pandering promises of lower deductibles and co-pays , but the coherent conservative position is that cheaper plans with higher deductibles are a very good thing , ” he said . It ’ s a gently written sentence , but it ’ s damning beyond measure .
Republicans have been promising the literal opposite of the bill they are trying to pass . Trump swore he ’ d oppose Medicaid cuts — but this law has more than $ 800 billion of them . He said everyone would be covered — but the CBO estimates this bill will push up the ranks of the uninsured by 24 million people . Republicans everywhere said they would replace Obamacare with a plan that ensured more competition , lower premiums and deductibles , and an end to skyrocketing annual increases — but this bill will have the opposite effect for most of those affected .
So what happens when voters realize their new tax credit doesn ’ t cover anything close to the insurance they had ? What happens when they find themselves with fewer choices , paying much higher premiums after their smaller subsidies , and being told by insurers that costs are doubling because Republicans changed how much more the old could be charged than the young ?
Voters will notice all this . And what are Republicans going to say then ? That it ’ s all Barack Obama ’ s fault ? That high deductibles are actually good , they just forgot to mention it ? That they needed something they could pass quickly so they could move on to tax reform ?
This bill has always seemed like an answer to the question , “ What can we pass that would count as repealing and replacing Obamacare ? ” But that ’ s not the right question . The right question is , “ What can we pass that will actually make people ’ s lives better ? ” Given the truncated , fearful process Republicans have retreated behind , I ’ m not persuaded even they believe this bill is the answer .","There are three problems you could have imagined the manager’s amendment to the American Health Care Act trying to fix:

What changes are Republicans making to the AHCA?

The major changes to the bill, which were first reported Politico and which Vox has now confirmed, are:

A change in the tax deductibility of medical expenses that the Senate could harness to boost tax credits for older Americans, to the tune of an estimated $85 billion

More flexibility for states to add work requirements to Medicaid

More flexibility for states to take their Medicaid funding as a lump-sum block grant rather than a per-person check

Changing Medicaid reimbursement procedures in a way that advantages county governments over state governments (for idiosyncratic reasons, Republicans from New York are high on this provision)

Changing Medicaid reimbursement rates for the elderly and disabled

States that haven’t accepted Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion will no longer have the opportunity to do so.

None of these provisions meaningfully change the underlying legislation, nor any of its flaws. These are mostly tweaks meant to win over hardcore conservatives and Congress members from New York.

Will these changes push the bill through the House?

The locus of effective opposition to the American Health Care Act has been the House Freedom Caucus. Monday night, its leader, Rep. Mark Meadows, sounded a pessimistic note.

— From a Republican National Committee memo issued Thursday.

FROM THE ‘HEH’ DESK

Meanwhile, there’s a cultural moment. As far as the Obamacare goes, Americans trust information from Fox News more than President Obama. No, really. A new poll from YouGov finds that Fox News leads the list of most-trusted sources for health care news, followed by “friends and family,” Mr. Obama, National Public Radio, “your personal insurance company,” local TV news and, wonder of wonders — “Republicans in Congress.”

THE RETURN OF THE HE-MAN

Stand clear, now. Here comes “Mansfield’s Book of Manly Men: An Utterly Invigorating Guide to being Your Most Masculine Self,” by one Stephen Mansfield. Due from publisher Thomas Nelson on Tuesday, the book has received accolades from none other than Lt. Gen. William G. Boykin, the former commander of Delta Force.

“The Western world is in a crisis of discarded honor, dubious integrity, and faux manliness. It is time to recover what we have lost,” Mr. Mansfield proclaims. He also wrote “The Faith of George W. Bush” and “Lincoln’s Battle with God” among other books.

“My goal in this book is simple. I want to identify what a genuine man does — the virtues, the habits, the disciplines, the duties, the actions of true manhood — and then call men to do it,” the author adds.

He is weary of man-bashing culture like demeaning commercials and sitcoms, and he seeks to school younger gents in authentic manliness, lest they become isolated, by emphasizing “more doing, less talking.”

The thoughtful Mr. Mansfield also has supplied a list of 10 essential movies for manly men. They are: “Seabiscuit,” “Chariots of Fire,” “The Pursuit of Happy-ness,” “It’s a Wonderful Life,” “Dead Poets Society,” “Apollo 13,” “The King’s Speech,” “Men of Honor,” “Hoosiers” and “The Last Samurai.”

Bernie Sanders, like many American progressives, is almost completely parochial.

Senator Bernie Sanders, gamely making the case for socialism on CNN, offers a familiar argument: that access to health care and other goods like it should be understood as a “right.”

Properly understood, that claim is literally nonsensical, having the grammatical form of a sentence but no meaningful content, inasmuch as it is logically meaningless to declare a right in a scarce good. (I am using scarce here in its economic sense rather than in its common conversational sense.) For example: If you have twelve children and six cupcakes, the possibilities of division remain the same even if you declare that every child has the “right” to an entire cupcake of his own. Goods are physical, while rights are metaphysical, and the actual facts of the real world are not transformed by our deciding to talk about them in a different way. Other declarations in the same form — “Health care is quintessentially axiomatic,” “Health care is candy-apple gray,” “Health care is a spastically cloistered bottle of courageous smoke,” etc. — would be equally meaningless as sentences.

“Health care is a right” is a sentence that fools some people into thinking that it means something because the synthetic impression of moral urgency that accompanies the declaration of “a right” overwhelms the ordinary logical faculty, which in many people is less developed than the emotional endowment, that widespread condition being the principal defect in democracy. When a politician declares a “right” in a scarce good, it indicates either that he is a simpleton or that he believes you to be, and one’s as good as the other, that being another defect in democracy.

(Another defect in democracy is its apparently inability to learn, hence the Democratic embrace of socialism in 2019 in spite of socialism’s unbroken track record of failure and brutality.)

In the Heritage Foundation’s economic-liberty rankings, the Scandinavian countries come in right alongside the United States — and behind such market-oriented leaders as Switzerland, Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore. On many scores, the Scandinavian countries offer more robust free-market systems than does the United States.

Another thing the Scandinavian countries have in common: Their politicians may talk about health care as a right sometimes, too, but in none of those countries is health care free.

There isn’t a single “Scandinavian” model of health care, but there are some features common in the set. One of them is that consumers pay out of pocket for health care, starting with copays but also extending to many specialist services, prescription drugs, dental care, and the like. In fact, as the Commonwealth Fund runs the numbers, private out-of-pocket spending on health care is proportionally higher in Sweden (about 16 percent of all health-care spending) than in the United States (about 11 percent). Out-of-pocket spending as a share of health-care costs is higher in Denmark (12 percent) and Norway (14 percent), too. (Statistical note: There is a small difference between private spending and out-of-pocket spending, but it is trivial in the Scandinavian cases cited here, with out-of-pocket spending accounting for 98 percent or so of private spending. Also, those figures are complicated by the fact that spending levels are different from country to country, and that the United States is an outlier; the Swedes spend more out-of-pocket as a share of a lower spending total, meaning that their out-of-pocket expenses are higher than U.S. rates as a share of medical costs but lower in absolute terms.) In other countries with widely admired health-care systems, out-of-pocket spending is even higher as a share of health-care costs: around 19 percent in Switzerland and 60 percent in Singapore.

Those numbers in some ways say both more and less than it may seem, in that the U.S. employer-based health-insurance system plays a role similar to the social-insurance programs some other countries (it does not perform that role especially well), and a dollar taken out of your paycheck for health-care coverage is a dollar gone whether we call it a tax or an insurance premium. It is a peculiarity of the American system that we attempt to deputize employers to administer what is in many other countries part of the welfare state. As it stands, the U.S. system retains much of what people dislike about private care while incorporating much of what’s undesirable about state-dominated systems: insecurity and relatively high costs plus sclerotic bureaucracy and cumbrous regulation — hooray for us.

Not a right, but a duty.

For the first time in Gallup trends since 2000 , a majority of Americans say it is not the federal government 's responsibility to make sure all Americans have healthcare coverage . Prior to 2009 , a majority always felt the government should ensure healthcare coverage for all , though Americans ' views have become more divided in recent years ... Republicans , including Republican-leaning independents , are mostly responsible for the drop since 2007 in Americans ' support for government ensuring universal health coverage . In 2007 , 38 % of Republicans thought the government should do so ; now , 12 % do . Among Democrats and Democratic leaners there has been a much smaller drop , from 81 % saying the government should make sure all Americans are covered in 2007 to 71 % now .
Americans also remain overwhelmingly opposed to the imposition of a government-run , single-payer healthcare system , which very much remains leftists ' endgame :
One thing that has not changed is that Americans still widely prefer a system based on private insurance to one run by the government . Currently , 57 % prefer a private system and 36 % a government-run system , essentially the same as in 2010 and 2011 . Prior to the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 , the percentage of Americans in favor of a government-run system ranged from 32 % to 41 % .
A few final notes : ( 1 ) Though Gallup 's final likely voter poll prior to the election was off by four points , their registered voters numbers were pretty much spot on . In other words , their LV screen was too restrictive , but their overall data was sound . ( 2 ) Despite a heavily Democratic electorate on election day , a substantial plurality still supported Obamacare repeal , a result that mirrors stable polling trends . ( 3 ) For an idea of what a mind-blowing cluster Obamacare has already become , read this piece by Mary Katharine Ham . Deadlines keep getting pushed farther and farther back , and the administration has finally issued coverage rules for the state exchanges that are supposed to be up and running in a matter of months . These rules took 32 months to produce .

In 2007, 38% of Republicans thought the government should do so; now, 12% do. Among Democrats and Democratic leaners there has been a much smaller drop, from 81% saying the government should make sure all Americans are covered in 2007 to 71% now.



A look at the trendlines:



Americans also remain overwhelmingly opposed to the imposition of a government-run, single-payer healthcare system, which very much remains leftists' endgame:



One thing that has not changed is that Americans still widely prefer a system based on private insurance to one run by the government. Currently, 57% prefer a private system and 36% a government-run system, essentially the same as in 2010 and 2011. Prior to the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, the percentage of Americans in favor of a government-run system ranged from 32% to 41%.



A few final notes: (1) Though Gallup's final likely voter poll prior to the election was off by four points, their registered voters numbers were pretty much spot on. In other words, their LV screen was too restrictive, but their overall data was sound. (2) Despite a heavily Democratic electorate on election day, a substantial plurality still supported Obamacare repeal, a result that mirrors stable polling trends. (3) For an idea of what a mind-blowing cluster Obamacare has already become, read this piece by Mary Katharine Ham. Deadlines keep getting pushed farther and farther back, and the administration has finally issued coverage rules for the state exchanges that are supposed to be up and running in a matter of months. These rules took 32 months to produce. An unmitigated mess.",www.townhall.com,right,b53A470lVrXfQHhd

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — A federal judge on Monday put a nationwide hold on Trump administration rules that allow more employers to opt out of providing women with no-cost birth control.

U.S. District Judge Wendy Beetlestone in Philadelphia agreed with a lawsuit originally filed by Pennsylvania, citing the potential harm to states should the rules be enforced.

“Congress hasn’t changed that law, and the president can’t simply ignore it with an illegal rule,” Shapiro said.

New Jersey later joined Pennsylvania in suing.

But what if, by some miracle, liberal Democrats won comprehensive victories that created a window of opportunity in which single-payer becomes realistically possible?

Designing a single-payer system in America

Imagine what would happen were President Bernie Sanders to sweep into office backed by a Democratic congressional majority similar to what President Obama enjoyed in 2008. Imagine further that President Sanders were sufficiently fortunate and skilled after that victory to enact a single-payer system. I wonder how different our policy dilemmas would really be from what we now face in implementing the Affordable Care Act.

Single-payer would immediately raise myriad intricate and divisive transition issues. It would potentially uproot thousands of critical arrangements President Obama, Speaker Pelosi, and Sen. Reid struggled to leave intact.

After all, ACA’s sales pitch to the healthy and insured was, ""If you like your insurance, you can keep it."" This pledge proved politically damaging when it could not be fully kept for several million people. Single-payer would be far more disruptive to even more people.

Winners and losers in the single-payer system

It’s telling that no fully articulated single-payer bill was ever drafted as an alternative to the ACA. Such a bill would have been no less complicated, and would probably have been more encyclopedic than the ACA was. A huge reform that creates millions of winners creates millions of losers, too.

As with ACA, the biggest winners would be relatively disorganized low-income people in greatest need of help. The potential losers would include some of the most powerful and organized constituencies in America: workers who now receive generous tax expenditures for good private coverage, and affluent people who would face large tax increases to finance a single-payer system. At least some of these constituencies would need to be accommodated in messy political bargaining to get single-payer enacted. And states would have a role to play, too, potentially replicating the messy patchwork we got with ACA reforms.

Single-payer would require a serious rewrite of state and federal relations in Medicaid and in many other matters. It would radically revise the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), which strongly influences the benefit practices of large employers. Single-payer would require intricate negotiation to navigate the transition from employer-based coverage. The House and Senate would be in charge of this tension, and at risk of the negotiations among key legislators and committees who hold sway.

How even the public option died

Single-payer would be openly or quietly opposed by virtually the entire supply side of the medical economy. We saw this dynamic during the political knife fight over ACA’s ""public option."" Early versions of the public option would have allowed consumers shopping in the state marketplaces to buy into some public insurance modeled on Medicare.

Many stakeholders who supported other aspects of ACA noisily or quietly wanted to see the public option dead. Community hospitals, medical groups, pharmaceutical and medical device companies feared precisely the outcome liberals hoped to see: a viable public insurance product that gained broad acceptance and market share, and that used Medicare’s tremendous market power to discipline providers.

These constituencies understood and dreaded the heavy hand of government across from them at the bargaining table. These constituencies helped to kill the public option. They would be a force to be reckoned with in any political process that seeks to implement a single-payer system.

What the Supreme Court might do in a single-payer world

Given our polarized judiciary, there would be legal and constitutional challenges, too. Whatever fine print of the ACA found its way to the Supreme Court, the real fight concerned the propriety of an expansive federal government that seeks to regulate and humanize a national health care market. Constitutional conservatives reject this vision of American government. A single-payer system would engage even more contentious issues of federalism and the reach of national government.

Some progressives hope that single-payer could provide an attractive replacement for the grubby, path-dependent logrolling that now dominates our $3 trillion health care political economy. No viable single-payer program will replace these grubby politics. That’s logically impossible, because such a program must be produced through that very same process. Barring a historically comprehensive defeat of Republicans at every level of American government, advocates for expanded health coverage will face this discomfiting reality.

Passing a single-payer plan requires precisely the same interest group bargaining and logrolling required to pass the ACA. The resulting policies will thus replicate some of the very same scars, defects, and kludge that bedevil the ACA.

Progressives should still push for basic reforms that improve our current system. I supported the public option in 2009. I still do. I hope it resurfaces in some form, particularly for older participants in the state marketplaces. It may open a pathway to a true single-payer. If it doesn’t — which I suspect it will not — it might still provide a valuable alternative and source of pricing discipline within our pathological health care market.

Whatever policy one supports, we must actually consider how this imperfect and messy process will actually play out. There’s no immaculate conception in American politics.",www.vox.com,left,xJTuyfluDRcYgOZ4

The early hiccups with the federal health exchange website have largely been solved , too , and predictions of a dreaded insurance `` death spiral '' now seem wildly off .
Not a bad turnaround for a law that seemed broken back in October .
Yet for all the positive ObamaCare news that 's come out in the past month or so , a new tracking poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation finds that , among the uninsured , ObamaCare has actually grown less popular since December . Only 24 percent of the uninsured have a favorable impression of the law , while nearly twice as many , 47 percent , say the opposite . That 's a sizable shift from one month ago , when the popularity split was 36/46 .
Certainly , there 's a ton of volatility in Kaiser 's survey , so the latest numbers could be statistical noise . But the overall trend — the uninsured souring on the law — is quite clear , and supported by other recent surveys .
ObamaCare is supposed to most benefit the uninsured . So why is that crucial group turning against the law ?
For one , it 's possible that since they 're more directly impacted by the law , they 're more familiar with its warts . The federal exchange website was notoriously glitchy in the early going , and overall public perception of the law quickly turned south . That trend was most pronounced among the uninsured , with large majorities of those who visited Healthcare.gov reporting a dismal user experience .
With the site ( mostly ) repaired , that sentiment could change if the uninsured give the site a second crack and discover a smoother experience .

ObamaCare enrollments are finally taking off, passing the 3 million mark earlier this month. The early hiccups with the federal health exchange website have largely been solved, too, and predictions of a dreaded insurance ""death spiral"" now seem wildly off.

Not a bad turnaround for a law that seemed broken back in October.

Yet for all the positive ObamaCare news that's come out in the past month or so, a new tracking poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation finds that, among the uninsured, ObamaCare has actually grown less popular since December. Only 24 percent of the uninsured have a favorable impression of the law, while nearly twice as many, 47 percent, say the opposite. That's a sizable shift from one month ago, when the popularity split was 36/46.

Certainly, there's a ton of volatility in Kaiser's survey, so the latest numbers could be statistical noise. But the overall trend — the uninsured souring on the law — is quite clear, and supported by other recent surveys.

ObamaCare is supposed to most benefit the uninsured. So why is that crucial group turning against the law?

For one, it's possible that since they're more directly impacted by the law, they're more familiar with its warts. The federal exchange website was notoriously glitchy in the early going, and overall public perception of the law quickly turned south. That trend was most pronounced among the uninsured, with large majorities of those who visited Healthcare.gov reporting a dismal user experience.

With the site (mostly) repaired, that sentiment could change if the uninsured give the site a second crack and discover a smoother experience.

There's likely also a fiscal element underlying the downward trend. A December CBS News/New York Times survey, for instance, found that almost six in 10 uninsured thought the health-care law would hurt them financially.

Indeed, that could be true for many of the uninsured. In essence, the law is requiring them to either purchase something or pay a penalty for not doing so. With the individual mandate's deadline drawing closer, it's possible that the uninsured are beginning to feel that financial pinch.

Furthermore, some 8 million people are caught in a health-care limbo, too poor to obtain federal subsidies, but unable to tap the law's vast Medicaid expansion since their states aren't participating in it. Twenty-four states, most with GOP governors, declined the Medicaid expansion, effectively denying millions of low-income people access to cheap health insurance.

Other studies have found that even those who were supposed to qualify for subsidies aren't getting them as readily as expected.

Finally, plain ignorance may also be at play here.

Back in September, a whopping 76 percent of the uninsured were largely unfamiliar with the law. And last month, nearly 60 percent still said they hadn't bothered to look up even basic information about potential coverage options. Even now, only 23 percent of the uninsured have visited a federal or state exchange site, according to Gallup.

In other words, it's possible that at least some of the opposition isn't stemming from the law's true impact, but merely to its perceived impact. A huge chunk of the uninsured don't know what the law would do for them, but they don't like it anyway.

That shouldn't be too surprising. More people report seeing negative, rather than positive, media coverage of ObamaCare, per Kaiser. So though a majority of the uninsured say the law hasn't really affected them yet, twice as many (30 percent) say they're worse off under it than those (13 percent) who say they're better off.

Now, the good news for ObamaCare is that half the uninsured still plan to get coverage, according to Kaiser's survey. And with the federal exchange performing much better than before, it's certainly possible the negative perceptions will turn around as the uninsured give it another shot, or try it out for the first time.

Opinion contributor

Throughout the year, we have seen Democrats across the country uniting around a new legislative proposal that would end Medicare as we know it and take away benefits that seniors have paid for their entire lives.

Dishonestly called “Medicare for All,” the Democratic proposal would establish a government-run, single-payer health care system that eliminates all private and employer-based health care plans and would cost an astonishing $32.6 trillion during its first 10 years.

As a candidate, I promised that we would protect coverage for patients with pre-existing conditions and create new health care insurance options that would lower premiums. I have kept that promise, and we are now seeing health insurance premiums coming down.

STANDARDS EDITOR:Medicare op-ed and all the reaction show democracy in action

Related:Factcheck.org has looked into statements made in this column.

I also made a solemn promise to our great seniors to protect Medicare. That is why I am fighting so hard against the Democrats' plan that would eviscerate Medicare. Democrats have already harmed seniors by slashing Medicare by more than $800 billion over 10 years to pay for Obamacare. Likewise, Democrats would gut Medicare with their planned government takeover of American health care.

The Democrats' plan threatens America's seniors

The Democrats' plan means that after a life of hard work and sacrifice, seniors would no longer be able to depend on the benefits they were promised. By eliminating Medicare as a program for seniors, and outlawing the ability of Americans to enroll in private and employer-based plans, the Democratic plan would inevitably lead to the massive rationing of health care. Doctors and hospitals would be put out of business. Seniors would lose access to their favorite doctors. There would be long wait lines for appointments and procedures. Previously covered care would effectively be denied.

In practice, the Democratic Party’s so-called Medicare for All would really be Medicare for None. Under the Democrats' plan, today’s Medicare would be forced to die.

The Democrats' plan also would mean the end of choice for seniors over their own health care decisions. Instead, Democrats would give total power and control over seniors’ health care decisions to the bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.

More:Donald Trump knows nothing about Medicare, health care or Democrats: Talker

My family escaped socialism, now my fellow Democrats think we should move the party in its direction

Bernie Sanders: Trump lies about 'Medicare for All' and he's made health care worse

The first thing the Democratic plan will do to end choice for seniors is eliminate Medicare Advantage plans for about 20 million seniors as well as eliminate other private health plans that seniors currently use to supplement their Medicare coverage.

Next, the Democrats would eliminate every American’s private and employer-based health plan. It is right there in their proposed legislation: Democrats outlaw private health plans that offer the same benefits as the government plan.

Americans might think that such an extreme, anti-senior, anti-choice and anti-consumer proposal for government-run health care would find little support among Democrats in Congress.

Unfortunately, they would be wrong: 123 Democrats in the House of Representatives — 64 percent of House Democrats — as well as 15 Democrats in the Senate have already formally co-sponsored this legislation. Democratic nominees for governor in Florida, California and Maryland are all campaigning in support of it, as are many Democratic congressional candidates.

Democrats want open-borders socialism

The truth is that the centrist Democratic Party is dead. The new Democrats are radical socialists who want to model America’s economy after Venezuela.

If Democrats win control of Congress this November, we will come dangerously closer to socialism in America. Government-run health care is just the beginning. Democrats are also pushing massive government control of education, private-sector businesses and other major sectors of the U.S. economy.

Every single citizen will be harmed by such a radical shift in American culture and life. Virtually everywhere it has been tried, socialism has brought suffering, misery and decay.

Indeed, the Democrats' commitment to government-run health care is all the more menacing to our seniors and our economy when paired with some Democrats' absolute commitment to end enforcement of our immigration laws by abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement. That means millions more would cross our borders illegally and take advantage of health care paid for by American taxpayers.

Today’s Democratic Party is for open-borders socialism. This radical agenda would destroy American prosperity. Under its vision, costs will spiral out of control. Taxes will skyrocket. And Democrats will seek to slash budgets for seniors’ Medicare, Social Security and defense.

Republicans believe that a Medicare program that was created for seniors and paid for by seniors their entire lives should always be protected and preserved. I am committed to resolutely defending Medicare and Social Security from the radical socialist plans of the Democrats. For the sake of our country, our prosperity, our seniors and all Americans — this is a fight we must win.

It 's called the Better Care Reconciliation Act ( BCRA ) , and it 's quite a sight to behold . Apparently realizing this is their one shot to kill ObamaCare and remake the whole health-care safety net , the Republicans seemed to have crammed every last ounce of cruelty and hypocrisy they could muster into the bill .
1 . It 's basically a plan to destroy Medicaid . That 's the government program that provides health insurance for low-income Americans . It covers more people than Medicare , most of its beneficiaries are children , the elderly , and the disabled , and it pays the bulk of Americans ' long-term care and nursing home costs .

But the BCRA would also massively cut the pre-ObamaCare Medicaid program as well . It would force states to spend less Medicaid dollars per person . ( Though there 's a carve-out for the least-populated states , where per person Medicaid costs are the highest . ) And it would give states the option of imposing work requirements on beneficiaries .
But most importantly , it would first cap the program 's growth rate to the inflation rate in medical prices , then change it to the inflation rate for the entire economy in 2025 . This is a gargantuan cut in the share of spending the federal government was expected to contribute in the future — far larger than the 25-percent cut envisioned by the House GOP .
Finally , the BCRA also drops the income eligibility threshold for premium subsidies to zero .

Instead of phasing out at 400 percent of the federal poverty line , like they do under ObamaCare , the BCRA 's subsidies would phase out at 350 percent . More than that , though , it would rejigger the formula that calculates subsidies for everyone : Americans at all income levels from 0 to 400 percent of the federal poverty line would often be expected to pay a bigger share of their premiums out of pocket . Their subsidies would also be benchmarked to significantly less generous coverage plans than under ObamaCare , with deductibles that could skyrocket by as much as 60 percent . Americans will basically have to pay much more for worse health insurance .
This obviously contradicts all the promises that Republicans and President Trump have made on the issue . It 's also worth noting that Trump 's own base — older Americans in rural areas — will be the people hit hardest by these cuts .
3 . All this pays for massive tax cuts for the wealthy . You can see this in the Congressional Budget Office 's score of the House version of TrumpCare . The BCRA is similar enough — it keeps virtually all the House 's tax cuts , and its Medicaid cuts are deeper over the long run — that the CBO 's analysis generally applies to it , too . The House plan would cut Medicaid by $ 834 billion and premium subsidies by $ 276 billion over 10 years . Then it would cut taxes on employers , big medical businesses , and wealthy Americans by $ 874 billion over the same period , with a little change left over for deficit reduction . In broad strokes , that 's what the Senate version would do too ( its own CBO analysis wo n't be out till early next week ) .
But what 's really amusing is that the biggest cut in the BCRA is to a capital gains tax . It would only apply to people who earn more than $ 200,000 annually and it would be retroactive . So it ca n't even be justified as an incentive to boost economic growth .
In other words , the whole bill is basically a giant giveaway to the wealthy , paid for by cutting health care to the poor .
4 . It would hypocritically resurrect insurer `` bailouts . '' The Senate bill would create funds to help insurance companies provide coverage when the individual markets are unstable .

'' It would allot another $ 62 billion in grants that states can apply for between 2019 and 2026 for similar purposes .
On the policy merits , this is actually a good idea . But it 's also utterly brazen hypocrisy on the Republicans ' part . ObamaCare created similar mechanisms for stabilizing insurers ' finances , but the GOP insisted on stripping them out in 2015 on the grounds that they were a `` bailout '' for the insurance industry .

After weeks of lock-down secrecy, Senate Republicans have finally released their version of TrumpCare.

It's called the Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA), and it's quite a sight to behold. Apparently realizing this is their one shot to kill ObamaCare and remake the whole health-care safety net, the Republicans seemed to have crammed every last ounce of cruelty and hypocrisy they could muster into the bill.

Here's a rundown of the BCRA's greatest hits.

1. It's basically a plan to destroy Medicaid. That's the government program that provides health insurance for low-income Americans. It covers more people than Medicare, most of its beneficiaries are children, the elderly, and the disabled, and it pays the bulk of Americans' long-term care and nursing home costs.

ObamaCare massively expanded eligibility for the program, and the BCRA would phase that expansion out by 2024.

But the BCRA would also massively cut the pre-ObamaCare Medicaid program as well. It would force states to spend less Medicaid dollars per person. (Though there's a carve-out for the least-populated states, where per person Medicaid costs are the highest.) And it would give states the option of imposing work requirements on beneficiaries.

But most importantly, it would first cap the program's growth rate to the inflation rate in medical prices, then change it to the inflation rate for the entire economy in 2025. This is a gargantuan cut in the share of spending the federal government was expected to contribute in the future — far larger than the 25-percent cut envisioned by the House GOP.

Finally, the BCRA also drops the income eligibility threshold for premium subsidies to zero. That's significant because, under ObamaCare, you didn't get the subsidies if you were poor enough, because Medicaid would step in. So in a sense, the BCRA is really a plan to slowly strangle Medicaid and replace it with subsidies to buy private coverage.

Which brings us to the next point …

2. Its subsidies for private insurance premiums are terrible. ObamaCare included subsidies to help people afford the premiums on the state-based insurance exchanges it created. And one of ObamaCare's big problems is that these subsidies are too skimpy. The BCRA's subsidies would be even skimpier.

Instead of phasing out at 400 percent of the federal poverty line, like they do under ObamaCare, the BCRA's subsidies would phase out at 350 percent. More than that, though, it would rejigger the formula that calculates subsidies for everyone: Americans at all income levels from 0 to 400 percent of the federal poverty line would often be expected to pay a bigger share of their premiums out of pocket. Their subsidies would also be benchmarked to significantly less generous coverage plans than under ObamaCare, with deductibles that could skyrocket by as much as 60 percent. Americans will basically have to pay much more for worse health insurance.

But unlike recent campaign cycles , when Republicans capitalized on Obamacare sticker shock to help propel them to control of Congress and the White House , they ’ re now likely to be the ones feeling the wrath of voters .
That ’ s because Republicans are now in total control of the federal government and therefore on the hook for the health care system ’ s chronic shortcomings . Polling data has consistently suggested that more voters will blame Republicans for future problems with Obamacare . In addition , the GOP ’ s repeated failures to repeal Obamacare after eight years of campaign promises will make it difficult to galvanize the base on health care .
Democrats and their allies have been hammering President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans for “ sabotaging ” the health care markets and driving up premiums . Protect Our Care has been running digital ads in 13 states featuring news coverage of big rate hikes and concluding with a sound bite from Trump : “ Let Obamacare implode . ”
They hope that message will stick with voters come November .
“ The political implications go only as far as people understand that they are a direct consequence of the administration ’ s actions , ” said Rep. Raul Ruiz ( D-Calif. ) , a medical doctor who sits on a key committee that oversees health care . “ If they realize that , then they will be very , very upset with them . ”
In particular , Democrats blame Republicans for eliminating the mandate penalty for failing to obtain health insurance , which was designed to be a cudgel to compel people who might otherwise go uninsured to buy coverage . They also point to the Trump administration ’ s efforts to make it easier to buy skinnier , cheaper plans that don ’ t meet the Affordable Care Act ’ s coverage requirements and patient protections as an exacerbating factor .
“ Once they fractured the mandate , that changed the insurance pool , ” said Rep. Richard Neal ( D-Mass . ) , ranking member on the Ways and Means Committee . “ Insurance is based upon shared risk , meaning fewer people contributing , the premiums escalate . ”

Republicans scoff at the notion that they ’ re to blame for Obamacare ’ s failings . They point out that big rate hikes were a chronic condition of the exchange markets long before they took full control of the government .
“ The Affordable Care Act has been a total failure , ” said Rep . Buddy Carter ( R-Ga. ) , a pharmacist who serves on one of the key House committees dealing with health care . “ It ’ s been a train wreck since Day One . What we ’ re trying to do is to fix it . ”
Republicans further argue that Democrats sabotaged a bipartisan effort to pass legislation designed to stabilize the markets and reduce rate hikes . They contend that Democratic concerns over abortion language that ultimately derailed the deal were a smokescreen .
“ They are the reason why we didn ’ t pass the legislation that would have solved the issue , ” said Sen. Bill Cassidy ( R-La . ) , who has been closely involved in efforts to come up with a Republican plan to replace the ACA . “ I can only guess that it ’ s politics . ”
Democrats counter that the GOP added the abortion restrictions knowing that would be the deal-breaker .
Insurance experts generally agree that the rate hikes will be more severe because of actions taken by the Republican-led Congress and the Trump administration .
“ If it hadn ’ t been for the individual mandate being repealed , and the threat of short-term and other loosely regulated plans proliferating , I think we would have seen single-digit premiums increases , ” said Cynthia Cox , an insurance expert at the Kaiser Family Foundation . “ Insurers are performing much better on the exchange markets than they had in the early years . ”
However , that strong financial performance of the markets is also complicating Democratic talking points about sabotage . In many states , competition is increasing as insurers see opportunities to move into markets with little competition . Most notably , Oscar Health — the tech-friendly startup that ’ s lost hundreds of millions in the Obamacare markets — is entering or expanding its footprint in six states .
That ’ s a stark contrast from last summer , when dozens of counties across the country were at risk of having no competing insurers due to market exits .
But double-digit premium increases are still likely in many states , as evidenced by the rate filings that have been trickling out in recent weeks . Premiums for the most popular Obamacare plans are going up by 15 percent on average — about $ 100 per month — according to an analysis of rate filings in 10 states by Avalere Health .

But unlike recent campaign cycles, when Republicans capitalized on Obamacare sticker shock to help propel them to control of Congress and the White House, they’re now likely to be the ones feeling the wrath of voters.

That’s because Republicans are now in total control of the federal government and therefore on the hook for the health care system’s chronic shortcomings. Polling data has consistently suggested that more voters will blame Republicans for future problems with Obamacare. In addition, the GOP’s repeated failures to repeal Obamacare after eight years of campaign promises will make it difficult to galvanize the base on health care.

Democrats and their allies have been hammering President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans for “sabotaging” the health care markets and driving up premiums. Protect Our Care has been running digital ads in 13 states featuring news coverage of big rate hikes and concluding with a sound bite from Trump: “Let Obamacare implode.”

They hope that message will stick with voters come November.

“The political implications go only as far as people understand that they are a direct consequence of the administration’s actions,” said Rep. Raul Ruiz (D-Calif.), a medical doctor who sits on a key committee that oversees health care. “If they realize that, then they will be very, very upset with them.”

In particular, Democrats blame Republicans for eliminating the mandate penalty for failing to obtain health insurance, which was designed to be a cudgel to compel people who might otherwise go uninsured to buy coverage. They also point to the Trump administration’s efforts to make it easier to buy skinnier, cheaper plans that don’t meet the Affordable Care Act’s coverage requirements and patient protections as an exacerbating factor.

“Once they fractured the mandate, that changed the insurance pool,” said Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.), ranking member on the Ways and Means Committee. “Insurance is based upon shared risk, meaning fewer people contributing, the premiums escalate.”

Republicans scoff at the notion that they’re to blame for Obamacare’s failings. They point out that big rate hikes were a chronic condition of the exchange markets long before they took full control of the government.

“The Affordable Care Act has been a total failure,” said Rep. Buddy Carter (R-Ga.), a pharmacist who serves on one of the key House committees dealing with health care. “It’s been a train wreck since Day One. What we’re trying to do is to fix it.”

Republicans further argue that Democrats sabotaged a bipartisan effort to pass legislation designed to stabilize the markets and reduce rate hikes. They contend that Democratic concerns over abortion language that ultimately derailed the deal were a smokescreen.

“They are the reason why we didn’t pass the legislation that would have solved the issue,” said Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), who has been closely involved in efforts to come up with a Republican plan to replace the ACA. “I can only guess that it’s politics.”

Democrats counter that the GOP added the abortion restrictions knowing that would be the deal-breaker.

Insurance experts generally agree that the rate hikes will be more severe because of actions taken by the Republican-led Congress and the Trump administration.

“If it hadn’t been for the individual mandate being repealed, and the threat of short-term and other loosely regulated plans proliferating, I think we would have seen single-digit premiums increases,” said Cynthia Cox, an insurance expert at the Kaiser Family Foundation. “Insurers are performing much better on the exchange markets than they had in the early years.”

However, that strong financial performance of the markets is also complicating Democratic talking points about sabotage. In many states, competition is increasing as insurers see opportunities to move into markets with little competition. Most notably, Oscar Health — the tech-friendly startup that’s lost hundreds of millions in the Obamacare markets — is entering or expanding its footprint in six states.

That’s a stark contrast from last summer, when dozens of counties across the country were at risk of having no competing insurers due to market exits.

But double-digit premium increases are still likely in many states, as evidenced by the rate filings that have been trickling out in recent weeks. Premiums for the most popular Obamacare plans are going up by 15 percent on average — about $100 per month — according to an analysis of rate filings in 10 states by Avalere Health. While rates won’t be finalized until the fall, it’s already clear that there will be wide discrepancies across the country that could affect the political salience of the issue.

Insurers in Maryland want to raise rates on the most popular plans by an eye-popping 53 percent, while New York insurers are seeking average premium increases of 24 percent. By contrast, insurers in Pennsylvania want to raise premiums by only 5 percent on average. All four insurers selling Obamacare plans in Minnesota want to decrease premiums.

One big factor affecting the severity of the rate hikes is how insurers account for the removal of the individual mandate. The Congressional Budget Office has projected it will increase premiums by 10 percent, mainly because fewer healthy people will opt to enroll, but Republicans have scoffed at that as an unrealistic assessment of the mandate’s significance.

Highmark Health, which sells Obamacare plans in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Delaware, plans to raise premiums by 5 percent next year to account for the repeal of the mandate. The insurer made money on its Obamacare customers last year after piling up big losses on that book of business in prior years.

“The rates are catching up to the risks,” said David Holmberg, Highmark Health’s CEO. “Every time you change the rules you disrupt that.”

The other major wild card is the Trump administration’s efforts to increase the availability of cheaper plans that don’t meet the ACA’s coverage requirements.

`` How can we tax people for not buying a product from a website that does n't work ? '' House Speaker John Boehner said .
The healthcare.gov site opened for enrollment on Oct. 1 , but users are still having trouble breaking through the website 's myriad problems just to sign up .
Reports have since surfaced about warning signs that the site was not ready for launch ; raising more questions , another report said the price tag for the site has grown from $ 93 million to $ 634 million .
The administration all along has tried to explain the problems as a product of the overwhelming interest in the insurance products on the site -- a matter of sheer volume .
But critics say the site was just poorly designed . Computer software experts told FoxNews.com the site may experience significant technical glitches for months .
`` I would n't rule out that possibility , '' said George Edwards , a computer scientist and professor at the University of Southern California . It all depends on when they identify the bugs , where they are , and if they can be resolved easily , he said -- all while the site is running and open to millions of customers .
`` [ It 's ] like trying to repair a car while someone is driving it , '' he told FoxNews.com .
Not only was the site still experiencing substantial problems Wednesday , a week after launching , but the White House had reportedly been aware for months that the HealthCare.gov website had flaws and might not be ready to launch . Yet officials insisted on the Oct. 1 roll out anyway .
Edwards and other software engineering experts said that a significant number of issues appeared to relate to the `` front end '' or user experience . This typically means there is something wrong with the basic construction of the software , in particular , the Javascript code that activates within the browser .
`` I was trying to use it as a consumer ... and I could see the Javascript errors , '' said James Turner , a member of the technical staff at software company Beeonics and contributing editor at O'Reilly.com .

In addition to the high volume of people who accessed Healthcare.gov when it was launched on Oct. 1 , crippling the site on and off for the first few days , complaints have evolved around users ' inability to create new accounts , or once they do , not being able to log on and move forward with choosing a health plan -- the primary function of the site .

So far , according to the White House and Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) , which is overseeing Healthcare.gov , the major culprit has been volume and capacity .
`` An extraordinary number of people are coming to check out HealthCare.gov . Traffic on the web site and at the call center continues to be high , suggesting a strong interest by consumers in learning about their health coverage options , '' HHS said in a statement to FoxNews.com .

`` Because of the time constraints , they 're crowd-sourcing their quality assurance to the American public , '' Turner said . `` We 're being used to find the bugs . ''
The company contracted in 2011 for $ 93 million to build the website , CGI Group Inc. , has so far declined comment .

""An extraordinary number of people are coming to check out HealthCare.gov. Traffic on the web site and at the call center continues to be high, suggesting a strong interest by consumers in learning about their health coverage options,"" HHS said in a statement to FoxNews.com.

""To improve access to the system, work at night has significantly cut down on time people wait before accessing the website."" Officials have stated that the site had some 8.6 million unique visitors over the first three days, with as many as 250,000 on at the same time.

Edwards and Turner said that, aside from being able to see the code on the front end, it is difficult to know exactly what is going on with the site.

""Because of the time constraints, they're crowd-sourcing their quality assurance to the American public,"" Turner said. ""We're being used to find the bugs.""

The company contracted in 2011 for $93 million to build the website, CGI Group Inc., has so far declined comment.

""In my opinion, intermittent, but not fatal, problems will persist for some time -- perhaps even until December 15,"" Edwards said.

But that prospect is revealing a problem : States can ’ t afford to go it alone .
Massachusetts and Wisconsin took radically different paths toward the goal of expanding access to health-care insurance . But the prospect of a repeal of the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) – and the loss of the federal money that goes with it – is threatening to blow significant holes in both state programs .
For Massachusetts , the issue is that its aggressive attempt to provide universal coverage is propped up by billions of federal dollars .

In short , no matter which approach they take , states might face a difficult choice : Who should they not cover ?
As recently as six years ago , 18 percent of Americans had no health-care insurance . Today , that percentage has been cut roughly in half , and even Republicans , in their 2016 “ A Better Way : Health Care ” plan , say they want a system that “ ensures access to coverage for all Americans . ”
A repeal could test how much Americans ’ expectations about health care coverage have or haven ’ t shifted under Obamacare .
For now , states are facing uncertainty , not knowing when Republicans might repeal the ACA and how .
For health officials in many states , the concerns is that Republicans in Congress could pare back or eliminate two key provisions :
• The subsidies that help low-and middle-income Americans pay for heath insurance .
• The expansion of Medicaid , passed along with the ACA , that allowed states to cover more of their uninsured . Until 2020 , it is fully paid for by the federal government . After that , the federal government would pay 90 percent of the costs .
Thirty-one states accepted the Medicaid expansion , while the subsidies are available in all states . In Massachusetts , for example , the expansion provides coverage for 306,000 people who would otherwise not have any , while the subsidies have enabled 191,000 more to buy insurance .

A repeal could test how much Americans’ expectations about health care coverage have or haven’t shifted under Obamacare.

For now, states are facing uncertainty, not knowing when Republicans might repeal the ACA and how.

Massachusetts: the liberal model

For health officials in many states, the concerns is that Republicans in Congress could pare back or eliminate two key provisions:

• The subsidies that help low-and middle-income Americans pay for heath insurance.

• The expansion of Medicaid, passed along with the ACA, that allowed states to cover more of their uninsured. Until 2020, it is fully paid for by the federal government. After that, the federal government would pay 90 percent of the costs.

But Massachusetts’ predicament runs much deeper. Its first-of-its-kind health-care law, signed in 2006 by then-Gov.

“It’s unrealistic to expect states to make progress on health care coverage while the federal government is pulling billions of dollars out of states,” says Joshua Sharfstein, an associate dean for public health practice at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.

Wisconsin: the conservative model

That is where Wisconsin’s BadgerCare comes in.

When originally signed into law in 2008, it had grand goals. It was intended to make “health care in Wisconsin a birthright, not a ticket to bankruptcy,” said then-Gov. Gov. Jim Doyle, a Democrat.

Then Gov. Scott Walker (R) took over and turned BadgerCare into a model for the Republican vision of health-care reform. That began by declining the Medicaid expansion money.

“The way federalism is supposed to work is states create a program like in Wisconsin, and then other states can say ‘OK. What did they achieve? What did it cost?’ And they can learn from each other and get a better safety net,” says Mr. Cannon of Cato. “But if states don’t have to face the cost of their policy decisions, if it is all being crowded out by federal programs like Medicaid, you don’t get that experimentation and learning.”

To that end, Governor Walker experimented. Unlike other states that rejected the Medicaid expansion, he still expanded coverage to everyone living below the poverty level in the state.

Though Wisconsin’s uninsured rate is going down slower than many other states, it is going down. And everyone living in poverty is insured.

But there is a catch. To cover everyone up to 100 percent of the federal poverty level, the state left those above it uncovered, knowing that the federal subsidies in Obamacare would be a safety net.

State shortfalls

Some Republicans in Washington have spoken of reforming health-care spending by giving money to states as lump sum block grants, rather than reimbursing costs, but many experts suggest that would lead to a decrease in federal spending.

If the federal assistance expanded under Obamacare is pulled back, the only answer to fill the gap could be state taxes – an unpopular solution.

Ever since the Supreme Court decided last month that an expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act should be optional, quite a few Republican governors have been vowing to take a pass.

On Monday, Texas Gov. Rick Perry declared that he won't be expanding Medicaid. He joins other GOP state executives who have rejected offering Medicaid to people with incomes up to 133 percent of the poverty line. This year that's just under $15,000 a year for an individual, or a little over $25,000 for a family of three.

""We're not going to participate in any exchanges,"" Perry said on Fox News. ""We're not going to expand Medicaid. We're just not going to be a part of, again, socializing health care in the state of Texas. And going in direct conflict with our Founding Fathers' wishes and freedom, for that matter.""

Perry and his colleagues say they're rejecting the health law for mostly ideological reasons. That's because when it comes to Medicaid, the states don't appear to be on the hook for very much money.

""The law provided 100 percent coverage for people newly eligible for Medicaid by the federal government, and 90 percent in the out years,"" says Jeff Goldsmith, a health policy analyst who teaches public health at the University of Virginia.

Compare that to the rest of the Medicaid program, where the federal government pays an average of just under 60 percent.

But it's not just those newly eligible people states are worried about.

""Folks don't really understand the struggle states are in,"" says Dennis Smith, secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Health Services and former head of the federal Medicaid program under President George W. Bush.

Smith says this year his state put more than a billion dollars into its existing Medicaid program. ""And that took up literally almost the entire new revenues available to the state — meaning revenues not just for health care, but also intended for education, transportation, law enforcement and everything else,"" he says.

Even so, Wisconsin had a $600 million budget shortfall. ""So states just don't have the dollars, even with those enhanced federal match rates,"" Smith says.

But what really has many state leaders worried is something called the ""woodwork effect."" When big parts of the health law go into force in 2014, they worry it will bring out of the woodwork the millions of people who are already eligible for Medicaid but aren't already enrolled.

When some people look to see if they can get health insurance through one of the health exchanges, they may discover a cheaper option. ""They will find out that they're actually eligible for Medicaid,"" says Bruce Lesley, president of First Focus, an advocacy group for children and families.

But many of those people signing up for Medicaid won't be members of the newly eligible expansion group, whose bills will be largely paid by the federal government. They'll be regular old Medicaid beneficiaries, and states will have to pay up to half their costs.

Goldsmith says what has state officials most worried is how easy it will be for these currently eligible but unenrolled Medicaid recipients to sign up.

""It won't be an in-person visit, it won't be a 'bring six forms of ID,' "" he says. ""There will be an expedited — lubricated, if you will — process to get people onto the rolls, and I think that's the part that's giving state budget officers serious indigestion at this point.""

healthcare,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/3/bill-schuette-a-prescription-for-health-care-after/,OPINION: A prescription for health care after Burwell,2015-03-03,Bill Schuette,"On Wednesday , the nine justices of the United States Supreme Court will consider the case of King v. Burwell , concerning the constitutionality of Obamacare , determining the limits of President Obama ’ s executive power and the ability of the president to rewrite laws on his own while ignoring the constitutional duties of the legislative branch of government .
The court ’ s ruling would also impact the health care subsidies some citizens receive in Michigan and in 37 other states .
Before the Supreme Court issues an opinion , responsible state and federal leaders should construct a new health care model . A fresh approach to overhaul and remedy inequalities in America ’ s health care system is overdue . The Affordable Care Act , better known as Obamacare , has been an empty suit and did not live up to the president ’ s promises . Many Americans could not keep their health care plan , paid huge increases to stay on a plan , or could not keep their doctor .
Here is a prescription for health care options after Burwell :
First Principles : Any overhaul of health care should be patient-focused , consumer-driven and should favor the free market over a single-payer system or government-run bureaucracy . To paraphrase a popular ad , when companies compete , the consumer wins .
Eighteen-month “ safe harbor ” hold-harmless period : The potential Supreme Court ruling , concerning bedrock provisions of the U.S. Constitution and excessive use of presidential power , could cause stress for many individuals and families who may not be able to purchase insurance without the subsidies . A “ safe harbor ” provision for a 12- to 18-month period to help people who might lose subsidies would provide sufficient time for the president and Congress , as well as state legislatures , to enact a much-improved health care system that provides insurance to many who are uninsured , deals with pre-existing conditions , expands coverage and also lowers costs .
“ You choose ” option — opt-in , opt-out : Give Americans choice , the opportunity to choose their preferred health care plan . If you prefer Obamacare , then opt-in and keep it . But also guarantee Americans the freedom to purchase other health care options , separate from Obamacare . Former Sen. Phil Gramm refers to this as the “ freedom option ” and he is right . Choice is as American as apple pie , and the federal government ought not to be dictating what health insurance plan Americans can not buy .
End Obamacare mandates and regulations : One example should suffice : repeal the medical device tax . Importantly , this is not just a Republican proposal . It enjoys broad , bipartisan support , including support from Democratic Sens . Al Franken , Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar .
End tax inequality : It is time to end a health care tax inequality that favors employer-provided health insurance while taxing millions who desire to buy insurance on the individual market . Continue to protect the tax treatment of job providers that offer health plans to their workers , and then extend tax credits to those who buy insurance on their own . The credits should be annual , age-adjusted and class-blind , available for a variety of health coverage options to make it easier for the uninsured to afford coverage .
Encourage the use of Health Savings Accounts : By providing access to Health Savings Accounts , consumers would have greater incentives to control costs and would be able to shop for the best health insurance plan that meets their needs .

On Wednesday, the nine justices of the United States Supreme Court will consider the case of King v. Burwell, concerning the constitutionality of Obamacare, determining the limits of President Obama’s executive power and the ability of the president to rewrite laws on his own while ignoring the constitutional duties of the legislative branch of government.

The court’s ruling would also impact the health care subsidies some citizens receive in Michigan and in 37 other states.

Before the Supreme Court issues an opinion, responsible state and federal leaders should construct a new health care model. A fresh approach to overhaul and remedy inequalities in America’s health care system is overdue. The Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, has been an empty suit and did not live up to the president’s promises. Many Americans could not keep their health care plan, paid huge increases to stay on a plan, or could not keep their doctor.

Here is a prescription for health care options after Burwell:

First Principles: Any overhaul of health care should be patient-focused, consumer-driven and should favor the free market over a single-payer system or government-run bureaucracy. To paraphrase a popular ad, when companies compete, the consumer wins.

Eighteen-month “safe harbor” hold-harmless period: The potential Supreme Court ruling, concerning bedrock provisions of the U.S. Constitution and excessive use of presidential power, could cause stress for many individuals and families who may not be able to purchase insurance without the subsidies. A “safe harbor” provision for a 12- to 18-month period to help people who might lose subsidies would provide sufficient time for the president and Congress, as well as state legislatures, to enact a much-improved health care system that provides insurance to many who are uninsured, deals with pre-existing conditions, expands coverage and also lowers costs.

“You choose” option — opt-in, opt-out: Give Americans choice, the opportunity to choose their preferred health care plan. If you prefer Obamacare, then opt-in and keep it. But also guarantee Americans the freedom to purchase other health care options, separate from Obamacare. Former Sen. Phil Gramm refers to this as the “freedom option” and he is right. Choice is as American as apple pie, and the federal government ought not to be dictating what health insurance plan Americans cannot buy.

End Obamacare mandates and regulations: One example should suffice: repeal the medical device tax. Importantly, this is not just a Republican proposal. It enjoys broad, bipartisan support, including support from Democratic Sens. Al Franken, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar.

End tax inequality: It is time to end a health care tax inequality that favors employer-provided health insurance while taxing millions who desire to buy insurance on the individual market. Continue to protect the tax treatment of job providers that offer health plans to their workers, and then extend tax credits to those who buy insurance on their own. The credits should be annual, age-adjusted and class-blind, available for a variety of health coverage options to make it easier for the uninsured to afford coverage.

Encourage the use of Health Savings Accounts: By providing access to Health Savings Accounts, consumers would have greater incentives to control costs and would be able to shop for the best health insurance plan that meets their needs. This can be encouraged through the use of one-time tax credits to get consumers started.

Allow interstate health plan purchases: End “lockout” provisions, which prevent consumers from purchasing health care insurance no matter where they live. Americans should be free to purchase health insurance anywhere in the nation. Portability of health care will increase competition and lower costs.

States make better decisions: The individual states should have broad opportunity to offer a diversity of health care insurance options to their citizens, including free-market options of premium subsidies, Health Savings Accounts and direct primary care options, as well as high-deductible plans coupled with other options. Medicaid recipients should be allowed to participate in any private market health plan.

Establish high-risk pools: Federally subsidized, state-managed high-risk pools should be used to cover the costs for those with high-cost health care needs.

Require insurers to cover adult children. Maintain the reform enabling adult children to retain coverage under the health insurance plan of their parents up to age 27.

Insure pre-existing conditions: No individuals should have his insurance canceled because of a pre-existing condition. All consumers should be given a transition period in which to purchase coverage so that no one is excluded because of his health history.

Some Washington elites are predicting gloom and doom should a majority of the U.S. Supreme Court justices rule against the Obama administration in King v. Burwell. In fact, just the opposite is true. The court case provides policymakers with a moment in time to offer real reforms that expand choice and competition, put the patient first and greatly improve options for health care coverage.

The Affordable Care Act violated the very first principle of medicine: Do no harm. This prescription is better for our health care system, and most importantly, for consumers. As with any prescription, if not administered immediately, the ailment only gets worse.

Patchwork healthcare

Why is Obamacare so complex? Proponents point out that short of creating a new federal healthcare system, any US attempt to insure the uninsured would inevitably prove highly complicated. Unlike most other industrialized nations, the US healthcare system relies primarily on employer-based insurance, instead of a government-financed system. And insurance is regulated by the 50 states. So Obamacare inevitably represents the application of a new patch to an already complex patchwork.

The law actually has three primary purposes: to lower the numbers of uninsured, make care more affordable to those who need it, and reduce health-care costs. Such objectives are difficult to argue with, particularly in a nation that leads the industrialised world in the percentage of its citizens who cannot afford care, yet which spends far more per capita on healthcare than any other nation – 18 percent of GDP, while for other comparable nations the number is less than 12 percent.

A nation split

But the controversy and fierce antagonism surrounding Obamacare are nothing new in the United States. In the US system, the legislative branch makes and funds laws, while the executive branch bears the responsibility of implementing them. The founders of the US system of government, men such as Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, envisioned a system of checks and balances, in which each of the three branches of government (judiciary included) would impede the will of the other.

Some Americans look around the country and see many disadvantaged people unable to obtain and pay for adequate medical care. Moved by the suffering of their neighbors, they naturally think there ought to be a law ensuring that everyone has access to care. Others see vast inefficiencies in health care, and believe steps must be taken to reign in the huge increases in health-care costs that the US traditionally experiences each year. Such people are likely to support Obamacare.

But other Americans look around and see a bloated federal government choking the US economy and infringing on economic and political liberties. They believe Washington has become too influential already, and federal programs such as Obamacare only increase the reach of an already intrusive government. They worry the US is becoming a “nanny state”, where people look to the government to solve their problems.

If you want a federal government that is united, efficient, and nimble, then the US Constitution makes no sense. On the other hand, if you believe social good cannot or should not be provided by the federal government, and that far from maximizing the government’s ability to provide benefits the most important function of the Constitution is to prevent government’s excessive expansion, the current political climate may seem less perverse.

Those who expect the government to do more to help those in need look on the current Washington political climate as dysfunctional, heaping blame on those obstructing the compassionate will of the people to do more to help the disadvantaged. Those who believe that the government is doing too much already and instead needs to be trimmed back regard the same impasses with satisfaction, believing that they further tarnish an overweening government’s reputation.

In short, the bewildering US healthcare debate, including the government shut down, isn’t quite as incomprehensible as it first appears. Americans are not united in a desire for more and better government, including federally mandated health care. Many Americans actually want less government, and they are willing to use whatever means they have at their disposal to thwart what they see as an un-Constitutional and even un-American expansion of government’s reach.

healthcare,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/2019/3/15/18265814/beto-orourke-medicare-for-all-health-care,It is wildly unclear whether Beto O’Rourke supports Medicare-for-all,2019-03-15,"Sarah Kliff, Alex Abad-Santos, Jen Kirby, Alex Ward, Jane Coaston, Anna North","It ’ s easy to find clips of presidential candidate Beto O ’ Rourke talking about health care . He posts about it on Facebook . It comes up at multiple town halls that he held during his 2018 Senate campaign .
What ’ s a lot harder is figuring out exactly what type of health care system the former Texas Congress member supports .
O ’ Rourke entered the Democratic primary Thursday , and a close reading of his policy positions on health care reveals he vacillates between Medicare-for-all as “ the best way to ensure Americans get the health care they need ” and criticism of the Medicare-for-all plans offered . He once described writing his own Medicare-for-all plan , but so far , no such plan has been made public . His presidential campaign site doesn ’ t yet have a section on policy proposals .
Best I can tell , O ’ Rourke definitely supports the idea of universal health care where all Americans have access to affordable coverage . But what exactly he means is murky .
Viewed one way , O ’ Rourke may just be keeping an open mind . Some of his criticisms of Bernie Sanders ’ s plan are interesting ( he favors copayments , for instance , which are a feature of many European health care systems but not Canada ’ s ) . He mentions a “ dual system , ” potentially a mix of private and public insurers .
But viewed another way , his difficult-to-decipher health care views could also suggest more tepid engagement with an issue that will be crucial to the primary debate . His views on health care are , in a way , similar to his views on immigration , which the Washington Post described as “ no wall , few specifics . ”
O ’ Rourke isn ’ t turning up with a binder full of white papers . And to run a presidential campaign — or to run a White House — he ’ s eventually going to need those .
A brief timeline of how Beto O ’ Rourke talks about Medicare-for-all
Here ’ s a bit of a timeline from what I ’ ve been able to piece together of O ’ Rourke ’ s views on Medicare-for-all , looking at the statements he ’ s made and interviews he ’ s done over the past year and a half :
June 15 , 2017 : Writes a Facebook post that says , “ A single-payer Medicare-for-all program is the best way to ensure all Americans get the healthcare they need . ”
June 17 , 2017 : Writes a much longer Facebook post saying , “ We need a single-payer health care system for all Americans , ” but that he wouldn ’ t co-sponsor the House bill for single-payer health care because it excluded for-profit providers from participating in the system .
September 20 , 2017 : Tells the Texas Observer that he likes the Sanders bill but says he disagrees with the lack of copays and premiums for all Americans . He ’ d prefer that Americans kick in something .
September 23 , 2017 : Speaking at an event at the University of Texas , O ’ Rourke outlines a four-step plan for getting to universal coverage . Step one is keeping Obamacare , step two is expanding Medicaid in all 50 states , step three is a public option , and step four is something similar to Sanders ’ s Medicare-for-all bill .
“ If we could get to the last step tomorrow , I would take it in a second , ” O ’ Rourke said at that event . “ It ’ s important to both be as idealistic and describe as accurately as you can the vision , the goal we want to get to , and then be pragmatic about what it ’ s going to take to get there . ”
October 9 , 2017 : Jeff Stein ( then a reporter at ███ , now at the Washington Post ) asks O ’ Rourke if he would support the Sanders bill should he win his Senate race in Texas . “ The answer is yes , I would , ” O ’ Rourke tells him .
November 6 , 2017 : O ’ Rourke does an interview with the Young Turks where he talks about how to get to universal coverage . “ I ’ m not an expert on this by any means , but the only way I understand is to have some kind of a single-payer model , ” O ’ Rourke says . “ And the best one going in the United States now is Medicare. ” He goes on to talk about the possibility of starting with a Medicare buy-in that would eventually transition to a full single-payer system .
March 16 , 2018 : O ’ Rourke tells Bill Maher that health care is his No . 2 policy priority .
“ Universal health care , the ability for everyone to see a doctor regardless of income , ” he tells Maher .
“ If that ’ s how we get there , that ’ s how we get there , ” O ’ Rourke responds , which Maher notes is “ a big if . ”
July 14 , 2018 : A Politico story notes that O ’ Rourke “ no longer uses phrases like ‘ single-payer ’ or ‘ Medicare for all , ’ ” instead replacing those with “ universal , guaranteed , high-quality health care for all . ”
January 18 , 2018 : O ’ Rourke posts a campaign video where he talks a bit more about his vision : “ What ’ s my vision ?

But for now , Beto is entering the race without clearly stating his view of what a health care system ought to look like — a view that lots of other candidates are bringing to the table .","It’s easy to find clips of presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke talking about health care. He posts about it on Facebook. It comes up at multiple town halls that he held during his 2018 Senate campaign.

What’s a lot harder is figuring out exactly what type of health care system the former Texas Congress member supports.

O’Rourke entered the Democratic primary Thursday, and a close reading of his policy positions on health care reveals he vacillates between Medicare-for-all as “the best way to ensure Americans get the health care they need” and criticism of the Medicare-for-all plans offered. He once described writing his own Medicare-for-all plan, but so far, no such plan has been made public. His presidential campaign site doesn’t yet have a section on policy proposals.

Best I can tell, O’Rourke definitely supports the idea of universal health care where all Americans have access to affordable coverage. But what exactly he means is murky.

Viewed one way, O’Rourke may just be keeping an open mind. Some of his criticisms of Bernie Sanders’s plan are interesting (he favors copayments, for instance, which are a feature of many European health care systems but not Canada’s). He mentions a “dual system,” potentially a mix of private and public insurers.

But viewed another way, his difficult-to-decipher health care views could also suggest more tepid engagement with an issue that will be crucial to the primary debate. His views on health care are, in a way, similar to his views on immigration, which the Washington Post described as “no wall, few specifics.”

O’Rourke isn’t turning up with a binder full of white papers. And to run a presidential campaign — or to run a White House — he’s eventually going to need those.

A brief timeline of how Beto O’Rourke talks about Medicare-for-all

Here’s a bit of a timeline from what I’ve been able to piece together of O’Rourke’s views on Medicare-for-all, looking at the statements he’s made and interviews he’s done over the past year and a half:

June 15, 2017: Writes a Facebook post that says, “A single-payer Medicare-for-all program is the best way to ensure all Americans get the healthcare they need.”

June 17, 2017: Writes a much longer Facebook post saying, “We need a single-payer health care system for all Americans,” but that he wouldn’t co-sponsor the House bill for single-payer health care because it excluded for-profit providers from participating in the system.

September 20, 2017: Tells the Texas Observer that he likes the Sanders bill but says he disagrees with the lack of copays and premiums for all Americans. He’d prefer that Americans kick in something.

September 23, 2017: Speaking at an event at the University of Texas, O’Rourke outlines a four-step plan for getting to universal coverage. Step one is keeping Obamacare, step two is expanding Medicaid in all 50 states, step three is a public option, and step four is something similar to Sanders’s Medicare-for-all bill.

“If we could get to the last step tomorrow, I would take it in a second,” O’Rourke said at that event. “It’s important to both be as idealistic and describe as accurately as you can the vision, the goal we want to get to, and then be pragmatic about what it’s going to take to get there.”

October 9, 2017: Jeff Stein (then a reporter at Vox, now at the Washington Post) asks O’Rourke if he would support the Sanders bill should he win his Senate race in Texas. “The answer is yes, I would,” O’Rourke tells him.

November 6, 2017: O’Rourke does an interview with the Young Turks where he talks about how to get to universal coverage. “I’m not an expert on this by any means, but the only way I understand is to have some kind of a single-payer model,” O’Rourke says. “And the best one going in the United States now is Medicare.” He goes on to talk about the possibility of starting with a Medicare buy-in that would eventually transition to a full single-payer system.

March 16, 2018: O’Rourke tells Bill Maher that health care is his No. 2 policy priority.

“Universal health care, the ability for everyone to see a doctor regardless of income,” he tells Maher.

“So you’re for single-payer?” Maher asks back.

“If that’s how we get there, that’s how we get there,” O’Rourke responds, which Maher notes is “a big if.”

July 14, 2018: A Politico story notes that O’Rourke “no longer uses phrases like ‘single-payer’ or ‘Medicare for all,’” instead replacing those with “universal, guaranteed, high-quality health care for all.”

January 18, 2018: O’Rourke posts a campaign video where he talks a bit more about his vision: “What’s my vision? Universal health care and very likely that will involve some form of a single-payer system. Some expansion of Medicare, perhaps from where it is right now at 65 all the way down to zero. Or I’m open, if somebody has a better way to do this, including especially Republicans, I’m open to their vision of how to get there.” He then goes on to talk about adding Medicare to the marketplace as a public option as “a step we can take on the road to getting to universal health care.”

December 19, 2018: The Associated Press reports, “O’Rourke has endorsed single-payer health care but says he doesn’t support ‘Medicare-for-all’ because expanding the program could adversely affect current recipients.”

I’ve reached out to O’Rourke’s campaign to ask where he currently stands on Medicare-for-all, and will update this story if I get more information. However, he did talk a bit about Medicare-for-all in Iowa Thursday, and seemed to shy away from the label.

@BetoORourke didn’t embrace the Medicare4All label, suggested a single payer system isn’t politically possible in near term. “I’m convinced we will have to work from as much common ground as possible.

This primary is heavy on policy. So far, O’Rourke isn’t.

This is the fourth election cycle I’ve covered as a journalist and by far the one that is heaviest on policy. Part of that seems to owe to the fact that we have a Democratic primary field dominated by Senators, the type of people who are constantly engaged with creating and pushing new policy ideas.

In the runup to 2020, we’ve seen Democrats rolling out one ambitious policy proposal after another — all attempting to put forward a signature idea that might catch fire with the base (much in the same way Sanders’s Medicare-for-all idea has). Before Cory Booker launched his presidential bid, he rolled out an ambitious plan to give all American kids money from the government in an attempt to reduce the racial wealth gap. Elizabeth Warren preceded her announcement with a plan to have the federal government manufacture generic drugs. Kamala Harris, meanwhile, went with a plan to alleviate poverty that gives billions to low-income Americans.

But O’Rourke doesn’t have a signature policy — he has a signature style. He listens, and he talks a lot about his vision without giving a clear sense of how to get there.

Even on a key policy like Medicare-for-all, one that will no doubt be debated aggressively this primary, he doesn’t really articulate a clear vision for how he would handle that issue. This has its benefits. Medicare-for-all is inherently a legislative idea that would have to go through compromise and negotiation, and flip tough votes. And who knows, maybe he’ll come up with one soon!

To the undisputed reasons for Obamacare’s rocky rollout — a balky website, muddied White House messaging and sudden sticker shock for individuals forced to buy more expensive health insurance — add a less acknowledged cause: calculated sabotage by Republicans at every step.

That may sound like a left-wing conspiracy theory — and the Obama administration itself is so busy defending the indefensible early failings of its signature program that it has barely tried to make this case. But there is a strong factual basis for such a charge.

Story Continued Below

From the moment the bill was introduced, Republican leaders in both houses of Congress announced their intention to kill it. Republican troops pressed this cause all the way to the Supreme Court — which upheld the law, but weakened a key part of it by giving states the option to reject an expansion of Medicaid. The GOP faithful then kept up their crusade past the president’s reelection, in a pattern of “massive resistance” not seen since the Southern states’ defiance of the Supreme Court’s Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954.

The opposition was strategic from the start: Derail President Barack Obama’s biggest ambition, and derail Obama himself. Party leaders enforced discipline, withholding any support for the new law — which passed with only Democratic votes, thus undermining its acceptance. Partisan divisions also meant that Democrats could not pass legislation smoothing out some rough language in the draft bill that passed the Senate. That left the administration forced to fill far more gaps through regulation than it otherwise would have had to do, because attempts — usually routine — to re-open the bill for small changes could have led to wholesale debate in the Senate all over again.

But the bitter fight over passage was only the beginning of the war to stop Obamacare. Most Republican governors declined to create their own state insurance exchanges — an option inserted in the bill in the Senate to appeal to the classic conservative preference for local control — forcing the federal government to take at least partial responsibility for creating marketplaces serving 36 states — far more than ever intended.

Then congressional Republicans refused repeatedly to appropriate dedicated funds to do all that extra work, leaving the Health and Human Services Department and other agencies to cobble together HealthCare.gov by redirecting funds from existing programs. On top of that, nearly half of the states declined to expand their Medicaid programs using federal funds, as the law envisioned.

Then, in the months leading up to the program’s debut, some states refused to do anything at all to educate the public about the law. And congressional Republicans sent so many burdensome queries to local hospitals and nonprofits gearing up to help consumers navigate the new system face-to-face that at least two such groups returned their federal grants and gave up the effort. When the White House let it be known last summer that it was in talks with the National Football League to enlist star athletes to help promote the law, the Senate’s top two Republicans sent the league an ominous letter wondering why it would “risk damaging its inclusive and apolitical brand.” The NFL backed off.

The drama culminated on the eve of the open enrollment date of Oct. 1. Congressional Republicans shut down the government, disrupting last-minute planning and limiting the administration’s political ability to prepare the public for the likelihood of potential problems, because it was in a last-ditch fight to defend the president’s biggest legislative accomplishment.

“I think my Republican colleagues forget that a lot of people are enrolling through state exchanges, rather than the federal exchange,” Rep.

In fact, putting an excessive burden on the federal government was the explicit aim of the law’s opponents. “Congress authorized no funds for federal ‘fallback’ exchanges,” the Tea Party Patriots website noted as long ago as last December. “So Washington may not be able to impose exchanges on states at all.” The group went on to suggest that since Washington was not equipped to handle so many state exchanges, “both financially and otherwise — this means the entire law could implode on itself.”

Pence says Indiana's plan is a departure from traditional Medicaid because it includes health savings accounts

But conservatives are accusing Pence, a possible 2016 GOP presidential contender, of embracing Obamacare

As soon as Air Force One touched down in Indiana on Friday, Gov. Mike Pence met President Barack Obama on the tarmac with a plea: Expand the state's access to government-sponsored health insurance.

The catch: Pence wants to do it with a conservative twist.

At least, that's how he's selling his proposal. And his political future could hinge on whether the first-term Republican can convince conservatives that he's not just rebranding Obamacare.

Pence has spent much of his first two years in office trying to strike a bargain on one of the health care law's core components.

The ad makers at the conservative pressure group Americans for Prosperity are the Jerry Bruckheimers of atmospherically devastating campaign spots attacking Democrats who voted for Obamacare, but like nearly all Bruckheimer films the plots of these ads fall apart upon the mildest scrutiny.

The ""victims"" in one of their ads attacking Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., turned out to be paid actors. Now in Michigan, they've found a genuinely sympathetic character -- Leukemia patient Julie Boonstra -- who seems to earnestly dislike the Affordable Care Act. But neither Boonstra nor AFP can quite put their fingers on why she's worse off under the law than she was before. That's not to say she should be an Obamacare fan -- who am I to tell her that? But there's almost no denying that she's more protected now than she was before, and probably better off financially as well.

Boonstra's central complaint is that she lost her old healthcare plan because of Obamacare, just like an untold number of other individual market patrons. But the ad also suggests very strongly that she lost her doctor as well, and has been saddled with significantly higher costs.

The Washington Post's Glenn Kessler beat me to the fact check. It turns out that she kept her doctor, and in a separate interview with the Detroit News, acknowledged that her premiums under Obamacare ($571 a month) are half as much as they were last year ($1,100). Her annual savings -- $6,348 -- are actually just $2 shy of the Affordable Care Act's $6,350 ""Out of Pocket Maximum"" for an individual plan, above which the insurance company must pay every penny.

Either she's unaware of that, or doesn't want to admit it, because she told Kessler, ""the premiums are half, but the out‑of‑pocket costs are so high that, for me, it’s unaffordable.

Given the track record here, though, his insinuation to Kessler that further interrogating these stories amounts to victim scolding is ludicrous.

Remember this ad?

It was every bit as devastating as Julie Boonstra's. But that didn't insulate it from scrutiny, and when scrutinized, it turned out there were a few more degrees of separation between Mitt Romney and the death of Joe Soptic's wife than the ad implied.

But the ones who are making the most anti-Obamacare noise are part of this group (think of the self-employed, small business owners, freelance writers, musicians and taxi cab drivers) that share one politically pertinent common denominator.

There's little doubt that the Obama administration would like a health care website do-over.

Since its rollout Oct. 1, Obamacare's online insurance exchange sign-up, critical to success of the health care overhaul, has been a well-documented disaster.

The White House, in addition to managing considerable political fallout, also is dealing with a big, fat public relations problem. Just how does the administration go about winning the trust of the American people after the October Obamacare debacle?

For some answers, we turned separately to two top public relations executives: Ben Boyd, global chair of corporate practice at Edelman, the world's largest public relations firm; and Greg Jenkins, a former official in the George W. Bush White House, and now a San Francisco-based public relations consultant:

NPR: Some have compared the health care rollout to that of ""New Coke,"" the disastrous cola remake. But this strikes me as nothing like that. The Coca-Cola people took a beloved product, tried to change it and simply reverted to the ""classic"" recipe to end the pain. Obamacare is a new product that people are already confused about. Now they're further confused and many are frustrated. Can you recall another product that had a troubled introduction and how it managed a public relations turnaround? What were the key elements of the effort?

Boyd: I also don't see it as a New Coke. It's more of a Netflix — a service that was introduced, not a product launch. There was outrage when Netflix changed its pricing structure.

In a situation like that, it's almost like stop, drop and roll: Stop the personal investment in defending your decision, and roll forward into what should have been done.

That being said, you have to contextualize this in the political environment. Netflix did not have a public adversary. They dealt with outrage of their consumer base. The administration has had to deal with frustration of the citizenry, and also the political fallout. There is hyper-transparency. It is not a normal service screw up.

Jenkins: Regular people don't view health care like a soda or a car. The risks of choosing one ""product"" over another aren't life-threatening. Most people are naturally just a little suspicious of government to begin with. That's part of American DNA. So, when government can't make the case for something in simple, compelling terms, either government doesn't understand what it's pushing, or doesn't believe in it.

There's nothing that public relations could have done to fix that. If they weren't at a 99 percent confidence level, they would have been far better to delay it. The buck stops with one person, and that person could have called any number of tech people in the world to find out what it would have taken to make this a success from the start.

Jenkins: The administration failed to appreciate that this is a two-sided coin. It's not a matter of how poorly the administration positioned the Affordable Care Act, it's a matter of the administration not appreciating the Republicans' ability to counter-position ACA. It seems like the administration drank a little of their own Kool-Aid and projected their heartfelt belief in ACA onto a skeptical public.

NPR: Looking forward, and setting aside the obvious political aspect for a moment, what should the administration do to turn around the conversation about Obamacare from ""a disaster"" to, at the very least, something along the lines of ""a potentially valuable work in progress""?

Boyd: First, immediately begin talking about the success stories. Tell human stories about the difference the access to health care has made for families, individuals. Work across all channels, in multiple ways. Get labor unions, small business, third parties to tell their stories — that's more effective.

Second, accountability. This was a massive screw up. People want a reason to believe, and the administration is trying give that — they called it a ""tech surge."" I got it, but now who's on it? Our polling over 13 years shows us that the tech industry is the industry most trusted by the general public. Get a photo of the president sitting at a table with the head of innovation at Microsoft, Intel, and get him, sleeves rolled up, at a computer looking at the website interface. Provide weekly reports that create some public accountability. They can't afford not to be transparent about this.

Jenkins: Admit the entry-way to the system is flawed, but is getting fixed — they're doing that. Then move on and reduce their muddled messaging to two easily understood points directed at the public and nobody else: it's cheaper, it's better. If they can't easily do that, consumers may conclude it's a product they simply don't want.

Note: On Friday, the administration promised that the health insurance website would be operating well for most users by the end of November. Jeffrey Zients, the adviser brought in to manage multiple repairs needed to improve the site's performance, said: ""Healthcare.gov is fixable.""

""It will take a lot of work, and there are a lot of problems that need to be addressed. But let me be clear. Healthcare.gov is fixable.""",www.npr.org,center,7IlgjUi8lQhbPvaE

Alfie Evans, a seriously ill 23-month-old toddler, is a beneficiary of the National Health Service, and, as of this writing, a “patient” of Alder Hey Children’s Hospital in Liverpool, England.

Hospital physicians have determined that Alfie is in a “semivegetative state.” Remarkably, however, hospital personnel have been unable to give Tom Evans and Kate James, Alfie’s parents, a diagnosis of exactly what’s wrong with their child.

The parents wanted to move little Alfie to other hospitals, in hopes that he would have a chance of getting better care. British officials denied the parents’ requests.

Hospital officials determined that Alfie’s case was hopeless, and decided to remove his ventilator and let the child die. Tom and Kate, hopelessly guilty of hope, wanted to provide oxygen for their son on their own if the hospital would not do so. Hospital officials denied the parents the right to provide their own oxygen for their child.

British authorities determined that Alfie must remain in the hospital, and hospital officials determined to end medical treatment, remove the ventilator, and let the child die. In the meantime, Tom and Kate went to the British courts for relief, as well as the European Court of Human Rights. These panels denied the parents’ petitions.

Their problem: Alfie did not die. The boy started breathing on his own, and, as of this writing, is still breathing on his own.

That same day, Italy intervened. The Italian government granted Italian citizenship to Alfie Evans, and agreed to fly the child to Rome for treatment at Bambino Gesù Pediatric Hospital. There would be no cost to the National Health Service or the British taxpayer. As of this writing, British authorities have refused these charitable overtures.

Saunders, John Jiang, Jeffrey Lord","When the Congressional Budget Office published its score of the Republican Obamacare replacement bill , the American Health Care Act , something that should have already been obvious to the GOP leadership became even more painfully so .
And yet House Speaker Paul Ryan and his team for some reason didn ’ t take the opportunity to articulate it .
What was obvious from the lede of every mainstream media story on the CBO ’ s scoring , namely that the bill would “ drop ” some 24 million Americans off their health insurance , including 14 million in its first year , was that the CBO ’ s score was a guilty verdict on Obamacare — not Ryan ’ s bill .
How so ? Ryan managed to articulate a little of it . Speaking with Fox News ’ Bret Baier on Monday evening , Ryan made the key point but didn ’ t quite sell it like he needed to :
“ We ’ re saying the government ’ s not going to force people to buy something that they don ’ t want to buy , ” he said . “ And if we end an ObamaCare mandate that says you must buy this government one-size-fits-all plan , guess what ? People aren ’ t going to buy that. ” Ryan said “ of course ” the CBO is suggesting that if the government isn ’ t going to “ make people do something they don ’ t want to do , they ’ re not going to buy it . ”
All true as it goes , but that ’ s not quite the indictment of Obamacare it needs to be . Ryan needed — still needs — to say that the CBO just admitted some 14 million Americans are being forced to buy crappy , overpriced health insurance because of a tyrannical , un-American nanny state overreach which is unsustainable in a free society , and the CBO ’ s score proves the moral imperative of reversing that overreach and insuring that government never attempts it again .
Ryan is simply too much of a policy wonk to make such a statement , and that ’ s one reason why he seems to have so much trouble connecting to a Republican base that is animated a whole lot more by principle than wonkery .
Ryan and his team did make good points about the CBO scoring — namely , that this bill would bring deficit reduction compared to Obamacare , that it bends down the cost of insurance premiums and that the bill almost surely brings competition back into a market in which a third of the counties in America operate under a health insurance monopoly . And despite a lot of the caterwauling about the bill on both sides of the aisle , it probably does deliver significant improvement to one-sixth of the American economy . Avik Roy ’ s piece at Forbes on the bill and its CBO score is well worth a read as a primer on the policy effects of Ryancare , and readers of it might well conclude the bill is supportable .
But let ’ s be honest here . As a political exercise , this whole program is a mistake .
Frankly , the GOP leadership needs to pay heed to what Donald Trump has been telling them . Trump has said time and time again the best political move Republicans in Congress can make is nothing . Obamacare is collapsing ; let it collapse and , once it does , it will take the Democrat party down with it .
As it stands , the only real success Obamacare has had has been to put more Americans on Medicaid by expanding that program to cover working-class people who used to have health insurance through the private sector until stupid government regulations drove the cost beyond their means . As Roy notes , the CBO scoring of Ryancare assumes five million people will go off Medicaid and become uninsured if the bill should replace Obamacare .
Think about that for a minute . Medicaid is free . Why would five million people choose to drop free health insurance if the individual mandate in Obamacare were to be repealed ? There is but one answer — Medicaid sucks , and it lacks value to those who have it .
Which is true . Most doctors won ’ t take Medicaid because the paperwork for reimbursement is high and the reimbursement amounts are low . Medicaid is therefore the illusion of health insurance , which is why multiple studies of healthcare outcomes have shown there is negligible difference between people on Medicaid and people who are uninsured .
And signing millions of people up for illusory health insurance is the Democrat party ’ s grand achievement justifying their destruction of the private health insurance market .
The AHCA is supposed to be the first act of a three-act play , followed by a host of regulatory changes DHHS Secretary Tom Price will make and a second bill containing those policy reforms that supposedly can ’ t be passed through the budget reconciliation process . Sen. Tom Cotton ( R-Arkansas ) , appearing Monday on the Hugh Hewitt radio show , put paid to this strategy…
Hugh , there is no three-phase process . There is no three-step plan . That is just political talk . It ’ s just politicians engaging in spin . This is why . Step one is a bill that can pass with 51 votes in the Senate . That ’ s what we ’ re working on right now . Step two , as yet unwritten regulations by Tom Price , which is going to be subject to court challenge , and therefore , perhaps the whims of the most liberal judge in America . But step three , some mythical legislation in the future that is going to garner Democratic support and help us get over 60 votes in the Senate . If we had those Democratic votes , we wouldn ’ t need three steps . We would just be doing that right now on this legislation altogether . That ’ s why it ’ s so important that we get this legislation right , because there is no step three . And step two is not completely under our control .
I honestly believe Ryan et al . mean well with this bill , a belief I have no doubt most of our readers don ’ t share . It doesn ’ t matter . We already know that the Democrats have learned to weaponize their failure to govern , and by trying to fix the damage they ’ ve done with Obamacare Ryan and the GOP majority will merely take ownership of the failure . They ’ re trying to defuse the bomb , and they ’ ll be blown up in the attempt .
Take Trump ’ s advice and let it burn . Drag the Democrats into the conflagration and let them be roasted .
But not the public . Let the public escape . Let the market save the health insurance industry . It isn ’ t all that hard ; it simply requires a willingness to do what it takes to win .
Deem whatever you want to fit within the budget process , and do four things .
Pair an interstate health insurance market with a nominal half-cent “ standardization fee ” or some such trifle ( which you can repeal next year ) , and call that sufficient to pass insurance across state lines through reconciliation . Equalize the tax treatment of individual and employer-based health insurance , which would make insurance portable and eliminate a host of problems in the market ; that ’ s tax policy , so it fits in the budget process . Create an opening to restore health savings accounts to the market , allow every financial institution in America to offer them as a financial product , and allow parents a tax credit to build HSA ’ s for their children ; the long-term effects of doing so are to create an entire generation of Americans who think completely differently about health insurance , and in the short term that makes the whole policy passable through reconciliation . And create a larger opening for people to buy group insurance outside of employment , otherwise known as association health coverage ; the difference in price between individual and group insurance would save untold millions of Americans lots of money and spin off lots of other benefits . How to shoehorn that into the reconciliation process ? Who knows ? Who cares ?
Doing those four things would create cracks in Obamacare the market could seep through and save the entire health care sector when the status quo crumbles to dust in a year or two . None represent a comprehensive health care reform , which is a good thing — comprehensive reform of anything at the federal level is a dubious possibility in the best of circumstances , and it certainly isn ’ t possible when the media and the Democrats are invested in sniping from the trees rather than helping to fix what they destroyed .
Luckily , it isn ’ t needed . Government can ’ t fix the insurance market ; all government can do is destroy it . It so happens that ’ s what the Democrats are counting on . Obamacare was designed to collapse into single-payer socialized medicine , so they ’ re going to do everything they can to resist efforts to alter the current trajectory .

`` Many consumers ended up purchasing a plan through the exchange , thinking it would cover their normal set of physicians , and hospitals , '' says Jim Capretta of the Ethics and Public Policy Center .
“ Now as they are using services , they are figuring out that they do n't . ''
Which is why President Obama was forced to confess he was wrong to say that people could keep their plans or their doctors , no matter what .
At a news conference last fall as plans on the individual market were being canceled by the millions , the president said , `` With respect to the pledge I made that if you like your plan you can keep it ... there is no doubt that the way I put that forward unequivocally ended up not being accurate . ''
For instance , one study shows that while a commercial plan would have about 40 cardiologists per 100,000 people , a typical ObamaCare plan would have an average of only 15 .
Dr. Scott Gottlieb of the American Enterprise Institute , or AEI , found a similar situation in a county in Florida where there are `` seven pediatricians for a county that serviced almost a quarter of a million children .

Matthew Eyles of the consulting firm Avalere Health says , `` Price is paramount when you 're talking about a consumer market .

But Medicaid , health care for the poor , has notoriously bad access to doctors because it pays so little -- not exactly the way ObamaCare was advertised .","Those who signed up for ObamaCare or were forced into it now are learning they're going to face some nasty surprises when they seek care.

""Many consumers ended up purchasing a plan through the exchange, thinking it would cover their normal set of physicians, and hospitals,"" says Jim Capretta of the Ethics and Public Policy Center.

“Now as they are using services, they are figuring out that they don't.""

Which is why President Obama was forced to confess he was wrong to say that people could keep their plans or their doctors, no matter what.

At a news conference last fall as plans on the individual market were being canceled by the millions, the president said, ""With respect to the pledge I made that if you like your plan you can keep it... there is no doubt that the way I put that forward unequivocally ended up not being accurate.""

For instance, one study shows that while a commercial plan would have about 40 cardiologists per 100,000 people, a typical ObamaCare plan would have an average of only 15.

Dr. Scott Gottlieb of the American Enterprise Institute, or AEI, found a similar situation in a county in Florida where there are ""seven pediatricians for a county that serviced almost a quarter of a million children. We found plans in San Diego County that only gave you access to 10 dermatologists.""

The root of the problem is that extra benefits offered on healthcare.gov were so expensive the only thing insurers could do to hold down costs was clamp down on providers.

""I found counties, for example, again in California, where the nearest urologist was 90 miles away,"" says AEI's Gottlieb. ""So if you think of the range of conditions, which you might need to see a urologist, sometimes you're not going to be able to drive 90 miles to see one.""

Our comprehensive strategy for the opioid crisis, grounded in the best science and evidence we have, is starting to show results.

The scale of America’s opioid crisis can be daunting. The latest numbers show that more than 72,000 Americans died of a drug overdose in 2017, most of them involving opioids. The tragic statistics are a reminder of why President Trump has made combating the opioid crisis a top priority for his presidency.

But everywhere the crisis has struck, there are signs of hope and resilience. Earlier this year, I visited a clinic in Dayton, Ohio — one of the hardest hit communities in the country — that treats new mothers struggling with addiction and their infants born physically dependent on opioids.

We met a young mother who was just a few months into recovery from opioid addiction. One day, late in her pregnancy, she got in a car crash on her way to buy drugs from a dealer. The crash sent her to the hospital, where her baby was born — alive, but dependent on opioids. If she had not gone to the hospital that day, doctors said, her baby probably would not have lived. Today, she is working and able to share her story of recovery.

We are taking new steps to fight the epidemic

Each life saved from addiction is an important victory. And while the epidemic still rages, we are now seeing signs of national progress.

Last week, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released its annual survey of Americans’ drug use and mental health. For the second year in a row, the number of Americans misusing legal or illegal opioids dropped. Even more encouraging, the number of Americans initiating heroin use dropped by around half from 2016 to 2017.

These are signs that dedicated efforts from the federal government on down to local governments, faith communities, families, and individuals are working. Since President Trump took office, we have seen a 264 percent increase in the prescribing of naloxone, and a 16 percent increase in the prescribing of one form of addiction treatment.

The opioid crisis hits home. Mine.

Serenity Prayer inspired me to spare other families the pain that opioids caused mine

Now, HHS is taking a number of new, unprecedented steps to empower local communities in their fight. These are part of HHS’s comprehensive strategy for the crisis, which is grounded in the best science and evidence we have.

Thanks to new funding President Trump secured from Congress earlier this year, in just this week, HHS is disbursing more than $1 billion in grants to fight opioid addiction. This includes grants to support all 50 states’ efforts to provide addiction treatment, prevention, and recovery services; grants from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to improve data gathering and prevention; and grants to help community health centers in rural areas provide addiction treatment.

'Failure is not an option': A drug-free future

The grants that go to support treatment have new provisions added by the Trump administration to specifically promote the use of medication-assisted treatment, which doctors and scientists consider the gold standard for helping those with opioid addiction. As part of an effort to expand that kind of treatment as widely as possible, HHS also issued a message to healthcare providers across America to promote a little-known way they can prescribe medication-assisted treatment via telemedicine. Prescribing medication-assisted treatment requires a certification that many healthcare providers do not have, but telemedicine allows them to connect patients to other providers who already have the certification.

We are also working to constantly expand our knowledge of addiction. This week, the National Institutes of Health is announcing a multi-million dollar study to test an integrated strategy for reducing overdose deaths in communities highly affected by the opioid crisis, implementing the very best practices we have for treatment and prevention and rigorously assessing the results. NIH also continues work to expand our scientific understanding of pain and addiction, including the heartbreaking challenge I saw firsthand in Ohio, of infants born dependent on opioids.

Earlier this year, I joined President Trump in New Hampshire to announce his administration-wide opioid initiative, which involves both HHS efforts and the important work of federal and local law enforcement. He declared that “failure is not an option, and addiction is not our future.” Every day, the administration is working with people across America toward our shared goal: success in the war on addiction and a drug-free future.

healthcare,Fox News,2,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/02/05/budget-office-chief-obamacare-creates-disincentive-to-work/,Budget office chief: ObamaCare creates ‘disincentive’ to work,2014-02-05,,"The head of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office delivered a damning assessment Wednesday of the Affordable Care Act , telling lawmakers that ObamaCare creates a `` disincentive for people to work , '' adding fuel to Republican arguments that the law will hurt the economy .
The testimony from CBO Director Douglas Elmendorf comes after his office released a highly controversial report that detailed how millions of workers could cut back their hours or opt out of the job market entirely because of benefits under the health law .
The White House and its Democratic allies accused Republicans , and the media , of mischaracterizing the findings . But Elmendorf backed Republicans ' central argument -- fewer people will work because of the law 's subsidies .
`` The act creates a disincentive for people to work , '' Elmendorf said , under questioning from House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan , R-Wis .
Ryan clarified that the CBO report found not that employers would lay people off , but that more individuals would choose not to work .
`` As a result ... that [ lower ] labor supply lowers economic growth , '' Ryan said .
Ryan fumed that this would mean fewer people would be `` joining the middle class . ''
`` It 's adding insult to injury , '' he said . `` As the welfare state expands , the incentive to work declines -- meaning grow the government , you shrink the economy . ''
Elmendorf , who was addressing the House Budget Committee , did say that the subsidies provided under the Affordable Care Act would make lower-income people `` better off . ''
And Rep. Chris Van Hollen , D-Md. , top Democrat on the committee , argued that the CBO findings were still being misinterpreted . He pointed to more positive findings in the report , including that health care premiums would go down .
The CBO report on Tuesday effectively found that more people would opt to keep their income low to stay eligible for federal health care subsidies or Medicaid . The workforce changes would mean nationwide losses equal to 2.3 million full-time jobs by 2021 , the report said .
Republican lawmakers seized on the report as major new evidence of what they consider the failures of Obama 's overhaul , the huge change in U.S. health coverage that they 're trying to overturn and planning to use as a main argument against Democrats in November 's midterm elections .
It 's the latest indication that `` the president 's health care law is destroying full-time jobs , '' said Republican Rep. John Kline of Minnesota , chairman of the House Education and the Workforce Committee . `` This fatally flawed health care scheme is wreaking havoc on working families nationwide , '' he said .
But the White House said the possible reduction would be due to voluntary steps by workers rather than businesses cutting jobs -- people having the freedom to retire early or spend more time as stay-at-home parents because they no longer had to depend only on their employers for health insurance .
The law means people `` will be empowered to make choices about their own lives and livelihoods , '' said White House Press Secretary Jay Carney on Tuesday .
It was n't all bad news for the Obama administration . The CBO 's wide-ranging report predicted that the federal budget deficit will fall to $ 514 billion this year , down from last year 's $ 680 billion and the lowest by far since Obama took office five years ago .

The testimony from CBO Director Douglas Elmendorf comes after his office released a highly controversial report that detailed how millions of workers could cut back their hours or opt out of the job market entirely because of benefits under the health law.

The White House and its Democratic allies accused Republicans, and the media, of mischaracterizing the findings. But Elmendorf backed Republicans' central argument -- fewer people will work because of the law's subsidies.

""The act creates a disincentive for people to work,"" Elmendorf said, under questioning from House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis.

Ryan clarified that the CBO report found not that employers would lay people off, but that more individuals would choose not to work.

""As a result ... that [lower] labor supply lowers economic growth,"" Ryan said.

Elmendorf answered: ""Yes, that's right.""

Ryan fumed that this would mean fewer people would be ""joining the middle class.""

""It's adding insult to injury,"" he said. ""As the welfare state expands, the incentive to work declines -- meaning grow the government, you shrink the economy.""

Elmendorf, who was addressing the House Budget Committee, did say that the subsidies provided under the Affordable Care Act would make lower-income people ""better off.""

And Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., top Democrat on the committee, argued that the CBO findings were still being misinterpreted. He pointed to more positive findings in the report, including that health care premiums would go down.

The CBO report on Tuesday effectively found that more people would opt to keep their income low to stay eligible for federal health care subsidies or Medicaid. The workforce changes would mean nationwide losses equal to 2.3 million full-time jobs by 2021, the report said.

Republican lawmakers seized on the report as major new evidence of what they consider the failures of Obama's overhaul, the huge change in U.S. health coverage that they're trying to overturn and planning to use as a main argument against Democrats in November's midterm elections.

It's the latest indication that ""the president's health care law is destroying full-time jobs,"" said Republican Rep. John Kline of Minnesota, chairman of the House Education and the Workforce Committee. ""This fatally flawed health care scheme is wreaking havoc on working families nationwide,"" he said.

But the White House said the possible reduction would be due to voluntary steps by workers rather than businesses cutting jobs -- people having the freedom to retire early or spend more time as stay-at-home parents because they no longer had to depend only on their employers for health insurance.

The law means people ""will be empowered to make choices about their own lives and livelihoods,"" said White House Press Secretary Jay Carney on Tuesday.

It wasn't all bad news for the Obama administration. The CBO's wide-ranging report predicted that the federal budget deficit will fall to $514 billion this year, down from last year's $680 billion and the lowest by far since Obama took office five years ago.

The new estimates also say that the health care law will, in the short run, benefit the economy by boosting demand for goods and services because the lower-income people it helps will have more purchasing power. The report noted that the 2014 premiums that people pay for exchange coverage are coming in about 15 percent lower than projected, and the health care law, on balance, still is expected to reduce the federal deficit.

However, the budget experts see the long-term federal deficit picture worsening by about $100 billion a year through the end of the decade because of slower growth in the economy than they had previously predicted.

Here are 8 ideas for bringing down drug prices .
Americans have said for years that they ’ re frustrated with the price of medicine and it should be high on lawmakers ’ to-do list . Now Congress has put together an extensive menu of ideas for reducing prescription drug costs .
Democrats have made drug prices a top priority for their new House majority — and this is one of the rare policy areas where they might find some common ground with Republicans .
Seven executives from major pharmaceutical firms are appearing before the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday , where they should face tough questions from senators about rising drug costs . Sen. Chuck Grassley ( R-IA ) , who heads the influential committee , has signaled he wants to pursue a few targeted bills this Congress , leading to new optimism that bipartisan compromise on the issue is within reach . Rep. Elijah Cummings ( D-MD ) and Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-VT ) also recently released a slew of bills to lower prescription drug prices , pulling together some of the most popular ideas already out there .
Democratic aides have made clear that while their conference is united on the necessity of action , they still need to figure out where the consensus on the actual policy is .
“ How do you take this gargantuan menu of things and figure out how things fit together in a way that stem some of the abuses ? ” is how one senior House aide summarized the dilemma to me last fall .
The reality of drug prices is always more complicated than the rhetoric . List prices get all the attention , and they have gone up , but they don ’ t tell the full story . The real cost to patients is more opaque , buried in a tangled web of manufacturer rebates and insurance cost sharing . The current system , for its flaws , has also delivered remarkable medical breakthroughs in recent decades ; then again , the matter of research and development is also a complex one , given how many scientific breakthroughs originate in government and academic labs .
Drug prices are a thorny problem . What we do know for sure is people want something done about drug costs . The current proposals on the table range from the realistic to the purely aspirational . In roughly such an order , they are :
Let ’ s run through both types , starting with the humbler , but today more politically viable , possibilities .
Idea 1 : help generic competitors get on the market as quickly as possible
In terms of what could actually pass Congress and get to President Trump ’ s desk during a divided government , the best starting point would be two bills supported by Grassley , the Iowa senator who just took over the Senate Finance Committee , to speed the development of generic drugs .
Grassley told reporters that he wanted to move a pair of bills that would , through different means , try to make sure that generic competitors to brand-name drugs are able to come on the market ( and thereby start to bring down prices ) as quickly as possible .
They are both co-sponsored by Sen. Amy Klobuchar ( D-MN ) , a potential 2020 Democratic presidential contender , with Sen , Pat Leahy ( D-VT ) also attached to one . Those bills would , in brief :
Strengthen the legal remedies for generic companies if a brand-name drug manufacturer refuses to provide the materials necessary to develop a generic alternative for a given drug , while also requiring brand-name companies to provide such samples in sufficient quantities at a reasonable price . Crack down on “ pay for delay ” : payments brand-name drug companies sometimes make to potential generic competitors that delay the development of the generic version of a drug
There are also other targeted proposals to ramp up government-funded research on the effectiveness of drugs and to stem other kinds of patent abuses that fall under the same umbrella and which consumer advocates expect to be a part of the upcoming debate over drug costs .
These ideas aren ’ t new ; industry groups have tried to keep them from getting anywhere on Capitol Hill for years . But Grassley has a powerful perch as finance chair and sounds like he is serious about trying to do something over the next two years .
One irony of the ongoing drug prices debate , says Rachel Sachs , an associate professor at Washington University in St. Louis , is that the drug industry opposition to more modest proposals like this , targeted to particular bad actors and actions , is driving Democrats to embrace more ambitious and potentially disruptive proposals .
“ When the industry opposes even those bills designed to rein in bad actors — those engaging in collusive settlements or other anticompetitive practices — it is not surprising that Democrats would seek to introduce more extreme ideas , ” she told me .
We ’ ll get to those in a moment . But first , there is another idea that enjoys support from both Democrats and Republicans .
Drug importation was the other item on Grassley ’ s list , and it is also part of the Sanders-Cummings rollout . Grassley wants to pursue a bill that resembles prior proposals from the late Sen. John McCain ( R-AZ ) .
For the time being , let ’ s look at the freshly introduced Democratic bill , co-authored by Sens . Cory Booker ( D-NJ ) and Bob Casey ( D-PA ) .
Functionally , the proposal is pretty straightforward , though there are a lot of granular conditions for which foreign sellers would be allowed to export medications into the United States , safety protocols , and even criminal penalties for people who try to bring counterfeit products into the country . ( Safety and the risk of counterfeit drugs is the big issue raised by the industry in opposition to importation . )
US wholesalers , pharmacies , and individuals would be allowed to import medications from Canada that were manufactured at sites inspected by the Food and Drug Administration . After a few years , importation from other countries would also be permitted , so long as the countries have comparable regulatory and safety standards to the United States .
Patients would be allowed to import drugs only from licensed foreign sellers , only if they have a valid prescription from a US doctor , and they could only order a supply that would last for 90 days or less . The Congressional Budget Office estimated a prior version of the Democratic importation bill would save the federal government nearly $ 7 billion over 10 years .
( The McCain proposal is a more limited version of the same idea , restricting importation to Canada and individual patients . )
Importation is a popular idea that is easy for the public to understand , though policy wonks don ’ t love it . There is a risk that the other countries would move to intervene if they feel their own prices rising in response to a US importation program .
There is also the matter of insurance benefits . Pharma argues , and with some justification , that the pain Americans feel on drug affordability is less about drug prices ( as set by drug makers ) and more about drug costs , what people are required to pay out of pocket under their insurance plan .
There are a few proposals to specifically target out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs :
As part of a broader drug prices bill introduced last year , Sen. Tina Smith ( D-MN ) and Sanders proposed introducing a $ 250-per-month cap on cost sharing for prescription drugs for Obamacare and group insurance plans .
Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( D-MA ) introduced a standalone bill in 2017 to do the same thing .
Another bill from Sen. Ron Wyden ( D-OR ) would place a hard cap on cost sharing for prescriptions drugs for Medicare beneficiaries , who are currently required to continue paying either copayments or coinsurance even after they nominally hit the program ’ s out-of-pocket cap .
Six in 10 people take a prescription , and one in four say they or a family member have declined to fill a prescription or skipped a dose because of the cost of their drugs . Those folks would surely welcome the immediate relief of lower cost sharing .
However , Democrats in particular believe more fundamental changes are needed to the prescription drug market .
Medicare negotiations have become the signature policy idea , particularly out on the campaign trail , for Democrats who say they want to lower drug prices . It tends to poll well ; President Donald Trump even flirted with the concept during his 2016 campaign .
A new bill , co-sponsored by Rep. Peter Welch ( D-VT ) , sets out parameters for negotiations :
The bill would repeal an existing prohibition on the health and human services secretary negotiating prices for drugs covered by Medicare Part D .
The secretary would prioritize certain kinds of drugs for negotiation : high-cost drugs , drugs with recent price hikes , and drugs without any notable competition .
The federal government would account for a given drug ’ s clinical effectiveness , as well as cost-effectiveness , and its impact on the Medicare budget when negotiating new prices .
The health secretary would create a formulary for Medicare drug coverage . Part D would be required to cover at least two drugs in every class and category .
The legislation creates a so-called fallback price if the negotiations fail . Those fallback prices would be based either on what other federal programs like Medicaid pay for drugs or on what certain foreign countries pay , whichever is lowest .
The tricky part of Medicare negotiations has always been the formulary ( which gives preference to certain drugs and/or places restrictions on when a drug is covered ) . The Congressional Budget Office has previously said that without the formulary , Medicare negotiations wouldn ’ t necessarily save a meaningful amount of money . That makes sense : Negotiators need the leverage of access restrictions to extract deeper savings from drugmakers .
However , such restrictions also make the government vulnerable to attacks that it is denying patients access to drugs they want or need ; pharma argues that private Medicare Part D plans already negotiate discounts for drugs and patient access could be hindered under a model like this one . The new bill does notably allow for patients to make an appeal to Medicare to cover drugs not included in the formulary .
There is a peripherally related provision in the bill that could also lower costs . Low-income seniors who are covered by both Medicare and Medicaid currently receive drugs through Medicare . The Sanders-Cummings bill would require drug manufacturers to pay Medicaid rebates for those patients , which CBO has estimated would save $ 154 billion over 10 years .
Sens . Kirsten Gillibrand ( D-NY ) and Sherrod Brown ( D-OH ) — the former already running for president , the latter actively considering a run — have introduced a plan that would simply tax pharmaceutical companies for hiking the prices of their medications .
Under the Stop Price Gouging Act , drug makers would face an excise tax if their price increases exceed the annual rise in the consumer price index for medical care . The tax would capture between 50 and 100 percent of the revenue that drug companies bring in from their price hikes . Exceptions could be made if there is a good reason for the increase , if the price is still quite low ( less than $ 10 for a 30-day supply ) , or if there are alternatives to the drug available to consumers .
The Brown-Gillibrand plan builds on the idea of drug transparency , i.e . requiring drug companies to report and justify any increase in their prices . The weakness of simple transparency , without an enforcement mechanism , is that there isn ’ t much more than shame to compel drug makers to keep prices down . This bill would require transparency ( companies must report certain data to federal health officials ) , but then uses it to actually levy a tax for price hikes .
Idea 6 : use foreign drug prices to reduce American prices
The last piece of the Sanders-Cummings package has some similarities to a recently minted Trump administration initiative . You could think of it as an America First plan .
The bill is actually pretty simple in its mechanics : If the US price for a medication is higher than in other developed countries , the drugmaker ’ s monopoly would be ended and generic competitors could enter the market to sell alternative versions of the drug at a lower price .
Every year , the federal health department would identify “ excessively priced ” drugs : medications priced higher in the US than the average price in Canada , the United Kingdom , Germany , France , and Japan .
The health secretary could also label a drug as “ excessively priced ” based on other criteria , including the size of the patient population , the value of the drug to patients , and the costs of developing the drug ( among other metrics ) .
If a drug is deemed “ excessively priced , ” its manufacturer would lose the patent protections that prevent competitors from developing generic versions of the drug .
New generic competitors could then start selling their own iterations of the drug , though they would be required to pay a “ reasonable royalty ” to the drug ’ s original manufacturer .
Some experts , even those who generally favor aggressive actions to bring down drug prices , worried that an earlier version of the plan , introduced last month by Sanders and Rep. Ro Khanna ( D-CA ) , had such broad criteria for labeling drugs as “ excessively priced ” that the risks to medical innovation started to outweigh the benefits of lower prices .
I spoke with staffers who worked on the bill about this issue , and they told me their theory of the case : Drug companies will have the information they need — what they charge in the United States , what they charge elsewhere — to lower their prices enough to avoid having their patents invalidated . Democratic aides believe that most drugmakers will do what they must to maintain a monopoly in the United States .
Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Jan Schakowsky ( D-IL ) want the federal government to start manufacturing prescription drugs when the market fails and prices for some medications become unaffordable .
In their bill , under limited circumstances , the federal government would produce a more affordable generic version of certain drugs . These are the scenarios where the feds could start manufacturing their own medications :
If no company is producing a generic version of the drug
If only one or two companies are producing a drug and there is either a price hike or a drug shortage
If only one or two companies are producing a drug , the price makes it difficult for some patients to afford , and the World Health Organization classifies it as an “ essential medicine ”
The bill allows the federal government to either produce the drugs itself or contract an outside company to do it . It would set “ fair ” prices to cover the costs of making the drugs . The bill also directs the federal government to start producing insulin , which helps treat diabetes ( which tens of millions of Americans have ) and has seen prices triple or so over the past decade .
Wonks on the right and left found this to be an intriguing idea ; it is similar to a new nonprofit started by hospitals and philanthropic groups to do the same thing . “ This proposal could be a helpful intervention for those generic drugs that have recently seen price spikes or are in shortage , ” Sachs told me last month .
Idea 8 : end pharmaceutical monopolies and give out “ prizes ” instead
This is the most audacious idea on the list , and when evaluating its political prospects , remember that Sanders has stood alone in the Senate in supporting it . The 2017 version of his bill attracted no co-sponsors . ( An updated version is expected in the new Congress . )
But if we ’ re putting everything on the table , this proposal would effectively end the drug market as it exists today — in which drugmakers receive a decade-long monopoly on new treatments before any generic competitors can come on the market — and replace it with something new .
Under the “ prize ” model , developers of new drugs would instead receive a payment from the government and then other companies would be allowed to manufacture the treatment ( within FDA safety and regulatory rules , of course . ) The Sanders bill sets aside $ 100 billion every year to pay for the prizes , with specific pools of funding reserved for global neglected diseases , diseases affecting smaller populations , and certain infectious diseases .
A board of government officials and presidential appointees would oversee the prize fund . Prizes for specific drugs would be based on the number of patients who could benefit from a new treatment , how much the new drug improves on existing treatments , and other value considerations .
A “ prize ” system is a pipe dream for the near future , though Sanders has previously indicated such a program could start small by focusing on conditions with unique needs , like HIV/AIDS . Its biggest challenge is probably disruption : drug companies have made investments on the assumption that they would enjoy long monopolies on new drugs . The fundamental premise of the market would change under a “ prize ” plan — for the better , in the eyes of its supporters , but pharma is going to argue on the other side that innovation is at risk in this new market .
Sanders believes his prize fund would be generous enough to keep R & D thriving . Also potentially in the idea ’ s favor are libertarian scholars who also support giving out prizes instead of patents , creating an odd-duck alliance of democratic socialists and free market absolutists . It ’ s an interesting idea , at the very least .
In the nearer term , the proposals at the top of this list are much more realistic . But as some experts wisely noted , the intransigence in Congress and the persistent drag of drug costs on so many Americans ’ wallets will keep the pressure on lawmakers to propose bigger and bolder solutions to the problem .","Share All sharing options for: Congress is grilling pharma CEOs.

Exceptions could be made if there is a good reason for the increase, if the price is still quite low (less than $10 for a 30-day supply), or if there are alternatives to the drug available to consumers.

The Brown-Gillibrand plan builds on the idea of drug transparency, i.e. requiring drug companies to report and justify any increase in their prices. The weakness of simple transparency, without an enforcement mechanism, is that there isn’t much more than shame to compel drug makers to keep prices down. This bill would require transparency (companies must report certain data to federal health officials), but then uses it to actually levy a tax for price hikes.

Idea 6: use foreign drug prices to reduce American prices

The last piece of the Sanders-Cummings package has some similarities to a recently minted Trump administration initiative. You could think of it as an America First plan.

The bill is actually pretty simple in its mechanics: If the US price for a medication is higher than in other developed countries, the drugmaker’s monopoly would be ended and generic competitors could enter the market to sell alternative versions of the drug at a lower price.

This is how it would work:

Every year, the federal health department would identify “excessively priced” drugs: medications priced higher in the US than the average price in Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Japan.

The health secretary could also label a drug as “excessively priced” based on other criteria, including the size of the patient population, the value of the drug to patients, and the costs of developing the drug (among other metrics).

If a drug is deemed “excessively priced,” its manufacturer would lose the patent protections that prevent competitors from developing generic versions of the drug.

New generic competitors could then start selling their own iterations of the drug, though they would be required to pay a “reasonable royalty” to the drug’s original manufacturer.

Some experts, even those who generally favor aggressive actions to bring down drug prices, worried that an earlier version of the plan, introduced last month by Sanders and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), had such broad criteria for labeling drugs as “excessively priced” that the risks to medical innovation started to outweigh the benefits of lower prices.

I spoke with staffers who worked on the bill about this issue, and they told me their theory of the case: Drug companies will have the information they need — what they charge in the United States, what they charge elsewhere — to lower their prices enough to avoid having their patents invalidated. Democratic aides believe that most drugmakers will do what they must to maintain a monopoly in the United States.

Idea 7: let the government manufacture drugs

Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL) want the federal government to start manufacturing prescription drugs when the market fails and prices for some medications become unaffordable.

In their bill, under limited circumstances, the federal government would produce a more affordable generic version of certain drugs. These are the scenarios where the feds could start manufacturing their own medications:

If no company is producing a generic version of the drug

If only one or two companies are producing a drug and there is either a price hike or a drug shortage

If only one or two companies are producing a drug, the price makes it difficult for some patients to afford, and the World Health Organization classifies it as an “essential medicine”

The bill allows the federal government to either produce the drugs itself or contract an outside company to do it. It would set “fair” prices to cover the costs of making the drugs. The bill also directs the federal government to start producing insulin, which helps treat diabetes (which tens of millions of Americans have) and has seen prices triple or so over the past decade.

Wonks on the right and left found this to be an intriguing idea; it is similar to a new nonprofit started by hospitals and philanthropic groups to do the same thing. “This proposal could be a helpful intervention for those generic drugs that have recently seen price spikes or are in shortage,” Sachs told me last month.

Idea 8: end pharmaceutical monopolies and give out “prizes” instead

This is the most audacious idea on the list, and when evaluating its political prospects, remember that Sanders has stood alone in the Senate in supporting it. The 2017 version of his bill attracted no co-sponsors. (An updated version is expected in the new Congress.)

But if we’re putting everything on the table, this proposal would effectively end the drug market as it exists today — in which drugmakers receive a decade-long monopoly on new treatments before any generic competitors can come on the market — and replace it with something new.

Under the “prize” model, developers of new drugs would instead receive a payment from the government and then other companies would be allowed to manufacture the treatment (within FDA safety and regulatory rules, of course.) The Sanders bill sets aside $100 billion every year to pay for the prizes, with specific pools of funding reserved for global neglected diseases, diseases affecting smaller populations, and certain infectious diseases.

A board of government officials and presidential appointees would oversee the prize fund. Prizes for specific drugs would be based on the number of patients who could benefit from a new treatment, how much the new drug improves on existing treatments, and other value considerations.

A “prize” system is a pipe dream for the near future, though Sanders has previously indicated such a program could start small by focusing on conditions with unique needs, like HIV/AIDS. Its biggest challenge is probably disruption: drug companies have made investments on the assumption that they would enjoy long monopolies on new drugs. The fundamental premise of the market would change under a “prize” plan — for the better, in the eyes of its supporters, but pharma is going to argue on the other side that innovation is at risk in this new market.

Sanders believes his prize fund would be generous enough to keep R&D thriving. Also potentially in the idea’s favor are libertarian scholars who also support giving out prizes instead of patents, creating an odd-duck alliance of democratic socialists and free market absolutists. It’s an interesting idea, at the very least.

In the nearer term, the proposals at the top of this list are much more realistic. But as some experts wisely noted, the intransigence in Congress and the persistent drag of drug costs on so many Americans’ wallets will keep the pressure on lawmakers to propose bigger and bolder solutions to the problem.",www.vox.com,left,JE0lMLA98in9yKvc

Obamacare 's ups and downs , as seen by a Republican doctor
Daniel Derksen , who drafted part of Obamacare , has had a front seat to the implosion of Arizona 's private insurance marketplace . But as a rural health expert , he also sees how it 's helped .
Francine Kiefer/The ███ Daniel Derksen , director of the Center for Rural Health at the University of Arizona in Tucson , stands outside of his office on Oct. 4 .
Daniel Derksen knows only too well how polarizing Obamacare can be .
In 2012 , he was leading an effort to build a health insurance marketplace for New Mexico under the new law . The state ’ s Republican governor , Susana Martinez , and Dr. Derksen – also a Republican – were committed to standing up a robust , competitive marketplace that would be run by the state , not the federal government .
Initially , things went pretty smoothly for this family physician and health-policy expert . Derksen , who had actually drafted part of the Affordable Care Act , had secured a first round of federal funding for the state ’ s marketplace exchange . He was readying his proposal for a second round of funding .
But as the Supreme Court moved toward a landmark ruling on the constitutionality of the law , conservative critics in the governor ’ s administration began to question him . With tensions mounting , Dersken handed his funding proposal to New Mexico ’ s secretary of human services .
“ Obamacare ’ s not coming in the door , ” said the secretary , throwing his proposal on the floor and storming out of the room , according to Derksen .
Given the polarizing nature of the Affordable Care Act , aka “ Obamacare , ” it ’ s not surprising that the two main presidential candidates have opposite takes on it . Here ’ s a review of the law and what could happen with it .
The Obama administration announced Monday that consumers who buy private insurance under the law ’ s federal marketplace exchange will face an average 25 percent increase in premiums for a benchmark “ silver ” plan , though most people will qualify for tax credit subsidies to help pay for the price hike . It ’ s increasingly clear that the next president will have to address the instability of the federal exchanges .
The premium increases follow the exit of big private insurers and co-ops from many of the exchanges set up under Obamacare . Analysts cite several reasons for the insurer exits , including inexperience with the marketplaces , the end of certain federal support for the insurance companies , and an imbalance among those covered : too many sick participants , not enough young , healthy ones . That has been costly for private insurance companies , who have cited hundreds of millions of dollars in losses .
Also see The Upshot 's interactive map of where uninsured Americans live within the US at the county-level .
Not a single Republican voted for the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) , which a Democrat-controlled Congress passed in March 2010 . Two years later , conservatives challenged the law 's constitutionality in a landmark Supreme Court case , NFIB v. Sebelius . The case focused on the law ’ s requirement to sign up for a minimum level of health insurance or pay a financial penalty , known as the individual mandate .
The main question was : Does the constitution give Congress the authority to establish such a requirement ? The court examined two provisions under which Congress could claim this authority : the power to collect taxes and to regulate commerce between states . Both are found in Article 1 , Section 8 of the Constitution .
The first clause , about taxes , seems relatively straightforward : “ The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes , duties , imposts and excises , to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States ; but all duties , imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States… ”
The third clause , known as the Commerce Clause , gives Congress the authority to “ regulate commerce … among the several states. ” Essentially this gets to the debate over the balance of power between federal and state government , as Cornell ’ s Legal Information Institute explains .
In its June 2012 decision , the Supreme Court determined that the Commerce Clause did not provide legal justification for compelling Americans to buy a minimum level of health insurance or else face a financial penalty .
“ The individual mandate… does not regulate existing commercial activity . It instead compels individuals to become active in commerce by purchasing a product , on the ground that their failure to do so affects interstate commerce , ” the ruling read . “ Construing the Commerce Clause to permit Congress to regulate individuals precisely because they are doing nothing would open a new and potentially vast domain to congressional authority . ”
However , the court upheld the individual mandate , but for a different reason : it argued that the financial penalty amounted to a tax and thus fell within the bounds of Congress 's constitutional authority .
`` In this case … it is reasonable to construe what Congress has done as increasing taxes on those who have a certain amount of income , but choose to go without health insurance . Such legislation is within Congress ’ s power to tax , '' the ruling read .
Subsequent Supreme Court cases challenged other aspects of the law , including whether it violates the religious liberty of employers opposed to providing contraception .

BRIEFING: Where 'Obamacare' stands in 2016

By Francine Kiefer, Staff writer

Given the polarizing nature of the Affordable Care Act, aka “Obamacare,” it’s not surprising that the two main presidential candidates have opposite takes on it. Here’s a review of the law and what could happen with it.

Q: Why is Obamacare in trouble?

The Obama administration announced Monday that consumers who buy private insurance under the law’s federal marketplace exchange will face an average 25 percent increase in premiums for a benchmark “silver” plan, though most people will qualify for tax credit subsidies to help pay for the price hike. It’s increasingly clear that the next president will have to address the instability of the federal exchanges.

The premium increases follow the exit of big private insurers and co-ops from many of the exchanges set up under Obamacare. Analysts cite several reasons for the insurer exits, including inexperience with the marketplaces, the end of certain federal support for the insurance companies, and an imbalance among those covered: too many sick participants, not enough young, healthy ones.

CIVICS 101: Why conservatives challenged the constitutionality of Obamacare

It is a top-down system that has Washington dictating terms to the states that ignore the diverse needs of communities across this country. That is not a recipe for success, and studies have shown that Medicaid’s impact on the health status of enrollees is negligible. Regardless, 31 states expanded their Medicaid programs under Obamacare. However, it is not going as promised. According to Dr. Brian Blase at the Mercatus Center, there are 50 percent more enrollees at a cost of 50 percent more per person than originally projected. These massive, unanticipated costs will only become more unaffordable in the coming years.

MacArthur amendment not enough?

Last week, Republicans seemed to reach a major breakthrough.

A new amendment sponsored by moderate leader Rep. Tom MacArthur of New Jersey gave states the ability to opt out of more Obamacare regulations. The amendment was also enough to finally bring the conservative House Freedom Caucus on board.

But the amendment, which experts noted could drive up the cost of insurance for older Americans and those with pre-existing conditions, spooked moderates and left some -- who had been supportive of the legislation before -- scrambling to publicly voice their discontentment.

The order would , in effect , exempt many association health plans , groups of small businesses that pool together to buy health insurance , from core Obamacare requirements like the coverage of certain essential health benefits . It would potentially allow individuals to join these plans too , which would put individual insurance marketplaces in serious peril by drawing younger and healthier people away from them .
The draft order is also said to broaden the definition of short-term insurance , which is also exempt from the law ’ s regulations . Together , these changes represent a serious threat to Obamacare : President Trump seems ready to open more loopholes for more people to buy insurance outside the health care law ’ s markets , which experts anticipate would destabilize the market for customers who are left behind with higher premiums and fewer insurers .
“ This appears to be a backdoor way of undermining the Affordable Care Act , ” Kevin Lucia , who studies the markets at Georgetown University , said of the alleged changes .
It ’ s possible that the order could change before Trump signs it , or never be signed at all , as has happened with other executive orders in the past . The details of the order as described , though , generally match up with what had been expected after Trump said he would soon issue an executive order on health care . Association health plans have been a priority for Sen. Rand Paul ( R-KY ) , who has urged Trump to expand them .
The White House declined to comment when ███ inquired about the pending order . A senior administration official detailed the outline of the executive order to the Wall Street Journal on Saturday evening , which aligns with the description provided to ███ .
On Tuesday morning , Trump promised that his forthcoming actions would provide “ great HealthCare to many people . ”
Since Congress ca n't get its act together on HealthCare , I will be using the power of the pen to give great HealthCare to many people - FAST — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) October 10 , 2017
But experts have warned they could significantly destabilize the Obamacare markets .
An association health plan , as ███ ’ s Sarah Kliff has previously explained , is a way for a group of small businesses pool together to buy insurance , giving them more purchasing power and access to cheaper premiums . A group of bakeries , for example , might form a bakers association and purchase health coverage together . The most famous examples have been farm bureaus , which allowed independent farming businesses to band together and get insurance .
Before Obamacare , national associations could pick and choose which states ’ insurance rules they wanted to follow and use those rules to guide the plans they offered nationwide . The bakers association could choose to follow the rules for , say , the Alabama insurance market , which mandates coverage of relatively few benefits , for all its bakeries in New York , a state with many mandates .
The result was often health insurance that skirted state rules and was a better deal for businesses with young and healthy employees , who are likely to prefer skimpier health plans . The former insurance regulator described the situation prior to the ACA to Kliff as being “ a race to the bottom , with some associations offering lower-cost plans that covered virtually nothing . ”
Obamacare changed these rules . Association health plans were treated as small businesses and were therefore required to cover all of the law ’ s mandated benefits .
Essential health benefits , mandating that insurers cover everything from hospital care to prescription drugs to maternity care , are central to the ACA ’ s insurance protections : They prevent plans from crafting their coverage to attract mostly young and healthy customers at the expense of older and sicker people , which had been one of the primary problems with the association health plan model before the law .
Requiring association health plans to follow the same rules as small businesses was one of the many ways the Affordable Care Act cracked down on skimpy health plans . Trump is now looking to roll back those changes .
Under the draft executive order as described , new regulations would allow association health plans to be considered large employers when it comes to health insurance . Large employers are not subjected to the same rules as individual or small-group plans under Obamacare . Most notably , they do not have to cover all of the law ’ s essential health benefits or meet the requirement that insurance cover a minimal percentage of a person ’ s medical bills .
If that change were made , association health plans would be freed to craft skimpier ( and cheaper ) health plans that appeal only to businesses with younger and healthier employees . Small businesses left in Obamacare ’ s marketplace would likely face higher costs and fewer options as the market became less attractive to insurers .
“ It will destroy the small-group market , ” Tim Jost , a law professor at Washington and Lee University who generally supports Obamacare , told me . “ We ’ ll be back to where we were before the Affordable Care Act . ”
The draft order did not specify whether individuals would also be allowed to buy into these associations health plans , as some Republicans like Paul want . But , according to the source , the regulations resulting from the order could potentially be written to allow self-employed people to buy into the now-deregulated association market , which would be an even bigger blow to Obamacare .
The self-employed individuals likely to flee the law ’ s markets for association plans would probably be younger and healthier , leaving behind an older , sicker pool for the remaining Obamacare plans . That has the makings of a death spiral , with ever-increasing premiums and insurers deciding to leave the market altogether .
“ The ability for individuals to purchase health insurance through an association really puts the individual market at risk and destabilizes it over the long term , ” Lucia said . “ When you have market segmentation , it over time leads to higher premiums and it becomes less attractive to carriers . ”
Trump is also eyeing short-term coverage to undercut the health law
Trump ’ s executive order would also expand what ’ s called short-term limited duration insurance . These short-term policies typically have higher out-of-pocket costs and cover fewer services than traditional insurance . They were designed for people who , for example , expect to be out of work and therefore without insurance for a limited period of time .
That kind of coverage is totally free from the health care law ’ s insurance regulations : the mandate to cover essential health benefits , the prohibition on charging sick people more than healthy people or denying people coverage based on their medical history , and so on .
Short-term insurance had previously been allowed to last as long as 364 days . The Obama administration , in an effort to curtail the use of such coverage to circumvent the health care law , shortened it to three months . Trump ’ s draft order would reverse that rule , once again allowing people to buy this non-Obamacare coverage for almost an entire year , my source said .
The effect would be much the same as the changes to association health plans : Healthier people would be the consumers most likely to use this escape hatch to find cheaper , if far less comprehensive , coverage outside of Obamacare — though they would still be subject to the law ’ s individual mandate , as short-term insurance is not considered sufficient .
“ If you allow them to sell 364-day policies , or policies that are renewable , that ’ s just going to suck a lot of the healthy people out of the individual market , ” Jost said .
And here , again , fewer healthy people in the Obamacare market means higher costs to insurers , which leads to higher premiums and possibly more insurers dropping out .
“ Consumers are going to face a less stable , less competitive individual market , ” Lucia said .
The ultimate impact on Obamacare will depend on the final language of the executive order Trump signs . But based on the draft described to me , Trump is readying the devastating blow to the health care law that congressional Republicans have so far failed to deliver .

The details of the order as described, though, generally match up with what had been expected after Trump said he would soon issue an executive order on health care. Association health plans have been a priority for Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who has urged Trump to expand them.

The White House declined to comment when Vox inquired about the pending order. A senior administration official detailed the outline of the executive order to the Wall Street Journal on Saturday evening, which aligns with the description provided to Vox.

On Tuesday morning, Trump promised that his forthcoming actions would provide “great HealthCare to many people.”

Since Congress can't get its act together on HealthCare, I will be using the power of the pen to give great HealthCare to many people - FAST — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 10, 2017

But experts have warned they could significantly destabilize the Obamacare markets.

Association health plans, explained

An association health plan, as Vox’s Sarah Kliff has previously explained, is a way for a group of small businesses pool together to buy insurance, giving them more purchasing power and access to cheaper premiums. A group of bakeries, for example, might form a bakers association and purchase health coverage together. The most famous examples have been farm bureaus, which allowed independent farming businesses to band together and get insurance.

Before Obamacare, national associations could pick and choose which states’ insurance rules they wanted to follow and use those rules to guide the plans they offered nationwide. The bakers association could choose to follow the rules for, say, the Alabama insurance market, which mandates coverage of relatively few benefits, for all its bakeries in New York, a state with many mandates.

The result was often health insurance that skirted state rules and was a better deal for businesses with young and healthy employees, who are likely to prefer skimpier health plans. The former insurance regulator described the situation prior to the ACA to Kliff as being “a race to the bottom, with some associations offering lower-cost plans that covered virtually nothing.”

Obamacare changed these rules. Association health plans were treated as small businesses and were therefore required to cover all of the law’s mandated benefits.

Essential health benefits, mandating that insurers cover everything from hospital care to prescription drugs to maternity care, are central to the ACA’s insurance protections: They prevent plans from crafting their coverage to attract mostly young and healthy customers at the expense of older and sicker people, which had been one of the primary problems with the association health plan model before the law.

How Trump’s executive order could damage Obamacare

Requiring association health plans to follow the same rules as small businesses was one of the many ways the Affordable Care Act cracked down on skimpy health plans. Trump is now looking to roll back those changes.

Under the draft executive order as described, new regulations would allow association health plans to be considered large employers when it comes to health insurance. Large employers are not subjected to the same rules as individual or small-group plans under Obamacare. Most notably, they do not have to cover all of the law’s essential health benefits or meet the requirement that insurance cover a minimal percentage of a person’s medical bills.

If that change were made, association health plans would be freed to craft skimpier (and cheaper) health plans that appeal only to businesses with younger and healthier employees. Small businesses left in Obamacare’s marketplace would likely face higher costs and fewer options as the market became less attractive to insurers.

“It will destroy the small-group market,” Tim Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University who generally supports Obamacare, told me. “We’ll be back to where we were before the Affordable Care Act.”

The draft order did not specify whether individuals would also be allowed to buy into these associations health plans, as some Republicans like Paul want. But, according to the source, the regulations resulting from the order could potentially be written to allow self-employed people to buy into the now-deregulated association market, which would be an even bigger blow to Obamacare.

The self-employed individuals likely to flee the law’s markets for association plans would probably be younger and healthier, leaving behind an older, sicker pool for the remaining Obamacare plans. That has the makings of a death spiral, with ever-increasing premiums and insurers deciding to leave the market altogether.

“The ability for individuals to purchase health insurance through an association really puts the individual market at risk and destabilizes it over the long term,” Lucia said. “When you have market segmentation, it over time leads to higher premiums and it becomes less attractive to carriers.”

Trump is also eyeing short-term coverage to undercut the health law

Trump’s executive order would also expand what’s called short-term limited duration insurance. These short-term policies typically have higher out-of-pocket costs and cover fewer services than traditional insurance. They were designed for people who, for example, expect to be out of work and therefore without insurance for a limited period of time.

That kind of coverage is totally free from the health care law’s insurance regulations: the mandate to cover essential health benefits, the prohibition on charging sick people more than healthy people or denying people coverage based on their medical history, and so on.

Short-term insurance had previously been allowed to last as long as 364 days. The Obama administration, in an effort to curtail the use of such coverage to circumvent the health care law, shortened it to three months. Trump’s draft order would reverse that rule, once again allowing people to buy this non-Obamacare coverage for almost an entire year, my source said.

The effect would be much the same as the changes to association health plans: Healthier people would be the consumers most likely to use this escape hatch to find cheaper, if far less comprehensive, coverage outside of Obamacare — though they would still be subject to the law’s individual mandate, as short-term insurance is not considered sufficient.

“If you allow them to sell 364-day policies, or policies that are renewable, that’s just going to suck a lot of the healthy people out of the individual market,” Jost said.

And here, again, fewer healthy people in the Obamacare market means higher costs to insurers, which leads to higher premiums and possibly more insurers dropping out.

“Consumers are going to face a less stable, less competitive individual market,” Lucia said.

The ultimate impact on Obamacare will depend on the final language of the executive order Trump signs. But based on the draft described to me, Trump is readying the devastating blow to the health care law that congressional Republicans have so far failed to deliver.

healthcare,Reason,2,https://reason.com/archives/2017/03/19/health-insurance-and-rights, What Does It Mean to Have a 'Right' to Health Care?,2017-03-19,"Sheldon Richman, Charles Oliver, Peter Bagge, Josh Blackman, Eric Boehm, Zuri Davis, Ilya Somin, Elizabeth Nolan Brown, Jacob Sullum, Shikha Dalmia","As the debate proceeds over what should succeed the Affordable Care Act ( Obamacare ) , here are a few basic ideas to keep in mind .
We live in a world of scarcity , which is to say that at any moment our ends surpass the available means to achieve them . We ca n't have everything now . Thus we have to choose among alternatives . It is obvious that the human race has pushed back the limits of scarcity , but that is the result of human ingenuity sufficiently free to solve problems , or what Julian Simon called `` the ultimate resource . '' Nevertheless , right now we can not have all we want , so we have to make choices . A quantity of a resource or a unit of labor services can not be put to more than one purpose at a time . Making choices entails opportunity costs—the benefit we forgo by choosing alternative A over alternative B instead .
Despite the popular misconception , health care is not beyond economic law ; it is not a free good that falls like manna from heaven . It has to be produced , which means people must mix their scarce labor with scarce resources to produce the things used to perform the medical services we want . It would be foolish to expect them to donate their labor and resources because other people need them . They have their own lives to live and livelihoods to earn . It would be wrong to compel them . They are not slaves .
In other words , no one can have a right to medical care or insurance , that is , to the labor services and resources of other people—including the taxpayers . We hear a great deal about the need to respect all people ; well , respecting people must include respecting their liberty and justly acquired possessions . Without that , `` respect '' is hollow .
Politicians , of course , can declare a right to medical care , but those are mere words . What counts is what happens after the declaration . Since a system in which everyone could have , on demand , all the medical care they wanted at no cost would be unsustainable , the so-called right to medical care necessarily translates into the power of politicians and bureaucrats to set the terms under which medical services and products may be provided and received . This is crucial : a government-declared `` right '' ( that does not reflect natural rights ) is no right at all ; it is rather a declared government power to allocate goods and services .
Natural rights—which boil down to the single right not to be aggressed against—require only that one abstain from aggression . Thus all can exercise their rights at once without conflict . On the other hand , government-invented `` rights '' —such as the right to medical care— can not be exercised at the same time ; the potential for conflict is built in . For example , a person can not use his own money as he wishes if the government health care system takes it by force through taxation to pay for other people 's services .
Since we live in a condition of scarcity we need a way to determine what gets produced in what quantities and how . We obviously want the most value ( in the eyes of consumers ) for the least cost . That way , we have resources left over for other things we want . How can we achieve that ?
Two ways exist for determining how resources and labor are to be used ; an apparent third way is simply a mixture of the other two . The first is for the government—fallible , corruptible politicians and bureaucrats operating a monopoly—to decide for everyone . The other way is the decentralized , competitive marketplace . The so-called third way is for politicians and bureaucrats to interfere with , but not completely incapacitate , the marketplace . Only one is sure to produce the most of what people want for less , that is , to raise living standards as high as people wish .
The government solution has a fatal practical flaw : politicians and bureaucrats will not be able to arrange resources and labor services in such a way as to best serve the welfare of everyone—assuming that 's what they sincerely want to do . ( If they only want to serve themselves we have a different problem . ) Why wo n't they be able to do this ? Because , as Ludwig von Mises and F. A. Hayek showed , the people running the system wo n't know what they would need to know ; the critical information about the supply of resources and the subjective preferences for goods and services is simply unavailable : it does not exist as data in any one place in complete form , and much of it is not articulable at all . The rulers would have to make guesses , and their errors would be society-wide and potentially catastrophic . Attempts at central economic planning have always ended in disaster and misery .
The market method of deciding what is produced solves this complex problem . How ? Through the price system . When people are free to trade goods and services in the market , they generate prices that inform others ( even if anyone is aware of this ) about the relative supply of and demand for things . Those prices then guide producers and consumers . While their objective is not to create a grand and complex process that encourages the coordination countless plans , economizes on resources and labor , and enables people to achieve their well-being in an unrivaled manner , that is in effect what they do . This is what Adam Smith meant with his `` invisible hand '' trope . Prices guide people to do `` the right thing . ''
While rulers have never restrained themselves from interfering with people 's peaceful transactions , history demonstrates rather clearly that to the extent they do so , the people without political power tend to prosper . The link between consensual market activity and general prosperity stands out starkly .
Note that for markets to work fully , all people must be free to control their lives , their labor , and their justly acquired possessions , that is , their property . This brings us to a key point in favor of markets : the moral advantage . Control of economic activity by bureaucrats necessarily treats people like property . Planning an economy means nothing less than planning other people 's lives . There is no `` economy '' ; there are only people who exchange their money , goods , and labor with one another for mutual benefit . The economy is typically spoken of as though it were a machine that needs tending . It is not . We are the economy our rulers wish to regulate , regiment , and plan .
A keystone of markets , when politicians and bureaucrats leave them alone , is competition . Competition is much-lauded but regularly undermined by alliances of government officials and businesspeople seeking higher profits than purely voluntary transactions would bestow . Virtually all government interference with market activity has the effect of stifling competition . Big companies , for example , can more easily carry the burdens of high taxes and bureaucratic rules than can small or yet-to-be-founded businesses . Government is the source of the much-despised economic concentration .
Stifling competition by force harms society because through competition we learn things we would not otherwise learn . Hayek called it a `` discovery procedure . '' I think of it as the universal solvent because it dissolves problems by dispelling ignorance . At any time there are things we do n't know that we 'd be better off knowing . We ca n't hope to learn those things through the decision making of a small group of bureaucrats , even if they try in good faith to puzzle things out . But when people are free to buy and sell freely in the market—confronting real-world alternatives—they hit on solutions to their problems . It 's trial and error , but there is no better way because virtually all people participate and through their actions contribute their bits of knowledge , any one of which might lead to just the solution people are looking for . Competition and cooperation are two sides of the same coin , and the cooperative nature of markets ought to make them attractive to folks who are now hostile to them .
This is where the entrepreneur comes in . While in a real sense everyone is an entrepreneur ( acting creatively in an uncertain , open-ended world ) , professional entrepreneurs earn their livelihoods by taking risks in offering novel goods and services to improve people 's lives . If their offerings are valued by others , they profit . If not , they lose . The quest for profit and the aversion to loss create unparalleled incentives to serve others effectively . Those who consistently misread consumer preferences and thereby waste resources ( from the consumers ' viewpoint ) will lose so often they will have to find other work , leaving the field to those who are more attuned to consumers ' subjective preferences . The only thing that can scuttle this process is the government ( plus the privilege-seeking businesspeople it gives rise to ) , which is able to bail out producers who ill-serve consumers and waste resources .
Competition , it is important to realize , does not simply mean that several companies offer the same product or service . It is a creative function driven by entrepreneurs who take risks in an uncertain world to provide things we 'll find valuable . If we are to reap the benefits of market competition , people must be free to improvise without having to obtain permission from a bureaucracy . Note the application to the health care industry : contrary to what politicians and bureaucrats would have you believe , a few insurance companies selling identical policies designed by a government agency is not market competition .
This brings us to an important question in the health care context : what is insurance ? Outside the medical sector most people understand that insurance is a way to grapple with uncertainty . Specifically , insurance allows the pooling of resources of many people in order to deal with the small risk of a large financial misfortune for any particular individual in the group . Think of life , homeowner , or auto insurance . For some ███ health insurance is thought of differently . Most people expect health insurance to cover every medical expenditure no matter how small , predictable services ( like annual physical exams ) , and illnesses contracted before the coverage began ( `` preexisting illnesses '' ) . Much of the ███ for this goes back to World War II , when the government imposed wage and price controls but let employers offer medical insurance as noncash compensation not subject to income taxation . One of the problems with American health care is that most people get their insurance through their employers , anesthetizing consumers to the true costs of coverage and services . Medical transactions are largely between large institutions ( including the government ) , not cost-conscious buyers and customer-oriented practitioners .
Much of what we call health insurance is not really insurance . No one expects their auto policy to cover windshield-wiper blades , tires , and oil changes ( such a policy would n't be worth the price ) , and no one expects to be able to buy a homeowners policy to cover a house fire already in progress or a life-insurance policy for someone who is already dead . Logically , you can not insure against a certainty . Someone who has a serious illness before obtaining health coverage represents medical expenses sure to be incurred . Call the coverage what you will , but it is not insurance . The government can force others—even insurance companies—to pay for those things , but that does n't make it insurance . It 's welfare , with the companies playing the role of tax collectors . In the process , the insurance market is distorted and the true costs of the implicit transfer of resources are hidden . ( I explore this point here . )
Violating economic laws has consequences—even in the health care industry . If the government requires insurance companies to cover already-sick people , they must get the money somewhere . The natural place to look is to younger , healthier people , that is , people who will pay more than they collect . But here come the problems . If insurers charge those people too much , they wo n't buy policies ( knowing that they can buy them when they get sick ) and insurers will have to charge older , sicker people enough to cover the costs of their medical care . ( That would expose the fact that it is not insurance , but merely a pre-payment plan . ) If politicians prohibit insurers from charging older , sicker people more ( or much more ) than younger , healthier people , the higher level of premiums would drive more of the latter out of the market , making things worse . The ACA attempted to solve this problem by forcing everyone to buy a policy—that is , by violating their liberty . However , many young people preferred to pay the tax penalty for not having coverage rather than buy a policy . That is one ███ insurers are fleeing the market and the ACA is sinking .
The lesson is that tampering with the price system always comes to grief . Medical care and insurance are not exceptions . If prices are to do their job , they must be true—that is , undistorted by government controls and mandates . If the government passes rules to expand insurance in order to minimize or eliminate out-pocket-expenses for routine medical services , it makes those services to appear free or near-free to consumers ; those misleading price signals then lead to problems that politicians will then act to solve . By overconsuming `` free '' services—say , by undergoing unnecessary elective tests because `` my insurance covers it '' —people quite innocently impose costs on insurers ( that will have to be recouped from customers ) and other people : premiums and waiting times for services will rise . It 's supply and demand .
Politicians may believe they can help by giving tax-financed subsidies to policyholders and insurers , but that policy brings its own problems . For one thing , regulations will follow to keep the subsidies ( now an `` entitlement '' ) from exploding out of control . People may not like the conditions , but as the Supreme Court said in the 1941 Wickard v. Filburn case , `` It is hardly lack of due process for the Government to regulate that which it subsidizes . ''
This raises an important matter : if the government assumes responsibility , directly and indirectly , for the cost of medical care to society , inevitably it will find it necessary to restrict or ration services . That is , it wo n't allow us to make our own choices because it will have a political and fiscal stake in `` bending the cost curve down . '' As Mises noted long ago , intervention begets intervention . ( In this article I debunk the proposition that markets are just another way to ration goods and services . )
Advocates of a government-directed medical system may have the best intentions , but intentions ca n't override market forces , which are generated by purposeful human action . Moreover , we have no ███ for confidence that politicians and bureaucrats will sufficiently distinguish the public 's interest ( if that can be defined beyond peoples ' individual interests ) from their own interests . Government officials are no less devoted to their careers and prestige than people outside the government ; indeed , power is what may have attracted many to government `` service . '' We must not compare the real-world market to the idealized state , because in reality , state operatives lack both the information and incentives needed to deliver the goods .
Summing up : Health care is a collection of important services , but that does not mean the laws of economics can be flouted without bad consequences . We know that competition works , even in the health care industry : in recent years LASIK eye surgery and cosmetic surgery , which are typically elective procedures not covered by insurance , have gone down in price and up in quality . This demonstrates what happens with consumers are cost-conscious ( even when competition is hampered ) .
Governments at all levels have created the problems that politicians and their consultants tell us only they can solve by force . Intervention stimulates demand by distorting prices and restricts supply by , among other ways , limiting the number of insurers and practitioners through occupational licensing and permitting , capping the number of hospitals and medical schools through accreditation , and making drugs and devices more expensive through the Food and Drug Administration 's bureaucratic rules and , importantly , patents . The system is riddled with government-sponsored cartels . ( For more on this see Kevin Carson 's `` Health Care and Radical Monopoly . '' )
Moreover , government limits access to health care in the myriad ways it impedes people 's general pursuit of financial success : state intervention lowers incomes compared to a freed economy and raises the prices of many goods by increasing scarcity and distorting production—that is , it stymies growth in living standards .
If universal access to medical care is the goal , the government is the goalie . It should get out of the way .","As the debate proceeds over what should succeed the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), here are a few basic ideas to keep in mind.

We live in a world of scarcity, which is to say that at any moment our ends surpass the available means to achieve them. We can't have everything now. Thus we have to choose among alternatives. It is obvious that the human race has pushed back the limits of scarcity, but that is the result of human ingenuity sufficiently free to solve problems, or what Julian Simon called ""the ultimate resource."" Nevertheless, right now we cannot have all we want, so we have to make choices. A quantity of a resource or a unit of labor services cannot be put to more than one purpose at a time. Making choices entails opportunity costs—the benefit we forgo by choosing alternative A over alternative B instead.

Despite the popular misconception, health care is not beyond economic law; it is not a free good that falls like manna from heaven. It has to be produced, which means people must mix their scarce labor with scarce resources to produce the things used to perform the medical services we want. It would be foolish to expect them to donate their labor and resources because other people need them. They have their own lives to live and livelihoods to earn. It would be wrong to compel them. They are not slaves.

In other words, no one can have a right to medical care or insurance, that is, to the labor services and resources of other people—including the taxpayers. We hear a great deal about the need to respect all people; well, respecting people must include respecting their liberty and justly acquired possessions. Without that, ""respect"" is hollow.

Politicians, of course, can declare a right to medical care, but those are mere words. What counts is what happens after the declaration. Since a system in which everyone could have, on demand, all the medical care they wanted at no cost would be unsustainable, the so-called right to medical care necessarily translates into the power of politicians and bureaucrats to set the terms under which medical services and products may be provided and received.

Natural rights—which boil down to the single right not to be aggressed against—require only that one abstain from aggression. Thus all can exercise their rights at once without conflict. On the other hand, government-invented ""rights""—such as the right to medical care—cannot be exercised at the same time; the potential for conflict is built in.

Moreover, we have no reason for confidence that politicians and bureaucrats will sufficiently distinguish the public's interest (if that can be defined beyond peoples' individual interests) from their own interests. Government officials are no less devoted to their careers and prestige than people outside the government; indeed, power is what may have attracted many to government ""service."" We must not compare the real-world market to the idealized state, because in reality, state operatives lack both the information and incentives needed to deliver the goods.

Summing up: Health care is a collection of important services, but that does not mean the laws of economics can be flouted without bad consequences. We know that competition works, even in the health care industry: in recent years LASIK eye surgery and cosmetic surgery, which are typically elective procedures not covered by insurance, have gone down in price and up in quality. This demonstrates what happens with consumers are cost-conscious (even when competition is hampered).

Governments at all levels have created the problems that politicians and their consultants tell us only they can solve by force. Intervention stimulates demand by distorting prices and restricts supply by, among other ways, limiting the number of insurers and practitioners through occupational licensing and permitting, capping the number of hospitals and medical schools through accreditation, and making drugs and devices more expensive through the Food and Drug Administration's bureaucratic rules and, importantly, patents. The system is riddled with government-sponsored cartels. (For more on this see Kevin Carson's ""Health Care and Radical Monopoly."")

Moreover, government limits access to health care in the myriad ways it impedes people's general pursuit of financial success: state intervention lowers incomes compared to a freed economy and raises the prices of many goods by increasing scarcity and distorting production—that is, it stymies growth in living standards.

If universal access to medical care is the goal, the government is the goalie. It should get out of the way.

• Obama tries to outrun bad news on health law
OBAMA TRIES TO OUTRUN BAD NEWS ON HEALTH LAW - President Obama keeps up his sales pitch for free and subsidized health insurance benefits today , working to convince skeptical young consumers to sign up . But as he heads to Prince George ’ s Community College in suburban Washington to encourage students to sign up , he ’ ll be followed by another bad headline for his signature law , this time from a very problematic agency .
IRS failed to account for $ 67M in ObamaCare costs - “ The Internal Revenue Service is unable to account for $ 67 million in spending related to the implementation of ObamaCare , according to a report by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration . The $ 67 million in unaccounted-for spending was associated with ‘ indirect ’ implementation costs , which can include providing employees with workspace and information technology support. ” More

NEXT STEPS IN SENATE - With a government shutdown looming , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nev. , is speeding things up . Reid made procedural moves that set up a Friday-morning vote on a short-term emergency spending bill . That vote will prove painful for some Republicans after Sen. Ted Cruz ’ s impassioned 21-hour speech urging his colleagues to block any spending bills until Democrats agree to rip out ObamaCare funding . But with GOP leaders vowing to plow ahead , congressional clock watchers expect a final vote – including a promised amendment from Reid restoring ObamaCare funding –sometime Saturday . The final votes can pass with a Democrat-only simple majority .
[ Watch Fox : Sen. Marco Rubio , R-Fla. , discusses what Sen. Ted Cruz , R-Texas , accomplished during his 21-hour marathon speech in the 9 a.m . ET hour ]
Hurdles for the House - Republicans in the House will then have to decide whether to stand by their demand that the health law be defunded and risk a government shutdown , or pass the revised bill allowing key parts of ObamaCare to launch on Oct.1 . Leaders are mulling whether to push through a super-short-term spending bill – perhaps for as little as a week – in order to buy more time to negotiate . But remember , the administration has set the date for the next fiscal cliff : Oct. 17 when the Treasury Department says it needs more borrowing authority . One idea in GOP circles is to push the spending squabble ahead long enough to expand the fight to include the debt limit .

Viewers of all political stripes agreed with The Weekly Standard ’ s Steve Hayes that everything , including Social Security and entitlements , should be on the table .
Women disagreed more strongly than men with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ’ s contention that Texas Sen. Ted Cruz ’ s floor speech was a waste of time .

healthcare,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/21/quarter-obamacare-enrollees-say-law-hurt-them-even/,"A quarter of Obamacare enrollees say the law hurt them, even those with gov’t subsidies: Survey  ",2015-05-21,Tom Howell Jr.,"More than a quarter of Obamacare enrollees say they ’ ve been negatively affected by the law , according to a study released Thursday that finds deeply partisan views of the 2010 overhaul persist .
The Kaiser Family Foundation said 27 percent of people with plans from the law ’ s marketplace felt worse off , while 53 percent said they had benefitted .
The numbers changed little when the survey isolated people who received government subsidies to help them pay for coverage , with 57 percent saying they benefitted and 25 percent holding a negative view .
The findings were part of an extensive study on people in the non-group market , or people who got insurance on their own — either on an Obamacare exchange or on the open market — and not through a job or public program .
Kaiser said six out of 10 people in this market held a plan through the marketplace set up under the Affordable Care Act .
Among the non-group market overall , more than half of Republicans ( 55 percent ) said they ’ ve been negatively affected by Obamacare , while only 19 percent reported a benefit .
The numbers swung the other way among Democrats , with nearly two-thirds reporting a benefit and 12 percent feeling slighted by the law .
The partisan divide is consistent with prior Obamacare polling and reflects the atmosphere on Capitol Hill , where congressional Republicans are pushing to repeal President Obama ’ s signature law through a fast-track budget tool or by leveraging a Supreme Court decision , due by June , that could gut the law by striking down its subsidies in at least 34 states .
The study also found that three quarters of Obamacare customers are satisfied with their coverage , although a large share still worry about their medical costs , particularly if they have a deductible above $ 1,500 .

Among those who blindly renewed , about a third said they were satisfied with their coverage , and one in 10 said they were too busy to shop around .","More than a quarter of Obamacare enrollees say they’ve been negatively affected by the law, according to a study released Thursday that finds deeply partisan views of the 2010 overhaul persist.

The Kaiser Family Foundation said 27 percent of people with plans from the law’s marketplace felt worse off, while 53 percent said they had benefitted.

The numbers changed little when the survey isolated people who received government subsidies to help them pay for coverage, with 57 percent saying they benefitted and 25 percent holding a negative view.

The findings were part of an extensive study on people in the non-group market, or people who got insurance on their own — either on an Obamacare exchange or on the open market — and not through a job or public program.

Kaiser said six out of 10 people in this market held a plan through the marketplace set up under the Affordable Care Act.

Among the non-group market overall, more than half of Republicans (55 percent) said they’ve been negatively affected by Obamacare, while only 19 percent reported a benefit.

The numbers swung the other way among Democrats, with nearly two-thirds reporting a benefit and 12 percent feeling slighted by the law.

The partisan divide is consistent with prior Obamacare polling and reflects the atmosphere on Capitol Hill, where congressional Republicans are pushing to repeal President Obama’s signature law through a fast-track budget tool or by leveraging a Supreme Court decision, due by June, that could gut the law by striking down its subsidies in at least 34 states.

The study also found that three quarters of Obamacare customers are satisfied with their coverage, although a large share still worry about their medical costs, particularly if they have a deductible above $1,500.

Nearly seven in 10 people who hold Obamacare-compliant plans said they didn’t bother to shop around when they renewed their 2014 coverage for this year, even though the law was designed to compel Americans to find the best deal from year to year.

Among those who blindly renewed, about a third said they were satisfied with their coverage, and one in 10 said they were too busy to shop around.

Republicans have been fighting Democrats for years over Obamacare. Now, they’re fighting each other.

In red-state capitols in places like Idaho, Tennessee and Mississippi, Republicans are clashing over whether to participate in a Democratic president’s signature legislative achievement.

Story Continued Below

At issue are the state-based health care exchanges, set to start in 2014, which will create new marketplaces for people who can’t get insurance elsewhere. If states don’t declare their plans to set one up by Dec. 14, the Department of Health and Human Services will begin doing it for them. So Republicans face a choice: Create their own and appear to endorse a federal government health care takeover, or allow Washington to take control.

Nowhere is the fight playing out more publicly among Republicans than in Mississippi.

Mississippi Insurance Commissioner Mike Chaney informed HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius Nov. 14 that he will oversee the creation of a health insurance exchange despite the objections of Gov. Phil Bryant. On Monday, in a previously unreleased letter, Bryant wrote Sebelius to say he “feels compelled to notify you of my complete disagreement with this move.”

Chaney — who by state law has broad authority to create a health care exchange without oversight from state legislators or Bryant — said the governor has failed to explain why Washington would be better than Mississippi to operate the state’s health care exchange.

The two Republicans have squabbled since July over whether to pursue an exchange, with Bryant insisting the state not do so and Chaney arguing in favor.

“The governor asked me, ‘What authority do you have to do this?’” Chaney told POLITICO. “And I said, ‘Phil, what authority do you have to stop me?’”

After Obama won reelection, Chaney said he confronted Bryant Nov. 12 in a men’s room during a local conference and asked why the governor wasn’t returning his phone calls. The governor, he said, explained that he’d been on a hunting trip out of cellphone range. The next day, the two men met at the Mississippi Governor’s Mansion, where Chaney said Bryant told him that the GOP governors had agreed to stand together in opposing the exchanges.

“I said, ‘Can you articulate any reason for us not to do this?’” Chaney told POLITICO. “He said, ‘We — some of the Republican governors — should not give in to the Obama administration on this, because they will change the rules and control everything. You cannot trust them.’”

Bryant’s office confirmed the meeting but declined to discuss specifics of the conversation.

The next day, Chaney, a vocal Mitt Romney supporter who says “I hate the Affordable Care Act” and would have voted against it, submitted his exchange plans to HHS. Two days later, Bryant fired off a news release condemning the move.",www.politico.com,left,ITy1sVQdZODZQLy4

Here's a bit more on the three lawsuits:

Pruitt v. Burwell

This challenge, filed in late 2012 by Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, was the first lawsuit to argue that Obamacare's subsidies on the federal marketplace were illegal. It's important because it marked the first time a plaintiff actually got on board with a legal argument that had been circulating in conservative legal circles for about a year.

Important documents:

Halbig v. Burwell

Challengers filed in court in May 2013, about six months after the Pruitt case. The Competitive Enterprise Institute is funding this case, as well as King v. Burwell. Halbig is different from Pruitt because it includes private citizens and businesses as its plaintiffs. This was strategic on the part of the law's challengers: they wanted to give courts as many different arguments as possible to choose from. In Halbig, a district court initially ruled in the government's favor — but the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia reversed that decision in July. This is the other ruling against the law, alongside Pruitt.

Important documents:

This is the lawsuit that the Supreme Court decided to hear in November. Like Halbig, it also includes private citizens and business owners as challengers to the law. Both courts that have heard the King argument have ruled in the Obama administration's favor, finding the health law's subsidies to be legal.

Cassidy cited a Thursday closed-door Republican lunch as a turning point in favor of the bill.

“I’m pretty confident we’ll get there on the Republican side,” he said, calling the midweek discussion what ""may have been my best day as a senator.""

“We’re probably at 48, 49, and talking to two or three more,"" he said.

An aide to Cassidy said later that they still believe there’s a path to 50 votes, even without Paul’s support.

Cassidy and Graham are also expecting Senate Republican leadership and possibly President Donald Trump to lend support in the coming days, to push it over the finish line.

“I’m hoping that the president will show the same enthusiasm to repeal Obamacare that President Obama showed to pass it,” Graham said on Wednesday.

But doing it all before the end of the month remains a long shot. The CBO has not yet scored the bill’s effects, and senators are still sorting through how their states would fare under legislation that would dismantle Obamacare in favor of sending block grants to individual states.

Under the legislation, rural states and those that didn't expand their Medicaid programs would largely receive more funding for health care. But the states that have been most successful so far in getting people covered stand to see billions of dollars in funding cuts.

“At some point, you have to ask Massachusetts to control their costs,” Cassidy said.

The Louisiana Republican preemptively dismissed any CBO calculations showing coverage losses, arguing the agency puts too much faith in Obamacare’s individual mandate, and that his plan would incentivize governors to get more residents covered.

CBO's reports played a large part in derailing the GOP's previous repeal bills, after moderate Republicans balked at projections showing millions more would go uninsured compared with Obamacare.

“I just don’t care about the coverage numbers, because their methodology has proven to be wrong,” he said of CBO. “And ours, frankly, empirically, is correct.”

Cassidy also waved off concerns that under the Cassidy-Graham bill, federal funding to states would need to be periodically reauthorized. Budget restrictions prevent him from funding the block grants beyond 2026, he said, expressing confidence that Congress would keep the money flowing in the same way it’s continually agreed to fund the Children’s Health Insurance Program.

If he fails to get 50 senators on board by the end of September, Cassidy pledged to continue working toward repeal — even if his own party is ready to move onto other issues.

“If we don’t get it through now, we’d like to do it in the future,” he said. “But we are thinking we can get this done by Sept. 30.”

The administration’s admission this week that premiums for Obamacare’s benchmark plans will spike an average of 22 percent nationally in 2017 has further dented the law, and left its defenders struggling for answers.

Mrs. Clinton, despite being the original author of HillaryCare, Democrats’ 1990s-era foray into expanding health care, didn’t touch the issue at campaign rally in Florida, keeping her campaign focused on early voting and attacks on GOP nominee Donald Trump.

Yet even if Mrs. Clinton defeats Mr. Trump in November, her plans to put Obamacare on firm economic footing face significant headwinds, as her “fixes” would require politically painful requests for more taxpayer spending and a bigger government footprint in the law’s insurance exchanges.

This will be the first presidential primary election since Maine dropped the more complicated and time-consuming caucus system . And while the state hasn ’ t received much in-person attention from the candidates , Maine ’ s participation in the Super Tuesday primaries means registered Democrats will be casting their ballots at at time when their party ’ s nomination contest is still wide open .
Polling times Most polls for Tuesday ’ s Maine presidential primary open at 7 a.m. and close at 8 p.m. statewide . Vaccine Referendum A “ yes ” vote on Question 1 would overturn the new vaccine law and allow parents to opt out of vaccinating their children for religious or philosophical reasons . A “ no ” vote would keep the law on the books , thereby requiring vaccinations before children can attend school except when a doctor grants a medical exemption .
“ I think people are excited to go out and vote , ” said Maine Senate President Troy Jackson , D-Allagash , who is a state co-chairman of the Bernie Sanders campaign . “ I don ’ t think they like the way the country is going right now . ”
Registered Democrats will have their choice of six candidates on Tuesday ’ s ballot who are still actively campaigning for the party ’ s nomination : Joe Biden , Michael Bloomberg , Tulsi Gabbard , Amy Klobuchar , Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren . Tom Steyer and Pete Buttigieg dropped out over the weekend following the primary in South Carolina . Biden ’ s campaign appeared to be re-energized after his landslide win there , giving his supporters more hope headed into Super Tuesday .
Republicans will also technically hold a presidential primary but with only one contender in Maine : President Trump .
Fourteen states along with American Samoa and Democrats living abroad will participate in Super Tuesday . Those states account for roughly one-third of the Democratic delegates up for grabs in the nominating process thanks , in large part , to the involvement of such populous states as California , Texas and North Carolina .
Maine is running “ closed primaries ” this year , meaning that only individuals registered as a Democrat or Republican can cast ballots in those respective party contests . Unenrolled voters can join a party at the polls , as can individuals registering to vote for the first time on Election Day . But registered Democrats , Republicans or Green Independent voters can not change their party affiliation at the polls in order to participate in another primary .
But there is another issue on the statewide ballot in which all registered voters can participate .
Question 1 on the ballot is a “ people ’ s veto ” effort organized by groups that want to preserve parents ’ ability to claim religious or philosophical exemptions to Maine ’ s law requiring that children receive a bevy of vaccinations before attending school .
Last year after a contentious legislative battle , Gov . Janet Mills signed into law a bill that eliminates those religious and philosophical exemptions to mandatory vaccinations . Supporters said closing the exemptions was a necessary step to reverse an alarming drop in the number of children who enter schools without receiving vaccinations against pertussis , measles and other preventable diseases . Maintaining the “ herd immunity ” created by high vaccination rates also helps to protect children with weakened immune systems .
But opponents of the law collected enough signatures to send the issue to voters , arguing the mandate violates parental rights .
As with other “ people ’ s veto ” campaigns , groups on both sides having been battling voter confusion about the question ’ s wording headed into Tuesday .
A “ yes ” vote on Question 1 would overturn the law and allow parents to opt out of vaccinating their children for religious or philosophical reasons . A “ no ” vote would keep the law on the books , thereby requiring vaccinations before children can attend school except when a doctor grants a medical exemption .
With just 24 Democratic delegates up for grabs , Maine is the third-smallest prize for presidential hopefuls on Super Tuesday after Vermont and American Samoa . California , by comparison , has 415 delegates at play while Massachusetts has 91 delegates .
That likely helps explain why relatively few presidential candidates have campaigned in Maine this year , although several candidates or their national surrogates were making last-minute trips to the Pine Tree State .
On Saturday , Klobuchar addressed a crowd of several hundred people in Portland .
The Minnesota senator , who is battling Biden and Bloomberg for the moderate vote , emphasized her rural roots and experience at the local , state and national levels . Throughout her campaign , Klobuchar has also pointed to her election victories in both rural and urban Minnesota as well as her track record of accomplishments in the sharply divided Senate .
“ I think Maine , that practical state that you are , understands that it ’ s important to have bold ideas that can actually get done , ” Klobuchar said .
In 2016 , Sanders easily defeated rival Hillary Clinton during Maine ’ s Democratic caucuses , winning 64 percent of the vote on a day when heavy turnout overwhelmed organizers at some caucus locations . The chaotic scene in Portland at several other caucus locations was a driving force behind the push to switch back to a presidential primary .
This year , Sanders is competing against five other Democrats who are still in the race . A recent Colby College poll of roughly 350 Democrats in Maine showed Sanders leading the pack of party rivals with 25 percent support followed by Bloomberg at 14 percent and Biden at 12 percent . The other three candidates — Warren , Klobuchar and Gabbard — were all in the single-digits .
Sanders ’ supporters remain optimistic about the Vermonter ’ s chances in Maine , though , even if he doesn ’ t win by as large a margin .
“ I think overall we are going to win and we are going to see a good turnout , ” said Jackson , the Maine Senate president .
Bloomberg made two stops in Maine in late January as part of his strategy to largely skip campaigning in the first four battleground states and , instead , focus on the Super Tuesday contests . Bloomberg has been advertising heavily in Maine for months , as he has in other states voting on Tuesday .
Over the weekend , Bloomberg ’ s Maine team and surrogates campaigned at the Cam-Am Crown International dog sled races in Aroostook County and knocked in doors in Bangor , Scarborough , Augusta and Lewiston .
Crystal Canney , state director for Bloomberg , said the campaign knocked on 21,000 doors in 50 towns in recent days and hopes to hit another 50 towns by Tuesday . The Bloomberg campaign has 20 paid staffers in Maine and more than 100 volunteers .

Of course , Republicans are also gearing up for November even if their nominee doesn ’ t have to fend of any primary challengers .
Over the weekend , the Trump campaign held a “ canvass launch ” in Penobscot County and knocked on doors in support of the president and Garrel Craig , a Republican vying to to fill a vacant legislative seat representing Brewer .

Marsha Blackburn , R-Tenn. , made an interesting argument that some Americans don ’ t want quality health insurance . “ Some people like to drive a Ford and not a Ferrari , ” Blackburn asserted . But that begs the question : What kind of Ford ?
As early as 1972 , there were reports that when a Ford Pinto was involved in a low-speed collision , the car would spontaneously burst into flames . According to a 1977 investigation by Mother Jones magazine , Ford was aware of the problem — resulting from a flaw in the gas tank design — but instead of paying to recall and redesign the car , Ford decided it would be cheaper to pay for the lawsuits . Ultimately , at least 27 people and as many as 180 people died as a result of Pinto fires . But it took the government forcing Ford to recall the Pinto for the problem to actually be solved .
In 2009 , millions of Americans lacked any health insurance whatsoever and millions more had private health insurance metaphorically designed to explode at the hint of any serious illness or preexisting conditions or exorbitant medical costs . So , in 2009 , 14,000 Americans were losing their health insurance every single day . And medical bills were prompting more than 60 percent of all bankruptcies in our nation . In other words , many health insurance policies were patently dangerous and unsafe .
Now , Rep. Blackburn and her ilk might argue that people should have been free to buy the Pinto if they wanted , without government intrusion into personal choices or private business practice — just like they seem to want to argue that Americans should be free to hold onto their inadequate , costly and reckless insurance policies that throw them off at the slightest sign of illness while forcing costs up for the rest of us . But , arguably , most Americans want to buy cars that are safe . Auto companies didn ’ t want to install seat belts and airbags , just like Ford didn ’ t want to fix the Pinto . That was government regulation at work , making us all more safe — even if , in some cases , it made cars more expensive . We ultimately save , in every way imaginable , when the number of traffic deaths is dramatically cut .
This is , in effect , exactly what the Affordable Care Act does with respect to some currently existing , private insurance policies . If those policies don ’ t meet a new , higher bar of quality coverage , then the government will no longer allow insurance companies to sell them . Instead , the 5 percent of Americans who rely on the individual insurance market for their coverage will have other options , all that provide better quality coverage and many of which are far less expensive . Plus , at least half of folks on the individual market will be eligible for subsidies that further bring costs down .
A great example comes from Deborah Cavallaro , who has been making the rounds on television complaining about her current insurance plan being canceled . Cavallaro had not looked into her other , new options under Obamacare until a Los Angeles Times reporter called . Together , they looked at Cavallaro ’ s options — and found a “ silver ” plan for Cavallaro that would cost slightly more in her monthly premium but save her tons in terms of her annual deductible and out-of-pocket costs as well as doctor visit expenses . Plus , thanks to Obamacare , this plan would not be subject to the annual payment caps or preexisting condition clauses that have been exploding in the faces of consumers for decades . After all , it ’ s important to remember that in 2009 , most Americans were not very satisfied with their insurance plans . People wanted better options , and now , thanks to Obamacare , they ’ ve got ‘ em !
Congresswoman Blackburn and her cohort might fire back something about young , healthy men being required to pay for good insurance plans that cover maternity — one of 10 basic coverage requirements mandated under the Affordable Care Act , this one designed to undo the history of insurance plans discriminating against women and families . Perhaps Republicans might also argue that Americans who live in really flat places should be able to buy cars without brakes . But that wouldn ’ t be safe for drivers or the rest of us . And in the case of healthcare reform , in particular , the point here is to bring down costs and raise the quality of care for all of us . Those young , healthy men are going to grow up and have families one day — and then eventually become elderly — and will benefit from an insurance system that keeps costs manageable throughout and doesn ’ t kick off the elderly or infirm . Just as we all benefit from seat belts and airbags , even if we never get in an accident .
Nobody is forcing anyone to buy a Ferrari plan in the individual health insurance exchange . At least 6.4 million Americans will pay less than $ 100 per month for coverage in the Obamacare exchanges — which means there are plenty of Fords available . What the Affordable Care Act simply ensures is that those policies will be safe and reliable -- and not catch fire when we least expect it .","During congressional hearings with Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, Rep.

So, in 2009, 14,000 Americans were losing their health insurance every single day. And medical bills were prompting more than 60 percent of all bankruptcies in our nation. In other words, many health insurance policies were patently dangerous and unsafe.

Now, Rep. Blackburn and her ilk might argue that people should have been free to buy the Pinto if they wanted, without government intrusion into personal choices or private business practice — just like they seem to want to argue that Americans should be free to hold onto their inadequate, costly and reckless insurance policies that throw them off at the slightest sign of illness while forcing costs up for the rest of us. But, arguably, most Americans want to buy cars that are safe. Auto companies didn’t want to install seat belts and airbags, just like Ford didn’t want to fix the Pinto. That was government regulation at work, making us all more safe — even if, in some cases, it made cars more expensive. We ultimately save, in every way imaginable, when the number of traffic deaths is dramatically cut.

This is, in effect, exactly what the Affordable Care Act does with respect to some currently existing, private insurance policies. If those policies don’t meet a new, higher bar of quality coverage, then the government will no longer allow insurance companies to sell them. Instead, the 5 percent of Americans who rely on the individual insurance market for their coverage will have other options, all that provide better quality coverage and many of which are far less expensive. Plus, at least half of folks on the individual market will be eligible for subsidies that further bring costs down.

A great example comes from Deborah Cavallaro, who has been making the rounds on television complaining about her current insurance plan being canceled. Cavallaro had not looked into her other, new options under Obamacare until a Los Angeles Times reporter called. Together, they looked at Cavallaro’s options — and found a “silver” plan for Cavallaro that would cost slightly more in her monthly premium but save her tons in terms of her annual deductible and out-of-pocket costs as well as doctor visit expenses. Plus, thanks to Obamacare, this plan would not be subject to the annual payment caps or preexisting condition clauses that have been exploding in the faces of consumers for decades. After all, it’s important to remember that in 2009, most Americans were not very satisfied with their insurance plans. People wanted better options, and now, thanks to Obamacare, they’ve got ‘em!

Congresswoman Blackburn and her cohort might fire back something about young, healthy men being required to pay for good insurance plans that cover maternity — one of 10 basic coverage requirements mandated under the Affordable Care Act, this one designed to undo the history of insurance plans discriminating against women and families. Perhaps Republicans might also argue that Americans who live in really flat places should be able to buy cars without brakes. But that wouldn’t be safe for drivers or the rest of us. And in the case of healthcare reform, in particular, the point here is to bring down costs and raise the quality of care for all of us. Those young, healthy men are going to grow up and have families one day — and then eventually become elderly — and will benefit from an insurance system that keeps costs manageable throughout and doesn’t kick off the elderly or infirm. Just as we all benefit from seat belts and airbags, even if we never get in an accident.

Nobody is forcing anyone to buy a Ferrari plan in the individual health insurance exchange. At least 6.4 million Americans will pay less than $100 per month for coverage in the Obamacare exchanges — which means there are plenty of Fords available. What the Affordable Care Act simply ensures is that those policies will be safe and reliable -- and not catch fire when we least expect it.",www.salon.com,left,2mTrd09khCq4Otov

Democrats are pushing for bipartisan talks in the Senate Health Committee, which Republicans shut down earlier this week.

McCain cited those talks in opposing the new bill, and Trump has given more nods toward working with Democrats in recent weeks. The president also wants to turn to tax reform, which is taking up an increasing amount of his workload.

A key issue in the bipartisan talks would be addressing payments known as cost-sharing reductions that help insurers provide coverage to low- and middle-income people.

Trump has threatened to cancel those payments in an effort to make ObamaCare “implode.” And he still could.

The bipartisan Senate talks were aimed at providing congressional approval for those funds to cement their legality and prevent Trump from canceling them. Insurers say that step would be critical in giving them certainty and preventing premium increases.

As the Obama administration and Obamacare opponents prepare for another Supreme Court showdown Wednesday , both sides are tailoring their arguments to win over the chief justice , who cast the saving vote for the Affordable Care Act in 2012 , and Kennedy , the perennial swing vote on the Supreme Court .
The court is likely to split largely along ideological lines with Kennedy or Roberts casting crucial votes . Some Obamacare backers are even making a pitch to Justice Antonin Scalia to look at a broad reading of the law , although winning him over seems like a long shot .
The challengers — four Virginia residents who don ’ t want to abide by the mandate that Americans buy health insurance — argue that the Obama administration is illegally giving out Obamacare subsidies . They say a phrase in the text of the massive law — that subsidies go to “ exchanges established by the state ” — only allows the money to go to residents of the 16 states , plus Washington , D.C. , that set up their own insurance exchanges . If the plaintiffs prevail , more than 7 million people now receiving the subsidies in 34 states would lose them .
The opponents ’ lawyer , Michael A. Carvin of the law firm Jones Day , will argue that Congress all along intended to direct the subsidies through the state-run exchange as an incentive for the states to take on that task instead of leaving it to the federal government . The plaintiffs point to early versions of health reform legislation , one considered in the Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee , that tied together subsidies and a state ’ s insurance reforms .
The first goal of Solicitor General Don Verrilli is to take apart the challengers ’ narrative . Several Democratic members of Congress who wrote the law told the court that there was never a plan to use the subsidies as an incentive to states . Of all the congressional debate over Obamacare in 2009 and 2010 , no one considered that Democrats were setting up a scheme in which blue states would get a benefit that most red states wouldn ’ t accept , the government will say .
“ If there was any ambiguity that not everyone [ would be eligible for subsidies ] there would have been a war among the Democratic Caucus that you all could not have helped but noticed , ” said John McDonough , who was a senior health staffer on the HELP Committee at the time .
The Obama administration hopes to set up a scenario in which the justices agree it ’ s clear that Congress intended for subsidies to go to everyone . That would make it much harder for them to rule that the subsidies must end merely based on the one clause . It ’ s an argument that could resonate with Roberts and Kennedy .
However , the law ’ s critics are hoping that the two justices do precisely the opposite : that they find the phrase about the state exchanges so clear-cut that they don ’ t embark on a quest to sort out what Congress intended .
Both the chief justice and Justice Kennedy have shown textualist sympathies , have shown that they care about the parsing of statutes .
“ Both the chief justice and Justice Kennedy have shown textualist sympathies , have shown that they care about the parsing of statutes , ” said Case Western University law professor Jonathan Adler , who was one of the first to argue that the subsidies were not authorized .
Even if the text of the law is not perfectly crystal clear , the Obama administration plans to argue , the federal agencies should receive deference to sort out details and ambiguities . That ’ s a concept that Neal Katyal , a former acting solicitor general who defended the 2012 health care challenge for the Obama administration , says is favored by the court ’ s conservative justices . In this case , the IRS is the agency that has been responsible for the subsidies , which come in the form of tax credits .
“ I think it will be particularly hard for the conservatives on the court to adopt the challengers ’ position on this issue , ” said Katyal , who is representing hospitals in this case .
However , opponents of the law say it would be a mistake to let an agency decide to offer tax credits , which affect tax refunds and equate to direct payments out of the U.S. Treasury .
“ Decisions of a certain magnitude are not the sort of thing that Congress would delegate to an agency , ” Adler said . “ It would really be quite something to conclude that Congress had delegated the decision whether to offer tax credits to the IRS . ”
One argument the White House and its allies are directing at Roberts : Ruling for the challengers would cause chaos in the insurance system — an idea some lawyers believe will worry the chief justice .
Several economic groups , health industries and think tanks that support the Affordable Care Act have released reports outlining the damage that would be done if the court rules against the White House . The Urban Institute says stopping the subsidies would increase the number of uninsured by 8.2 million and eliminate $ 28.8 billion in tax credits in 2016 .

As the Obama administration and Obamacare opponents prepare for another Supreme Court showdown Wednesday, both sides are tailoring their arguments to win over the chief justice, who cast the saving vote for the Affordable Care Act in 2012, and Kennedy, the perennial swing vote on the Supreme Court.

Story Continued Below

The court is likely to split largely along ideological lines with Kennedy or Roberts casting crucial votes. Some Obamacare backers are even making a pitch to Justice Antonin Scalia to look at a broad reading of the law, although winning him over seems like a long shot.

The challengers — four Virginia residents who don’t want to abide by the mandate that Americans buy health insurance — argue that the Obama administration is illegally giving out Obamacare subsidies. They say a phrase in the text of the massive law — that subsidies go to “exchanges established by the state” — only allows the money to go to residents of the 16 states, plus Washington, D.C., that set up their own insurance exchanges. If the plaintiffs prevail, more than 7 million people now receiving the subsidies in 34 states would lose them.

The opponents’ lawyer, Michael A. Carvin of the law firm Jones Day, will argue that Congress all along intended to direct the subsidies through the state-run exchange as an incentive for the states to take on that task instead of leaving it to the federal government. The plaintiffs point to early versions of health reform legislation, one considered in the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, that tied together subsidies and a state’s insurance reforms.

The first goal of Solicitor General Don Verrilli is to take apart the challengers’ narrative. Several Democratic members of Congress who wrote the law told the court that there was never a plan to use the subsidies as an incentive to states. Of all the congressional debate over Obamacare in 2009 and 2010, no one considered that Democrats were setting up a scheme in which blue states would get a benefit that most red states wouldn’t accept, the government will say.

“If there was any ambiguity that not everyone [would be eligible for subsidies] there would have been a war among the Democratic Caucus that you all could not have helped but noticed,” said John McDonough, who was a senior health staffer on the HELP Committee at the time.

The Obama administration hopes to set up a scenario in which the justices agree it’s clear that Congress intended for subsidies to go to everyone. That would make it much harder for them to rule that the subsidies must end merely based on the one clause. It’s an argument that could resonate with Roberts and Kennedy.

However, the law’s critics are hoping that the two justices do precisely the opposite: that they find the phrase about the state exchanges so clear-cut that they don’t embark on a quest to sort out what Congress intended.

Both the chief justice and Justice Kennedy have shown textualist sympathies, have shown that they care about the parsing of statutes.

“Both the chief justice and Justice Kennedy have shown textualist sympathies, have shown that they care about the parsing of statutes,” said Case Western University law professor Jonathan Adler, who was one of the first to argue that the subsidies were not authorized.

Even if the text of the law is not perfectly crystal clear, the Obama administration plans to argue, the federal agencies should receive deference to sort out details and ambiguities. That’s a concept that Neal Katyal, a former acting solicitor general who defended the 2012 health care challenge for the Obama administration, says is favored by the court’s conservative justices. In this case, the IRS is the agency that has been responsible for the subsidies, which come in the form of tax credits.

“I think it will be particularly hard for the conservatives on the court to adopt the challengers’ position on this issue,” said Katyal, who is representing hospitals in this case.

However, opponents of the law say it would be a mistake to let an agency decide to offer tax credits, which affect tax refunds and equate to direct payments out of the U.S. Treasury.

“Decisions of a certain magnitude are not the sort of thing that Congress would delegate to an agency,” Adler said. “It would really be quite something to conclude that Congress had delegated the decision whether to offer tax credits to the IRS.”

One argument the White House and its allies are directing at Roberts: Ruling for the challengers would cause chaos in the insurance system — an idea some lawyers believe will worry the chief justice.

Several economic groups, health industries and think tanks that support the Affordable Care Act have released reports outlining the damage that would be done if the court rules against the White House. The Urban Institute says stopping the subsidies would increase the number of uninsured by 8.2 million and eliminate $28.8 billion in tax credits in 2016. They further outline ripple effects that would create chaos in insurance markets.

Republican supporters of King are trying to address the chaos theory, too — and signal to the justices that they’ll prevent it. Three prominent Republican senators, including Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, wrote in a Washington Post op-ed this weekend that they are working on plans to allow the subsidies to continue on a transitional basis while the GOP-led Congress works out an Obamacare alternative. They haven’t spelled out details, and it’s not clear how much support they have even among fellow Republicans.

Some legal experts sympathetic to the challengers are similarly trying to downplay the significance of the case or its political fallout.

“The prior Obamacare case was momentous,” said Georgetown University law professor Nicholas Rosenkranz. “A Justice Kennedy or a Justice Roberts will bend over backwards to avoid concluding that Congress violated the Constitution. … This case is just about what the words of the statute mean. … There’s nothing at all daunting about this.”

The most obvious, cited at least three times, was the chief justice’s decisive vote to uphold the health law in the 2012 case challenging the constitutionality of the individual mandate.

Government lawyers also rely on a 6-3 decision Roberts wrote last year, rejecting use of a federal chemical weapons law to prosecute a Pennsylvania woman who used toxic chemicals to attempt to poison her husband’s mistress.

In that case, the chief justice effectively added some more language to the statute to avoid what appeared to be an unintended result — the same kind of reading Obamacare defenders want the justices to adopt in the King case.

“The notion that some things ‘go without saying’ applies to legislation just as it does to everyday life,” Roberts wrote in the mistress-poisoning case.

Obamacare supporters say the chief justice doesn’t have to resort to the same degree of statutory surgery to side with the White House in this case.

Backers of the health care law have other things to worry about, though. They are nervous that Roberts might fall into a pattern of punting tough decisions to Congress even when it’s virtually certain that perpetually gridlocked lawmakers won’t act.

In a landmark ruling on the Voting Rights Act two years ago, Roberts struck down a key formula that subjected parts or all of 15 states to advance clearance of voting-related changes by the Justice Department or a federal court. The chief justice argued that if Congress didn’t like the decision, it could devise a new formula more suited to the times.

The breakup with insurers
President Barack Obama is breaking up with the health insurance industry again .
He ’ s had a love-hate relationship with the insurers ever since the early days of the health care reform debate . He yelled at them in public for giving people skimpy coverage , then slipped them a gift-wrapped box of chocolates — the individual mandate they wanted to gain millions of new customers .
Even during the implementation of Obamacare , he has stuck with the industry , staying in the rocky relationship despite all the petty bickering . He has to use them as a foil to advertise the law ’ s benefits , like all the rebates from greedy insurance companies . But he also needs them to make the law work — which is why he has been careful not to raise his voice at them even as they sent cancellation notices to individual insurance customers throughout the country .
Now , Obama is putting them on the spot . The message of his proposed one-year fix to the cancelled policies is this : I ’ m giving you a chance to clean up the mess . If you don ’ t clean it up , don ’ t blame it on me .
“ The bottom line is insurers can extend current plans that would otherwise be cancelled into 2014 , ” Obama said at his Thursday press conference .
Industry CEOs have been summoned to a White House meeting Friday that ’ s sure to be full of those awkward conversations about who did what to whom , and who ’ s being unreasonable this time .
It ’ s enough to stress a relationship to the breaking point . And breaking up , as the song goes , can indeed be hard to do - and in the case may have implications for innocent bystanders , such as health care customers .
“ The president was clear as a bell : ‘ We ’ ve done our part . If rates go up or anything , that ’ s not our fault. ’ And that ’ s not the case , ” said Bill Pierce , a former Department of Health and Human Services official who has also worked in the health insurance industry .
Democrats badly needed a fix to point to on Friday , when they 'll have to vote on a Republican bill to let all Americans keep their health plans . But the need to give Democrats political cover can ’ t justify a change that could backfire in other ways , Pierce said .
( IN 90 SECONDS : Obamacare puts Democrats ’ credibility on the line )
“ It is a political solution to a policy problem … You can not solve a policy problem with a political solution , ” said Pierce , now a senior director at APCO Worldwide .
Sure , there was a bit of “ it ’ s not you , it ’ s me ” in Obama ’ s press conference Thursday . “ That ’ s on me . I mean , we fumbled the rollout on this health care law , ” Obama said .
“ What we want to do is to be able to say to these folks , you know what , the Affordable Care Act is not going to be the reason why insurers have to cancel your plan , ” Obama said .
There ’ s just one problem : Health insurers say the fix won ’ t work . And state insurance commissioners and leading actuaries aren ’ t sure , either .
For one thing , health insurance plans already set their prices for the Obamacare plans assuming that they ’ d get a certain number of customers , and the right mix of healthy and sick people . If they don ’ t get those people , they ’ re warning that the mix will be thrown off , and prices will have to go up — creating a new nightmare for the administration .
“ Changing the rules after health plans have already met the requirements of the law could destabilize the market and result in higher premiums for consumers , ” Karen Ignagni of America ’ s Health Insurance Plans , the leading health insurance trade group , said in a statement .
“ Changing the [ Affordable Care Act ] provisions could alter the dynamics of the insurance market , creating two parallel markets operating under different rules , thereby threatening the viability of insurance markets operating under the new rules , ” said Cori Uccello , the senior health fellow at the American Academy of Actuaries .","Obama has had a love-hate relationship with insurers since the debate started.

Now, Obama is putting them on the spot. The message of his proposed one-year fix to the cancelled policies is this: I’m giving you a chance to clean up the mess. If you don’t clean it up, don’t blame it on me.

“The bottom line is insurers can extend current plans that would otherwise be cancelled into 2014,” Obama said at his Thursday press conference.

Industry CEOs have been summoned to a White House meeting Friday that’s sure to be full of those awkward conversations about who did what to whom, and who’s being unreasonable this time.

It’s enough to stress a relationship to the breaking point. And breaking up, as the song goes, can indeed be hard to do - and in the case may have implications for innocent bystanders, such as health care customers.

“The president was clear as a bell: ‘We’ve done our part. If rates go up or anything, that’s not our fault.’ And that’s not the case,” said Bill Pierce, a former Department of Health and Human Services official who has also worked in the health insurance industry.

Democrats badly needed a fix to point to on Friday, when they'll have to vote on a Republican bill to let all Americans keep their health plans. But the need to give Democrats political cover can’t justify a change that could backfire in other ways, Pierce said.

“It is a political solution to a policy problem … You cannot solve a policy problem with a political solution,” said Pierce, now a senior director at APCO Worldwide.

Sure, there was a bit of “it’s not you, it’s me” in Obama’s press conference Thursday. “That’s on me. I mean, we fumbled the rollout on this health care law,” Obama said.

But really, insurers, it’s you.

“What we want to do is to be able to say to these folks, you know what, the Affordable Care Act is not going to be the reason why insurers have to cancel your plan,” Obama said.

There’s just one problem: Health insurers say the fix won’t work. And state insurance commissioners and leading actuaries aren’t sure, either.

For one thing, health insurance plans already set their prices for the Obamacare plans assuming that they’d get a certain number of customers, and the right mix of healthy and sick people. If they don’t get those people, they’re warning that the mix will be thrown off, and prices will have to go up — creating a new nightmare for the administration.

“Changing the rules after health plans have already met the requirements of the law could destabilize the market and result in higher premiums for consumers,” Karen Ignagni of America’s Health Insurance Plans, the leading health insurance trade group, said in a statement.

Health insurance actuaries echoed the alarm.

“Changing the [Affordable Care Act] provisions could alter the dynamics of the insurance market, creating two parallel markets operating under different rules, thereby threatening the viability of insurance markets operating under the new rules,” said Cori Uccello, the senior health fellow at the American Academy of Actuaries.",www.politico.com,left,LW8moLsMQ3qqBF4q

Washington (CNN) - A majority of Americans still oppose the nation's new health care measure, three years after it became law, according to a new survey.

But a CNN/ORC International poll released Monday also indicates that more than a quarter of those who oppose the law, known by many as Obamacare, say they don't support the measure because it doesn't go far enough.

The wide partisan divide over the law remains. Nearly three quarters of Democrats say they favor the Affordable Care Act. That number drops to 16% among Republicans.

Company behind ObamaCare site has checkered past,2013-10-23,Kelley Beaucar Vlahos,"While the company behind the dysfunctional HealthCare.gov was virtually unknown to the American public until this month , critics say the Obama administration should have known this multibillion-dollar firm had a checkered history with other government contracts .
In projects stretching from Canada to Hawaii , parent company CGI Group and its subsidiaries ran into complaints about its performance . And this was while , and in some cases before , CGI Federal was paid millions , along with other contractors , to create the ObamaCare website .
`` The morning I heard CGI was behind [ Healthcare.gov ] , I said , my God , no wonder that thing does n't work , '' said James Bagnola , a Texas-based corporate consultant who was hired by the Hawaii Department of Taxation ( DOTAX ) in 2008 .
CGI Technologies and Solutions , Inc. , another subsidiary , had been responsible for overhauling the IT systems for the Hawaii tax department , and then , developing its new delinquent tax collection services . Not only was the software and implementation problematic , but the second contract , signed in 2009 , paid CGI millions for work it did not complete , according to a state audit completed in 2010 on the matter .
Still , they hold contracts all over the Hawaii government . Hawaii 's Health Connector , the state 's new health exchange for providing insurance options under ObamaCare , hired CGI to build its website . Like HealthCare.gov , the Hawaii portal had immediate problems when it launched on Oct. 1 , but those have since been rectified and so far , according to Health Connector officials who spoke with FoxNews.com , they are not blaming CGI .
Bagnola does n't buy it , saying when they overhauled DOTAX 's IT , `` the system was broken all the time . ''
`` I ca n't believe people continue to hire incompetency , '' he added .
The firm 's performance was also called into question when parent company , CGI Group , was hired to design and execute a new $ 46.2 million diabetes registry for eHealth Ontario , part of the Canadian government health care system . That contract was canceled in September 2012 after a series of delays that rendered the system obsolete , according to news reports at the time .
`` They did not meet the requirements of their contract which was faced with many layers of delays , which caused great angst among the health care providers who are trying to do their best , '' Frances Gélinas , a member of Ontario 's provincial parliament , told the Washington Examiner , in an Oct. 10 report .
It was reported initially that Canadian taxpayers were not on the hook for the nearly $ 15 million already spent by CGI because a clause in the contract said that if CGI did not meet the deadlines , it would n't get paid . The registry was supposed to be up and running by June 2011 . A later audit , however , found that the provincial government spent $ 24.4 million of its own money on the project before it was scrapped .
Meanwhile , the state of Vermont is reportedly considering whether to penalize CGI for not meeting its deadlines for designing and producing Vermont 's health care exchange , Vermont Health Connect , which is also experiencing the same kind of glitches as the federal system . In that case , the state recently signed an amended $ 84 million contract with CGI -- just $ 9 million less than the one it signed with the federal government in 2011 . In late September , VermontDigger.org reported that CGI failed to meet 21 deadlines this summer and the state could charge as much as $ 125,000 a day in penalties as a result .
`` I 'm going to demand answers , '' said Don Turner , who is the Republican minority leader in the Vermont House of Representatives . He told FoxNews.com that he just recently heard of CGI 's problems in Canada . `` There were a number of deliverables ( in the Vermont contract ) that have been missed . We are preparing to ask some tough questions . There are a lot of things that do n't seem right about CGI . ''
In the meantime , he added , `` there has been a lot of frustration '' with citizens trying to register on the new health care system . `` It is very disappointing . ''
CGI came to national attention after the problems with HealthCare.gov turned out to be much more than a short-term glitch . Since its dubious debut on Oct. 1 , it 's been determined that the software code and the basic infrastructure of the site 's design is at the root of the problem , which is keeping Americans from registering , logging in and buying health insurance . For the first time , President Obama personally addressed the issue this week , calling the problems `` unacceptable '' and pledging to put an army of new technicians on the problem .
CGI is not the only company or agency taking heat , with experts pointing out that numerous changes to the specifications , plus an unrealistic timetable that did not allow for proper testing , could account for the website 's most prevailing problems . That would be the government 's fault , not necessarily the contractor 's . As the administration has said all along , some glitches were expected as with the roll-out of any product ; they just ended up being far worse than expected . The White House has not said anything about the CGI contract publicly .
The company is also doing health care work in Colorado , Massachusetts , California and Kentucky . In the case of Kentucky , officials there reportedly say CGI , which is not the prime contractor on the job , has been `` great , '' helping to make Kentucky 's exchange one of the most successful in the country .
Representatives from CGI and other contractors working on the website project are scheduled to testify Thursday before the House Energy and Commerce Committee . In prepared testimony , CGI Federal 's Cheryl Campbell says that `` no amount of testing '' could `` adequately replicate a live environment of this nature . ''
But as more stories emerge that problems were anticipated well in advance of the Oct. 1 rollout , critics are naturally looking to the main contractor on the job for answers . CGI has already received $ 196 million to develop the new health care exchange , including the website , well over the initial $ 93 million contract , according to government documents .
The project was never put out to a full and open bidding process , but was limited to 16 candidates pre-qualified to do IT business for the government under what they call a `` Indefinite Delivery and Indefinite Quantity '' or ID/IQ , contracting vehicle . According to those same government documents , CGI was one of four that bid on the health exchange project .
Despite CGI 's problems in other states , the company has been doing big business with multiple agencies of the federal government since 2000 ( in 2004 CGI , acquired American Management Systems , which has been a government contractor since the late 1960 's ) . With that history , it was a virtual shoo-in for the job , experts said .
`` I think this is a huge problem with contracting in general -- the federal government is so dependent on these companies doing IT . Once you 've got your foot in the door , even if they do n't do a great job , you end up getting relied upon because ( the government ) has no one else to turn to , '' said Bill Allison , an investigator with the Sunlight Foundation , a non-profit watchdog group in Washington .
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) , which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) in charge of the health care exchange , did not return requests by FoxNews.com for comment .
The question arises whether the government was aware of the Hawaii or even the Canada issues when they hired CGI for the job .
`` They might not even have known , '' said Scott Amey , general counsel for the Project on Government Oversight , a Washington-based non-profit watchdog group . By all official accounts , CGI 's performance record at the federal level is `` clean . '' Contracting officers do n't always dig through local , state or international records to surmise a bidder 's performance . And if they do , records are n't always so transparent .
`` They should be aware of such cases , but generally they are not . ''
Bagnola suggested that CGI has been shrewd politically , giving to both Democrats and Republicans at both the state and federal levels . In the case of Hawaii , Bagnola said the company was able to continue to work on the DOTAX contract despite repeated complaints from management and a `` corrosive '' environment in which government employees felt pitted against CGI staff . This was noted in the final 2010 audit .
`` I do n't have an ax to grind here , except I was just trying to do my job for this team and stop the state of Hawaii from being ripped off , '' he said .
According to campaign records at OpenSecrets.com , CGI Group contributed $ 345,600 to federal candidates and parties -- both Democratic and Republican -- during the 2011-12 cycle . Some $ 147,000 went to the Republican Governors Association ; and $ 35,000 to the Democratic Governors Association . The company spent $ 400,000 in lobbying expenditures between 2011 and 2012 .","While the company behind the dysfunctional HealthCare.gov was virtually unknown to the American public until this month, critics say the Obama administration should have known this multibillion-dollar firm had a checkered history with other government contracts.

healthcare,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/7/16069112/bernie-sanders-obamacare-trumpcare,Inside Bernie Sanders’s campaign to save Obamacare,2017-08-07,"Jeff Stein, Julia Belluz, Sean Illing, Tara Golshan, Matthew Yglesias, Jason Del Rey, Shirin Ghaffary, Ella Nilsen","On three separate occasions this July , staffers for Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-VT ) began preparing for the rollout of his new single-payer health care bill .
But every time they started to do so , Senate Republicans would improbably revive their push to repeal Obamacare — and Sanders ’ s team would postpone the launch of their “ Medicare-for-all ” campaign , according to aides to the Vermont senator .
“ Bernie has repeated to us over and over and over again , ‘ Our top priority is doing everything in our power to make sure 20 million people don ’ t lose their health care , ’ ” said Ari Rabin-Havt , a senior adviser to Sanders .
This was something of a relief to some Democrats . Just last year , the party warily eyed Sanders as a potential liability as much as a potential ally . After all , he has repeatedly insisted that Obamacare was , at best , a way station on the road to single-payer .
“ Obamacare was a small victory for the uninsured , but it is time to take the fight against inadequate coverage even further , ” he said .
After the election , some feared the Vermont independent would continue to torch Obamacare ’ s inadequacies , while turning his passionate followers against the Democratic Party .
But at least during the Obamacare repeal fight in Congress , Sanders was a team player . He brought crowds to dozens of rallies with Senate Democrats who had once opposed him . He shut a Republican attempt to expose Democrats ’ divisions , despite the interest of some of his team . And , perhaps most importantly , he marshaled his resources and newfound star power in defense of Democrats ’ top priority : showing what it might look like for his movement to be incorporated into the party apparatus , rather than having it try to knock down its gates .
“ Our job today is to defend the Affordable Care Act , ” Sanders said at several of his rallies this year . `` Our job tomorrow is to create a Medicare-for-all single-payer system . ”
Sanders ’ s rallies with Democrats kick off a campaign to save Obamacare
The Vermont senator ’ s defense of the law didn ’ t come out of nowhere . In the early evening hours of December 9 , 2016 , roughly a dozen Sanders staffers crowded around a conference table in room 332 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building .
It was one of their first strategy meetings since the election . Sanders told them that they were being tasked with getting “ out in front ” of Republicans ’ health care agenda , according to aides who attended the meeting . At that point , nobody knew what Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would propose — or if he ’ d propose anything at all . Sanders said he wanted the assembled aides , including his chief of staff and senior aides , to preemptively plan on holding health care rallies in states across the country focused on defending the Affordable Care Act .
Sanders ’ s team left the meeting baffled by the request . One wondered how they were expected to draw crowds to rallies over an unknown bill . “ We walked out of it and said , ‘ How are we going to do this ? This is crazy , ’ ” one recalled .
They started in the freezing cold . On January 15 , as temperatures hit the low teens , Sanders joined Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ( NY ) and Michigan Sens . Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters onstage at Macomb County Community College . Eight thousand people showed up .
“ Sanders knew he had a unique megaphone in American politics , and he used it to shout it at the top of his lungs at a time when few were paying attention to the health care fight , ” said Ben Wikler , Washington director of MoveOn.org .
He kept shouting . In Portland , Maine , long before Sen. Susan Collins ( R-ME ) proved a crucial health care “ no ” vote , about 1,000 people watched Sanders decry the bill . After his favored candidate lost the contentious race to lead the Democratic National Committee , Sanders led an eight-state , 6,000-mile tour with new DNC Chair Tom Perez to kill “ Trumpcare. ” For two days in June , his team and its gray van traveled 348 miles in Appalachia to build public opposition to the Republican health bill .
Activists say that proved a crucial step in showing Democratic lawmakers that the public would join them in fighting for the ACA .
“ There were thousands of people at these rallies — in state after state after state after state . It was transformative for Democratic senators to see , ” said Wikler . “ They learned that people will show up , even in the bitter cold , to fight for the Affordable Care Act — which had once been written off as an unpopular and potentially doomed chunk of the Obama legacy . ”
As the debate over the Senate Republican bill stretched from one month to four , and then from four months to seven , Sanders resisted the temptation to make his whirlwind tour across the country primarily about single-payer health care .
“ Throughout this whole thing , there was always the temptation to pivot to make a stronger case for Medicare-for-all , rather than keeping the ACA at the center of our focus , ” one aide recalled . “ Bernie always insisted to us : ‘ No , no , no . ’ ”
In March , Sanders was already promising to “ soon ” announce his single-payer bill . It still hasn ’ t been released .
Republicans even tried to force the single-payer out of him . On July 26 , Sen. Steve Daines ( R-MT ) announced he would introduce a single-payer amendment in an upcoming vote-a-rama that he himself opposed . Daines ’ s amendment was an attempt to splinter the Democratic caucus , thereby exposing the minority party ’ s divisions on how to reform the health care system .
At least some members of Sanders ’ s team saw it as a golden opportunity .
“ There were definitely people — both inside and outside our office — who were saying , ‘ This is it ! This is what we 've been waiting for ! ’ ” one Sanders aide said .
After speaking with Schumer , Sanders himself shut down the idea , telling his staffers that they would not be going along with Daines ’ s gambit . Sanders and all but five Democratic senators abstained from the vote , and the story was quickly buried . “ Bernie ’ s instinct immediately was to say , ‘ We 're not going to engage on this , ’ ” according to the aide .
As Sanders barnstormed across the country to defend Obamacare , his rallies looked like a new fusion in the party — partly the Sanders faithful , but they were complemented by organizations and voters who had been faithful to Hillary Clinton too .
About 10 minutes after Sanders concluded one speech in downtown Pittsburgh in late June , Jared McCray and his sister remained behind the crowd . They looked out at the empty stage where Sanders had just stood .
“ This is about people ’ s lives , ” said McCray , echoing a line from Sanders ’ s speech .
Both had refused to support Clinton in the general election . “ We have no regrets ” about sitting out the election , said McCray , 24 , a touch defensively .
A few feet away from them stood Dean Ofran , 54 . A lifelong Pittsburgh resident , Ofran had voted for Clinton in the primary , though he said he harbored no animus toward the Vermont senator .
“ Of course I support single-payer — the primary wasn ’ t about that , ” Ofran said . “ I just didn ’ t think he could beat Trump . I still don ’ t think he could . ”
It was a similar story in West Virginia . In the crowd in Charleston , two young men — Sean McAllister , 18 , and Sean Hill , 17 — said they both cast write-in ballots for Sanders in the general election . Though they wouldn ’ t vote for Hillary Clinton , they had showed up to a rally to defend Obamacare , in part because they feared the impacts of the Republican bill ’ s Medicaid cuts . The “ Bernie or Bust ” voters who wouldn ’ t defend President Barack Obama ’ s legacy against Trump last November now , suddenly , were .
“ I ’ ve been trying to persuade my mom that she was misled by Trump and that Bernie wouldn ’ t betray her like this , ” Hill said .
The work behind the scenes also reflected how Sanders ’ s tour for Obamacare patched up the old party divisions , at least temporarily .
On the ground , Sanders ’ s campaign helped endear him to local Democrats who once implacably opposed his candidacy . “ There were a significant number of Clinton people who were there , ” said Joe Meyer , the mayor of Covington , in an interview about a Sanders rally in his city . “ They certainly didn ’ t stay home — and I think that tells you something . It shows the appeal of the message and the substance of the issue . ”
In late February , Sanders spoke at a dinner of the Kansas Democratic Party . He appeared onstage not just with Schumer and Stabenow , both of whom endorsed Clinton , but with Tom Perez and other Clinton backers such as Sens . Chris Van Hollen ( MD ) , Kamala Harris ( CA ) , Kirsten Gillibrand ( NY ) , and Chris Murphy ( CT ) .
Planned Parenthood endorsed Clinton in the primary , leading to an ugly public rift with Sanders in January 2016 . But during the Obamacare fight , the two were closely allied .

Sanders is now determined to transform his movement campaign to save Obamacare into one to pressure Democrats to embrace Medicare-for-all . On Wednesday , the Guardian ’ s Lauren Gambino reported that Sanders had started a six-figure digital advertising campaign on Facebook and Google to generate public “ co-sponsors ” of his single-payer bill . He ’ s sent a message to supporters asking for ideas about the plan , and is expected to soon hold rallies to push explicitly for Medicare-for-all .
Privately , Senate Democratic staffers were thankful that Sanders brought the “ outside game ” to Obamacare ’ s defense . But when he does so this September , it may not be as much to national Democrats ’ liking .
“ What you saw was a rising up of the American people , ” Sanders told Chris Hayes after Republicans failed to pass their bill . “ That ’ s why it was a victory . ”","On three separate occasions this July, staffers for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) began preparing for the rollout of his new single-payer health care bill.

But every time they started to do so, Senate Republicans would improbably revive their push to repeal Obamacare — and Sanders’s team would postpone the launch of their “Medicare-for-all” campaign, according to aides to the Vermont senator.

“Bernie has repeated to us over and over and over again, ‘Our top priority is doing everything in our power to make sure 20 million people don’t lose their health care,’” said Ari Rabin-Havt, a senior adviser to Sanders.

This was something of a relief to some Democrats. Just last year, the party warily eyed Sanders as a potential liability as much as a potential ally. After all, he has repeatedly insisted that Obamacare was, at best, a way station on the road to single-payer.

“Obamacare was a small victory for the uninsured, but it is time to take the fight against inadequate coverage even further,” he said.

After the election, some feared the Vermont independent would continue to torch Obamacare’s inadequacies, while turning his passionate followers against the Democratic Party.

But at least during the Obamacare repeal fight in Congress, Sanders was a team player. He brought crowds to dozens of rallies with Senate Democrats who had once opposed him. He shut a Republican attempt to expose Democrats’ divisions, despite the interest of some of his team. And, perhaps most importantly, he marshaled his resources and newfound star power in defense of Democrats’ top priority: showing what it might look like for his movement to be incorporated into the party apparatus, rather than having it try to knock down its gates.

“Our job today is to defend the Affordable Care Act,” Sanders said at several of his rallies this year. ""Our job tomorrow is to create a Medicare-for-all single-payer system.”

Sanders’s rallies with Democrats kick off a campaign to save Obamacare

The Vermont senator’s defense of the law didn’t come out of nowhere. In the early evening hours of December 9, 2016, roughly a dozen Sanders staffers crowded around a conference table in room 332 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building.

It was one of their first strategy meetings since the election. Sanders told them that they were being tasked with getting “out in front” of Republicans’ health care agenda, according to aides who attended the meeting. At that point, nobody knew what Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would propose — or if he’d propose anything at all. Sanders said he wanted the assembled aides, including his chief of staff and senior aides, to preemptively plan on holding health care rallies in states across the country focused on defending the Affordable Care Act.

Sanders’s team left the meeting baffled by the request. One wondered how they were expected to draw crowds to rallies over an unknown bill. “We walked out of it and said, ‘How are we going to do this? This is crazy,’” one recalled.

They started in the freezing cold. On January 15, as temperatures hit the low teens, Sanders joined Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (NY) and Michigan Sens. Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters onstage at Macomb County Community College. Eight thousand people showed up.

“Sanders knew he had a unique megaphone in American politics, and he used it to shout it at the top of his lungs at a time when few were paying attention to the health care fight,” said Ben Wikler, Washington director of MoveOn.org.

He kept shouting. In Portland, Maine, long before Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) proved a crucial health care “no” vote, about 1,000 people watched Sanders decry the bill. After his favored candidate lost the contentious race to lead the Democratic National Committee, Sanders led an eight-state, 6,000-mile tour with new DNC Chair Tom Perez to kill “Trumpcare.” For two days in June, his team and its gray van traveled 348 miles in Appalachia to build public opposition to the Republican health bill.

Activists say that proved a crucial step in showing Democratic lawmakers that the public would join them in fighting for the ACA.

“There were thousands of people at these rallies — in state after state after state after state. It was transformative for Democratic senators to see,” said Wikler. “They learned that people will show up, even in the bitter cold, to fight for the Affordable Care Act — which had once been written off as an unpopular and potentially doomed chunk of the Obama legacy.”

Resisting the single-payer temptation

As the debate over the Senate Republican bill stretched from one month to four, and then from four months to seven, Sanders resisted the temptation to make his whirlwind tour across the country primarily about single-payer health care.

“Throughout this whole thing, there was always the temptation to pivot to make a stronger case for Medicare-for-all, rather than keeping the ACA at the center of our focus,” one aide recalled. “Bernie always insisted to us: ‘No, no, no.’”

In March, Sanders was already promising to “soon” announce his single-payer bill. It still hasn’t been released.

Republicans even tried to force the single-payer out of him. On July 26, Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT) announced he would introduce a single-payer amendment in an upcoming vote-a-rama that he himself opposed. Daines’s amendment was an attempt to splinter the Democratic caucus, thereby exposing the minority party’s divisions on how to reform the health care system.

At least some members of Sanders’s team saw it as a golden opportunity.

“There were definitely people — both inside and outside our office — who were saying, ‘This is it! This is what we've been waiting for!’” one Sanders aide said.

After speaking with Schumer, Sanders himself shut down the idea, telling his staffers that they would not be going along with Daines’s gambit. Sanders and all but five Democratic senators abstained from the vote, and the story was quickly buried. “Bernie’s instinct immediately was to say, ‘We're not going to engage on this,’” according to the aide.

Using Sanders’s movement to defend Obama’s legacy

As Sanders barnstormed across the country to defend Obamacare, his rallies looked like a new fusion in the party — partly the Sanders faithful, but they were complemented by organizations and voters who had been faithful to Hillary Clinton too.

About 10 minutes after Sanders concluded one speech in downtown Pittsburgh in late June, Jared McCray and his sister remained behind the crowd. They looked out at the empty stage where Sanders had just stood.

“This is about people’s lives,” said McCray, echoing a line from Sanders’s speech.

Both had refused to support Clinton in the general election. “We have no regrets” about sitting out the election, said McCray, 24, a touch defensively.

A few feet away from them stood Dean Ofran, 54. A lifelong Pittsburgh resident, Ofran had voted for Clinton in the primary, though he said he harbored no animus toward the Vermont senator.

“Of course I support single-payer — the primary wasn’t about that,” Ofran said. “I just didn’t think he could beat Trump. I still don’t think he could.”

It was a similar story in West Virginia. In the crowd in Charleston, two young men — Sean McAllister, 18, and Sean Hill, 17 — said they both cast write-in ballots for Sanders in the general election. Though they wouldn’t vote for Hillary Clinton, they had showed up to a rally to defend Obamacare, in part because they feared the impacts of the Republican bill’s Medicaid cuts. The “Bernie or Bust” voters who wouldn’t defend President Barack Obama’s legacy against Trump last November now, suddenly, were.

“I’ve been trying to persuade my mom that she was misled by Trump and that Bernie wouldn’t betray her like this,” Hill said.

The work behind the scenes also reflected how Sanders’s tour for Obamacare patched up the old party divisions, at least temporarily.

On the ground, Sanders’s campaign helped endear him to local Democrats who once implacably opposed his candidacy. “There were a significant number of Clinton people who were there,” said Joe Meyer, the mayor of Covington, in an interview about a Sanders rally in his city. “They certainly didn’t stay home — and I think that tells you something. It shows the appeal of the message and the substance of the issue.”

In late February, Sanders spoke at a dinner of the Kansas Democratic Party. He appeared onstage not just with Schumer and Stabenow, both of whom endorsed Clinton, but with Tom Perez and other Clinton backers such as Sens. Chris Van Hollen (MD), Kamala Harris (CA), Kirsten Gillibrand (NY), and Chris Murphy (CT).

Planned Parenthood endorsed Clinton in the primary, leading to an ugly public rift with Sanders in January 2016. But during the Obamacare fight, the two were closely allied. Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards appeared with Sanders and Perez at a rally in Nevada, and Planned Parenthood volunteers stood alongside Sanders’s supporters at events around the country. In last Thursday’s rally outside the Capitol, Sanders returned the favor and specifically thanked Richards and Planned Parenthood — another sign that the party’s internal grievances had been patched up, at least as long as Senate Republicans’ bill hung overhead.

Sanders’s movement is becoming the Democratic Party

As Vox’s Matt Yglesias noted, Sanders is doing everything you’d expect him to do in order to run in 2020. He’s beefed up his Washington staff, is working to build a national organization called Our Revolution, and has held rallies across the country that still draw thousands of people.

Perhaps most importantly, he’s shifted some of his policy positions to the center, while also retaining what separates him from most national Democrats.

Lucas Rensko was making money through a popular handyman-for-hire app called TaskRabbit , doing odd jobs and delivering groceries , when he picked up a task that led him to a leaky-roofed warehouse on a tattered road in northwest San Antonio .
Inside , a man named Jaime Rivera had set up long tables where five or six other “ Taskers ” earning about $ 20 an hour were ripping Chinese masks out of plastic bags and stuffing them into new ones that were identical but for one potentially deadly difference . The old packages were labeled in all caps “ MEDICAL USE PROHIBITED , ” meaning not to be used by doctors and nurses who need the strongest protection from tiny particles carrying the novel coronavirus . The new bags , intended to make their way to Texas hospitals , simply omitted that warning .
This seemingly small deception highlights a huge problem for medical workers whose best defense against a virus that ravages the body with horrifying complexity is a simple , but trustworthy , mask . That trust has eroded as Chinese-made masks claiming , sometimes falsely , to be 95 % effective at filtering virus-laden particles made their way into hospitals and now local convenience stores . You might have bought them : KN95s .
Texas officials have tried to block ineffective masks from making their way to hospitals with screenings and by rejecting anything labeled as non-medical , yet at the same time , the mysterious brokers sourcing millions of masks were working hard to evade those safeguards . The operation Rensko witnessed had the potential to push faulty masks into the Texas supply chain just as Gov . Greg Abbott eased lockdown restrictions and COVID-19 infections began to soar .
“ He kind of takes us on this tour of his facility , which is essentially a shelled out warehouse , ” Rensko , 36 , told me over the phone , detailing how Rivera described the work at the warehouse . “ He was saying they were designated for personal or residential use , not for medical . And so what he was doing was basically putting them into other packaging where the city of San Antonio and the state of Texas are able to look at them and then sell them for medical purposes . ”
Rensko knew something wasn ’ t quite right and walked away from the TaskRabbit gig . He told his wife , who told a friend , who told another friend , who told me .
Over weeks of reporting , I ’ d learn that Rensko had scratched the surface of a larger scheme involving a Silicon Valley investor named Brennan Mulligan to sell what Texas health officials later flagged as “ fraudulent ” masks to the agency directing protective equipment to hospitals . Mulligan had enlisted Rivera , who was desperate for money after the pandemic had sapped his primary source of income , building furniture and manual labor via TaskRabbit . As countless others have , the two had a chance to make money off of the country ’ s public health nightmare .
When I caught up with Mulligan , he emphasized that he didn ’ t break any U.S. laws in his mask business . Rivera would acknowledge it was a gray area that had caught the attention of federal investigators . Both would defend their actions as simply cutting through onerous red tape put up by the Chinese and U.S. governments to get masks to those desperate for them .
The absurdity , greed and incompetence surrounding the distribution of coronavirus-era masks has taken me to Chicago , California and , now , Texas . The federal government ’ s efforts to get protective equipment out quickly to essential workers had failed spectacularly , and the supply chain that normally moves products from producers to vendors to end users had almost completely broken down . Counterfeit masks were flooding the market , and prices for even unreliable masks had skyrocketed .
I did what due diligence I could from my Washington , D.C. , apartment before buying a plane ticket . I researched Rivera and saw on Facebook that he was a father of six who danced in his driveway and camped on the beach with the kids .
But his Facebook page also told part of the supply-chain story . Rivera had posted several photos in late April of beaten up boxes bursting at the seams with masks labeled as KN95s , similar to the American-made N95 masks produced by 3M and other manufacturers . But the Chinese masks often don ’ t pass muster with U.S. regulators , who screen for effectiveness in blocking small particles and certify masks that meet their standards .
The masks Rivera posted photos of were face masks with earloops that don ’ t fit securely around the head , as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends . While the earloop-masks might offer some protection , the FDA warns that they ’ re not effective enough to be used in a medical setting .
The 6-foot stack of boxes were labeled as coming from a Chinese manufacturer , Guangzhou Aiyinmei Co. Ltd. , which had been identified by the FDA as one of the companies producing ineffective KN95s . The masks filter as little as 39 % of particles , according to testing by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . They ’ re so ineffective that Canada issued a recall . The FDA had hastily approved them and others for health care use at the beginning of the pandemic , but it changed its mind last month , even as millions of the masks circulated in the U.S .
Read More Masks Sold by Former White House Official to Navajo Hospitals Don ’ t Meet FDA Standards New information from the Indian Health Service calls into question why the agency purchased expensive medical gear that it now can not use as intended .
Rivera also posted an intriguing screenshot of a $ 2,000 payment he had received via Venmo , the person-to-person payment app , from a sender with the initials BM .
The payment memo read : “ 4/17 kn95 37.5 drop off and 50k hand-off … ”
“ A day ’ s work ! ” Rivera boasted about April 17 , the day he used a U-Haul rental truck to deliver nearly 100,000 masks to two buyers .
Beneath his Facebook post , a friend commented , “ Looks like code for a drug deal . ”
Back when I had friends and could go places , I used Venmo to split restaurant and bar tabs , sometimes offering cheeky comments that I mark as private so random people can ’ t see . But Rivera left all of his transactions and comments public , allowing anyone to see them on a smartphone . Venmo showed that Rivera ’ s payments from Mulligan , aka BM , included one for “ 131 boxes to TDEM , ” an acronym for the Texas Division of Emergency Management , the state ’ s version of the Federal Emergency Management Agency . TDEM supplies lifesaving gear to hospitals coping with COVID-19 cases .
Mulligan , the investor , also left his payments public . They showed that he and Rivera had paid several other people for services including deliveries of masks and “ repackaging . ”
Mulligan turned up in an internet scrub as a successful San Francisco businessman . He founded a company whose proprietary software allowed brands like Reebok and Nike to customize products , then sold that enterprise . He is now the CEO of SKYOU Inc. , a “ manufacture on demand ” business whose online 3D design software allows companies to create unique shirts and hoodies and have them shipped from China .
At first , it seemed odd that a tech entrepreneur would wade into mask trading , but it jibed with my previous reporting , which found that behind every mask sale , there ’ s a mystery investor .
After the mask supply crisis first surfaced , federal agencies and states went into business with nearly anyone who said they could deliver protective equipment . Masks were the first priority . Here and abroad , textile factories switched to stitching masks . Hundreds of new companies popped up and won government contracts , including some with shady records . My reporting found a high-end juicer salesman , a former state attorney general and dozens in the marijuana business who had become mask brokers .
Thus was born an unregulated market fueled by unprecedented scarcity and unending demand .
I met Rensko at a Starbucks around the corner from the warehouse where the mask operation went down . It was only 96 degrees , but it felt hotter , that first day Texans know that the weak spring is turning to summer scorch .
He said Rivera had called him the day after he walked away from the TaskRabbit gig . Rivera “ apologized , so he knew something was up . ”
Sweaty and caffeinated , we hopped into a Dodge minivan and whipped around the corner to the warehouse . Rivera wasn ’ t there , but two men stood outside talking — one peeking out of a blue taxi , the other gesturing emphatically with a bottle of cologne in one hand .
They told me they knew Rivera and had watched his mask repackaging operation come and go .
“ They just disappeared , ” said the man with the cologne , who wouldn ’ t provide his name . He said he had seen the mask operation in the warehouse next door for about two weeks , with U-Haul trucks coming in and out . The operators didn ’ t want him to come inside , he said .
The man said he met Mulligan and tried to set him up with a private buyer he knew , a guy named Sam . He wouldn ’ t give Sam ’ s last name , but I asked him to pass along my business card .
Lamenting the heat , the man spritzed the neckline of his blue Burberry shirt with the cologne he ’ d been holding , “ Obsession For Men . ”
“ It ’ s because I ’ m sweaty , ” he quipped , pointing next to his hands . “ Look , it works as hand sanitizer , too . ”
Rivera took my calls and originally agreed to meet in person , but he cut off communication as I asked more questions . In our first encounter , he said he met Mulligan innocuously on TaskRabbit in April and the two forged a business relationship .
After a few successful mask deliveries , Brennan and Rivera cut out the digital middleman and went into business directly , using Venmo as their money exchange .
“ So I went from picking up packages in San Antonio to Houston to Dallas to Austin , bringing them back over for processing and that ’ s pretty much it , ” he explained . By early May , Rivera said he was in charge of hiring workers and monitoring their hours .
Mulligan shipped boxes on a Southwest cargo jet for Rivera to pick up . Rivera shared some receipts : 94 boxes and 2,444 pounds of masks came in from Los Angeles on April 29 , an additional 52 boxes and 1,300 pounds on May 4 . Mulligan ships a few different brands , none of which were approved by the FDA for medical use , according to pictures Rivera shared .
Rivera described the repackaging operation as common sense . “ All we ’ re doing is we ’ re just omitting , ” he said . “ We ’ re taking off anything that says ‘ non-medical . ’ ”
He blamed China for the confusion . Mulligan told him that China was requiring that some mask batches be labeled non-medical , while other batches of the very same mask cleared export inspections without the disclaimer . Rivera said his workers were just clearing up the mess so states like Texas could buy masks without worry .
Without repackaging , state inspectors would simply see the warning and reject the shipment , he said .
“ Before it gets to the hospital level it has to get past the red tape , ” he said .
Rivera said he delivered more than a million SKYOU masks to Texas ’ emergency agency . Receipts Rivera shared also showed he was delivering to private companies that resell KN95s .
Rivera spoke of his work as a noble pursuit , that he was helping to deliver lifesaving gear to the front lines despite the federal government . The reason he was traversing Texas to meet cargo jets was because Mulligan had the shipments coming from different routes each time , through Minneapolis and Atlanta to Dallas or Houston for example , to evade FEMA , which was seizing masks to stop counterfeits and to shore up the national stockpile .
“ These masks are being taken and are being denied for arbitrary reasons , ” he said . “ Those are lives that are being impacted . ”
Read More Federal Agencies Have Spent Millions on KN95 Masks , Often Without Knowing Who Made Them Government employees at several agencies are relying on KN95 masks that the agencies can not guarantee offer the most protection . Some agencies have paid little attention to important manufacturing details and been tripped up by shifting regulations .
By mid-May the repackaging had stopped , Rivera said , in part because the warehouse was too small and “ there were leaks everywhere . ”
Rivera couldn ’ t explain why anyone needed to repackage masks if it weren ’ t to hide the medical use disclaimer . There seemed to be nothing stopping SKYOU from selling the masks to general consumers for non-medical uses , just the same as the patterned or branded cloth masks that are becoming a fashion statement .
It wasn ’ t until our fourth and final phone call that Rivera mentioned he and Mulligan had been contacted by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security .
“ His analogy was you ’ re telling somebody you have a Ferrari but you ’ re selling a Honda , ” Rivera said of his face-to-face chat with an investigator .
The investigator ’ s visit had led him to wonder if repackaging masks for sale to unsuspecting customers was not kosher .
That ’ s when I asked , “ Are you worried you were complicit in a crime ? ”
Before he hung up and cut off communication , he added : “ I ’ m not the brains of the operation , and I ’ m definitely not the wallet for it . ”
When I first contacted the Texas emergency agency , it said it hadn ’ t purchased any masks from either SKYOU or Mulligan . But when I sent over photos of KN95s that Rivera had shared with me and posted on Facebook , the agency recognized them .
A purchase order number on those beaten up boxes tracked to a different company , Eminent Commercial LLC , which landed a deal in mid-April to hunt down KN95s for as much as $ 6 a piece , more than six times what they cost before the pandemic . Eminent was essentially a master contractor , working with about a dozen subcontractors , including SKYOU , to ship in masks quickly .
TDEM canceled its deal with Eminent and its cadre of subcontractors May 20 “ because the products we were receiving were fraudulent , ” spokesman Seth Christensen said .
Christensen said TDEM weeds out bad masks during inspections at its San Antonio warehouse . It tests the filtration rate of sample masks from each shipment , a scientific safeguard many government agencies and hospitals lack .
Vendors with subpar products are turned away , he said , and don ’ t get paid . Anything labeled as non-medical use is instantly rejected , he said .
Brokers I talked with for this story described TDEM ’ s vetting process as far more rigorous than some federal agencies and many other states , raising concerns that faulty masks might be flowing freely elsewhere .
The agency shared a photo of a packaged mask SKYOU attempted to sell , which is identical to a photo Rivera shared , only with the medical disclaimer removed . The brand , Wentianchang , was never on the FDA ’ s list of masks approved for emergency use , according to the agency ’ s database .
Ted Coleman , Eminent ’ s owner , confirmed that Mulligan ’ s company had repeatedly tried to sell masks that didn ’ t pass the TDEM test . But SKYOU wasn ’ t alone .
“ We have had millions and millions of masks that were rejected by the state of Texas , ” Coleman said . “ Probably a total of 10 to 15 different vendors that were just sending us anything that they could send us in hopes of getting it accepted through TDEM . ”
Coleman said he tried to be “ the interceptor , ” making sure only masks that would pass testing got through . But he said Mulligan and Rivera went “ above and beyond ” to work around him and bring ineffective masks to the warehouse under Eminent ’ s deal .
Eminent was paid about $ 14.8 million for masks that TDEM accepted , according to Texas purchasing data , before the agency stopped ordering from the company . Coleman blames Mulligan for losing Texas ’ business .
He said Mulligan caused “ a very large scene ” with officials at the agency ’ s Austin headquarters after SKYOU masks were rejected .
Mulligan did not return calls , but in a few brief emails he expressed the same frustration I had heard from numerous importers , brokers and government agencies : The FDA inadvertently created a glut of subpar Chinese masks , which investors can ’ t sell and most governments can ’ t buy , by first permitting use of some Chinese masks , then reversing itself .
Meanwhile , Chinese officials required that some masks have disclaimers that they ’ re not for medical use — an attempt , brokers say , to avoid liability if bad masks allowed wearers to become sick .
Mulligan said companies like his got caught in limbo . Masks that Texas had accepted in April were suddenly rejected by May . Repackaging , he said , was the “ only solution , ” and he had been told other vendors were doing the same . He did not believe that the company broke U.S. laws , but that it probably broke Chinese customs law .
By the time Mulligan got all the masks repackaged , TDEM was no longer interested in buying from him .
While many of the masks that lost the FDA ’ s initial approval were purchased , including by the federal government , mask importers and brokers tell me millions more are collecting dust in storage .
As Mulligan would , investors with ineffective mask stockpiles are likely trying to find other ways to unload their product , potentially getting them to hospitals .
A Techie , an Embroiderer and a Tasker Walk Into an IHOP
I had to go to Houston to look into a guy who got a $ 10 million contract to supply COVID-19 testing tubes to FEMA and was instead delivering unusable tiny soda bottles . But before I left San Antonio , I wanted to follow up on what Mulligan ’ s warehouse neighbor , the guy with the cologne , said about another potential buyer : a guy named Sam .
Mulligan ’ s neighbor had alluded that Sam wasn ’ t far away , so I went to the warehouse and typed “ Sam ” into Google Maps and eventually came upon Samy ’ s Embroidery Club , just 8 miles away . It was worth checking out , since so many people in this trade seem to be either connected to apparel and textiles or the marijuana industry .
When I entered the shop , it was alive with the thrum of industrial sewing machines that stitched together baseball team jerseys , biker gang hats and , lately , face masks .
When I mentioned Mulligan , Sam , whose true name is Bassam Hasan , said through the noise that he had a strong vibe that something was off .
“ The guy , you could tell from the first minute he was hiding something , ” Hasan said .
Hasan said he had become a modest personal protective equipment supplier for the city of San Antonio and the local jail , and he was trying to find medical-grade masks to potentially sell to a hospital system in Illinois . His cousin , the guy with the cologne , hooked him up with Mulligan .
“ If they are 100 % approved , I said why not , ” he said .
According to text messages Hasan showed me , Mulligan offered a couple different brands of mask . “ ... they were on the CDC [ Emergency Use Authorization ] list before , ” one text from Mulligan ’ s number reads . “ They ’ ve since been removed so we can ’ t say whether they will meet the KN95 standard . ”
Mulligan “ wanted to do the deal immediately , ” Hasan said . “ This was like a million dollars , and I said you can ’ t do that . ”
Instead , on Memorial Day , Hasan met Mulligan and Rivera at an IHOP a couple blocks from the mask warehouse .
“ When he told me he was repackaging them , I was out , ” Hasan said . “ I ’ m not a little kid . I ’ ve been in business for 27 years . C ’ mon , man . This guy — I can tell you he ’ s not doing it right . ”
A photo shared by Brennan Mulligan shows boxes he said are masks in storage .
Hasan said he left the IHOP and stopped responding to Mulligan ’ s calls and texts .
In the end , Mulligan told me all the effort and expense of repackaging the masks was a waste . He shared photos of scores of boxes outside a self-storage locker , millions of masks he says he ’ s stuck with . He has since made his Venmo transactions private .
“ We did not sell ANY repackaged KN95s to TDEM or any other customers in the U.S. , ” he said .
If true , then the only people who made money on the repackaging shenanigans were Rivera and other Taskers he paid over a couple weeks .
Mulligan said SKYOU continues to sell hand sanitizer and fabric masks , but he ’ s given up on selling KN95s because they ’ re “ not worth the headaches . ”
A spokesperson with Homeland Security Investigations , HSI , responded to my inquiry about SKYOU and Rivera ’ s operation with a comment that left more questions than answers .
“ At this time , HSI , along with its law enforcement partners , is assessing these allegations in an effort to determine if any violations exist and/or if mishandling occurred , ” the statement said .

Lucas Rensko was making money through a popular handyman-for-hire app called TaskRabbit, doing odd jobs and delivering groceries, when he picked up a task that led him to a leaky-roofed warehouse on a tattered road in northwest San Antonio.

Inside, a man named Jaime Rivera had set up long tables where five or six other “Taskers” earning about $20 an hour were ripping Chinese masks out of plastic bags and stuffing them into new ones that were identical but for one potentially deadly difference. The old packages were labeled in all caps “MEDICAL USE PROHIBITED,” meaning not to be used by doctors and nurses who need the strongest protection from tiny particles carrying the novel coronavirus. The new bags, intended to make their way to Texas hospitals, simply omitted that warning.

This seemingly small deception highlights a huge problem for medical workers whose best defense against a virus that ravages the body with horrifying complexity is a simple, but trustworthy, mask. That trust has eroded as Chinese-made masks claiming, sometimes falsely, to be 95% effective at filtering virus-laden particles made their way into hospitals and now local convenience stores. You might have bought them: KN95s.

Help make sure our journalism is responsible and focused on the right issues. Note: If you develop emergency warning signs for COVID-19, such as difficulty breathing or bluish lips, get medical attention immediately. The CDC has more information on what to do if you are sick.

Texas officials have tried to block ineffective masks from making their way to hospitals with screenings and by rejecting anything labeled as non-medical, yet at the same time, the mysterious brokers sourcing millions of masks were working hard to evade those safeguards. The operation Rensko witnessed had the potential to push faulty masks into the Texas supply chain just as Gov. Greg Abbott eased lockdown restrictions and COVID-19 infections began to soar.

“He kind of takes us on this tour of his facility, which is essentially a shelled out warehouse,” Rensko, 36, told me over the phone, detailing how Rivera described the work at the warehouse. “He was saying they were designated for personal or residential use, not for medical. And so what he was doing was basically putting them into other packaging where the city of San Antonio and the state of Texas are able to look at them and then sell them for medical purposes.”

Rensko knew something wasn’t quite right and walked away from the TaskRabbit gig. He told his wife, who told a friend, who told another friend, who told me.

Over weeks of reporting, I’d learn that Rensko had scratched the surface of a larger scheme involving a Silicon Valley investor named Brennan Mulligan to sell what Texas health officials later flagged as “fraudulent” masks to the agency directing protective equipment to hospitals. Mulligan had enlisted Rivera, who was desperate for money after the pandemic had sapped his primary source of income, building furniture and manual labor via TaskRabbit. As countless others have, the two had a chance to make money off of the country’s public health nightmare.

When I caught up with Mulligan, he emphasized that he didn’t break any U.S. laws in his mask business. Rivera would acknowledge it was a gray area that had caught the attention of federal investigators. Both would defend their actions as simply cutting through onerous red tape put up by the Chinese and U.S. governments to get masks to those desperate for them.

The absurdity, greed and incompetence surrounding the distribution of coronavirus-era masks has taken me to Chicago, California and, now, Texas. The federal government’s efforts to get protective equipment out quickly to essential workers had failed spectacularly, and the supply chain that normally moves products from producers to vendors to end users had almost completely broken down. Counterfeit masks were flooding the market, and prices for even unreliable masks had skyrocketed.

I did what due diligence I could from my Washington, D.C., apartment before buying a plane ticket. I researched Rivera and saw on Facebook that he was a father of six who danced in his driveway and camped on the beach with the kids.

But his Facebook page also told part of the supply-chain story. Rivera had posted several photos in late April of beaten up boxes bursting at the seams with masks labeled as KN95s, similar to the American-made N95 masks produced by 3M and other manufacturers. But the Chinese masks often don’t pass muster with U.S. regulators, who screen for effectiveness in blocking small particles and certify masks that meet their standards.

The masks Rivera posted photos of were face masks with earloops that don’t fit securely around the head, as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends. While the earloop-masks might offer some protection, the FDA warns that they’re not effective enough to be used in a medical setting.

The 6-foot stack of boxes were labeled as coming from a Chinese manufacturer, Guangzhou Aiyinmei Co. Ltd., which had been identified by the FDA as one of the companies producing ineffective KN95s. The masks filter as little as 39% of particles, according to testing by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They’re so ineffective that Canada issued a recall. The FDA had hastily approved them and others for health care use at the beginning of the pandemic, but it changed its mind last month, even as millions of the masks circulated in the U.S.

Read More Masks Sold by Former White House Official to Navajo Hospitals Don’t Meet FDA Standards New information from the Indian Health Service calls into question why the agency purchased expensive medical gear that it now cannot use as intended.

Rivera also posted an intriguing screenshot of a $2,000 payment he had received via Venmo, the person-to-person payment app, from a sender with the initials BM.

The payment memo read: “4/17 kn95 37.5 drop off and 50k hand-off …”

“A day’s work!” Rivera boasted about April 17, the day he used a U-Haul rental truck to deliver nearly 100,000 masks to two buyers.

Beneath his Facebook post, a friend commented, “Looks like code for a drug deal.”

Back when I had friends and could go places, I used Venmo to split restaurant and bar tabs, sometimes offering cheeky comments that I mark as private so random people can’t see. But Rivera left all of his transactions and comments public, allowing anyone to see them on a smartphone. Venmo showed that Rivera’s payments from Mulligan, aka BM, included one for “131 boxes to TDEM,” an acronym for the Texas Division of Emergency Management, the state’s version of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. TDEM supplies lifesaving gear to hospitals coping with COVID-19 cases.

Mulligan, the investor, also left his payments public. They showed that he and Rivera had paid several other people for services including deliveries of masks and “repackaging.”

Mulligan turned up in an internet scrub as a successful San Francisco businessman. He founded a company whose proprietary software allowed brands like Reebok and Nike to customize products, then sold that enterprise. He is now the CEO of SKYOU Inc., a “manufacture on demand” business whose online 3D design software allows companies to create unique shirts and hoodies and have them shipped from China.

At first, it seemed odd that a tech entrepreneur would wade into mask trading, but it jibed with my previous reporting, which found that behind every mask sale, there’s a mystery investor.

After the mask supply crisis first surfaced, federal agencies and states went into business with nearly anyone who said they could deliver protective equipment. Masks were the first priority. Here and abroad, textile factories switched to stitching masks. Hundreds of new companies popped up and won government contracts, including some with shady records. My reporting found a high-end juicer salesman, a former state attorney general and dozens in the marijuana business who had become mask brokers.

Thus was born an unregulated market fueled by unprecedented scarcity and unending demand.

The Lone Star State

I met Rensko at a Starbucks around the corner from the warehouse where the mask operation went down. It was only 96 degrees, but it felt hotter, that first day Texans know that the weak spring is turning to summer scorch.

He said Rivera had called him the day after he walked away from the TaskRabbit gig. Rivera “apologized, so he knew something was up.”

Sweaty and caffeinated, we hopped into a Dodge minivan and whipped around the corner to the warehouse. Rivera wasn’t there, but two men stood outside talking — one peeking out of a blue taxi, the other gesturing emphatically with a bottle of cologne in one hand.

They told me they knew Rivera and had watched his mask repackaging operation come and go.

“They just disappeared,” said the man with the cologne, who wouldn’t provide his name. He said he had seen the mask operation in the warehouse next door for about two weeks, with U-Haul trucks coming in and out. The operators didn’t want him to come inside, he said.

The man said he met Mulligan and tried to set him up with a private buyer he knew, a guy named Sam. He wouldn’t give Sam’s last name, but I asked him to pass along my business card.

Lamenting the heat, the man spritzed the neckline of his blue Burberry shirt with the cologne he’d been holding, “Obsession For Men.”

“It’s because I’m sweaty,” he quipped, pointing next to his hands. “Look, it works as hand sanitizer, too.”

“We’re Taking Off Anything That Says ‘Non-medical’”

Rivera took my calls and originally agreed to meet in person, but he cut off communication as I asked more questions. In our first encounter, he said he met Mulligan innocuously on TaskRabbit in April and the two forged a business relationship.

After a few successful mask deliveries, Brennan and Rivera cut out the digital middleman and went into business directly, using Venmo as their money exchange.

“So I went from picking up packages in San Antonio to Houston to Dallas to Austin, bringing them back over for processing and that’s pretty much it,” he explained. By early May, Rivera said he was in charge of hiring workers and monitoring their hours.

Mulligan shipped boxes on a Southwest cargo jet for Rivera to pick up. Rivera shared some receipts: 94 boxes and 2,444 pounds of masks came in from Los Angeles on April 29, an additional 52 boxes and 1,300 pounds on May 4. Mulligan ships a few different brands, none of which were approved by the FDA for medical use, according to pictures Rivera shared.

Rivera described the repackaging operation as common sense. “All we’re doing is we’re just omitting,” he said. “We’re taking off anything that says ‘non-medical.’”

He blamed China for the confusion. Mulligan told him that China was requiring that some mask batches be labeled non-medical, while other batches of the very same mask cleared export inspections without the disclaimer. Rivera said his workers were just clearing up the mess so states like Texas could buy masks without worry.

Without repackaging, state inspectors would simply see the warning and reject the shipment, he said.

“Before it gets to the hospital level it has to get past the red tape,” he said.

Rivera said he delivered more than a million SKYOU masks to Texas’ emergency agency. Receipts Rivera shared also showed he was delivering to private companies that resell KN95s.

Rivera spoke of his work as a noble pursuit, that he was helping to deliver lifesaving gear to the front lines despite the federal government. The reason he was traversing Texas to meet cargo jets was because Mulligan had the shipments coming from different routes each time, through Minneapolis and Atlanta to Dallas or Houston for example, to evade FEMA, which was seizing masks to stop counterfeits and to shore up the national stockpile.

“These masks are being taken and are being denied for arbitrary reasons,” he said. “Those are lives that are being impacted.”

Read More Federal Agencies Have Spent Millions on KN95 Masks, Often Without Knowing Who Made Them Government employees at several agencies are relying on KN95 masks that the agencies cannot guarantee offer the most protection. Some agencies have paid little attention to important manufacturing details and been tripped up by shifting regulations.

By mid-May the repackaging had stopped, Rivera said, in part because the warehouse was too small and “there were leaks everywhere.”

Rivera couldn’t explain why anyone needed to repackage masks if it weren’t to hide the medical use disclaimer. There seemed to be nothing stopping SKYOU from selling the masks to general consumers for non-medical uses, just the same as the patterned or branded cloth masks that are becoming a fashion statement.

It wasn’t until our fourth and final phone call that Rivera mentioned he and Mulligan had been contacted by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

“His analogy was you’re telling somebody you have a Ferrari but you’re selling a Honda,” Rivera said of his face-to-face chat with an investigator.

The investigator’s visit had led him to wonder if repackaging masks for sale to unsuspecting customers was not kosher.

That’s when I asked, “Are you worried you were complicit in a crime?”

“The more we talk about it, yes,” he said.

Before he hung up and cut off communication, he added: “I’m not the brains of the operation, and I’m definitely not the wallet for it.”

Whiplash in the Mask Market

When I first contacted the Texas emergency agency, it said it hadn’t purchased any masks from either SKYOU or Mulligan. But when I sent over photos of KN95s that Rivera had shared with me and posted on Facebook, the agency recognized them.

A purchase order number on those beaten up boxes tracked to a different company, Eminent Commercial LLC, which landed a deal in mid-April to hunt down KN95s for as much as $6 a piece, more than six times what they cost before the pandemic. Eminent was essentially a master contractor, working with about a dozen subcontractors, including SKYOU, to ship in masks quickly.

TDEM canceled its deal with Eminent and its cadre of subcontractors May 20 “because the products we were receiving were fraudulent,” spokesman Seth Christensen said.

Christensen said TDEM weeds out bad masks during inspections at its San Antonio warehouse. It tests the filtration rate of sample masks from each shipment, a scientific safeguard many government agencies and hospitals lack.

Vendors with subpar products are turned away, he said, and don’t get paid. Anything labeled as non-medical use is instantly rejected, he said.

Brokers I talked with for this story described TDEM’s vetting process as far more rigorous than some federal agencies and many other states, raising concerns that faulty masks might be flowing freely elsewhere.

The agency shared a photo of a packaged mask SKYOU attempted to sell, which is identical to a photo Rivera shared, only with the medical disclaimer removed. The brand, Wentianchang, was never on the FDA’s list of masks approved for emergency use, according to the agency’s database.

Ted Coleman, Eminent’s owner, confirmed that Mulligan’s company had repeatedly tried to sell masks that didn’t pass the TDEM test. But SKYOU wasn’t alone.

“We have had millions and millions of masks that were rejected by the state of Texas,” Coleman said. “Probably a total of 10 to 15 different vendors that were just sending us anything that they could send us in hopes of getting it accepted through TDEM.”

Coleman said he tried to be “the interceptor,” making sure only masks that would pass testing got through. But he said Mulligan and Rivera went “above and beyond” to work around him and bring ineffective masks to the warehouse under Eminent’s deal.

Eminent was paid about $14.8 million for masks that TDEM accepted, according to Texas purchasing data, before the agency stopped ordering from the company. Coleman blames Mulligan for losing Texas’ business.

He said Mulligan caused “a very large scene” with officials at the agency’s Austin headquarters after SKYOU masks were rejected.

Mulligan did not return calls, but in a few brief emails he expressed the same frustration I had heard from numerous importers, brokers and government agencies: The FDA inadvertently created a glut of subpar Chinese masks, which investors can’t sell and most governments can’t buy, by first permitting use of some Chinese masks, then reversing itself.

Meanwhile, Chinese officials required that some masks have disclaimers that they’re not for medical use — an attempt, brokers say, to avoid liability if bad masks allowed wearers to become sick.

Mulligan said companies like his got caught in limbo. Masks that Texas had accepted in April were suddenly rejected by May. Repackaging, he said, was the “only solution,” and he had been told other vendors were doing the same. He did not believe that the company broke U.S. laws, but that it probably broke Chinese customs law.

By the time Mulligan got all the masks repackaged, TDEM was no longer interested in buying from him.

While many of the masks that lost the FDA’s initial approval were purchased, including by the federal government, mask importers and brokers tell me millions more are collecting dust in storage.

As Mulligan would, investors with ineffective mask stockpiles are likely trying to find other ways to unload their product, potentially getting them to hospitals.

A Techie, an Embroiderer and a Tasker Walk Into an IHOP

I had to go to Houston to look into a guy who got a $10 million contract to supply COVID-19 testing tubes to FEMA and was instead delivering unusable tiny soda bottles. But before I left San Antonio, I wanted to follow up on what Mulligan’s warehouse neighbor, the guy with the cologne, said about another potential buyer: a guy named Sam.

Mulligan’s neighbor had alluded that Sam wasn’t far away, so I went to the warehouse and typed “Sam” into Google Maps and eventually came upon Samy’s Embroidery Club, just 8 miles away. It was worth checking out, since so many people in this trade seem to be either connected to apparel and textiles or the marijuana industry.

When I entered the shop, it was alive with the thrum of industrial sewing machines that stitched together baseball team jerseys, biker gang hats and, lately, face masks.

When I mentioned Mulligan, Sam, whose true name is Bassam Hasan, said through the noise that he had a strong vibe that something was off.

“The guy, you could tell from the first minute he was hiding something,” Hasan said.

Hasan said he had become a modest personal protective equipment supplier for the city of San Antonio and the local jail, and he was trying to find medical-grade masks to potentially sell to a hospital system in Illinois. His cousin, the guy with the cologne, hooked him up with Mulligan.

“If they are 100% approved, I said why not,” he said.

According to text messages Hasan showed me, Mulligan offered a couple different brands of mask. “... they were on the CDC [Emergency Use Authorization] list before,” one text from Mulligan’s number reads. “They’ve since been removed so we can’t say whether they will meet the KN95 standard.”

Mulligan “wanted to do the deal immediately,” Hasan said. “This was like a million dollars, and I said you can’t do that.”

Instead, on Memorial Day, Hasan met Mulligan and Rivera at an IHOP a couple blocks from the mask warehouse.

“When he told me he was repackaging them, I was out,” Hasan said. “I’m not a little kid. I’ve been in business for 27 years. C’mon, man. This guy — I can tell you he’s not doing it right.”

A photo shared by Brennan Mulligan shows boxes he said are masks in storage.

Hasan said he left the IHOP and stopped responding to Mulligan’s calls and texts.

In the end, Mulligan told me all the effort and expense of repackaging the masks was a waste. He shared photos of scores of boxes outside a self-storage locker, millions of masks he says he’s stuck with. He has since made his Venmo transactions private.

“We did not sell ANY repackaged KN95s to TDEM or any other customers in the U.S.,” he said.

If true, then the only people who made money on the repackaging shenanigans were Rivera and other Taskers he paid over a couple weeks.

Mulligan said SKYOU continues to sell hand sanitizer and fabric masks, but he’s given up on selling KN95s because they’re “not worth the headaches.”

A spokesperson with Homeland Security Investigations, HSI, responded to my inquiry about SKYOU and Rivera’s operation with a comment that left more questions than answers.

“At this time, HSI, along with its law enforcement partners, is assessing these allegations in an effort to determine if any violations exist and/or if mishandling occurred,” the statement said.

Today , pharmaceutical industry executives set the prices that Americans pay for drugs with their own profits in mind , rather than based on how well the drug works . Surveys show that roughly two-thirds of Americans—including majorities of Democrats , Republicans , and Independents—support government action to make prescription drugs more affordable .
This issue brief builds on the ███ ’ previous drug pricing proposals and outlines a framework to establish a negotiation process for Medicare and private health care payers . This approach incorporates comparative effectiveness research , or CER , which compares the clinical benefits of two or more treatment alternatives , such as prescription drugs . Backing up these negotiations with the prospect of binding arbitration would empower Medicare and private payers to negotiate drug prices effectively . The Congressional Budget Office has said that Medicare would lack sufficient leverage to negotiate lower prices effectively absent additional policy changes , such as permitting Medicare to establish a formulary , or list of covered drugs . Under this proposal , the existence of the arbitration process would provide the needed leverage for Medicare without the need to develop a formulary .
It is also important to make sure that insurers and other health care payers pass along the savings from these negotiations to consumers . For this reason , drugs with value-based prices will have preferential cost sharing so that patients will be able to afford their medications . And by increasing the prevalence and usage of CER , this framework will also give doctors more information about clinical benefits of the drugs they prescribe , which will help them select the best treatments for their patients .
Under the new negotiation framework , a drug manufacturer would continue to set the price for a drug after it receives approval from the Food and Drug Administration , or FDA , as is currently the case . During the first three months following FDA approval , the secretary of health and human services could decide to refer the drug for comparative effectiveness research review . In determining whether to do so , she would take into account the drug ’ s current price , prevalence and usage , approved indications , and the number of alternative treatments for each approved use .
The review would be conducted separately by two different certified research organizations , which would be selected automatically from a rotation of qualifying organizations . These organizations would have been previously certified by the secretary ; they must be independent , free of any conflicts of interest , and have a transparent methodology that can be reviewed by third parties . They should be nonprofits governed by a board that includes representatives from payers , patients , drug manufacturers , and consumer groups . Moreover , in certifying a CER organization , the secretary should consider groups with different CER methodologies .
Once a drug is selected for review , its manufacturer would be required to submit any existing internal comparative effectiveness data to the certified organizations . These include any data that the manufacturer has sent to foreign regulators as part of the drug approval or pricing processes in other countries . Manufacturers may also use this opportunity to submit any additional data they wish to include .
Nine months after the submission of these data to the certified comparative effectiveness research organizations , the organizations would release a draft price recommendation report . Based on the drug ’ s comparative effectiveness , the report would categorize the drug in terms of whether it provides no added benefit , minor added benefit , or significant added benefit compared with alternative treatments . Added benefits would include improved health status , shortened disease duration , extended life expectancy , reduced side effects , and improved quality of life .
Following publication of the draft report , there would be a 90-day public comment period . The certified organizations would release a final report after considering these comments . If a certified organization felt that additional CER trials were necessary to determine the level of added benefit , then it could petition the secretary for additional time before releasing the draft report .
The report must also include a recommended price for the drug , based on its level of clinical benefit . For most drugs , this will be presented as the average manufacturer price , or AMP , for the standard course of treatment . AMP represents the average price paid by wholesalers or retail pharmacies to drug manufacturers for a drug . The report would use AMP instead of a drug ’ s list price or the average sales price , since list prices do not necessarily correspond to the prices actually paid , and average sales price is generally only calculated for drugs covered by Medicare Part B . For drugs that treat chronic conditions , it would be the average price for one year of treatment .
This CER review and price recommendation process would be funded by reallocating and eventually renewing the fee on insurers that partially funds the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute , or PCORI . In addition , the proposal would require that drug manufacturers pay an equivalent fee . PCORI would be eligible to apply for certification as one of the CER organizations .
Since two separate organizations would be issuing price recommendations for each referred drug , these two prices would form the recommended price range . This price range , as well as the additional comparative effectiveness research data and the CER organizations ’ reports , will give health care payers additional information to inform their negotiations with the drug industry . All payers—including Medicare—could negotiate with drug corporations about the price of a drug .
If the drug ’ s price were already within the recommended range , or if payers were able to negotiate the price to a level within the range , no additional steps would be necessary . In these cases , since the drug ’ s price reflects its benefit to patients , the payer must give the drug preferential cost sharing to consumers .
If , after negotiations , the price offered to the payer is higher than the recommended range , the drug manufacturer must submit to the secretary detailed information about its pricing decision within three months . This information would be posted publicly and include a consumer-friendly report on the following : A justification for the company ’ s list price ; detailed data on patient utilization ; the costs of manufacturing the drug ; the costs of developing the drug ; the costs of marketing the drug ; the profits the company has made and expected to make from the drug ; the company ’ s lobbying expenditures ; the company ’ s CEO pay ; the company ’ s campaign contributions ; and the company ’ s spending on patient assistance programs—both by itself and through charities and other third parties—for the drug .
Moreover , any payer—including Medicare—could request binding arbitration if the price following negotiation remains outside the range .
Once a payer requests arbitration , an arbitrator would be selected from a predetermined list . The Government Accountability Office would create the list of arbitrators , and the final arbitrator would be selected by each party taking turns striking out arbitrators until there is one arbitrator left . Arbitrators must not have financial or personal conflicts of interest . The arbitrator would have access to all of the CER and transparency data , as well as to proposed prices from the two independent organizations and the drug manufacturers .
Absent a settlement , the arbitrator would determine the price . At any time during arbitration , the manufacturer could submit further information and documentation to support its case . If a drug has already been the subject of arbitration for one payer but a subsequent payer is also unable to negotiate a value-based price and requests arbitration , then the final price from the first arbitration process will be used .
Of course , the pricing decision made by pharmaceutical executives at a drug ’ s launch is not the only relevant factor . As shown by the recent controversy over Mylan executives ’ decision to repeatedly increase the price for EpiPens , drug corporations often exploit market conditions to increase prices for existing drugs dramatically , despite the drug itself remaining the same .
For this reason , the negotiation-arbitration framework would not stop after the initial price report and negotiations . After the third year , the secretary may , at her discretion , restart the process by re-referring a drug to the independent organizations for additional review . Some things that might prompt the secretary to do this include significant price increases , the availability of new treatments , or new evidence of a drug ’ s effectiveness . For example , a second review could be triggered by pharmaceutical executives ’ decision to increase the price of their drugs by more than the Consumer Price Index plus 1 percentage point .
This framework would establish a pro-patient , value-based system for drug pricing . It would accomplish this goal by empowering Medicare and private payers to negotiate drug prices more effectively , while also addressing egregious price increases on existing drugs . Furthermore , it would give doctors more information about the clinical effectiveness of different treatment options and increase patient access to critical medicines by making these treatments more affordable . The government must act to give patients what they deserve : a drug pricing framework that puts their needs above drug corporations ’ bottom lines .

The review would be conducted separately by two different certified research organizations, which would be selected automatically from a rotation of qualifying organizations. These organizations would have been previously certified by the secretary; they must be independent, free of any conflicts of interest, and have a transparent methodology that can be reviewed by third parties. They should be nonprofits governed by a board that includes representatives from payers, patients, drug manufacturers, and consumer groups. Moreover, in certifying a CER organization, the secretary should consider groups with different CER methodologies.

Once a drug is selected for review, its manufacturer would be required to submit any existing internal comparative effectiveness data to the certified organizations. These include any data that the manufacturer has sent to foreign regulators as part of the drug approval or pricing processes in other countries. Manufacturers may also use this opportunity to submit any additional data they wish to include.

Step 2: Price recommendation report

Nine months after the submission of these data to the certified comparative effectiveness research organizations, the organizations would release a draft price recommendation report. Based on the drug’s comparative effectiveness, the report would categorize the drug in terms of whether it provides no added benefit, minor added benefit, or significant added benefit compared with alternative treatments. Added benefits would include improved health status, shortened disease duration, extended life expectancy, reduced side effects, and improved quality of life.

Following publication of the draft report, there would be a 90-day public comment period. The certified organizations would release a final report after considering these comments. If a certified organization felt that additional CER trials were necessary to determine the level of added benefit, then it could petition the secretary for additional time before releasing the draft report.

The report must also include a recommended price for the drug, based on its level of clinical benefit. For most drugs, this will be presented as the average manufacturer price, or AMP, for the standard course of treatment. AMP represents the average price paid by wholesalers or retail pharmacies to drug manufacturers for a drug. The report would use AMP instead of a drug’s list price or the average sales price, since list prices do not necessarily correspond to the prices actually paid, and average sales price is generally only calculated for drugs covered by Medicare Part B. For drugs that treat chronic conditions, it would be the average price for one year of treatment.

This CER review and price recommendation process would be funded by reallocating and eventually renewing the fee on insurers that partially funds the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, or PCORI. In addition, the proposal would require that drug manufacturers pay an equivalent fee. PCORI would be eligible to apply for certification as one of the CER organizations.

Step 3: Public- and private-sector negotiations

Since two separate organizations would be issuing price recommendations for each referred drug, these two prices would form the recommended price range. This price range, as well as the additional comparative effectiveness research data and the CER organizations’ reports, will give health care payers additional information to inform their negotiations with the drug industry. All payers—including Medicare—could negotiate with drug corporations about the price of a drug.

If the drug’s price were already within the recommended range, or if payers were able to negotiate the price to a level within the range, no additional steps would be necessary. In these cases, since the drug’s price reflects its benefit to patients, the payer must give the drug preferential cost sharing to consumers.

If, after negotiations, the price offered to the payer is higher than the recommended range, the drug manufacturer must submit to the secretary detailed information about its pricing decision within three months. This information would be posted publicly and include a consumer-friendly report on the following: A justification for the company’s list price; detailed data on patient utilization; the costs of manufacturing the drug; the costs of developing the drug; the costs of marketing the drug; the profits the company has made and expected to make from the drug; the company’s lobbying expenditures; the company’s CEO pay; the company’s campaign contributions; and the company’s spending on patient assistance programs—both by itself and through charities and other third parties—for the drug.

Moreover, any payer—including Medicare—could request binding arbitration if the price following negotiation remains outside the range.

Once a payer requests arbitration, an arbitrator would be selected from a predetermined list. The Government Accountability Office would create the list of arbitrators, and the final arbitrator would be selected by each party taking turns striking out arbitrators until there is one arbitrator left. Arbitrators must not have financial or personal conflicts of interest. The arbitrator would have access to all of the CER and transparency data, as well as to proposed prices from the two independent organizations and the drug manufacturers.

Absent a settlement, the arbitrator would determine the price. At any time during arbitration, the manufacturer could submit further information and documentation to support its case. If a drug has already been the subject of arbitration for one payer but a subsequent payer is also unable to negotiate a value-based price and requests arbitration, then the final price from the first arbitration process will be used.

Step 4: Protecting against excessive price increases

Of course, the pricing decision made by pharmaceutical executives at a drug’s launch is not the only relevant factor. As shown by the recent controversy over Mylan executives’ decision to repeatedly increase the price for EpiPens, drug corporations often exploit market conditions to increase prices for existing drugs dramatically, despite the drug itself remaining the same.

For this reason, the negotiation-arbitration framework would not stop after the initial price report and negotiations. After the third year, the secretary may, at her discretion, restart the process by re-referring a drug to the independent organizations for additional review. Some things that might prompt the secretary to do this include significant price increases, the availability of new treatments, or new evidence of a drug’s effectiveness. For example, a second review could be triggered by pharmaceutical executives’ decision to increase the price of their drugs by more than the Consumer Price Index plus 1 percentage point.

Conclusion

This framework would establish a pro-patient, value-based system for drug pricing. It would accomplish this goal by empowering Medicare and private payers to negotiate drug prices more effectively, while also addressing egregious price increases on existing drugs. Furthermore, it would give doctors more information about the clinical effectiveness of different treatment options and increase patient access to critical medicines by making these treatments more affordable. The government must act to give patients what they deserve: a drug pricing framework that puts their needs above drug corporations’ bottom lines.

The analysis set off a furious debate in Washington . The White House argued that the reduction is positive because it means Americans will forgo jobs or extra work to stay home with their children or strike out on their own as entrepreneurs . Republicans , however , said the report amounted to an “ I told you so ” moment and that subtracting the equivalent of 2 million workers can ’ t be good for the economy .
The CBO said the number of workers dropping out of the labor force will grow from 2 million in 2017 to 2.5 million by 2024 .
Although part of those numbers are attributed to job cuts , the vast majority represent workers who decide it makes more sense to stay home or work fewer hours , weighing the higher taxes they pay in the workforce versus their qualifications for benefits if they drop out .
“ CBO estimates that the ACA will reduce the total number of hours worked , on net , by about 1.5 to 2 percent during the period from 2017 to 2024 , almost entirely because workers will choose to supply less labor — given the new taxes and other incentives they will face and the financial benefits some will receive , ” the nonpartisan tax agency said in its economic outlook .
The CBO also said the Affordable Care Act ’ s exchanges will enroll 6 million people by the first deadline in March , which is 1 million fewer than earlier projections . But by the end of the decade , the number of people without insurance coverage will have dropped from 45 million today to 30 million , the agency said in its annual update on the economic and budget outlook .

White House chief economic adviser Jason Furman said the health care law is about giving workers more choices . He compared it to Social Security and Medicare , which he said gave senior citizens the incentives and financial wherewithal to retire .
In this case , he said , the CBO ’ s numbers show that the health care law will let younger workers make decisions about whether to remain in the workforce .
“ Maybe a spouse who wanted to be part-time so they could spend more time with their family now is able to do that , ” Mr. Furman told reporters . “ Somebody else who wanted to start a business and become an entrepreneur and was terrified of doing it because they ’ d lose their health insurance , is now able to do that too , and switch and take a chance on creating jobs and growing the overall economy . So there ’ s a lot of new choices that this will facilitate . ”
At the same time , Mr. Furman said he doesn ’ t agree with the CBO ’ s numbers . He argues that agency analysts didn ’ t take into account lower health care costs and higher worker productivity that would create hundreds of thousands of jobs a year .
Republicans , though , used the jobs number to attack Senate Democrats seeking re-election in November .
“ This is one of the perverse incentives in this terrible law . It actually encourages able-bodied people to not work , ” said Sen. John Barrasso , Wyoming Republican . “ We should be doing all that we can to increase labor force participation . The health care law actually pushes it in the opposite direction . ”

(CNN) – The Republican divide over whether to shut down the federal government in a bid to end President Barack Obama's health care law is merely a tactical split, rather than a larger ideological rift, the party's national chairman said Sunday.

John McCain and Tom Coburn, as well as last year's GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who told a crowd of Republican donors in New Hampshire last week that ""the people of the nation would not be happy"" if Republicans help trigger a shutdown.

House Majority Leader Eric Cantor has also tamped down on talk of government shutdown threats, saying in an interview with the National Review that ""no one is advocating a government shutdown.""

But in Iowa, Cruz's calls for defunding Obamacare were met with enthusiastic applause - something he said was unlikely to be replicated in Washington.

House Speaker John Boehner welcomed Obama's apology but said he should back a legislative fix if he's really serious. The House will vote next week to allow anyone with an individual health care plan they like to keep it.

Some have suggested Obama agree to extend the March 31 Obamacare signup deadline.

Others like Sens. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, and Mark Kirk, an Illinois Republican, have introduced legislation to delay by a year the tax penalty for people who choose to go without insurance and are not covered by Medicaid or other government insurance program.

The Manchin-Kirk bill would prevent any penalty before January 1, 2015.

The sign-up issue does not impact most Americans with health insurance because they have coverage through an employer.

During a conference call with House Democratic leaders on Friday, some members back home this past week said they got a lot of questions about cancellations from constituents, according to one aide. There was no discussion about potential fixes.

Online woes, effort to fix

The October 1 rollout of the federal HealthCare.gov where consumers could shop around and enroll in Obamacare plans on privately run health exchanges was a debacle.

Fundamental technical issues prevented people -- including Obama at one point -- from even signing onto the HealthCare.gov site.

In the NBC interview, Obama reiterated that he's ""confident"" a ""majority of people"" will be able to use the website and apply for insurance by November 30.

In an update, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) said on Friday it is still prone to errors and slow response times, but it has improved since its disastrous launch.

A key part of the site will be down over the Veterans Day weekend, including Monday, CMS spokeswoman Julie Bataille said.

Jeffrey Zients, the management consultant and once and future White House staffer brought in to oversee fixes, said the outage will allow administrators to work through more issues.

Separately, House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa on Friday subpoenaed White House technology officer Todd Park to testify next Wednesday. But the White House said he is busy trying to help fix the Obamacare website and doesn't have time to appear now.

Also, CMS Administrator Marilyn Tavenner told the House Ways and Means Committee the agency expects to finalize the latest enrollment-related data ""shortly"" and will provide that information to the panel next week.

The deadline for that information under a Ways and Means Committee subpoena was Friday.

""We value our working relationship with the committee, and are actively working to coordinate and reconcile enrollment-related information from different sources and collect data from states.

Top aides to the president said that , although Mr. Obama never mentioned it specifically , his promise referred only to people who have had uninterrupted health insurance coverage dating back to before the law ’ s enactment in 2010 .
But even Obama allies such as House Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer , Maryland Democrat , acknowledged that the president ’ s promises were overly broad . Mr. Hoyer said Mr. Obama ’ s message “ was not precise enough . ”
“ Clearly , it should have been caveated with , ‘ Assuming you have a policy that , in fact , does do what the bill is designed to do , ’ ” Mr. Hoyer said .
Republican lawmakers , and some of the nearly 7 million consumers who could receive cancellation notices , say Mr. Obama has been lying to them .
“ If the president knew that these [ cancellation ] letters were coming and still indicated that you could keep your health care plan if you liked it , now , that raises some serious questions about the sales job of Obamacare , ” said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor , Virginia Republican .
SEE ALSO : White House : ‘ You can keep your plan ’ promise was not misleading
On social media , the reaction was more harsh . In a comment that was typical of the mounting criticism , a woman on Twitter with the handle of @ KatLadyNE called the administration “ pathetic liars . ”
White House press secretary Jay Carney said Mr. Obama “ was clear about a basic fact . ”
“ If you had a plan before the Affordable Care Act that you liked on the individual market , and your insurance company provided you the same plan this whole time , you can keep it . ”
But that was not what millions of Americans heard the president pledging over the past five years . In August 2009 , for example , Mr. Obama decried what he called “ outrageous myths circulating on the Internet , on cable TV , and repeated at some town halls across this country ” about the health care legislation .
“ As I ’ ve said from the beginning , under the reform we seek , if you like your doctor , you can keep your doctor , ” Mr. Obama said . “ If you like your private health insurance plan , you can keep your plan . Period . ”
In a June 2009 speech to the American Medical Association , Mr. Obama declared emphatically : “ No matter how we reform health care , we will keep this promise to the American people : If you like your doctor , you will be able to keep your doctor , period . If you like your health care plan , you ’ ll be able to keep your health care plan , period . No one will take it away , no matter what . ”
Even as late as March , Mr. Obama spoke in the present tense when he told Americans , “ If you like the plan that you have , you can keep it , period . ”
Critics noted that the Affordable Care Act is forcing insurers to drop many of their plans that don ’ t meet the law ’ s 10 minimum standards , including maternity care , emergency visits and mental health treatment .
As a result , insurance companies across the country have sent cancellation notices to more than 2 million people who had purchased policies on the individual market . In New Jersey , there are 800,000 ; in Florida , 300,000 ; in California , 279,000 ; and in Michigan , 140,000 .
One industry analyst has estimated that as many as 7 million people will have their policies canceled , requiring them to shop for plans under Obamacare that are often more expensive , especially if the consumer doesn ’ t qualify for a taxpayer-funded subsidy .
An insurance industry specialist , Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation , said insurance companies have no choice but to take these actions . “ It is administratively easier to cancel than change plans , ” he said on his Twitter account .
As the furor grew Tuesday over canceled policies , the White House and its Democratic allies increasingly were casting blame on the insurance industry instead of the law .
Democrats raised a trial balloon for this offensive late Monday night from two key presidential aides .
Valerie Jarrett , one of President Obama ’ s most trusted advisers , wrote on her Twitter account : “ Nothing in # Obamacare forces people out of their health plans . No change is required unless insurance companies change existing plans. ” Deputy press secretary Eric Schultz published a near-identical tweet : “ Don ’ t be fooled . Nothing in the ACA forces people out of their plans . No change is required unless ins companies change their existing plan ”
The comments prompted a furious reaction , including from one conservative blogger who likened Ms. Jarrett ’ s explanation to saying “ there ’ s nothing about land mines that forces explosions . ”
The Democratic pushback coincided with a flurry of Capitol Hill activity on the botched Obamacare rollout .
• At a House Ways and Means Committee hearing , the head of the agency overseeing the law apologized Tuesday to people who have tried to use the flawed federal website .
• The House investigative panel issued a subpoena against Quality Software Services Inc. demanding documents that will show whether the contractor hired to build the federal Obamacare website took precautions on data security .
The White House tried to emphasize Tuesday that 80 percent of Americans will keep their insurance coverage , and “ only ” 5 percent of consumers will be required to purchase policies by March 31 — about 14 million people . Mr. Carney characterized the current insurance market as “ the Wild West , ” saying it has been “ underregulated . ”
As a result , he said , unscrupulous insurance companies have been free to leave consumers unprotected in a health care crisis .
“ They could throw you off . They could jack up your premiums . They could change your coverage , ” Mr. Carney said , ironically citing the same complaints of people whose policies are being canceled as a result of Obamacare .
When a reporter confronted Mr. Carney with the fact that many consumers are being forced out of plans they like , the president ’ s spokesman replied , “ If you want to make that point , you can . ”","As millions of people receive notices that their health insurance is being canceled, the White House said Tuesday that President Obama didn’t mislead the public when he repeatedly and emphatically promised that everyone could keep their plan under Obamacare.

In August 2009, for example, Mr. Obama decried what he called “outrageous myths circulating on the Internet, on cable TV, and repeated at some town halls across this country” about the health care legislation.

“As I’ve said from the beginning, under the reform we seek, if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor,” Mr. Obama said. “If you like your private health insurance plan, you can keep your plan. Period.”

In a June 2009 speech to the American Medical Association, Mr. Obama declared emphatically: “No matter how we reform health care, we will keep this promise to the American people: If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor, period. If you like your health care plan, you’ll be able to keep your health care plan, period. No one will take it away, no matter what.”

Even as late as March, Mr. Obama spoke in the present tense when he told Americans, “If you like the plan that you have, you can keep it, period.”

Critics noted that the Affordable Care Act is forcing insurers to drop many of their plans that don’t meet the law’s 10 minimum standards, including maternity care, emergency visits and mental health treatment.

As a result, insurance companies across the country have sent cancellation notices to more than 2 million people who had purchased policies on the individual market. In New Jersey, there are 800,000; in Florida, 300,000; in California, 279,000; and in Michigan, 140,000.

One industry analyst has estimated that as many as 7 million people will have their policies canceled, requiring them to shop for plans under Obamacare that are often more expensive, especially if the consumer doesn’t qualify for a taxpayer-funded subsidy.

An insurance industry specialist, Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation, said insurance companies have no choice but to take these actions. “It is administratively easier to cancel than change plans,” he said on his Twitter account.

As the furor grew Tuesday over canceled policies, the White House and its Democratic allies increasingly were casting blame on the insurance industry instead of the law.

Democrats raised a trial balloon for this offensive late Monday night from two key presidential aides.

Valerie Jarrett, one of President Obama’s most trusted advisers, wrote on her Twitter account: “Nothing in #Obamacare forces people out of their health plans. No change is required unless insurance companies change existing plans.” Deputy press secretary Eric Schultz published a near-identical tweet: “Don’t be fooled. Nothing in the ACA forces people out of their plans. No change is required unless ins companies change their existing plan”

The comments prompted a furious reaction, including from one conservative blogger who likened Ms. Jarrett’s explanation to saying “there’s nothing about land mines that forces explosions.”

The Democratic pushback coincided with a flurry of Capitol Hill activity on the botched Obamacare rollout.

• At a House Ways and Means Committee hearing, the head of the agency overseeing the law apologized Tuesday to people who have tried to use the flawed federal website.

• The House investigative panel issued a subpoena against Quality Software Services Inc. demanding documents that will show whether the contractor hired to build the federal Obamacare website took precautions on data security.

The White House tried to emphasize Tuesday that 80 percent of Americans will keep their insurance coverage, and “only” 5 percent of consumers will be required to purchase policies by March 31 — about 14 million people. Mr. Carney characterized the current insurance market as “the Wild West,” saying it has been “underregulated.”

As a result, he said, unscrupulous insurance companies have been free to leave consumers unprotected in a health care crisis.

“They could throw you off. They could jack up your premiums. They could change your coverage,” Mr. Carney said, ironically citing the same complaints of people whose policies are being canceled as a result of Obamacare.

When a reporter confronted Mr. Carney with the fact that many consumers are being forced out of plans they like, the president’s spokesman replied, “If you want to make that point, you can.”

Here 's what to watch Thursday and how they got to this point .
House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy explicitly says yes . House leaders have made crystal clear nothing would be scheduled for a floor vote until they had 216 votes . So do they have 216 votes ? Well , here 's a sampling of GOP aides after the announcement last night .
Here 's the reality : In situations like this , in votes this close , leadership relies heavily on members who make clear they 'd really rather not vote for this bill , but they 'll be there if leaders need them . By all accounts , on Thursday , leaders are going to need them .
So while Republicans are n't going into this vote with 216 firm , happy , `` yes '' votes , they have a handful of members who have given commitments that they 'll be there if they need them . And that , based on the decision to green light the vote Wednesday night , makes them comfortable enough .
Why are they voting now , without an updated Congressional Budget Office score , less than 24 hours after the final amendment text was posted ?
Because they think they have the votes , and when you have the votes , you vote .
Pretty good adage to go by on Capitol Hill : plan beats no plan , votes beat no votes .
Translation : no matter how flawed , something officially on paper , in legislative text , will win the day over some amorphous perfect policy proposal . Similarly , something that can get 216 votes beats something that ca n't .
Seems obvious , but that 's really the explanation . House leaders are keenly aware that the longer this hangs out there , the less likely it is they 'll gain votes . In fact , as interest groups , town halls , the opposition gets a hold of things , it 's more likely they 'd hemorrhage them . So despite not knowing how many people this updated plan would cover , or how much it would cost ( or , in this case , cut from the deficit ) , they 're going to the floor . Votes beats no votes .
On the policy ? No . While GOP policy staff says explicitly they believe the $ 8 billion added to the bill Wednesday is enough to address any concerns raised by states opting out of Obamacare 's pre-existing conditions price protections , there are no shortage of policy analysts and Democrats who vigorously dispute that .
But on the momentum ? Without question . It 's tough to overstate what flipping , in such a public way at the White House , Reps. Billy Long and Fred Upton did for the prospects of this bill . Leadership had run into a brick wall . They were n't going to get the votes . They were staring 2.0 ( or 3.0 ? ) in the face . Flipping two very high profile `` no '' votes , and doing so with a proposal that ostensibly addresses the core of the concerns that have plagued the new proposal up to that point ( giving states the ability to opt out of the price protections in Obamacare ) , was a very big deal .

Here's what to watch Thursday and how they got to this point.

Do they actually have the votes?

House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy explicitly says yes. House leaders have made crystal clear nothing would be scheduled for a floor vote until they had 216 votes. So do they have 216 votes? Well, here's a sampling of GOP aides after the announcement last night.

""Close enough to go.""

""Buckle up.""

""Still have some work to do, but we're there.""

Here's the reality: In situations like this, in votes this close, leadership relies heavily on members who make clear they'd really rather not vote for this bill, but they'll be there if leaders need them. By all accounts, on Thursday, leaders are going to need them.

So while Republicans aren't going into this vote with 216 firm, happy, ""yes"" votes, they have a handful of members who have given commitments that they'll be there if they need them. And that, based on the decision to green light the vote Wednesday night, makes them comfortable enough.

Was an $8 billion cash infusion the silver bullet?
