This new investigative track is in addition to the focus on classified material found on Clinton ’ s personal server .
`` The agents are investigating the possible intersection of Clinton Foundation donations , the dispensation of State Department contracts and whether regular processes were followed , '' one source said .
Clinton , speaking to the Des Moines Register , on Monday pushed back on the details of a second investigative track . According to reporter Jennifer Jacobs , Clinton said Monday she has heard nothing from the FBI .
`` No , there ’ s nothing like that that is happening , '' Clinton said , according to a tweet from Jacobs .
Experts including a former senior FBI agent said the bureau does not have to notify the subject of an investigation .
The development follows press reports over the past year about the potential overlap of State Department and Clinton Foundation work , and questions over whether donors benefited from their contacts inside the administration .
The Clinton Foundation is a public charity , known as a 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) . It had grants and contributions in excess of $ 144 million in 2013 , the most current available data .
Inside the FBI , pressure is growing to pursue the case .
One intelligence source told Fox News that FBI agents would be “ screaming ” if a prosecution is not pursued because “ many previous public corruption cases have been made and successfully prosecuted with much less evidence than what is emerging in this investigation . ”
The FBI is particularly on edge in the wake of how the case of former CIA Director David Petraeus was handled .
One of the three sources said some FBI agents felt Petraeus was given a slap on the wrist for sharing highly classified information with his mistress and biographer Paula Broadwell , as well as lying to FBI agents about his actions . Petraeus pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor in March 2015 after a two-plus-year federal investigation in which Attorney General Eric Holder initially declined to prosecute .
In the Petraeus case , the exposure of classified information was assessed to be limited .
By contrast , in the Clinton case , the number of classified emails has risen to at least 1,340 . A 2015 appeal by the State Department to challenge the “ Top Secret ” classification of at least two emails failed and , as Fox News first reported , is now considered a settled matter .
It is unclear which of the two lines of inquiry was opened first by the FBI and whether they eventually will be combined and presented before a special grand jury . One intelligence source said the public corruption angle dates back to at least April 2015 . On their official website , the FBI lists `` public corruption as the FBI 's top criminal priority . ''
Fox News is told that about 100 special agents assigned to the investigations also were asked to sign non-disclosure agreements , with as many as 50 additional agents on “ temporary duty assignment , ” or TDY . The request to sign a new NDA could reflect that agents are handling the highly classified material in the emails , or serve as a reminder not to leak about the case , or both .
`` The pressure on the lead agents is brutal , '' a second source said . `` Think of it like a military operation , you might need tanks called in along with infantry . ''
Separately , a former high-ranking State Department official emphasized to Fox News that Clinton ’ s deliberate non-use of her government email address may be increasingly “ significant . ”
“ It is virtually automatic when one comes on board at the State Department to be assigned an email address , ” the source said .
“ It would have taken an affirmative act not to have one assigned ... and it would also mean it was all planned out before she took office . This certainly raises questions about the so-called legal advice she claimed to have received from inside the State Department that what she was doing was proper . ''

“ There was a deliberate request [ to delete the footage ] – this wasn ’ t a technical glitch , ” State Department spokesman John Kirby said Wednesday , in admitting that an unidentified official had a video editor “ excise ” the segment .
The State Department had faced questions earlier this year over the block of missing tape from a December 2013 briefing . At that briefing , then-spokeswoman Jen Psaki was asked by Fox News ’ James Rosen about an earlier claim that no direct , secret talks were underway between the U.S. and Iran – when , in fact , they were .
Psaki at the time seemed to admit the discrepancy , saying : “ There are times where diplomacy needs privacy in order to progress . This is a good example of that . ”
However , Fox News later discovered the Psaki exchange was missing from the department ’ s official website and its YouTube channel . Eight minutes from the briefing , including the comments on the Iran deal , were edited out and replaced with a white-flash effect .
But on Wednesday , current State Department spokesman Kirby said someone had censored the video intentionally . He said he could n't find out who was responsible , but described such action as unacceptable .
While saying there were “ no rules [ or ] regulations in place that prohibited ” this at the time , Kirby said : `` Deliberately removing a portion of the video was not and is not in keeping with the State Department 's commitment to transparency and public accountability . ”
Kirby said he learned that on the same day of the 2013 briefing , a video editor received a call from a State Department public affairs official who made `` a specific request ... to excise that portion of the briefing . ''
Kirby says he has since ordered the original video restored on all platforms and asked the State Department 's legal adviser to examine the matter . He said no further investigation will be made , primarily because no rules were in place against such actions .
Kirby said he has ordered new rules created to prevent a recurrence .
Speaking Thursday with Fox News , Kirby did not rule out looking further into who might have been behind the request , but said right now : “ We just don ’ t know who made the request or why . ”
Kirby also said Psaki , in the 2013 briefing , was not trying to say anybody at the department lied about the Iran deal . “ We don ’ t lie , ” he said .
One of the toughest congressional critics of the Iran deal , Republican Sen. Tom Cotton , called Thursday for the administration to find who was responsible .
“ The Administration must start dealing in the truth . One place to start is to identify the official who ordered the manipulation of the video and impose appropriate discipline , ” he said in a statement .
In a statement issued late Wednesday aftrnoon , Psaki , now White House Communications Director , said , `` I had no knowledge of nor would I have approved of any form of editing or cutting my briefing transcript on any subject while at the State Department . ''
The Psaki footage took on new significance last month on the heels of a New York Times Magazine profile of Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes , who boasted of creating an “ echo chamber ” to sell the Iran deal .
Rhodes later claimed they did not mislead the public and “ confirmed publicly ” there were “ discreet channels of communication established with Iran in 2012 . ”

Other similar operations in the past two weeks in Iraq and Libya successfully freed hundreds of convicted or suspected Islamic terrorists , a known strategy of al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri .
Bergen and other analysts cited the prison breaks as one of several reasons the United States has dramatically heightened its security stance by issuing a worldwide travel alert and closing almost two dozen embassies and consulates on Sunday , with 19 of them remaining shut for the rest of the week .
The State Department said the substantial security steps reflect an `` abundance of caution '' over intelligence information that indicated final planning by al Qaeda in Yemen for possible terrorist attacks on Western targets to coincide with the end of Ramadan this week .

An intercepted message among senior al Qaeda operatives in the last several days further intensified concerns already heightened by increased terrorist chatter detected by intelligence agencies , as well as the prison breaks .
A message from al-Zawahiri to his second in command in Yemen told him to `` do something , '' CNN has learned . U.S. and Yemeni officials had already spent weeks watching a rising stream of intelligence about the possibility of a major terrorist attack in Yemen , so the message caused them to fear imminent terrorist action .
CNN had the information over the weekend and decided not to report the details about al-Zawahiri 's involvement based on U.S. government concerns about the sensitivity of the information . Now that it has been widely reported in other media , including the New York Times and McClatchy , CNN has now decided to report it as well .
And U.S. officials cautioned that there may be multiple sources of intelligence , including intercepts of electronic information from phone calls and web postings and the interrogation of couriers or other operatives .
Asked Monday about the prison breaks , State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf called them `` a concern for the international community '' that is `` separate and apart '' from the U.S. concern about the latest specific terrorist threat .
Bergen , however , noted that al Qaeda `` actually announced a year ago that they were going to do this campaign of releasing prisoners from prison and they conducted something like seven prison assaults -- a couple of which have been quite successful . ''
A senior official with Iraq 's interior ministry told CNN on condition of not being identified that top officials of al Qaeda in Iraq , including Adnan Ismail Najim Abdullah al-Dulaimi , escaped from Abu Graib prison during the jailbreak there last month and remains at large .
Bergen noted that a 2006 prison break in the Yemeni capital , Sanaa , led to the creation of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , one of the terrorist organization 's most virulent affiliates .
Although the prison breaks are not the main reason for the raised terror threat , said CNN Terrorism Analyst Paul Cruickshank , `` it is part of the background music . '' Prison breaks can often strengthen terrorist groups because `` some of these guys are likely to be seasoned operatives , '' he added .
To CNN National Security Contributor Frances Fragos Townsend , the timing of the prison breaks and increased intelligence chatter building up to the end of Ramadan signaled heightened al Qaeda activity that required precautionary steps in response .
She noted that in the run-up to the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , `` the government failed to connect dots . ''
`` These seem like dots that ought to be connected , '' said Townsend , a former homeland security and anti-terrorism adviser to the Bush administration . `` You can figure out later whether or not you were right . ''
Another dot she cited was that al-Zawahiri recently appointed Nasir al Wuhayshi , the Yemeni leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , to be the new general manager of the global al Qaeda network .
CNN has learned al-Zawahiri 's message for action was sent to Wuhayshi .
A high-profile attack orchestrated by Wuhayshi would cement the Yemeni 's new position in the al Qaeda hierarchy , Townsend said .
Yemen is an area of particular concern . Three sources said the United States has information that members of the Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ( AQAP ) are in the final stages of planning for an unspecified attack .
According to a U.S. official with access to the latest intelligence , Wuhayshi 's appointment as a top global al Qaeda figure would almost certainly have required back-and-forth communication between AQAP and al Qaeda central .
At the White House , spokesman Jay Carney told reporters Monday that while U.S. anti-terrorism efforts had decimated al Qaeda 's global leadership and greatly diminished its core in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region , the threat still posed `` has shifted to some of these affiliates , in particular AQAP . ''
Over the weekend , Interpol warned that al Qaeda has been tied to the prison breaks on July 23 in Iraq , on July 26 in Libya and four days later in Pakistan .
Another factor prompting the embassy and consulate closures is the end of Ramadan . Depending on when a new crescent moon is seen , the Muslim holy month could end Wednesday or Thursday .
Ramadan 's end is celebrated with the Eid al-Fitr festivities -- a three-day holiday in most Muslim countries .
The State Department , in announcing its closures , alluded to this , saying that `` a number of our embassies and consulates were going to be closed in accordance with local custom and practice for the bulk of the week for the Eid celebration at the end of Ramadan . ''
Britain also announced its embassy in Yemen will remain closed through the end of Eid `` due to continuing security concerns . ''
Townsend said there could be a strategic reason for shutting down the diplomatic offices .
`` Once you take targets away , it buys you additional time to try and disrupt , to identify the cell , the operators in country and the region , and work with your partners in the region to try and ... get them in custody or disrupt the plot , '' she said . `` So , some of this operationally is about buying time . ''
A total of 19 U.S. embassies and consulates will be closed Monday through Saturday .","Story highlights Zawahiri message No. 2: 'Do something'

'Do something'

An intercepted message among senior al Qaeda operatives in the last several days further intensified concerns already heightened by increased terrorist chatter detected by intelligence agencies, as well as the prison breaks.

A message from al-Zawahiri to his second in command in Yemen told him to ""do something,"" CNN has learned. U.S. and Yemeni officials had already spent weeks watching a rising stream of intelligence about the possibility of a major terrorist attack in Yemen, so the message caused them to fear imminent terrorist action.

CNN had the information over the weekend and decided not to report the details about al-Zawahiri's involvement based on U.S. government concerns about the sensitivity of the information. Now that it has been widely reported in other media, including the New York Times and McClatchy, CNN has now decided to report it as well.

And U.S. officials cautioned that there may be multiple sources of intelligence, including intercepts of electronic information from phone calls and web postings and the interrogation of couriers or other operatives.

Asked Monday about the prison breaks, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf called them ""a concern for the international community"" that is ""separate and apart"" from the U.S. concern about the latest specific terrorist threat.

Bergen, however, noted that al Qaeda ""actually announced a year ago that they were going to do this campaign of releasing prisoners from prison and they conducted something like seven prison assaults -- a couple of which have been quite successful.""

Prison breaks

A senior official with Iraq's interior ministry told CNN on condition of not being identified that top officials of al Qaeda in Iraq, including Adnan Ismail Najim Abdullah al-Dulaimi, escaped from Abu Graib prison during the jailbreak there last month and remains at large.

Bergen noted that a 2006 prison break in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, led to the creation of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, one of the terrorist organization's most virulent affiliates.

Although the prison breaks are not the main reason for the raised terror threat, said CNN Terrorism Analyst Paul Cruickshank, ""it is part of the background music."" Prison breaks can often strengthen terrorist groups because ""some of these guys are likely to be seasoned operatives,"" he added.

To CNN National Security Contributor Frances Fragos Townsend, the timing of the prison breaks and increased intelligence chatter building up to the end of Ramadan signaled heightened al Qaeda activity that required precautionary steps in response.

She noted that in the run-up to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, ""the government failed to connect dots.""

""These seem like dots that ought to be connected,"" said Townsend, a former homeland security and anti-terrorism adviser to the Bush administration. ""You can figure out later whether or not you were right.""

Another dot she cited was that al-Zawahiri recently appointed Nasir al Wuhayshi, the Yemeni leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, to be the new general manager of the global al Qaeda network.

CNN has learned al-Zawahiri's message for action was sent to Wuhayshi.

A high-profile attack orchestrated by Wuhayshi would cement the Yemeni's new position in the al Qaeda hierarchy, Townsend said.

Yemen is an area of particular concern. Three sources said the United States has information that members of the Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) are in the final stages of planning for an unspecified attack.

According to a U.S. official with access to the latest intelligence, Wuhayshi's appointment as a top global al Qaeda figure would almost certainly have required back-and-forth communication between AQAP and al Qaeda central.

At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney told reporters Monday that while U.S. anti-terrorism efforts had decimated al Qaeda's global leadership and greatly diminished its core in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, the threat still posed ""has shifted to some of these affiliates, in particular AQAP.""

Over the weekend, Interpol warned that al Qaeda has been tied to the prison breaks on July 23 in Iraq, on July 26 in Libya and four days later in Pakistan.

End of Ramadan

Another factor prompting the embassy and consulate closures is the end of Ramadan. Depending on when a new crescent moon is seen, the Muslim holy month could end Wednesday or Thursday.

Ramadan's end is celebrated with the Eid al-Fitr festivities -- a three-day holiday in most Muslim countries.

The State Department, in announcing its closures, alluded to this, saying that ""a number of our embassies and consulates were going to be closed in accordance with local custom and practice for the bulk of the week for the Eid celebration at the end of Ramadan.""

Britain also announced its embassy in Yemen will remain closed through the end of Eid ""due to continuing security concerns.""

Strategic reason

Townsend said there could be a strategic reason for shutting down the diplomatic offices.

""Once you take targets away, it buys you additional time to try and disrupt, to identify the cell, the operators in country and the region, and work with your partners in the region to try and ... get them in custody or disrupt the plot,"" she said. ""So, some of this operationally is about buying time.""

List of closures

A total of 19 U.S. embassies and consulates will be closed Monday through Saturday.

The following 15 were part of the original list:

U.S. Embassy Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates

U.S. Embassy Amman, Jordan

U.S. Embassy Cairo, Egypt

U.S. Consulate Dhahran, Saudi Arabia

U.S. Embassy Djibouti, Djibouti

U.S. Embassy Doha, Qatar

U.S. Consulate Dubai, United Arab Emirates

U.S. Consulate Jeddah, Saudi Arabia

U.S. Embassy Khartoum, Sudan

U.S. Embassy Kuwait City, Kuwait

U.S. Embassy Manama, Bahrain

U.S. Embassy Muscat, Oman

U.S. Embassy Riyadh, Saudi Arabia

U.S. Embassy Sanaa, Yemen

U.S. Embassy Tripoli, Libya

The following four embassies have been added:

Meanwhile , Jared Kushner , Trump 's son-in-law and a top adviser , is emerging as a shadow secretary of state -- a key interlocutor with world leaders and ambassadors and the keeper of prized diplomatic files like the Middle East peace process . Steve Bannon , Trump 's chief political strategist , has also taken on an outsized role in formulating foreign policy .
Tillerson is still lacking much of his senior staff and , according to two sources familiar with the discussions , is in a struggle with the White House over choosing appointments after President Donald Trump vetoed his choice for deputy secretary . Questions about Tillerson 's influence have spilled out into the open . Media reports that he has been marginalized abound , including a blistering New York Times editorial titled `` Calling Secretary Tillerson . '' And the perception among the State Department rank-and-file is chilling .
The Washington foreign policy establishment -- both Republican and Democratic -- cautiously welcomed news of Tillerson 's appointment . While he had no diplomatic experience , many were hopeful that the former CEO of Exxon Mobil , one of the world 's largest corporations , would provide strong , pragmatic counsel to a brash and unpredictable president .
America 's top diplomat is indeed building a reputation on the world stage as a calm , steady presence in the perceived sea of chaos that has enveloped the White House . Conversations with aides to Tillerson , career foreign and civil service officers , lawmakers and current and former administration officials paint a picture a goal-oriented career executive bringing a CEO mentality to reforming the State Department , and perhaps the job of secretary of state .
But back home at Foggy Bottom there is also anxiety that the former executive is struggling with the parry and thrust of Washington politics -- particularly given that he is up against a highly politicized presidential inner circle looking to exert its own influence over foreign policy .
Tillerson arrived at Foggy Bottom to great enthusiasm . His introductory remarks to employees struck a moderate , respectful and assuring tone to demoralized career officers worried about the direction of foreign policy under Trump .
Since then , more than two dozen senior staff in the Secretary 's suite of offices were abruptly reassigned while Tillerson was in Europe .
Tillerson has reduced the number of `` all-hands '' meetings , preferring smaller meetings and short two-page briefing memos instead of the traditional process of consensus-building hashed out during in-person sessions . Tillerson 's chief of staff , Margaret Peterlin , has also kept a tight rein on all communications with the secretary .
`` He is all about hierarchy , chain of command and structure , '' a longtime foreign service officer said . `` It 's not a happy building . ''

That unhappiness has been magnified in recent days in light of reports the White House aims to drastically cut the agency 's budget by as much as 30 % .
That Tillerson would look to make reforms to the agency was no surprise . On Day One he pledged to `` do my part to make sure we are functioning in the most productive and efficient way possible . ''
`` Change for the sake of change can be counterproductive , and that will never be my approach , '' he said . `` But we can not sustain ineffective traditions over optimal outcomes . ''
Aides and defenders see Tillerson 's CEO mentality as a benefit and key to what they believe will be a successful run at the helm of the State Department .
`` Everything he does has to have a purpose , '' RC Hammond , a senior adviser to Tillerson , told CNN . `` He is not motivated by the politics of perception . ''
Aides to Tillerson describe their boss as in the `` first phase '' of a strategic approach toward reforming the State Department to meet what he feels are the needs of modern diplomacy over the next 20 years . His seventh-floor suite of offices is populated with white boards littered with diagrams and organizational charges .
`` This phase involves focusing on relationships and probing to find out where the problems are and what needs to be fixed , '' Hammond said . `` The next phase is going to create an opportunity for everybody to be a part of the solution -- and the status quo is not necessarily the solution . ''
That includes a concerted effort among Tillerson 's top aides to stem leaks within the building . Tillerson has let it be known that he wants to establish an environment where employees feel empowered to debate policy within the department without the discussions becoming public .
`` He is an engineer and is going to have a very methodical way of learning the facts and following where the facts lead , '' said former George W. Bush national security adviser Steven Hadley , who recommended Tillerson to Trump . `` He is going to be cautious and work his way into the job , which is not what some people want to see him doing . But what he is doing is probably the right thing for him . ''
But even those rooting for Tillerson 's success worry his business-minded approach of delegating important work leaves him ill-equipped to combat the power struggles common to Washington .
Traditionally , the secretary of state attends all meetings between the President and world leaders . The former businessman , however , has skipped most of Trump 's meetings with world leaders and several career diplomats voiced concern after he was left out of early key policy discussions , such as on the President 's statements that he 'd be open to a one-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and that he was putting Iran `` on notice '' for its most recent ballistic missile test .
Tillerson sent his acting deputy , Tom Shannon , to Trump 's meetings with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau .
And the secretary was on his way to the G-20 meeting during the President 's meeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , although he did have dinner with Netanyahu the night before .
After a quick trip at the G-20 ministers ' meeting in Bonn , Germany , Tillerson returned to Washington while Vice President Mike Pence , Defense Secretary James Mattis and Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly continued consultations with key figures abroad .
In a political town where clout is judged by your closeness to the President , the optics of missing those meetings can have consequences .

Several supporters said it shows Tillerson is not seeking the limelight and has confidence in where he sits within the administration .
`` His general take is , if the President is meeting with someone , he has it covered . So why does he have to be there ? '' one of his aides said . `` This is a man very comfortable in his own skin , knows what his role is and is very focused on the goals in front of him . ''
With daily calls and twice-weekly meetings with Trump , Tillerson has no shortage of access to the Oval Office . His most recent opportunity for quality facetime came Wednesday night when he dined with the President .
One aide said Tillerson 's take on his new job can be chalked up to the motto of the Texas rangers of his home state : `` one riot , one ranger . '' It 's a phrase that captures his belief that if other members of the team are dealing with a foreign policy issue , he does n't need to be in the room .
A longtime diplomat offered a less flattering view of Tillerson 's tendency to stand back and delegate : `` He does n't understand that he is not he is not the CEO . He is now staffing the President . He is not the top dog anymore . ''
Several of the near two-dozen foreign ministers who have met Tillerson since he took office describe the former oil titan as a serious , thoughtful , independent-minded interlocutor on top of his brief and eager to engage on issues ranging from Syria to North Korea , even as he remains honest about the fact that the Trump administration 's policies across the board are still being formed .
With virtually no senior staff , though , Tillerson is ill-equipped to provide comprehensive policy guidance to the White House , where decisions are being made at warp speed , typically without interagency debate .
And foreign policy insiders cautioned the approach is denying Tillerson an opportunity to both see how world leaders operate and study his new boss to influence his thinking .
`` If you are n't in the room , I think you are missing a lot of data that would make it helpful to do your job , '' said Wendy Sherman , who led negotiations for the Iran nuclear talks under President Barack Obama .
While Tillerson has praised the work of career employees serving in temporary capacities , the lack of appointed aides has left diplomats gravitating toward the White House -- and Trump aides like Kushner and Bannon -- for information about policy deliberations .
One Tillerson ally described the secretary as frustrated with Kushner and Bannon 's diplomatic interference , such as their side dialogues with Mexican officials in advance of his visit to Mexico City . Officials said Tillerson also intervened to delay a White House meeting with top Saudi officials over a plan to combat ISIS because he felt there was not enough planning for it .
Other allies and aides deny any tension between the two men and say Kushner has been very helpful , both in getting the secretary 's input and focusing the President 's attention on issues important to Tillerson .
Aides say Tillerson 's subtle hand is already being felt on key foreign policy issues . He successfully lobbied behind the scenes to persuade Trump to recommit to the `` one China '' policy and has been quietly pushing China to put more pressure on North Korea . Immediately after a meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi , China cut all coal imports to North Korea .
Tillerson supporters predict once Tillerson has a staff in place the pendulum will swing and his influence in the administration will be felt more concretely .
Elliott Abrams , whom Tillerson selected as his No . 2 but was vetoed by the President because of his criticism of Trump during the campaign , attributed Tillerson 's relctance to fully engage to the `` growing pains '' of fitting into a new role , particularly in a non-traditional White House .
Abrams is among other Tillerson supporters who said it is too early to make a judgement on the secretary 's ability to influence policy and predict once he gets a staff in place , things will change .
Part of the problem could be Tillerson 's self-imposed low profile . Aside from a brief statement to the G-20 ministers and another last week in Mexico , Tillerson has said little more than 100 words in public .
He has not taken questions from the press or appointed a spokesman , and has taken only small press pools on his first trip few trips instead of the customary group of diplomatic reporters . The daily State Department press briefing , a tradition dating back to the Eisenhower administration , has yet to resume , although it is expected to start again next week .
Tillerson 's supporters feel he has been smart to lay low while he learns the job and builds a relationship with the President . They also note his approach has kept the State Department from becoming embroiled in the controversies and mixed messages coming out of the White House .

But they acknowledge his own influence , and that of the State Department , will depend in part on his strength as a public figure and his ability to win the support of Congress , interest groups and the American public .
`` Certainly what he is used to is sitting down with presidents and kings and sheiks and doing business . The public part of this he is less familiar with , '' Abrams said . `` Clearly being a public figure matters ; it is part of being secretary of state . But he 's got to figure out what combination of public and private pressure works best with the President . ''
Wendy Sherman , who served as a top adviser to the last four Democratic secretaries of state , said that while it 's common for new secretaries to put their own stamp on Foggy Bottom , `` it 's not enough to just make changes . ''
She continued , `` People are hungry for more . He needs to share what his vision is . How he is going about his work . How he plans to do this job . How he plans to relate to the press . People are picking up signals and it is making a lot of people very anxious . ''
If Tillerson is feeling the heat , though , he does n't seem to be showing it . Instead , aides and supporters say he is hunkering down with precision focus on distilling complex foreign policy issues , establishing relationships with allies and assessing the massive bureaucracy he inherited .
`` I found him really impressive , '' one foreign minister said after meeting with Tillerson last month in Washington . `` Often ministers rattle off talking points at one another , but he was engaging me on what I was saying . I have to say it was a fresh perspective . ''
One ally of Tillerson outside of goverment called his friend a `` pro and a soldier '' who is `` not threatened by anything '' and predicted he would find his way .
`` He understands how to play the long game , '' the ally said .","Nearly a month into his tenure as secretary of state, Rex Tillerson is winning over foreign governments but alienating many employees at the agency he leads and raising questions about his ability to wield power in Washington.

But, as the U.S. approaches 10 years since the start of the Iraq war, Kerry also said Bush ""deserves credit for what the troops did when they went in.""

He said the troops ""did an absolutely stunning job, an extraordinary job.""

Mrs. Clinton ’ s admirers say the Saudi event shines as an example of her breaking ground by connecting directly and personally with foreign nationals .
Indeed , Mrs. Clinton has visited more nations — 112 , according to the official count — and spoken to more foreign populations than any U.S. secretary of state in history .
Impressive as that may be , her critics say Mrs. Clinton has fallen far short of making much of an impact on several foreign policy challenges facing the United States , not to mention the fate of democracy around the world .
“ I don ’ t think she ’ s been a very successful secretary of state by any measure , ” said John R. Bolton , former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations . “ I don ’ t know how her speeches have advanced American strategic interests in any way beyond maybe advancing her political career . ”
Like many other Republicans , Mr. Bolton says U.S. strategic interests have undergone a significant regression during Mrs. Clinton ’ s tenure .
This is perhaps nowhere more evident , her detractors say , than in the Middle East .
With Mrs. Clinton at Foggy Bottom , the Obama administration waffled on whether to support pro-democracy activists seeking to overthrow Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak in early 2011 . Many conservatives say the cost of that delay is one reason for Washington ’ s chilly relationship with Egypt ’ s new rulers , the Muslim Brotherhood .
If nothing else , the U.S. appears to have missed an opportunity to exert influence when it was still possible during the months surrounding Mubarak ’ s ouster .
The Obama administration — Mrs. Clinton included — took a similar posture toward pro-democracy activists in Iran during the so-called Green Revolution in 2009 , and later in Syria , which has since deteriorated into a bloody civil war .
The State Department has sent more than $ 200 million in communications equipment to Syrian rebels and humanitarian aid to Syrian civilians . But that has not stopped Syrian civilians from complaining for months that the United States has been waffling on the war ’ s periphery and resisting a leadership role .
Early on , Mrs. Clinton reasoned against intervening on grounds that Syrian President Bashar Assad had potential as a “ reformer ” — a message that outraged those fighting for his ouster .
Many now agree that America ’ s ambivalence will end with an unfortunate result : Whoever ultimately takes power in Damascus will remember Washington ’ s hands-off posture .
A truly balanced look at Mrs. Clinton ’ s legacy , her critics say , also would have to take into account the killings of a U.S. ambassador and three other Americans in a terrorist attack in Libya this year . After a perfect storm of intelligence and diplomatic security failures , J. Christopher Stevens was the first ambassador killed on the job in more than 30 years .
Close observers caution against blaming Mrs. Clinton for creating the underpinnings of the Obama administration ’ s foreign policy of “ leading from behind . ”
Even Mr. Bolton , in an interview with The ███ , argued that Mrs. Clinton has been “ dwarfed ultimately in foreign policy by the president , ” whose administration is perceived to be “ comfortable with American decline . ”
“ One of her problems , ” Mr. Bolton said , “ is that she never had the opportunity to carve out a role for herself . ”
Kurt Volker , a former CIA analyst and career State Department officer , said : “ I think she found herself in a difficult position with the White House that was really trying to minimize its engagement abroad .
“ If that ’ s the White House you ’ re working for , it ’ s very difficult to be proactive as a secretary of state , ” said Mr. Volker , noting that Mrs. Clinton “ also had to be very sensitive to the fact that she had opposed Obama in the 2008 Democratic primaries . ”
“ There was always the appearance of political division between the two of them , ” he said . “ So she had the primary responsibility of being extra careful to avoid any such appearances . ”
Some contend that Mrs. Clinton , who will be 69 in 2016 , has spent the past four years playing it safe in the interest of preserving her chances for another run for the presidency .
“ You feel to a certain degree as if she ’ s covering her tracks , ” said Joshua Landis , director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma .
Mr. Landis said Mrs. Clinton has “ taken no risks ” when it comes to U.S. relations with Saudi Arabia or other Persian Gulf monarchies that “ propagate Wahabi Islam , ” a fundamentalist movement that adheres strictly to the Koran and considers nonbelievers to be infidels . Nor , he said , has she been willing to stand up to Israel , which he described as pursuing “ colonialist policies ” in the West Bank that “ infuriate Muslims . ”
“ If she is preparing to run four years from now , it makes a lot of sense , ” Mr. Landis said .
Eliot Cohen , a top foreign policy adviser to Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney , said Mrs. Clinton ’ s mark on foreign policy is less distinct than it might have been .
“ She is not to Barack Obama as Condi Rice was to George W. Bush or Madeleine Albright was to Bill Clinton , or George Shultz was to Ronald Reagan , ” said Mr. Cohen , who worked as a special adviser to Ms. Rice for two years .
“ That is not to say Mrs. Clinton has been a bad secretary of state , ” he said , “ but rather that she has not gotten a whole lot of free reign from the White House . ”
“ You can not really see her imprint on foreign policy , ” said Mr. Cohen , who compares her to Mrs. Albright , who engineered the Clinton administration ’ s policy toward the Balkans ; Mr. Shultz , who reshaped how the Reagan administration thought about the use of force in the world ; and Ms. Rice , who fashioned a new era of U.S. relations with Europe .
Others point to the former Soviet Union and Asia as two regions where Mrs. Clinton has attempted to push boundaries set by the White House , particularly with regard to the administration ’ s self-described “ reset ” of relations with Russia .
Although many say the “ reset ” has been a fiasco — boosting authoritarian President Vladimir Putin ’ s image while leaving Russia ’ s neighbors defenseless to Moscow ’ s sphere of influence — Mr. Volker , who also served as deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs , said Mrs. Clinton has worked hard at alleviating such perceptions .
The former Soviet republic of Georgia felt particularly “ left out by the ‘ reset ’ policy on grounds that it put an emphasis on U.S. relations with Russia rather than with the most democratic former Soviet states , ” Mr. Volker said .
Recognizing this , Mrs. Clinton visited the Georgian capital of Tbilisi in 2010 and “ used the right words , saying Russia was ‘ occupying ’ part of Georgian territory and that Russia had ‘ invaded ’ Georgia , ” he said .
“ Her effort strayed from the silence that was coming from the White House , ” Mr. Volker said . “ She stepped out and said the right things .
“ She wasn ’ t playing lead on this , or a proactive U.S. policy role , but on the margins she was maneuvering for good . ”
He noted another example in which Mrs. Clinton gently resisted a White House-driven “ groundswell ” of support within NATO for reducing U.S.-controlled nuclear weapons stationed in Europe .
“ Within the confines of a U.S. policy that has been really about retreating from confrontation in the world , she was able to find a few ways to show a little spine , ” said Mr. Volker , who served as the permanent U.S. representative to NATO from the final year of the George W. Bush administration into the first year of the Obama administration .
Others say Mrs. Clinton missed opportunities to ask tough questions on Russia .
“ She toned down her human rights rhetoric substantially , ” said Ariel Cohen , a senior research fellow for Russian and Eurasian Studies at the Heritage Foundation .
The “ reset ” has been followed by significant backsliding toward authoritarianism — as highlighted the return to the presidency by Mr. Putin , whose government has ordered the U.S. Agency for International Development to cease operations in Russia and forced Radio Free Europe to stop broadcasting in the nation .
“ Rhetoric from Hillary Clinton and from the State Department and most importantly from President Obama could have been more stringent , ” said Mr. Cohen , who also criticized Mrs. Clinton for “ not doing enough to promote ties between the countries of Central Asia , the South Caucasus and Ukraine , Moldova and Belarus , and to encourage them to integrate more with the West . ”
“ The result is that we ’ re losing the post-Soviet states , ” he said . “ They ’ re falling back into Moscow ’ s orbit . ”
The extent to which blame should be laid on Mrs. Clinton remains a topic of debate . Regardless of political leanings , many say waning U.S. influence in the former Soviet bloc is partly a consequence of the Obama administration ’ s other major foreign policy initiative : the self-described “ pivot to Asia . ”
China ’ s smaller neighbors have grown alarmed as the Middle Kingdom increasingly flexes its military muscles in territorial disputes along the oil- and gas-rich Pacific Rim .
The administration ’ s “ pivot ” has sought to counter China by growing new and deeper diplomatic ties in Southeast Asia , while quietly strengthening military-to-military relations with U.S. allies in the region .
The lifting of U.S. economic sanctions in exchange for pro-democracy political reforms in Myanmar is an oft-cited highlight of the “ pivot , ” and Mrs. Clinton ’ s role in the effort has won praise from liberal and conservative analysts alike .
“ Where she has had some freedom to maneuver , it ’ s been in Asia and that ’ s where the administration has done best , ” said Eliot Cohen , foreign policy adviser to vanquished Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney .
Douglas Bandow , who served as a special assistant to President Reagan , said Mrs. Clinton has “ been very active in going over and meeting with leaders in the region . ”
“ It ’ s fair to put this as part of her legacy , ” he said , cautioning against judging Mrs. Clinton ’ s overall performance without considering the historical context surrounding her reign as secretary of state .
“ What we ’ re entering into is a world where America doesn ’ t run everything . The U.S. can not dictate , ” said Mr. Bandow , who is now a senior fellow specializing in foreign policy at the Cato Institute .
Mrs. Clinton ’ s admirers say she has sought tirelessly to redefine U.S. foreign policy away from government-to-government “ talks ” and toward direct interaction with foreign citizenry .
This often has involved harnessing such issues as women ’ s rights . She has made an effort to speak before women ’ s groups in dozens of nations — and at last year ’ s Women in the World Summit in New York , she asserted that she had “ made women a cornerstone of American foreign policy . ”
Former State Department officials who worked closely with Mrs. Clinton say her finest moments were built on the cornerstone . The women who cheered for her in Saudi Arabia “ recognized what she means as a role model for women in the world , ” said Mr. Crowley , adding that Mrs. Clinton ’ s efforts have not been limited to women ’ s issues .
Mr. Crowley recalled a 2009 trip to Pakistan during which Mrs. Clinton took part in a roundtable discussion with news anchors from Pakistani television . “ In the aftermath , the reaction had one person being quoted in the major daily papers in Pakistan as saying ‘ our leaders don ’ t talk to us the way that she just talked to us , ’ ” he said .
“ She was setting a standard in terms of how leaders should engage citizens of the world , ” Mr. Crowley said , adding that Mrs. Clinton was alternatively tough in meetings with the Pakistani media before the May 2011 Navy SEAL raid that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan .
During one exchange , a group of Pakistani newspaper editors was hounding her about restrictions on U.S. aid to Pakistan , Mr. Crowley said . “ She responded by saying , ‘ Hey , you ’ ve got questions for us , well , we ’ ve got questions for you . It ’ s hard for us to believe that no one in Pakistan knows where Osama bin Laden is . ’ ”
Others say Mrs. Clinton ’ s legacy will be one of a secretary of state who honestly cared little about what her legacy would be .
Michael O ’ Hanlon , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution , said she is a leader who “ works her tail off ” and puts the pursuit of positive results well above that of praise , approval or fame .
“ She has been solid , pragmatic and diligent as opposed to flashy , risk-taking or otherwise preoccupied by her image of herself and her place in history , ” Mr. O ’ Hanlon said . “ I don ’ t think she spent a lot of time on that .

Directly to the people

`` Naming these crimes is important , '' says Kerry , `` but what is essential is to stop them . '' He ignores reporters questions at end of statement . — Mark Knoller ( @ markknoller ) March 17 , 2016
Kerry says full facts about Daesh/ISIS must go to competent courts or tribunals . Says US will work to provide evidence of the atrocities . — Mark Knoller ( @ markknoller ) March 17 , 2016
Kerry says his finding of genocide is meant to show the US recognizes `` the despicable nature of crimes '' committed by Daesh/ISIS . — Mark Knoller ( @ markknoller ) March 17 , 2016
A 1948 treaty , signed by the US and 147 other nations , declares genocide a crime under international law and states that countries need to work together `` to liberate mankind from this odious scourge . ''
In any case , there are still issues that the US has to work through , considering that a genocide designation could `` require an adjustment to US military strategy , '' according to Yahoo .
Yahoo News reported last year that the US `` has historically been reluctant to invoke the genocide treaty because of concerns it might create a moral , if not a legal , obligation to act in ways that previous administrations were not prepared to do . ''
Secretary of State John Kerry has determined ISIS is committing genocide against Christians in Iraq and Syria and will make an official announcement and declaration of genocide later today . Typically a genocide declaration requires further action to stop it , but unfortunately it looks as though Kerry will not commit additional resources to do so . An official genocide declaration requires countries to work together `` to liberate mankind from this odious scourge '' Details from the Associated Press :
Secretary of State John Kerry has determined that the Islamic State group is committing genocide against Christians and other minorities in Iraq and Syria , according to U.S. officials , as he acted to meet a congressional deadline .

More on the requirements after officially declaring genocide:

A 1948 treaty, signed by the US and 147 other nations, declares genocide a crime under international law and states that countries need to work together ""to liberate mankind from this odious scourge.""



In any case, there are still issues that the US has to work through, considering that a genocide designation could ""require an adjustment to US military strategy,"" according to Yahoo.



Yahoo News reported last year that the US ""has historically been reluctant to invoke the genocide treaty because of concerns it might create a moral, if not a legal, obligation to act in ways that previous administrations were not prepared to do.""

*ORIGINAL POST*

Secretary of State John Kerry has determined ISIS is committing genocide against Christians in Iraq and Syria and will make an official announcement and declaration of genocide later today. Typically a genocide declaration requires further action to stop it, but unfortunately it looks as though Kerry will not commit additional resources to do so. An official genocide declaration requires countries to work together ""to liberate mankind from this odious scourge"" Details from the Associated Press:

Secretary of State John Kerry has determined that the Islamic State group is committing genocide against Christians and other minorities in Iraq and Syria, according to U.S. officials, as he acted to meet a congressional deadline.



But Kerry's finding, set to be announced Thursday, will not obligate the United States to take additional action against ISIS militants and does not prejudge any prosecution against its members, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly preview Kerry's decision.

It was reported late last week Kerry would miss the deadline for the declaration, which was slated for today. Last week the House voted unanimously 393-0 to declare the actions of ISIS against Christians a genocide. European leaders, the Pope and Hillary Clinton have also been calling for the official declaration to be made.

Kerry has been urged by a number of legal organizations representing persecuted Christians in the Middle East to declare the genocide and have offered the State Department the legal evidence for doing so.

""As many governments, legislative bodies, non-governmental organizations, and world leaders have already concluded, the available evidence demonstrates that ISIS’s actions rise to the level of genocide. Furthermore, we understand that recent information received from on-the-ground interviews in the region and other sources establishes without question that ISIS is committing genocide and makes clear that claims that it is offering jizya or dhimmi status are a publicity stunt or extortion payments that pervert these classical terms,” a letter sent to Kerry last week by Andrews Kurths LPP and submitted on behalf of The Philos Project, The American Mesopotamian Organization, The Assyrian Aid Society of America and The Iraqi Christian Relief Council, states.



“The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (“Genocide Convention”) prohibits the intentional destruction, in whole or in part, of an ethnic or religious group by, inter alia, killing members of the group, causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group, or deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction,” the letter continues. “Publicly available information strongly suggests that ISIS is subjecting Assyrian and other Iraqi and Syrian Christians living in areas under the control of ISIS to genocidal conditions. ISIS purportedly offers the Assyrian Christians three options: (1) convert to Islam, (2) assume dhimmi status and pay an associated jizya tax, or (3) leave the territory. The facts suggest that, in reality, there is no choice. Those who refuse or are otherwise unable to comply are executed, and in many instances the option of paying the jizya tax is not made available. The evidence therefore suggests that the jizya tax is not a real option and may be just a pretext to justify ISIS’s atrocities. That ISIS purports to permit Assyrian Christians to pay a jizya tax to avoid conversion, execution, or displacement does not preclude a finding that ISIS’s persecution of such Christians violates the Genocide Convention.”

The Knights of Columbus also submitted a nearly 300-page report to Kerry and the State Department last week laying out a detailed case for genocide declaration.

""ISIS is committing genocide — the “crime of crimes” — against Christians and other religious groups in Syria, Iraq and Libya. It is time for the United States to join the rest of the world by naming it and by taking action against it as required by law,"" the report states. ISIS’ activities are well known. Killings, rapes, torture, kidnappings, bombings and the destruction of religious property and monuments are, in some instances, a matter of public record. The European Parliament, the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, and the Iraqi and Kurdish governments have labeled ISIS’ actions genocide. Political leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights — have done likewise.""

Ten years ago, there were nearly two million Christians living in Iraq and Syria. Today there are just 250,000.

The Weekly Standard ’ s Stephen Hayes broke the story Friday night . Hayes ’ account describes the negotiations…
A senior FBI official in the international operations division describes conversations with Kennedy about the classification of emails . In his interview , this official says his section of the FBI had attempted to contact Kennedy repeatedly over the course of several months in the spring of 2015 . Kennedy did not return the calls . In the late spring or early summer of 2015 , the FBI official reported to work surprised to find a note indicating that Kennedy had called . According to the summary , Kennedy wanted help . The FBI official spoke with Kennedy and Kennedy raised the possibility of keeping at least one Clinton email from public disclosure by obtaining a “ B9 ” exemption under the Freedom of Information Act , a rarely used exemption that refers to “ geological and geophysical information and data. ” One email in particular concerned Kennedy and , according to the FBI summary , providing a B9 exemption “ would allow him to archive the document in the basement of the department of state never to be seen again. ” The FBI official told Kennedy that he would look into the email if Kennedy would authorize a pending request for additional FBI personnel in Iraq . A summary of an interview with the section chief of the FBI records management division provides further evidence of Kennedy ’ s attempts to have the classification of some sensitive emails changed . The FBI records official , whose job includes making determinations on classification , told investigators that he was approached by his colleague in international operations after the initial discussion with Kennedy . The FBI records official says that his colleague “ pressured ” him to declassify an email “ in exchange for a quid pro quo , ” according to the interview summary . “ In exchange for making the email unclassified State would reciprocate by allowing the FBI to place more agents in countries where they are presently forbidden. ” The request was denied .
The FBI has “ explained ” these events by saying that the bargained-for exchange never took place and the FBI agent with whom Kennedy was communicating has since retired . Move along , nothing to see here . State Department spokesman Mark Toner made the absurd claim that these conversations were a “ normal part of the classification process ” — as though it ’ s “ normal ” to reclassify documents that are part of an investigation into criminal misuse of state secrets in favor of the governing party ’ s presidential nominee .
This isn ’ t acceptable , to be charitable . This communication took place amid Hillary ’ s denials that any classified material was sent or received on her email , which her former employees still working at State — including Kennedy — knew to be a lie . And rather than give the public the truth , which wouldn ’ t come out until much later , after she had won the Democrat nomination , Kennedy was working to remedy her false denials by making a lie true .
And further , he was offering essentially a bribe to the FBI in order to procure more favorable field on which the Clinton email investigation would play out .
This isn ’ t some ho-hum bureaucratic deal-making at work — or if it is , it illuminates precisely how like the Third World the corruption in Washington has become .
Consider what would happen if the middle manager or legal counsel at XYZ Corporation , whose CEO is under FBI investigation , were to offer perks and valuables to FBI agents individually or collectively as a quid pro quo for a reframing of the investigation . We all know how that would go — the charges would pile up , the offender in question would be quickly dismissed , the corporation would be dragged through the mud , and the CEO would be accused of directing the attempted bribe .
In this case there is no evidence Hillary Clinton was behind Kennedy ’ s offers — but we also don ’ t know how hard investigators have looked . After all , this horse-trading didn ’ t happen when Hillary was wrapping up her affairs at State in 2012 ; it happened last year when the FBI investigation was ramping up . One assumes Kennedy understood the stakes at hand , and one assumes he ’ s smart enough to know how best to butter his own bread as a Clintonite .
And given Kennedy ’ s role as the Clintons ’ fixer at State , you would expect that he would be the primary individual put to the squeeze in any investigation of the email scandal . Kennedy , after all , was involved in the questionable political hiring of Clinton IT tech Bryan Pagliano to a nonpolitical State Department job ; Pagliano was the man who set up Hillary ’ s private server and ended up getting immunity in the investigation .
But yes — Toner and the rest of the Democrat stooges disguised as federal bureaucrats are correct . For those of us rubes in the hinterlands this might seem a flagrant example of an out-of-control government , but for our betters inside the Beltway it ’ s a Tuesday .
And they wonder why we increasingly recoil from consent to be governed by them .","This column was intended to be a catalog of some of the latest WikiLeaks disclosures which show how thoroughly the political party currently in control of the White House (and likely to continue that control) has descended into a Third World level of corruption.

The FBI official spoke with Kennedy and Kennedy raised the possibility of keeping at least one Clinton email from public disclosure by obtaining a “B9” exemption under the Freedom of Information Act, a rarely used exemption that refers to “geological and geophysical information and data.” One email in particular concerned Kennedy and, according to the FBI summary, providing a B9 exemption “would allow him to archive the document in the basement of the department of state never to be seen again.” The FBI official told Kennedy that he would look into the email if Kennedy would authorize a pending request for additional FBI personnel in Iraq. A summary of an interview with the section chief of the FBI records management division provides further evidence of Kennedy’s attempts to have the classification of some sensitive emails changed. The FBI records official, whose job includes making determinations on classification, told investigators that he was approached by his colleague in international operations after the initial discussion with Kennedy. The FBI records official says that his colleague “pressured” him to declassify an email “in exchange for a quid pro quo,” according to the interview summary. “In exchange for making the email unclassified State would reciprocate by allowing the FBI to place more agents in countries where they are presently forbidden.” The request was denied.

The FBI has “explained” these events by saying that the bargained-for exchange never took place and the FBI agent with whom Kennedy was communicating has since retired. Move along, nothing to see here. State Department spokesman Mark Toner made the absurd claim that these conversations were a “normal part of the classification process” — as though it’s “normal” to reclassify documents that are part of an investigation into criminal misuse of state secrets in favor of the governing party’s presidential nominee.

If that’s “normal,” it’s even worse than we thought.

This isn’t acceptable, to be charitable. This communication took place amid Hillary’s denials that any classified material was sent or received on her email, which her former employees still working at State — including Kennedy — knew to be a lie. And rather than give the public the truth, which wouldn’t come out until much later, after she had won the Democrat nomination, Kennedy was working to remedy her false denials by making a lie true.

And further, he was offering essentially a bribe to the FBI in order to procure more favorable field on which the Clinton email investigation would play out.

This isn’t some ho-hum bureaucratic deal-making at work — or if it is, it illuminates precisely how like the Third World the corruption in Washington has become.

Consider what would happen if the middle manager or legal counsel at XYZ Corporation, whose CEO is under FBI investigation, were to offer perks and valuables to FBI agents individually or collectively as a quid pro quo for a reframing of the investigation. We all know how that would go — the charges would pile up, the offender in question would be quickly dismissed, the corporation would be dragged through the mud, and the CEO would be accused of directing the attempted bribe.

In this case there is no evidence Hillary Clinton was behind Kennedy’s offers — but we also don’t know how hard investigators have looked. After all, this horse-trading didn’t happen when Hillary was wrapping up her affairs at State in 2012; it happened last year when the FBI investigation was ramping up. One assumes Kennedy understood the stakes at hand, and one assumes he’s smart enough to know how best to butter his own bread as a Clintonite.

And given Kennedy’s role as the Clintons’ fixer at State, you would expect that he would be the primary individual put to the squeeze in any investigation of the email scandal. Kennedy, after all, was involved in the questionable political hiring of Clinton IT tech Bryan Pagliano to a nonpolitical State Department job; Pagliano was the man who set up Hillary’s private server and ended up getting immunity in the investigation.

But yes — Toner and the rest of the Democrat stooges disguised as federal bureaucrats are correct. For those of us rubes in the hinterlands this might seem a flagrant example of an out-of-control government, but for our betters inside the Beltway it’s a Tuesday.

And they wonder why we increasingly recoil from consent to be governed by them.",www.spectator.org,right,Uz38wPjR8vZC3pBv

EDITORIAL: Obama’s Shameful Parting Shot at Israel

In some ways, Kerry in 2013 was a perfect choice for Obama’s second secretary of state. For the better part of three decades on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Kerry had spoken as if statecraft and international diplomacy were relatively easy tasks, and only the bunch of idiots in the current administration — Republican or Democrat — could mess it up like this. Finally, Kerry would get the chance to show everybody how it’s done.

We see the results today: Syria is a charnel house. The Middle East has had plenty of bloody wars before, but only this one overwhelmed the countries of Europe with seemingly endless waves of desperate refugees. The preeminent form of Islamic fundamentalism used to be al-Qaeda, a bunch of extremists hiding in the mountains of Afghanistan. Now bloodthirsty Islamists run an actual state in the middle of the Arab world. Four years after the Benghazi attack, only one perpetrator has been brought to justice.

Russia is emboldened, taking over Crimea, biting into Ukraine, and launching not-so-subtle cyber-warfare against the United States. The Iranians, too, are emboldened, despite the much-touted agreement on their nuclear program. China and North Korea keep rattling their sabers. Venezuela is collapsing. The Taliban continues to control swaths of Afghanistan after 15 years of war.

Confronted with this litany of disaster, Kerry would probably point to four years of endless summits, meetings, joint statements, and — whether he’s honest enough to use these words or not —​ photo opportunities. Just as Hillary Clinton’s millions of miles traveled were supposed to represent some great accomplishment, Kerry will blur the distinction between activity and results.

Kerry never seemed to get tired of giving brutal regimes the benefit of the doubt and having it blow up in his face.

American foreign policy has been reduced to Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power’s asking whether Vladimir Putin’s Russia or the Ayatollah’s Iran have any shame. No, of course they don’t, and anyone who’s been paying any attention knows they don’t. The Iranians used children to clear minefields during the Iran–Iraq war. The Russians contaminated two British Airways jetliners with radioactive material in their successful plot to kill former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko. What kind of administration would rely on the Russian and Iranian regimes’ sense of shame to protect civilians in Syria?

Thus, it’s fitting that John Kerry’s last major act as secretary of state is a speech that offers up hot nonsense, a bitterly hostile address that called Israel’s government “the most right-wing in Israeli history, with an agenda driven by its most extreme elements.” (Mind you, the opposing side in this conflict elected Hamas, an actual terrorist group, to govern the Gaza Strip.)

state_department,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/2/us-faces-many-challenges-as-influence-on-world-sta/,Obama admin to hold firm in pursuit of neutrality amid global rebalancing,2014-01-02,Guy Taylor,"The U.S. pullout from Afghanistan , Syria ’ s raging civil war and missed deadlines to disarm , a potential breakthrough nuclear deal with Iran , Chinese military muscle-flexing in Asia , a rapidly evolving and amorphous al Qaeda terrorist threat , a global backlash against American spying activities — Secretary of State John F. Kerry ’ s first full year as the top U.S. diplomat promises to be busy in a foreign policy landscape increasingly resistant to American dominance .
But analysts predict that the Obama administration is likely to hold firm to its pursuit of neutrality on the world stage by seeking diplomacy over confrontation and steering away from expensive , conventional U.S. military engagement as a strategy for containing the world ’ s troublemakers .
Any number of single , unpredictable events could shake the international order in ways unseen , as was the case in mid-2013 when the horrific chemical attack blamed on the Syrian regime of President Bashar Assad suddenly killed more than 1,400 people , bringing the White House to the brink of military action before a surprising cooperative push by Moscow and Washington struck a deal to destroy Syrian chemical weapon stocks .
The biggest foreign policy challenge for the Obama administration this year will center on how to maintain deep and sustained U.S. influence in such situations , in a world where a growing number of rising powers are gaining leverage and bent on dominating the economic , political and military developments in their own regions .
“ There is a global rebalancing going on , ” said Gordon Adams , a professor of U.S. foreign policy at American University in Washington . “ It ’ s really messy and I think it ’ s going to pose the biggest challenge to American leadership not only over the next year but in the several coming years as well .
“ Not only China , but Iran , the Saudis , the Turks , the Brazilians , they ’ re all asserting themselves in their own regions and they are not listening to the U.S. , ” he said . “ It ’ s not because we don ’ t carry a big stick ; it ’ s because they ’ re doing their own rebalancing . We can ’ t tell people what to do anymore . We spent 50 years doing that because those assets , and our economy , were so powerful that we could . That ’ s all changing very quickly . ”
SEE ALSO : Bombings , killing in Lebanon become common as Syrian fighting expands
Mr. Adams said such realities were exposed last year by the global “ fracas ” surrounding revelations by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden about the agency ’ s snooping activities targeting citizens in nations considered traditional adversaries as well as those that have been allies of the United States .
“ It exposed , if you will , a kind of American assumption that we can write these rules and get what we want , ” he said . “ But now we ’ re getting blowback and it ’ s from Germany , it ’ s from Brazil and France , from people who have normally been our good friends and allies . ”
Such blowback appears to underscore just how fluid the landscape of international alliances has become as the world moves deeper into the 21st century . For the Obama administration , responding to international frustration — whether it be toward the NSA ’ s spying activities or Washington ’ s unilateral use of drones to clandestinely target and kill suspected terrorists in foreign lands — likely will remain high on the agenda .
This year , said Brian Katulis , a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress in Washington , will bring “ continued debate on the full range of issues related to intelligence reform and the impact our intelligence agencies are having overseas . ”
“ This includes the continued debate about the NSA , which had a major impact on the U.S. image in the world , as well as the ongoing debate about the use of drone strikes and the rise of the special operations command , ” Mr. Katulis said .
Mr. Katulis also pointed to China ’ s continued economic and military risings and the reactions by smaller Asian nations as issues likely to have “ broad global implications . ”
“ I suspect that the Obama administration will maintain its overall stance of pragmatically trying to deal with growing challenges [ in East Asia ] without overplaying or underplaying its hand , ” he said . “ It will continue to engage China constructively but call out its negative actions when necessary . ”
Elsewhere in the world , Washington will have to cope with the prospect of a security meltdown in Afghanistan after the withdrawal of U.S. combat forces and attempt to maintain serious influence in an unstable Middle East .
“ Topping the list in this category is the uncertainty about Iran , with Syria ’ s civil war , the transition in Egypt , and the Israeli-Palestinian talks also competing for time on the agenda , ” said Mr. Katulis . “ The administration has done a good job keeping the possibility of a deal with Iran alive and putting more time on the clock for now , but the clock is ticking . ”
The administration , he said , likely will continue to push for a historic peace agreement between Israelis and the Palestinians , particularly since Mr. Kerry seems so focused on it . “ But , ” Mr. Katulis said , “ the Syrian civil war , and the growing terrorist threat there , as well as continued turmoil in Egypt , could serve to upset the whole agenda . ”
One worrisome sign already : Ships waiting to remove Syria ’ s chemical weapons returned to port in Cyprus because Damascus missed a Dec. 31 deadline . Syria was supposed to have removed part of its chemical weapons arsenal for destruction Tuesday , but Syria ’ s prime minister blamed bureaucracy and security fears for delays in transporting the weapons to the Syrian port of Latakia .
Good news may be emerging on the global economic front , particularly since the U.S. and the European Union appear to have regained some of the footing they lost during the global recession .
In less-noticed tectonic shifts of 2013 , the U.S. overtook Saudi Arabia as the world ’ s No . 1 oil producer and Mexico paved the way for private foreign investment to begin flowing into its longtime state-controlled oil industry . These two factors likely trigger major recalculations in the global economic pecking order .
Serious U.S. influence and leadership over such trends may depend on the Obama administration ’ s ability to forge ahead with the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership . These broad-based agreements aim to expand free trade with a focus on the European Union , Latin America and nations across Asia .
But the administration ’ s global economic agenda stands a good chance of being weighed down by political infighting and gridlock in Washington — or at least “ stalled by complicated trade negotiations abroad and nonfunctional politics in the midterm year at home , ” Mr. Katulis said .
Biting domestic politics , Mr. Adams said , won ’ t help the administration cope with the growing number of nations that have “ drifted away in various ways from American leadership . ”
“ That ’ s going to be a domestic issue here at home because we ’ re in an election year and Republicans are going to do everything they can to say the Obama administration is declinist , is failing in providing leadership and is weak , ” he said .
Mr. Adams pointed to the irony that there “ is this option supported by the left of the Dems and the right of the GOP to pull back , go home and let everyone else in the world settle their own has — that we shouldn ’ t be sticking our nose into everyone else ’ s problems globally . ”
“ That ’ s the Barney Frank , Rand Paul view of the world , ” he said . “ But that ’ s not Obama . It ’ s not what ’ s he ’ s doing . ”
The president also is not embracing the “ traditional neocon and John McCain-Republican Party approach ” of a more interventionist foreign policy , added Mr. Adams . “ That ’ s not Obama , either . ”
Instead , the administration is pursuing a third approach focused on simply responding to and trying to manage the “ global rebalancing . ”
“ How do you manage the realities of a globe where the assertive use of American military power doesn ’ t always get you where you want but it doesn ’ t get you into trouble , either , ” said Mr. Adams . “ President Obama is going to get hammered politically in 2014 for failures of leadership , when in reality , I think what ’ s going on here has to do with the difficulties of trying to manage a rebalancing that would be tough for any president . ”","The U.S. pullout from Afghanistan, Syria’s raging civil war and missed deadlines to disarm, a potential breakthrough nuclear deal with Iran, Chinese military muscle-flexing in Asia, a rapidly evolving and amorphous al Qaeda terrorist threat, a global backlash against American spying activities — Secretary of State John F.

Pressed for the first time to answer sharp public questioning about her part in the episode , she grew angry and combative , more like the Hillary who screamed vulgarities and threw lamps at her husband at the White House than a smooth and accommodating secretary of state .
Occasionally raising her voice to a shout and scream , with her face contorted by something little short of rage , she could barely hold back tears only minutes later . She told the senators that it was the labyrinthine bureaucracy of the State Department — “ the fudge factory , ” as her predecessors have called it — that was at fault for the evasion , invention and confusion in the several stories put out by the Obama administration in the immediate aftermath of Benghazi .
She reminded the senators that a board of both Republicans and Democrats investigated the attack on the U.S. Consulate at Benghazi and the board “ made it very clear that the level of responsibility for the failures that they outlined were set by the assistant secretary of state and below . These requests don ’ t ordinarily come to the secretary of state . ”
This was not good enough for Sen. Rand Paul , the freshman Republican senator from Kentucky .
“ I think ultimately with your leaving [ the State Department ] you accept culpability for the worst tragedy since Sept. 11 , [ 2001 ] , ” he told her . “ If I ’ d been president at the time and I ’ d found that you did not read the cables from Benghazi , that you did not read the cables from Ambassador [ J. Christopher ] Stevens , I would have relieved you of your post . Not to know of the requests for security , really , I think cost these people their lives . ”
When Sen. Ron Johnson , Wisconsin Republican , asked why someone hadn ’ t interviewed survivors of Benghazi before Susan E. Rice , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , was sent out to deliberately offer a false account of what happened , Mrs. Clinton exploded with sarcasm .
“ With all due respect , ” she replied , in a voice that didn ’ t sound overflowing with respect , “ Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided they ’ d go kill some Americans , what difference at this point does it make ? ”
This was truly tough stuff , to be held responsible for four people losing their lives . Mrs. Clinton was unsettled for the rest of the day . She repeated several times the assertion that she accepted responsibility for the mistakes her department made on Sept. 11 , 2012 , but was told in official proceedings for the first time that the fault , as well as the responsibility , was hers .
Hillary Clinton has lived in a soap opera since she first arrived from Arkansas as the wife of a credible candidate for president of the United States .

She was the emotionally abused wife , standing at her husband ’ s side in the 1992 New Hampshire primary but not , she famously said , willing to take the advice of country-music singer Tammy Wynette to “ stand by your man. ” But when her husband introduced millions of Americans to their first public discussion of oral sex and was accused of sexual dalliance by a White House intern less than half his age , she not only stood by her man but cast herself as his avenging angel , accusing the critics of her man of working together in “ a vast right-wing conspiracy . ”
With the White House years behind her , she moved to New York and , having never lived in New York and neither knowing the way to Schenectady nor the shuffle to Buffalo , succeeded as a celebrity senator . She cast herself , with considerable help from her husband ’ s genius for politics , as the inevitable president in 2008 , only to see her candidacy evaporate in the cool shadow of Barack Obama .
She drew praise from both friend and old foe as secretary of state , performing flawlessly as the president ’ s voice abroad . Until Benghazi . Nothing about Benghazi makes anyone in the Obama government look good . The hearings Wednesday in Congress were in all likelihood Hillary ’ s last hurrah . There was little to hurrah about . It ’ s how Washington will remember her .","ANALYSIS/OPINION:

ANALYSIS/OPINION:

The “old” Hillary Rodham Clinton emerged yesterday in the congressional hearings about what happened in Benghazi, and it’s the Hillary image that’s likely to last.

Pressed for the first time to answer sharp public questioning about her part in the episode, she grew angry and combative, more like the Hillary who screamed vulgarities and threw lamps at her husband at the White House than a smooth and accommodating secretary of state.

Occasionally raising her voice to a shout and scream, with her face contorted by something little short of rage, she could barely hold back tears only minutes later. She told the senators that it was the labyrinthine bureaucracy of the State Department — “the fudge factory,” as her predecessors have called it — that was at fault for the evasion, invention and confusion in the several stories put out by the Obama administration in the immediate aftermath of Benghazi.

She reminded the senators that a board of both Republicans and Democrats investigated the attack on the U.S. Consulate at Benghazi and the board “made it very clear that the level of responsibility for the failures that they outlined were set by the assistant secretary of state and below. These requests don’t ordinarily come to the secretary of state.”

This was not good enough for Sen. Rand Paul, the freshman Republican senator from Kentucky.

“I think ultimately with your leaving [the State Department] you accept culpability for the worst tragedy since Sept. 11, [2001],” he told her. “If I’d been president at the time and I’d found that you did not read the cables from Benghazi, that you did not read the cables from Ambassador [J. Christopher] Stevens, I would have relieved you of your post. Not to know of the requests for security, really, I think cost these people their lives.”

When Sen. Ron Johnson, Wisconsin Republican, asked why someone hadn’t interviewed survivors of Benghazi before Susan E. Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, was sent out to deliberately offer a false account of what happened, Mrs. Clinton exploded with sarcasm.

“With all due respect,” she replied, in a voice that didn’t sound overflowing with respect, “Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided they’d go kill some Americans, what difference at this point does it make?”

This was truly tough stuff, to be held responsible for four people losing their lives. Mrs. Clinton was unsettled for the rest of the day. She repeated several times the assertion that she accepted responsibility for the mistakes her department made on Sept. 11, 2012, but was told in official proceedings for the first time that the fault, as well as the responsibility, was hers.

Hillary Clinton has lived in a soap opera since she first arrived from Arkansas as the wife of a credible candidate for president of the United States. Over the years, she cast several images of herself, some flattering and some not. She was the emotionally abused wife, standing at her husband’s side in the 1992 New Hampshire primary but not, she famously said, willing to take the advice of country-music singer Tammy Wynette to “stand by your man.” But when her husband introduced millions of Americans to their first public discussion of oral sex and was accused of sexual dalliance by a White House intern less than half his age, she not only stood by her man but cast herself as his avenging angel, accusing the critics of her man of working together in “a vast right-wing conspiracy.”

With the White House years behind her, she moved to New York and, having never lived in New York and neither knowing the way to Schenectady nor the shuffle to Buffalo, succeeded as a celebrity senator. She cast herself, with considerable help from her husband’s genius for politics, as the inevitable president in 2008, only to see her candidacy evaporate in the cool shadow of Barack Obama.

She drew praise from both friend and old foe as secretary of state, performing flawlessly as the president’s voice abroad. Until Benghazi. Nothing about Benghazi makes anyone in the Obama government look good. The hearings Wednesday in Congress were in all likelihood Hillary’s last hurrah. There was little to hurrah about. It’s how Washington will remember her.

US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson dismissed as ""laughable"" on Friday reports that his job security is uncertain.

But rumours that the White House is considering a plan to replace him because of tensions with President Donald Trump have swirled in Washington DC for months.

In a tweet, Mr Trump categorically denied the rumours as fake news, saying Mr Tillerson was ""not leaving"". The State Department has said it is business as usual.

Meanwhile, the drama is further disrupting the already dysfunctional way foreign policy is run in this administration.

So here are my takeaways on where things stand.

Takeaway 1: A complex relationship

It clearly has not been a happy one since the summer, starting with Mr Trump's politicised speech to the Boy Scouts of America, an organisation that Mr Tillerson used to head.

The secretary of state also distanced himself from the president's equivocal response to the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville.

Then there was that extraordinary moment in October when Mr Trump suggested an IQ-test challenge after a report that Mr Tillerson had called him a moron (which the latter denounced but did not deny, although his spokeswoman eventually did).

The two have also aired striking policy differences in public: several times Mr Trump has openly undermined Mr Tillerson's positions with his tweets.

Yet the president has quietly accepted his secretary of state's diplomatic strategy on some issues, such as dealing with North Korea tensions, co-operating with Russia for a political settlement of the Syrian civil war, and agreeing to punt the Iran nuclear deal to Congress rather than abandoning it outright.

He also gave Mr Tillerson a shout out during his recent trip to Asia, where the two men shared plenty of quality time. But they are chalk and cheese in temperament and the way they work, which matters to a president who operates on instinct and interaction.

And Mr Tillerson has not really learned to play the game of Washington politics - nor does he seem interested in doing so. Which means that if this is a game to try and force him out, it is not clear if he will follow the rules.

CIA director Mike Pompeo is being lined up to replace Mr Tillerson, according to the Beltway rumour mill.

Mr Pompeo plays it well and has cultivated a relationship with Mr Trump, making a point of delivering his intelligence briefings in person. His positions are also much more in line with Mr Trump's tough approach to national security.

Takeaway 2: A deeply dysfunctional house

I am struck by the parallel universes inhabited by the secretary and his critics at the state department. According to Mr Tillerson, it is functioning well - figures show about the same number of Foreign Service Officers now as this time last year.

It is not being hollowed out, Mr Tillerson says: such reports offend him on behalf of the hardworking career diplomats who have stepped into acting roles during an excruciatingly slow process of appointing political nominees.

As for his controversial redesign of the department, he says changes to its organisation and technology are badly needed. No one disputes that the state department needs to be dragged into the 21st Century.

And at least one anecdotal report from someone who is engaged with the ""employee-led"" process sounded upbeat about the prospects for organisational reform. But we don't hear much from these employees leading the process, we do not hear much of anything at all.

More importantly to veteran diplomats, Mr Tillerson has not spelled out what strategy and priorities lie behind his drawing board: the department will be smaller and more efficient, but what will it be for?

And even if the numbers are stable, the expertise is draining away. Dozens of senior officials have been removed from their positions or taken early retirement. Hiring and promotion freezes mean they are not currently being replaced. Communication is a serious problem: between Mr Tillerson's staff and the rest of the building, and with the press.

Those of us who travel with the secretary find him personable, straightforward, and seriously engaged with the issues. But there is no importance placed on delivering his message to the wider public.

He travels in a smaller plane, which means a scaled back staff that does not give regular updates about his movements, and turns the trips into logistical nightmares.

Morale at the state department is rock bottom.

Takeaway 3: How can he do his job?

The political intrigue that may unseat Mr Tillerson is separate from the state of the state department, but together they have undercut the effectiveness of US diplomacy.

And all this has contributed to confusion about what America stands for. ""The whole administration suffers from not having articulated a clear vision for what American foreign policy is beyond the bumper sticker slogan of America First,"" Harvard international affairs professor Stephen Walt told me. Nor have they articulated how they will achieve that with a reformed state department.

Mr Tillerson has begun to try and define policy in a more systematic way region by region. His recent speech on Europe was the least ""America First"" one I have heard from this administration - extolling historic ties and emphasising the importance of and commitment to the transatlantic alliance in the face of a resurgent Russia.

“ Important to take care of [ name redacted ] , ” Douglas Band , President Bill Clinton ’ s former right-hand man , wrote to Clinton aides Huma Abedin , Cheryl Mills , and Nora Toiv in an April 22 , 2009 , email .
“ We have all had him on our radar , ” Abedin responded . “ Personnel has been sending him options . ”
The email exchanged was uncovered by government watchdog group Judicial Watch , and was the result of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit . It ’ s the latest example of the kind of cronyism that was rife at the State Department under Hillary Clinton ’ s watch .
Band served as a top aide to former President Bill Clinton and assisted in creating the Clinton Global Initiative . He is also a founding partner of Teneo , a global consulting firm that obtained approval from the State Department for a paid consulting arrangement between Bill Clinton and Band .
Teneo is the same firm where Mrs. Clinton longtime right-hand woman Huma Abedin worked as a senior adviser . Abedin was advising Teneo while working as a senior Clinton aide at the State Department .
While she was secretary of state , Hillary Clinton also handpicked Teneo co-founder and CEO Declan Kelly as her economic envoy to Northern Ireland .
In a separate email exchange , Band emailed Abedin and Mills requesting help connecting Clinton Foundation mega-donor Gilbert Chagoury with the State Department ’ s “ substance person ” on Lebanon affairs . Abedin later promised to contact the “ substance person ” about the request .
“ This is very important , ” Band replied , noting the urgency of the request .
Chagoury , of course , is the wealthy Nigerian-Lebanese businessman and longtime friend of former President Bill Clinton , whose worldwide exploits were heavily documented in The New York Times bestselling book Clinton Cash , authored by ███ Senior Editor-at-Large Peter Schweizer .
In 2000 , Switzerland convicted Chagoury of money-laundering and “ aiding a criminal organization in connection with the billions of dollars stolen from Nigeria during the [ Sani ] Abacha years ” of military dictatorship , according to a PBS Frontline report . And despite Chagoury ’ s being put on the federal terrorist no-fly list , the Clinton Foundation accepted a $ 1 to $ 5 million donation from the nefarious figure . Chagoury ’ s company pledged $ 1 billion to the Clinton Global Initiative in 2009 , the same year the Clinton Global Initiative awarded the Chagoury Group its annual prize for “ sustainable development . ”
“ No wonder Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin hid emails from the American people , the courts and Congress , ” Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said in a statement Tuesday .
Fitton asserted that Clinton and her aides violated ethics rules and may have broken the law .
“ They show the Clinton Foundation , Clinton donors , and operatives worked with Hillary Clinton in potential violation of the law . ”","A few months after Hillary Clinton took over as U.S. secretary of state in 2009, a longtime associate with connections to the Clinton Foundation insisted that her senior aides give a job to an unidentified male associate.

“We have all had him on our radar,” Abedin responded. “Personnel has been sending him options.”

The subject line on the email read “A favor…”

The email exchanged was uncovered by government watchdog group Judicial Watch, and was the result of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit. It’s the latest example of the kind of cronyism that was rife at the State Department under Hillary Clinton’s watch.

Band served as a top aide to former President Bill Clinton and assisted in creating the Clinton Global Initiative. He is also a founding partner of Teneo, a global consulting firm that obtained approval from the State Department for a paid consulting arrangement between Bill Clinton and Band.

Teneo is the same firm where Mrs. Clinton longtime right-hand woman Huma Abedin worked as a senior adviser. Abedin was advising Teneo while working as a senior Clinton aide at the State Department.

While she was secretary of state, Hillary Clinton also handpicked Teneo co-founder and CEO Declan Kelly as her economic envoy to Northern Ireland.

In a separate email exchange, Band emailed Abedin and Mills requesting help connecting Clinton Foundation mega-donor Gilbert Chagoury with the State Department’s “substance person” on Lebanon affairs. Abedin later promised to contact the “substance person” about the request.

“This is very important,” Band replied, noting the urgency of the request.

Chagoury, of course, is the wealthy Nigerian-Lebanese businessman and longtime friend of former President Bill Clinton, whose worldwide exploits were heavily documented in The New York Times bestselling book Clinton Cash, authored by Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Peter Schweizer.

In 2000, Switzerland convicted Chagoury of money-laundering and “aiding a criminal organization in connection with the billions of dollars stolen from Nigeria during the [Sani] Abacha years” of military dictatorship, according to a PBS Frontline report. And despite Chagoury’s being put on the federal terrorist no-fly list, the Clinton Foundation accepted a $1 to $5 million donation from the nefarious figure. Chagoury’s company pledged $1 billion to the Clinton Global Initiative in 2009, the same year the Clinton Global Initiative awarded the Chagoury Group its annual prize for “sustainable development.”

“No wonder Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin hid emails from the American people, the courts and Congress,” Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said in a statement Tuesday.

Fitton asserted that Clinton and her aides violated ethics rules and may have broken the law.

“They show the Clinton Foundation, Clinton donors, and operatives worked with Hillary Clinton in potential violation of the law.”

`` My purpose here today is to assert in my judgment , ( ISIS ) is responsible for genocide against groups in areas under its control including Yazidis , Christians and Shiite Muslims , '' he said , during a news conference at the State Department .
Kerry said that in 2014 , ISIS trapped Yazidis , killed them , enslaved thousands of Yazidi women and girls , `` selling them at auction , raping them at will and destroying the communities in which they had lived for countless generations , '' executed Christians `` solely for their faith '' and also `` forced Christian women and girls into slavery . ''
`` Without our intervention , it is clear that those people would have been slaughtered , '' he said .
This is the first time that the United States has declared a genocide since Darfur in 2004 .
The House of Representatives on Monday unanimously passed a resolution labeling the ISIS atrocities against Christian groups in Syria and Iraq `` genocide , '' a term the State Department had been reluctant to use about the attacks and mass murders by the terror group .

The genocide finding does not legally obligate the U.S. to take any particular action , but it could put pressure on the Obama administration to take more aggressive military action against ISIS . It could also give weight to calls by other lawmakers and humanitarian groups pushing the Obama administration to welcome more refugees into the United States .
The move , aimed at ramping up pressure on the Obama administration , appears to have worked .
The measure was non-binding , but both Republicans and Democrats in the House joined together 393-0 to back a `` sense of Congress '' saying the crimes committed against Christians , Yazidis and other ethnic and religious minorities in the region amount to war crimes and , in some cases , genocide .
Republican Rep. Jeff Fortenberry , whose Nebraska district is home to the largest group of resettled Yazidis in the U.S. , authored the resolution with California Democratic Rep. Anna Eshoo .
During debate on Monday , Fortenberry noted it was a rare instance of an issue that has `` risen above the petty and difficult differences we often work out on the floor of the House of Representatives . ''
Under a deadline set by Congress , the State Department had until Thursday to formally to decide whether it would issue a comprehensive genocide designation .
Kerry , though , had previously alluded to the possibility that the actions of ISIS , also know as ISIL , were genocide .
`` ISIL 's campaign of terror against the innocent , including the Yazidi and Christian minorities , and its grotesque targeted acts of violence , show all the warning signs of genocide , '' Kerry said in August 2014 . `` For anyone who needed a wakeup call , this is it . ''

`` I commend Secretary Kerry and the State Department for making this important designation . The genocide against Christians , Yazidis and others is not only a grave injustice to theses ancient faith communities -- it is an assault on human dignity and an attack on civilization itself , '' he said . `` The United States has now spoken with clarity and moral authority . ''
But another congressional voice , Florida Sen. Marco Rubio , criticized the administration for not taking action sooner .
`` That it took so long for the administration to arrive at this conclusion , in the face of unspeakable human suffering , defies explanation , '' Rubio , who until Tuesday was a GOP presidential candidate , said in a statement . `` At long last the United States is no longer silent in the face of this evil , but it would be travesty if we were to mistakenly take solace in this designation , if the designation did not then yield some sort of action . ''
Mirza Dinnayi , an Iraqi Yazidi activist who has been helping evacuate former Yazidi slaves of ISIS to be rehabilitated in Germany , welcomed Kerry 's announcement .
`` I am very happy to hear that ( the U.S. ) will recognize the genocide of Yezidi and Christian minorities , '' he told CNN in an email . `` This is an important step to stop the suffering of the persecuted people under the control of the extremist islamic groups , specially ISIS . And this is also important for my community to trust the international community again , because we were left in the hands of Islamic State . ''

He called on the State Department to push the U.N. to establish an international criminal court case on genocide against the Yazidis and Christians in Iraq and Syria .
`` Furthermore , '' he said , `` it is necessary to give the minorities more support to be sure that ( these ) crimes will not happen again . ''
A variety of activist and advocacy groups praised Kerry 's move Thursday .
An international center advocating against hate , terrorism and anti-Semitism was one to join the chorus .
`` The Simon Wiesenthal Center applauds Secretary Kerry 's acknowledgement that Christians and Yazidis are targets of Genocide , '' the organization said in a statement . `` We reiterate our call that the U.S put these two groups at the front of the line for consideration for immigration to our country and to redouble our efforts to destroy ISIS . ''
In Defense of Christians , a group that has heavily lobbied for recognizing what is happening as genocide , put out a statement from its president Toufic Baaklini .
`` IDC extends our deepest gratitude to Secretary Kerry and to the Obama administration for carefully reviewing the overwhelming evidence of the genocide against Christians , Yazidis , Shia Muslims and other religious minorities and for proclaiming the irrefutable truth that the crimes they have suffered constitute genocide , '' Baaklini said .
And the Archbishop of Washington , Cardinal Donald Wuerl , put out a statement of `` appreciation . ''
`` For some time , the world has witnessed the deliberate and organized effort by ISIS to eliminate Christians from the Middle East . For the U.S. government to call this savagery by its proper name -- genocide -- is a welcome step in what must now be a more committed effort at bringing peace and security to that beleaguered land , '' Wuerl said . `` These words must now be translated into action . ''","(CNN) Secretary of State John Kerry said Thursday that the United States has determined that ISIS' action against the Yazidis and other minority groups in Iraq and Syria constitutes genocide .

""My purpose here today is to assert in my judgment, (ISIS) is responsible for genocide against groups in areas under its control including Yazidis, Christians and Shiite Muslims,"" he said, during a news conference at the State Department.

Kerry said that in 2014, ISIS trapped Yazidis, killed them, enslaved thousands of Yazidi women and girls, "" selling them at auction, raping them at will and destroying the communities in which they had lived for countless generations,"" executed Christians ""solely for their faith"" and also ""forced Christian women and girls into slavery.""

""Without our intervention, it is clear that those people would have been slaughtered,"" he said.

This is the first time that the United States has declared a genocide since Darfur in 2004.

The House of Representatives on Monday unanimously passed a resolution labeling the ISIS atrocities against Christian groups in Syria and Iraq ""genocide,"" a term the State Department had been reluctant to use about the attacks and mass murders by the terror group.

The genocide finding does not legally obligate the U.S. to take any particular action, but it could put pressure on the Obama administration to take more aggressive military action against ISIS. It could also give weight to calls by other lawmakers and humanitarian groups pushing the Obama administration to welcome more refugees into the United States.

The move, aimed at ramping up pressure on the Obama administration, appears to have worked.

The measure was non-binding, but both Republicans and Democrats in the House joined together 393-0 to back a ""sense of Congress"" saying the crimes committed against Christians, Yazidis and other ethnic and religious minorities in the region amount to war crimes and, in some cases, genocide.

Republican Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, whose Nebraska district is home to the largest group of resettled Yazidis in the U.S., authored the resolution with California Democratic Rep. Anna Eshoo.

During debate on Monday, Fortenberry noted it was a rare instance of an issue that has ""risen above the petty and difficult differences we often work out on the floor of the House of Representatives.""

Under a deadline set by Congress, the State Department had until Thursday to formally to decide whether it would issue a comprehensive genocide designation.

Kerry, though, had previously alluded to the possibility that the actions of ISIS, also know as ISIL, were genocide.

""ISIL's campaign of terror against the innocent, including the Yazidi and Christian minorities, and its grotesque targeted acts of violence, show all the warning signs of genocide,"" Kerry said in August 2014. ""For anyone who needed a wakeup call, this is it.""

JUST WATCHED Yazidi women forced into slavery Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Yazidi women forced into slavery 01:00

Fortenberry praised the State Department for its decision Thursday.

""I commend Secretary Kerry and the State Department for making this important designation. The genocide against Christians, Yazidis and others is not only a grave injustice to theses ancient faith communities -- it is an assault on human dignity and an attack on civilization itself,"" he said. ""The United States has now spoken with clarity and moral authority.""

But another congressional voice, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio , criticized the administration for not taking action sooner.

""That it took so long for the administration to arrive at this conclusion, in the face of unspeakable human suffering, defies explanation,"" Rubio, who until Tuesday was a GOP presidential candidate, said in a statement. ""At long last the United States is no longer silent in the face of this evil, but it would be travesty if we were to mistakenly take solace in this designation, if the designation did not then yield some sort of action.""

Mirza Dinnayi, an Iraqi Yazidi activist who has been helping evacuate former Yazidi slaves of ISIS to be rehabilitated in Germany, welcomed Kerry's announcement.

""I am very happy to hear that (the U.S.) will recognize the genocide of Yezidi and Christian minorities,"" he told CNN in an email. ""This is an important step to stop the suffering of the persecuted people under the control of the extremist islamic groups, specially ISIS. And this is also important for my community to trust the international community again, because we were left in the hands of Islamic State.""

He called on the State Department to push the U.N. to establish an international criminal court case on genocide against the Yazidis and Christians in Iraq and Syria.

""Furthermore,"" he said, ""it is necessary to give the minorities more support to be sure that (these) crimes will not happen again.""

A variety of activist and advocacy groups praised Kerry's move Thursday.

An international center advocating against hate, terrorism and anti-Semitism was one to join the chorus.

""The Simon Wiesenthal Center applauds Secretary Kerry's acknowledgement that Christians and Yazidis are targets of Genocide,"" the organization said in a statement. ""We reiterate our call that the U.S put these two groups at the front of the line for consideration for immigration to our country and to redouble our efforts to destroy ISIS.""

In Defense of Christians, a group that has heavily lobbied for recognizing what is happening as genocide, put out a statement from its president Toufic Baaklini.

""IDC extends our deepest gratitude to Secretary Kerry and to the Obama administration for carefully reviewing the overwhelming evidence of the genocide against Christians, Yazidis, Shia Muslims and other religious minorities and for proclaiming the irrefutable truth that the crimes they have suffered constitute genocide,"" Baaklini said.

And the Archbishop of Washington, Cardinal Donald Wuerl, put out a statement of ""appreciation.""

""For some time, the world has witnessed the deliberate and organized effort by ISIS to eliminate Christians from the Middle East. For the U.S. government to call this savagery by its proper name -- genocide -- is a welcome step in what must now be a more committed effort at bringing peace and security to that beleaguered land,"" Wuerl said. ""These words must now be translated into action.""",www.cnn.com,left,w99V8GWTl6xwARxO

All but one of the U.S. diplomatic posts closed this week in a sweeping response to fears of a possible al Qaeda attack will reopen on Sunday , the State Department said .
The Obama administration closed 19 embassies and consulates throughout the Middle East and North Africa , and issued a worldwide travel alert due to the threat apparently linked to communications between leaders of the terror group .
The embassy in Sanaa Yemen , where al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in based , will remain closed due to continued concerns about a possible attack .
Separately , the State Department withdrew most of its diplomatic personnel from its consulate in Lahore , Pakistan , on Thursday , citing a `` separate credible threat '' and warned U.S. citizens against travel to Pakistan .
Diplomatic personnel were moved to the capital , Islamabad . The Lahore facility also will remain closed .

Facilities in Yemen and Lahore, Pakistan, will stay closed for now

No link seen between the Pakistan threat and another one by al Qaeda that forced the wider closures

Obama says ""we are not going to completely eliminate terrorism""

All but one of the U.S. diplomatic posts closed this week in a sweeping response to fears of a possible al Qaeda attack will reopen on Sunday, the State Department said.

The Obama administration closed 19 embassies and consulates throughout the Middle East and North Africa, and issued a worldwide travel alert due to the threat apparently linked to communications between leaders of the terror group.

The closures took effect on Sunday.

The embassy in Sanaa Yemen, where al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in based, will remain closed due to continued concerns about a possible attack.

Separately, the State Department withdrew most of its diplomatic personnel from its consulate in Lahore, Pakistan, on Thursday, citing a ""separate credible threat"" and warned U.S. citizens against travel to Pakistan.

Diplomatic personnel were moved to the capital, Islamabad. The Lahore facility also will remain closed.

""We will continue to evaluate the threats to Sanaa and Lahore and make subsequent decisions about the reopening of those facilities based on that information,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement.

""We will also continue to evaluate information about these and all of our posts and to take appropriate steps to best protect the safety of our personnel, American citizens traveling overseas, and visitors to our facilities,"" she added.

`` If [ Iranian leaders ] can not agree to a reasonable deal , they will keep Iran on the path it 's on today , '' he said , according to prepared remarks , `` a path that has isolated Iran , and the Iranian people , from so much of the world , caused so much hardship for Iranian families , and deprived so many young Iranians of the jobs and opportunities they deserve . ''
He went on to frame the current opportunity to secure a deal as fleeting and historic , one , he said , `` we should not miss . ''
The President also said in his Nowruz message that `` the days and weeks ahead will be critical '' for negotiations , and acknowledged that while `` negotiations have made progress ... gaps remain . ''
One of those gaps in the negotiations concerns the number of centrifuges Iran can use to enrich uranium .
While Iran claims its nuclear program is peaceful in nature , the U.S. is determined to restrict the amount of time in which Iran would be able to produce the fissile material for one nuclear weapon -- referred to as `` breakout time '' -- to more than a year . Limiting the number of centrifuges would be key to such a goal .
The delegations , which also include the U.K. , France , Germany , Russia and China , are also seeking to bridge disagreements over how long restrictions would remain on Iran 's nuclear program before they are phased out .
The U.S. is seeking to keep the bulk of restrictions in place for 10 years , according to the AP report . But Blinken told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that the timeframe of the agreement is still being discussed by negotiators .
He also pushed back on the idea that all of the checks on Iran would automatically expire at the end of this period .
`` What we are proposing and what we are seeking to achieve is a series of constraints and obligations , '' he explained . `` Some will end after a long period of time , others will continue longer than that , and still others will be indefinite , in perpetuity . ''

Sanctions have become a key part of the debate in Washington over the Obama administration 's negotiations with Iran , as Republican and some Democratic members of Congress have objected to the deal and shown little inclination to lift sanctions legislators have imposed -- a key form of leverage on Iran .
U.S. officials on Thursday sought to allay some of the concerns .
The officials said that sanctions relief would be phrased -- suspended first and repealed later -- in case Iran violates its commitments , and be dependent on benchmarks such as verification by the U.N. nuclear agency .
However , the officials said the U.S. would be prepared to move quickly with relief if Iran moved quickly with compliance , and that they wanted to makes sure there was significant relief without too much delay because if only a little were given done up front , Iran might feel there is no political benefit in a deal .

John F. Kerry breezed through the hearing Thursday on his nomination as the Obama administration ’ s new secretary of state , facing few tough questions and vowing to mind the image the U.S. projects in a post-9/11 world .
He is likely to be approved easily by the Foreign Relations Committee and soon thereafter by the full Senate , taking over from Hillary Rodham Clinton , who is retiring after four years at the helm of the department .
Mr. Kerry portrayed himself as a staunch advocate of American power , but also a statesman concerned about America ’ s image as an empire too eager to resort to military tactics in a “ complicated and ever more dangerous world . ”
“ Every one of us here knows that American foreign policy is not defined by drones and deployments alone , ” the Massachusetts Democrat told the committee during four hours of hearings .
“ We can not allow the extraordinary good we do to save and change lives to be eclipsed entirely by the role we have had to play since Sept. 11 — a role that was thrust upon us . ”
The hearing opened with a bipartisan bang , when Sen. John McCain , Arizona Republican , appeared alongside Mrs. Clinton and freshman Sen. Elizabeth Warren , Massachusetts Democrat , to formally introduce Mr. Kerry to the panel .
“ He and I have been friends for quite a long time now , ” said Mr. McCain , who added that while he and Mr. Kerry have had “ political differences ” over the years , their friendship is “ based in mutual respect . ”
“ I commend his nomination to you without reservation , ” Mr. McCain said .
Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee , the committee ’ s ranking Republican , said he thinks Mr. Kerry ’ s “ confirmation will go through very , very quickly . ”
Mr. Kerry homed in on Iran during the hearing , saying the U.S. has an “ extraordinary interest ” in stopping the global proliferation of nuclear weapons . He said that includes trying to “ resolve the questions surrounding Iran ’ s nuclear program . ”
“ The president has made it definitive : We will do what we must do to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon , ” Mr. Kerry said . “ I repeat here today : Our policy is not containment . It is prevention . And the clock is ticking on our efforts to secure responsible compliance . ”
On Syria , he defended his belief that Syrian President Bashar Assad had the potential to be a reformer before he began using his army against his own citizens in a civil war that has killed an estimated 60,000 people .
Mr. Kerry ’ s shifting positions on Syria have bothered some senators — especially Republicans who criticize the Obama administration for failing to do more to support Syrian rebels fighting for Mr. Assad ’ s ouster .
On Thursday , Mr. Kerry recalled a visit to Syria during which “ President Assad said to me , ‘ I have 500,000 kids who turn 18 every year , and I don ’ t have a place to put them . ’ ”
Mr. Assad , said Mr. Kerry , wanted to make changes and try to reach “ some kind of an accommodation ” with the West .
“ It ’ s now moot because [ Mr. Assad ] has made a set of judgments that are inexcusable , that are reprehensible and , I think , [ he ] is not long for remaining as the head of state in Syria , ” Mr. Kerry said .
He also faced tough questions about the attack last year on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi , Libya , that killed four Americans , including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens . The attack raised questions about the department ’ s security arrangements , and Sen. Ron Johnson , a Wisconsin Republican who on Wednesday pointedly questioned Mrs. Clinton ’ s handling of the incident , asked Mr. Kerry his thoughts .
“ Senator , if you ’ re trying to get some daylight between me and Secretary Clinton , that ’ s not going to happen , ” Mr. Kerry responded .
Sen. Rand Paul , Kentucky Republican , accused Mr. Kerry of flip-flopping on whether the Constitution prevents a president from authorizing military attacks without congressional approval .
Mr. Kerry supported President Obama ’ s 2011 deployment of American forces to run a no-fly zone over Libya , though he opposed the tactic decades ago with regard to U.S. bombings of Vietnam and Cambodia .
“ Look , ” responded Mr. Kerry , “ you can be absolutist and apply it to every circumstance . The problem is it just doesn ’ t work in some instances . ”","Sen. John F.

“Every one of us here knows that American foreign policy is not defined by drones and deployments alone,” the Massachusetts Democrat told the committee during four hours of hearings.

“We cannot allow the extraordinary good we do to save and change lives to be eclipsed entirely by the role we have had to play since Sept. 11 — a role that was thrust upon us.”

The hearing opened with a bipartisan bang, when Sen. John McCain, Arizona Republican, appeared alongside Mrs. Clinton and freshman Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts Democrat, to formally introduce Mr. Kerry to the panel.

“He and I have been friends for quite a long time now,” said Mr. McCain, who added that while he and Mr. Kerry have had “political differences” over the years, their friendship is “based in mutual respect.”

“I commend his nomination to you without reservation,” Mr. McCain said.

Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, the committee’s ranking Republican, said he thinks Mr. Kerry’s “confirmation will go through very, very quickly.”

Mr. Kerry homed in on Iran during the hearing, saying the U.S. has an “extraordinary interest” in stopping the global proliferation of nuclear weapons. He said that includes trying to “resolve the questions surrounding Iran’s nuclear program.”

“The president has made it definitive: We will do what we must do to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon,” Mr. Kerry said. “I repeat here today: Our policy is not containment. It is prevention. And the clock is ticking on our efforts to secure responsible compliance.”

On Syria, he defended his belief that Syrian President Bashar Assad had the potential to be a reformer before he began using his army against his own citizens in a civil war that has killed an estimated 60,000 people.

Mr. Kerry’s shifting positions on Syria have bothered some senators — especially Republicans who criticize the Obama administration for failing to do more to support Syrian rebels fighting for Mr. Assad’s ouster.

On Thursday, Mr. Kerry recalled a visit to Syria during which “President Assad said to me, ‘I have 500,000 kids who turn 18 every year, and I don’t have a place to put them.’”

Mr. Assad, said Mr. Kerry, wanted to make changes and try to reach “some kind of an accommodation” with the West.

“It’s now moot because [Mr. Assad] has made a set of judgments that are inexcusable, that are reprehensible and, I think, [he] is not long for remaining as the head of state in Syria,” Mr. Kerry said.

He also faced tough questions about the attack last year on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens. The attack raised questions about the department’s security arrangements, and Sen. Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican who on Wednesday pointedly questioned Mrs. Clinton’s handling of the incident, asked Mr. Kerry his thoughts.

“Senator, if you’re trying to get some daylight between me and Secretary Clinton, that’s not going to happen,” Mr. Kerry responded.

Sen. Rand Paul, Kentucky Republican, accused Mr. Kerry of flip-flopping on whether the Constitution prevents a president from authorizing military attacks without congressional approval.

Mr. Kerry supported President Obama’s 2011 deployment of American forces to run a no-fly zone over Libya, though he opposed the tactic decades ago with regard to U.S. bombings of Vietnam and Cambodia.

“Look,” responded Mr. Kerry, “you can be absolutist and apply it to every circumstance. The problem is it just doesn’t work in some instances.”

For both bilateral government relations and the Cuban people , experts in US-Cuba relations predict change will occur , but will be slow .
“ Cuba is changing , but that change is not happening fast enough . Cuba needs to speed up the process of change , ” says Carlos Saladrigas , chairman of the Cuba Study Group , an organization of Cuban-Americans supporting President Obama ’ s opening to Cuba .

The sanitized guest list at the Embassy ’ s flag-raising ceremony may ensure attendance by high-level Cuban officials , but that does not mean the Cuban government has gotten over its suspicions of US intentions , say some Cuban experts close to the government ’ s thinking .
A sizable share of the Cuban government and political elite suspects that the heralded Obama opening to Cuba is really only a “ change in tactics , ” says Carlos Alzugaray Treto , a professor at the University of Havana ’ s Center for Hemispheric and United States Studies .

Still , Alzugaray says change is coming to Cuba , nudged forward by more than just the normalization of relations with the US .

The loose record-keeping practices, which were immediately criticized by historians and open government advocates, are only now being corrected.

“It’s very troubling,” said Nate Jones of the National Security Archive, a non-profit group which gathers and disseminates declassified government records. “People in the community of recordkeepers and historians had known that our history was at risk for a long time….It’s a wake up call, I think, for the public at large, which assumed everyone had Gmail capabilities and didn’t realize how backward the government was.”

The official , who was not authorized to speak on the record and was limited in discussing the contents because of their highly classified nature , was referring to the 22 “ TOP SECRET ” emails that the State Department announced Friday it could not release in any form , even with entire sections redacted .
The announcement fueled criticism of Clinton ’ s handling of highly sensitive information while secretary of state , even as the Clinton campaign continued to downplay the matter as the product of an interagency dispute over classification . But the U.S. government official ’ s description provides confirmation that the emails contained closely held government secrets . “ Operational intelligence ” can be real-time information about intelligence collection , sources and the movement of assets .
The official emphasized that the “ TOP SECRET ” documents were sent over an extended period of time -- from shortly after the server 's 2009 installation until early 2013 when Clinton stepped down as secretary of state .
Separately , Rep. Mike Pompeo , R-Kan. , who sits on the House intelligence committee , said the former secretary of state , senator , and Yale-trained lawyer had to know what she was dealing with .
`` There is no way that someone , a senior government official who has been handling classified information for a good chunk of their adult life , could not have known that this information ought to be classified , whether it was marked or not , ” he said . `` Anyone with the capacity to read and an understanding of American national security , an 8th grade reading level or above , would understand that the release of this information or the potential breach of a non-secure system presented risk to American national security . ''
Pompeo also suggested the military and intelligence communities have had to change operations , because the Clinton server could have been compromised by a third party .
“ Anytime our national security team determines that there 's a potential breach , that is information that might potentially have fallen into the hands of the Iranians , or the Russians , or the Chinese , or just hackers , that they begin to operate in a manner that assumes that information has in fact gotten out , ” Pompeo said .
On ABC 's “ This Week ” on Sunday , one day before the Iowa caucuses , Clinton claimed ignorance on the sensitivity of the materials and stressed that they weren ’ t marked .
`` There is no classified marked information on those emails sent or received by me , '' she said , adding that “ Republicans are going to continue to use it [ to ] beat up on me . ”
Clinton was pressed in the same ABC interview on her signed 2009 non-disclosure agreement which acknowledged that markings are irrelevant , undercutting her central explanation . The agreement states `` classified information is marked or unmarked … including oral communications . ''
Clinton pointed to her aides , saying : `` When you receive information , of course , there has to be some markings , some indication that someone down the chain had thought that this was classified and that was not the case . ”
But according to national security legal experts , security clearance holders are required to speak up when classified information is not in secure channels .
`` Everybody who has a security clearance has an individual obligation to protect the information , '' said national security attorney Edward MacMahon Jr. , who represented former CIA officer Jeffrey Sterling in the high-profile leak investigation regarding a New York Times reporter . `` Just because somebody sends it to you … you ca n't just turn a blind eye and pretend it never happened and pretend it 's unclassified information . ''
These rules , known as the Code of Federal Regulations , apply to U.S. government employees with security clearances and state there is an obligation to report any possible breach by both the sender and the receiver of the information . The rules state : `` Any person who has knowledge that classified information has been or may have been lost , possibly compromised or disclosed to an unauthorized person shall immediately report the circumstances to an official designated for this purpose . ''
The Clinton campaign is now calling for the 22 “ TOP SECRET ” emails to be released , but this is not entirely the State Department 's call since the intelligence came from other agencies , which have final say on classification and handling .
`` The State Department has no authority to release those emails and I do think that Secretary Clinton most assuredly knows that , '' Pompeo said .
Meanwhile , the release of other emails has revealed more about the high-level exchange of classified information on personal accounts . Among the latest batch of emails released by the State Department is an exchange between Clinton and then-Sen. John Kerry , now secretary of state . Sections are fully redacted , citing classified information – and both Kerry and Clinton were using unsecured , personal accounts .
Further , a 2009 email released to Judicial Watch after a federal lawsuit -- and first reported by Fox News -- suggests the State Department 's senior manager Patrick Kennedy was trying to make it easier for Clinton to check her personal email at work , writing to Clinton aide Cheryl Mills a `` stand-alone separate network PC is ... [ one ] great idea . ''
`` The emails show that the top administrator at the State Department , Patrick Kennedy , who is still there overseeing the response to all the inquiries about Hillary Clinton , was in on Hillary Clinton 's separate email network and system from the get-go , '' Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said .
Kennedy is expected to testify this month before the Republican-led Benghazi Select Committee .","EXCLUSIVE: Highly classified Hillary Clinton emails that the intelligence community and State Department recently deemed too damaging to national security to release contain “operational intelligence” – and their presence on the unsecure, personal email system jeopardized “sources, methods and lives,” a U.S. government official who has reviewed the documents told Fox News.

On ABC's “This Week” on Sunday, one day before the Iowa caucuses, Clinton claimed ignorance on the sensitivity of the materials and stressed that they weren’t marked.

""There is no classified marked information on those emails sent or received by me,"" she said, adding that “Republicans are going to continue to use it [to] beat up on me.”

Clinton was pressed in the same ABC interview on her signed 2009 non-disclosure agreement which acknowledged that markings are irrelevant, undercutting her central explanation. The agreement states ""classified information is marked or unmarked … including oral communications.""

Clinton pointed to her aides, saying: ""When you receive information, of course, there has to be some markings, some indication that someone down the chain had thought that this was classified and that was not the case.”

But according to national security legal experts, security clearance holders are required to speak up when classified information is not in secure channels.

""Everybody who has a security clearance has an individual obligation to protect the information,"" said national security attorney Edward MacMahon Jr., who represented former CIA officer Jeffrey Sterling in the high-profile leak investigation regarding a New York Times reporter. ""Just because somebody sends it to you … you can't just turn a blind eye and pretend it never happened and pretend it's unclassified information.""

These rules, known as the Code of Federal Regulations, apply to U.S. government employees with security clearances and state there is an obligation to report any possible breach by both the sender and the receiver of the information. The rules state: ""Any person who has knowledge that classified information has been or may have been lost, possibly compromised or disclosed to an unauthorized person shall immediately report the circumstances to an official designated for this purpose.""

The Clinton campaign is now calling for the 22 “TOP SECRET” emails to be released, but this is not entirely the State Department's call since the intelligence came from other agencies, which have final say on classification and handling.

""The State Department has no authority to release those emails and I do think that Secretary Clinton most assuredly knows that,"" Pompeo said.

Meanwhile, the release of other emails has revealed more about the high-level exchange of classified information on personal accounts. Among the latest batch of emails released by the State Department is an exchange between Clinton and then-Sen. John Kerry, now secretary of state. Sections are fully redacted, citing classified information – and both Kerry and Clinton were using unsecured, personal accounts.

Further, a 2009 email released to Judicial Watch after a federal lawsuit -- and first reported by Fox News -- suggests the State Department 's senior manager Patrick Kennedy was trying to make it easier for Clinton to check her personal email at work, writing to Clinton aide Cheryl Mills a ""stand-alone separate network PC is ... [one] great idea.""

""The emails show that the top administrator at the State Department, Patrick Kennedy, who is still there overseeing the response to all the inquiries about Hillary Clinton, was in on Hillary Clinton's separate email network and system from the get-go,"" Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said.

Kennedy is expected to testify this month before the Republican-led Benghazi Select Committee.",www.foxnews.com,right,kUNqSsV4PgaUDXlF

In conversations with grassroots Democrats around the country and in key nominating states , there is renewed concern that Clinton is saddled with too much baggage and dubious political instincts that could sink her against the GOP nominee if the kinks are not worked out in a contested primary .
`` The Democratic base that is n't wedded to her is nervous about it , '' said Deborah Arnie Arnesen , a progressive radio host in Concord , New Hampshire . `` It makes her more vulnerable . What is this anointed candidate getting us ? A much more flawed candidate than we thought . And Republicans now have material they never thought they would have . ''
`` We need to litigate this in a primary so that she will better at it , or it will be the Republicans who will be doing it for her , '' she added .
The latest round of bad press began last week when the Washington Post reported on foreign government contributions made to the Bill , Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation while she was serving as Secretary of State , including one donation from the Algerian government that may have violated the Obama administration 's ethics policy .

This week , the New York Times broke the news that Clinton exclusively used a private email account to do business at the State Department , allowing her to skirt federal record-keeping practices . The revelation also raised security concerns , though State Department officials said nothing classified passed through her account .
And late Wednesday , Clinton sought to realign herself on the side of transparency , tweeting that she wants `` the public to see my email . ''
`` I asked State to release them . They said they will review them for release as soon as possible , '' Clinton tweeted
But that does n't mean they 'll be released anytime soon . State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said in a statement Thursday that the review process will take `` some time '' because of the volume of emails to sift through .
Clinton supporters have pushed back against the media and Republicans , waving off the stories as yet another Twitter-fueled much-ado-about-nothing that has little resonance with the typical voter beyond Washington .
`` Voters do not give a sh-t about what email Hillary used , '' said Democratic strategist Paul Begala , a longtime Clinton ally and CNN contributor . `` They do n't even give a fart . ''
But if regular voters are n't paying attention , the Democratic power brokers who hold sway over the nomination process in key states — the legislators , local party chairmen and plugged-in activists — most definitely are . The questions some of them are raising are less about the specifics of the stories and more about the long-established narratives they feed : That the secretive Clintons , enabled by unquestioning loyalists , play by their own rules .
`` The questions relating to Hillary are more about , are we tired of the same old thing ? '' asked one prominent Democratic state Senator in South Carolina who wished to remain anonymous . `` It 's time to turn the page and find something that will appeal to voters in South Carolina . People just do n't relate to these national stars like Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama or Nancy Pelosi or whatever . ''
The critical voices in the Democratic Party should not be confused for the majority view . Many Democrats are siding with Clinton through the e-mail flap , underscoring her broad popularity within the party and her undisputed frontrunner status . Recent polls of Iowa Democrats have put Clinton 's lead over her closest potential rival , Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren , at anywhere from 40 to 56 points .
`` This stuff feels kind of petty to me , '' said Cindy Pollard , a Clinton backer and vice-chairman of the Jasper County Democrats in Iowa . `` Like , this is all they got ? ''
But the stories have given new fuel to stalwart Clinton skeptics who , anxious about the prospect of a nominee who has n't been challenged seriously in the national political arena since her ill-fated 2008 campaign , have been demanding other prominent Democrats to join the 2016 race and not give Clinton a free ride .
Some of her critics are unabashed anti-Wall Street progressives who have urged Warren to join the fray . Some are younger Democrats who see the Clintons as emblems of the past , and others are simply skeptical of Clinton 's ability to stir the passions of the Democratic base .
Whatever their motivations , the Anybody-But-Hillary voices have been happy over the last several years to prop up potential rivals and feed reporters quotes about the importance of a Democratic nomination fight instead of a free walk to the nomination for Clinton .
But in recent months , with Warren looking unlikely to run and Clinton lining up blue chip talent for her nascent campaign staff , the critics have lowered their voices and braced for the coming reality of Clinton-as-nominee , even if potential contenders like Maryland Gov . Martin O'Malley , former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders make a run .
While many Democrats are still reluctant to publicly criticize the Clintons — `` Everybody is kind of afraid right now to say anything , '' one of Iowa 's most well-connected Democratic organizers told CNN when asked about the new controversies — others are less likely to pull punches .
In New York , Zephyr Teachout , who challenged New York Gov . Andrew Cuomo from the left in last year 's Democratic Primary , chided Clinton in the New York Daily News over the e-mail flap .
`` She should n't have done it , '' Teachout said . `` She should come forward and give a press availability on it . Just as a matter of leadership , she should address it directly ... This is why we need a primary , to force debate both about policy and leadership style . ''
Dick Harpootlian , a former South Carolina party chairman and supporter of Vice President Joe Biden , said the e-mail story is yet another Clinton scandal to throw on the pile .
`` There 's always another shoe to drop with Hillary , '' Harpootlian told the Washington Post . `` Do we nominate her not knowing what 's in those e-mails ? If the e-mails were just her and her family and friends canoodling about fashion and what they 're going to do next week , that 's one thing . But the fact that she 's already turned e-mails to the Benghazi committee because she was doing official business on it means she 's going to die by 1,000 cuts on this one . ''
Brown , the DNC member , said that party leaders in his state are feeling `` shaky '' about Clinton .
`` Folks are remembering why they pushed back in 2008 , and a candidate with the right message and retail politics could pick the lock Clinton thinks she has on the party faithful , '' Brown said .","A string of damaging stories about Hillary Clinton's activities as Secretary of State -- including the new controversy surrounding her email habits -- are giving fresh ammo to Clinton skeptics who have grown resigned lately to the idea of a Democratic coronation instead of a genuine, competitive primary.

""The closer we get to 2016, the more the electorate pays attention, which we're now seeing with foreign contributions to the Clinton Foundation and in Hillary's undisclosed emails,"" said Boyd Brown, a Democratic National Committee member and former state legislator from South Carolina. ""These are problems that raise real leadership and transparency concerns, concerns that can be addressed in caucuses and primaries, but would go ignored in a coronation process.""

In conversations with grassroots Democrats around the country and in key nominating states, there is renewed concern that Clinton is saddled with too much baggage and dubious political instincts that could sink her against the GOP nominee if the kinks are not worked out in a contested primary.

'Nervous'

""The Democratic base that isn't wedded to her is nervous about it,"" said Deborah Arnie Arnesen, a progressive radio host in Concord, New Hampshire. ""It makes her more vulnerable. What is this anointed candidate getting us? A much more flawed candidate than we thought. And Republicans now have material they never thought they would have.""

""We need to litigate this in a primary so that she will better at it, or it will be the Republicans who will be doing it for her,"" she added.

The latest round of bad press began last week when the Washington Post reported on foreign government contributions made to the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation while she was serving as Secretary of State, including one donation from the Algerian government that may have violated the Obama administration's ethics policy.

This week, the New York Times broke the news that Clinton exclusively used a private email account to do business at the State Department, allowing her to skirt federal record-keeping practices. The revelation also raised security concerns, though State Department officials said nothing classified passed through her account.

And late Wednesday, Clinton sought to realign herself on the side of transparency, tweeting that she wants ""the public to see my email.""

""I asked State to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible,"" Clinton tweeted

But that doesn't mean they'll be released anytime soon. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said in a statement Thursday that the review process will take ""some time"" because of the volume of emails to sift through.

Clinton supporters have pushed back against the media and Republicans, waving off the stories as yet another Twitter-fueled much-ado-about-nothing that has little resonance with the typical voter beyond Washington.

""Voters do not give a sh-t about what email Hillary used,"" said Democratic strategist Paul Begala, a longtime Clinton ally and CNN contributor. ""They don't even give a fart.""

Power brokers

But if regular voters aren't paying attention, the Democratic power brokers who hold sway over the nomination process in key states — the legislators, local party chairmen and plugged-in activists — most definitely are. The questions some of them are raising are less about the specifics of the stories and more about the long-established narratives they feed: That the secretive Clintons, enabled by unquestioning loyalists, play by their own rules.

""The questions relating to Hillary are more about, are we tired of the same old thing?"" asked one prominent Democratic state Senator in South Carolina who wished to remain anonymous. ""It's time to turn the page and find something that will appeal to voters in South Carolina. People just don't relate to these national stars like Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama or Nancy Pelosi or whatever.""

The critical voices in the Democratic Party should not be confused for the majority view. Many Democrats are siding with Clinton through the e-mail flap, underscoring her broad popularity within the party and her undisputed frontrunner status. Recent polls of Iowa Democrats have put Clinton's lead over her closest potential rival, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, at anywhere from 40 to 56 points.

""This stuff feels kind of petty to me,"" said Cindy Pollard, a Clinton backer and vice-chairman of the Jasper County Democrats in Iowa. ""Like, this is all they got?""

New fuel

But the stories have given new fuel to stalwart Clinton skeptics who, anxious about the prospect of a nominee who hasn't been challenged seriously in the national political arena since her ill-fated 2008 campaign, have been demanding other prominent Democrats to join the 2016 race and not give Clinton a free ride.

Some of her critics are unabashed anti-Wall Street progressives who have urged Warren to join the fray. Some are younger Democrats who see the Clintons as emblems of the past, and others are simply skeptical of Clinton's ability to stir the passions of the Democratic base.

Whatever their motivations, the Anybody-But-Hillary voices have been happy over the last several years to prop up potential rivals and feed reporters quotes about the importance of a Democratic nomination fight instead of a free walk to the nomination for Clinton.

But in recent months, with Warren looking unlikely to run and Clinton lining up blue chip talent for her nascent campaign staff, the critics have lowered their voices and braced for the coming reality of Clinton-as-nominee, even if potential contenders like Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders make a run.

Until this week.

While many Democrats are still reluctant to publicly criticize the Clintons — ""Everybody is kind of afraid right now to say anything,"" one of Iowa's most well-connected Democratic organizers told CNN when asked about the new controversies — others are less likely to pull punches.

In New York, Zephyr Teachout, who challenged New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo from the left in last year's Democratic Primary, chided Clinton in the New York Daily News over the e-mail flap.

""She shouldn't have done it,"" Teachout said. ""She should come forward and give a press availability on it. Just as a matter of leadership, she should address it directly ... This is why we need a primary, to force debate both about policy and leadership style.""

Dick Harpootlian, a former South Carolina party chairman and supporter of Vice President Joe Biden, said the e-mail story is yet another Clinton scandal to throw on the pile.

'Always another shoe to drop'

""There's always another shoe to drop with Hillary,"" Harpootlian told the Washington Post. ""Do we nominate her not knowing what's in those e-mails? If the e-mails were just her and her family and friends canoodling about fashion and what they're going to do next week, that's one thing. But the fact that she's already turned e-mails to the Benghazi committee because she was doing official business on it means she's going to die by 1,000 cuts on this one.""

Brown, the DNC member, said that party leaders in his state are feeling ""shaky"" about Clinton.

""Folks are remembering why they pushed back in 2008, and a candidate with the right message and retail politics could pick the lock Clinton thinks she has on the party faithful,"" Brown said.

Timeline shows how Russian lawyer got into US for Trump Jr. meeting,2017-07-14,Brooke Singman,"The Russian attorney whose campaign-season meeting with Donald Trump Jr. has caused headaches for the White House was cleared to enter the U.S. at the time of the visit by the Obama State Department , officials confirmed to Fox News late Thursday .
A brief timeline released overnight helps to resolve questions over how Natalia Veselnitskaya even had legal permission to be in the U.S. And it also shows multiple Obama agencies were involved on multiple occasions in granting access to the lawyer after she was initially denied a visa .
According to the timeline released by the Department of Homeland Security , the Obama Justice and Homeland Security departments granted her a special type of “ parole ” to be in the U.S. from September 2015 through February 2016 to work on a court case in New York . After that expired , according to DHS , the State Department issued her a B1/B2 non-immigrant visa in June 2016 , according to DHS , just in time for her meeting with Trump Jr. , Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort .
That newly revealed meeting has revived congressional scrutiny of the campaign ’ s alleged coordination with Russia , since an intermediary told Trump Jr. the lawyer could have dirt on Hillary Clinton as part of the Russian government ’ s bid to help his dad .
While Trump Jr. has since said , in hindsight , he would have done things differently , his father on Thursday took a more defiant tone and seemed to blame the Obama administration for letting the lawyer into the country .
Her unusual entry into the U.S. has sparked a furious round of finger-pointing among federal agencies , and the buck appears to stop at the State Department , with assistance from both DOJ and DHS .
But the timeline released overnight at least clarifies how she had approval to be in the U.S. , if not why .
“ Ms . Veselnitskaya was subsequently paroled into the U.S. several times between 2015 and 2016 , ending in February 2016 . In June 2016 , she was issued a B1/B2 nonimmigrant visa by the U.S. Department of State , ” a DHS spokesperson told Fox News Thursday night .
DHS officials also said that it was their agency “ in concurrence with the U.S. Attorney 's Office of Southern District of New York ” which paroled Veselnitskaya into the U.S. Fox News confirmed through court documents that Veselnitskaya initially “ applied for a visa to enter the United States , but was denied . ”
Preet Bharara was the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York at the time the parole was granted .

Veselnitskaya was issued a “ Significant Public Benefit Parole ” document on Sept. 25 , 2015 , according to DHS , which expired on Jan. 7 , 2016 . Veselnitskaya requested an extension to continue her work on the case , but the Southern District of New York ’ s attorneys ’ office denied her request .
“ She was not granted a second parole by our office , ” SDNY spokesman James Margolin told Fox news in an email . “ Her case-related immigration parole ended early in 2016 , and it was not renewed by us . ”
The U.S. attorney ’ s office told Fox News on Thursday that Veselnitskaya was indeed granted initial parole by their office , but did not know who , specifically , issued the “ piece of paper . ”
“ Somebody said that her visa or passport to come into the country was approved by Attorney General Lynch , now maybe that ’ s wrong , I just heard that a little while ago… [ that ] she was here because of Lynch , ” Trump said at a joint press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday in Paris .
Prior to DHS pointing fingers at the Department of State , a State spokesperson told Fox News that they had “ no further information to provide. ” The State Department told Fox News Wednesday that the Department is prohibited by the Immigration and Nationality Act from discussing individual visa cases , and told Fox News that all visa applications are adjudicated on a case-by-case basis .
The State Department did not respond to Fox News ’ request to confirm that they issued Veselnitskaya a B1/B2 non-immigrant visa , or comment on Veselnitskaya ’ s current immigration status .
It is unclear as to why Veselnitskaya was denied a visa initially by the Obama State Department , and then granted one in later months .
Acting Chief of Media Relations for U.S . Citizenship and Immigration Services Gillian Christensen told Fox News on Thursday that a range of DHS agencies would typically deal with parole requests , but USCIS was not involved in this particular case .
The type of parole Veselnitskaya was granted is given “ sparingly ” and in “ extraordinary circumstances , ” including urgent humanitarian reasons , such as medical or family emergency . Broadly speaking , Christensen told Fox News that parole may be requested for a person who “ believes his or her presence in the United States will be a significant public benefit , ” and cited participation in a civil court case as an example .
“ Parole allows an individual to enter the United States and remain for a temporary period corresponding to the reason parole was approved , ” Christensen told Fox News . “ Parole is not generally authorized for more than one year . ”
Veselnitskaya was working as an attorney for a Cyprus-based real estate holdings company called Prevezon , run by Denis Katsyv , son of Pyotr Katsyv , one of Russian President Vladimir Putin ’ s closest advisers , and was given “ unlimited resources ” by the Kremlin-connected group to run a campaign to get the Magnitsky Act repealed , Fox News reported Wednesday .

state_department,Washington Post,0,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/14/state-department-cables-warned-safety-issues-wuhan-lab-studying-bat-coronaviruses/,State Department cables warned of safety issues at Wuhan lab studying bat coronaviruses,2020-04-14,"Josh Rogin, National Security","In January 2018 , the U.S. Embassy in Beijing took the unusual step of repeatedly sending U.S. science diplomats to the Wuhan Institute of Virology ( WIV ) , which had in 2015 become China ’ s first laboratory to achieve the highest level of international bioresearch safety ( known as BSL-4 ) . WIV issued a news release in English about the last of these visits , which occurred on March 27 , 2018 . The U.S. delegation was led by Jamison Fouss , the consul general in Wuhan , and Rick Switzer , the embassy ’ s counselor of environment , science , technology and health . Last week , WIV erased that statement from its website , though it remains archived on the Internet .
What the U.S. officials learned during their visits concerned them so much that they dispatched two diplomatic cables categorized as Sensitive But Unclassified back to Washington . The cables warned about safety and management weaknesses at the WIV lab and proposed more attention and help . The first cable , which I obtained , also warns that the lab ’ s work on bat coronaviruses and their potential human transmission represented a risk of a new SARS-like pandemic .
“ During interactions with scientists at the WIV laboratory , they noted the new lab has a serious shortage of appropriately trained technicians and investigators needed to safely operate this high-containment laboratory , ” states the Jan. 19 , 2018 , cable , which was drafted by two officials from the embassy ’ s environment , science and health sections who met with the WIV scientists . ( The State Department declined to comment on this and other details of the story . )
The Chinese researchers at WIV were receiving assistance from the Galveston National Laboratory at the University of Texas Medical Branch and other U.S. organizations , but the Chinese requested additional help . The cables argued that the United States should give the Wuhan lab further support , mainly because its research on bat coronaviruses was important but also dangerous .
As the cable noted , the U.S. visitors met with Shi Zhengli , the head of the research project , who had been publishing studies related to bat coronaviruses for many years . In November 2017 , just before the U.S. officials ’ visit , Shi ’ s team had published research showing that horseshoe bats they had collected from a cave in Yunnan province were very likely from the same bat population that spawned the SARS coronavirus in 2003 .
“ Most importantly , ” the cable states , “ the researchers also showed that various SARS-like coronaviruses can interact with ACE2 , the human receptor identified for SARS-coronavirus . This finding strongly suggests that SARS-like coronaviruses from bats can be transmitted to humans to cause SARS-like diseases . From a public health perspective , this makes the continued surveillance of SARS-like coronaviruses in bats and study of the animal-human interface critical to future emerging coronavirus outbreak prediction and prevention . ”
The research was designed to prevent the next SARS-like pandemic by anticipating how it might emerge . But even in 2015 , other scientists questioned whether Shi ’ s team was taking unnecessary risks . In October 2014 , the U.S. government had imposed a moratorium on funding of any research that makes a virus more deadly or contagious , known as “ gain-of-function ” experiments .
As many have pointed out , there is no evidence that the virus now plaguing the world was engineered ; scientists largely agree it came from animals . But that is not the same as saying it didn ’ t come from the lab , which spent years testing bat coronaviruses in animals , said Xiao Qiang , a research scientist at the School of Information at the University of California at Berkeley .
“ The cable tells us that there have long been concerns about the possibility of the threat to public health that came from this lab ’ s research , if it was not being adequately conducted and protected , ” he said .
There are similar concerns about the nearby Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention lab , which operates at biosecurity level 2 , a level significantly less secure than the level-4 standard claimed by the Wuhan Insititute of Virology lab , Xiao said . That ’ s important because the Chinese government still refuses to answer basic questions about the origin of the novel coronavirus while suppressing any attempts to examine whether either lab was involved .
Sources familiar with the cables said they were meant to sound an alarm about the grave safety concerns at the WIV lab , especially regarding its work with bat coronaviruses . The embassy officials were calling for more U.S. attention to this lab and more support for it , to help it fix its problems .
“ The cable was a warning shot , ” one U.S. official said . “ They were begging people to pay attention to what was going on . ”
No extra assistance to the labs was provided by the U.S. government in response to these cables . The cables began to circulate again inside the administration over the past two months as officials debated whether the lab could be the origin of the pandemic and what the implications would be for the U.S. pandemic response and relations with China .
Inside the Trump administration , many national security officials have long suspected either the WIV or the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention lab was the source of the novel coronavirus outbreak . According to the New York Times , the intelligence community has provided no evidence to confirm this . But one senior administration official told me that the cables provide one more piece of evidence to support the possibility that the pandemic is the result of a lab accident in Wuhan .
“ The idea that it was just a totally natural occurrence is circumstantial . The evidence it leaked from the lab is circumstantial . Right now , the ledger on the side of it leaking from the lab is packed with bullet points and there ’ s almost nothing on the other side , ” the official said .
As my colleague David Ignatius noted , the Chinese government ’ s original story — that the virus emerged from a seafood market in Wuhan — is shaky . Research by Chinese experts published in the Lancet in January showed the first known patient , identified on Dec. 1 , had no connection to the market , nor did more than one-third of the cases in the first large cluster . Also , the market didn ’ t sell bats .
Shi and other WIV researchers have categorically denied this lab was the origin for the novel coronavirus . On Feb. 3 , her team was the first to publicly report the virus known as 2019-nCoV was a bat-derived coronavirus .
The Chinese government , meanwhile , has put a total lockdown on information related to the virus origins . Beijing has yet to provide U.S. experts with samples of the novel coronavirus collected from the earliest cases . The Shanghai lab that published the novel coronavirus genome on Jan. 11 was quickly shut down by authorities for “ rectification. ” Several of the doctors and journalists who reported on the spread early on have disappeared .
On Feb. 14 , Chinese President Xi Jinping called for a new biosecurity law to be accelerated . On Wednesday , CNN reported the Chinese government has placed severe restrictions requiring approval before any research institution publishes anything on the origin of the novel coronavirus .
The origin story is not just about blame . It ’ s crucial to understanding how the novel coronavirus pandemic started because that informs how to prevent the next one . The Chinese government must be transparent and answer the questions about the Wuhan labs because they are vital to our scientific understanding of the virus , said Xiao .
We don ’ t know whether the novel coronavirus originated in the Wuhan lab , but the cable pointed to the danger there and increases the impetus to find out , he said .
“ I don ’ t think it ’ s a conspiracy theory . I think it ’ s a legitimate question that needs to be investigated and answered , ” he said . “ To understand exactly how this originated is critical knowledge for preventing this from happening in the future . ”","In January 2018, the U.S. Embassy in Beijing took the unusual step of repeatedly sending U.S. science diplomats to the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), which had in 2015 become China’s first laboratory to achieve the highest level of international bioresearch safety (known as BSL-4).

In November 2017, just before the U.S. officials’ visit, Shi’s team had published research showing that horseshoe bats they had collected from a cave in Yunnan province were very likely from the same bat population that spawned the SARS coronavirus in 2003.

“Most importantly,” the cable states, “the researchers also showed that various SARS-like coronaviruses can interact with ACE2, the human receptor identified for SARS-coronavirus. This finding strongly suggests that SARS-like coronaviruses from bats can be transmitted to humans to cause SARS-like diseases. From a public health perspective, this makes the continued surveillance of SARS-like coronaviruses in bats and study of the animal-human interface critical to future emerging coronavirus outbreak prediction and prevention.”

The research was designed to prevent the next SARS-like pandemic by anticipating how it might emerge. But even in 2015, other scientists questioned whether Shi’s team was taking unnecessary risks. In October 2014, the U.S. government had imposed a moratorium on funding of any research that makes a virus more deadly or contagious, known as “gain-of-function” experiments.

As many have pointed out, there is no evidence that the virus now plaguing the world was engineered; scientists largely agree it came from animals. But that is not the same as saying it didn’t come from the lab, which spent years testing bat coronaviruses in animals, said Xiao Qiang, a research scientist at the School of Information at the University of California at Berkeley.

“The cable tells us that there have long been concerns about the possibility of the threat to public health that came from this lab’s research, if it was not being adequately conducted and protected,” he said.

There are similar concerns about the nearby Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention lab, which operates at biosecurity level 2, a level significantly less secure than the level-4 standard claimed by the Wuhan Insititute of Virology lab, Xiao said. That’s important because the Chinese government still refuses to answer basic questions about the origin of the novel coronavirus while suppressing any attempts to examine whether either lab was involved.

Sources familiar with the cables said they were meant to sound an alarm about the grave safety concerns at the WIV lab, especially regarding its work with bat coronaviruses. The embassy officials were calling for more U.S. attention to this lab and more support for it, to help it fix its problems.

“The cable was a warning shot,” one U.S. official said. “They were begging people to pay attention to what was going on.”

No extra assistance to the labs was provided by the U.S. government in response to these cables. The cables began to circulate again inside the administration over the past two months as officials debated whether the lab could be the origin of the pandemic and what the implications would be for the U.S. pandemic response and relations with China.

Inside the Trump administration, many national security officials have long suspected either the WIV or the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention lab was the source of the novel coronavirus outbreak. According to the New York Times, the intelligence community has provided no evidence to confirm this. But one senior administration official told me that the cables provide one more piece of evidence to support the possibility that the pandemic is the result of a lab accident in Wuhan.

“The idea that it was just a totally natural occurrence is circumstantial. The evidence it leaked from the lab is circumstantial. Right now, the ledger on the side of it leaking from the lab is packed with bullet points and there’s almost nothing on the other side,” the official said.

As my colleague David Ignatius noted, the Chinese government’s original story — that the virus emerged from a seafood market in Wuhan — is shaky. Research by Chinese experts published in the Lancet in January showed the first known patient, identified on Dec. 1, had no connection to the market, nor did more than one-third of the cases in the first large cluster. Also, the market didn’t sell bats.

Shi and other WIV researchers have categorically denied this lab was the origin for the novel coronavirus. On Feb. 3, her team was the first to publicly report the virus known as 2019-nCoV was a bat-derived coronavirus.

The Chinese government, meanwhile, has put a total lockdown on information related to the virus origins. Beijing has yet to provide U.S. experts with samples of the novel coronavirus collected from the earliest cases. The Shanghai lab that published the novel coronavirus genome on Jan. 11 was quickly shut down by authorities for “rectification.” Several of the doctors and journalists who reported on the spread early on have disappeared.

On Feb. 14, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for a new biosecurity law to be accelerated. On Wednesday, CNN reported the Chinese government has placed severe restrictions requiring approval before any research institution publishes anything on the origin of the novel coronavirus.

The origin story is not just about blame. It’s crucial to understanding how the novel coronavirus pandemic started because that informs how to prevent the next one. The Chinese government must be transparent and answer the questions about the Wuhan labs because they are vital to our scientific understanding of the virus, said Xiao.

We don’t know whether the novel coronavirus originated in the Wuhan lab, but the cable pointed to the danger there and increases the impetus to find out, he said.

“I don’t think it’s a conspiracy theory. I think it’s a legitimate question that needs to be investigated and answered,” he said. “To understand exactly how this originated is critical knowledge for preventing this from happening in the future.”

European allies are troubled by Trump’s “America first” rhetoric, his decision not to certify Iran’s compliance with a nuclear deal, his withdrawal from the Paris climate accord and now plans to move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.

Tillerson told Europe’s foreign ministers at the European Union and NATO that the U.S. government remains committed to transatlantic ties that Trump has previously questioned.

Tillerson also sought to reassure U.S. diplomats posted abroad that his ideas to revamp the country’s foreign service were bearing fruit, saying he would reveal a modernization plan for the U.S. State Department soon.

“CHANGE IN WORLD ORDER”

Diplomats said EU governments face a dilemma because Tillerson’s views are more closely aligned with theirs but may not reflect those of Trump.

Foreign ministers had been open about sharing disagreements with the United States on various issues, Hammond said. One EU diplomat said it was “fairly predictable” given tensions on issues, including Trump’s handling of the North Korea nuclear crisis and his threat to “totally destroy” the secretive country.

“Allies have been very frank today in sharing some of their views,” Hammond said, although he said it was important to be honest, adding that: “dialogues only work if they go two ways.”

WASHINGTON ( AP ) — The State Department has completed its internal investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ’ s use of private email and found violations by 38 people , some of whom may face disciplinary action .
The investigation , launched more than three years ago , determined that those 38 people were “ culpable ” in 91 cases of sending classified information that ended up in Clinton ’ s personal email , according to a letter sent to Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley this week and released Friday . The 38 are current and former State Department officials but were not identified .
Although the report identified violations , it said investigators had found “ no persuasive evidence of systemic , deliberate mishandling of classified information. ” However , it also made clear that Clinton ’ s use of the private email had increased the vulnerability of classified information .
Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said in a tweet Saturday : “ For the umpteenth time the email story is put to bed w/ a clear recognition it was a pointless crusade that took away from so many other issues we should have been discussing in ’ 16 . ”
The investigation covered 33,000 emails that Clinton turned over for review after her use of the private email account became public . The department said it found a total of 588 violations involving information then or now deemed to be classified but could not assign fault in 497 cases .
For current and former officials , culpability means the violations will be noted in their files and will be considered when they apply for or go to renew security clearances . For current officials , there could also be some kind of disciplinary action . But it was not immediately clear what that would be .

WASHINGTON (AP) — The State Department has completed its internal investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s use of private email and found violations by 38 people, some of whom may face disciplinary action.

The investigation, launched more than three years ago, determined that those 38 people were “culpable” in 91 cases of sending classified information that ended up in Clinton’s personal email, according to a letter sent to Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley this week and released Friday. The 38 are current and former State Department officials but were not identified.

Although the report identified violations, it said investigators had found “no persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information.” However, it also made clear that Clinton’s use of the private email had increased the vulnerability of classified information.

Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said in a tweet Saturday: “For the umpteenth time the email story is put to bed w/ a clear recognition it was a pointless crusade that took away from so many other issues we should have been discussing in ’16.”

The investigation covered 33,000 emails that Clinton turned over for review after her use of the private email account became public. The department said it found a total of 588 violations involving information then or now deemed to be classified but could not assign fault in 497 cases.

For current and former officials, culpability means the violations will be noted in their files and will be considered when they apply for or go to renew security clearances. For current officials, there could also be some kind of disciplinary action. But it was not immediately clear what that would be.

The report concluded “that the use of a private email system to conduct official business added an increased degree of risk of compromise as a private system lacks the network monitoring and intrusion detection capabilities of State Department networks.”

The department began the review in 2016 after declaring 22 emails from Clinton’s private server to be “top secret.” Clinton was then running for president against Donald Trump, and Trump made the server a major focus of his campaign.

Then-FBI Director James Comey held a news conference that year in which he criticized Clinton as “extremely careless” in her use of the private email server as secretary of state but said the FBI would not recommend charges.

The Justice Department’s inspector general said FBI specialists did not find evidence that the server had been hacked, with one forensics agent saying he felt “fairly confident that there wasn’t an intrusion.”

USA TODAY

NEW YORK — President-elect Donald Trump is zeroing in on ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as his secretary of State nominee.

Tillerson had his second interview with the president-elect Saturday at Trump Tower and has emerged as the favorite in the long-running competition to lead the State Department, a person familiar with the transition deliberations told USA TODAY on condition of anonymity because Trump has yet to announce his pick.

""In his case, he's much more than a business executive,"" Trump said in an interview to be broadcast on Fox News Sunday. ""I mean, he's a world-class player.""

In the excerpt released by Fox News on Saturday, Trump stopped short of confirming Tillerson as his pick, but praised the 64-year-old executive.

""He's in charge of an oil company that's pretty much double the size of his next nearest competitor. It’s been a company that's been unbelievably managed,"" he said. ""To me a big advantage is that he knows many the players, and he knows them well. He does massive deals in Russia. He does massive deals — not for himself, but for the company.""

It's those deals in Russia that are likely to draw the most scrutiny, especially given his personal relationship with the president of Russia, who awarded him the Order of Friendship, the top Russian honor for a foreign citizen, in 2013.

“I have obviously concerns of reports of his relationship with Vladimir Putin, who is a thug and a murderer,"" Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., told CNN. ""We will have hearings on that issue and other issues concerning him will be examined. That’s the time to make up your mind as to whether to vote yes or no.”

News of Tillerson's emergence came as government officials accuse the Russian government of seeking to intervene in the recent U.S. election, including hacks of Democratic officials' e-mails — all in an effort to boost Trump's chances.

Trump bashes CIA, dismisses Russian hacking report

Putin and Russia have denied the allegations, while Trump has questioned the idea of Russian interference.

And with Trump promising to cancel the Paris climate agreement negotiated by President Obama, the nomination of an oil executive would send a powerful signal that the United States is prepared to buck the global consensus on greenhouse gas emissions.

Trump's weeks-long search for secretary of State has included multiple interviews with 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, former New York City mayor and top adviser Rudy Giuliani, Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Bob Corker, and retired general and ex-CIA director David Petraeus.

Giuliani, who said Friday he was withdrawing from the State Department competition, accompanied Trump to the Army-Navy game Saturday.

Giuliani removes himself from Cabinet consideration

After Trump aides said the list had been narrowed to those four, the president-elect decided to expand his list — a decision that brought his attention to Tillerson.

Trump transition adviser Kellyanne Conway told MSNBC that Tillerson is a ""very intriguing pick to many people. He's already active in Russia, and China and Yemen and the developing world, across our globe. He has the kind of business experience that Donald Trump values.""

Tillerson has worked for Exxon since graduating from college with an engineering degree in 1975, climbing the ranks until he was named CEO in 2006. He has no previous governmental or diplomatic experience.

But as CEO of ExxonMobil, Tillerson has negotiated with countries all over the world for oil exploration rights, particularly in the Middle East and Russia.

Exxon record in spotlight as Trump interviews CEO

Of particular interest in his Senate confirmation hearings would be the $2.2 billion Exxon investment in Russian oil exploration in the Arctic Ocean, which Tillerson negotiated in 2011. That agreement, which also allowed Russian investment in other Exxon ventures around the world, was eventually scuttled after U.S.-imposed sanctions following Russia’s annexation of Crimea.

At Exxon, Tillerson has been critical of international sanctions, saying they’re difficult to impose fairly. He has acknowledged that climate change has been caused by human activity, and has endorsed a carbon tax as “the most efficient means of reflecting the cost of carbon in all economic decisions.”

Vladimir Putin: Russia seeking friends, not enemies

But environmental groups are expected to oppose his Senate confirmation if he's nominated. The New York Attorney General is investigating whether ExxonMobil lied to investors and consumers about the risks of climate change from burning fossil fuels.

“In this position, Tillerson will try his hardest to silence global initiatives and the right of state attorney generals to hold fossil fuel companies legally accountable for climate change,"" said Annie Leonard, executive director of Greenpeace USA.

The secretary of State is also responsible for advancing U.S. policy on human rights. Tillerson, himself an Eagle Scout, was president of the Boy Scouts of America at the time when it began allowing gay scouts, and in 2015 ExxonMobil changed its anti-discrimination policy to include gays and lesbians. But the Human Rights Campaign remains skeptical of the company's policy, saying it was prompted by Obama's 2014 executive order targeting federal contractors, not a change in corporate values.

Everyone, including Hillary Clinton, now agrees that the newly confirmed secretary of State made a mistake in 2009 when she decided, for the sake of “convenience,” to run her own email system out of her home in Chappaqua, N.Y., rather than use an official State Department email account.

But a new report by State's inspector general makes clear that within two years, Clinton's bad decision had turned into something far worse: a threat to national security, one that she repeatedly ignored despite multiple warnings.

Warning No. 1: The report, released last week, reveals that in January 2011, hackers were attacking her private server.

The staffer notified State Department officials of the attempted hack, and Clinton’s top aides there emailed each other to say that “sensitive” matters should not be discussed with Clinton over email.

Warning No. 4: A month later, the State Department sent a cable to “all diplomatic and consular posts” about the dangers of unsecured personal email accounts. Staffers were ordered to “avoid conducting official Department business from your personal e-mail accounts.” Who signed that cable? Hillary Clinton.

I should’ve just used two accounts: Other views

Those warnings, coming in a span of six months, should have made any responsible public official, even one without Clinton’s access to classified information on cyber threats from the vast U.S. intelligence network, aware of the national security dangers of failing to secure the secretary of State’s email communications.

Instead, Clinton and several of her top aides continued to use personal email for sensitive State Department business thousands of times.

If Clinton wants to become the president of the United States, she needs to explain how she could make such a reckless decision. She had a chance to answer questions when the Obama administration-appointed inspector general contacted her about the investigation that was released last week. Among five recent secretaries of State, only Clinton refused.

While Clinton is under potential criminal investigation by the FBI for the mishandling of classified material sent through her email, remaining silent might be in her best interests and it is certainly her right. But to be president, she is going to have to convince voters that she can put the national security of the United States above her own short-term self-interest.

It's already clear that, in using the private email server, Clinton broke the rules. Now it remains to be seen whether she also broke the law.

state_department,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/12/hillary-clinton-emails-contained-signal-intelligen/,Hillary Clinton emails contained signal intelligence from spy satellites,2015-08-12,Rowan Scarborough,"The revelation that Hillary Rodham Clinton ’ s private emails contained sensitive information derived from spy satellites and signal intelligence undercuts her defense that she had no reason to believe she was dealing with classified information , security experts say .
“ If she is so ignorant that she doesn ’ t recognize that this type of information in the email as being classified , it just calls into question her overall competence , ” Larry Johnson , a former CIA analyst trained in the rules of handling government secrets , told The ███ .
As details emerge about the extent of Mrs. Clinton ’ s use of personal email to exclusively conduct business as secretary of state , her defense has shifted .
At first , she stated flatly that her private emails did not hold or transmit classified information . She later amended that defense to claim that none of the information she sent by private email was classified at the time she sent it .
Now , her defenders have evolved her story further , suggesting that she didn ’ t know information she was handling was classified because it wasn ’ t marked as such .
Pete Hoekstra , former chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence , wrote an op-ed published Wednesday in The New York Post calling the latest explanation from the Clinton camp a “ sham . ”
“ The statement ignores how the process works . The reason government officials with security clearances are required to keep their correspondence on the appropriate government server is so the material can be vetted and classified prior to hitting ‘ send ’ to an uncleared recipient , ” Mr. Hoekstra and former federal prosecutor Victoria Toensing wrote in the joint op-ed .
In an interview with The Times , Mr. Hoekstra said that repeating in an email classified information from a report or a secure briefing still violates regulations .
He recalled the extraordinary steps the intelligence community took when it gave him top-secret information . He received the data either in a secure room in a House office , at an off-site FBI facility or on his secure phone .
Asked whether it was possible that Mrs. Clinton dealt with top-secret material but did not know it , Mr. Hoekstra answered : “ Sure , it ’ s always possible that you will have received information from the intelligence community that they consider top secret and you may not be aware of that . Unlikely , but possible . ”
Last month , the inspectors general for the State Department and the intelligence community flatly contradicted Mrs. Clinton ’ s claim that her emails did not contain national secrets . They wrote in a public joint statement that the information among thousands of emails on her private server was definitely classified at the time .
“ These emails were not retroactively classified by the State Department , ” the inspectors general wrote . “ Rather , these emails contained classified information when they were generated and , according to IC classification officials , that information remains classified today . This classified information should never have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system . ”
This week , I. Charles McCullough III , the intelligence community ’ s inspector general , revealed that not only did a small sampling of Mrs. Clinton ’ s 30,000 emails turned over to State contain classified information , but two held data that were top-secret — the highest classification .
Mr. McCullough went further . The top-secret information was labeled “ SI , ” which is intelligence community parlance for “ special intelligence. ” Special intelligence is intercepted communications from foreign targets .
In addition , the intercept came from code word “ talent keyhole , ” ( TK ) , which stands for the nation ’ s military satellites and their production of classified imagery and intercepted communications .
An intelligence spokeswoman said the TK compartmental function “ protects information and activities related to space-based collection of imagery , signals , measurement and signature intelligence , certain products , processing and exploitation techniques , and the design , acquisition , and operation of reconnaissance satellites . ”
“ TOP SECRET/SI/TK ” means her server held some of the nation ’ s most sensitive information . The information could have come from the National Security Agency and most certainly the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency , experts said .
Mr. Johnson , the former CIA analyst , said revelations about the highly sensitive nature of information in certain emails call into question the entirety of Mrs. Clinton ’ s story about the private email server she operated out of her home in Chappaqua , New York .
“ She ’ s admitting she lacks the knowledge and intelligence to recognize classified information . That ’ s her defense ? That she ’ s stupid ? ” he said . “ I think she knew it was classified and used it . They were passing information back and forth . ”
The SI and TK designations mean that if Mrs. Clinton ’ s server was hacked , “ there is the possibility of compromising multiple intelligence sources , ” Mr. Johnson said .
Because Mrs. Clinton conducted all State Department business on one server at her home , it is assumed that her aides also passed classified information on unsecure systems . This is because a commercial system such as Mrs. Clinton ’ s can not communicate with a secure government network set up to handle and protect secrets . Mrs. Clinton did not use a State.gov account , as is expected of all State Department employees .
Intelligence experts said Mrs. Clinton ’ s server , which she turned over under pressure to the Justice Department this week after having vowed never to part with it , was susceptible to hacks from adversaries such as China and Russia .
Mrs. Clinton handed over 30,000 printed emails in December after the special House committee investigating the deadly 2012 attack on a U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi , Libya , pressed the State Department for her emails and discovered they were all on her own server .
Watchdog groups , including Judicial Watch , have filed lawsuits to obtain the emails under the Freedom of Information Act . Prodded by a federal judge , State Department foreign service officers and , more recently , outside intelligence officials , have been sifting through the material to delete government secrets .
The inspectors general estimate that hundreds of emails will be shown to contain classified information before the tedious process is complete .","The revelation that Hillary Rodham Clinton’s private emails contained sensitive information derived from spy satellites and signal intelligence undercuts her defense that she had no reason to believe she was dealing with classified information, security experts say.

“If she is so ignorant that she doesn’t recognize that this type of information in the email as being classified, it just calls into question her overall competence,” Larry Johnson, a former CIA analyst trained in the rules of handling government secrets, told The Washington Times.

As details emerge about the extent of Mrs. Clinton’s use of personal email to exclusively conduct business as secretary of state, her defense has shifted.

At first, she stated flatly that her private emails did not hold or transmit classified information. She later amended that defense to claim that none of the information she sent by private email was classified at the time she sent it.

Now, her defenders have evolved her story further, suggesting that she didn’t know information she was handling was classified because it wasn’t marked as such.

Pete Hoekstra, former chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, wrote an op-ed published Wednesday in The New York Post calling the latest explanation from the Clinton camp a “sham.”

“The statement ignores how the process works. The reason government officials with security clearances are required to keep their correspondence on the appropriate government server is so the material can be vetted and classified prior to hitting ‘send’ to an uncleared recipient,” Mr. Hoekstra and former federal prosecutor Victoria Toensing wrote in the joint op-ed.

In an interview with The Times, Mr. Hoekstra said that repeating in an email classified information from a report or a secure briefing still violates regulations.

He recalled the extraordinary steps the intelligence community took when it gave him top-secret information. He received the data either in a secure room in a House office, at an off-site FBI facility or on his secure phone.

Asked whether it was possible that Mrs. Clinton dealt with top-secret material but did not know it, Mr. Hoekstra answered: “Sure, it’s always possible that you will have received information from the intelligence community that they consider top secret and you may not be aware of that. Unlikely, but possible.”

Last month, the inspectors general for the State Department and the intelligence community flatly contradicted Mrs. Clinton’s claim that her emails did not contain national secrets. They wrote in a public joint statement that the information among thousands of emails on her private server was definitely classified at the time.

“These emails were not retroactively classified by the State Department,” the inspectors general wrote. “Rather, these emails contained classified information when they were generated and, according to IC classification officials, that information remains classified today. This classified information should never have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system.”

This week, I. Charles McCullough III, the intelligence community’s inspector general, revealed that not only did a small sampling of Mrs. Clinton’s 30,000 emails turned over to State contain classified information, but two held data that were top-secret — the highest classification.

Mr. McCullough went further. The top-secret information was labeled “SI,” which is intelligence community parlance for “special intelligence.” Special intelligence is intercepted communications from foreign targets.

In addition, the intercept came from code word “talent keyhole,” (TK), which stands for the nation’s military satellites and their production of classified imagery and intercepted communications.

An intelligence spokeswoman said the TK compartmental function “protects information and activities related to space-based collection of imagery, signals, measurement and signature intelligence, certain products, processing and exploitation techniques, and the design, acquisition, and operation of reconnaissance satellites.”

“TOP SECRET/SI/TK” means her server held some of the nation’s most sensitive information. The information could have come from the National Security Agency and most certainly the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, experts said.

Mr. Johnson, the former CIA analyst, said revelations about the highly sensitive nature of information in certain emails call into question the entirety of Mrs. Clinton’s story about the private email server she operated out of her home in Chappaqua, New York.

Kerry backpedals on 'apartheid state '
Secretary of State John Kerry , under fire for warning that Israel risks becoming “ an apartheid state ” in the absence of a peace deal , released a statement Monday evening pushing back hard .
“ I will not allow my commitment to Israel to be questioned by anyone , particularly for partisan , political purposes , ” Kerry said in a release put out by the State Department . “ … If I could rewind the tape , I would have chosen a different word to describe my firm belief that the only way in the long term to have a Jewish state and two nations and two peoples living side by side in peace and security is through a two state solution . ”
The tape in question was published by the Daily Beast on Sunday — a recording of Kerry ’ s comments to a meeting of the Trilateral Commission on Friday in which he lamented the breakdown of talks between the Israelis and Palestinians .
“ A two-state solution will be clearly underscored as the only real alternative . Because a unitary state winds up either being an apartheid state with second-class citizens — or it ends up being a state that destroys the capacity of Israel to be a Jewish state , ” Kerry says in the recording .
From across the spectrum of right to left , the condemnations rolled in Monday . Anti-Defamation League national director Abe Foxman called the apartheid comment “ startling and deeply disappointing. ” The American Israel Public Affairs Committee said the comment was “ deeply troubling ” and “ inappropriate. ” In a statement , AIPAC said , “ Any suggestion that Israel is , or is at risk of becoming , an apartheid state is offensive and inappropriate . ”
In addition , Republican Jewish Coalition executive director Matt Brooks called it “ inflammatory and inaccurate. ” The National Jewish Democratic Council expressed its “ deep disappointment. ” Sen. Ted Cruz ( R-Texas ) called on Kerry to resign .
Kerry was speaking at the end of the most difficult week yet in his attempts to make progress on peace between the Israelis and Palestinians — and just ahead of the official April 29 deadline for extending negotiations .
Just a few weeks ago , Kerry left the region in frustration and declared “ reality-check time ” when the two sides could not agree to terms in a prisoner exchange . Just last week , Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas announced plans to strike a reconciliation deal with Hamas — which the United States and Israel designate a terrorist organization , but which has political control in the Gaza Strip — ending a nearly decadelong split between that group and Abbas ’ Palestinian Authority , which has control over the West Bank .
Abbas ’ outreach to Hamas drew the condemnation of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , who said Israel would never negotiate with a government that accepts Hamas , which officially calls for the destruction of Israel . In response , the State Department said last week it acknowledged that the reconciliation would create conditions that the Israelis can ’ t be expected to negotiate under .
President Barack Obama gave his own disappointed assessment of the status of the peace process at a news conference Friday in South Korea , adding his own point of warning .
“ There may come a point at which there just needs to be a pause , and both sides need to look at the alternatives , ” Obama said . “ As I ’ ve said in the past and I will continue to repeat : Nobody has offered me a serious scenario in which peace is not made between Israelis and Palestinians and we have a secure , democratic Jewish state of Israel and the Palestinians have a state . ”
Kerry still declared himself hopeful earlier last week — but by Friday , special peace envoy Martin Indyk was headed back to Washington and the secretary of state was blaming both sides in a private meeting with leaders from North America , Western Europe and Japan .
The “ apartheid ” reference in those remarks was an attempt to warn what might happen if the two sides aren ’ t able to reach a solution — though in his apology he said , “ I do not believe , nor have I ever stated , publicly or privately , that Israel is an apartheid state or that it intends to become one . ”
Kerry , in his statement , said that everything in his record showed him to be a strong supporter of Israel , arguing that his word choice had created a “ misimpression . ”
“ For more than thirty years in the United States Senate , I didn ’ t just speak words in support of Israel , I walked the walk when it came time to vote and when it came time to fight . As Secretary of State , I have spent countless hours working with Prime Minister Netanyahu and Justice Minister [ Tzipi ] Livni [ who is leading peace talks for the Israelis ] because I believe in the kind of future that Israel not only wants , but Israel deserves , ” Kerry said . “ I want to see a two state solution that results in a secure Jewish state and a prosperous Palestinian state , and I ’ ve actually worked for it . ”
“ While Justice Minister Livni , former Prime Ministers [ Ehud ] Barak and [ Ehud ] Ohlmert have all invoked the specter of apartheid to underscore the dangers of a unitary state for the future , ” Kerry concluded , “ it is a word best left out of the debate here at home . ”","'I will not allow my commitment to Israel to be questioned by anyone,' Kerry says.

The government 's revelation in U.S. District Court in Washington came in answer to a lawsuit by the Republican National Committee . The RNC had sued over its public records request for all work-related emails sent to or received by Clinton 's former aide , Bryan Pagliano , between 2009 and 2013 , the years of Clinton 's tenure as America 's top diplomat . The lawsuit also pressed for other State Department records from the Clinton era .
The RNC 's filing said lawyers for the agency had informed them in discussions that `` the State Department has represented that no responsive records exist '' for any Pagliano emails . Pagliano was hired at the agency after reportedly setting up Clinton 's server in 2009 , but the lack of any official State Department emails raises the question whether he limited his email traffic using a private account , much like Clinton did during her four years as secretary , or whether his government emails were deleted .
A State Department official said Monday that the agency possessed emails from Pagliano from the period after Clinton 's term had ended , when he continued to work as a technology contractor .
Agency spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau then added Monday evening that some Pagliano emails dating from Clinton 's tenure had been recovered from agency officials ' files and turned over to other organizations , including Senate investigators .
`` We have previously produced through FOIA and to Congress emails sent and received by Mr. Pagliano during Secretary Clinton 's tenure , '' Trudeau said in a public statement . At least one email , which was sent in November 2012 to Clinton from Pagliano -- but possibly from his private email address -- was released as part of 30,000 Clinton emails made public by the agency over the past year .
A spokesman for the RNC said the organization stood by its description of the discussions with lawyers for the State Department . The group said in its filing that `` the State Department has represented that no responsive records exist . ''
Raj Shah , the RNC spokesman , added , `` It 's hard to believe that an IT staffer who set up Hillary Clinton 's reckless email server never sent or received a single work-related email in the four years he worked at the State Department . '' Clinton 's campaign officials declined to comment in response to questions from The Associated Press .
Trudeau said the State Department is working with Congress and several public records requesters to provide relevant material . She also said agency officials continue to search for `` Mr. Pagliano 's emails , which the department may have otherwise retained . '' Trudeau also said the department would respond further to the RNC in court .
State Department officials told Senate investigators last year they could not find a file containing Pagliano 's work emails during Clinton 's tenure , an assertion first reported by Politico .
Fox News reported in March that Pagliano has revealed several details about Clinton 's personal email system to investigators , including who had access to it– as well as when and what devices were used . An intelligence source close to the case told Fox News that Pagliano has been a `` devastating witness '' to Clinton .
The one email sent by Pagliano that surfaced among Clinton 's 30,000 emails was sent to Clinton was a November 2012 birthday greeting . He wished her `` Happy Birthday Madam Secretary . To many more ! ''
Pagliano 's email address was censored , unlike numerous official State Department addresses that are listed in Clinton 's emails -- suggesting he may have sent the message from a private address .
Clinton did not reply directly to Pagliano . Instead , she sent a copy of an email to an aide with the instruction `` Pls respond .

She also said agency officials continue to search for ""Mr. Pagliano's emails, which the department may have otherwise retained."" Trudeau also said the department would respond further to the RNC in court.



State Department officials told Senate investigators last year they could not find a file containing Pagliano's work emails during Clinton's tenure, an assertion first reported by Politico.



Fox News reported in March that Pagliano has revealed several details about Clinton's personal email system to investigators, including who had access to it– as well as when and what devices were used. An intelligence source close to the case told Fox News that Pagliano has been a ""devastating witness"" to Clinton.

The one email sent by Pagliano that surfaced among Clinton's 30,000 emails was sent to Clinton was a November 2012 birthday greeting. He wished her ""Happy Birthday Madam Secretary. To many more!""



Pagliano's email address was censored, unlike numerous official State Department addresses that are listed in Clinton's emails -- suggesting he may have sent the message from a private address.

Clinton did not reply directly to Pagliano. Instead, she sent a copy of an email to an aide with the instruction ""Pls respond.""

state_department,Politico,0,http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/hillary-clinton-emails-214305,The 11 must-read Hillary Clinton emails,2015-09-30,"Rachael Bade, Nick Gass","AP Photo The 11 must-read Hillary Clinton emails From air traffic woes to more technology troubles , the latest release of Clinton emails includes some gems .
The latest trove of Hillary Clinton 's emails shows how the former secretary of state dealt with with major geopolitical events such as the massive release of thousands of diplomatic cables by WikiLeaks and the aftermath of the earthquake disaster in Haiti . But the messages made public by the State Department also show the more personal side of Clinton as she struggles with technology , warns of Sarah Palin 's wrath and develops talking points for Ellen DeGeneres .
Here are a few of the must-read emails from those pages that shed more light on the emails passing through Clinton 's inbox during her State tenure :
When California Rep. Diane Watson was said to be retiring in February 2010 , Clinton vented to aide Huma Abedin about wanting to call Watson but being distracted by a separate fiasco .
`` I 'd like to call her . But right now I 'm fighting w the WH operator who does n't believe I am who I say and wants my direct office line even tho I 'm not there and I just have him my home # and the State Dept # and I told him I had no idea what my direct office # was since I did n't call myself and I just hung up and am calling thru Ops like a proper and properly dependent Secretary of State -- no independent dialing allowed , '' Clinton wrote .
Clinton appeared less than pleased with the State Department 's decision to phase out the terms `` mother '' and `` father '' in favor of `` parent one '' and `` parent two '' in early 2011 .
`` Who made the decision that State will not use the terms 'mother and father ' and instead substitute 'parent one and two ' ? I 'm not defending that decision , which I disagree w and knew nothing about , in front of this Congress . I could live w letting people in nontraditional families choose another descriptor so long as we retained the presumption of mother and father . We need to address this today or we will be facing a huge Fox-generated media storm led by Palin et al , '' she wrote .
In an October 2011 chain with longtime friend Betsy Ebeling , Clinton recounted `` the weirdest exchange '' ever that her husband had on a receiving line the previous day .
`` Did Bill tell you that on the receiving line of his second speech yesterday , he had the weirdest exchange ever when a woman loudly announced that her father 'circumcised Bin Laden ! ' What a claim to fame . Love to all , '' she wrote .
Hillary Clinton was n't always the one sending emails from her personal account .
Abedin sent the following email from the secretary 's personal address in November 2011 , when she said the secretary `` ca n't talk right now . ''
`` Hey its huma [ . ] She ca n't talk right now [ . ] She will call when she gets in car . What flight u on ? Can u email me on other email ? '' Abedin wrote to Clinton aide Jake Sullivan in response to a previous question from the secretary about when he would be able to speak with her .
Then-Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry corresponded with Clinton on her private address in May 2011 , recounting a dinner with Afghan President Hamid Karzai , Gen. David Petraeus and U.S . Ambassador Karl Eikenberry .
Clinton then passed along the email to Sullivan , asking him if he could verify that Kerry was accurately characterizing the Afghan president 's intentions .
Cheryl Mills , Clinton 's chief of staff , sent along a list of talking points in October that Clinton should push in case she ran into Ellen DeGeneres in Los Angeles . State 's Office of the U.S . Global AIDS Coordinator wanted DeGeneres to help promote Clinton 's upcoming HIV/AIDS speech , and DeGeneres served as OGAC 's special envoy for HIV and AIDS awareness later that year .
`` • I 'm very excited about the possibility of your using your incredible platform to help us raise awareness about eliminating HIV/AIDS .
• I 'm giving a speech in two weeks where I 'm going to call upon the world to join the U.S. in creating an AIDS Free Generation .
• Thanks to the science , we are truly on the cusp of making this happen . And if you could help us raise awareness about this historic opportunity , it would be terrific . ''
In December 2010 , Clinton wrote to Sullivan in another email chain , asking if he had received a specific message . Sullivan wrote back that he had not , leading Clinton to write Abedin , informing her that she was still having `` problems '' with emails on her BlackBerry .
`` [ I 'll ] have to find out , '' Abedin said , though it is unclear to what she is referring because of redactions . `` We fixed it both ways , '' she wrote , in making sure that systemwide , `` anyone with a clintonemail.com [ address ] '' would be able to get through the spam filter and to individual computers .
' I really admire what HRC is doing on all this '
In the aftermath of the release of thousands of diplomatic cables by WikiLeaks , deputy secretary Bill Burns wrote to Sullivan that he `` really admire [ d ] '' what Clinton `` is doing on all this . ''
`` It 's not easy , and she 's bearing the brunt of it , '' he wrote , adding that the Defense Department is `` still in denial over their lapses , and their tendency to lowball damage in public is really unhelpful . ''
In another episode of confusion over email addresses , Mills assistant Nora Toiv emailed Abedin and Clinton with her Gmail address information .
`` That 's all I have -- pis send me your state address . Thx . '' Clinton responded .
`` Even weirder -- I just checked and I do have your state but not your gmail -- so how did that happen , '' the secretary pondered . `` Must be the Chinese ! ''
At one point in June 2011 , Clinton wrote that it might be a good idea to publicize the fact that high-level State Department officials were using personal email accounts to conduct official business .
`` I think this makes good sense , '' the secretary wrote in response to a proposal from adviser Anne-Marie Slaughter , who said that someone should `` make a statement '' or `` write an op-ed '' to make that point .
Mills weighed in , saying that former employees would be better to do the publicizing than current ones and that it might be a bad idea to `` telegraph how much folks do or do n't do off state mail b/c it may encourage others who are out there . ''

So Sorry ! ''","AP Photo The 11 must-read Hillary Clinton emails From air traffic woes to more technology troubles, the latest release of Clinton emails includes some gems.

The latest trove of Hillary Clinton's emails shows how the former secretary of state dealt with with major geopolitical events such as the massive release of thousands of diplomatic cables by WikiLeaks and the aftermath of the earthquake disaster in Haiti. But the messages made public by the State Department also show the more personal side of Clinton as she struggles with technology, warns of Sarah Palin's wrath and develops talking points for Ellen DeGeneres.

Here are a few of the must-read emails from those pages that shed more light on the emails passing through Clinton's inbox during her State tenure:

Story Continued Below

Fighting with the White House operator

When California Rep. Diane Watson was said to be retiring in February 2010, Clinton vented to aide Huma Abedin about wanting to call Watson but being distracted by a separate fiasco.

""I'd like to call her. But right now I'm fighting w the WH operator who doesn't believe I am who I say and wants my direct office line even tho I'm not there and I just have him my home # and the State Dept # and I told him I had no idea what my direct office # was since I didn't call myself and I just hung up and am calling thru Ops like a proper and properly dependent Secretary of State--no independent dialing allowed,"" Clinton wrote.

'a huge Fox-generated media storm led by Palin'

Clinton appeared less than pleased with the State Department's decision to phase out the terms ""mother"" and ""father"" in favor of ""parent one"" and ""parent two"" in early 2011.

""Who made the decision that State will not use the terms 'mother and father' and instead substitute 'parent one and two'? I'm not defending that decision, which I disagree w and knew nothing about, in front of this Congress. I could live w letting people in nontraditional families choose another descriptor so long as we retained the presumption of mother and father. We need to address this today or we will be facing a huge Fox-generated media storm led by Palin et al,"" she wrote.

'the weirdest exchange ever'

In an October 2011 chain with longtime friend Betsy Ebeling, Clinton recounted ""the weirdest exchange"" ever that her husband had on a receiving line the previous day.

""Did Bill tell you that on the receiving line of his second speech yesterday, he had the weirdest exchange ever when a woman loudly announced that her father 'circumcised Bin Laden!' What a claim to fame. Love to all,"" she wrote.

'Hey its huma'

Hillary Clinton wasn't always the one sending emails from her personal account.

Abedin sent the following email from the secretary's personal address in November 2011, when she said the secretary ""can't talk right now.""

""Hey its huma[.] She can't talk right now[.] She will call when she gets in car. What flight u on? Can u email me on other email?"" Abedin wrote to Clinton aide Jake Sullivan in response to a previous question from the secretary about when he would be able to speak with her.

Kerry had Clinton's private email

Then-Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry corresponded with Clinton on her private address in May 2011, recounting a dinner with Afghan President Hamid Karzai, Gen. David Petraeus and U.S. Ambassador Karl Eikenberry.

Clinton then passed along the email to Sullivan, asking him if he could verify that Kerry was accurately characterizing the Afghan president's intentions.

Talking points with Ellen

Cheryl Mills, Clinton's chief of staff, sent along a list of talking points in October that Clinton should push in case she ran into Ellen DeGeneres in Los Angeles. State's Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator wanted DeGeneres to help promote Clinton's upcoming HIV/AIDS speech, and DeGeneres served as OGAC's special envoy for HIV and AIDS awareness later that year.

The talking points included:

""• I'm very excited about the possibility of your using your incredible platform to help us raise awareness about eliminating HIV/AIDS.

• I'm giving a speech in two weeks where I'm going to call upon the world to join the U.S. in creating an AIDS Free Generation.

• Thanks to the science, we are truly on the cusp of making this happen. And if you could help us raise awareness about this historic opportunity, it would be terrific.""

BlackBerry 'problems'

In December 2010, Clinton wrote to Sullivan in another email chain, asking if he had received a specific message. Sullivan wrote back that he had not, leading Clinton to write Abedin, informing her that she was still having ""problems"" with emails on her BlackBerry.

""[I'll] have to find out,"" Abedin said, though it is unclear to what she is referring because of redactions. ""We fixed it both ways,"" she wrote, in making sure that systemwide, ""anyone with a clintonemail.com [address]"" would be able to get through the spam filter and to individual computers.

'I really admire what HRC is doing on all this'

In the aftermath of the release of thousands of diplomatic cables by WikiLeaks, deputy secretary Bill Burns wrote to Sullivan that he ""really admire[d]"" what Clinton ""is doing on all this.""

""It's not easy, and she's bearing the brunt of it,"" he wrote, adding that the Defense Department is ""still in denial over their lapses, and their tendency to lowball damage in public is really unhelpful.""

Sullivan forwarded the praise to Clinton.

Must be the Chinese

In another episode of confusion over email addresses, Mills assistant Nora Toiv emailed Abedin and Clinton with her Gmail address information.

""That's all I have--pis send me your state address. Thx."" Clinton responded.

""You've always emailed me on my State email which is toivnf@state.gov,"" Toiv answered.

""Even weirder--I just checked and I do have your state but not your gmail--so how did that happen,"" the secretary pondered. ""Must be the Chinese!""

Email security concerns

At one point in June 2011, Clinton wrote that it might be a good idea to publicize the fact that high-level State Department officials were using personal email accounts to conduct official business.

""I think this makes good sense,"" the secretary wrote in response to a proposal from adviser Anne-Marie Slaughter, who said that someone should ""make a statement"" or ""write an op-ed"" to make that point.

Mills weighed in, saying that former employees would be better to do the publicizing than current ones and that it might be a bad idea to ""telegraph how much folks do or don't do off state mail b/c it may encourage others who are out there.""

""I take this point — Jake also has concerns. Perhaps a better approach is to make the point more quietly to legislators through H,"" Slaughter responded.

HELP — air travel woes

Clinton in July 2011 called on Abedin for emergency air travel assistance, as she was trapped on the tarmac with at least an hour delay.

""I am so unhappy since again no one said a word but as soon as we pulled away from gate we were told we'd wait for 20 minutes and now just told it will be at least an hour but the good news is that they can't keep us out here longer than 3 hours!"" Clinton wrote in an email with the subject line ""HELP."" ""So, I want to go to plan B--pls do all you can to get us flying and if that doesn't work, I want to drive so have asked Service and DS to try to work that out.""

Abedin responded three minutes later at 2:42 p.m., saying, ""... we are equally frustrated watching your flight tracker here. will see if we can call ny and can tell us anything different, and we heard they are also making plans to drive if necesssary. So Sorry!""",www.politico.com,left,XNP0dRERME89EOoW
state_department,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/world/2019/12/3/20938049/brian-hook-trump-iran-maximum-pressure,Trump’s Iran whisperer,2019-12-03,Alex Ward,"The way the wind whipped on the other end of the line , the State Department ’ s special representative for Iran knew the man he ’ d called was at sea .
“ This is Brian Hook , ” the American official said , his voice stern and direct . The connection wasn ’ t great , and the swirling gusts made it hard for the Mediterranean shipping executive on the other end to hear him clearly .
“ This is Brian Hook from the State Department , ” the Iran envoy repeated , hoping his words would cut through the noise . With a hint of resignation in his voice , the shipping executive responded after a long pause , “ I know who you are . ”
Then came the thrust of the conversation : Ensure your ships don ’ t carry Iranian crude , said Hook , or that would defy the Trump administration ’ s maximum pressure campaign against the Islamic Republic .
But to understand just why a high-ranking State Department official would jump on the phone with a shipping magnate , it helps to know a bit more about oil . In particular , Iranian oil .
According to the latest estimates , Iran boasts the third- or fourth-largest oil reserves in the world . Even with obsolete extraction and refining technology , it ’ s bursting with black gold . A find announced just this November added an estimated 53 billion barrels to what are called “ recoverable ” reserves — this one just 180 feet underground . Compared to , say , the complexity and challenge of pulling crude from deepwater drilling rigs in the North Sea or hydraulic fracking in North Dakota , this is basically like scooping oil from a sandbox .
It ’ s not surprising , then , that Iran ’ s economy relies heavily upon crude exports . The problem is that exporting oil has been increasingly hard of late — and Iran ’ s economy is in a parlous way .
The US government — under Hook ’ s direction — has imposed a heavy toll of sanctions on Tehran , limiting the state ’ s ability to conduct financial transactions , import goods , and sell its voluminous reserves of oil on the global market . But the Iranian government hasn ’ t taken this lying down .
Sometimes tankers “ go dark ” as they near Iranian ports , with captains disregarding international rules that require they divulge the ship ’ s position and course . Sometimes Iran employs ship-to-ship transfers — transferring cargo to another seagoing vessel — to make the goods harder to track . And other times the Islamic Republic , or others doing business with it , will forge paperwork to hide what ’ s being exported .
But when Hook gets a tip , he likes to know other important players have the same information . And recently , the envoy has been busy , reaching out directly to a handful of high-powered maritime leaders and at least a dozen ship captains to convince them — through a mixture of threats and financial incentives — not to do business with Iran . “ We are trying to dry up their labor pool to move illicit oil , ” a US official told the Financial Times of the outreach .
The shipping world , then , knows about the bookish lawyer-turned-diplomat . But you ’ d be forgiven if you ’ ve never heard of him . Until recently , most people hadn ’ t .
One of the most important foreign policy officials in the Trump administration , the 51-year-old Iowa native has helped design the administration ’ s new strategy toward Asia and North Korea . He has a hand in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process . And he ’ s close to Trump ’ s inner circle , especially senior White House adviser and presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner .
And for over a year now , he ’ s been serving as the US special representative for Iran , spearheading the president ’ s campaign against the country — placing crushing sanctions on the Islamic Republic ’ s economy to compel it to negotiate a new nuclear deal with America and thoroughly change its behavior .
﻿Trump and Pompeo may be the faces of US foreign policy , then , but Hook is the one working behind the scenes to turn the president ’ s scattershot impulses into a meaningful strategy toward the country .
“ He ’ s the translator , ” said R.C . Hammond , a former top Trump State Department official and Hook friend .
Once a Trump critic , Hook served as a senior official in the George W. Bush administration , a top adviser to Mitt Romney ’ s presidential campaign , and a confidante of former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson . That he worked his way from the heart of the Republican establishment to lead a nontraditional Republican ’ s signature foreign policy remains stunning to many .
“ He ’ s a survivor , ” said a State Department official who , like others interviewed for this story , requested anonymity to speak freely about a colleague .
His survival , though , is now under threat . Current and former State employees — many of whom worked with or for Hook — complain the top diplomat ignores them or shuts them out completely . A State Department report detailed how Hook pushed out a staffer over outside conservative pressure for bigoted and partisan reasons , a conclusion he fiercely denies .
It all adds fodder for his many critics in Congress who say his grasp of Iran policy is rudimentary and overly aggressive . “ I ’ m not a fan of his , ” Sen. Tim Kaine ( D-VA ) , a member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees , told me . “ He is like a John Bolton type : bellicose first , analyze later , if at all , then justify the bellicose actions we take as necessary . I don ’ t think his assessment of the Iran situation shows much real-world connection . ”
Even certain congressional Republicans agree , telling me Hook ’ s personnel problems make it impossible for him to testify in front of Congress again . “ He ’ ll get eaten alive , ” said a senior aide to a Republican senator , noting many top GOP lawmakers and Trump allies still support the envoy .
If things in Washington aren ’ t all warm and fuzzy for Hook , it ’ s not all roses out in the world , either . Hook organized a disastrous international conference that isolated America more than Iran , critics say . Europeans didn ’ t accede to his demands to reform the nuclear deal as the administration initially wanted . Despite the strain on the regime , Tehran lashed out violently to America ’ s withdrawal of the Iran deal by bombing oil fields in Saudi Arabia and restarting its nuclear program . In recent weeks , the government has cracked down on protesters demanding new leadership , killing at least 180 people and perhaps hundreds more .
Tehran ’ s actions , some fear , could set it on a collision course with Washington that could turn into a disastrous war .
Through it all , Hook has stayed out of the limelight , instead finding a place steps from the secretary of state ’ s office and in the heart of the Trump administration . “ We ’ re putting Iran at the center of everything , ” a State Department official told me , “ which puts Hook at the center of everything. ” That makes understanding Hook vital to understanding Trump ’ s foreign policy today — and what it could mean for Iran heading into a critical year .
This account of Hook ’ s career , including his three years at the top of President Trump ’ s foreign policy team , is based on interviews with nearly 20 current and former US officials , congressional members and staff , experts , and people close to him .
The son of a banker , Hook grew up a staunch Catholic with an eye for politics . As a teenager , he watched The McLaughlin Group every Sunday and was dazzled by conservative icon William F. Buckley Jr. Once in college , he called Buckley ’ s agent to express admiration and received an invite to watch the firebrand speak in Bemidji , Minnesota , after which Hook got to eat dinner with the commentator .
They became quick friends , going on sailing trips and holding deep conversations about their Catholic faith , the music of Bach , and books — anything besides politics . Buckley left those conversations for his op-eds and television appearances . Hook admired that Buckley ’ s life was larger than politics , and it ’ s a code the husband and father of three tries to live by in his personal life , those close to him say .
But Hook still pined for politics . He got his first chance in the 1990s , when he worked as a legislative aide to both Iowa Rep. James Leach and Iowa Gov . Terry Branstad ( now the US ambassador to China ) while attending law school . Those who knew him then said he showed an aptitude for public service . After graduating from law school at the University of Iowa in 1999 , Hook moved to Washington — but to practice corporate law at the private firm of Hogan and Hartson .
Working in the nation ’ s capital , Hook increasingly immersed in the political world , and in 2003 joined the Department of Justice under President Bush . He quickly climbed the ladder , serving as a special adviser to the president on policy , where Hook learned the high-stakes and quick tempo operations of the White House . At the United Nations as a special adviser to the ambassador , he gained familiarity with the intricacies of diplomacy , sanctions policy , human rights , and Iran .
He then became the acting assistant secretary of state for international organizations in June 2008 , receiving an official confirmation by the Senate that October — four months before Barack Obama was sworn in as president . “ The fact that he got confirmed so late in the Bush administration shows the strong bipartisan relationships he has , ” Kristen Silverberg , Hook ’ s immediate predecessor in that role , told me .
Those close to Hook attribute that to his outwardly warm , affable demeanor . “ He ’ s political , but not partisan , ” a person close to Hook told me .
His thirst for politics didn ’ t end when he left government at the end of the Bush administration in 2009 . He got to work as the foreign policy adviser for Minnesota Gov . Tim Pawlenty ’ s presidential run . When Pawlenty ’ s campaign ended , Hook moved over to become a senior adviser on Mitt Romney ’ s team , helping him shape the eventual Republican nominee ’ s worldview .
That campaign cycle had an unusual focus on foreign policy . Romney repeatedly assailed Obama ’ s record with the usual Republican talking points : He was weak on terrorism , Russia , North Korea , and Iran ; he embraced dictators instead of allies ; and he shied away from using US military power abroad — particularly in the Middle East — over fears of embroiling the US in another war .
Those arguments , though , weren ’ t quite enough to convince voters to dislodge the incumbent . After Romney lost , Hook , along with his campaign colleagues Eliot Cohen and Eric Edelman , felt they should stick together to keep Romney ’ s internationalism alive and groom the next generation of Republican foreign policy leaders .
They founded the John Hay Initiative , a think tank and advisory group promoting that internationalist vision , in 2013 . “ We ’ re trying to build the bench ” of new Republican foreign policy leaders , Hook told the Wall Street Journal in 2015 .
Peter Feaver , a former Bush administration official who worked for Hook at John Hay , described him as “ charming ” and “ serious , ” adding that Hook “ isn ’ t the kind of sharp-elbowed , sharp-tongued player you encounter in Washington. ” That served Hook well when handling the political side of the group ’ s operations , some said , as he worked contacts in Congress and attracted donors . He managed to do all that while also running his own international consulting firm , Latitude , and engaging in humanitarian projects like improving refugee housing conditions and women ’ s health in sub-Saharan Africa .
Then came candidate Trump and his “ America First ” foreign policy . It was anathema to much of what the initiative stood for . Cohen , Hook ’ s co-lead at John Hay , orchestrated the March 2016 release of a letter signed by 122 GOP foreign policy experts , all agreeing they were “ united in our opposition to a Donald Trump presidency. ” It was one of multiple statements made by so-called “ Never Trumpers ” who argued the candidate ’ s stances were dangerous for the country .
Hook seemingly felt the same way : “ Even if you say you support him as the nominee , ” he told Politico in 2016 , “ you go down the list of his positions and you see you disagree on every one . ”
But Hook didn ’ t sign Cohen ’ s Never Trump letter — or any other public declaration against candidate Trump . The reason , according to those familiar with his thinking , was a mix of patriotism and worry about his future prospects . “ He ’ s not a letter signer , ” a person close to him told me . “ He wants people to serve their country . ”
That reticence , or patriotism , allowed Hook ’ s friend Chris Christie , the former governor of New Jersey and one-time presidential candidate , to pull Hook into the Trump transition team . His name was floated for a top administration job , but it was unclear what exactly it might be .
Hook “ isn ’ t the kind of sharp-elbowed , sharp-tongued player you encounter in Washington . ”
It became more apparent the day before Trump ’ s inauguration . On January 19 , 2017 , the president ’ s pick for secretary of state , then-Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson , held a one-hour meeting with Hook in which they discussed how the administration might run foreign policy . The two men didn ’ t know each other , but by the end , Hook was offered the job as director of policy planning in the State Department and Tillerson ’ s chief foreign policy adviser .
Hook asked his soon-to-be boss what , exactly , would be expected of him in the role . Tillerson , according to a senior department official , simply replied , “ Let ’ s figure it out when you get in . ”
Hook was integral to “ how the building ran ” early in Trump ’ s presidency
The policy planning office ( known internally as S/P ) is akin to the State Department ’ s in-house think tank . Filled with career staffers that span multiple administrations , it ’ s an office for long-term thinking on nearly every challenge facing the country . Whoever leads this team helps set the course of US foreign policy for years , and previous officeholders include prominent figures like George Kennan , Anne-Marie Slaughter , and Richard Haass .
Hook ’ s arrival as director was encouraging for many in the policy office . “ There was a lot of optimism on the team when he joined , ” a former State Department official who worked with Hook told me . “ We thought he ’ d be very helpful since he was at State before , knew how the building worked , and would respect career staff in a way the administration hadn ’ t . ”
Current and former staffers told me that Hook didn ’ t hold a staff meeting for at least his first six weeks in the building . Employees reporting directly to him , many working on top issues like Iran and North Korea , didn ’ t know what their new boss wanted from them . “ There was no direction , no blueprint in terms of how he wanted things to run and what he expected , ” one former staffer told me . “ Colleagues were fighting for work and spent most of their time in the cafeteria with nothing to do . ”
That , in large part , was a function of the broader chaos inside the State Department . While most incoming administrations have teams of people lined up to hit the ground running on Inauguration Day , the Trump administration spent months without top diplomats in place . Other than Tillerson and his deputy , John Sullivan , no other Senate-confirmed appointee at the undersecretary or assistant secretary level came into office for many months , meaning Hook had to spend days and weeks away from his team to travel with Tillerson or brief the White House on policy .
Hook prefers to work in tight teams , State Department officials told me , and he frequently held small-group meetings in his office on North Korea , Iran , China , and ISIS . Those who worked on topics not on the president ’ s priority list didn ’ t get much face time with the boss . Hook likes “ go-getters , ” said a senior department official , and it was up to someone leading a non-priority portfolio to make the case for why they should pay more attention to their issue .
Staffers who got to interact often with Hook , though , came away with a good impression . “ All those willing to offer ideas , written products , and support the process were given meaningful and substantive roles , ” said a current department official in an email . “ This was a meritocracy : excellent written products , fresh ideas , and energy were rewarded. ” Hook “ connected with the secretary and started building a staff process appropriate to his and the interagency ’ s needs . ”
Further , the official offered a theory for why so much ire was reserved for Hook . “ Those folks were not inclined toward constructive and receptive team-building with the incoming secretary and key secretary assistants . This created in S/P a sort of professionally neutral group ready to build bridges with incoming leadership and row hard in a new direction , and a defend-existing-policy/resist change group . ”
That would reflect a general sentiment inside the State Department . There was widespread disillusionment among the ranks — people were suspicious of Trump and his pick , Tillerson . But even among the Trump believers , the highest-level officials didn ’ t have the necessary political support to do their jobs .
Tillerson , for example , was an outsider who hadn ’ t met Trump before being tapped to lead the building . He only came to Trump ’ s attention after top Bush administration officials , like former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and former National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley — both of whom had ties to ExxonMobil — pushed for his appointment .
Between the vacancies and general chaos , Hook quickly rose to the top of the administration ’ s foreign policy team . “ Tillerson , [ State Department Chief of Staff Margaret ] Peterlin , and Hook — that ’ s how the building ran ” early on , a State Department official told me .
Hook ’ s biggest assignment , a directive from the president and the secretary of state , was to convince America ’ s European allies to reform the Iran deal , known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action , or JCPOA .
The negotiated 2015 accord — signed by the five permanent members of the UN Security Council , plus Germany , the EU , and of course , Iran — lifted sanctions on Tehran in exchange for restrictions on its nuclear program and invasive monitoring of facilities . It was one of Obama ’ s signature foreign policy achievements , heralded by Democrats as a historic diplomatic moment and lambasted by Republicans as naive capitulation .
On the campaign trail , Trump called it “ the stupidest deal of all time , ” seemingly because it didn ’ t do anything to address Iran ’ s ballistic missile program or support for terrorism in the region , and because it included a time limit for when the restrictions on its nuclear program would end . He vowed to get the US out of the deal on his first day as president .
But in office , Trump administration officials — many of whom believed the US should remain in the deal , flawed though it may have been — set out to try to negotiate a new side agreement that would address those concerns and keep America in the Iran deal . To do so , the US would first need to get the Europeans on board .
Hook spent months criss-crossing the Atlantic trying to negotiate an enhanced agreement , knowing that Trump ’ s patience with the endeavor was limited .
“ In the event we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress and our allies , then the agreement will be terminated , ” Trump said in an October 2017 speech on Iran strategy . “ It is under continuous review , and our participation can be canceled by me , as president , at any time . ”
The Europeans wouldn ’ t budge , State Department officials told me , because they wanted to stay true to the already-signed agreement and they had business interests in Iran . Whenever Hook would send documents to his European counterparts with language about removing end dates on the nuclear restrictions , they would come back with bright red lines straight through them , a senior department official told me .
Toughening the deal remained administration policy through at least February 2018 , when Hook spoke at a Duke University event moderated by Feaver , a professor there and his former colleague at the John Hay Initiative . “ I know the logic that he was pursuing , and I genuinely believe he was trying to get a deal and to get the Europeans to toughen and sweeten their part to get better leverage on Iran , ” Feaver confided . “ The approach was clearly ‘ Let ’ s fix the Iran deal from inside . ’ ”
It didn ’ t work . During an April 2018 Oval Office meeting , French President Emmanuel Macron tried to convince Trump that Europe was close to agreeing to a Hook-brokered deal in an effort to keep the Obama-era agreement in place — which some US officials suspected was a ruse to placate Trump .
Trump , however , didn ’ t seem to know his own administration ’ s foreign policy was to revamp the Iran deal or even who was leading that effort . Trump ’ s first reaction to Macron ’ s plea for a bit more time was : “ Who ’ s Brian Hook ? ” He pulled the US out of the Iran deal the following month .
Hook still had his admirers in the White House , though , even if he wasn ’ t a household name in the Oval Office . The White House requested his presence often to brief advisers , mainly Stephen Miller and Jared Kushner , on policy , as well as to attend other normal foreign policy meetings .
“ He was at the White House all the time , ” a State Department official told me . “ The White House would call and tell him to come over , and he would oblige. ” Kushner , Miller , and Hook grew close during those many briefings , giving the department leader allies close to the president .
Hook ’ s defenders say his deference to the White House is defensible . Few knew if they were valued by a mercurial president , and the actions of many top officials could be explained — if not forgiven — mostly by their will to survive in the administration . When the president ’ s team calls , you come running , and Hook ’ s phone rang often due to the State Department ’ s many vacancies . He was “ the guy ” because he was the only guy around .
Others , though , claim Hook enjoyed his proximity to power . “ He got excited when he got to go to Mar-a-Lago for a weekend , ” another former State Department employee told me . “ He was really diving in as much as he could with the new team , and that was his only focus . ”
As Hook grew closer to the White House , some career officials in his team suffered . When a high-level Western European delegation came to meet with Hook in February 2017 , no one in the State Department knew about the gathering until that country ’ s embassy called the relevant desk officer hours before they got to the building . That staffer then contacted the policy planning office to ask if they could send someone to take notes .
“ We kind of scrambled and asked Brian if someone other than him could be in the meeting . He agreed , but the sense was he did it to placate us , ” a former department official told me . “ I don ’ t think he trusted his staff . There was a feeling that he was trying to shut us out . ”
For some , that sense of alienation became clearer when Hook assigned two Pentagon detailees to run a project on how to redesign policymaking inside the State Department . Hook entrusted the military officers with the task due to their previous management and planning experience , but it still felt odd to long-time State Department employees to ask military officials to remake years of department operations . They ’ d already been affronted by the bevy of consulting firms brought in by Tillerson to revamp the building ’ s processes .
“ It was a like a civilian going into a war room and telling people how to invade . ”
The final proposal , per five people familiar with the situation , was that Hook ’ s team would lead all policy generation on everything — not just Iran . Afterward , Hook would bring options to Tillerson and his top lieutenants for their approval . The accepted plans would then “ trickle down , ” in the words of one person , from leadership — including the policy planning office — to the rest of the bureaus for implementation .
That idea wasn ’ t overly radical , though . Policy planning directors in the past , including during the Obama administration , wielded immense influence over crafting and executing foreign policy . And despite the extensive expertise throughout the State Department offices in Washington and embassies around the world , it ’ s not unheard of for the secretary to set policy without much input and have staffers execute it .
Tillerson also wanted a bigger say in how his building created policy proposals in top-level administration discussions , especially since he was surrounded by Cabinet officials , like then-Defense Secretary James Mattis , who had immense experience and early influence on the president . Trump constantly boasted about having “ his generals ” by his side ; Tillerson , by contrast , was kept at arm ’ s length . So Hook , according to multiple officials , wanted to give the boss a proposal to satisfy his strong preference for greater influence in US foreign policy .
Many on Hook ’ s team agreed there was ( and remains ) room to streamline and improve the building ’ s processes , but what the military planners devised at Hook ’ s request unsettled his employees .
“ What ’ s the point of having all these experts in your building if you have all these closed-circuit proposals ? ” one former official told me . A current staffer expressed incredulity in more colorful language : “ It was like a civilian going into a war room and telling people how to invade . Sure , trim the fat , but that was like killing ants with a sledgehammer. ” The proposal , like many of Tillerson ’ s reforms , never went into place .
Tillerson continued to entrust his top lieutenants with foreign policymaking , and much of the building felt sidelined by his leadership style . It wasn ’ t just bureaucratic hiccups or sour grapes that angered staffers in his charge , which could be understandable for a new boss in a tumultuous administration . Hook early on became embroiled in a scandal that has put a black mark on his time in government and possibly his future career .
A civil service employee who handled the Iran and Gulf country portfolios for the policy planning team , Sahar Nowrouzzadeh joined the US government in 2005 during the George W. Bush administration . During the Obama years , she helped craft the nuclear deal from inside the White House , an accord that Republicans en masse despised .
“ If there ’ s one thing that unifies Republicans , it ’ s that the Iran deal was not a good deal for security and non-proliferation , ” said Silverberg , Hook ’ s predecessor at the State Department ’ s international organizations bureau and now a top executive at the Business Roundtable .
As Trump came to power , his loyalists looked for any signs that “ deep state ” operatives were conspiring against the president . The paranoia grew as the administration early on suffered leaks about the president ’ s conduct and mishaps throughout the government . The White House was also obsessed with this notion of a bureaucratic attempt to destroy Trump — a message that fit with his stated desire to “ drain the swamp ” of entrenched , unelected officials thwarting the movement he led .
Trump allies began to attack US officials suspected of anti-Trump sentiments . Nowrouzzadeh soon found herself directly in the crosshairs . Not only had she worked on the Iran deal in the Obama administration , but her Iranian heritage raised eyebrows — even though she was born in the United States . Articles in Breitbart and elsewhere claimed she had cried after Trump won the election and unfailingly cited her previous work for the National Iranian American Council , which some say is close to the country ’ s regime . Nowrouzzadeh , her backers note , was just an intern there .
The anti-Nowrouzzadeh campaign soon reached a high-powered audience . Newt Gingrich , the former House speaker and current Trump booster , sent to multiple State Department officials — including Peterlin , Tillerson ’ s chief of staff — a March 14 , 2017 , Conservative Review article claiming she had “ burrowed into the government under President Trump . ”
A report by the State Department ’ s inspector general , released in November after months of investigating Hook ’ s conduct toward Nowrouzzadeh , provides extensive detail on what happened next .
Hook received the Conservative Review article and sent it to a career staffer and his deputy , Ed Lacey . When Hook asked Lacey about Nowrouzzadeh , Lacey said that many people working in the policy planning staff were Obama holdovers .
“ Their picks ” — meaning who was chosen to work in the office during the Obama administration — “ without exception , were Obama/Clinton loyalists not at all supportive of President Trump ’ s foreign policy agenda , ” Lacey emailed , adding that “ all of these detailees have tried to stay on ” the team . “ Ed – This is helpful . Let ’ s discuss on Monday , ” Hook replied .
That was a change of tune for Lacey , who only days before Trump ’ s inauguration had only great things to say about Nowrouzzadeh .
“ Sahar ’ s performance as a Member of the Secretary of State ’ s Policy Planning Staff ( S/P ) over the rating period [ from July 2016 to that point ] has been first rate and has exceeded by far the standards expected of a foreign affairs officer of her grade , ” Lacey wrote to another State Department staffer in a performance review I obtained that has not been previously reported .
“ She is exceptionally well positioned to continue to excel at her position , and should be looked upon very favorably for a promotion as soon as possible so that she can make full use of her talents going forward , ” Lacey concluded .
It ’ s unclear why Lacey ’ s opinion of Nowrouzzadeh changed so sharply with Hook at the helm . What is clear , however , is that Hook — with Lacey ’ s help — wanted to replace her , despite no concrete evidence she did anything to stymie Hook ’ s policies or Trump ’ s Iran strategy .
Several State Department officials saw Nowrouzzadeh go into Hook ’ s office on March 20 , 2017 , in an effort they say was to seek his help against the broadsides . It ’ s unclear what happened during that one-on-one session , but some told me they saw the staffer immediately afterward in her office and noticed she had been crying .
Then in April , Lacey wrote an email to Hook in which he said another department official “ asked me to initiate the process of wrapping up [ Nowrouzzadeh ’ s ] detail . ... Unless I hear otherwise from you , I will do so today. ” Hook simply responded , “ Yes I agree , ” and Lacey then let Nowrouzzadeh go . She formally filed her complaint in May , detailing how unfairly she thought her reassignment was handled .
According to several people familiar with the situation and the IG ’ s report , Lacey told Nowrouzzadeh she was being removed from her role on the Policy Planning Staff because someone else was coming in to handle Iranian affairs . However , that new person — who didn ’ t know Hook personally — didn ’ t arrive until months later , indicating that a normal staffing change wasn ’ t the main reason for her reassignment .
“ Employee One ’ s [ Nowrouzzadeh ’ s ] detail ... ended on or about April 17 , 2017 , although it was scheduled to end on or about July 4 . Mr. McInnis , the replacement Schedule C appointee to cover S/P ’ s Iran work , started in September 2017 , ” the IG ’ s report reads .
Hook , I was told by two State Department officials , never said a word to Nowrouzzadeh after her dismissal .
Hook got a chance to counter the IG ’ s conclusion in the report . “ I did not ‘ acquiesce to pressure ’ to use non-merit factors , ” he responded . “ My personnel decision was lawful , proper , and within the administrative standards for the Department of State. ” He added that once he started work as policy planning chief in February , he already “ intended to hire my own expert for Iran and the Gulf . ”
Hook is still pleading his case . According to a senior administration official , he ’ s telling State Department officials that the IG report was biased against him and faulty from the start . He is considering some sort of direct action against the IG office ’ s staff , but it ’ s unclear what that exactly may be .
Further , Hook argues he couldn ’ t have been biased against Nowrouzzadeh since the two of them didn ’ t interact until that late March meeting , going so far as to say she never sent him a substantive email . But two State Department officials — one current and one former — say that they saw “ multiple ” emails she sent to Hook featuring substantive policy issues on Iran . Many of those emails contained classified information .
Hook ’ s defenders also insist he did everything by the book and that he had the absolute right to form the team he wanted . Nowrouzzadeh , as a holdover from the Obama administration , just didn ’ t gel , they say . Hook felt he knew the Iran portfolio well enough and that Nowrouzzadeh wasn ’ t a “ go-getter , ” anyway . What ’ s more , they note , the IG report doesn ’ t cite a single interview or document that directly ties Hook to forcing out Nowrouzzadeh for bigoted or political reasons .
Tom Shannon , who until February 2018 served as Trump ’ s undersecretary of state for policy — the State Department ’ s third highest-ranking position — told me those arguments don ’ t hold water . “ I saw her in several instances at the White House and State , and she ’ s an absolute professional , ” he said . “ She completely dominates the subject matter that she works on . ”
“ It ’ s offensive to hear her characterized as somehow a slouch , and I think it reflects very poorly on those who are doing this , ” he continued .
Nowrouzzadeh ’ s colleagues were alarmed by what they saw — not only because of what happened , but also because of what they feared might happen to them . “ Morale plummeted , ” said a current State Department staffer , “ and people started jumping ship . ”
Hook ’ s supporters tell a different story . Some people I spoke to said that spirits in the entire policy planning outfit vastly improved after those initial months . Full staff meetings resumed , communication flowed , and Hook ’ s high profile made the team ’ s work extremely important and valued . One person even said they were “ stoked ” to be in that office .
Hammond , the former top State Department official who ’ s close to Hook , said that Hook ’ s time as the policy planning chief was a triumph . His greatest achievement was “ aligning the State Department with a Trump agenda , which was a 180-degree turn from what they had been used to for eight years ” under Obama .
“ Policy planning was completely reinvented under Brian , ” another department official told me .
But when I asked other current and former officials the same question — did Hook have any major successes in the policy planning role ? — all responded with the same sentiment : none .
If any of Hook ’ s early troubles bothered top administration officials , though , it never showed . Trump fired Tillerson on March 13 , 2018 . Per three people familiar with the situation , Hook that same day received a call from Kushner in which the president ’ s son-in-law relayed that Hook ’ s job was safe .
“ Political savvy is what it takes to survive in any presidential administration , but especially one like this with such high turnover , ” a person close to the envoy told me .
After former CIA chief Mike Pompeo was confirmed as secretary of state in April 2018 , he immediately took off for a trip to the Middle East and Europe . Hook was on the plane , and they quickly formed a close partnership over Iran issues .
Hook , like many other Republicans , despised the Iran deal . He called it “ disastrous ” in a Weekly Standard article that came out just four months after the Obama administration made the July 2015 agreement with Tehran . And despite Hook ’ s work to get the Europeans to expand and strengthen the agreement , Pompeo knew Hook was just following Trump and Tillerson ’ s directive , people close to the situation told me .
That policy changed abruptly in May 2018 . “ We can not prevent an Iranian bomb under the decaying and rotten structure of the current agreement , ” Trump said in a White House address . “ Therefore , I am announcing today that the United States will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal. ” Previously lifted sanctions fell back on Iran , and more would soon come .
Weeks later , Pompeo gave a speech at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank in which he laid out 12 ways Iran needed to change before its relations with the US could improve .
The most important demands were for Iran to stop its support for proxy groups , like Hezbollah in Syria and Lebanon ; halt its missile program ; end all nuclear enrichment ; quit threatening US regional allies like Israel and Saudi Arabia ; and allow for international shipping to proceed unimpeded .
The chances of all of those things happening are slim to none , most experts say . But Pompeo named Hook the special representative for Iran policy in August 2018 , and so it became his job to try .
“ The idea of having an envoy for Iran has been talked about for a long time , ” Suzanne Maloney , an Iran expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington , told me . “ It has real value because Iran is a crisis that takes up a lot of diplomatic time and energy , and often spans functional and regional directorates in a way that makes it difficult to have a full-scope policy . ”
Taking that mantle would put Hook at the center of Trump ’ s foreign policy and the combustible Washington debate over how to handle Iran . Opinions differ widely , but two main lines of thought persist . On one hand , some say the US should ’ ve remained in the nuclear deal to keep the proliferation problem at bay and open up dialogue for improved relations . On the other hand , there ’ s a belief Iran won ’ t cow unless it feels immense economic pain . The Trump administration firmly believes in the latter .
With a “ maximum pressure ” campaign , the administration argues it can curtail the worst parts of Tehran ’ s foreign policy : its funding for terrorist organizations that wreak havoc in the Middle East and around the world ; Tehran ’ s stranglehold control over Iraq ; and attacks on US allies like Saudi Arabia .
That ’ s what Hook , and the team of roughly 20 to 30 people in what ’ s known as the Iran Action Group ( IAG ) , have aimed to prove . “ It was our job to define the contours of what ‘ maximum pressure ’ looked like , ” a former senior State Department official told me , “ and then we had to develop and fill in the details . ”
Fill it in they have . In conjunction with the Treasury Department , State Department officials tell me the IAG has sanctioned more than 1,000 Iranian and other individuals — including leaders in Tehran — and entities like the military and oil sector . That means no one in the US can do business with them , and Washington has made it known it will come down hard on anyone else who tries to make deals with the Islamic Republic .
Hook and his team now begin each day by looking at a dashboard of Iran ’ s economic fundamentals — such as the value of the riad or oil exports — to see what effect their moves have had . They seem to have had quite an effect : A year and a half ago , when Hook took on this role , Iran was exporting 2.5 millions barrels per day of oil . That number is now down to half a million .
That ’ s a huge hit to Iran ’ s economy , as oil is central to its economic viability . The US-led pressure campaign has starved the Islamic Republic of an estimated $ 25 billion in oil revenue , per State ’ s estimates I obtained , and Hook ’ s team believes Iran ’ s economy will contract by around 14 percent this year .
To put it mildly , those numbers mean the country is — or is about to be — in a deep depression , and it doesn ’ t help that the country ’ s currency has lost 60 percent of its value against the US dollar . A senior State Department official told me a Middle Eastern foreign minister relayed to him that Javad Zarif , Iran ’ s top diplomat , recently said privately , “ We ’ re dying a slow death . ”
Alireza Miryousefi , the top spokesperson for Iran ’ s mission at the UN , disputed that quote . “ We will not allow them to make us die in a slow death , ” Zarif said , according to Miryousefi .
Iran is clearly feeling the pain . The question , though , is whether the economic downturn will force Tehran ’ s hand . Some in Hook ’ s team believe Iran could collapse by the end of 2020 , three administration officials told me , and they ’ re convinced Tehran will come calling for a meeting soon .
“ Just by surviving as long as he has , Brian has accomplished something . ”
Others believe things will get worse before they get better . They point to Iran ’ s increasingly violent regional escalation to get the US to back down . Tehran has bombed oil tankers , Saudi oil fields , and restarted critical parts of their once-shuttered nuclear program . And the country has cracked down brutally on recent widespread internal protests , despite global condemnation for its actions .
Sen. Kaine , a former Democratic vice presidential candidate , believes this is proof that the Hook-led maximum pressure campaign is failing . “ Iran feels existentially provoked , ” he told me . “ We could easily be like the Guns of August and blunder into a war that would be foolish to be in . ”
Hook ’ s loyalists beg to differ . “ We think our pressure is bigger than their resistance , and they think the opposite , ” a senior State Department official told me .
Recently , Hook ’ s escalation campaign against Iran ’ s most important resource has become even more pointed .
On August 26 , Hook directly emailed an Indian ship captain piloting an Iranian oil tanker in international waters . “ This is Brian Hook , ” he wrote to Akhilesh Kumar . “ I work for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and serve as the US representative for Iran . I am writing with good news . ”
Hook explained that if Kumar took the ship to a country that would impound the vessel on America ’ s behalf , he would receive millions of dollars in compensation through the State Department ’ s Rewards for Justice program , which gives up to $ 15 million for information desired by the US .
Kumar wasn ’ t special , per se : Hook has emailed or called ship captains roughly a dozen times all in an effort to stop Iran from evading US-imposed sanctions .
“ Iran knows that the success of our pressure campaign depends on vigorous enforcement of oil sanctions , ” Hook told the Financial Times in September . “ We have collapsed Iran ’ s oil exports in a short period of time . We are working very closely with the maritime community to disrupt and deter illicit oil exports . ”
That article and word of mouth have clearly raised awareness of Hook ’ s efforts . According to the State Department , the Rewards for Justice program has received over 23,000 tips on Iran during this administration , all hoping to receive some financial reward for information on Iran ’ s sanctions-evading practices . Specific rewards , though , are classified .
Critics of the program , mainly Iranian officials like Zarif , say the plan is nothing less than “ outright blackmail . ”
Hook ’ s supporters , though , say he ’ s done a superb job getting the entire diplomatic apparatus to fall in line with the maximum pressure plan . “ Brian has completely turned a freighter around regarding America ’ s Iran policy , both literally and figuratively , ” Hammond , the top official in Tillerson ’ s State Department , told me .
Even critics note that those accomplishments are impressive , but say the US still hasn ’ t done enough to crush Tehran as hoped . “ They ’ ll survive [ the economic pressure ] and they ’ ll make it difficult ” for the US , Eurasia Group Iran expert Henry Rome told me , “ especially because they want to build leverage for post-2020 negotiations. ” The regime may be helped in the short term by European countries working hard to maintain economic and business ties with Iran .
Iran , it seems , is prepared to wait out Trump and is showing its muscle to a future administration . Others agree : The Trump administration has “ really painted themselves into a corner , ” a department official told me .
In February , for example , the IAG hastily organized a two-day summit in Warsaw meant to recruit more than 60 countries to isolate Tehran as part of the maximum pressure campaign . It ended in total failure as the US isolated itself instead .
Among other embarrassments , the leaders of Germany , France , and the European Union — all members in the Iran nuclear deal — didn ’ t come , despite Hook ’ s invitation . Meanwhile , other European and Arab nations sent low-level delegates to the sessions .
That left top American officials , like Vice President Mike Pence and Pompeo , in an embarrassing position . Usually they would only attend events featuring their counterparts ; in this case , they flew all the way to Poland to hobnob with foreign leaders well below their stature .
It also didn ’ t help that Pence gave a fiery speech , lecturing the Europeans about giving Iran money , even though the accord they still adhere to allows it . It ’ s “ an ill-advised step that will only strengthen Iran , weaken the EU , and create still more distance between Europe and America , ” Pence said . Many in the audience were stunned , officials told me .
That conference and other woes didn ’ t keep Hook out of the running to replace John Bolton as national security adviser in September . Two people familiar with the situation said that Kushner pushed for Hook to get the job , though he ultimately lost out .
The admiration inside the administration , however , hasn ’ t totally translated to Capitol Hill . During an October Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing , Hook testified on Trump ’ s decision to withdraw US troops from Syria , abandoning long-time Kurdish allies and leading to Turkey ’ s incursion to kill them .
Sen. Mitt Romney ( R-UT ) , who Hook supported and advised during the 2012 presidential campaign , asked him if Iran would benefit from a lack of American presence and further chaos in the region . Hook could only respond with a non-answer . “ Our military is in Syria for ISIS , our diplomacy is focused on Iran , ” he said , noting his work on the “ pressure side ” dovetails with his colleagues ’ efforts to find a diplomatic solution in the country .
Romney was incredulous . “ It ’ s astonishing that the Administration ’ s top Iran expert does not believe Turkey ’ s attacks on Kurds in Syria are a game changer in favor of Iran , ” he tweeted about the exchange . “ Kurds are now aligned with Assad , whose regime is backed by Iran ! ”

While he still has many allies on the Hill who admit to being huge Hook fans , some congressional Republicans tell me that that may have been Hook ’ s last official appearance in front of Congress in this administration . Between Tehran ’ s aggressive pushback and his role in Nowrouzzadeh ’ s ouster , they worry Democrats will trash him on camera . Others also admit that Hook isn ’ t that impressive on Iran policy even in private , which makes him expendable as far as they ’ re concerned .
Indeed , Hook may have climbed to the top of Mount Trump , but it ’ s come at the cost of getting on the wrong side of his previously like-minded Republicans . If there was ever a moment to crystalize Hook ’ s journey , it was his dispute with Romney : Seven years earlier , he helped Romney devise an internationalist American foreign policy . Today , he ’ s an emblem of the Trump administration to the world — repping a foreign policy that some say is overly brash , overly aggressive , and overly haphazard .
Whether or not he ultimately succeeds with Iran , many will forever peg him as a Trump guy . Only Hook knows whether it ’ s been worth it , but those who know him understand the situation he ’ s in .
“ This has been an exceptionally difficult administration in which to serve , especially for people of quality , ” Feaver , Hook ’ s former associate , told me . “ Just by surviving as long as he has , Brian has accomplished something . ”","The way the wind whipped on the other end of the line, the State Department’s special representative for Iran knew the man he’d called was at sea.

“This is Brian Hook,” the American official said, his voice stern and direct. The connection wasn’t great, and the swirling gusts made it hard for the Mediterranean shipping executive on the other end to hear him clearly.

“This is Brian Hook from the State Department,” the Iran envoy repeated, hoping his words would cut through the noise. With a hint of resignation in his voice, the shipping executive responded after a long pause, “I know who you are.”

Then came the thrust of the conversation: Ensure your ships don’t carry Iranian crude, said Hook, or that would defy the Trump administration’s maximum pressure campaign against the Islamic Republic.

But to understand just why a high-ranking State Department official would jump on the phone with a shipping magnate, it helps to know a bit more about oil. In particular, Iranian oil.

According to the latest estimates, Iran boasts the third- or fourth-largest oil reserves in the world. Even with obsolete extraction and refining technology, it’s bursting with black gold. A find announced just this November added an estimated 53 billion barrels to what are called “recoverable” reserves — this one just 180 feet underground. Compared to, say, the complexity and challenge of pulling crude from deepwater drilling rigs in the North Sea or hydraulic fracking in North Dakota, this is basically like scooping oil from a sandbox.

It’s not surprising, then, that Iran’s economy relies heavily upon crude exports. The problem is that exporting oil has been increasingly hard of late — and Iran’s economy is in a parlous way.

The US government — under Hook’s direction — has imposed a heavy toll of sanctions on Tehran, limiting the state’s ability to conduct financial transactions, import goods, and sell its voluminous reserves of oil on the global market. But the Iranian government hasn’t taken this lying down.

Sometimes tankers “go dark” as they near Iranian ports, with captains disregarding international rules that require they divulge the ship’s position and course. Sometimes Iran employs ship-to-ship transfers — transferring cargo to another seagoing vessel — to make the goods harder to track. And other times the Islamic Republic, or others doing business with it, will forge paperwork to hide what’s being exported.

But when Hook gets a tip, he likes to know other important players have the same information. And recently, the envoy has been busy, reaching out directly to a handful of high-powered maritime leaders and at least a dozen ship captains to convince them — through a mixture of threats and financial incentives — not to do business with Iran. “We are trying to dry up their labor pool to move illicit oil,” a US official told the Financial Times of the outreach.

The shipping world, then, knows about the bookish lawyer-turned-diplomat. But you’d be forgiven if you’ve never heard of him. Until recently, most people hadn’t.

One of the most important foreign policy officials in the Trump administration, the 51-year-old Iowa native has helped design the administration’s new strategy toward Asia and North Korea. He has a hand in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. And he’s close to Trump’s inner circle, especially senior White House adviser and presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner.

And for over a year now, he’s been serving as the US special representative for Iran, spearheading the president’s campaign against the country — placing crushing sanctions on the Islamic Republic’s economy to compel it to negotiate a new nuclear deal with America and thoroughly change its behavior.

﻿Trump and Pompeo may be the faces of US foreign policy, then, but Hook is the one working behind the scenes to turn the president’s scattershot impulses into a meaningful strategy toward the country.

“He’s the translator,” said R.C. Hammond, a former top Trump State Department official and Hook friend.

Once a Trump critic, Hook served as a senior official in the George W. Bush administration, a top adviser to Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign, and a confidante of former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. That he worked his way from the heart of the Republican establishment to lead a nontraditional Republican’s signature foreign policy remains stunning to many.

“He’s a survivor,” said a State Department official who, like others interviewed for this story, requested anonymity to speak freely about a colleague.

His survival, though, is now under threat. Current and former State employees — many of whom worked with or for Hook — complain the top diplomat ignores them or shuts them out completely. A State Department report detailed how Hook pushed out a staffer over outside conservative pressure for bigoted and partisan reasons, a conclusion he fiercely denies.

It all adds fodder for his many critics in Congress who say his grasp of Iran policy is rudimentary and overly aggressive. “I’m not a fan of his,” Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees, told me. “He is like a John Bolton type: bellicose first, analyze later, if at all, then justify the bellicose actions we take as necessary. I don’t think his assessment of the Iran situation shows much real-world connection.”

Even certain congressional Republicans agree, telling me Hook’s personnel problems make it impossible for him to testify in front of Congress again. “He’ll get eaten alive,” said a senior aide to a Republican senator, noting many top GOP lawmakers and Trump allies still support the envoy.

If things in Washington aren’t all warm and fuzzy for Hook, it’s not all roses out in the world, either. Hook organized a disastrous international conference that isolated America more than Iran, critics say. Europeans didn’t accede to his demands to reform the nuclear deal as the administration initially wanted. Despite the strain on the regime, Tehran lashed out violently to America’s withdrawal of the Iran deal by bombing oil fields in Saudi Arabia and restarting its nuclear program. In recent weeks, the government has cracked down on protesters demanding new leadership, killing at least 180 people and perhaps hundreds more.

Tehran’s actions, some fear, could set it on a collision course with Washington that could turn into a disastrous war.

Through it all, Hook has stayed out of the limelight, instead finding a place steps from the secretary of state’s office and in the heart of the Trump administration. “We’re putting Iran at the center of everything,” a State Department official told me, “which puts Hook at the center of everything.” That makes understanding Hook vital to understanding Trump’s foreign policy today — and what it could mean for Iran heading into a critical year.

This account of Hook’s career, including his three years at the top of President Trump’s foreign policy team, is based on interviews with nearly 20 current and former US officials, congressional members and staff, experts, and people close to him.

“Let’s figure it out when you get in”

The son of a banker, Hook grew up a staunch Catholic with an eye for politics. As a teenager, he watched The McLaughlin Group every Sunday and was dazzled by conservative icon William F. Buckley Jr. Once in college, he called Buckley’s agent to express admiration and received an invite to watch the firebrand speak in Bemidji, Minnesota, after which Hook got to eat dinner with the commentator.

They became quick friends, going on sailing trips and holding deep conversations about their Catholic faith, the music of Bach, and books — anything besides politics. Buckley left those conversations for his op-eds and television appearances. Hook admired that Buckley’s life was larger than politics, and it’s a code the husband and father of three tries to live by in his personal life, those close to him say.

But Hook still pined for politics. He got his first chance in the 1990s, when he worked as a legislative aide to both Iowa Rep. James Leach and Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad (now the US ambassador to China) while attending law school. Those who knew him then said he showed an aptitude for public service. After graduating from law school at the University of Iowa in 1999, Hook moved to Washington — but to practice corporate law at the private firm of Hogan and Hartson.

Working in the nation’s capital, Hook increasingly immersed in the political world, and in 2003 joined the Department of Justice under President Bush. He quickly climbed the ladder, serving as a special adviser to the president on policy, where Hook learned the high-stakes and quick tempo operations of the White House. At the United Nations as a special adviser to the ambassador, he gained familiarity with the intricacies of diplomacy, sanctions policy, human rights, and Iran.

He then became the acting assistant secretary of state for international organizations in June 2008, receiving an official confirmation by the Senate that October — four months before Barack Obama was sworn in as president. “The fact that he got confirmed so late in the Bush administration shows the strong bipartisan relationships he has,” Kristen Silverberg, Hook’s immediate predecessor in that role, told me.

Those close to Hook attribute that to his outwardly warm, affable demeanor. “He’s political, but not partisan,” a person close to Hook told me.

His thirst for politics didn’t end when he left government at the end of the Bush administration in 2009. He got to work as the foreign policy adviser for Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty’s presidential run. When Pawlenty’s campaign ended, Hook moved over to become a senior adviser on Mitt Romney’s team, helping him shape the eventual Republican nominee’s worldview.

That campaign cycle had an unusual focus on foreign policy. Romney repeatedly assailed Obama’s record with the usual Republican talking points: He was weak on terrorism, Russia, North Korea, and Iran; he embraced dictators instead of allies; and he shied away from using US military power abroad — particularly in the Middle East — over fears of embroiling the US in another war.

Those arguments, though, weren’t quite enough to convince voters to dislodge the incumbent. After Romney lost, Hook, along with his campaign colleagues Eliot Cohen and Eric Edelman, felt they should stick together to keep Romney’s internationalism alive and groom the next generation of Republican foreign policy leaders.

They founded the John Hay Initiative, a think tank and advisory group promoting that internationalist vision, in 2013. “We’re trying to build the bench” of new Republican foreign policy leaders, Hook told the Wall Street Journal in 2015.

Peter Feaver, a former Bush administration official who worked for Hook at John Hay, described him as “charming” and “serious,” adding that Hook “isn’t the kind of sharp-elbowed, sharp-tongued player you encounter in Washington.” That served Hook well when handling the political side of the group’s operations, some said, as he worked contacts in Congress and attracted donors. He managed to do all that while also running his own international consulting firm, Latitude, and engaging in humanitarian projects like improving refugee housing conditions and women’s health in sub-Saharan Africa.

Then came candidate Trump and his “America First” foreign policy. It was anathema to much of what the initiative stood for. Cohen, Hook’s co-lead at John Hay, orchestrated the March 2016 release of a letter signed by 122 GOP foreign policy experts, all agreeing they were “united in our opposition to a Donald Trump presidency.” It was one of multiple statements made by so-called “Never Trumpers” who argued the candidate’s stances were dangerous for the country.

Hook seemingly felt the same way: “Even if you say you support him as the nominee,” he told Politico in 2016, “you go down the list of his positions and you see you disagree on every one.”

But Hook didn’t sign Cohen’s Never Trump letter — or any other public declaration against candidate Trump. The reason, according to those familiar with his thinking, was a mix of patriotism and worry about his future prospects. “He’s not a letter signer,” a person close to him told me. “He wants people to serve their country.”

That reticence, or patriotism, allowed Hook’s friend Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey and one-time presidential candidate, to pull Hook into the Trump transition team. His name was floated for a top administration job, but it was unclear what exactly it might be.

Hook “isn’t the kind of sharp-elbowed, sharp-tongued player you encounter in Washington.”

It became more apparent the day before Trump’s inauguration. On January 19, 2017, the president’s pick for secretary of state, then-Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson, held a one-hour meeting with Hook in which they discussed how the administration might run foreign policy. The two men didn’t know each other, but by the end, Hook was offered the job as director of policy planning in the State Department and Tillerson’s chief foreign policy adviser.

Hook asked his soon-to-be boss what, exactly, would be expected of him in the role. Tillerson, according to a senior department official, simply replied, “Let’s figure it out when you get in.”

Hook was integral to “how the building ran” early in Trump’s presidency

The policy planning office (known internally as S/P) is akin to the State Department’s in-house think tank. Filled with career staffers that span multiple administrations, it’s an office for long-term thinking on nearly every challenge facing the country. Whoever leads this team helps set the course of US foreign policy for years, and previous officeholders include prominent figures like George Kennan, Anne-Marie Slaughter, and Richard Haass.

Hook’s arrival as director was encouraging for many in the policy office. “There was a lot of optimism on the team when he joined,” a former State Department official who worked with Hook told me. “We thought he’d be very helpful since he was at State before, knew how the building worked, and would respect career staff in a way the administration hadn’t.”

That hope faded fast for many.

Current and former staffers told me that Hook didn’t hold a staff meeting for at least his first six weeks in the building. Employees reporting directly to him, many working on top issues like Iran and North Korea, didn’t know what their new boss wanted from them. “There was no direction, no blueprint in terms of how he wanted things to run and what he expected,” one former staffer told me. “Colleagues were fighting for work and spent most of their time in the cafeteria with nothing to do.”

That, in large part, was a function of the broader chaos inside the State Department. While most incoming administrations have teams of people lined up to hit the ground running on Inauguration Day, the Trump administration spent months without top diplomats in place. Other than Tillerson and his deputy, John Sullivan, no other Senate-confirmed appointee at the undersecretary or assistant secretary level came into office for many months, meaning Hook had to spend days and weeks away from his team to travel with Tillerson or brief the White House on policy.

Hook prefers to work in tight teams, State Department officials told me, and he frequently held small-group meetings in his office on North Korea, Iran, China, and ISIS. Those who worked on topics not on the president’s priority list didn’t get much face time with the boss. Hook likes “go-getters,” said a senior department official, and it was up to someone leading a non-priority portfolio to make the case for why they should pay more attention to their issue.

Staffers who got to interact often with Hook, though, came away with a good impression. “All those willing to offer ideas, written products, and support the process were given meaningful and substantive roles,” said a current department official in an email. “This was a meritocracy: excellent written products, fresh ideas, and energy were rewarded.” Hook “connected with the secretary and started building a staff process appropriate to his and the interagency’s needs.”

Further, the official offered a theory for why so much ire was reserved for Hook. “Those folks were not inclined toward constructive and receptive team-building with the incoming secretary and key secretary assistants. This created in S/P a sort of professionally neutral group ready to build bridges with incoming leadership and row hard in a new direction, and a defend-existing-policy/resist change group.”

That would reflect a general sentiment inside the State Department. There was widespread disillusionment among the ranks — people were suspicious of Trump and his pick, Tillerson. But even among the Trump believers, the highest-level officials didn’t have the necessary political support to do their jobs.

Tillerson, for example, was an outsider who hadn’t met Trump before being tapped to lead the building. He only came to Trump’s attention after top Bush administration officials, like former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and former National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley — both of whom had ties to ExxonMobil — pushed for his appointment.

Between the vacancies and general chaos, Hook quickly rose to the top of the administration’s foreign policy team. “Tillerson, [State Department Chief of Staff Margaret] Peterlin, and Hook — that’s how the building ran” early on, a State Department official told me.

“Killing ants with a sledgehammer”

Hook’s biggest assignment, a directive from the president and the secretary of state, was to convince America’s European allies to reform the Iran deal, known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA.

The negotiated 2015 accord — signed by the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, plus Germany, the EU, and of course, Iran — lifted sanctions on Tehran in exchange for restrictions on its nuclear program and invasive monitoring of facilities. It was one of Obama’s signature foreign policy achievements, heralded by Democrats as a historic diplomatic moment and lambasted by Republicans as naive capitulation.

On the campaign trail, Trump called it “the stupidest deal of all time,” seemingly because it didn’t do anything to address Iran’s ballistic missile program or support for terrorism in the region, and because it included a time limit for when the restrictions on its nuclear program would end. He vowed to get the US out of the deal on his first day as president.

But in office, Trump administration officials — many of whom believed the US should remain in the deal, flawed though it may have been — set out to try to negotiate a new side agreement that would address those concerns and keep America in the Iran deal. To do so, the US would first need to get the Europeans on board.

Hook spent months criss-crossing the Atlantic trying to negotiate an enhanced agreement, knowing that Trump’s patience with the endeavor was limited.

“In the event we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated,” Trump said in an October 2017 speech on Iran strategy. “It is under continuous review, and our participation can be canceled by me, as president, at any time.”

The Europeans wouldn’t budge, State Department officials told me, because they wanted to stay true to the already-signed agreement and they had business interests in Iran. Whenever Hook would send documents to his European counterparts with language about removing end dates on the nuclear restrictions, they would come back with bright red lines straight through them, a senior department official told me.

Toughening the deal remained administration policy through at least February 2018, when Hook spoke at a Duke University event moderated by Feaver, a professor there and his former colleague at the John Hay Initiative. “I know the logic that he was pursuing, and I genuinely believe he was trying to get a deal and to get the Europeans to toughen and sweeten their part to get better leverage on Iran,” Feaver confided. “The approach was clearly ‘Let’s fix the Iran deal from inside.’”

It didn’t work. During an April 2018 Oval Office meeting, French President Emmanuel Macron tried to convince Trump that Europe was close to agreeing to a Hook-brokered deal in an effort to keep the Obama-era agreement in place — which some US officials suspected was a ruse to placate Trump.

Trump, however, didn’t seem to know his own administration’s foreign policy was to revamp the Iran deal or even who was leading that effort. Trump’s first reaction to Macron’s plea for a bit more time was: “Who’s Brian Hook?” He pulled the US out of the Iran deal the following month.

Hook still had his admirers in the White House, though, even if he wasn’t a household name in the Oval Office. The White House requested his presence often to brief advisers, mainly Stephen Miller and Jared Kushner, on policy, as well as to attend other normal foreign policy meetings.

“He was at the White House all the time,” a State Department official told me. “The White House would call and tell him to come over, and he would oblige.” Kushner, Miller, and Hook grew close during those many briefings, giving the department leader allies close to the president.

Hook’s defenders say his deference to the White House is defensible. Few knew if they were valued by a mercurial president, and the actions of many top officials could be explained — if not forgiven — mostly by their will to survive in the administration. When the president’s team calls, you come running, and Hook’s phone rang often due to the State Department’s many vacancies. He was “the guy” because he was the only guy around.

Others, though, claim Hook enjoyed his proximity to power. “He got excited when he got to go to Mar-a-Lago for a weekend,” another former State Department employee told me. “He was really diving in as much as he could with the new team, and that was his only focus.”

As Hook grew closer to the White House, some career officials in his team suffered. When a high-level Western European delegation came to meet with Hook in February 2017, no one in the State Department knew about the gathering until that country’s embassy called the relevant desk officer hours before they got to the building. That staffer then contacted the policy planning office to ask if they could send someone to take notes.

“We kind of scrambled and asked Brian if someone other than him could be in the meeting. He agreed, but the sense was he did it to placate us,” a former department official told me. “I don’t think he trusted his staff. There was a feeling that he was trying to shut us out.”

For some, that sense of alienation became clearer when Hook assigned two Pentagon detailees to run a project on how to redesign policymaking inside the State Department. Hook entrusted the military officers with the task due to their previous management and planning experience, but it still felt odd to long-time State Department employees to ask military officials to remake years of department operations. They’d already been affronted by the bevy of consulting firms brought in by Tillerson to revamp the building’s processes.

“It was a like a civilian going into a war room and telling people how to invade.”

The final proposal, per five people familiar with the situation, was that Hook’s team would lead all policy generation on everything — not just Iran. Afterward, Hook would bring options to Tillerson and his top lieutenants for their approval. The accepted plans would then “trickle down,” in the words of one person, from leadership — including the policy planning office — to the rest of the bureaus for implementation.

In other words, it would give Hook more power.

That idea wasn’t overly radical, though. Policy planning directors in the past, including during the Obama administration, wielded immense influence over crafting and executing foreign policy. And despite the extensive expertise throughout the State Department offices in Washington and embassies around the world, it’s not unheard of for the secretary to set policy without much input and have staffers execute it.

Tillerson also wanted a bigger say in how his building created policy proposals in top-level administration discussions, especially since he was surrounded by Cabinet officials, like then-Defense Secretary James Mattis, who had immense experience and early influence on the president. Trump constantly boasted about having “his generals” by his side; Tillerson, by contrast, was kept at arm’s length. So Hook, according to multiple officials, wanted to give the boss a proposal to satisfy his strong preference for greater influence in US foreign policy.

Many on Hook’s team agreed there was (and remains) room to streamline and improve the building’s processes, but what the military planners devised at Hook’s request unsettled his employees.

“What’s the point of having all these experts in your building if you have all these closed-circuit proposals?” one former official told me. A current staffer expressed incredulity in more colorful language: “It was like a civilian going into a war room and telling people how to invade. Sure, trim the fat, but that was like killing ants with a sledgehammer.” The proposal, like many of Tillerson’s reforms, never went into place.

Tillerson continued to entrust his top lieutenants with foreign policymaking, and much of the building felt sidelined by his leadership style. It wasn’t just bureaucratic hiccups or sour grapes that angered staffers in his charge, which could be understandable for a new boss in a tumultuous administration. Hook early on became embroiled in a scandal that has put a black mark on his time in government and possibly his future career.

Brian Hook vs. Sahar Nowrouzzadeh

A civil service employee who handled the Iran and Gulf country portfolios for the policy planning team, Sahar Nowrouzzadeh joined the US government in 2005 during the George W. Bush administration. During the Obama years, she helped craft the nuclear deal from inside the White House, an accord that Republicans en masse despised.

“If there’s one thing that unifies Republicans, it’s that the Iran deal was not a good deal for security and non-proliferation,” said Silverberg, Hook’s predecessor at the State Department’s international organizations bureau and now a top executive at the Business Roundtable.

As Trump came to power, his loyalists looked for any signs that “deep state” operatives were conspiring against the president. The paranoia grew as the administration early on suffered leaks about the president’s conduct and mishaps throughout the government. The White House was also obsessed with this notion of a bureaucratic attempt to destroy Trump — a message that fit with his stated desire to “drain the swamp” of entrenched, unelected officials thwarting the movement he led.

Trump allies began to attack US officials suspected of anti-Trump sentiments. Nowrouzzadeh soon found herself directly in the crosshairs. Not only had she worked on the Iran deal in the Obama administration, but her Iranian heritage raised eyebrows — even though she was born in the United States. Articles in Breitbart and elsewhere claimed she had cried after Trump won the election and unfailingly cited her previous work for the National Iranian American Council, which some say is close to the country’s regime. Nowrouzzadeh, her backers note, was just an intern there.

The anti-Nowrouzzadeh campaign soon reached a high-powered audience. Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and current Trump booster, sent to multiple State Department officials — including Peterlin, Tillerson’s chief of staff — a March 14, 2017, Conservative Review article claiming she had “burrowed into the government under President Trump.”

A report by the State Department’s inspector general, released in November after months of investigating Hook’s conduct toward Nowrouzzadeh, provides extensive detail on what happened next.

Hook received the Conservative Review article and sent it to a career staffer and his deputy, Ed Lacey. When Hook asked Lacey about Nowrouzzadeh, Lacey said that many people working in the policy planning staff were Obama holdovers.

“Their picks” — meaning who was chosen to work in the office during the Obama administration — “without exception, were Obama/Clinton loyalists not at all supportive of President Trump’s foreign policy agenda,” Lacey emailed, adding that “all of these detailees have tried to stay on” the team. “Ed – This is helpful. Let’s discuss on Monday,” Hook replied.

That was a change of tune for Lacey, who only days before Trump’s inauguration had only great things to say about Nowrouzzadeh.

“Sahar’s performance as a Member of the Secretary of State’s Policy Planning Staff (S/P) over the rating period [from July 2016 to that point] has been first rate and has exceeded by far the standards expected of a foreign affairs officer of her grade,” Lacey wrote to another State Department staffer in a performance review I obtained that has not been previously reported.

“She is exceptionally well positioned to continue to excel at her position, and should be looked upon very favorably for a promotion as soon as possible so that she can make full use of her talents going forward,” Lacey concluded.

It’s unclear why Lacey’s opinion of Nowrouzzadeh changed so sharply with Hook at the helm. What is clear, however, is that Hook — with Lacey’s help — wanted to replace her, despite no concrete evidence she did anything to stymie Hook’s policies or Trump’s Iran strategy.

Several State Department officials saw Nowrouzzadeh go into Hook’s office on March 20, 2017, in an effort they say was to seek his help against the broadsides. It’s unclear what happened during that one-on-one session, but some told me they saw the staffer immediately afterward in her office and noticed she had been crying.

Then in April, Lacey wrote an email to Hook in which he said another department official “asked me to initiate the process of wrapping up [Nowrouzzadeh’s] detail. ... Unless I hear otherwise from you, I will do so today.” Hook simply responded, “Yes I agree,” and Lacey then let Nowrouzzadeh go. She formally filed her complaint in May, detailing how unfairly she thought her reassignment was handled.

According to several people familiar with the situation and the IG’s report, Lacey told Nowrouzzadeh she was being removed from her role on the Policy Planning Staff because someone else was coming in to handle Iranian affairs. However, that new person — who didn’t know Hook personally — didn’t arrive until months later, indicating that a normal staffing change wasn’t the main reason for her reassignment.

“Employee One’s [Nowrouzzadeh’s] detail ... ended on or about April 17, 2017, although it was scheduled to end on or about July 4. Mr. McInnis, the replacement Schedule C appointee to cover S/P’s Iran work, started in September 2017,” the IG’s report reads.

Hook, I was told by two State Department officials, never said a word to Nowrouzzadeh after her dismissal.

Hook got a chance to counter the IG’s conclusion in the report. “I did not ‘acquiesce to pressure’ to use non-merit factors,” he responded. “My personnel decision was lawful, proper, and within the administrative standards for the Department of State.” He added that once he started work as policy planning chief in February, he already “intended to hire my own expert for Iran and the Gulf.”

Hook is still pleading his case. According to a senior administration official, he’s telling State Department officials that the IG report was biased against him and faulty from the start. He is considering some sort of direct action against the IG office’s staff, but it’s unclear what that exactly may be.

Further, Hook argues he couldn’t have been biased against Nowrouzzadeh since the two of them didn’t interact until that late March meeting, going so far as to say she never sent him a substantive email. But two State Department officials — one current and one former — say that they saw “multiple” emails she sent to Hook featuring substantive policy issues on Iran. Many of those emails contained classified information.

Hook’s defenders also insist he did everything by the book and that he had the absolute right to form the team he wanted. Nowrouzzadeh, as a holdover from the Obama administration, just didn’t gel, they say. Hook felt he knew the Iran portfolio well enough and that Nowrouzzadeh wasn’t a “go-getter,” anyway. What’s more, they note, the IG report doesn’t cite a single interview or document that directly ties Hook to forcing out Nowrouzzadeh for bigoted or political reasons.

Tom Shannon, who until February 2018 served as Trump’s undersecretary of state for policy — the State Department’s third highest-ranking position — told me those arguments don’t hold water. “I saw her in several instances at the White House and State, and she’s an absolute professional,” he said. “She completely dominates the subject matter that she works on.”

“It’s offensive to hear her characterized as somehow a slouch, and I think it reflects very poorly on those who are doing this,” he continued.

Nowrouzzadeh’s colleagues were alarmed by what they saw — not only because of what happened, but also because of what they feared might happen to them. “Morale plummeted,” said a current State Department staffer, “and people started jumping ship.”

Hook’s supporters tell a different story. Some people I spoke to said that spirits in the entire policy planning outfit vastly improved after those initial months. Full staff meetings resumed, communication flowed, and Hook’s high profile made the team’s work extremely important and valued. One person even said they were “stoked” to be in that office.

Hammond, the former top State Department official who’s close to Hook, said that Hook’s time as the policy planning chief was a triumph. His greatest achievement was “aligning the State Department with a Trump agenda, which was a 180-degree turn from what they had been used to for eight years” under Obama.

“Policy planning was completely reinvented under Brian,” another department official told me.

But when I asked other current and former officials the same question — did Hook have any major successes in the policy planning role? — all responded with the same sentiment: none.

If any of Hook’s early troubles bothered top administration officials, though, it never showed. Trump fired Tillerson on March 13, 2018. Per three people familiar with the situation, Hook that same day received a call from Kushner in which the president’s son-in-law relayed that Hook’s job was safe.

“Political savvy is what it takes to survive in any presidential administration, but especially one like this with such high turnover,” a person close to the envoy told me.

Hook takes over as Trump’s Iran envoy

After former CIA chief Mike Pompeo was confirmed as secretary of state in April 2018, he immediately took off for a trip to the Middle East and Europe. Hook was on the plane, and they quickly formed a close partnership over Iran issues.

Hook, like many other Republicans, despised the Iran deal. He called it “disastrous” in a Weekly Standard article that came out just four months after the Obama administration made the July 2015 agreement with Tehran. And despite Hook’s work to get the Europeans to expand and strengthen the agreement, Pompeo knew Hook was just following Trump and Tillerson’s directive, people close to the situation told me.

That policy changed abruptly in May 2018. “We cannot prevent an Iranian bomb under the decaying and rotten structure of the current agreement,” Trump said in a White House address. “Therefore, I am announcing today that the United States will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal.” Previously lifted sanctions fell back on Iran, and more would soon come.

Weeks later, Pompeo gave a speech at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank in which he laid out 12 ways Iran needed to change before its relations with the US could improve.

The most important demands were for Iran to stop its support for proxy groups, like Hezbollah in Syria and Lebanon; halt its missile program; end all nuclear enrichment; quit threatening US regional allies like Israel and Saudi Arabia; and allow for international shipping to proceed unimpeded.

The chances of all of those things happening are slim to none, most experts say. But Pompeo named Hook the special representative for Iran policy in August 2018, and so it became his job to try.

“The idea of having an envoy for Iran has been talked about for a long time,” Suzanne Maloney, an Iran expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington, told me. “It has real value because Iran is a crisis that takes up a lot of diplomatic time and energy, and often spans functional and regional directorates in a way that makes it difficult to have a full-scope policy.”

Taking that mantle would put Hook at the center of Trump’s foreign policy and the combustible Washington debate over how to handle Iran. Opinions differ widely, but two main lines of thought persist. On one hand, some say the US should’ve remained in the nuclear deal to keep the proliferation problem at bay and open up dialogue for improved relations. On the other hand, there’s a belief Iran won’t cow unless it feels immense economic pain. The Trump administration firmly believes in the latter.

With a “maximum pressure” campaign, the administration argues it can curtail the worst parts of Tehran’s foreign policy: its funding for terrorist organizations that wreak havoc in the Middle East and around the world; Tehran’s stranglehold control over Iraq; and attacks on US allies like Saudi Arabia.

That’s what Hook, and the team of roughly 20 to 30 people in what’s known as the Iran Action Group (IAG), have aimed to prove. “It was our job to define the contours of what ‘maximum pressure’ looked like,” a former senior State Department official told me, “and then we had to develop and fill in the details.”

Fill it in they have. In conjunction with the Treasury Department, State Department officials tell me the IAG has sanctioned more than 1,000 Iranian and other individuals — including leaders in Tehran — and entities like the military and oil sector. That means no one in the US can do business with them, and Washington has made it known it will come down hard on anyone else who tries to make deals with the Islamic Republic.

Hook and his team now begin each day by looking at a dashboard of Iran’s economic fundamentals — such as the value of the riad or oil exports — to see what effect their moves have had. They seem to have had quite an effect: A year and a half ago, when Hook took on this role, Iran was exporting 2.5 millions barrels per day of oil. That number is now down to half a million.

That’s a huge hit to Iran’s economy, as oil is central to its economic viability. The US-led pressure campaign has starved the Islamic Republic of an estimated $25 billion in oil revenue, per State’s estimates I obtained, and Hook’s team believes Iran’s economy will contract by around 14 percent this year.

To put it mildly, those numbers mean the country is — or is about to be — in a deep depression, and it doesn’t help that the country’s currency has lost 60 percent of its value against the US dollar. A senior State Department official told me a Middle Eastern foreign minister relayed to him that Javad Zarif, Iran’s top diplomat, recently said privately, “We’re dying a slow death.”

Alireza Miryousefi, the top spokesperson for Iran’s mission at the UN, disputed that quote. “We will not allow them to make us die in a slow death,” Zarif said, according to Miryousefi.

Iran is clearly feeling the pain. The question, though, is whether the economic downturn will force Tehran’s hand. Some in Hook’s team believe Iran could collapse by the end of 2020, three administration officials told me, and they’re convinced Tehran will come calling for a meeting soon.

“Just by surviving as long as he has, Brian has accomplished something.”

Others believe things will get worse before they get better. They point to Iran’s increasingly violent regional escalation to get the US to back down. Tehran has bombed oil tankers, Saudi oil fields, and restarted critical parts of their once-shuttered nuclear program. And the country has cracked down brutally on recent widespread internal protests, despite global condemnation for its actions.

Sen. Kaine, a former Democratic vice presidential candidate, believes this is proof that the Hook-led maximum pressure campaign is failing. “Iran feels existentially provoked,” he told me. “We could easily be like the Guns of August and blunder into a war that would be foolish to be in.”

Hook’s loyalists beg to differ. “We think our pressure is bigger than their resistance, and they think the opposite,” a senior State Department official told me.

Recently, Hook’s escalation campaign against Iran’s most important resource has become even more pointed.

“I am writing with good news”

On August 26, Hook directly emailed an Indian ship captain piloting an Iranian oil tanker in international waters. “This is Brian Hook ,” he wrote to Akhilesh Kumar. “I work for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and serve as the US representative for Iran. I am writing with good news.”

Hook explained that if Kumar took the ship to a country that would impound the vessel on America’s behalf, he would receive millions of dollars in compensation through the State Department’s Rewards for Justice program, which gives up to $15 million for information desired by the US.

Kumar wasn’t special, per se: Hook has emailed or called ship captains roughly a dozen times all in an effort to stop Iran from evading US-imposed sanctions.

“Iran knows that the success of our pressure campaign depends on vigorous enforcement of oil sanctions,” Hook told the Financial Times in September. “We have collapsed Iran’s oil exports in a short period of time. We are working very closely with the maritime community to disrupt and deter illicit oil exports.”

That article and word of mouth have clearly raised awareness of Hook’s efforts. According to the State Department, the Rewards for Justice program has received over 23,000 tips on Iran during this administration, all hoping to receive some financial reward for information on Iran’s sanctions-evading practices. Specific rewards, though, are classified.

Critics of the program, mainly Iranian officials like Zarif, say the plan is nothing less than “outright blackmail.”

Hook’s supporters, though, say he’s done a superb job getting the entire diplomatic apparatus to fall in line with the maximum pressure plan. “Brian has completely turned a freighter around regarding America’s Iran policy, both literally and figuratively,” Hammond, the top official in Tillerson’s State Department, told me.

Even critics note that those accomplishments are impressive, but say the US still hasn’t done enough to crush Tehran as hoped. “They’ll survive [the economic pressure] and they’ll make it difficult” for the US, Eurasia Group Iran expert Henry Rome told me, “especially because they want to build leverage for post-2020 negotiations.” The regime may be helped in the short term by European countries working hard to maintain economic and business ties with Iran.

Iran, it seems, is prepared to wait out Trump and is showing its muscle to a future administration. Others agree: The Trump administration has “really painted themselves into a corner,” a department official told me.

In February, for example, the IAG hastily organized a two-day summit in Warsaw meant to recruit more than 60 countries to isolate Tehran as part of the maximum pressure campaign. It ended in total failure as the US isolated itself instead.

Among other embarrassments, the leaders of Germany, France, and the European Union — all members in the Iran nuclear deal — didn’t come, despite Hook’s invitation. Meanwhile, other European and Arab nations sent low-level delegates to the sessions.

That left top American officials, like Vice President Mike Pence and Pompeo, in an embarrassing position. Usually they would only attend events featuring their counterparts; in this case, they flew all the way to Poland to hobnob with foreign leaders well below their stature.

It also didn’t help that Pence gave a fiery speech, lecturing the Europeans about giving Iran money, even though the accord they still adhere to allows it. It’s “an ill-advised step that will only strengthen Iran, weaken the EU, and create still more distance between Europe and America,” Pence said. Many in the audience were stunned, officials told me.

That conference and other woes didn’t keep Hook out of the running to replace John Bolton as national security adviser in September. Two people familiar with the situation said that Kushner pushed for Hook to get the job, though he ultimately lost out.

The admiration inside the administration, however, hasn’t totally translated to Capitol Hill. During an October Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Hook testified on Trump’s decision to withdraw US troops from Syria, abandoning long-time Kurdish allies and leading to Turkey’s incursion to kill them.

Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT), who Hook supported and advised during the 2012 presidential campaign, asked him if Iran would benefit from a lack of American presence and further chaos in the region. Hook could only respond with a non-answer. “Our military is in Syria for ISIS, our diplomacy is focused on Iran,” he said, noting his work on the “pressure side” dovetails with his colleagues’ efforts to find a diplomatic solution in the country.

Romney was incredulous. “It’s astonishing that the Administration’s top Iran expert does not believe Turkey’s attacks on Kurds in Syria are a game changer in favor of Iran,” he tweeted about the exchange. “Kurds are now aligned with Assad, whose regime is backed by Iran!”

While he still has many allies on the Hill who admit to being huge Hook fans, some congressional Republicans tell me that that may have been Hook’s last official appearance in front of Congress in this administration. Between Tehran’s aggressive pushback and his role in Nowrouzzadeh’s ouster, they worry Democrats will trash him on camera. Others also admit that Hook isn’t that impressive on Iran policy even in private, which makes him expendable as far as they’re concerned.

Indeed, Hook may have climbed to the top of Mount Trump, but it’s come at the cost of getting on the wrong side of his previously like-minded Republicans. If there was ever a moment to crystalize Hook’s journey, it was his dispute with Romney: Seven years earlier, he helped Romney devise an internationalist American foreign policy. Today, he’s an emblem of the Trump administration to the world — repping a foreign policy that some say is overly brash, overly aggressive, and overly haphazard.

Whether or not he ultimately succeeds with Iran, many will forever peg him as a Trump guy. Only Hook knows whether it’s been worth it, but those who know him understand the situation he’s in.

“This has been an exceptionally difficult administration in which to serve, especially for people of quality,” Feaver, Hook’s former associate, told me. “Just by surviving as long as he has, Brian has accomplished something.”",www.vox.com,left,bpFnT4IBljDLOgmM
state_department,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/aug/22/fbi-found-14000-new-hillary-clinton-emails/,New emails disprove Clinton’s story,2016-08-22,Stephen Dinan,"The Obama administration acknowledged Monday that the FBI found at least 14,900 more email messages former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton never turned over to the government , and officials are facing intense pressure to release them ahead of November ’ s election .
A federal judge ordered the State Department to speed up the process , and the Republican National Committee said the administration should strive to release an initial set of the secret emails within a month , or when the first states conduct early voting .
The existence of the emails marks yet more trouble for Mrs. Clinton , the Democratic presidential nominee , who insisted she turned over all of her work-related messages in December 2014 .
Rep. Lamar Smith , Texas Republican and chairman of the House Science , Space and Technology Committee , issued subpoenas Monday demanding answers from three technology companies that helped set up or maintain Mrs. Clinton ’ s unique email arrangement and demanding to know what kind of security she took to prevent hacks .
Another part of Mrs. Clinton ’ s email story — that former Secretary Colin L. Powell gave her the idea of using a secret account — also crumbled after Mr. Powell disputed it . He said he sent Mrs. Clinton a memo a year after she took office , meaning she couldn ’ t have been relying on his suggestion .
“ Her people have been trying to pin it on me , ” Mr. Powell said , according to the New York Post and People magazine , who caught up with him at a social function in New York over the weekend .
Mrs. Clinton refused to use an official State Department email account during her four years in office . Instead , she conducted all of her business , including sending classified emails , from an account tied to a server she kept at her New York home . That arrangement effectively thwarted open-records laws and shielded her communications from the public for more than six years .
State Department officials said they would try to work through the newly discovered messages as quickly as possible , but their initial timeline meant the first disclosure wouldn ’ t be until the middle of October .
Judge James E. Boasberg rejected that estimate Monday and ordered a faster schedule , saying the State Department has one month to appraise the first 14,900 emails and must report back by Sept. 23 on how it will release them .
Some critics fear the Obama administration may try to slow the process and push the release of most of the messages past the November election .
“ If they wanted the records out quickly , they ’ d be out quickly . If they don ’ t want the records out quickly , they ’ ll let politics intrude on the process and the American people won ’ t see them until Election Day , ” said Tom Fitton , president of Judicial Watch , which sued to get a look at all of Mrs. Clinton ’ s emails .
State Department spokesman Mark Toner couldn ’ t explain why the nearly 15,000 messages were coming to light now , after Mrs. Clinton assured federal judges that she had turned over all of her work-related messages .
The 14,900 messages are on one disk in a set of eight that the FBI turned over to the State Department last month , after the law enforcement agency completed a yearlong probe into Mrs. Clinton ’ s emails .
Among the other seven disks are one containing what has been described as “ classified ” material and another containing the 30,000 or so messages Mrs. Clinton did turn back to the Obama administration in December 2014 . The contents of the remaining five disks are unclear , though the Obama administration says the set contains a lot of emails .
“ There are tens of thousands , ” Lisa A. Olson , a Justice Department lawyer handling the case for the State Department , told Judge Boasberg .
For now , the first disk is the focus of Judicial Watch , the State Department and the judge , because all 14,900 of its emails are among those Mrs. Clinton didn ’ t turn over . Some of them may be personal — the messages about her yoga schedule or her daughter ’ s wedding plans — that Mrs. Clinton mentioned last year .

Mr. Smith said Secnap and Datto refused to cooperate voluntarily , insisting they needed permission of their client first . Meanwhile the attorney for Platte River ducked attempts to communicate with him , Mr. Smith said .
Rep. Donald S. Beyer Jr. , a Virginia Democrat who serves on the science committee , called the subpoenas “ a wasteful use of taxpayer dollars … for blatantly partisan purposes . ”","The Obama administration acknowledged Monday that the FBI found at least 14,900 more email messages former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton never turned over to the government, and officials are facing intense pressure to release them ahead of November’s election.

A federal judge ordered the State Department to speed up the process, and the Republican National Committee said the administration should strive to release an initial set of the secret emails within a month, or when the first states conduct early voting.

The existence of the emails marks yet more trouble for Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, who insisted she turned over all of her work-related messages in December 2014.

Rep. Lamar Smith, Texas Republican and chairman of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, issued subpoenas Monday demanding answers from three technology companies that helped set up or maintain Mrs. Clinton’s unique email arrangement and demanding to know what kind of security she took to prevent hacks.

Another part of Mrs. Clinton’s email story — that former Secretary Colin L. Powell gave her the idea of using a secret account — also crumbled after Mr. Powell disputed it. He said he sent Mrs. Clinton a memo a year after she took office, meaning she couldn’t have been relying on his suggestion.

“Her people have been trying to pin it on me,” Mr. Powell said, according to the New York Post and People magazine, who caught up with him at a social function in New York over the weekend.

Mrs. Clinton refused to use an official State Department email account during her four years in office. Instead, she conducted all of her business, including sending classified emails, from an account tied to a server she kept at her New York home. That arrangement effectively thwarted open-records laws and shielded her communications from the public for more than six years.

State Department officials said they would try to work through the newly discovered messages as quickly as possible, but their initial timeline meant the first disclosure wouldn’t be until the middle of October.

Judge James E. Boasberg rejected that estimate Monday and ordered a faster schedule, saying the State Department has one month to appraise the first 14,900 emails and must report back by Sept. 23 on how it will release them.

Some critics fear the Obama administration may try to slow the process and push the release of most of the messages past the November election.

“If they wanted the records out quickly, they’d be out quickly. If they don’t want the records out quickly, they’ll let politics intrude on the process and the American people won’t see them until Election Day,” said Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, which sued to get a look at all of Mrs. Clinton’s emails.

State Department spokesman Mark Toner couldn’t explain why the nearly 15,000 messages were coming to light now, after Mrs. Clinton assured federal judges that she had turned over all of her work-related messages.

The 14,900 messages are on one disk in a set of eight that the FBI turned over to the State Department last month, after the law enforcement agency completed a yearlong probe into Mrs. Clinton’s emails.

Among the other seven disks are one containing what has been described as “classified” material and another containing the 30,000 or so messages Mrs. Clinton did turn back to the Obama administration in December 2014. The contents of the remaining five disks are unclear, though the Obama administration says the set contains a lot of emails.

“There are tens of thousands,” Lisa A. Olson, a Justice Department lawyer handling the case for the State Department, told Judge Boasberg.

For now, the first disk is the focus of Judicial Watch, the State Department and the judge, because all 14,900 of its emails are among those Mrs. Clinton didn’t turn over. Some of them may be personal — the messages about her yoga schedule or her daughter’s wedding plans — that Mrs. Clinton mentioned last year.

But FBI Director James B. Comey also has said thousands are work-related. They were obtained from Mrs. Clinton’s server and various email devices she used.

The State Department said it will finish “ingesting” all eight disks’ contents this week and then will appraise the contents. After that, it will know the total number of documents and have a general idea of what is on them, and then it must process them, redacting private or protected information and asking other agencies to weigh in on potentially classified material.

Judge Boasberg, though, said the department can work faster by focusing on the first disk’s emails. He said they will set a schedule when they meet next month.

The Republican National Committee insisted that the schedule be expedited so the first emails are released as early voting begins in the states near the end of September. It said all of the messages should be released before Election Day.

It’s unclear what sort of information will be found on the newly discovered emails or whether any of them contain classified information.

The at times heated testimony before House and Senate committees , likely to be the outgoing secretary 's last , elicited praise from Democrats and frustration from Republicans . Far from putting the issue to rest , the testimony further fueled a debate that has raged on Capitol Hill for four months .
Though she said officials are following some `` very promising leads '' on the terrorists , Clinton herself acknowledged there are still several open questions about what prompted the attack that night .
The secretary battled tough criticism from lawmakers throughout the day . In one of the final jabs of the session , Rep. Jeff Duncan , R-S.C. , told her , `` Madame Secretary , you let the consulate become a death trap . ''
Republican Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson claimed the department could have `` easily '' determined what happened that night by interviewing staffers who were evacuated . He was referring to the administration 's initial claim that the attack sprung out of a protest . It was later determined there was no protest on the ground in Benghazi . Diplomatic security agents said as much to the FBI during interviews on Sept. 14 , despite administration claims to the contrary two days later .
`` We were misled that there were supposedly protests and something sprang out of that , '' Johnson said . `` The American people could have known that ( there was no protest ) within days , and they did n't know that . ''
`` With all due respect , the fact is we had four dead Americans , '' she said .
Clinton continued to speak , raising her voice and gesturing : `` Was it because of a protest or is it because of guys out for a walk one night and they decide they go kill some Americans ?
Clinton , lowering her voice , then said it is the administration 's job to `` figure out what happened '' and prevent it from happening again .
Later in the testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , Clinton acknowledged the administration did not have a `` clear picture '' of what happened in the immediate aftermath . She said perhaps officials did n't do a good enough job explaining that they `` did n't have a clear picture . ''
But Clinton still said the motivations of the attackers , to this day , are not clear . `` Even today there are questions being raised , '' she said , referring to findings in the classified version of a recent report that she could not describe in detail .
Clinton , throughout the hearing , walked a fine line between taking responsibility generally for what went wrong and challenging specific allegations against her department and the administration .
During the opening of the hearing , Clinton said she has `` no higher priority '' than the security of her department 's staff , and that she is committed to making the department `` safer , stronger and more secure . ''
`` As I have said many times , I take responsibility , and nobody is more committed to getting this right , '' Clinton said , later choking up when describing how she greeted the families of the victims when the caskets were returned .
Clinton went on to deny having ever seen the requests for more security from the Libya team that were denied by officials within the State Department .
`` I did n't see those requests , they did n't come to me , '' Clinton said , adding those kinds of requests would n't normally come to the secretary .
Sen. Rand Paul , R-Ky. , later suggested lives could have been saved if Clinton were more involved in reviewing security requests .
He said that if he were president , `` I would have relieved you from your post . ''
Sen. John McCain , R-Ariz. , after the exchange with Johnson , said he was not satisfied with the secretary 's answers , complaining that the public still does n't have answers on what happened .
Clinton , while pushing back against Johnson , also said she was not involved in crafting the controversial statements that U.S . Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice made on Sept. 16 -- in which she asserted the attack was `` spontaneous '' and linked to a protest .
`` I was n't involved in the talking points process , '' Clinton said , though she said she was n't aware of anything that would have `` contradicted '' the information Rice had at the time . She noted that `` going on the Sunday shows is not my favorite thing , '' a possible reference to claims that she declined to go on television Sept. 16 .
Clinton also defended the administration 's actions on the night of Sept. 11 , when the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi came under fire and four Americans died .
`` I directed our response from the State Department and stayed in close contact with officials from across our government and the Libyan government , '' she said . `` No delays in decision-making . No denials of support from Washington or from our military . ''
Citing the findings of a review panel , she said : `` The board said the response saved American lives in real time -- and it did . ''
Several accounts relayed to Fox News , though , suggest possible delays in the response .
Fox News has learned from senior U.S. defense officials that a FAST team of Marines out of Spain was asked by State Department officials to change out of their Marine uniforms after being asked to leave for Libya to help -- this required them to deplane and delayed them by about 90 minutes , according to Pentagon officials .
Then there is the decision by Clinton and State Department Undersecretary of Management Patrick Kennedy not to mobilize the Counterterrorism Security Group , which is composed of experts on terrorism from across government agencies and makes recommendations on the response to crises involving terrorism .
Further , there are questions about the perceived delays CIA officials -- stationed in Benghazi -- encountered that night and their frustration that air support was not sent from nearby Sigonella air base . In recent weeks , Fox News has learned that the rescue unit that left Tripoli was told that air support would be above when they landed in Benghazi . It was n't .
During the hearing on the House side Wednesday afternoon , Clinton was also pressed on why she was never interviewed by the State Department-sponsored board that investigated the incident . Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen , R-Fla. , said that was `` outrageous . ''
Clinton said the board thought she was not `` relevant '' to their investigation because they were focusing on security officials . She said she `` gladly '' would have spoken with them .
She also addressed concerns about the four State Department officials who were removed from their jobs in the fallout from the attack - but were not removed from the department . She suggested federal law restricts what disciplinary measures could be taken against them .
The hearing Wednesday comes amid a broadening threat to U.S. interests across North Africa . There are reports that some of the attackers who took hostages in the deadly raid on an Algeria gas plant may have also participated in the Libya attack .
`` Benghazi did not happen in a vacuum , '' Clinton said Wednesday , while saying later she could not verify that specific claim . She said instability has created an `` expanding safe haven for terrorists '' who plot into Algeria and other countries .
Sen. Bob Corker , R-Tenn. , top Republican on the Senate committee , lamented `` the spiking of the ball and the thinking that when Usama bin Laden was gone that was the end of Al Qaeda . ''

state_department,Christian Science Monitor,1,http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2016/1213/In-Moscow-Trump-s-tapping-of-Tillerson-lifts-hope-of-US-rapprochement,"In Moscow, Trump's tapping of Tillerson lifts hope of US rapprochement",2016-12-13,Fred Weir,"It ’ s a rarity for Moscow to be enthusiastic over a US president 's choice for secretary of State . It certainly wasn ’ t the case for either of the past two secretaries , Hillary Clinton and John Kerry .
So Donald Trump 's decision Tuesday to nominate ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson is proving to be a pleasant surprise to Russia .
Even more than the election of Mr. Trump , which brought Russia 's State Duma to its feet in a standing ovation , the nomination of Mr. Tillerson seems evidence to Russians close to the Kremlin that the new administration will move seriously to implement Mr. Trump 's sketchy campaign promises about restoring good relations .
Tillerson is well known and liked in Moscow , where he has been doing business for almost 20 years , but he is also seen as a completely different type than the US diplomats the Russians have regularly dealt with . `` Tillerson as Secretary of State would signify the greatest discontinuity in US foreign policy since the end of the Cold War , '' tweeted Dmitry Trenin , head of the Moscow Carnegie Center , before the announcement .
Sergei Karaganov , one of Russia 's most senior foreign policy hands , says the difference is that Tillerson is a hard-nosed pragmatist who will focus on getting things done , and leave aside the many political and philosophical issues where Russia and the US will never agree . Like many in Moscow 's upper circles , Mr. Karaganov has met Tillerson and says that his ratification would be a signal that genuine and lasting detente between the two powers is a real possibility .
`` We know him , and that 's good . But it 's mainly what we know about him , which is that he 's a realist who is not driven by ideology , '' he says . `` If the Trump administration survives , and takes hold , I for one will start to believe that we can re-align this relationship in ways that will stress areas of concord and cooperation , and find ways to manage the differences . ''
Tillerson took charge of Exxon 's operations in Russia in 1998 , and navigated the company through major difficulties after Vladimir Putin came to power and the Kremlin demanded that earlier oil-and-gas deals be revised in favor of Russia 's state energy giants Gazprom and Rosneft . In 2011 , as Exxon CEO , he negotiated a long-range , multi-billion dollar joint venture with Rosneft to explore for oil in Russia 's Arctic .
Mr. Putin , who has met frequently with Tillerson , awarded him the highest honor Russia can bestow on a foreigner , The Order of Friendship , in 2013 .
The imposition of sanctions by the US in punishment for Russia 's annexation of Crimea forced the mothballing of the Arctic project , and Exxon reportedly lost $ 1 billion as a result . Tillerson has since lobbied hard against the sanctions , a fact that could present a problem for him in Senate hearings .
`` I know that the Washington establishment will throw everything at Tillerson , especially his supposed 'friendship ' with Putin , '' says Karaganov . `` But I can not imagine a person in his position being corruptible , either by ideology or money .

`` It seems to me there are a lot of illusions on both sides .

''
`` Putin knows what he wants , '' Mr. Konovalov says , `` but I 'm not sure Trump has a very clear idea how to handle Russia . ''","It’s a rarity for Moscow to be enthusiastic over a US president's choice for secretary of State. It certainly wasn’t the case for either of the past two secretaries, Hillary Clinton and John Kerry.

So Donald Trump's decision Tuesday to nominate ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson is proving to be a pleasant surprise to Russia.

Even more than the election of Mr. Trump, which brought Russia's State Duma to its feet in a standing ovation, the nomination of Mr. Tillerson seems evidence to Russians close to the Kremlin that the new administration will move seriously to implement Mr. Trump's sketchy campaign promises about restoring good relations.

Tillerson is well known and liked in Moscow, where he has been doing business for almost 20 years, but he is also seen as a completely different type than the US diplomats the Russians have regularly dealt with. ""Tillerson as Secretary of State would signify the greatest discontinuity in US foreign policy since the end of the Cold War,"" tweeted Dmitry Trenin, head of the Moscow Carnegie Center, before the announcement.

Sergei Karaganov, one of Russia's most senior foreign policy hands, says the difference is that Tillerson is a hard-nosed pragmatist who will focus on getting things done, and leave aside the many political and philosophical issues where Russia and the US will never agree. Like many in Moscow's upper circles, Mr. Karaganov has met Tillerson and says that his ratification would be a signal that genuine and lasting detente between the two powers is a real possibility.

""We know him, and that's good. But it's mainly what we know about him, which is that he's a realist who is not driven by ideology,"" he says. ""If the Trump administration survives, and takes hold, I for one will start to believe that we can re-align this relationship in ways that will stress areas of concord and cooperation, and find ways to manage the differences.""

Tillerson took charge of Exxon's operations in Russia in 1998, and navigated the company through major difficulties after Vladimir Putin came to power and the Kremlin demanded that earlier oil-and-gas deals be revised in favor of Russia's state energy giants Gazprom and Rosneft. In 2011, as Exxon CEO, he negotiated a long-range, multi-billion dollar joint venture with Rosneft to explore for oil in Russia's Arctic.

Mr. Putin, who has met frequently with Tillerson, awarded him the highest honor Russia can bestow on a foreigner, The Order of Friendship, in 2013.

The imposition of sanctions by the US in punishment for Russia's annexation of Crimea forced the mothballing of the Arctic project, and Exxon reportedly lost $1 billion as a result. Tillerson has since lobbied hard against the sanctions, a fact that could present a problem for him in Senate hearings.

""I know that the Washington establishment will throw everything at Tillerson, especially his supposed 'friendship' with Putin,"" says Karaganov. ""But I cannot imagine a person in his position being corruptible, either by ideology or money. We knew him as a tough negotiator, who was a great patriot of his company. We assume he'll be a patriot of the US. This is actually what Russian leaders want, a man sitting across the table who will drive a hard but viable and lasting bargain.""

Sergei Markov, a past adviser to Putin, says the whole foreign policy team that Trump is assembling makes it look like a break with past practices may be imminent.

""We see Gen. [James] Mattis being named to be Defense secretary, and that looks to us like someone who could steer military cooperation between the US and Russia away from constantly obstructing each other and toward cooperation to defeat terrorism. Michael Flynn, who's going to be White House national security adviser, is a person who advocates clear-eyed cooperation with Russia in areas that matter to both of us,"" Mr. Markov says. ""We don't imagine these people are special friends of ours, or anything like that, but it will be very refreshing to have diplomatic counterparts who are interested in practical deal-making.

""Our experience over the past decade and a half is that we don't have negotiations in any real sense, we just get lectures and ultimatums from our US counterparts,"" Markov adds. ""Even where there was a bit of substantive discussion lately, over Syria, the US position kept changing and nothing was accomplished.""

But some Russian experts are more skeptical.

The Obama administration claimed the agreement was made to settle a dispute with Iran over $ 400 million in frozen funds that dated back to 1979 .

state_department,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/24/islamist-terror-groups-target-minnesota-somali-ref/,"Feds’ relocation of Somali refugees stresses Minn. welfare, raises terror fears",2015-02-24,Kelly Riddell,"The State Department has helped to relocate tens of thousands of refugees from the war-torn African nation of Somalia to Minnesota , where they can take advantage of some of America ’ s most generous welfare and charity programs .
But the effort is having the unintended consequence of creating an enclave of immigrants with high unemployment that is both stressing the state ’ s safety net and creating a rich pool of potential recruiting targets for Islamist terror groups .
In the fiscal year that ended in September , Minnesota welcomed 1,118 Somali refugees arriving directly from Africa , most of them without family ties to the state , according to State Department statistics . Overall , more than 30,000 Somalis live in the midwestern state comprising the nation ’ s largest concentration of Somali immigrants , according to U.S. Census data .
Many of the refugees settle near the Twin Cities , with Minneapolis being dubbed “ Little Mogadishu ” after the capital of Somalia .
This population is also being targeted by Islamist terror organizations like the Islamic State and al-Shabab , a Somalia-based group with links to al Qaeda , according to U.S. officials .
Among Minnesota-based Somali-Americans , American converts to Islam or Somali refugees , there have been numerous convictions for various levels of collaboration with Islamist terror groups , plus reports of fighting with al-Shabab or other Islamist groups .
On Sunday , al-Shabab made a propaganda video warning of an attack on shopping malls around the world , including the Mall of America in Minnesota . Al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the terror attack on the Westgate shopping mall in Kenya two years ago , which left 67 dead .
“ We have definitely seen targeted terror recruitment videos , videos aimed and targeted directly at the youth here in Minnesota primarily within the Somali community , ” said Kyle Loven , an FBI spokesman in Minneapolis . “ They ’ re going after disaffected youth — those who are isolated . We can ’ t get into specifics , but we ’ ve been involved in major investigations since 2007 and continue to be . ”
Most of Minnesota ’ s Somali population started off as legal refugees through a program administered by the U.S. State Department through the Bureau of Population , Refugees , and Migration .
Minnesota was selected among the nation ’ s states for relocation primarily because of its robust entitlement offerings and the number of charitable organizations operating within the state with which the State Department contracts .
“ Minnesota is exceptional in many ways but it ’ s the closest thing in the United States to a true social democratic state , ” said Ahmed Samatar , a professor of international studies at Macalester College , in St. Paul .
“ That translates into the way Somali refugees have been received here they ’ ve been given a secure environment , housing , education , health care , perhaps even some minimum income to sustain them until they can stand on their own feet . That ’ s all provided by Minnesota , ” said Mr. Samatar , who has tracked the State Department ’ s refugee program .
Outside Alaska , Minnesota spends more per low-income person on public welfare than any other state in the U.S. , according to a report by the Center for the American Experiment , a think tank located in Minneapolis . The report found Minnesota outspent its average peer state in welfare subsidies by nearly $ 4,000 .
In addition to its generous welfare subsidies , Minnesota also has a number of charitable organizations that contract with the State Department like Lutheran Social Services , Catholic Charities , and World Relief Minnesota . Those organizations agree to help the Somali refugees learn English , get health care , find housing and gradually learn to adopt the U.S. as home .
The State Department didn ’ t specifically say why Minnesota was selected early in its Somali refugee relocation program only that : “ Resettlement locations are chosen for a variety of factors , including communities where a refugee has a family or social tie , where the local resettlement agency has the requisite language skills and social services , and where jobs are available so that refugees can begin the transition to self-sufficiency , ” said Larry Bartlett , the U.S . Refugee Admissions program director , in a statement to the ███ .
Even though Minnesota has a good job market , that doesn ’ t seem to have translated into jobs for the Somali refugees . Minnesota ’ s state demographer ’ s office reports that only 41 percent of Somali men are working and 54 percent of Somali women are employed , meaning many may rely on the state ’ s handouts to survive , and are more susceptible to extremists pull .
“ It seems safe to assume that if they ’ re not working , then they ’ re likely receiving public welfare benefits , ” said Peter Nelson , director of public policy at the Center of the American Experiment . “ More problematic , the Somali men not working are clearly not integrating as well as they could with society , which could feed into them being radicalized and recruited to fight with ” the Islamic State .
Minnesota started seeing Somali refugees gather in their state in the early 1990s , after the Somali civil war led millions to flee to refugee camps , mainly in neighoring Kenya , which also has a refugee camp dubbed “ Little Mogadishu ” near its capital of Nairobi .
The U.N. worked with the State Department to get the refugees placed , who in turn teamed with the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Health and Human Services , to make the final decision .
Today , in addition to being assigned the state , more Somalis are arriving to Minnesota after briefly being relocated to other states , as most want to live where an established Somali community is , regardless of Minnesota ’ s harsh weather or landlocked location .
Other large Somali populations reside in Maine , around the Seattle region and in Columbus , Ohio .
“ Minnesota has a very large and relatively new Somali community . So you have first generation Somali youth who are torn because they haven ’ t experienced the best of America yet and still have feelings for their country , ” said Oren Segal , director of ADL ’ s Center on Extremism . “ And so they ’ re ripe for online terrorist recruiters , who say ‘ Come and fight for your homeland , something you believe in , ’ because they haven ’ t assimilated to America yet . ”
Indeed , the FBI has noticed a steady stream of Islamist-recruitment videos specifically targeted at Minnesota ’ s Somali population , said the FBI ’ s Mr. Loven .
“ What the FBI in Minneapolis has done with the U.S. Attorney is we have established strong liaison program within the Somali community , to seek out and work with concerned civic organizations and people who have a general uneasiness that their population has been targeted , ” Mr. Loven said . “ The videos and the online messaging is clearly targeting youths from within the Somali community and it ’ s a challenge for law enforcement to determine who will be moved to action with these videos . ”
Since 2008 , as many as 40 men from Minneapolis have joined Islamist groups after being pulled in by jihadists through social media , federal officials say .
Last year , an American youth named Douglas McAuthur McCain died in Syria fighting for the Islamic State . Mr. McCain was recruited in Minnesota , where he lived .
In 2009 , another Minnesota youth , Troy Kastigar posted a recruiting video for al-Shabab before he was killed fighting for the terrorist group in Somalia . Kastigar and McCain are thought to have been friends .
That same year a Somali man who left Minneapolis joined al-Shabab and blew himself up in a suicide bombing at an Ethiopian consulate in Somalia , killing 24 people .
In an effort to better assimilate their refugee population — and deter against Islamist recruitment efforts — Gov . Mark Dayton has expanded the state ’ s entitlement programs , although he remains mum on the state ’ s expense at doing so .
“ The state of Minnesota receives funding through the federal Department of Health and Human Services , Office of Refugee Resettlement to promote the successful resettlement and integration of refugees in Minnesota , ” said a spokeswoman at the state ’ s Department of Human Services . “ The Refugee Programs Office of the Minnesota Department of Human Services administers these federal funds to partner with diverse community-based agencies around the state to provide various services to refugees who are fewer than five years in the country . Programming includes social services , employment services , services for the elderly and after-school programs for youth . ”
However , issues come up on the political tightrope of welcoming refugees into the state along with supporting U.S. counter-terror measures and building a civic society in Somalia , which has collapsed into a regional clan society with a barely existing government over the past 20-odd years .
Fro example , Merchants Bank halted money transfers to Somalia this month in the wake of a cease-and-desist order issued by the U.S. Treasury Department ’ s Office of the Comptroller of Currency .
The U.S. Treasury was worried Merchants could not adequately prove all the money being wired from the U.S. was going to legitimate sources abroad , and not to jihadist groups .
Sens . Amy Klobuchar and Al Franken , both Democrats , sent a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry seeking a meeting to craft an “ emergency plan ” that would address the shortage of reliable money transfer services that Somalis can use to send money to their homeland , as the move caused an uproar in Minnesota .
“ There were actually 20 indictments against people participating in al-Shabaab , already nine convictions over the past two years , and some recent indictments involving those recruited to go fight with ” the Islamic State , said Ms. Klobuchar in a statement responding to the Mall of America threat .
“ So we know this is a real problem in our community . But the Somalis in our community , they are serving in elected office , they are running businesses . They are part of a fabric of life in the community and also part of the solution , ” she said .
In addition to law-enforcement reaching out to the Somali community to build terror leads , Minnesotans have also welcomed them onto their entitlement rolls , with the state ’ s cash assistance and food stamp programs , skyrocketing in recent years .
The number of Somali adults and children who participated in the Minnesota ’ s family cash assistance program jumped 34 percent from 2008 to 2013 , according to the state ’ s statistics . Likewise , Minnesota ’ s food assistance participation increased 98 percent , to 17,300 adults and children , which does not include U.S.-born Somalis , in the same timeframe .
Last year , due to the influx of Somali youths , the Minneapolis School District started its NABAD program — an acronym that means “ peace ” in Somali — aimed at helping Somali children better assimilate to the U.S. educational system .
The program , which was expanded to eight classrooms last year , teaches English , provides a Somali-speaking classroom aide and is required for a year before the children join a regular classroom setting .
And the state is doing more to enroll more Somali immigrants into its Obamacare health exchanges , dubbed MNsure . Many Minnesota residents who aren ’ t covered but want health insurance are parents , women and Somali immigrants aware of universal health care in their native country , according to MNsure research .
Overall , the number of Somalis resettled in the state has more than tripled in four years , according to State Department statistics . And with the surge in refugees comes more of a risk to the community , radicalization experts say .
“ The issue of young Somali ’ s being brought into these terror organizations is huge — but I think one thing that is often ignored is a lot of young Americans who are not in the Somali community are also responding to these specific calls , ” said ADL ’ s Mr. Segal . “ The community in Minnesota has particularly been hit — some have no doubt been brainwashed by the propaganda targeted at them . ”","The State Department has helped to relocate tens of thousands of refugees from the war-torn African nation of Somalia to Minnesota, where they can take advantage of some of America’s most generous welfare and charity programs.

“Minnesota is exceptional in many ways but it’s the closest thing in the United States to a true social democratic state,” said Ahmed Samatar, a professor of international studies at Macalester College, in St. Paul.

“That translates into the way Somali refugees have been received here they’ve been given a secure environment, housing, education, health care, perhaps even some minimum income to sustain them until they can stand on their own feet. That’s all provided by Minnesota,” said Mr. Samatar, who has tracked the State Department’s refugee program.

Outside Alaska, Minnesota spends more per low-income person on public welfare than any other state in the U.S., according to a report by the Center for the American Experiment, a think tank located in Minneapolis. The report found Minnesota outspent its average peer state in welfare subsidies by nearly $4,000.

In addition to its generous welfare subsidies, Minnesota also has a number of charitable organizations that contract with the State Department like Lutheran Social Services, Catholic Charities, and World Relief Minnesota. Those organizations agree to help the Somali refugees learn English, get health care, find housing and gradually learn to adopt the U.S. as home.

The State Department didn’t specifically say why Minnesota was selected early in its Somali refugee relocation program only that: “Resettlement locations are chosen for a variety of factors, including communities where a refugee has a family or social tie, where the local resettlement agency has the requisite language skills and social services, and where jobs are available so that refugees can begin the transition to self-sufficiency,” said Larry Bartlett, the U.S. Refugee Admissions program director, in a statement to the Washington Times.

Even though Minnesota has a good job market, that doesn’t seem to have translated into jobs for the Somali refugees. Minnesota’s state demographer’s office reports that only 41 percent of Somali men are working and 54 percent of Somali women are employed, meaning many may rely on the state’s handouts to survive, and are more susceptible to extremists pull.

“It seems safe to assume that if they’re not working, then they’re likely receiving public welfare benefits,” said Peter Nelson, director of public policy at the Center of the American Experiment. “More problematic, the Somali men not working are clearly not integrating as well as they could with society, which could feed into them being radicalized and recruited to fight with” the Islamic State.

Minnesota started seeing Somali refugees gather in their state in the early 1990s, after the Somali civil war led millions to flee to refugee camps, mainly in neighoring Kenya, which also has a refugee camp dubbed “Little Mogadishu” near its capital of Nairobi.

The U.N. worked with the State Department to get the refugees placed, who in turn teamed with the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Health and Human Services, to make the final decision.

Today, in addition to being assigned the state, more Somalis are arriving to Minnesota after briefly being relocated to other states, as most want to live where an established Somali community is, regardless of Minnesota’s harsh weather or landlocked location.

Other large Somali populations reside in Maine, around the Seattle region and in Columbus, Ohio.

“Minnesota has a very large and relatively new Somali community. So you have first generation Somali youth who are torn because they haven’t experienced the best of America yet and still have feelings for their country,” said Oren Segal, director of ADL’s Center on Extremism. “And so they’re ripe for online terrorist recruiters, who say ‘Come and fight for your homeland, something you believe in,’ because they haven’t assimilated to America yet.”

Indeed, the FBI has noticed a steady stream of Islamist-recruitment videos specifically targeted at Minnesota’s Somali population, said the FBI’s Mr. Loven.

“What the FBI in Minneapolis has done with the U.S. Attorney is we have established strong liaison program within the Somali community, to seek out and work with concerned civic organizations and people who have a general uneasiness that their population has been targeted,” Mr. Loven said. “The videos and the online messaging is clearly targeting youths from within the Somali community and it’s a challenge for law enforcement to determine who will be moved to action with these videos.”

Since 2008, as many as 40 men from Minneapolis have joined Islamist groups after being pulled in by jihadists through social media, federal officials say.

Last year, an American youth named Douglas McAuthur McCain died in Syria fighting for the Islamic State. Mr. McCain was recruited in Minnesota, where he lived.

In 2009, another Minnesota youth, Troy Kastigar posted a recruiting video for al-Shabab before he was killed fighting for the terrorist group in Somalia. Kastigar and McCain are thought to have been friends.

That same year a Somali man who left Minneapolis joined al-Shabab and blew himself up in a suicide bombing at an Ethiopian consulate in Somalia, killing 24 people.

In an effort to better assimilate their refugee population — and deter against Islamist recruitment efforts — Gov. Mark Dayton has expanded the state’s entitlement programs, although he remains mum on the state’s expense at doing so.

“The state of Minnesota receives funding through the federal Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Refugee Resettlement to promote the successful resettlement and integration of refugees in Minnesota,” said a spokeswoman at the state’s Department of Human Services. “The Refugee Programs Office of the Minnesota Department of Human Services administers these federal funds to partner with diverse community-based agencies around the state to provide various services to refugees who are fewer than five years in the country. Programming includes social services, employment services, services for the elderly and after-school programs for youth.”

However, issues come up on the political tightrope of welcoming refugees into the state along with supporting U.S. counter-terror measures and building a civic society in Somalia, which has collapsed into a regional clan society with a barely existing government over the past 20-odd years.

Fro example, Merchants Bank halted money transfers to Somalia this month in the wake of a cease-and-desist order issued by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of the Comptroller of Currency.

The U.S. Treasury was worried Merchants could not adequately prove all the money being wired from the U.S. was going to legitimate sources abroad, and not to jihadist groups.

Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Al Franken, both Democrats, sent a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry seeking a meeting to craft an “emergency plan” that would address the shortage of reliable money transfer services that Somalis can use to send money to their homeland, as the move caused an uproar in Minnesota.

“There were actually 20 indictments against people participating in al-Shabaab, already nine convictions over the past two years, and some recent indictments involving those recruited to go fight with” the Islamic State, said Ms. Klobuchar in a statement responding to the Mall of America threat.

“So we know this is a real problem in our community. But the Somalis in our community, they are serving in elected office, they are running businesses. They are part of a fabric of life in the community and also part of the solution,” she said.

In addition to law-enforcement reaching out to the Somali community to build terror leads, Minnesotans have also welcomed them onto their entitlement rolls, with the state’s cash assistance and food stamp programs, skyrocketing in recent years.

The number of Somali adults and children who participated in the Minnesota’s family cash assistance program jumped 34 percent from 2008 to 2013, according to the state’s statistics. Likewise, Minnesota’s food assistance participation increased 98 percent, to 17,300 adults and children, which does not include U.S.-born Somalis, in the same timeframe.

Last year, due to the influx of Somali youths, the Minneapolis School District started its NABAD program — an acronym that means “peace” in Somali — aimed at helping Somali children better assimilate to the U.S. educational system.

The program, which was expanded to eight classrooms last year, teaches English, provides a Somali-speaking classroom aide and is required for a year before the children join a regular classroom setting.

And the state is doing more to enroll more Somali immigrants into its Obamacare health exchanges, dubbed MNsure. Many Minnesota residents who aren’t covered but want health insurance are parents, women and Somali immigrants aware of universal health care in their native country, according to MNsure research.

Overall, the number of Somalis resettled in the state has more than tripled in four years, according to State Department statistics. And with the surge in refugees comes more of a risk to the community, radicalization experts say.

“The issue of young Somali’s being brought into these terror organizations is huge — but I think one thing that is often ignored is a lot of young Americans who are not in the Somali community are also responding to these specific calls,” said ADL’s Mr. Segal. “The community in Minnesota has particularly been hit — some have no doubt been brainwashed by the propaganda targeted at them.”

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton engaged in six hours of sometimes aggressive questioning from both sides of Capitol Hill on Wednesday over the deaths of four Americans in the attack on U.S. diplomatic outposts in Benghazi, Libya.

Clinton — whose testimony was delayed for more than a month because of health reasons — stood her ground in a tenser hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in the morning and wasn’t rattled in an afternoon outing before the GOP-controlled House Foreign Affairs Committee, where boosterism ran high over a possible 2016 presidential bid.

On both sides of the Capitol, she accepted personal blame for the security lapses that led to the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, resulting in the death of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, among others.

“As I have said many times since Sept. 11, I take responsibility. Nobody is more committed to getting this right. I am determined to leave the State Department and our country safer, stronger and more secure,” Clinton said.

Clinton was visibly emotional during the Senate hearing, especially when she talked about the deaths of Stevens, Foreign Service information officer Sean Smith, and two members of Embassy security personnel, Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods.

“For me, this is not just a matter of policy … it’s personal,” she said. “I stood next to President [Barack] Obama as the Marines carried those flag-draped caskets off the plane at Andrews. I put my arms around the mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, sons and daughters.”

This is likely Clinton’s last high-profile testimony as secretary before a congressional committee, though she will appear on the Hill Thursday to introduce Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.), who has been nominated to succeed her at Foggy Bottom.

One of the tensest exchanges came before the Senate committee under questioning by Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who asked why evacuees from Benghazi were not immediately questioned about the cause of the attack.

“A very simple phone call to these individuals would have ascertained very quickly there was no protest,” he said, charging Americans were misled by administration talking points.

What difference, at this point, does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, Senator.”

It isn ’ t pretty .
On Thursday , a pair of devastating articles in Politico and the Washington Post described how the former Exxon Mobil CEO has been cut out of the loop on major foreign policy shifts , slapped down by the White House on personnel choices , and given virtually no opportunities to make public appearances with President Trump . Per the Post :
The Trump administration in its first month has largely benched the State Department from its long-standing role as the pre­eminent voice of U.S. foreign policy , curtailing public engagement and official travel and relegating Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to a mostly offstage role .
The day-to-day chaos of the Trump White House and mini controversies the new president regularly stirs up on Twitter make it difficult to track what ’ s going on in individual parts of the government , even ones as important as the State Department . And that ’ s why understanding what Tillerson has — and has not — been able to do is so important .
Here ’ s one thing Tillerson hasn ’ t been able to do : choose his own deputy . Tillerson , who has never worked in government , wanted State Department veteran and longtime Republican foreign policy hand Elliott Abrams . Trump personally rejected Abrams after learning that the former Bush administration official had criticized him during the campaign . Tillerson hasn ’ t found a replacement , and it ’ s not clear if , or when , he ’ ll be able to fill the post .
“ The Elliott Abrams example is pretty horrifying , ” Eliot Cohen , a top to aide to former Republican Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , told the Post .
Tillerson also doesn ’ t seem to be much of a player on key foreign policy decisions , even though the job of the secretary of state normally is to help make them . Politico has this eye-opening anecdote :

It isn’t pretty.

On Thursday, a pair of devastating articles in Politico and the Washington Post described how the former Exxon Mobil CEO has been cut out of the loop on major foreign policy shifts, slapped down by the White House on personnel choices, and given virtually no opportunities to make public appearances with President Trump. Per the Post:

The Trump administration in its first month has largely benched the State Department from its long-standing role as the pre­eminent voice of U.S. foreign policy, curtailing public engagement and official travel and relegating Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to a mostly offstage role.

The day-to-day chaos of the Trump White House and mini controversies the new president regularly stirs up on Twitter make it difficult to track what’s going on in individual parts of the government, even ones as important as the State Department. And that’s why understanding what Tillerson has — and has not — been able to do is so important.

Here’s one thing Tillerson hasn’t been able to do: choose his own deputy. Tillerson, who has never worked in government, wanted State Department veteran and longtime Republican foreign policy hand Elliott Abrams. Trump personally rejected Abrams after learning that the former Bush administration official had criticized him during the campaign. Tillerson hasn’t found a replacement, and it’s not clear if, or when, he’ll be able to fill the post.

“The Elliott Abrams example is pretty horrifying,” Eliot Cohen, a top to aide to former Republican Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, told the Post.

Tillerson also doesn’t seem to be much of a player on key foreign policy decisions, even though the job of the secretary of state normally is to help make them. Politico has this eye-opening anecdote:

Sources have told POLITICO that the secretary of state was never consulted when Trump, in an appearance with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, dropped the U.S. commitment to a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians.

That suggests, to put it diplomatically, that Tillerson doesn’t have remotely the same power as high-profile predecessors such as Rice, Hillary Clinton, and John Kerry.

America’s top diplomat has been largely silent and invisible

In a normal administration, the secretary of state is also usually the one to explain new foreign policy moves to both the press and key foreign leaders. That’s not happening, either. Tillerson has yet to meet with reporters covering the State Department, and the daily press conferences the department has held since the 1950s haven’t taken place for more than a month.

Even when Tillerson does talk with foreign leaders (and he’s apparently talked to dozens of them), the administration refuses to say much of anything about what was said. Take this, from the Post:

(CNN) – The decision to close a broad swath of American embassies and diplomatic posts across the Middle East in response to a terror threat was not an overreaction, President Barack Obama said Tuesday in his first remarks on the new security precautions.

The U.S. security posture throughout the Middle East, and especially in Yemen, was heightened after officials intercepted a message from al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri to a top ally in Yemen telling him to ""do something."" A worldwide travel alert was issued, along with the slate of embassy and consulate closings.





The latest threat, Obama said, was a reminder that violent extremism still exists in the world. He stressed the importance of using caution and common sense while traveling abroad.

""The odds of dying in a terrorist attack are a lot lower than they are of dying in a car accident, unfortunately,"" Obama said.

The president spoke on NBC's ""Tonight Show"" with Jay Leno, which was taped in California and was to air later Tuesday evening. General notes about Obama's remarks were distributed by a pool of journalists traveling with the president.

Asked about Edward Snowden, who admitted to leaking details of U.S. classified surveillance programs, Obama said he was disappointed Russia had granted asylum to the former government contractor.

Russia's leaders, he said, have a proclivity for slipping into a Cold War mindset; though he added essential cooperation between the two nations continues.

The president will still attend September's Group of 20 summit in St. Petersburg, Russia, Obama said, though the White House has said an earlier meeting in Moscow between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Obama is under review.

Discussing Russia, Obama criticized a new law in the country barring public discussion of gay rights and relationships anywhere where children might hear it. The law has been condemned by Russian and international rights groups as highly discriminatory.

President Obama: “No patience” for anti-LGBT laws in Russia

While Obama predicted Russia's treatment of gays and lesbians would not ultimately adversely affect its ability to host the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, he did say he had little tolerance for nations who intimidate or harm citizens based on their sexual orientation.

Russia, he said, has a big stake in making next year's games successful – and a crackdown on gays and lesbians would prevent a successful Olympics.

On a pair of fellow politicians - and fellow 2008 candidates for president - Obama offered laughing assessments of Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

The budding ""bromance"" between Obama and McCain - manifested Tuesday in the Republican senator's trip to Egypt at Obama's request - is akin to a romantic comedy, the president said.

""Initially, you're not getting along and then you keep bumping into each other,"" he joked.

In his opening monologue, Leno joked that McCain had been working with Egyptian leaders since ""the King Tut administration.""

And Clinton - enjoying a ""post-administration glow"" at their White House lunch last week - doesn't need to scope out the Oval Office ahead of an anticipated 2016 presidential bid. When Leno joked the former first lady may be measuring the drapes, Obama pointed out she has plenty of experience in the executive mansion.

state_department,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/29/hillary-clinton-aide-huma-abedin-paid-by-firm-to-s/,"Hillary Clinton aide, Huma Abedin, paid by firm to stage event with Bill Clinton while at State",2015-09-29,"Kelly Riddell, John Solomon","While still working at the State Department , Hillary Rodham Clinton confidante Huma Abedin was paid by the private consulting firm Teneo Holdings to help stage a star-studded reception that included her boss ’ husband , Bill Clinton , along with George W. Bush and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair as speakers just days after the Benghazi tragedy , The ███ has learned .
Ms. Abedin ’ s work on the Sept. 20 , 2012 , event at the glamorous Essex House in New York City , helped entertain potential Teneo clients , wowing them with access to three former world leaders on a single stage .
It was one of the specific projects she worked on with Teneo during a seven-month period in which she earned a $ 15,000-a-month consulting fee from the firm while simultaneously receiving pay as a “ special government employee ” advising Mrs. Clinton at the State Department , according to interviews and documents .
Ms. Abedin , the wife of former Rep. Anthony D. Weiner of New York , worked as a full-time government employee and deputy chief of staff to Secretary of State Clinton from 2009 through mid-2012 . She then moved to New York and transitioned to a part-time employee at State after giving birth to her first child and seeing her husband resign his congressional seat because of a sexting scandal .
The special government employee status at the State Department allowed Ms. Abedin to simultaneously take on other consulting work , as with Teneo and the Clinton Foundation , where she assessed the charity ’ s ongoing programs to pave the way for Mrs. Clinton ’ s return there after she left the State Department in early 2013 .
In all , Ms. Abedin was paid about $ 105,000 over seven months to advise Teneo in New York from summer 2012 to early 2013 , according to a person familiar with the arrangement . During the same time , she collected $ 126,239.80 in pay as a special government employee at the State Department , according to internal department records identifying her pay and leave that were obtained by The Times .
SEE ALSO : The Huma Files : Feds investigated top Hillary Clinton aide for embezzlement
The specific nature of Ms. Abedin ’ s duties at Teneo has been shrouded in mystery and has become the subject of State Department and congressional inquiries looking into whether the work arrangements were proper or created any conflicts of interest .
Several sources agreed to describe Ms. Abedin ’ s work for Teneo on the New York event and her subsequent work at the State Department for a Teneo-connected event in Ireland four months later in December , solely on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigations .
“ Huma ’ s role for the New York event was on behalf of Teneo , while her work for the Ireland event was clearly on behalf of the State Department . But the firm , the Clintons and Huma were intertwined , and that makes it hard to separate when looking back in hindsight , ” one person directly familiar with the circumstances said .
Added another source : “ Teneo didn ’ t need Huma to get Bill Clinton or the other luminaries to the event , but she was hired to help make the event successful in terms of who attended and what they experienced . ”
Teneo officials did not respond to calls seeking comment . Teneo , based in New York , employed Mr. Clinton as a consultant for about a year when it started , along with several other people from the Clinton circle . Mr. Clinton , who commands up to $ 700,000 per speech , did not charge Teneo for his appearance at the New York event , according to financial disclosure statements released by his wife .
Ms. Abedin ’ s attorney , Miguel Rodriguez , declined to comment publicly for this article . But he has steadfastly insisted that Ms. Abedin did nothing wrong in working for Teneo , the State Department and the Clinton Foundation at the same time , noting that government officials formally approved the arrangement .
Ethics analysts see it differently . They say the State Department put Ms. Abedin in a position to collect money from an outside firm that had interests and political connections inside the department where she still worked , creating at least the appearance of a conflict of interest .
“ The guidelines for becoming a special government employee make it quite clear it ’ s a unique position offered to someone as long as there is no conflict of interest , ” said Craig Holman , the government affairs lobbyist for the Public Citizen ethics watchdog . “ With Huma , she was in such a powerful position , conflicts were inevitable .
“ Huma never should have been provided special government employee status . She should ’ ve either remained a full-time employee at State or else become a full-time employee in the private sector , ” he said . “ To merge the two does raise a serious conflict of interest . ”
Added Scott Amey , general counsel for the Project on Government Oversight : “ It would have been more appropriate to avoid any potential conflicts and not work inside the State Department and at the same time work for an entity that had matters before the agency . Even if this is legal or received a waiver , it certainly doesn ’ t mean that it should have been allowed . ”
Internal State Department emails show the line dividing official government business , Teneo ’ s private business and the Clintons ’ own financial interests at times became blurred as Ms. Abedin and other top State officials dealt with requests that had little to do with their government jobs .
The New York event , which Ms. Abedin helped support for Teneo , was held just nine days after the horrific terrorist attack on a U.S. compound in Benghazi , Libya , that killed U.S . Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans .
In fact , Mrs. Clinton was on Capitol Hill briefing lawmakers in private about the tragedy just a few short hours before her husband entertained the Teneo event at the Essex House overlooking South Central Park , her official schedule shows . Ms. Abedin joined Mr. Clinton at the event while Mrs. Clinton remained in Washington , according to interviews .
The next morning , State Department officials were scrambling to address a potential crisis . But it was far from Libya and had nothing to do with federal business .
In their official government emails , top aides to Mrs. Clinton , including Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan , were discussing a private fundraising charity that would allow the Clintons to raise money on an upcoming trip to Ireland that had deep connections to Teneo ’ s clients and one of the firm ’ s founders , Declan Kelly .
Doug Band , a founding partner at Teneo and a longtime confidant to Mr. Clinton , was also included on the State Department email chain , which clearly had nothing to do with official business .
“ Stella O ’ Leary called to say she saw HRC this week and that HRC ‘ firmly instructed ’ her to urgently form a [ 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) nonprofit organization ] called Friends of the Clinton Centre , ” said an email from Amitabh Desai , the Clinton Foundation ’ s foreign policy director , dated Sept. 21 , 2012 .
The email was addressed to Ms. Mills , Mr. Sullivan , Mr . Band and Ms. Abedin , among others . “ I also asked if the new org could be flexible so that any funding raised could be used in whatever manner WJC [ initials of Mr. Clinton ] and HRC [ Mrs. Clinton ’ s initials ] wish in Ireland and Northern Ireland , and not restricted to support only the current iteration of the Clinton Centre in Enniskillen . ”
Ms. O ’ Leary is an active Democratic donor who founded the Irish American Democrats to support Mr. Clinton ’ s re-election in 1996 and has since been a top Clinton donor .
Ms. Abedin weighed in on the idea of setting up the fund , suggesting that Mr. Sullivan had witnessed the conversation . “ Jake was in the meeting so he can verify , ” Ms. Abedin wrote the following day , adding the qualifier , “ but HRC had said she made no commitments to her . ”
The tax-exempt fundraising arm was indeed established in 2013 and raised about $ 55,000 for an international summer school program to bring children from the Balkans and other conflict zones to Northern Ireland , Ms. O ’ Leary told CNN last month .
Mrs. Clinton ’ s spokesman , Nick Merrill , did not return an email message Tuesday seeking comment .
Eventually , Ms. Abedin would play a critical role in setting up the Ireland trip , a sort of farewell tour for Mrs. Clinton in a country where she and her husband were beloved . Teneo ’ s involvement in the trip was extensive .
The host , the World Ireland Fund , was connected to Teneo executives , and a Teneo representative was listed as a contact for the event honoring Mrs. Clinton . During her speech at the event , Mrs. Clinton went out of her way to acknowledge Teneo co-founder Declan Kelly , who worked as a special envoy at the State Department before starting the firm .
“ And I , too , will acknowledge and thank our former economic envoy , Declan Kelly , who has done so much to help bring more investors to the region , and I thank you for your contributions , Declan , ” Mrs. Clinton declared to applause from the crowd .
Behind the scenes , Ms. Abedin , on her official State Department email account , worked to set up a private dinner with Mrs. Clinton and top Teneo officials , bringing together figures from two of her employers .
“ Hi everyone — I know we ’ ve all be exchanging emails about HRC ’ s trip to Dublin and Belfast next week so I ’ m sending you details for the visit and if you have any questions , please let me know , ” Ms. Abedin wrote . “ Hillary is excited many of you are coming and hopes to see as much of you as possible . ”
Later in the week , she followed up : “ Hi everyone — wanted to follow up on plans for drinks/dinner on the 6th in Dublin . Thanks to John and Declan , we have a reservation at Restaurant 41 at the Residence Club . … See you Thursday ! ”
The “ John ” mentioned is hotel magnate John Fitzpatrick , founder of Fitzpatrick Hotel Group and longtime Clinton supporter .
A month earlier , Ms. Abedin took an entirely different tack , asking to step aside from another matter that had arisen inside the State Department that involved Teneo .
“ You should de-loop me from these exchanges , ” she wrote , using lowercase letters . “ … Now that teneo is involved , I feel I have a conflict so best not to be a part of this . It makes me uncomfortable . ”
Friends of Ms. Abedin , who spoke only on the condition of anonymity , declined to speculate why she agreed to work on one matter involving Teneo in Ireland and recused herself from another .
But they said the special government employee arrangement and temporary job at Teneo were designed more to help her transition to private life after an intense three years as a top deputy to Mrs. Clinton , followed by the birth of her first child and the embarrassment of her husband ’ s scandal .
“ Teneo had plenty of connections inside State already with heavy hitters like Doug Band and Declan Kelly , and they didn ’ t need Huma to make things happen there , ” one friend said . “ But Huma needed to sort out what she was going to do next with a new child , a new home in New York , a husband who lost his job in Congress and her longtime boss stepping down . And this arrangement helped . ”
Ms. Abedin ’ s email workload seemed to reflect that transition . As deputy chief of staff , she averaged sending 2,193 emails a month through her official State account , but only 1,103 a month after she became a special government employee in 2012 , according to an analysis conducted by Sate Department investigators .
Joe Birkenstock , a partner with Sandler Reiff Lamb in Washington , said special government employee status is given frequently to help government employees as they are leaving their jobs .
“ Honestly , nothing about this status has made me stop and question it . This is why the SGE status exists , so that employees can continue on in this multiple-role capacity so they can finish up whatever it is on their way out , ” Mr. Birkenstock said . “ The concern is whether anybody in that position would use it to advance their own personal financial interest , and it doesn ’ t look like Huma was in a position to do that . ”
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley , Iowa Republican , sees it differently , saying Ms. Abedin ’ s varying roles blurred the lines between government business and private business .
“ Multiple employers often mean competing or overlapping interests , ” the senator told The Times . “ Managing and preventing conflicts of interest are extremely important . In this case , the lack of transparency and the difficulty in determining when a government official is actually working for the government or a private entity make it difficult to determine whether conflicts of interest were avoided appropriately . That ’ s why the exemption for special government employees should be limited to cases where there is a truly exceptional government need for specialized knowledge or skills that can ’ t be found any other way . The goal behind asking these questions is to make sure government programs and laws , as well as government officials , are working as intended to serve the public , not other employers . ”
The questions about blurred lines are taking on new significance as both the State Department inspector general and Mr. Grassley ’ s committee investigate whether Ms. Abedin ’ s special government employee contract was properly executed and accounted for and whether she engaged in any conflicts of interest .
David Bossie , a former congressional investigator and founder of the conservative group Citizens United , which sued to win access to Ms. Abedin ’ s emails , said the messages “ pull back the curtain on how the Clintons do business . ”
“ The Clintons and their cronies know no shame and will do anything to enrich themselves or their friends and allies , ” Mr. Bossie said . “ Using the foundation , using a private corporation and using the assets of the State Department all for the enrichment of their friends [ are ] all part of their normal business . ”
In a letter addressed to the State Department about her consulting work , Ms. Abedin insisted she never intervened in State Department matters on behalf of Teneo clients and simply provided “ strategic advice and consulting services to the firm ’ s management team ” while helping “ organize a major annual firm event . ”
“ I was not asked , nor did I undertake , any work on Teneo ’ s behalf before the Department , ” Ms. Abedin wrote in the letter dated July 5 , 2013 , that Mr. Grassley released .
Investigators determined that Ms. Abedin charged more hours to her special government employee contract than was allowed by law , according to documents obtained by The Times . That alone , however , would not be enough to void the special protections against indirect conflicts of interest that the status afforded her , according to Office of Government Ethics rules . But a finding of a direct conflict of interest could lead to some form of action , officials said .
In New York , the Essex House event attracted a high-power guest list including Harvey Weinstein , Eli Broad , Blackstone co-founders Stephen Schwarzman and Peter Peterson , Silicon Valley impresario Sean Parker , Billie Jean King , George E. Pataki , and New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly , along with CEOs and top executives from companies such as Dow Chemical , Coca-Cola , BP and Bank of America , according to a report by the New Republic .
The three former heads of state , Mr. Clinton , Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair , were slated to take the stage at 7 p.m. to give their speeches , but they were delayed backstage — by a long sales pitch made by a Teneo co-founder , the magazine reported .
“ Instead of introducing his distinguished guests , he launched into a long-winded sales pitch , ” the New Republic reports . “ Teneo was the next big thing in executive consulting , he informed the audience . He played a promotional video about the firm . He introduced the heads of Teneo ’ s divisions , describing their resumes and asking each to stand in turn . Meanwhile , the onetime guardians of the [ U.S.-British ] special relationship were left loitering awkwardly in the wings . ‘ It was unnecessarily inappropriate , ’ said one guest . ‘ It was flagrant. ’ “","While still working at the State Department, Hillary Rodham Clinton confidante Huma Abedin was paid by the private consulting firm Teneo Holdings to help stage a star-studded reception that included her boss’ husband, Bill Clinton, along with George W. Bush and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair as speakers just days after the Benghazi tragedy, The Washington Times has learned.

Ms. Abedin’s work on the Sept. 20, 2012, event at the glamorous Essex House in New York City, helped entertain potential Teneo clients, wowing them with access to three former world leaders on a single stage.

It was one of the specific projects she worked on with Teneo during a seven-month period in which she earned a $15,000-a-month consulting fee from the firm while simultaneously receiving pay as a “special government employee” advising Mrs. Clinton at the State Department, according to interviews and documents.

Ms. Abedin, the wife of former Rep. Anthony D. Weiner of New York, worked as a full-time government employee and deputy chief of staff to Secretary of State Clinton from 2009 through mid-2012. She then moved to New York and transitioned to a part-time employee at State after giving birth to her first child and seeing her husband resign his congressional seat because of a sexting scandal.

The special government employee status at the State Department allowed Ms. Abedin to simultaneously take on other consulting work, as with Teneo and the Clinton Foundation, where she assessed the charity’s ongoing programs to pave the way for Mrs. Clinton’s return there after she left the State Department in early 2013.

In all, Ms. Abedin was paid about $105,000 over seven months to advise Teneo in New York from summer 2012 to early 2013, according to a person familiar with the arrangement. During the same time, she collected $126,239.80 in pay as a special government employee at the State Department, according to internal department records identifying her pay and leave that were obtained by The Times.

The specific nature of Ms. Abedin’s duties at Teneo has been shrouded in mystery and has become the subject of State Department and congressional inquiries looking into whether the work arrangements were proper or created any conflicts of interest.

Several sources agreed to describe Ms. Abedin’s work for Teneo on the New York event and her subsequent work at the State Department for a Teneo-connected event in Ireland four months later in December, solely on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigations.

“Huma’s role for the New York event was on behalf of Teneo, while her work for the Ireland event was clearly on behalf of the State Department. But the firm, the Clintons and Huma were intertwined, and that makes it hard to separate when looking back in hindsight,” one person directly familiar with the circumstances said.

Added another source: “Teneo didn’t need Huma to get Bill Clinton or the other luminaries to the event, but she was hired to help make the event successful in terms of who attended and what they experienced.”

Teneo officials did not respond to calls seeking comment. Teneo, based in New York, employed Mr. Clinton as a consultant for about a year when it started, along with several other people from the Clinton circle. Mr. Clinton, who commands up to $700,000 per speech, did not charge Teneo for his appearance at the New York event, according to financial disclosure statements released by his wife.

Ms. Abedin’s attorney, Miguel Rodriguez, declined to comment publicly for this article. But he has steadfastly insisted that Ms. Abedin did nothing wrong in working for Teneo, the State Department and the Clinton Foundation at the same time, noting that government officials formally approved the arrangement.

Ethics questions

Ethics analysts see it differently. They say the State Department put Ms. Abedin in a position to collect money from an outside firm that had interests and political connections inside the department where she still worked, creating at least the appearance of a conflict of interest.

“The guidelines for becoming a special government employee make it quite clear it’s a unique position offered to someone as long as there is no conflict of interest,” said Craig Holman, the government affairs lobbyist for the Public Citizen ethics watchdog. “With Huma, she was in such a powerful position, conflicts were inevitable.

“Huma never should have been provided special government employee status. She should’ve either remained a full-time employee at State or else become a full-time employee in the private sector,” he said. “To merge the two does raise a serious conflict of interest.”

Added Scott Amey, general counsel for the Project on Government Oversight: “It would have been more appropriate to avoid any potential conflicts and not work inside the State Department and at the same time work for an entity that had matters before the agency. Even if this is legal or received a waiver, it certainly doesn’t mean that it should have been allowed.”

state_department,The Flip Side,1,https://www.theflipside.io/archives/state-department-ig-fired,State Department IG Fired,,,"“ Trump has neutered Congress ’ s ability to conduct oversight , and even if he has not convinced the judiciary that it can not be involved—indeed , some judges have laughed his attorneys out of court—he has managed to neuter it with foot-dragging as well . The inspectors general , as executive-branch officers with a conduit to Congress , were a remaining check , albeit a weaker one . This no longer seems true… “ Voters can decide to eject a lawless president from office—but only every four years , and even then only after a first term : A second-term president would find himself without any accountability at all . It is almost impossible to reconcile this vision with the checks and balances laid out by the Founders , but what the Trump administration has found is , there ’ s no need to reconcile it . All it has to do is enact it. ” David A. Graham , The Atlantic
“ Many of the IGs who oversee 73 federal agencies probably aren ’ t very popular with their colleagues… Government workers complain about nitpicking and prolonged reviews . A summons to the IG ’ s office can be an invitation to months of scrutiny and potential recrimination . But most public servants accept that this intrusive scrutiny comes with the job of spending the public ’ s money… “ Linick has usefully annoyed State Department officials through two administrations . In December 2013 , the year he was appointed , he issued a ‘ management alert ’ about cybersecurity breaches that roiled State Department officials but proved to be prescient . In June 2015 , to the everlasting regret of former secretary Hillary Clinton , he began investigating ‘ hundreds of potentially classified emails ’ that had been on Clinton ’ s private email server… An IG ’ s job is to be meddlesome… The United States isn ’ t a family business . It ’ s a multi-trillion-dollar global operation . It needs independent auditors. ” David Ignatius , Washington Post
“ The purge makes a mockery of Congress ’ s attempt to protect the independence of inspectors general , including a legal requirement that they not be removed without written [ justification ] . In the case of Mr. Linick , Mr. Trump dispatched a vague letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D-Calif. ) saying he ‘ no longer ’ had ‘ the fullest confidence ’ in the IG ... “ But Mr. Pompeo did not hesitate to blurt out the real reason Monday : Mr. Linick was not doing his bidding . He ‘ wasn ’ t performing a function in a way that we had tried to get him to , ’ Mr. Pompeo said in an interview . But it is not the inspector general ’ s job to do what the secretary of state demands — especially when it comes to investigating his own behavior. ” Editorial Board , Washington Post
“ The Inspector General Act of 1978 says that the head of the department ( Pompeo , in Linick 's case ) ‘ shall not prevent or prohibit the [ IG ] from initiating , carrying out , or completing any audit or investigation. ’ We do n't know specifically if Linick was fired because of this investigation… but a State Department source confirmed that Pompeo made the recommendation for Linick to be removed… “ The Inspector General Act of 1987 and other related legislation lay out the IG 's responsibility and mandate : to prevent waste , fraud and abuse within the government 's bureaucracy -- independently and objectively . The President 's attempts to sideline or silence IGs who are fulfilling these responsibilities will only support the politicization of our federal government and prop up officials who accede to pressure and turn a blind eye to wrongdoing. ” Samantha Vinograd , CNN
“ The [ arms ] sales were linked to discussions the administration had with Raytheon , the defense contractor which heavily lobbied for the arms sales , according to The New York Times . Congress had blocked the sales after bomb fragments traced to the contractor were linked to Saudi bombings that killed civilians and children . Democrats also questioned the potential conflicts of interest of a State Department official involved in the deal who had previously worked as a lobbyist for Raytheon . But the deal drew criticism from both sides of the aisle in Congress , where even Republicans called the move ‘ unfortunate. ’ ” Igor Derysh , Salon
“ Asked what specifically Linick was doing that he thought warranted his dismissal , the president said , ‘ I don ’ t know . I don ’ t know anything about him . I don ’ t know anything other than the State Department , and Mike in particular , I guess they were not happy with the job he ’ s doing or something ’ … Trump dodged a question about whether he thinks Pompeo asking for Linick ’ s firing amid an active investigation into himself creates a conflict of interest , saying , ‘ I don ’ t think it sounds , like , that important ’ … “ Trump didn ’ t even try to hide that he doesn ’ t think there should be any oversight of his administration conducted by someone who isn ’ t personally loyal to him , nor does he think it ’ s wrong for government officials to stymie investigations into their own conduct by firing the investigators. ” Aaron Rupar , Vox
“ I am not a fan of the institution of inspector general because it is constitutionally suspect , to say the least . An IG works in the executive branch , and is therefore subordinate to the president , yet reports to Congress . This is a hybrid that flouts separation-of-powers principles… it was inevitable that IG positions would be politicized . They are designed that way , and the party out of power has always relied on IGs as a vehicle for addling the White House…
“ It would be better to reserve judgment until we know what actually happened . It is possible that the president is engaged in a pattern of retaliation over the Russia investigation , his impeachment over the Ukraine kerfuffle , and criticism over his handling of the coronavirus emergency… Nevertheless , it is also true that the president ’ s capacity to govern has been damaged by heinous allegations that have turned out to be either baseless or greatly exaggerated ; from his perspective , IGs have contributed to that damage . ”
Some argue , “ Presidents do have the authority to fire inspectors general and President Trump is not the first president to do so . However , he seems to be the first president to so blatantly fire three IGs for doing their jobs and a fourth in an attempt to avoid oversight of how relief funds are spent . President Trump was elected based on a promise to ‘ drain the swamp , ’ but his actions since taking office have seemed as swampy as anything that previous occupants of the White House have done . ”
Dated But Relevant : During the Obama administration , “ Republicans in Congress used IGs to investigate all sorts of government waste and abuse . The work of inspectors general constitutes the backbone of reports like Federal Fumbles : Ways the federal government dropped the ball , a report which details $ 383 billion in wasteful and inefficient federal spending . If IG recommendations were followed each year , the country would net $ 50 billion in savings . A recent Congressional report found that every dollar spent on inspectors general returns more than $ 22 in potential savings…
“ Critically , it was the work of the Office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction ( SIGAR ) that led to the infuriating revelations of the Afghanistan Papers , a trove of interviews with over 600 people with firsthand knowledge of the war , including generals , diplomats , aid workers , and Afghan officials detailing unconscionable lies , spin , and over a trillion dollars wasted with no strategy at all . All of this would have been lost to history without the work of the inspector general . ”
Others note that “ President Barack Obama did not nominate an inspector general for the State Department during his entire first term . In fact , the post was vacant for nearly four years . The last inspector general under President George W. Bush , Howard J. Krongard , resigned in December 2007 . The position was vacant for nearly six years until the Senate confirmed Linick in September 2013… When Republicans raised questions about the vacancy , their concerns were dismissed . The Obama administration and [ Secretary of State Hillary ] Clinton herself defended the performance of the acting inspector general . ”
“ House Democrats may want to hold their fire and take a look at a report which appeared in The Washington Post on Monday… Brian Bulatao , the State Department ’ s undersecretary for management , told The Post that Linick had been fired due to an alleged ‘ pattern of unauthorized disclosures , or leaks to the news media about investigations that were in an early draft form. ’ According to The Post , Bulatao said that ‘ officials had no evidence Linick was personally responsible for the leaks but that the disclosures had the potential of tainting the outcome of ongoing probes ’ …
“ Bulatao said the matter first arose last fall after media reports about an ongoing investigation that cited ‘ two government sources involved in carrying out the investigation . You know the IG is normally charged with carrying out the investigation . It certainly was a very strong finger-pointing at IG Linick ’ s way. ’ Bulatao [ further ] told The Post that ‘ Linick had ignored the directions of then-deputy secretary of state John Sullivan to refer the leak investigation to the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency so that an inspector general from another agency could be appointed to look into it . ’ ”","“Trump has neutered Congress’s ability to conduct oversight, and even if he has not convinced the judiciary that it cannot be involved—indeed, some judges have laughed his attorneys out of court—he has managed to neuter it with foot-dragging as well. The inspectors general, as executive-branch officers with a conduit to Congress, were a remaining check, albeit a weaker one . This no longer seems true… “Voters can decide to eject a lawless president from office—but only every four years, and even then only after a first term: A second-term president would find himself without any accountability at all. It is almost impossible to reconcile this vision with the checks and balances laid out by the Founders, but what the Trump administration has found is, there’s no need to reconcile it. All it has to do is enact it.” David A. Graham, The Atlantic

“Many of the IGs who oversee 73 federal agencies probably aren’t very popular with their colleagues… Government workers complain about nitpicking and prolonged reviews. A summons to the IG’s office can be an invitation to months of scrutiny and potential recrimination. But most public servants accept that this intrusive scrutiny comes with the job of spending the public’s money… “ Linick has usefully annoyed State Department officials through two administrations . In December 2013, the year he was appointed, he issued a ‘management alert’ about cybersecurity breaches that roiled State Department officials but proved to be prescient. In June 2015, to the everlasting regret of former secretary Hillary Clinton, he began investigating ‘hundreds of potentially classified emails’ that had been on Clinton’s private email server… An IG’s job is to be meddlesome… The United States isn’t a family business. It’s a multi-trillion-dollar global operation. It needs independent auditors.” David Ignatius, Washington Post

“The purge makes a mockery of Congress’s attempt to protect the independence of inspectors general, including a legal requirement that they not be removed without written [justification]. In the case of Mr. Linick, Mr. Trump dispatched a vague letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) saying he ‘no longer’ had ‘the fullest confidence’ in the IG... “But Mr. Pompeo did not hesitate to blurt out the real reason Monday : Mr. Linick was not doing his bidding. He ‘wasn’t performing a function in a way that we had tried to get him to,’ Mr. Pompeo said in an interview. But it is not the inspector general’s job to do what the secretary of state demands — especially when it comes to investigating his own behavior.” Editorial Board, Washington Post

“The Inspector General Act of 1978 says that the head of the department (Pompeo, in Linick's case) ‘shall not prevent or prohibit the [IG] from initiating, carrying out, or completing any audit or investigation.’ We don't know specifically if Linick was fired because of this investigation… but a State Department source confirmed that Pompeo made the recommendation for Linick to be removed… “ The Inspector General Act of 1987 and other related legislation lay out the IG's responsibility and mandate : to prevent waste, fraud and abuse within the government's bureaucracy -- independently and objectively. The President's attempts to sideline or silence IGs who are fulfilling these responsibilities will only support the politicization of our federal government and prop up officials who accede to pressure and turn a blind eye to wrongdoing.” Samantha Vinograd, CNN

“The [arms] sales were linked to discussions the administration had with Raytheon, the defense contractor which heavily lobbied for the arms sales, according to The New York Times. Congress had blocked the sales after bomb fragments traced to the contractor were linked to Saudi bombings that killed civilians and children. Democrats also questioned the potential conflicts of interest of a State Department official involved in the deal who had previously worked as a lobbyist for Raytheon. But the deal drew criticism from both sides of the aisle in Congress, where even Republicans called the move ‘unfortunate.’” Igor Derysh, Salon

“Asked what specifically Linick was doing that he thought warranted his dismissal, the president said, ‘I don’t know. I don’t know anything about him. I don’t know anything other than the State Department, and Mike in particular, I guess they were not happy with the job he’s doing or something’… Trump dodged a question about whether he thinks Pompeo asking for Linick’s firing amid an active investigation into himself creates a conflict of interest, saying, ‘I don’t think it sounds, like, that important’… “Trump didn’t even try to hide that he doesn’t think there should be any oversight of his administration conducted by someone who isn’t personally loyal to him, nor does he think it’s wrong for government officials to stymie investigations into their own conduct by firing the investigators.” Aaron Rupar, Vox

From the Right

The right is divided over the firings.

The right is divided over the firings.

“I am not a fan of the institution of inspector general because it is constitutionally suspect, to say the least. An IG works in the executive branch, and is therefore subordinate to the president, yet reports to Congress. This is a hybrid that flouts separation-of-powers principles… it was inevitable that IG positions would be politicized. They are designed that way, and the party out of power has always relied on IGs as a vehicle for addling the White House…



“It would be better to reserve judgment until we know what actually happened. It is possible that the president is engaged in a pattern of retaliation over the Russia investigation, his impeachment over the Ukraine kerfuffle, and criticism over his handling of the coronavirus emergency… Nevertheless, it is also true that the president’s capacity to govern has been damaged by heinous allegations that have turned out to be either baseless or greatly exaggerated; from his perspective, IGs have contributed to that damage.”

Andrew C. McCarthy, National Review

Some argue, “Presidents do have the authority to fire inspectors general and President Trump is not the first president to do so. However, he seems to be the first president to so blatantly fire three IGs for doing their jobs and a fourth in an attempt to avoid oversight of how relief funds are spent. President Trump was elected based on a promise to ‘drain the swamp,’ but his actions since taking office have seemed as swampy as anything that previous occupants of the White House have done.”

David Thornton, The Resurgent

Dated But Relevant: During the Obama administration, “Republicans in Congress used IGs to investigate all sorts of government waste and abuse. The work of inspectors general constitutes the backbone of reports like Federal Fumbles: Ways the federal government dropped the ball, a report which details $383 billion in wasteful and inefficient federal spending. If IG recommendations were followed each year, the country would net $50 billion in savings. A recent Congressional report found that every dollar spent on inspectors general returns more than $22 in potential savings…



“Critically, it was the work of the Office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) that led to the infuriating revelations of the Afghanistan Papers, a trove of interviews with over 600 people with firsthand knowledge of the war, including generals, diplomats, aid workers, and Afghan officials detailing unconscionable lies, spin, and over a trillion dollars wasted with no strategy at all. All of this would have been lost to history without the work of the inspector general.”

Barbara Boland, The American Conservative

Others note that “President Barack Obama did not nominate an inspector general for the State Department during his entire first term. In fact, the post was vacant for nearly four years. The last inspector general under President George W. Bush, Howard J. Krongard, resigned in December 2007. The position was vacant for nearly six years until the Senate confirmed Linick in September 2013… When Republicans raised questions about the vacancy, their concerns were dismissed. The Obama administration and [Secretary of State Hillary] Clinton herself defended the performance of the acting inspector general.”

Joel B. Pollak, Breitbart

“House Democrats may want to hold their fire and take a look at a report which appeared in The Washington Post on Monday… Brian Bulatao, the State Department’s undersecretary for management, told The Post that Linick had been fired due to an alleged ‘pattern of unauthorized disclosures, or leaks to the news media about investigations that were in an early draft form.’ According to The Post, Bulatao said that ‘officials had no evidence Linick was personally responsible for the leaks but that the disclosures had the potential of tainting the outcome of ongoing probes’…



“Bulatao said the matter first arose last fall after media reports about an ongoing investigation that cited ‘two government sources involved in carrying out the investigation. You know the IG is normally charged with carrying out the investigation. It certainly was a very strong finger-pointing at IG Linick’s way.’ Bulatao [further] told The Post that ‘Linick had ignored the directions of then-deputy secretary of state John Sullivan to refer the leak investigation to the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency so that an inspector general from another agency could be appointed to look into it.’”

The end was a perfect metaphor for the relationship. The odd couple of politics had been yoked together for too long.

Men of different temperaments, demeanour and style had reached a parting of the ways.

The secretary of state landed back at Joint Base Andrews to have a member of staff inform him that the president had tweeted.

Because Mr Tillerson is not on Twitter, the tweet had to be printed out. Fancy being the one tasked with handing that over to the boss. Fired by a tweet.

That meant that during her four years in office and nearly two years afterward , the State Department was not searching those documents in response to open-records requests from Congress or the public .
Last month , the State Department finally finished processing more than 30,000 pages of Mrs. Clinton ’ s emails and made them public on the department ’ s Freedom of Information Act web page — a mammoth undertaking that has put a treasure trove of information in the public ’ s eye .
Judicial Watch and others argue that some 30,000 other messages Mrs. Clinton sent from her secret address during her time in office , but which she has deemed private business , should also be reviewed by the government .
The State Department told Judge Lamberth it never misled the public because it never said it was searching Mrs. Clinton ’ s emails in the first place . The department said that meant it wasn ’ t acting in bad faith when it responded to open-records requests .
Judge Lamberth , though , said more evidence is needed before those conclusions can be reached .
“ The government argues that this does not show a lack of good faith , but that is what remains to be seen , and the factual record must be developed appropriately in order for this court to make that determination , ” he said in a brief ruling .
The Justice Department declined to comment on Judge Lamberth ’ s ruling , which marks the third legal black eye for the Obama administration in recent weeks .
Last week , a federal appeals court said the Justice Department was turning the law on its head to protect the IRS from taxpayers , rather than to protect taxpayers from the IRS .

Moammar Gadhafi from power , an event that has left his country in chaos , according to officials with direct knowledge of the dispute .
Defense officials , speaking in detail for the first time about their assessments of the Libyan civil war four years ago , told The ███ that Mrs. Clinton ’ s strong advocacy for intervention against the Libyan regime rested more on speculative arguments of what might happen to civilians than on facts reported from the ground .
“ It was an intelligence-light decision , ” said one senior U.S. intelligence official directly familiar with the Libyan matter , who spoke to The ███ only on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to reporters .
The official ’ s sentiments were echoed by nearly a dozen other key players inside the intelligence and military communities who described to The Times a frustrating period during which the concerns of senior military leaders , including Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Mike Mullen , were repeatedly cast aside .
SEE ALSO : Listen to the tapes : Intel undercuts Hillary Clinton ’ s primary argument for Libya military action
Speculative arguments often trumped reporting from the ground , the officials added .
The intelligence community wasn ’ t the only one concerned that Mrs. Clinton was selling the war on exaggerated pretenses .
In secretly tape-recorded conversations , an emissary sent by the Pentagon and Democratic Rep. Dennis J. Kucinich openly discussed with Gadhafi regime officials in 2011 concerns that there was a false narrative being used to sell the war , The ███ reported Thursday .
In one pointed conversation , the officials suggested Mrs. Clinton was engaging in the same misleading tactics as the George W. Bush administration when it went to war with Iraq in 2003 claiming the country had large stocks weapons of mass destruction , a claim that proved to be inaccurate .
“ It was like the WMDs in Iraq . It was based on a false report , ” Seif Gadhafi , the son of the Libyan leader , said in a May 2011 phone call with Mr. Kucinich . “ Libyan airplanes bombing demonstrators , Libyan airplanes bombing districts in Tripoli , Libyan army killed thousands , etc. , etc. , and now the whole world found there is no single evidence that such things happened in Libya . ”
The gap between Mrs. Clinton ’ s rhetoric warning of a Rwanda-like slaughter of civilians in Libya and the facts gathered by career intelligence staff is taking on significance as the former secretary of state prepares another bid for the White House and her national security credentials are re-examined .
When the Arab Spring fervor touched off a civil war in Libya in early 2011 , U.S. officials were caught off guard . The CIA had little information about the rebels leading the fight , the Libyans who set up an interim government or Gadhafi ’ s own intentions in repressing the rebellion , officials said .
In fact , intelligence agencies didn ’ t even have a good estimate of how many civilians were living in Benghazi , which was expected to be the conflict ’ s flashpoint , officials told The Times .
The DIA was put into the lead role for assessing the situation , and a separate working group within the Pentagon ’ s joint chiefs quickly gathered valuable insights from an American asset who was in direct contact with the Gadhafi regime , including the leader ’ s son Seif and Mohammad Ismael , Seif Gadhafi ’ s chief of staff .
Soon , however , the information being gathered by the intelligence community was at loggerheads with claims of the main supporters for war with Libya , which included French President Nicolas Sarkozy ; Sen. John McCain , Arizona Republican ; Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John F. Kerry , Massachusetts Democrat ; and three powerful women close to President Obama : Mrs. Clinton ; Susan E. Rice , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations ; and adviser Samantha Powers .
Mrs. Clinton ultimately became the most powerful advocate for using U.S. military force to dethrone Gadhafi , both in her closed-door meetings with Mr. Obama , who ultimately made the decision , and in public with allies and the news media
Her argument was best summed up in comments she made in March 2011 , when she warned that Gadhafi was on the cusp of a genocide against civilians in Benghazi on par with those in Rwanda and Bosnia in the 1990s when her husband , Bill , was president .
“ Imagine we were sitting here and Benghazi had been overrun , a city of 700,000 people , and tens of thousands of people had been slaughtered , hundreds of thousands had fled either with nowhere to go , or overwhelming Egypt while it ’ s in its own difficult transition , ” Mrs. Clinton told ABC News on March 27 after the U.S. signed off on a U.N. resolution granting military intervention .
If “ we were sitting here , the cries would be , ‘ Why did the United States not do anything ? ’ ” she predicted .
The intelligence community had few facts to back up Mrs. Clinton ’ s audacious predictions , officials told The Times .
In fact , the Pentagon ’ s judgment was that Gadhafi was unlikely to risk world outrage by inflicting large civilian casualties as he cracked down on the rebels based in Benghazi , the officials said .
The specific intelligence was that Gadhafi had sent a relatively small — by Western standards — cadre of about 2,000 troops armed with 12 tanks to target armed rebels in Benghazi . Ground intelligence indicated that the Gadhafi forces were defeating the rebels , killing about 400 and wounding many more .
In comparison , 10,000 people have been killed at the hands of Boko Haram in Nigeria in the past year alone . Estimates of the number of people killed in Rwanda , mostly Tutsi civilians , range from 500,000 to 1 million over a 100-day period . The Bosnia war lasted , at varying levels of intensity , for three years and claimed at least 100,000 lives , with some estimates reaching 200,000 .
Some accounts said the Libyan forces were attacking unarmed protesters , but no genocide was reported , the officials said . There was strong evidence that most civilians fled Benghazi ahead of the expected battle , officials said .
Furthermore , defense officials had direct information from their intelligence asset in contact with the regime that Gadhafi gave specific orders not to attack civilians and to narrowly focus the war on the armed rebels , according to the asset , who survived the war .
All spoke to The Times on the condition of anonymity but confirmed Col. Gadhafi ’ s order .
Defense officials said the Gadhafi forces were serious about routing the uprising and that some collateral damage to civilians remained possible , though they were unable to give the White House specifics . No intelligence suggested that a genocide was imminent , the officials said .
“ Gadhafi was serious , but I wouldn ’ t classify it as Rwanda , ” said an unidentified defense official close to the intelligence available at the time .
Mrs. Clinton is keeping mum these days about Libya as she mulls a run for president , in part because the subsequent assault on the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi by an Islamist militia and her reaction to the incident have come under harsh criticism .
Along with other administration officials , Mrs. Clinton falsely blamed that attack , which killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans , on an anti-Islam video . She also famously asked , “ What difference does it make ” whether the attack was planned terrorism or a spontaneous protest as she had claimed .
The State Department confirmed that its primary goal in 2011 was regime change , meaning ousting Gadhafi from power . But it deferred comment to Mrs. Clinton about the specifics on intelligence and her own public statements .

The intelligence community gathered no specific evidence of an impending genocide in Libya in spring 2011, undercutting Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton’s primary argument for using the U.S. military to remove Col. Moammar Gadhafi from power, an event that has left his country in chaos, according to officials with direct knowledge of the dispute.

Defense officials, speaking in detail for the first time about their assessments of the Libyan civil war four years ago, told The Washington Times that Mrs. Clinton’s strong advocacy for intervention against the Libyan regime rested more on speculative arguments of what might happen to civilians than on facts reported from the ground.

The Defense Intelligence Agency ran the Libya intelligence operation.

“It was an intelligence-light decision,” said one senior U.S. intelligence official directly familiar with the Libyan matter, who spoke to The Washington Times only on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to reporters.

The official’s sentiments were echoed by nearly a dozen other key players inside the intelligence and military communities who described to The Times a frustrating period during which the concerns of senior military leaders, including Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Mike Mullen, were repeatedly cast aside.

Speculative arguments often trumped reporting from the ground, the officials added.

The intelligence community wasn’t the only one concerned that Mrs. Clinton was selling the war on exaggerated pretenses.

In secretly tape-recorded conversations, an emissary sent by the Pentagon and Democratic Rep. Dennis J. Kucinich openly discussed with Gadhafi regime officials in 2011 concerns that there was a false narrative being used to sell the war, The Washington Times reported Thursday.

In one pointed conversation, the officials suggested Mrs. Clinton was engaging in the same misleading tactics as the George W. Bush administration when it went to war with Iraq in 2003 claiming the country had large stocks weapons of mass destruction, a claim that proved to be inaccurate.

“It was like the WMDs in Iraq. It was based on a false report,” Seif Gadhafi, the son of the Libyan leader, said in a May 2011 phone call with Mr. Kucinich. “Libyan airplanes bombing demonstrators, Libyan airplanes bombing districts in Tripoli, Libyan army killed thousands, etc., etc., and now the whole world found there is no single evidence that such things happened in Libya.”

The gap between Mrs. Clinton’s rhetoric warning of a Rwanda-like slaughter of civilians in Libya and the facts gathered by career intelligence staff is taking on significance as the former secretary of state prepares another bid for the White House and her national security credentials are re-examined.

Predictions of genocide

When the Arab Spring fervor touched off a civil war in Libya in early 2011, U.S. officials were caught off guard. The CIA had little information about the rebels leading the fight, the Libyans who set up an interim government or Gadhafi’s own intentions in repressing the rebellion, officials said.

In fact, intelligence agencies didn’t even have a good estimate of how many civilians were living in Benghazi, which was expected to be the conflict’s flashpoint, officials told The Times.

The DIA was put into the lead role for assessing the situation, and a separate working group within the Pentagon’s joint chiefs quickly gathered valuable insights from an American asset who was in direct contact with the Gadhafi regime, including the leader’s son Seif and Mohammad Ismael, Seif Gadhafi’s chief of staff.

Soon, however, the information being gathered by the intelligence community was at loggerheads with claims of the main supporters for war with Libya, which included French President Nicolas Sarkozy; Sen. John McCain, Arizona Republican; Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John F. Kerry, Massachusetts Democrat; and three powerful women close to President Obama: Mrs. Clinton; Susan E. Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations; and adviser Samantha Powers.

Mrs. Clinton ultimately became the most powerful advocate for using U.S. military force to dethrone Gadhafi, both in her closed-door meetings with Mr. Obama, who ultimately made the decision, and in public with allies and the news media

Her argument was best summed up in comments she made in March 2011, when she warned that Gadhafi was on the cusp of a genocide against civilians in Benghazi on par with those in Rwanda and Bosnia in the 1990s when her husband, Bill, was president.

“Imagine we were sitting here and Benghazi had been overrun, a city of 700,000 people, and tens of thousands of people had been slaughtered, hundreds of thousands had fled either with nowhere to go, or overwhelming Egypt while it’s in its own difficult transition,” Mrs. Clinton told ABC News on March 27 after the U.S. signed off on a U.N. resolution granting military intervention.

If “we were sitting here, the cries would be, ‘Why did the United States not do anything?’” she predicted.

Few objective indicators

The intelligence community had few facts to back up Mrs. Clinton’s audacious predictions, officials told The Times.

In fact, the Pentagon’s judgment was that Gadhafi was unlikely to risk world outrage by inflicting large civilian casualties as he cracked down on the rebels based in Benghazi, the officials said.

The specific intelligence was that Gadhafi had sent a relatively small — by Western standards — cadre of about 2,000 troops armed with 12 tanks to target armed rebels in Benghazi. Ground intelligence indicated that the Gadhafi forces were defeating the rebels, killing about 400 and wounding many more.

In comparison, 10,000 people have been killed at the hands of Boko Haram in Nigeria in the past year alone. Estimates of the number of people killed in Rwanda, mostly Tutsi civilians, range from 500,000 to 1 million over a 100-day period. The Bosnia war lasted, at varying levels of intensity, for three years and claimed at least 100,000 lives, with some estimates reaching 200,000.

Some accounts said the Libyan forces were attacking unarmed protesters, but no genocide was reported, the officials said. There was strong evidence that most civilians fled Benghazi ahead of the expected battle, officials said.

Furthermore, defense officials had direct information from their intelligence asset in contact with the regime that Gadhafi gave specific orders not to attack civilians and to narrowly focus the war on the armed rebels, according to the asset, who survived the war.

All spoke to The Times on the condition of anonymity but confirmed Col. Gadhafi’s order.

Defense officials said the Gadhafi forces were serious about routing the uprising and that some collateral damage to civilians remained possible, though they were unable to give the White House specifics. No intelligence suggested that a genocide was imminent, the officials said.

“Gadhafi was serious, but I wouldn’t classify it as Rwanda,” said an unidentified defense official close to the intelligence available at the time.

Political issue

Mrs. Clinton is keeping mum these days about Libya as she mulls a run for president, in part because the subsequent assault on the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi by an Islamist militia and her reaction to the incident have come under harsh criticism.

Along with other administration officials, Mrs. Clinton falsely blamed that attack, which killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans, on an anti-Islam video. She also famously asked, “What difference does it make” whether the attack was planned terrorism or a spontaneous protest as she had claimed.

Her official representative declined to comment for this report.

The State Department confirmed that its primary goal in 2011 was regime change, meaning ousting Gadhafi from power. But it deferred comment to Mrs. Clinton about the specifics on intelligence and her own public statements.

Mr. Kerry, who succeeded Mrs. Clinton as secretary of state, backed the Libya intervention with similar language. He told The New York Times that “the memory of Rwanda, alongside Iraq in ‘91, made it clear that the United States needed to act but needed international support.”

With the benefit of hindsight, diplomatic analysts frown on such comparisons to Rwanda and say the rhetoric in 2011 was simply overstated.

“We are prone to think in terms of analogies, and the analogy in Rwanda was one that administration officials like Hillary Clinton and others used, and I think it was an inappropriate analogy because you cannot say Libya was Rwanda,” said Paul Miller, who served as an adviser on security matters for Mr. Obama and Mr. Bush.

“[Libya] was a war between an autocratic government and a bunch of tribes, and amidst that kind of war there will be a humanitarian crisis, there will be innocent people killed. But that is very different than a straight genocide against a group,” Mr. Miller said.

The notion that a genocide was imminent was rooted in Gadhafi’s Feb. 22, 2011, speech in which he pledged to “sanitize Libya an inch at a time” and “clear them of these rats.”

Civilian deaths vs. genocide

Supporters of the intervention argued that Gadhafi’s use of the words “rats” and “cleans” resembled the genocidal language used by Hutu leaders and militias in Rwanda in 1994. Rwandan radio was calling on Hutus to “cut down the tall trees” and “crush the cockroaches.”

A month later, Gadhafi delivered another speech in which he made it clear that only those standing against him with arms would face reprisal.

“If you read [Gadhafi’s comments] closely, they were clearly directed only at the rebels who were going to stand and fight,” said Alan Kuperman, a public policy professor at the University of Texas who composed an exhaustive study on the Libyan civil war.

Paul: ‘Hillary’s War’

What is not in dispute is that the intelligence community’s assessment and the military leadership’s concerns were not given full credence, and that almost certainly will provide fodder to Mrs. Clinton’s critics to attack her leadership style.

“I think there was a rush headlong toward war in Libya and [the State Department and the administration] weren’t listening to anyone saying anything otherwise, including the Defense Department and intelligence communities, who were saying, ‘Hold on a minute. This may not be a good idea,’” said Sen. Rand Paul, Kentucky Republican and a presidential contender himself.

Merrill said in the meantime , Clinton 's team `` has worked with the State Department to ensure her emails are stored in a safe and secure manner . ''
The FBI , which is handling the matter , declined to comment Tuesday evening . David E. Kendall , Clinton 's lawyer , did not immediately return messages seeking comment .
A senior Clinton campaign aide said the server had n't yet changed hands as of Tuesday evening and Clinton 's team is working with the Justice Department to arrange the logistics of the handover . The thumb drive , meanwhile , has been turned over . And Kendall , the aide said , has followed State Department guidance on safekeeping .
Clinton 's campaign believes there are no emails from her State Department tenure on the server , since it was wiped clean after she turned over her work-related emails to the State Department , the aide said .
The aide said it 's the Clinton campaign 's understanding that the Justice Department is n't looking to reconstruct the server 's history , but is instead concerned about the security of the emails today , since some are now classified , though they were n't classified or labeled as such at the time .
For Clinton , the move -- which Republicans like House Speaker John Boehner have urged for months -- indicates her campaign sees a growing risk in the issue of her use of a private email server , which has stoked concerns about her trustworthiness .
`` It 's about time , '' Boehner said in a statement Tuesday night .
Since news broke in March of her use of a personal email address on a server kept in her Chappaqua , New York , home , Clinton has insisted that she 's turned over all of her work-related emails to the State Department and deleted all others -- but would n't turn over her server to the government .
Clinton has been dogged by poll numbers showing that more Americans , by a margin of about 20 percentage points , say she 's not trustworthy rather than trustworthy . A late July CNN/ORC poll found that 58 % of all registered voters say it is extremely important that the next president be honest and trustworthy .
Rep. Trey Gowdy , who chairs the House Select Committee on Benghazi and has pushed for Clinton 's emails for months , claimed credit for her decision to turn over the server .
`` The revelation that Secretary Clinton exclusively used private email for official public business , and the multitude of issues that emanated from her decision , including this most recent one , demonstrates what can happen when Congress and those equally committed to exposing the truth , doggedly pursue facts and follow them , '' he said in a statement .
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley , R-Iowa , said Clinton waited `` a long time '' before turning the server over .
`` That 's a long time for top secret classified information to be held by an unauthorized person outside of an approved , secure government facility , '' he said in a statement . `` I look forward to the FBI answering my questions so the American people can be assured that everything has been done to protect our national security interests and hold accountable anyone who broke the rules . ''

Still , it 's clear the GOP wo n't stop hitting Clinton on the campaign trail , accusing her of secrecy over her decision to wait five months to turn over the server .
Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement Tuesday night that releasing the server does little to answer questions about Clinton 's honesty .
`` If Hillary Clinton believed in honesty and transparency , she would have turned over her secret server months ago to an independent arbiter , not as a last resort and to the Obama Justice Department , '' he said . `` Of course , if she really cares about transparency , she would never have had a secret server in the first place . ''
Clinton 's decision to hand over the server comes as the intelligence community 's inspector general now says at least five emails stored on Clinton 's server contained classified information . The documents were from a `` limited sampling '' of her emails and among those 40 reviewed , said the inspector general , Charles McCullough III .
On Tuesday , McCullough sent four of the emails to chairs of several congressional committees . In a cover letter , he said two of the four emails included information that has now been classified up to top secret .
One of the five emails has since been declassified because it was no longer time-sensitive . The intelligence community maintains the remaining two contained classified material , but is deferring to the State Department on whether they should be identified as such .
McCullough said in the past that `` none of the emails we reviewed had classification or dissemination markings , '' but that some `` should have been handled as classified , appropriately marked , and transmitted via a secure network . '' The State Department has told McCullough that `` there are potentially hundreds of classified emails within the approximately 30,000 provided by former Secretary Clinton . ''
Republicans shared exclusively with CNN Tuesday a review of those emails that the State Department had released , which they said showed Clinton and her aides sent information that would later be classified to six people 's private email addresses . They include former Deputy Secretary of State Bill Burns ; Cheryl Mills , who was Clinton 's chief of staff at the State Department ; and Jake Sullivan , who served as Clinton 's top foreign policy adviser . Clinton also emailed information that would later be classified to close confidant Sidney Blumenthal , whose communications with Clinton about Libya have become a focus of the House committee investigating the 2012 Benghazi attacks .

`` The fact that classified information was sent to and from Hillary Clinton to at least six separate individuals and potentially many more demonstrates just how big of a risk her decision to use a secret server poses to our national security , '' Republican National Committee research director Raj Shah told CNN .
The probe into Clinton 's email practices has now expanded to include some of her top aides as part of a larger investigation on the use of private email accounts by previous secretaries of state . The Republican chairmen of three Senate committees -- intelligence , homeland security and foreign relations -- sent a joint request in March for both inspectors general to investigate the personal emails of Clinton 's aides .
`` We will follow the facts wherever they lead , to include former aides and associates , as appropriate , '' said Douglas Welty , a spokesman for the State Department 's inspector general .
In a July 17 letter to the State Department , Steve A. Linick , the State Department inspector general , said his office is reviewing `` the use of personal communications hardware and software by five secretaries of state and their immediate staffs . '' The Office of the Intelligence Community Inspector General is assisting in the review .
One of the emails containing since-classified information was released to the public , prompting the intelligence community to ask the FBI to investigate the possible compromise of classified material . The State Department now has a team of analysts from the intelligence community to review Clinton 's emails before any more are released to the public .
Of the two top-secret emails sent to Congress on Tuesday , State Department spokesman John Kirby said they have not been released to the public and the department is `` taking steps to ensure the information is protected and stored appropriately '' while the determination was made .
`` Department employees circulated these emails on unclassified systems in 2009 and 2011 , and ultimately some were forwarded to Secretary Clinton , '' Kirby said . `` They were not marked as classified . ''","Washington (CNN) Hillary Clinton agreed to turn over her private email server to authorities on Tuesday, the same day an intelligence community inspector general told congressional committees that at least five emails from the server did contain classified information.

The decision to hand over the server, as well as a thumb drive of all her work-related emails to the Justice Department, represents an effort to blunt an expanding probe into her use of a private email account.

Clinton, now the Democratic presidential front-runner, ""directed her team to give her email server that was used during her tenure as (secretary of state) to the Department of Justice, as well as a thumb drive containing copies of her emails already provided to the State Department,"" her spokesman, Nick Merrill, told CNN early Tuesday evening. ""She pledged to cooperate with the government's security inquiry, and if there are more questions, we will continue to address them.""

Merrill said in the meantime, Clinton's team ""has worked with the State Department to ensure her emails are stored in a safe and secure manner.""

The FBI, which is handling the matter, declined to comment Tuesday evening. David E. Kendall, Clinton's lawyer, did not immediately return messages seeking comment.

A senior Clinton campaign aide said the server hadn't yet changed hands as of Tuesday evening and Clinton's team is working with the Justice Department to arrange the logistics of the handover. The thumb drive, meanwhile, has been turned over. And Kendall, the aide said, has followed State Department guidance on safekeeping.

Clinton's campaign believes there are no emails from her State Department tenure on the server, since it was wiped clean after she turned over her work-related emails to the State Department, the aide said.

The aide said it's the Clinton campaign's understanding that the Justice Department isn't looking to reconstruct the server's history, but is instead concerned about the security of the emails today, since some are now classified, though they weren't classified or labeled as such at the time.

Boehner: 'It's about time'

For Clinton, the move -- which Republicans like House Speaker John Boehner have urged for months -- indicates her campaign sees a growing risk in the issue of her use of a private email server, which has stoked concerns about her trustworthiness.

""It's about time,"" Boehner said in a statement Tuesday night.

Since news broke in March of her use of a personal email address on a server kept in her Chappaqua, New York, home, Clinton has insisted that she's turned over all of her work-related emails to the State Department and deleted all others -- but wouldn't turn over her server to the government.

Clinton has been dogged by poll numbers showing that more Americans, by a margin of about 20 percentage points, say she's not trustworthy rather than trustworthy. A late July CNN/ORC poll found that 58% of all registered voters say it is extremely important that the next president be honest and trustworthy.

Rep. Trey Gowdy, who chairs the House Select Committee on Benghazi and has pushed for Clinton's emails for months, claimed credit for her decision to turn over the server.

""The revelation that Secretary Clinton exclusively used private email for official public business, and the multitude of issues that emanated from her decision, including this most recent one, demonstrates what can happen when Congress and those equally committed to exposing the truth, doggedly pursue facts and follow them,"" he said in a statement.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said Clinton waited ""a long time"" before turning the server over.

""That's a long time for top secret classified information to be held by an unauthorized person outside of an approved, secure government facility,"" he said in a statement. ""I look forward to the FBI answering my questions so the American people can be assured that everything has been done to protect our national security interests and hold accountable anyone who broke the rules.""

Still, it's clear the GOP won't stop hitting Clinton on the campaign trail, accusing her of secrecy over her decision to wait five months to turn over the server.

Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement Tuesday night that releasing the server does little to answer questions about Clinton's honesty.

""If Hillary Clinton believed in honesty and transparency, she would have turned over her secret server months ago to an independent arbiter, not as a last resort and to the Obama Justice Department,"" he said. ""Of course, if she really cares about transparency, she would never have had a secret server in the first place.""

Classified emails

Clinton's decision to hand over the server comes as the intelligence community's inspector general now says at least five emails stored on Clinton's server contained classified information. The documents were from a ""limited sampling"" of her emails and among those 40 reviewed, said the inspector general, Charles McCullough III.

On Tuesday, McCullough sent four of the emails to chairs of several congressional committees. In a cover letter, he said two of the four emails included information that has now been classified up to top secret.

One of the five emails has since been declassified because it was no longer time-sensitive. The intelligence community maintains the remaining two contained classified material, but is deferring to the State Department on whether they should be identified as such.

McCullough said in the past that ""none of the emails we reviewed had classification or dissemination markings,"" but that some ""should have been handled as classified, appropriately marked, and transmitted via a secure network."" The State Department has told McCullough that ""there are potentially hundreds of classified emails within the approximately 30,000 provided by former Secretary Clinton.""

Republicans shared exclusively with CNN Tuesday a review of those emails that the State Department had released, which they said showed Clinton and her aides sent information that would later be classified to six people's private email addresses. They include former Deputy Secretary of State Bill Burns; Cheryl Mills, who was Clinton's chief of staff at the State Department; and Jake Sullivan, who served as Clinton's top foreign policy adviser. Clinton also emailed information that would later be classified to close confidant Sidney Blumenthal, whose communications with Clinton about Libya have become a focus of the House committee investigating the 2012 Benghazi attacks.

""The fact that classified information was sent to and from Hillary Clinton to at least six separate individuals and potentially many more demonstrates just how big of a risk her decision to use a secret server poses to our national security,"" Republican National Committee research director Raj Shah told CNN.

Widening probe

The probe into Clinton's email practices has now expanded to include some of her top aides as part of a larger investigation on the use of private email accounts by previous secretaries of state. The Republican chairmen of three Senate committees -- intelligence, homeland security and foreign relations -- sent a joint request in March for both inspectors general to investigate the personal emails of Clinton's aides.

""We will follow the facts wherever they lead, to include former aides and associates, as appropriate,"" said Douglas Welty, a spokesman for the State Department's inspector general.

In a July 17 letter to the State Department, Steve A. Linick, the State Department inspector general, said his office is reviewing ""the use of personal communications hardware and software by five secretaries of state and their immediate staffs."" The Office of the Intelligence Community Inspector General is assisting in the review.

One of the emails containing since-classified information was released to the public, prompting the intelligence community to ask the FBI to investigate the possible compromise of classified material. The State Department now has a team of analysts from the intelligence community to review Clinton's emails before any more are released to the public.

Of the two top-secret emails sent to Congress on Tuesday, State Department spokesman John Kirby said they have not been released to the public and the department is ""taking steps to ensure the information is protected and stored appropriately"" while the determination was made.

""Department employees circulated these emails on unclassified systems in 2009 and 2011, and ultimately some were forwarded to Secretary Clinton,"" Kirby said. ""They were not marked as classified.""",www.cnn.com,left,i01LRKoQ3FtWzN7I

But let ’ s face it , whoever came after Hillary Clinton was going to have to deal with a foreign affairs press corps that has been sleeping for four years . From the moment Hillary entered Foggy Bottom , political reporters have treated their beloved secretary of state with kid gloves .
Watching media outlets now play catch-up on just how dangerous the world really is makes you feel a bit sorry for Kerry . Suddenly the State Department reporters have realized that Iran is about to get a nuclear weapon , GITMO is still open , North Korea is invigorated , the Russians are actively out-maneuvering us , Syria is in flames and the French are leading the fight against Al Qaeda .
The mainstream media decided long ago that Hillary Clinton was going to be a fabulous global leader regardless of how she performed . Liberal outlets from the New York Times to Foreign Policy magazine are now busy cleaning up Hillary ’ s failed record . Robert Mackey and Mark Landler of the Times have dutifully given Hillary a news makeover , while Foreign Policy magazine is out with a new piece blaming Obama for the foreign policy failures because he froze Hillary out .
Following Obama ’ s final election and with Hillary building toward one in 2016 , the media are giving their presumptive Democratic nominee all the successes and forcing Obama to fall on his sword for the failures .
The political press , like foreign policy reporters , has been all too willing to help Hillary build her global credentials by ignoring the world ’ s problems , and more importantly the fact that she did little to deal with them .

It just isn ’ t plausible for reporters to claim that so much fell apart in the one month John Kerry has been in charge at State .","John Kerry is going to have a rough tenure as secretary of state. But let’s face it, whoever came after Hillary Clinton was going to have to deal with a foreign affairs press corps that has been sleeping for four years. From the moment Hillary entered Foggy Bottom, political reporters have treated their beloved secretary of state with kid gloves.

Watching media outlets now play catch-up on just how dangerous the world really is makes you feel a bit sorry for Kerry. Suddenly the State Department reporters have realized that Iran is about to get a nuclear weapon, GITMO is still open, North Korea is invigorated, the Russians are actively out-maneuvering us, Syria is in flames and the French are leading the fight against Al Qaeda.

The mainstream media decided long ago that Hillary Clinton was going to be a fabulous global leader regardless of how she performed. Liberal outlets from the New York Times to Foreign Policy magazine are now busy cleaning up Hillary’s failed record. Robert Mackey and Mark Landler of the Times have dutifully given Hillary a news makeover, while Foreign Policy magazine is out with a new piece blaming Obama for the foreign policy failures because he froze Hillary out.

Following Obama’s final election and with Hillary building toward one in 2016, the media are giving their presumptive Democratic nominee all the successes and forcing Obama to fall on his sword for the failures.

The political press, like foreign policy reporters, has been all too willing to help Hillary build her global credentials by ignoring the world’s problems, and more importantly the fact that she did little to deal with them. Although secretary of state for just a month, Foreign Policy says John Kerry has already managed to ruin the U.S.-Russian relationship. The magazine’s headline: “Russian Foreign Minister Won’t Return Kerry’s Call” -- never mind that it was Hillary Clinton who spearheaded a “Russian reset” that emboldened Russian leaders.

Following Clinton’s antagonizing and patronizing Russian policy shift last December, when she accused Vladimir Putin of attempting to “re-Sovietize the region,” American and Russian leaders have publicly cited increased tensions between the two nations. Yet somehow it is Secretary Kerry’s fault that the Kremlin won’t return his phone calls.

Problems with Turkey’s Prime Minister Recep Erdogan, too, escalated during Clinton’s tenure at State. His anti-Israel rhetoric over the last four years certainly isn’t new. Yet Erdogan’s latest comments saying Zionism is a crime against humanity remind us of his actions during the Gaza Flotilla incident in 2010, in which a skirmish with Israeli commandoes left nine Turkish citizens dead.

Yet instead of helping the Israeli and Turkish governments weather the episode with relations intact, Secretary Clinton was notably absent from the international arena at the time, even skipping, along with Ambassador Susan Rice, the United Nations’ emergency session addressing the incident.

At times angry and choked with emotion , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Wednesday took on Republican critics of her department 's handling of the September terrorist attack in Libya that killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans , but repeatedly distanced herself from a direct role in specific situations .
`` As I have said many times since September 11 , I take responsibility , '' Clinton told two long-anticipated congressional hearings examining the attack that became a major issue in the November presidential election .
Conservative Republicans challenged Clinton on the lack of security at the diplomatic compound in Benghazi , where Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three others were killed , as well as the erroneous account provided four days later by U.N . Ambassador Susan Rice that the attack grew spontaneously from a protest over an anti-Islam film produced in the United States .
Sen. Ron Johnson , a tea party backed Wisconsin Republican serving his first term , persistently questioned Clinton on Wednesday morning about what he described as Rice `` purposely misleading '' the American people .
`` We were misled that there were supposedly protests and something sprang out of that , an assault sprang out of that and that was easily ascertained that that was not the fact , '' Johnson said , adding that `` the American people could have known that within days . ''

Shouting and gesturing with her arms in frustration , Clinton shot back : `` With all due respect , the fact is we had four dead Americans . Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night decided they 'd go kill some Americans ? ''
Her fists shaking , she continued : `` What difference , at this point , does it make ? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again , senator . ''
Later Johnson , interviewed by CNN 's Erin Burnett , said he still did not think Clinton answered his question .
`` The American people also have the right to be told the truth , '' said Johnson . `` They have an expectation that this administration , this president will be honest with them . And so it makes a big deal of difference . I 'll tell you what , I was surprised by Secretary Clinton 's reaction to that . ''
Another conservative , Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky , told Clinton she should have been fired for not reading cables from Stevens and others in Libya .
Later in the day , conservative GOP Rep. Jeff Duncan of South Carolina accused Clinton of `` national security malpractice '' by letting the Benghazi consulate `` become a death trap . ''
Duncan also questioned Clinton 's claim of taking responsibility , noting she still had her job and the State Department officials cited for culpability by an independent review also remained on the payroll , though on forced leave pending possible further steps .
At both hearings , which together totaled more than five hours , Clinton acknowledged the `` systemic breakdown '' cited by an Accountability Review Board she appointed and noted she had accepted all 29 of its recommendations , adding her department was taking additional steps to increase security at U.S. diplomatic facilities around the world .
However , she also told both the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and House Foreign Affairs Committee that she had no direct role in the handling of requests by Stevens and other diplomats for increased security that were denied , saying : `` I did n't see those requests . They did n't come to me . ''
In reference to the erroneous talking points by Rice that were aired on September 16 , Clinton told the Senate panel that she was focused at that time on ensuring the safety of U.S. personnel at other facilities where protests were taking place .
`` I was pretty occupied about keeping our people safe , doing what needed to be done , '' Clinton said , adding `` I was n't involved in the talking points process . ''
At one point , Clinton attempted to wrap up the issue , saying : `` If you wish to fault the administration , it 's that we did n't have a clear picture , and we probably did n't do as clear a job explaining that we did not have a clear picture , until days later , creating what I think are legitimate questions . ''
The independent report from the review board said it did not find `` that any individual U.S. government employee engaged in misconduct or willfully ignored his or her responsibilities '' leading up to the attack . However , one State Department official resigned and three others were placed on administrative leave after the report was released in December .
One of the GOP 's harshest critics of the administration over the Benghazi attack , Sen. John McCain of Arizona , called Clinton 's testimony unsatisfactory .
He said her department had yet to fully disclose all e-mails and other communication from Stevens and others in Benghazi , noting the American people , including the family and loved ones of those killed , deserved full answers .
Critics also complain the assailants remain at large , and Clinton noted that `` we continue to hunt the terrorists responsible for the attacks in Benghazi and are determined to bring them to justice . ''
She told Wednesday 's hearings that the FBI is pursuing what she called `` very positive leads . ''
In her opening statement to both panels , Clinton said the Benghazi attack did n't happen in a vacuum but was part of a `` broader strategic challenge in North Africa and the wider region . ''
She defended her department 's response , saying there was `` timely '' and `` exceptional '' coordination between the State Department and the Pentagon on the night of the attack
`` No delays in decision making . No denials of support from Washington or from the military , '' Clinton said . The review panel 's report `` said our response saved American lives in real time -- and it did , '' she added .
Clinton also said she directed the response to the attack from the State Department that night and `` stayed in close contact with officials from across our government and the Libyan government . ''
In addition , Clinton said she immediately took steps to beef up security at U.S. posts around the world and to implement the review panel 's 29 recommendations .
Clinton made clear that the security situation in North Africa and the Middle East remained threatening in the wake of the Arab Spring upheaval , with longtime leaders ousted in Egypt , Tunisia and Libya .
The fledgling Libyan leadership turned out to be unable to fulfill traditional security commitments to the U.S. diplomatic compound , she said .
`` What I found with the Libyans was willingness but not capacity , '' she said .
Clinton also warned that weapons from Libya have turned up in Algeria and elsewhere , adding that `` this Pandora 's Box if you will '' represented a major security threat .
`` The Arab Spring has ushered in a time when al Qaeda is on the rise , '' she said . `` The world in many ways is even more dangerous because we lack a central command [ in al Qaeda ] and have instead these nodes that are scattered throughout North Africa and other places . ''
Clinton expressed particular concern at events in Mali , where well-armed Tuareg militia , who had been working for former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi , came home just as al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb ( AQIM ) gravitated toward the area .
The size and topography of northern Mali , with its endless desert and caves , made for a long but necessary struggle , she said , adding that `` we can not permit northern Mali to become a safe haven . ''
Overall , she said , at least 20 U.S. diplomatic outposts `` are under a serious threat environment as I speak to you . ''
Wednesday 's committee appearances were some of the last acts for Clinton before she leaves her post as long planned , and Clinton showed a personal side in discussing what happened .
`` For me , this is not just a matter of policy , '' she told the Senate panel . `` It 's personal . ''
In reference to the return of remains of the four slain Americans , Clinton said in a voice choked with emotion : `` I stood next to President Obama as the Marines carried those flag-draped caskets off the plane at Andrews . I put my arms around the mothers and fathers , sisters and brothers , sons and daughters . ''

The back-and-forth stemmed from a Vox interview with President Barack Obama published Monday.

Story Continued Below

“It is entirely legitimate for the American people to be deeply concerned when you’ve got a bunch of violent, vicious zealots who behead people or randomly shoot a bunch of folks in a deli in Paris,” the president said.

Reporters in Tuesday’s White House briefing raised questions about Obama’s decision not to label the shooting an anti-Semitic incident.

“This was not a random shooting of a ‘bunch of folks,’” ABC’s Jon Karl said. “Does the president have any doubt that those terrorists attacked that deli because there would be Jews in that deli?”

“It is clear” what the motivation of the terrorists were, Earnest said.

“The adverb that the president chose was used to indicate that the individuals who were killed in that terrible, tragic incident were killed, not because of who they were, but because of where they randomly happened to be,” he said.

Karl asked again whether religion played into the location of the shooting.

“This individuals were not targeted by name. This is the point,” Earnest replied, adding, “there were people other than Jews who were in that deli.”

“I answered the question once. No,” Earnest replied when asked by Karl whether the president believed had any doubt that the deli was attacked because it was a kosher establishment.

A GOP leadership aide swiftly criticized Earnest’s remarks.

“Refusing to admit that the kosher deli in Paris was specifically targeted because it is a gathering place for Jews is just one reason why many people don’t trust the Obama administration when it comes to defending Israel,” the aide said.

In a subsequent State Department press briefing, spokeswoman Jen Psaki, asked about the exchange between Earnest and Karl, said that the victims did not come from one background or nationality.

Asked if the deli attack targeted the Jewish community, Psaki said: “I don’t think we’re going to speak on behalf of French authorities and what they believe was the situation at play here.”

Both the White House and French President Francois Hollande condemned the attacks as anti-Semitic at the time.

Calling the attack a “violent assault on the Jewish community,” White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough said on Jan. 13 that it “was the latest in a series of troubling incidents in Europe and around the world that reflect a rising tide of anti-Semitism.”

Clarifying her remarks, Psaki later tweeted Tuesday, “We have always been clear that the attack on the kosher grocery store was an anti-semitic attack that took the lives of innocent people.?”

Earnest also took to Twitter to underscore he agreed the shooting was an attack on the Jewish community.

State Department memo alleges a drug ring operated near the U.S. embassy in Iraq
Senior State Department and Diplomatic Security officials may have covered up or stopped investigations of inappropriate or even criminal misconduct by staff , according to an internal memo from the department 's Office of the Inspector General .
The timeline surrounding the allegations places the incidents during former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 's tenure , opening the possibility that a widening scandal might taint both her record and her possible political aspirations . Clinton has also taken heat for the department 's response to the September 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi , Libya .
The memo itself , purportedly written by Ambassador Larry Dinger , describes some of the information as coming from office chatter .
`` Sometimes the sources are one or more agents who became aware of the case from colleagues in what , given cubicles , can be a collegial environment , '' the memo says .

Regarding the latest allegations , CNN was provided the documents by a lawyer for a whistle-blower who is a former senior inspector general investigator .
• An active U.S. ambassador `` routinely ditched his protective security detail in order to solicit sexual favors from both prostitutes and minor children , '' the memo says . The ambassador 's protective detail and others `` were well aware of the behavior , '' the memo asserts . When a diplomatic security officer tried to investigate , undersecretary of state for management Patrick Kennedy allegedly ordered the investigator `` not to open a formal investigation . ''
On Tuesday , CNN obtained a statement from the ambassador , who vigorously denied the allegations , calling them `` baseless . ''
A source close to the investigation of the ambassador told CNN that the ambassador 's security detail reported to the inspector general that the ambassador would leave his house at night without notifying the detail . The detail followed the ambassador and saw the ambassador once go to a park that 's known for illegal activity , the source told CNN . The detail said they never witnessed the ambassador engage in any sexual activity , the source said .
The ambassador went to Washington and was asked what he was doing and he denied any wrongdoing , the source told CNN . The ambassador explained that sometimes he fights with his wife , needs air and he goes for a walk in the park because he likes it .
Kennedy also issued a statement Tuesday , saying it is his responsibility `` to make sure the department and all of our employees -- no matter their rank -- are held to the highest standard , and I have never once interfered , nor would I condone interfering , in any investigation . ''
• A State Department security official in Beirut allegedly `` engaged in sexual assaults '' against foreign nationals working as embassy guards .

State Department memo alleges a drug ring operated near the U.S. embassy in Iraq

An ambassador allegedly engaged prostitutes, a memo says

Investigations into the allegations, in some cases, were stymied

Senior State Department and Diplomatic Security officials may have covered up or stopped investigations of inappropriate or even criminal misconduct by staff, according to an internal memo from the department's Office of the Inspector General.

The timeline surrounding the allegations places the incidents during former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's tenure, opening the possibility that a widening scandal might taint both her record and her possible political aspirations . Clinton has also taken heat for the department's response to the September 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya.

The memo itself, purportedly written by Ambassador Larry Dinger, describes some of the information as coming from office chatter.

""Sometimes the sources are one or more agents who became aware of the case from colleagues in what, given cubicles, can be a collegial environment,"" the memo says.

Regarding the latest allegations, CNN was provided the documents by a lawyer for a whistle-blower who is a former senior inspector general investigator.

They include:

• An active U.S. ambassador ""routinely ditched his protective security detail in order to solicit sexual favors from both prostitutes and minor children,"" the memo says. The ambassador's protective detail and others ""were well aware of the behavior,"" the memo asserts. When a diplomatic security officer tried to investigate, undersecretary of state for management Patrick Kennedy allegedly ordered the investigator ""not to open a formal investigation.""

On Tuesday, CNN obtained a statement from the ambassador, who vigorously denied the allegations, calling them ""baseless.""

A source close to the investigation of the ambassador told CNN that the ambassador's security detail reported to the inspector general that the ambassador would leave his house at night without notifying the detail. The detail followed the ambassador and saw the ambassador once go to a park that's known for illegal activity, the source told CNN. The detail said they never witnessed the ambassador engage in any sexual activity, the source said.

The ambassador went to Washington and was asked what he was doing and he denied any wrongdoing, the source told CNN. The ambassador explained that sometimes he fights with his wife, needs air and he goes for a walk in the park because he likes it.

Kennedy also issued a statement Tuesday, saying it is his responsibility ""to make sure the department and all of our employees -- no matter their rank -- are held to the highest standard, and I have never once interfered, nor would I condone interfering, in any investigation.""

• A State Department security official in Beirut allegedly ""engaged in sexual assaults"" against foreign nationals working as embassy guards. The security official, the Office of the Inspector General says, was also accused of committing ""similar assaults during assignments in Baghdad, and possibly Khartoum and Monrovia."" The office's memo says that an inspector general's investigator who went to Beirut to try to conduct an investigation was not given enough time to complete the job.

• A member of Clinton's security detail allegedly ""engaged prostitutes while on official trips in foreign countries."" The inspector general's agent assigned to investigate ""concluded"" that the ""prostitution problem was endemic.""

• In Iraq, an ""underground drug ring"" may have been operating near the U.S. Embassy and ""supplying"" drugs to State Department security contractors, but an agent sent to investigate the allegations was prevented from completing the job.

The allegations were first reported Monday by CBS.

State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki responded Monday.

""We hold all employees to the highest standards,"" she said. ""We take allegations of misconduct seriously and we investigate thoroughly. All cases mentioned in the CBS report were thoroughly investigated and under investigation, and the department continues to take action.""

During a Tuesday State briefing with reporters, Psaki reiterated that the memo contains ""unsubstantiated allegations"" and that some cases are ongoing and some are closed. But she would not, though repeatedly pressed by reporters, specify exactly which ones were open or closed.

""As a matter of policy, I'm not going to talk"" about specific cases, she said.

""We take every allegation seriously,"" Psaki added. ""We are seeing through the process.""

On Tuesday, Nicholas Merrill, a spokesman for Hillary Clinton, said Clinton was completely unaware of any of the investigations mentioned in the Office of the Inspector General's reports and memos, including the case involving her personal security detail allegedly soliciting prostitutes.

""We learned of it from the media and don't know anything beyond what's been reported,"" Merrill told CNN in a written statement.

Clinton officially left her post in February.

Also Tuesday, U.S. Rep. Ed Royce, R-California, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said he has asked his staff to begin an investigation into the allegations, and sent a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry demanding an explanation.

""The notion that any or all of these cases would not be investigated thoroughly by the Department is unacceptable,"" Royce wrote in his letter to Kerry.

CNN obtained a draft, dated December 2012, of a report by the inspector general's office evaluating the performance of the department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security Special Investigations Division.

The report says that the bureau ""lacks a firewall"" that would preclude higher-ups from ""exercising undue influence in particular cases.""

The bureau doesn't have a manual with approved guidelines on how to investigate cases, the report also says. Investigators with the inspector general's office ""discovered uncertainty"" among state agents about how to conduct thorough investigations, and noted that not going through the proper mechanisms can ""ruin"" a potential criminal investigation.

The report also calls the department's Criminal Investigations Division ""unwieldy"" and says that ""frequent agent turnover"" makes it harder for the Bureau of Diplomatic Security to conduct investigations.

The inspector general's office published a February 2013 final report whose key findings are, largely, the same as stated in the December 2012 draft.

The division's current management structure, the report says, does not ""foster independence from career pressures and creates significant potential for undue influence, favoritism, and potential retribution.",www.cnn.com,left,tXPm2Qryr8PUz57F

state_department,CNN (Web News),0,http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/29/politics/state-department-to-release-clinton-emails/index.html,State Department will not release 22 'top secret' Clinton emails,2016-01-29,Laura Koran,"( CNN ) The State Department announced Friday that it will not release 22 emails from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton because they contain `` top secret '' information , the highest level of government classification .
The decision , coming three days before the Iowa caucuses , could provide fodder for Clinton 's political opponents , especially Republicans , who are likely to make note of the emails ' `` top secret '' designation . Clinton 's email use has haunted her on the campaign trail since it became public early last year that she maintained a private server while leading the State Department .
State Department spokesman John Kirby said the documents , totaling 37 pages , were not marked classified at the time they were sent , but are being upgraded at the request of the Intelligence Community because they contain sensitive information .
But , Kirby said , a separate review by the bureaus of Diplomatic Security and Intelligence and Research is being held into whether the information in the emails was classified at the time they were sent and received . He would not say when the review began or how long it would go , and acknowledged it 's possible there could be classified emails that were n't marked as such .
`` It 's certainly possible that for any number of reasons , traffic can be sent that 's not marked appropriately for its classification . That is certainly possible , '' Kirby said .
But he added that he was n't going to make any judgments about this particular case .
`` All I can tell you definitively is it was n't marked classified at the time it was sent , '' Kirby said .
A senior State Department official said the review `` began very recently '' and was initiated by the State Department , but the official would n't say what prompted it .
A spokesperson for the Intelligence Community 's inspector general declined to comment .
Kirby also said 18 emails , comprised of eight email chains between Clinton and President Barack Obama , are being `` withheld in full '' to `` protect the President 's ability to receive unvarnished advice and counsel . '' But , Kirby said , they `` have not been determined to be classified '' and said they will `` ultimately be released in accordance with the Presidential records act . ''
Clinton did not mention the email controversy during campaign events Friday . But in an interview with KCRG in Dubuque , Iowa , Clinton maintained that she `` never emailed anything that was considered to be classified '' and asked for the emails to be released .
`` I 'd love for people to see what I did and I hope that will happen , '' she said .
Brian Fallon , a spokesman for Clinton 's campaign , said in a statement that Friday 's announcement was a case of `` over-classification run amok '' and reiterated Clinton 's position that the emails be made public .
But later Friday , Fallon declined to say whether Clinton would ask Obama to declassify the emails when pressed by CNN 's Wolf Blitzer on `` The Situation Room . ''
`` The President easily could declassify all of these emails if she asked him and if he agreed , right ? '' Blitzer asked .
`` I 'd really be surprised if this has risen to the President 's level , '' Fallon replied . `` Because , again , this a mundane matter of fulfilling a FOIA request . ''
Asked Friday if he had `` certainty and confidence '' that Clinton will not be indicted over the email controversy , White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said any decision to prosecute Clinton would rest with the Justice Department .
`` That is a decision to be made solely by independent prosecutors , '' Earnest said . `` But again , based on what we know from the Department of Justice , it does not seem to be headed in that direction . ''
The State Department released more than 900 of Clinton 's emails Friday -- 242 of which received classification upgrades : 11 to `` secret '' and 209 more to `` confidential , '' along with the 22 emails containing `` top secret '' information -- but the release fell well behind the judge-imposed timetable for producing all of her emails .
Clinton seeking to confirm with her team that a piece of information , which top aide Jake Sullivan described as proof the new Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications was doing its job , was `` not classified or otherwise inappropriate '' and fit to share with a reporter ;
Evidence that Clinton actively lobbied on behalf of the Affordable Care Act -- at one point , she emailed Miguel Rodriguez , then the director of the White House Office of Legislative Affairs , to inform him she 'd spoken and received a `` yes '' from then-Arkansas Rep. Marion Berry .
John Podesta , now the chairman of Clinton 's campaign , emailing aide Cheryl Mills to ask if she had a personal email to which he could send a message hours ahead of a meeting with then-chief of staff Rahm Emanuel .
Clinton asking , `` So , can someone sign just my first name ? '' when presented with a farewell letter ( written by Huma Abedin ) to former Sen. George Mitchell as he prepared to leave after two years as the top U.S. envoy to the Israelis and Palestinians .
The emails have been publishing over the last eight months more or less in accordance with a schedule set by Judge Rudolph Contreras , with increasingly large batches uploaded to a State Department website at the end of each month .
This month 's release was supposed to be the final one and include just over 9,000 pages of documents -- the largest number to date .
But last Thursday , the State Department filed a motion to extend the final productions until February 29 because the department had failed to send more than 7,000 pages of those emails to other government agencies for review , only recognizing the mistake earlier this month .
That delay was then compounded by a huge snowstorm that shut down the federal government for several days , according to the State Department 's motion .
Several prominent Republicans , including presidential hopefuls , quickly condemned Clinton , the Democratic 2016 front-runner , over Friday 's developments .
`` The new e-mail release is a disaster for Hillary Clinton . At a minimum , how can someone with such bad ( judgment ) be our next president ? '' GOP front-runner Donald Trump tweeted .
The new e-mail release is a disaster for Hillary Clinton . At a minimum , how can someone with such bad judgement be our next president ? — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) January 29 , 2016
Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said Clinton 's email use was a `` disqualifier '' for the White House .
`` Hillary Clinton put some of the highest , most sensitive intelligence information on her private server because maybe she thinks she 's above the law , '' Rubio said at a town hall event in Clinton , Iowa .
Texas Sen. Ted Cruz told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt that Clinton 's email controversy would seriously imperil her presidential aspirations .
`` We are talking about serious offenses for which the Obama Justice Department threw the book at General ( David ) Petraeus , '' Cruz said . `` And justice needs to be enforced fairly and impartially . ''
And Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus tweeted that Clinton and the Obama administration have `` obfuscated and misled at every available opportunity , '' adding that she has `` removed all doubt that she can not be trusted with the presidency . ''
With even more `` top-secret '' emails on her secret server , Clinton has removed all doubt that she can not be trusted with the presidency — Reince Priebus ( @ Reince ) January 29 , 2016
But Rep. Adam Schiff , D-California , the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee , said classification determinations `` are often very complex . ''
`` It 's important to remember that none of these emails had any classification markings at the time they were sent , and Secretary Clinton and her staff were responding to world events in real time without the benefit of months of analysis after the fact , '' Schiff said .
Meanwhile , Clinton 's top Democratic 2016 rival , Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders , said in a statement that `` there is a legal process in place which should proceed and not be politicized . ''
`` The voters of Iowa and this nation deserve a serious discussion of the issues facing them , '' Sanders said , and referenced the Democratic debate in October , when he memorably declined to attack Clinton over the issue .
`` The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails , '' he said then to applause .","(CNN) The State Department announced Friday that it will not release 22 emails from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton because they contain ""top secret"" information, the highest level of government classification.

He would not say when the review began or how long it would go, and acknowledged it's possible there could be classified emails that weren't marked as such.

""It's certainly possible that for any number of reasons, traffic can be sent that's not marked appropriately for its classification. That is certainly possible,"" Kirby said.

But he added that he wasn't going to make any judgments about this particular case.

""All I can tell you definitively is it wasn't marked classified at the time it was sent,"" Kirby said.

A senior State Department official said the review ""began very recently"" and was initiated by the State Department, but the official wouldn't say what prompted it.

A spokesperson for the Intelligence Community's inspector general declined to comment.

Kirby also said 18 emails, comprised of eight email chains between Clinton and President Barack Obama, are being ""withheld in full"" to ""protect the President's ability to receive unvarnished advice and counsel."" But, Kirby said, they ""have not been determined to be classified"" and said they will ""ultimately be released in accordance with the Presidential records act.""

'Over-classification run amok'

Clinton did not mention the email controversy during campaign events Friday. But in an interview with KCRG in Dubuque, Iowa , Clinton maintained that she ""never emailed anything that was considered to be classified"" and asked for the emails to be released.

""I'd love for people to see what I did and I hope that will happen,"" she said.

Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Clinton's campaign, said in a statement that Friday's announcement was a case of ""over-classification run amok"" and reiterated Clinton's position that the emails be made public.

But later Friday, Fallon declined to say whether Clinton would ask Obama to declassify the emails when pressed by CNN's Wolf Blitzer on ""The Situation Room.""

""The President easily could declassify all of these emails if she asked him and if he agreed, right?"" Blitzer asked.

""I'd really be surprised if this has risen to the President's level,"" Fallon replied. ""Because, again, this a mundane matter of fulfilling a FOIA request.""

Asked Friday if he had ""certainty and confidence"" that Clinton will not be indicted over the email controversy, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said any decision to prosecute Clinton would rest with the Justice Department.

""That is a decision to be made solely by independent prosecutors,"" Earnest said. ""But again, based on what we know from the Department of Justice, it does not seem to be headed in that direction.""

More emails released

The State Department released more than 900 of Clinton's emails Friday -- 242 of which received classification upgrades: 11 to ""secret"" and 209 more to ""confidential,"" along with the 22 emails containing ""top secret"" information -- but the release fell well behind the judge-imposed timetable for producing all of her emails.

Among the most interesting correspondence:

Clinton seeking to confirm with her team that a piece of information, which top aide Jake Sullivan described as proof the new Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications was doing its job, was ""not classified or otherwise inappropriate"" and fit to share with a reporter;

Evidence that Clinton actively lobbied on behalf of the Affordable Care Act -- at one point, she emailed Miguel Rodriguez, then the director of the White House Office of Legislative Affairs, to inform him she'd spoken and received a ""yes"" from then-Arkansas Rep. Marion Berry.

John Podesta, now the chairman of Clinton's campaign, emailing aide Cheryl Mills to ask if she had a personal email to which he could send a message hours ahead of a meeting with then-chief of staff Rahm Emanuel.

Clinton asking, ""So, can someone sign just my first name?"" when presented with a farewell letter (written by Huma Abedin) to former Sen. George Mitchell as he prepared to leave after two years as the top U.S. envoy to the Israelis and Palestinians.

The emails have been publishing over the last eight months more or less in accordance with a schedule set by Judge Rudolph Contreras, with increasingly large batches uploaded to a State Department website at the end of each month.

This month's release was supposed to be the final one and include just over 9,000 pages of documents -- the largest number to date.

But last Thursday, the State Department filed a motion to extend the final productions until February 29 because the department had failed to send more than 7,000 pages of those emails to other government agencies for review, only recognizing the mistake earlier this month.

That delay was then compounded by a huge snowstorm that shut down the federal government for several days, according to the State Department's motion.

Republicans pounce

Several prominent Republicans, including presidential hopefuls, quickly condemned Clinton, the Democratic 2016 front-runner, over Friday's developments.

""The new e-mail release is a disaster for Hillary Clinton. At a minimum, how can someone with such bad (judgment) be our next president?"" GOP front-runner Donald Trump tweeted.

The new e-mail release is a disaster for Hillary Clinton. At a minimum, how can someone with such bad judgement be our next president? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2016

Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said Clinton's email use was a ""disqualifier"" for the White House.

""Hillary Clinton put some of the highest, most sensitive intelligence information on her private server because maybe she thinks she's above the law,"" Rubio said at a town hall event in Clinton, Iowa.

Texas Sen. Ted Cruz told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt that Clinton's email controversy would seriously imperil her presidential aspirations.

""We are talking about serious offenses for which the Obama Justice Department threw the book at General (David) Petraeus,"" Cruz said. ""And justice needs to be enforced fairly and impartially.""

And Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus tweeted that Clinton and the Obama administration have ""obfuscated and misled at every available opportunity,"" adding that she has ""removed all doubt that she cannot be trusted with the presidency.""

With even more ""top-secret"" emails on her secret server, Clinton has removed all doubt that she cannot be trusted with the presidency — Reince Priebus (@Reince) January 29, 2016

But Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said classification determinations ""are often very complex.""

""It's important to remember that none of these emails had any classification markings at the time they were sent, and Secretary Clinton and her staff were responding to world events in real time without the benefit of months of analysis after the fact,"" Schiff said.

Meanwhile, Clinton's top Democratic 2016 rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, said in a statement that ""there is a legal process in place which should proceed and not be politicized.""

""The voters of Iowa and this nation deserve a serious discussion of the issues facing them,"" Sanders said, and referenced the Democratic debate in October , when he memorably declined to attack Clinton over the issue.

""The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails,"" he said then to applause.",www.cnn.com,left,1VtT8AyviVnGyEVk

Then , from of all places , her former place of employment — the State Department — suddenly injected new life into the scandal on July 1 by announcing that a significant number of her private stash of emails contained classified information .
That made her exclusive use of an unsecured , at-home server during her tenure as secretary of state a far more serious affair . As The ███ reported that day , government regulations mandate that officials conduct an inquiry to judge the lengths to which the secrets were disseminated , including inspecting her server and other media devices .
The first steps toward that possible outcome became public July 24 , when two inspectors general issued statements chastising Mrs. Clinton , the Democratic presidential front-runner , for keeping secrets on an unprotected server .
According to a point-by-point analysis , the inspectors ’ memos directly contradict Mrs. Clinton ’ s explanation for months on how she operated her email account to conduct State Department business instead of a State.gov address like every other employee .
Mrs. Clinton and her backers repeatedly have said she did not circulate classified information while secretary of state , and if there were such information , it was not secret during her 2009-2013 tenure .
But a memo from I. Charles McCullough III , the inspector general for the U.S. intelligence community , and a joint statement by he and the State Department IG , said information stored on the server was classified at the time it was disseminated .
Mrs. Clinton has said in interviews that she followed all government rules in her unusual email arrangement .
But again , the IG said in his memo to Congress that classified information in her emails should never have been stored on an unsecure , private server . In other words , he suggests she violated the procedures for handling classified information , a failing that can result in government workers being reprimanded or criminally charged .
A day after the IGs spoke out on July 24 , Mrs. Clinton clung to her explanation , saying the investigators were wrong and nothing was classified at the time .
But several days later , her traveling press secretary , Nick Merrill , did not repeat that defense when asked by The Times to respond to specification allegations made by IG investigators .
Mr. Merrill said : “ We have had a chance to review the statement released by the Inspectors General of the State Department and Intelligence Community outlining their concerns with regard to the State Department ’ s review and release of Hillary Clinton ’ s work emails . We want to ensure that appropriate procedures are followed as these emails are reviewed while not unduly delaying the release of her emails . We particularly do not want their release to be hampered by bureaucratic infighting among the Intelligence Community . More emails are slated to be released by the State Department next week , and we hope that release is as inclusive as possible . ”
Mrs. Clinton ’ s reliance on a server kept at her home in Chappaqua , New York , could prompt a formal investigation by the FBI ’ s Counterintelligence Division , which handles cases of unauthorized disclosures of government secrets .
Thomas Fitton , president of the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch , told The ███ there is sufficient indication of wrongdoing for Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch to appoint a special prosecutor .
“ Loretta Lynch should appoint a special prosecutor immediately , ” said Mr. Fitton , who has sued the administration to force the release of documents . “ The Obama Justice Department is conflicted , and the alleged crimes and cover-up not only implicate Mrs. Clinton but other senior administration officials , including Secretary of State [ John F. ] Kerry and lawyers in the Justice Department . Even President Obama and the White House have been sketchy on what they knew about Mrs. Clinton ’ s email system . The public interest demands a serious and independent criminal investigation . ”
P.J . Crowley , Mrs. Clinton ’ s spokesman during the first year of her tenure at the State Department , said Republicans risk losing voters if they make her emails a big campaign issue .
“ I would like to think the American people will want to hear more about the state of the economy , the cost of health care and the security of the homeland , ” Mr. Crowley said . “ If their big issue is the fact she used a private network to email her staff , I like her chances in the general election . ”
Mrs. Clinton has said she used her private server as a convenience instead of having to tote around two devices , one for herself and one for State.gov .
But security experts said the arrangement might have hand-delivered damaging information to U.S. enemies who know how to hack computer networks .
“ It is equivalent to leaving classified docs stacked in the middle of a public library , ” said Larry Johnson , a former CIA analyst and an expert on handling classified information . “ It makes us more vulnerable to foreign threats . ”
Mr. McCullough , a former FBI agent and longtime intelligence community official , sent a formal security referral to the FBI last month requesting an investigation for “ potential compromise of classified information . ”
That politically charged decision — a Democratic administration investigating the email practices of the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination — ultimately rests with Ms. Lynch .
The two-page referral is stamped “ official use only. ” The Office of the Director of National Intelligence ( DNI ) was in the process of sanitizing the two pages for release , but then handed it off to the Justice Department . An FBI spokesman referred a reporter to the Justice Department , which did not respond to queries . The referral could shed more light on the type of classified information contained in Mrs. Clinton ’ s emails .
Mr. McCullough and his counterpart at State , Inspector General Steve Linick , issued two statements that greatly changed the debate on Mrs. Clinton ’ s private emails .
Her personal email messaging was not known publicly until the House Select Committee on Benghazi pressed State to turn over her emails . The reply came back that they resided with her , not with a State server .
Mrs. Clinton then unilaterally reviewed thousands of emails and turned over about 30,000 to State in December 2014 . She says she wiped the server clean of thousands more that presumably will never be disclosed .
A State spokesman said on July 1 that about two dozen emails in the first tranche released under the Freedom of Information Act contained classified information . But he said he did not know if the information would have been classified at the time .
Last Friday , the count increased as State released another tranche in which 37 emails had to be cleansed of classified material .
On the campaign trail , Mrs. Clinton has been sending this message : “ I think there ’ s so much confusion around this that I understand why reporters and the public are asking questions , but the facts are pretty clear . I did not send nor receive anything that was classified at the time . ”
After The New York Times broke the story on the McCullough referral , Mr. Merrill , Mrs. Clinton ’ s traveling press secretary , sent out a tweet that said : “ She followed appropriate practices in dealing with classified materials . As has been reported on multiple occasions , any released emails deemed classified by the administration have been done so after the fact , and not at the time they were transmitted . ”
But IG McCullough directly contradicts that assertion in his July 23 memo to leaders of Congress ’ House and Senate intelligence committees .
“ We note that none of the emails we reviewed had classified or dissemination markings , but some included [ intelligence community- ] derived classified information and should have been handled as classified , appropriately marked and transmitted via a secure network . Further , my office ’ s limited sampling of 40 of the emails revealed four contained classified IC information which should have been marked and handled at the SECRET level . ”
A subsequent joint statement by Mr. McCullough and Mr. Linick said : “ These emails were not retroactively classified by the State Department ; rather these emails contained classified information when they were generated and , according to IC Classification officials , that information remains classified today . ”
At a March press conference , Mrs. Clinton asserted she “ fully complied with every rule ” in maintaining her private server for official business .
But the joint IG statement said she did not follow the rules . “ This classified information should never have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system , ” the two said .
Previously , a State Department official appointed by President Obama told a Senate committee that Mrs. Clinton ’ s email practice was “ not acceptable . ”
“ I think that the actions we ’ ve taken in the course of recovering these emails have made it very clear what people ’ s responsibilities are with respect to record keeping , ” Assistant Secretary of State for Administration Joyce Barr told the Senate Judiciary Committee . “ I think the message is loud and clear that that is not acceptable . ”
State Department bureaucrats appear to be going to bat for Mrs. Clinton in a battle with Mr. McCullough .
• Mr. McCullough and the State inspector general asked State to provide a copy of the 30,000 emails .
State agreed to limited access for the State IG , but flatly refused to provide the emails to Mr. McCullough ’ s office .
• State already has released classified information in the Clinton emails “ as a result of insufficient coordination with the intelligence community. ” State personnel “ continue to deny the classified character of released information despite a definitive determination from ” the intelligence community .
• Mr. McCullough ’ s office recommended that State conduct the review of 30,000 Clinton emails on a top secret computer network , but State said it does not have sufficient resources .
• The 30,000 Clinton emails were downloaded to an unsecure thumb drive in the possession of her personal attorney , David Kendall .
To date , State has released only a small portion of those emails in response to a judge ’ s order that it quicken the process in response to Freedom of Information Act lawsuits .

state_department,CBN,2,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2016/march/isis-genocide-will-us-back-up-its-tough-talk,ISIS Genocide: Will US Back Up Its Tough Talk?,2016-03-18,,"WASHINGTON -- While the Obama administration 's decision to designate ISIS 's atrocities against Christians and other minorities as `` genocide '' is important , many warn that it 's only the beginning of the process .
`` In my judgment Daesh is responsible for genocide against groups in territory under its control , '' Kerry said , using the Arabic acronym for the jihadist army .
It 's a critical first step towards protecting Christians from ISIS and other Islamic radicals in Iraq and Syria .
`` Every jihadist in the Middle East believes they can kill , kidnap , enslave and otherwise torture Christians and other religious minorities and they believe they can do it without repercussions , '' said Johnnie Moore , author of the book Defying ISIS .
In northern Iraq , Assyrian Christians are an ancient people descended from the first followers of Christ .
`` As Assyrians of the Middle East we are on the verge of extinction , '' warned Juliana Taimoorazy , founder and president of the Iraqi Christian Relief Council , an organization that raises awareness about the persecuted Church in Iraq .
Taimoorazy recently visited Telskuf in the Nineveh Plains of Iraq , where 200,000 Christians have fled from ISIS .
`` The homes are destroyed when you walk inside , '' she said . `` Their closets are all broken , the beds are all overturned - the kitchens are destroyed . ''
Secretary Kerry 's genocide designation helps keep the plight of these Christians near the front of U.S. foreign policy .
Advocates wasted no time celebrating . They 're already working with the State Department to ensure Christians are represented in Syrian peace talks and that property rights for those forced to flee their homes in Iraq are enforced .
`` There are going to be borders redrawn , constitutions redrafted , '' Nina Shea , a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute , told ███ News .
`` It 's absolutely essential that the Christians have a voice in this process or they will have no place in the new Syria or in the new Iraq , '' she warned .
There 's already an effort to create a safe haven in the Nineveh Plains so that Christians , Yazidis and other minorities can return home , govern themselves and rebuild their lives without fear of extermination .
`` If you care about the presence of Christianity , the Christian witness , in this very Gospel poor part of the world you will support the idea of a safe haven , '' Robert Nicholson , executive director of the Philos Project , told ███ News .
In spite of the horrors they 've experienced at the hands of ISIS , Christians in this part of the world are experiencing a revival of their faith .
`` They have told me repeatedly it 's because of persecution that has been inflicted on them that they have grown closer to Christ that they find themselves praying more that they 're thirsty for the Gospel more , '' Taimoorazy said .
Now the same advocates who pushed for the genocide designation are moving to keep up the pressure , hoping to ensure the Obama administration not only talks , but acts to protect those persecuted Christians and other religious minorities .
They hope to make real progress before the next administration moves into the White House .","WASHINGTON -- While the Obama administration's decision to designate ISIS's atrocities against Christians and other minorities as ""genocide"" is important, many warn that it's only the beginning of the process.

Secretary of State John Kerry made the announcement Thursday.

""In my judgment Daesh is responsible for genocide against groups in territory under its control,"" Kerry said, using the Arabic acronym for the jihadist army.

It's a critical first step towards protecting Christians from ISIS and other Islamic radicals in Iraq and Syria.

""Every jihadist in the Middle East believes they can kill, kidnap, enslave and otherwise torture Christians and other religious minorities and they believe they can do it without repercussions,"" said Johnnie Moore, author of the book Defying ISIS.

In northern Iraq, Assyrian Christians are an ancient people descended from the first followers of Christ.

""As Assyrians of the Middle East we are on the verge of extinction,"" warned Juliana Taimoorazy, founder and president of the Iraqi Christian Relief Council, an organization that raises awareness about the persecuted Church in Iraq.

Taimoorazy recently visited Telskuf in the Nineveh Plains of Iraq, where 200,000 Christians have fled from ISIS.

""The homes are destroyed when you walk inside,"" she said. ""Their closets are all broken, the beds are all overturned - the kitchens are destroyed.""

Secretary Kerry's genocide designation helps keep the plight of these Christians near the front of U.S. foreign policy.

Advocates wasted no time celebrating. They're already working with the State Department to ensure Christians are represented in Syrian peace talks and that property rights for those forced to flee their homes in Iraq are enforced.

""There are going to be borders redrawn, constitutions redrafted,"" Nina Shea, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, told CBN News.

""It's absolutely essential that the Christians have a voice in this process or they will have no place in the new Syria or in the new Iraq,"" she warned.

There's already an effort to create a safe haven in the Nineveh Plains so that Christians, Yazidis and other minorities can return home, govern themselves and rebuild their lives without fear of extermination.

""If you care about the presence of Christianity, the Christian witness, in this very Gospel poor part of the world you will support the idea of a safe haven,"" Robert Nicholson, executive director of the Philos Project, told CBN News.

In spite of the horrors they've experienced at the hands of ISIS, Christians in this part of the world are experiencing a revival of their faith.

""They have told me repeatedly it's because of persecution that has been inflicted on them that they have grown closer to Christ that they find themselves praying more that they're thirsty for the Gospel more,"" Taimoorazy said.

Now the same advocates who pushed for the genocide designation are moving to keep up the pressure, hoping to ensure the Obama administration not only talks, but acts to protect those persecuted Christians and other religious minorities.

They hope to make real progress before the next administration moves into the White House.",www1.cbn.com,right,S5jdkLsxTIlQ8wQ5

A State Department investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ’ s private email account found no widespread effort by her aides or other staffers to mishandle classified information . The three-year-long investigation by State ’ s Bureau of Diplomatic Security concluded that 38 individuals committed a total of 91 security violations involving emails sent to or from Clinton ’ s private server ...

With media navel-gazing in full swing , featuring another round of journalists ritually flagellating themselves for not doing more to prevent a Trump presidency , a top CNN legal analyst pronounced himself regretful for covering the email scandal with the frequency and seriousness that he did :

Toobin told POLITICO he has been flooded with responses since his surprise admission Monday morning on CNN . The feedback has largely fallen into two categories , he said : “ Thank you for saying this ” and “ You ’ re a jerk , you should n't have done it in the first place . ”
Apparently , the 'flood ' of responses from CNN viewers did not include anyone passing along the correct reaction , based on the facts : Namely , that Hillary Clinton 's email misconduct was , in fact , a bona fide scandal that warranted intense scrutiny .

She went through an enormous amount of trouble to set up a bootleg , woefully under-secured email server , on which she conducted official business -- including quite a lot of classified business .

( 2 ) Of course her ceaseless lying about the whole matter contributes to her culpability . Mrs. Clinton lied repeatedly about her emails , including lies about why she set up the private server in the first place , lies regarding classification markings , and lies about whether any of her 32,000 permanently-deleted emails were work-related ( we know for a fact that a significant number were , and some were even classified ) . Excluding the deleted content , more than 2,000 emails on Clinton 's server contained classified material , including dozens at the `` secret '' or `` top secret '' levels ( and even above top secret ) .

state_department,Reuters,1,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-tillerson/trump-fires-chief-diplomat-tillerson-after-clashes-taps-pompeo-idUSKCN1GP1NJ,"Trump fires chief diplomat Tillerson after clashes, taps Pompeo",2018-03-14,Roberta Rampton,"WASHINGTON ( ███ ) - U.S. President Donald Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Tuesday after a series of public rifts over policy on North Korea , Russia and Iran , replacing his chief diplomat with loyalist CIA Director Mike Pompeo .
The biggest shakeup of Trump ’ s Cabinet since he took office in January 2017 was announced by the president on Twitter as his administration works toward a potential meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un after months of harsh rhetoric and rising tensions on Pyongyang ’ s nuclear program .
The rare firing of the United States ’ top diplomat capped months of friction between the Republican president and the 65-year-old former Exxon Mobil Corp chief executive . The tensions peaked last fall amid reports Tillerson had called Trump a “ moron ” and considered resigning . Tillerson never denied using the word .
Critics expressed dismay at the decision to swap out top diplomats so soon before the unprecedented meeting and worried that Pompeo would encourage Trump to scrap the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and be hawkish on North Korea .
Critics said the move would sow more instability in the volatile Trump administration and marks the departure of another moderate who sought to emphasize the United States ’ strong ties to its allies amid Trump ’ s criticism .
Trump announced the changes in a morning Twitter post and later told reporters more about why he removed Tillerson .
“ We got along actually quite well but we disagreed on things , ” Trump said . “ When you look at the Iran deal : I think it ’ s terrible , I guess he thinks it was OK . I wanted to break it or do something , and he felt a little bit differently . ”
At the State Department , a visibly emotional Tillerson said Trump called him around noon from Air Force One , hours after he was summarily dismissed via Twitter . Tillerson also spoke with White House Chief of Staff John Kelly .
He said his tenure ends on March 31 but he would delegate his responsibilities to John Sullivan , deputy secretary of state , at the end of Tuesday .
“ What is most important is to ensure an orderly and smooth transition during a time that the country continues to face significant policy and national security challenges , ” Tillerson , whose voice quivered at times , told reporters in a packed briefing room .
He pointedly declined to thank Trump personally or praise him , as he has done on previous occasions , but emphasized his strong relationship with Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis . Together , the two were seen as a moderating influence on some of Trump ’ s policies .
However , Tillerson , also presided over a State Department which saw its role vastly diminished , with several high-profile posts unoccupied and many allies questioning the efficacy of dealing with a diplomat they suspected never had Trump ’ s ear .
In contrast , Trump said he and Pompeo have “ a similar thought process . ”

The biggest shakeup of Trump’s Cabinet since he took office in January 2017 was announced by the president on Twitter as his administration works toward a potential meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un after months of harsh rhetoric and rising tensions on Pyongyang’s nuclear program.

The rare firing of the United States’ top diplomat capped months of friction between the Republican president and the 65-year-old former Exxon Mobil Corp chief executive. The tensions peaked last fall amid reports Tillerson had called Trump a “moron” and considered resigning. Tillerson never denied using the word.

Critics expressed dismay at the decision to swap out top diplomats so soon before the unprecedented meeting and worried that Pompeo would encourage Trump to scrap the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and be hawkish on North Korea.

Critics said the move would sow more instability in the volatile Trump administration and marks the departure of another moderate who sought to emphasize the United States’ strong ties to its allies amid Trump’s criticism.

Trump announced the changes in a morning Twitter post and later told reporters more about why he removed Tillerson.

“We got along actually quite well but we disagreed on things,” Trump said. “When you look at the Iran deal: I think it’s terrible, I guess he thinks it was OK. I wanted to break it or do something, and he felt a little bit differently.”

At the State Department, a visibly emotional Tillerson said Trump called him around noon from Air Force One, hours after he was summarily dismissed via Twitter. Tillerson also spoke with White House Chief of Staff John Kelly.

He said his tenure ends on March 31 but he would delegate his responsibilities to John Sullivan, deputy secretary of state, at the end of Tuesday.

“What is most important is to ensure an orderly and smooth transition during a time that the country continues to face significant policy and national security challenges,” Tillerson, whose voice quivered at times, told reporters in a packed briefing room.

He pointedly declined to thank Trump personally or praise him, as he has done on previous occasions, but emphasized his strong relationship with Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis. Together, the two were seen as a moderating influence on some of Trump’s policies.

However, Tillerson, also presided over a State Department which saw its role vastly diminished, with several high-profile posts unoccupied and many allies questioning the efficacy of dealing with a diplomat they suspected never had Trump’s ear.

In contrast, Trump said he and Pompeo have “a similar thought process.”

Pompeo, a former Army officer who represented a Kansas district in the House of Representatives before taking the Central Intelligence Agency job, is seen as a Trump loyalist who has enjoyed a less hostile relationship with career spies than Tillerson had with career diplomats.

Trump chose the CIA’s deputy director, Gina Haspel, to replace Pompeo there. A veteran CIA clandestine officer, Haspel is backed by many in the U.S. intelligence community but is regarded warily by some in Congress for her involvement in the agency’s “black site” detention facilities.

Senior White House officials said Trump wanted his new team in place before any summit with Kim, who invited the U.S. president to meet by May after months of escalating tensions over North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs.

Tillerson listed several foreign policy objectives Washington was working on and singled out Russia for its “troubling behavior and actions.”

TILLERSON UNCLEAR ON REASON

Stocks were lower in the afternoon, shaking off early gains on data showing slowing consumer price inflation, on uncertainty about Tillerson’s dismissal and replacement by Pompeo.

“Pompeo is known to be a real hawk on trade and foreign policy,” said Jim Awad, senior managing director at Hartland & Co in New York. “There’s nobody to be a check and balance on Trump. It’s been unsettling to the market within the context of what we see now in the economy, which is a favorable backdrop.”

Tillerson’s imminent departure had been rumored for several months, and Trump said he and Tillerson had discussed the move. State Department officials said Tillerson did not know why he was being pushed out and had intended to stay. One of them, Steven Golstein, was fired later on Tuesday, after he contradicted the White House’s version.

Foreign policy experts from Republican and Democratic administrations also questioned Trump’s timing and choice, noting that Pompeo was known as a political partisan with hawkish views.

Evans Revere, a former senior U.S. diplomat who dealt with North Korea under President George W. Bush, said Trump’s move sends “a bad signal about the role of diplomacy.”

“Tillerson’s replacement by ... Pompeo, who is known as a political partisan and an opponent of the Iran agreement, raises the prospect of the collapse of that deal, and increases the possibility that the administration might soon face not one, but two nuclear crises,” he said.

Senior White House officials said Chief of Staff Kelly had asked Tillerson to step down on Friday but did not want to make it public while he was on a trip to Africa. Trump’s Twitter announcement came only a few hours after Tillerson, who cut his trip to Africa short, landed in Washington.

Tillerson appeared to be caught by surprise last week when Trump announced he had accepted Kim’s invitation to meet.

Tillerson joined a long list of senior officials who have either resigned or been fired since Trump took office.

OUT OF THE LOOP

Trump publicly undercut Tillerson’s diplomatic initiatives numerous times.

Last year Tillerson said the United States was directly communicating with North Korea but that Pyongyang had shown no interest in dialogue. Trump contradicted Tillerson’s efforts a day later.

“I told Rex Tillerson, our wonderful Secretary of State, that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man,” Trump wrote on Twitter, using a pejorative nickname for Kim.

Tillerson and Mattis had pressed a skeptical Trump to stick with the nuclear agreement with Iran and other world powers, and Tillerson has taken a more hawkish view than Trump on Russia.

Tillerson had emerged as a vocal critic on Russia - for its role in the annexation of Crimea, support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and alleged meddling in the U.S. election. He also singled out Russia for its apparent role in the Soviet-era nerve weapon used to poison a former Russian double agent in Britain - a position that initially diverged from the White House.

If confirmed by the U.S. Senate after an April committee hearing, Pompeo will be taking over a State Department shaken by the departures of many senior diplomats and embittered by proposed budget cuts.

Lawmakers from both major parties have criticized those cuts and the administration’s failure to fill dozens of open jobs there. But over time, many lawmakers grew to appreciate Tillerson as a relatively steady hand in the chaotic Trump administration.

“I’ve talked to the president many, many times and I know Secretary Tillerson. I’m very aware of the relationship,” said Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, a Republican. “And as I’ve mentioned publicly, I thought there was a reprieve that was under way since about the beginning of December, but, look.”

`` I am pleased to announce that Heather Nauert , Spokeswoman for the United States Department of State , will be nominated to serve as United Nations Ambassador . I want to congratulate Heather , and thank Ambassador Nikki Haley for her great service to our Country ! '' the president tweeted Friday .
The 48-year-old would replace Ambassador Nikki Haley who has been a vocal advocate for US foreign policy – and a strong supporter of Israel at the UN .
It 's a tradition Sam Brownback , the US ambassador for International Religious Freedom , is confident Nauert will continue . He points to the time when President Trump moved the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem , noting that Nauert faced the heat for the unpopular decision straight on as State Department spokesman .
`` She stood up there and defended the ground because there was a lot of media and people around the world pushing against that ... she 's going to be a strong supporter of Israel . She already has been , '' he told CBN News .
In terms of religious freedom , Brownback notes Nauert 's intimate knowledge and the hands-on approach she took to the recent religious freedom ministerial conference at the State Department .
`` She 's been here at the highest levels dealing with issues of foreign affairs all over the place , a very strong voice for religious freedom when we did our religious freedom ministerial , '' Brownback said . `` She was out there pushing the topics ... One of the key things from that position is the voice that you give because it is such a public position . ''
Nauert has served as the State Department spokesperson since April 2017 . She was later appointed as acting undersecretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs , making the former broadcast journalist one of the highest ranking women in the agency .
Trump 's nomination of Nauert comes at a time when the US finds itself embroiled in some tumultuous international relations with allies , like Canada and France . Struggles with authoritarian regimes such as Russia , China , North Korea and Saudi Arabia are also part of the daily headlines .
With that in mind , some skeptics are concerned that Nauert , a former Fox News anchor , may not have enough experience to handle the UN post .
`` In terms of what we normally look for at the United Nations , her resume is very thin , '' David Gergen , who served in the Nixon , Ford , Reagan , and Clinton administrations , told CNN 's Anderson Cooper , adding that the UN post is not `` strictly a communications job . ''
`` Traditionally , we 've either had people with a lot of experience in international affairs and/or a lot of experience as academics , '' he said .
However , some may have said the same about Haley when she was picked for the post since she had only served in state government . But conservatives deem her tenure at the UN to be a huge success .
Still , critics like Indiana University international relations professor David Bosco are opposing the move . He tells USA Today , `` Her only real foreign policy is this stint at the State Department in a kind of spokesperson role . Nor does she have what Haley had , which was significant high-level governing experience . So , as I look at who we have had in this position over the decades , I think Nauert would be one of the least prepared for this position . ''
Nevertheless , the White House appears confident Nauert is the right person to fill the role .
`` She 's very talented , very smart , very quick , '' the president told reporters gathered on the South Lawn of the White House Friday . `` I think she 's going to be respected by all . ''
Nauert would need to be confirmed by the US Senate , but if she passes that hurdle , she would become a top voice for Trump 's foreign policy .
In one of her recent tweets , Nauert reflected a tough stance against Russia saying : `` Ten days since Russia attacked Ukrainian ships and detained 24 personnel in the Black Sea . We join the EU and our Allies in calling on # Russia to immediately release the sailors and their vessels . # Crimea is # Ukraine . # Peace4Ukraine ''","WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump announced he will nominate State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert to be the next ambassador to the United Nations.

state_department,Guest Writer - Right,2,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/20/deceptions-hillary-clinton.html,OPINION: The deceptions of Hillary Clinton,2015-08-20,"Andrew Napolitano, Andrew P. Napolitano","While the scandal surrounding the emails sent and received by Hillary Clinton during her time as U.S. secretary of state continues to grow , Clinton has resorted to laughing it off . This past weekend she told an audience of Iowa Democrats that she loves her Snapchat account because the messages automatically disappear . Not everyone is laughing .
Clinton admits deleting 30,000 government emails from her time in office . She claims they were personal , and that because they were also on a personal server , she was free to destroy them . Yet , federal law defines emails used during the course of one ’ s work for the federal government as the property of the federal government .
She could have designated which of the government ’ s emails were personal and then asked the government to send them to her and delete them from government servers . Instead she did the reverse . She decided which of her emails were governmental and sent them on to the State Department . Under federal law , that is not a determination she may lawfully make .
Yet , the 55,000 emails she sent to the feds were printed emails . By doing so , she stole from the government the metadata it owns , which accompanies all digital emails but is missing on the paper copies , and she denied the government the opportunity to trace those emails .
When asked why she chose to divert government emails through her own server , Clinton stated she believed it would enable her to carry just one mobile device for both personal and governmental emails . She later admitted she carried four such devices .
Then the scandal got more serious , as Clinton ’ s lawyers revealed that after she deleted the 30,000 emails , and printed the 55,000 she surrendered to the feds , she had the server that carried and stored them professionally wiped clean .
She had already denied routing classified materials through her server : “ I did not email any classified material to anyone on my email . … [ I ] did not send classified material . ”
Then , the inspector general of the State Department and the inspector general of the intelligence community , each independent of the other , found four classified emails from among a random sample of 40 .
Then the State Department inspector general concluded that one of the four was in fact top secret . Since it discussed satellite imagery of a foreign country and since it revealed intercepts of communications among foreign agents , it received additional legal protections that were intended to assure that it was only discussed in a secure location and never shared with a foreign government , not even an ally .
When Clinton was confronted with these facts , she changed her explanation from “ I did not send classified material ” to “ I never sent or never received any email marked classified. ” Not only is she continually changing her story , but she is being deceptive again . Emails are not “ marked classified. ” They are marked “ top secret ” or “ secret ” or “ confidential. ” Her explanations remind one of her husband ’ s word-splitting playbook .
Last weekend the State Department located 305 of her undeleted emails that likely are in the top secret or secret or classified categories .
What should be the consequence of her behavior with the nation ’ s most sensitive secrets ?
If Clinton is indicted for failure to secure classified information , she will no doubt argue that if one of the above markings was not on the email , she did not know it was top secret . If she does make that incredible argument -- how could satellite photos of a foreign country together with communications intercepts of foreign agents possibly not be top secret ? -- she will be confronted with a judicial instruction to the jury trying her .
The judge will tell the jury that the secretary of state is presumed to know what is top secret and what is not . The only way she could rebut that presumption is to take the witness stand in her own defense and attempt to persuade the jury that she was so busy , she didn ’ t notice the nature of the secrets with which she was dealing .
Not only would such an argument be incredible coming from a person of her intellect and government experience , but it begs the question . That ’ s because by using only her own server , she knowingly diverted all classified emails sent to her away from the government ’ s secure venue . That ’ s the crime .
Consider this . In the past month , the Department of Justice indicted a young sailor who took a selfie in front of a sonar screen on a nuclear submarine and emailed the selfie to his girlfriend . It also indicted a Marine who sent an urgent warning to his superiors on his Gmail account about a dangerous Afghani spy who eventually killed three fellow Marines inside an American encampment . The emailing Marine was indicted for failure to secure classified materials . Gen. David Petraeus stored top-secret materials in an unlocked desk drawer in the study of his secured and guarded Virginia home and was indicted for the same crimes . And a former CIA agent was just sentenced to three years in prison for destroying one top-secret email .
What will happen if the FBI recommends that Clinton be indicted and the White House stonewalls ? Will FBI Director Jim Comey threaten to resign as he threatened to do when President George W. Bush wanted him to deviate from accepted professional standards ? Will Clinton get a pass ? Will the public accept that ?","While the scandal surrounding the emails sent and received by Hillary Clinton during her time as U.S. secretary of state continues to grow, Clinton has resorted to laughing it off.

Consider this. In the past month, the Department of Justice indicted a young sailor who took a selfie in front of a sonar screen on a nuclear submarine and emailed the selfie to his girlfriend. It also indicted a Marine who sent an urgent warning to his superiors on his Gmail account about a dangerous Afghani spy who eventually killed three fellow Marines inside an American encampment. The emailing Marine was indicted for failure to secure classified materials. Gen. David Petraeus stored top-secret materials in an unlocked desk drawer in the study of his secured and guarded Virginia home and was indicted for the same crimes. And a former CIA agent was just sentenced to three years in prison for destroying one top-secret email.

What will happen if the FBI recommends that Clinton be indicted and the White House stonewalls? Will FBI Director Jim Comey threaten to resign as he threatened to do when President George W. Bush wanted him to deviate from accepted professional standards? Will Clinton get a pass? Will the public accept that?",www.foxnews.com,right,aMaDBTfeqTROo3Th

The conservative legal group Judicial Watch obtained the emails as part of its lawsuit against the State Department . They cover Clinton 's first three months as secretary of state in early 2009 , a period for which Clinton did not turn over any emails to the State Department last year .

In one instance , Clinton exchanged messages with a senior Morgan Stanley investment executive whom she met with later that year at her office in Washington . They were among 246 pages of Abedin messages turned over to Judicial Watch .
Clinton campaign officials did not immediately answer questions about the issue .
The emails are separate from a larger batch of several thousand work-related emails that FBI officials recovered from Clinton 's private server .

It seemed that “ this year , ” he said in his Texas drawl , “ people felt the need to pray a little longer . ”
Perhaps Mr. Tillerson felt the need for a little extra prayer himself .
With the president who nominated him badgering allies over the phone and on Twitter , with hundreds of diplomats signing a “ dissent channel '' memo to express their dismay at recent executive orders on immigration and refugees – moreover , with a national security team in place at the White House that seems primed to bypass and overrule anything the State Department might advise – the nation ’ s new top diplomat faces an almost impossibly complex and daunting job .
“ It ’ s practically unprecedented , the situation he ’ s coming into , at the department itself and then with everything President Trump has managed to put on the table in just two weeks , ” says Wayne White , a former US diplomat who was deputy director of the State Department ’ s Middle East intelligence office .
Most of the State Department ’ s 75,000 employees at home and abroad just want to do their jobs effectively and will look to Tillerson for direction and inspiration , Mr. White says . But he adds that whether “ the new guy , ” as Tillerson dubbed himself Thursday , is just a good manager largely sidelined in foreign-policy making , or a commanding force globally , will depend largely on the relationship he develops with the White House .
“ How he manages to work with Trump & Co. – that will determine his strength , both in the building and outside around the world , ” White says .
No one doubts the former ExxonMobil CEO ’ s management skills , his ability to move smoothly in powerful circles , or his know-how in cutting international deals . As Tillerson puts it : When Mr. Trump picked him – a lifelong businessman with no formal diplomatic experience – his wife , Renda , told him : “ You didn ’ t know it , but you were in a 41-year training program for this job . ”
Tillerson also takes his new job with less than robust support in Congress , having squeaked through the Senate on a 56-43 confirmation vote – the narrowest for a secretary of State in at least a half-century .
But while developing a working relationship with Congress and managing the State Department may be one thing , experts say , imposing oneself at the White House and carrying the day on policy is quite another .
“ The most important factor in determining if a secretary of State will be successful or not is his or her relationship with the president , ” says Karl Inderfurth , a former assistant secretary of State for South Asian affairs . “ Without that strong tie , the secretary ends up an outlier on policymaking . ”
But almost as important , he adds , is the secretary of State ’ s relationship with the foreign policy advisers the president has chosen to surround him on a daily basis .
“ The key to Tillerson ’ s effectiveness with the president will be his relationship with the national security staff , ” says Mr. Inderfurth , who is now an adjunct professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington . “ How is Tillerson going to create the absolutely essential relationship with President Trump when there are those closer to the president with stronger and sometimes extreme views that they want to see carry the day ? ”
Tillerson ’ s moderately drawn-out confirmation effort gave Trump time to build and consolidate a White House national security team that looks to many experts like Fort Knox – not so easy to penetrate . Early White House decisions and priorities suggest four principal players are setting the agenda : retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn , the national security adviser ; Trump ’ s domestic political adviser , Steve Bannon – whom Trump elevated to a permanent seat on the National Security Council with an executive order ; and Trump ’ s son-in-law , Jared Kushner .
Trump ’ s chief of staff , Reince Priebus , completes the quartet of key advisers , close White House observers say .
General Flynn made it clear he intends to handle Iran policy when he publicly put Iran “ on notice ” this week over its ballistic missile testing and the White House announced Friday new sanctions on Iran . Mr. Kushner is said to have put dibs on Mexico affairs and Israeli-Palestinian issues .
It certainly isn ’ t unheard of for the secretary of State to be the odd man out in foreign-policy making – just ask Colin Powell , who was sidelined to the State Department while the White House national security team plotted war on Iraq . President Nixon ’ s first secretary of State , William Rogers , “ was totally out of the loop on the breakthrough with China until after it happened , ” Inderfurth notes .
The Trump White House has also wasted little time in airing its disregard for the State Department and its thousands of nonpolitical foreign-service officers . When nearly 1,000 US diplomats signed a “ dissent channel ” memo expressing their opposition to Trump ’ s orders suspending refugee resettlement and placing a temporary travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries , White House reaction was swift and public .
“ I think they can either get with the program or go , ” White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters at a White House briefing , either unaware or unimpressed that the dissent channel is a decades-old provision for career diplomats to express disagreement with policy .
Another challenge Tillerson faces as America ’ s top envoy to the world is Trump ’ s attack-dog approach to other leaders , including some allies . The president sent shock waves around the world this week when he got belligerent with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull over an Obama administration refugee agreement and then abruptly ended their phone call . Earlier Trump told Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto over the phone that he might send US troops across the border if Mexico didn ’ t round up its “ bad hombres ” on its own .
With much of the world rattled by Trump ’ s “ tough ” style , Tillerson might want to set off overseas soon to smooth ruffled feathers . But Inderfurth cautions the new secretary of State against too much time out of Washington – and away from the White House – if he wants to play a determining role in steering US foreign policy .
“ Tillerson is going to need to do a reassurance swing through Europe and with other key allies , but he ’ ll also have to keep in mind that while he ’ s away , the White House mice will play , ” he says . “ Everyone who knows Trump says the last person he speaks to is the most influential on a decision , so it will work against Tillerson if he ’ s not only not in the White House , but often out of town . ”
One big clue as to whether Tillerson intends to assert the State Department ’ s role in foreign policy will come when he fills the top positions around him , including deputy secretary .
“ If he brings in a lot of political appointees from outside the diplomatic ranks , that ’ s not going to go over well inside the department and he ’ ll start off with a lack of trust , ” says White , an adjunct scholar at the Middle East Institute in Washington .

''
The appearance marked the debut for the former CIA director as the United States 's top diplomat , and underscored his role as an emissary for Trump abroad .
Pompeo 's remarks seemed to set him apart from his predecessor , Rex Tillerson Rex Wayne TillersonSteve Schmidt : 'Overwhelming chance that Trump will dump Pence ' for Haley Nikki Haley : Trump 'truthful ' in 'every instance that I dealt with him ' Tillerson denies Haley 's claims of taking actions to undermine Trump MORE , who faced questions about his tempestuous relationship with a president often willing to break with his top diplomat .
Still , Pompeo is sure to face a number of challenges in his new role , including filling various vacancies at the State Department , helping plot talks with North Korea and maintaining a unified message with the president .
The tenure of Pompeo 's predecessor , Rex Tillerson , was haunted by a narrative of discontent and low morale among the department 's career officials . Now Pompeo faces the challenge of flipping that storyline .
There are signals that he may be able to do that . Pompeo 's stewardship of the CIA has reportedly convinced some State Department officials that he has the managerial skills needed to lead America 's diplomatic mission .
Still , others have continued to voice concerns that Pompeo could act as a type of `` yes man '' for Trump , who campaigned on an `` America first '' vision of U.S. foreign policy and has often appeared skeptical of more traditional means of diplomacy .
In his confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee earlier this month , Pompeo acknowledged the desire of department officials to be `` empowered . ''
`` In a recent series of department briefings with team members at State , they all , to a person , expressed a hope to be empowered in their roles , and to have a clear understanding of the president ’ s mission , '' he said .
Also key to Pompeo 's success at the State Department is whether he can help fill dozens of vacant positions . Of the 161 Senate-confirmed positions at the State Department , 61 still have no nominee , according to figures tracked by The Washington Post and the nonprofit group Partnership for Public Service .
Pompeo acknowledged during his confirmation hearing that the vacancies were a source of low morale at the agency and vowed to help fill the jobs .
`` I ’ ll do my part to end the vacancies , but I ’ ll need your help , '' he told lawmakers .
Even before his State Department confirmation , Pompeo exercised his diplomatic duties when he was quietly dispatched to Pyongyang earlier this month to help lay the groundwork for a possible meeting between Trump and North Korea 's Kim Jong Un .
The White House on Friday released images of Pompeo and the North Korean leader shaking hands while facing each other , with Trump administration officials casting the meeting as a positive diplomatic step toward a summit between Trump and Kim .
But looming over his work on Trump 's potential May or June summit with Kim are questions about Pompeo 's views on regime change in North Korea .
During his confirmation hearing this month , Pompeo told senators that he had `` never advocated '' for such a shift .
But that claim appeared to contradict a remark he made last summer , when the then-CIA director suggested during a security conference in Aspen that the U.S. pursue a way to `` separate that regime from this system . ''
`` The North Korean people I 'm sure are lovely people and would love to see him go , '' Pompeo said at the time .
Officials acknowledge that relations between Russia and the West have sunk to their lowest point in decades , punctuated by both sides expelling scores of diplomats over the poisoning of a former double agent in the U.K. last month that Western nations have blamed on Russia .
The deterioration in relations has also been spurred by Moscow 's backing of pro-Russia separatists in Ukraine , state-sponsored meddling in foreign elections and the Kremlin 's support of Syrian President Bashar Assad amid that country 's years-long civil war .
While the Trump administration has taken several actions viewed as unfriendly toward Moscow , the president himself has often appeared reluctant to openly criticize his Russian counterpart , Vladimir Putin , and the Russian government .
Pompeo , on the other hand , has been more openly critical of Moscow . He made that position clear in his confirmation hearing , blaming the poor condition of U.S.-Russia relations on `` Russian bad behavior . ''
That may help Pompeo to cast himself as a counterweight as the Trump administration seeks to strike a balance between being overly critical of an increasingly ambitious Russia and appearing too eager for warmer relations .
Pompeo 's tenure in Foggy Bottom comes at a particularly tumultuous time in the Middle East — a reality embodied in the almost immediate dispatch of the newly minted secretary of State to Saudi Arabia , Israel and Jordan this week .
Trump is sprinting toward a May 12 deadline for deciding whether to keep the U.S. in the Obama-era Iran nuclear deal , which he and Pompeo have both derided as a diplomatic disaster .
But during his confirmation hearing , Pompeo indicated that he wanted to `` fix the deal , '' and suggested that , even if Trump were to withdraw from the pact , Tehran would not be likely to develop a nuclear weapon immediately .
That assertion signaled a break from Pompeo 's past warnings that Iran was bound and determined to develop a working nuclear arsenal .
As Trump prepares to make a decision on the Iran deal , the U.S. is also hurtling toward another major diplomatic move : opening a new embassy in Jerusalem .

Still, Pompeo is sure to face a number of challenges in his new role, including filling various vacancies at the State Department, helping plot talks with North Korea and maintaining a unified message with the president.

Here are five challenges for Pompeo:

Building up morale at the State Department

The tenure of Pompeo's predecessor, Rex Tillerson, was haunted by a narrative of discontent and low morale among the department's career officials. Now Pompeo faces the challenge of flipping that storyline.

There are signals that he may be able to do that. Pompeo's stewardship of the CIA has reportedly convinced some State Department officials that he has the managerial skills needed to lead America's diplomatic mission.

Still, others have continued to voice concerns that Pompeo could act as a type of ""yes man"" for Trump, who campaigned on an ""America first"" vision of U.S. foreign policy and has often appeared skeptical of more traditional means of diplomacy.

In his confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee earlier this month, Pompeo acknowledged the desire of department officials to be ""empowered.""

""In a recent series of department briefings with team members at State, they all, to a person, expressed a hope to be empowered in their roles, and to have a clear understanding of the president’s mission,"" he said.

Also key to Pompeo's success at the State Department is whether he can help fill dozens of vacant positions. Of the 161 Senate-confirmed positions at the State Department, 61 still have no nominee, according to figures tracked by The Washington Post and the nonprofit group Partnership for Public Service.

Pompeo acknowledged during his confirmation hearing that the vacancies were a source of low morale at the agency and vowed to help fill the jobs.

""I’ll do my part to end the vacancies, but I’ll need your help,"" he told lawmakers.

Navigating talks with North Korea

Even before his State Department confirmation, Pompeo exercised his diplomatic duties when he was quietly dispatched to Pyongyang earlier this month to help lay the groundwork for a possible meeting between Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un.

The White House on Friday released images of Pompeo and the North Korean leader shaking hands while facing each other, with Trump administration officials casting the meeting as a positive diplomatic step toward a summit between Trump and Kim.

But looming over his work on Trump's potential May or June summit with Kim are questions about Pompeo's views on regime change in North Korea.

During his confirmation hearing this month, Pompeo told senators that he had ""never advocated"" for such a shift.

But that claim appeared to contradict a remark he made last summer, when the then-CIA director suggested during a security conference in Aspen that the U.S. pursue a way to ""separate that regime from this system.""

""The North Korean people I'm sure are lovely people and would love to see him go,"" Pompeo said at the time.

Managing tensions with Moscow

Officials acknowledge that relations between Russia and the West have sunk to their lowest point in decades, punctuated by both sides expelling scores of diplomats over the poisoning of a former double agent in the U.K. last month that Western nations have blamed on Russia.

The deterioration in relations has also been spurred by Moscow's backing of pro-Russia separatists in Ukraine, state-sponsored meddling in foreign elections and the Kremlin's support of Syrian President Bashar Assad amid that country's years-long civil war.

While the Trump administration has taken several actions viewed as unfriendly toward Moscow, the president himself has often appeared reluctant to openly criticize his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, and the Russian government.

Pompeo, on the other hand, has been more openly critical of Moscow. He made that position clear in his confirmation hearing, blaming the poor condition of U.S.-Russia relations on ""Russian bad behavior.""

That may help Pompeo to cast himself as a counterweight as the Trump administration seeks to strike a balance between being overly critical of an increasingly ambitious Russia and appearing too eager for warmer relations.

Key decisions in the Middle East

Pompeo's tenure in Foggy Bottom comes at a particularly tumultuous time in the Middle East — a reality embodied in the almost immediate dispatch of the newly minted secretary of State to Saudi Arabia, Israel and Jordan this week.

Trump is sprinting toward a May 12 deadline for deciding whether to keep the U.S. in the Obama-era Iran nuclear deal, which he and Pompeo have both derided as a diplomatic disaster.

But during his confirmation hearing, Pompeo indicated that he wanted to ""fix the deal,"" and suggested that, even if Trump were to withdraw from the pact, Tehran would not be likely to develop a nuclear weapon immediately.

That assertion signaled a break from Pompeo's past warnings that Iran was bound and determined to develop a working nuclear arsenal.

As Trump prepares to make a decision on the Iran deal, the U.S. is also hurtling toward another major diplomatic move: opening a new embassy in Jerusalem.

The president's decision to transfer the outpost from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem has been a sore spot for Palestinians, whose leadership cut off contact with the White House after the December announcement.

But as CIA director, Pompeo reportedly developed a good rapport with both Israeli and Palestinian intelligence officials, which could help him quell tensions with the Palestinians.

Shoring up diplomatic relations

Tillerson's often-fraught relationship with Trump gave rise to questions from foreign governments about whether the secretary of State enjoyed the confidence of the president — or even spoke for the administration.

During his tenure at the CIA, however, Pompeo quickly became a close confidant of Trump, often delivering intelligence briefings at the president's request. That could lend the secretary of State more weight abroad than his predecessor.

Yet despite Pompeo's perceived closeness to Trump on key policy issues, the secretary of State still faces the unique challenge of his diplomatic work being potentially rendered null or dramatically altered on a moment's notice by a presidential tweet.

People have been talking a lot lately about the National Security Agency. But there's another important ""NSA"" in the federal government — the president's national security adviser.

Susan Rice has been in the job for only a month — but it's been one heck of a month. The day Rice started her new job, Egypt's military overthrew the Egyptian government.

Rice did not need Senate confirmation to be President Obama's national security adviser.

Those crucible experiences shape the person Rice is today. She painfully learned the cost of not doing enough.

Ben Rhodes works closely with Rice as deputy national security adviser at the White House, where, he says, ""there's definitely a lean toward action because there's an understanding that there's really no margin for error.""

Tillerson would be replaced within weeks by CIA Director Mike Pompeo, a Trump loyalist and foreign policy hard-liner, under a White House plan to carry out the most significant staff shake-up so far of the Trump administration.

Republican Senator Tom Cotton, one of Trump’s staunchest defenders in Congress, would be tapped to replace Pompeo at the Central Intelligence Agency, the officials told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.

It was not immediately clear whether Trump had given final approval to the reshuffle, but one of the officials said the president asked for the plan to be put together.

Tillerson’s long-rumored departure would end a troubled tenure for the former Exxon Mobil Corp chief executive, who has been increasingly at odds with Trump over issues such as North Korea and under fire for planned cuts at the State Department.

Tillerson was reported in October to have privately called Trump a “moron,” something the secretary of state sought to dismiss.

That followed a tweet by Trump that Tillerson should not waste his time by seeking negotiations with North Korea over its nuclear and missile program, widely seen as a sign of the secretary of state being marginalized.

Trump has soured on Tillerson mostly because of the “moron” report, his less confrontational approach on North Korea and differences over the Qatar crisis, one senior U.S. official said.

His slow approach to filling diplomatic openings at the State Department is also a factor, another official said.

Trump asked John Kelly, the White House chief of staff, to develop the transition strategy, and it has been discussed with other officials, one administration source said.

Under the plan, which has been in the works for weeks and was first reported by the New York Times, the reshuffle would happen around the end of the year or shortly afterward, the official said.

Asked whether he wanted Tillerson to remain in his job, Trump sidestepped the question, telling reporters at the White House: “He’s here. Rex is here.”

State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said Kelly told Tillerson’s chief of staff on Thursday the reports on Tillerson being replaced were not true. Nauert added that Tillerson “serves at the pleasure of the president.”

Asked about Tillerson, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said the secretary of state remained in his post. “When the president loses confidence in someone, they will no longer serve here,” she said.

Pompeo, a former congressman, has moved to the forefront as he has gained Trump’s trust on national security matters.

Tillerson, 65, has spent much of his tenure trying to smooth the rough edges of Trump’s unilateralist “America First” foreign policy, with limited success. On several occasions, the president publicly undercut his diplomatic initiatives.

If carried out, the staff changes would be the latest in a string of firings or resignations in the Trump administration including the departures of the chief of staff, national security adviser and FBI director.

Pompeo, 53, has taken tough foreign policy stands, especially on Iran, and talked about how his agency is becoming more aggressive and how he has been focusing on deploying more CIA officers overseas.

He has offered effusive praise for Trump despite the president’s criticism of U.S. intelligence agencies, some of which concluded that Russia conducted an influence campaign to boost Trump in the 2016 presidential election.

Tillerson has at times put distance between himself and Trump’s positions.

At a private dinner of foreign policy veterans last month, a senior White House official criticized Tillerson for failing to support the president’s agenda, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Tillerson joined Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in pressing Trump not to pull the United States out of an agreement with Iran and world powers over Tehran’s nuclear capabilities.

Tillerson has taken a more hawkish view than Trump on Russia and tried to mediate a dispute after four Arab nations launched a boycott of Qatar.

In September in Beijing, Tillerson said Washington was probing North Korea to see whether it was interested in dialogue, and had multiple direct channels of communication with Pyongyang.

The next day, Trump appeared to dismiss those efforts in a tweet, telling Tillerson he was “wasting his time.”

Tensions have also run high between Tillerson and veteran diplomats who oppose his proposed staff and budget cuts.",www.reuters.com,center,ngmmSPsbsmiH3O1u

Other U.S. officials said the threat was specifically in the Muslim world.

The issue of security abroad has been prominent since the attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya, and a string of demonstrations on other U.S. embassies in the Middle East and North Africa.

On Thursday, measures to beef up security at U.S. embassies were passed out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The bill is in response to the Sept. 11, 2012 attack on the diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, where Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed.

The Senate bill creates a training center for diplomatic security personnel.

Separately, the House Foreign Affairs Committee authorized full security funding for diplomatic missions -- despite recommending a nine percent cut overall for State Department operations.

The House and Senate have already approved spending bills that cover embassy security. But their budgets differ markedly in other areas.

""We are not going to completely eliminate terrorism,"" Obama says

All but one of the U.S. diplomatic posts closed last week in a sweeping response to fears of a possible al Qaeda attack will reopen Sunday, the State Department said.

The Obama administration closed 19 embassies and consulates throughout the Middle East and North Africa, and issued a worldwide travel alert due to the threat apparently linked to communications between leaders of the terror group.

The closures took effect August 4.

The embassy in Sanaa Yemen, where al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in based, will remain closed because of continued concerns about a possible attack.

Separately, the State Department withdrew most of its diplomatic personnel from its consulate in Lahore, Pakistan, on Thursday, citing a ""separate credible threat."" It warned U.S. citizens against travel to Pakistan.

Diplomatic personnel were moved to the capital, Islamabad. The Lahore facility will remain closed.

""We will continue to evaluate the threats to Sanaa and Lahore and make subsequent decisions about the reopening of those facilities based on that information,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement.

He accused ISIS of “ crimes against humanity ” and `` ethnic cleansing . ''

Yet as the department took heat from lawmakers for the expected delay , the department confirmed Thursday morning that Kerry had reached the decision that Christians , Yazidis and Shiite groups are victims of genocide .
It comes after the House this week passed a nonbinding resolution by a 393-0 vote condemning ISIS atrocities as genocide .
Kerry 's finding will not obligate the United States to take additional action against ISIS militants and does not prejudge any prosecution against its members , said U.S. officials .
Kerry , though , urged others to join in holding the group “ accountable ” ; he called for an “ independent investigation ” as well as a court or tribunal to take action to that end .
Saying the terror network is “ genocidal ” in what it says , believes and does , Kerry recited a litany of documented atrocities including the execution of Christians in Iraq “ solely because of their faith ” and of Yazidis .

He added that “ President Obama should step up and lay out the broad , overarching plan that ’ s needed to actually defeat and destroy ISIS . This administration ’ s long pattern of paralysis and ineffectiveness in combating these radical Islamist terrorists is unacceptable . ”
The determination marks only the second time a U.S. administration has declared that a genocide was being committed during an ongoing conflict .
The first was in 2004 , when then-Secretary of State Colin Powell determined that atrocities in Sudan 's Darfur region constituted genocide . Powell reached that determination amid much lobbying from human rights groups , but only after State Department lawyers advised him that it would not -- contrary to legal advice offered to previous administrations -- obligate the United States to act to stop it .
In that case , the lawyers decided that the 1948 U.N. Convention against genocide did not require countries to prevent genocide from taking place outside their territory . Powell instead called for the U.N. Security Council to appoint a commission to investigate and take appropriate legal action if it agreed with the genocide determination .
The officials said Kerry 's determination followed a similar finding by department lawyers .
Although the United States is involved in military strikes against ISIS and has helped prevent some incidents of ethnic cleansing , notably of Yazidis , some advocates argue that a genocide determination would require additional U.S. action .
In making his decision , Kerry weighed whether the militants ' targeting of Christians and other minorities meets the definition of genocide , according to the U.N. Convention : `` acts committed with intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnic , racial or religious group . ''
His determination , however , does not carry the legal implication of a verdict of guilt or conviction on genocide charges , the officials said . Such decisions will be left to international or other tribunals .
In a bid to push the review process , several groups released reports last week documenting what they said is clear evidence that the legal standard has been met .

It was probably not the way she would have chosen to go out.

Wednesday’s combative Senate hearing on the Benghazi attacks was one of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s last, most high-profile public appearances of her time at Foggy Bottom.

In a few days, one of the most famous women on the planet will step off the public stage for the first time in 30 years — and she’s not going quietly.

She choked up, she raised her voice, she took full responsibility for the death of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three others, and she was defiant.

When Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) pressed her on who knew what when, she slapped him down with a raised voice: “With all due respect, four Americans were dead. What difference at this point does it make?”

This was no gauzy farewell tour, no clubby appearance before her former Senate colleagues, although most thanked her for her service. She will be back Thursday to introduce her likely successor, Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.), before the committee.

Left unsaid, however: this is likely not her ultimate act. Already, the question — will she run for president? — follows her around relentlessly.

And if there were any consolation for Clinton on Wednesday, it doesn’t seem that the American public is holding the former first lady responsible for the death of four Americans in Libya, even as some Republican senators tried their level best to pin it on her.

She’s leaving with the highest approval ratings of her political career — 67 percent of all Americans, and 91 percent of Democrats approve of her, according to a new Washington Post/ABC News poll, while only 26 percent disapprove. Despite a health scare last month, she showed up and came out swinging for a pair of Hill hearings this week.

state_department,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/16/hillary-clinton-emails-safe-provided-to-lawyer-amo/,Hillary Clinton emails: Safe provided to lawyer among irregularities seen in review,2015-08-16,John Solomon,"When State Department officials first discovered that Hillary Rodham Clinton ’ s personal email account contained classified information , they did not seize the thumb drive containing her digitally archived inbox but rather provided her attorney a special safe to secure the device , according to interviews and documents .
The move allowed Mrs. Clinton ’ s attorney to keep the device for several additional weeks while State officials reviewed paper copies of the emails for possible classified data . Officials were unconcerned that the thumb drive remained out of their possession because preservation orders from courts and Congress would ensure that her attorney would not destroy the evidence . The digital archive was turned over to the FBI for examination this month .
Throughout the review process , career State officials who normally handle the release of data under the Freedom of Information Act ran into disagreements with attorneys about which information in the emails was classified , The ███ has learned .
The disagreements are part of a complex , and at times tense , process in which career lawyers and career FOIA officials , along with a dozen intelligence review analysts from different agencies , are trying to identify and protect intelligence information contained in Mrs. Clinton ’ s personal email account . State and FOIA lawyers normally work together on such requests , but this case has heightened tensions given Mrs. Clinton ’ s status as the Democratic presidential front-runner .
The ongoing process has already flagged 60 of Mrs. Clinton ’ s personal emails as containing classified information at the “ confidential ” or “ secret ” level , although a debate is raging over additional emails that the intelligence community and career State officials believe contain more sensitive top-secret data , officials confirmed .
SEE ALSO : State Dept . confirms Clinton aides had other unreported email accounts
Amid the tensions , some career State employees have now alerted the intelligence community to irregularities that they fear may hide from the public the true extent of classified information that passed through her personal account , people familiar with the matter told The Times .
Their concerns include that one or more State Department attorneys involved in the production of the former secretary of state ’ s emails to Congress and a federal court have ties to Mrs. Clinton ’ s private attorney ’ s firm , creating at least the perception internally of a conflict of interest , sources told The Times , speaking only on the condition of anonymity .
The complaints were received by Intelligence Community Inspector General I. Charles McCullough III ’ s office in recent weeks and have been referred to the State Department ’ s chief watchdog , the sources said .
The development opens up a potential new investigative front in a controversy that has already tarnished Mrs. Clinton ’ s presidential bid .
“ At present , [ the career officials ] have not formally sought whistleblower status , but their disclosures are likely legally protected from retaliation since they involve matters affecting Congress , the courts and national security , ” one of the sources directly familiar with the matter told The Times .
Since the revelation this spring that Mrs. Clinton had a private email server where she conducted some official business , the State Department has been busy reviewing some 30,000 emails in that account for possible release to both the House Select Committee on Benghazi and a federal court handling a FOIA lawsuit .
State officials told The Times that they are aware of tensions and disagreements during the extraordinary review process , and State Department Inspector General Stephen Linick , the department ’ s independent watchdog , is free to investigate any concerns raised by employees .
They noted that Secretary of State John F. Kerry this spring , well before internal disputes arose , asked Mr. Linick to review the department ’ s security standards that let Mrs. Clinton conduct official business on a private email account .
“ Secretary Kerry affirmatively asked for the State Department Inspector General to review the Department ’ s records maintenance and FOIA processes and provide recommendations , ” the department said in a statement to The Times . “ As is customary , the IG ’ s review is entirely independent , and they are free to speak to any Department employees in the course of their work . ”
Spokesmen for the State and Intelligence Community inspectors-general declined to comment .
State officials acknowledged that one extraordinary step taken by the department ’ s leadership occurred in May when reviewing officials identified the first pieces of classified information inside Mrs. Clinton ’ s personal email .
At the time , State officials had access to only paper copies of the emails but were aware that Mrs. Clinton ’ s personal attorney , David Kendall , had an electronic copy of her email inbox in a .pst format stored on a thumb drive . The .pst format is commonly used for email programs like Microsoft Outlook .
Rather than seize the thumb drive and turn it over to the intelligence community , State provided a special secure safe capable of protecting classified information up to the “ secret ” level , officials confirmed to The Times .
That arrangement allowed Mr. Kendall to hold on to the electronic archive for several more weeks until the ongoing review flagged at least two emails containing possible top-secret information , the most sensitive of the nation ’ s intelligence , officials acknowledged .
The most recent revelation about possible top-secret information finally prompted Mr. Kendall to turn over the thumb drive as well as the original email server ’ s hard drive to the FBI in recent days .
State officials said they were not concerned about leaving the device with Mr. Kendall in the safe they provided because they had paper copies of the emails , Mr. Kendall had a prior-issued security clearance and the emails were subject to court protective orders that they couldn ’ t be destroyed .
But career State and intelligence community officials found the arrangement with the safe to be highly unusual .
Memos released by the State inspector general show Patrick Kennedy , undersecretary of state for management , has refused the intelligence community ’ s request to keep Mrs. Clinton ’ s stash of emails in a network for “ top secret ” material . State officials counter that any top-secret memos will be properly handled on the right equipment and with the right procedures .
On the campaign trail over the weekend , Mrs. Clinton seemed to mock the intelligence community ’ s concerns over securing documents . She quipped that she now uses a popular social media outlet that makes messages disappear automatically .
Career officials , meanwhile , ran into disagreements with lawyers from the department legal counsel ’ s office concerning which passages inside Mrs. Clinton ’ s private emails should be declared classified in the FOIA lawsuit .
The career employees told the intelligence community that some of the email passages they flagged to be exempted from FOIA release as classified were altered during the legal review process to other exemptions , such as “ deliberative privilege , ” according to sources familiar with the concerns .
The whistleblowers told the intelligence community that they feared the changes from “ classified ” to other exemptions were deliberate and might hide from the public the true extent of classified secrets that flowed through Mrs. Clinton ’ s personal email account , sources said .
State officials acknowledged to The Times that the multiple layers of review have resulted in different determinations about classification and occasional disagreements .
State officials said the disagreements ran both ways between career lawyers and career FOIA officials .
FOIA officials are concerned about issues related to their tasks , intelligence community analysts are worried about protecting their respective agencies ’ secrets , and the attorneys are worried about ensuring their representations to the courts are defensible , the officials said .
“ The IC is looking at this as needing to protect classified information . And the lawyers are looking at this as they have to defend to a judge why something was redacted from an email and kept from public release , especially if the FOIA case goes to appeal . Those are different responsibilities that create natural tensions , ” one official familiar with the process said .
State officials said it may take weeks or months to resolve all the disputes , but the goal is to reach consensus eventually between the intelligence community and State ’ s various layers of review .
Officials said the department ultimately isn ’ t trying to hide the extent to which classified information passed through Mrs. Clinton ’ s private email account . They noted that while the media have focused on just a half-dozen of Mrs. Clinton ’ s personal emails containing secret intelligence , State ’ s own internal review has already flagged 60 emails through July 30 containing classified data . They expect that number to rise before all 30,000 emails are reviewed .
Of those first 60 , nearly all contained classified secrets at the lowest level of “ confidential , ” and one contained information at the intermediate level of “ secret , ” officials told The Times .
State officials are working with Mr. McCullough ’ s office to review two emails his team has flagged as containing “ top-secret ” information derived from possible Pentagon satellites , drones or intercepts , which is some of the nation ’ s most sensitive secrets .
“ Wherever the facts end up , that is where the determination will end , ” one official said . “ The IGs have the independence to help us resolve these issues . ”
The debate about the higher-level classified data is complicated by what is known as dual-source information .
Dual-source information involves situations in which the intelligence community reports information through classified channels at the same time open sources such as the news media disclose the same event .
For instance , the Pentagon may report to State officials a drone strike killed a terrorist leader with the specifics of the location , the type of drone used and the intelligence that led to the strike , while news outlets may report the drone strike and death based on an announcement of a foreign government or terrorist organization .
Officials are reviewing the circumstances around a handful of flagged emails to ensure no dual-source information was involved , the sources said .
Meanwhile , some of what is fueling career officials ’ concerns is the apparent background of the lawyers involved in the email reviews for both Congress and the courts .
The officials told the intelligence community that they believe one or more of those lawyers previously worked at the Williams & Connolly firm where Mrs. Clinton ’ s attorney , Mr. Kendall , is a senior partner .
A check of public records identified at least one State Department attorney , Catherine “ Kate ” Duval , who previously worked at Williams & Connolly . A Politico profile identified Ms. Duval as having left Williams & Connolly to work for the Obama administration on the IRS targeting scandal before moving to State in the past year .
State officials confirmed to The Times that Ms. Duval has been working on Mrs. Clinton ’ s emails but primarily in the capacity of helping to produce those that are relevant to the House Special Committee on Benghazi . She is not part of the team of attorneys advising on legal matters involving the FOIA case .
“ Kate Duval is an exceptional professional and has the department ’ s utmost confidence , ” State spokesman Alec Gerlach said Sunday night .
The officials said privacy laws prevented them from identifying any other lawyers inside their department who might have worked for Williams & Connolly but that they were confident that none of the lawyers working on the email matter had any prior representation of Mrs. Clinton on personal matters before they joined State .
As for conflicts of interests , just working in the same law firm previously as Mrs. Clinton ’ s attorney isn ’ t a legal disqualifier , officials noted .
“ The department has complete confidence that its attorneys — who are almost exclusively career department lawyers — perform to the highest professional and ethical standards , including in connection with the review and release of Secretary Clinton ’ s emails , ” Mr. Gerlach said .","When State Department officials first discovered that Hillary Rodham Clinton’s personal email account contained classified information, they did not seize the thumb drive containing her digitally archived inbox but rather provided her attorney a special safe to secure the device, according to interviews and documents.

Howard Krongard , a George W. Bush administration appointee who served as the State Department inspector general from April 2005 to January 2008 , cited his own experience in challenging Clinton ’ s insistence that her practices were nothing out of the ordinary .
“ Certainly to my knowledge at least , Secretary [ Condoleezza ] Rice did not have a personal server . I certainly never either sent an email to one or received an email from one , ” said Krongard , who served during Rice ’ s tenure .
Further , he said , “ I would have been stunned had I been asked to send an email to her at a personal server , private address . I would have declined to do so on security grounds and if she had sent one to me , I probably would have started an investigation . ”
Krongard noted that during Clinton ’ s four-year term , from January 2009 to January 2013 , there was no Senate-confirmed inspector general in place . Suggesting the Clintons show a pattern of avoiding oversight , Krongard indicated that Hillary Clinton benefited from the fact there was no IG during her term .
`` I would ’ ve been the most unpopular person in that building [ had I been there ] , '' Krongard said , emphasizing that the inspector general has broad powers and the ability to rein in even the most senior political appointees . `` They are the people who enforce the rules , and there was no one enforcing the rules during that time . ''
Krongard spoke with Fox News before the current State Department inspector general ’ s office , led by Steve A. Linick , issued an extensive report on email practices of previous secretaries of state .
The day that report was issued , Clinton said in an interview that her use of personal email was consistent with predecessors Colin Powell and Rice .
`` Just like previous secretaries of state , I used a personal email . Many people did . It was not at all unprecedented , '' she said .
But , as Krongard indicated , the May 25 IG report clearly stated that Rice did not use personal email for government business . It said Powell used personal email on a limited basis to connect with people outside the department , and he worked with the State Department to secure the system . The report found Clinton did neither .
The report concluded Clinton ’ s use of a private server and account was not approved , and broke agency rules . The report said by the time she became secretary , the rules had repeatedly been updated , and were “ considerably more detailed and more sophisticated . ”
Krongard resigned from the IG position in December 2007 after accusations he blocked Iraq-related investigations , charges he denied .
Regarding the 2,100 emails on Clinton ’ s server found to have contained classified information -- and another 22 “ Top Secret ” messages containing intelligence deemed too damaging to national security to make public – Krongard questioned how that material got there . He said it would take a deliberate act for the intelligence to `` jump the gap '' between the classified computer networks and Clinton 's personal server .
`` It could be done by taking a screen shot with … a camera of a classified email , take a screen shot and send it to an unclassified network . It could be copied , but there are restrictions in the State Department and elsewhere as to what copiers can work from a classified network and it can only be a secure copier . So that may not have been easy , '' Krongard said .

Howard Krongard, a George W. Bush administration appointee who served as the State Department inspector general from April 2005 to January 2008, cited his own experience in challenging Clinton’s insistence that her practices were nothing out of the ordinary.

“Certainly to my knowledge at least, Secretary [Condoleezza] Rice did not have a personal server. I certainly never either sent an email to one or received an email from one,” said Krongard, who served during Rice’s tenure.

Further, he said, “I would have been stunned had I been asked to send an email to her at a personal server, private address. I would have declined to do so on security grounds and if she had sent one to me, I probably would have started an investigation.”

Krongard noted that during Clinton’s four-year term, from January 2009 to January 2013, there was no Senate-confirmed inspector general in place. Suggesting the Clintons show a pattern of avoiding oversight, Krongard indicated that Hillary Clinton benefited from the fact there was no IG during her term.

""I would’ve been the most unpopular person in that building [had I been there],"" Krongard said, emphasizing that the inspector general has broad powers and the ability to rein in even the most senior political appointees. ""They are the people who enforce the rules, and there was no one enforcing the rules during that time.""

Krongard spoke with Fox News before the current State Department inspector general’s office, led by Steve A. Linick, issued an extensive report on email practices of previous secretaries of state.

The day that report was issued, Clinton said in an interview that her use of personal email was consistent with predecessors Colin Powell and Rice.

""Just like previous secretaries of state, I used a personal email. Many people did. It was not at all unprecedented,"" she said.

But, as Krongard indicated, the May 25 IG report clearly stated that Rice did not use personal email for government business. It said Powell used personal email on a limited basis to connect with people outside the department, and he worked with the State Department to secure the system. The report found Clinton did neither.

The report concluded Clinton’s use of a private server and account was not approved, and broke agency rules. The report said by the time she became secretary, the rules had repeatedly been updated, and were “considerably more detailed and more sophisticated.”

Krongard resigned from the IG position in December 2007 after accusations he blocked Iraq-related investigations, charges he denied.

Regarding the 2,100 emails on Clinton’s server found to have contained classified information -- and another 22 “Top Secret” messages containing intelligence deemed too damaging to national security to make public – Krongard questioned how that material got there. He said it would take a deliberate act for the intelligence to ""jump the gap"" between the classified computer networks and Clinton's personal server.

""It could be done by taking a screen shot with … a camera of a classified email, take a screen shot and send it to an unclassified network. It could be copied, but there are restrictions in the State Department and elsewhere as to what copiers can work from a classified network and it can only be a secure copier. So that may not have been easy,"" Krongard said.

Asked if it could happen by accident, Krongard simply said, ""No.""

He also challenged Clinton and State Department claims that the emails in question were “retroactively classified.”

""I don't understand it, because it was either classified by the creator or it was classified by reason of where it came from or what network it was on,” Krongard said.

Clinton consistently has claimed nothing she sent or received was marked classified at the time. While technically correct, this distinction also appears misleading. A January 2009 non-disclosure agreement signed by Clinton confirms her understanding that ""classified information is marked or unmarked.”

Rather, it is the content and source that determine classification. Former intelligence officials say the emails were improperly handled by Clinton and her team and, once reviewed by the authority that originated the information, the emails were given proper classification markings.

While there is no public confirmation the Clinton server was breached, former senior military and intelligence officials -- including Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, and former Defense Intelligence Agency chief Mike Flynn – have said they believe foreign intelligence services targeted Clinton's email system.

The world's institutions are no longer adequate for today's problems

The report, called the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review, was tasked with a broad review of State Department policies. The point was ""not looking at the crisis of the day,"" Tom Perriello, the State Department official tasked with leading the QDDR, said in a press briefing.

Glasser, Alec Macgillis, Michael Chabon, Rachel Aviv, David Remnick, Dexter Filkins","On Monday , Rex Tillerson , the departing Secretary of State , cut short a visit to Africa to fly back to Washington . Before he left , he remarked that the nerve-gas attack recently carried out on a former Russian spy in Salisbury , England , was a “ really egregious act , ” but he also said it wasn ’ t entirely clear who was responsible . Later on Monday , though , the State Department issued a statement in which Tillerson expressed his “ full confidence ” in the British government ’ s assessment that the Russian state was almost certainly the culprit . ( In the House of Commons on Monday , Theresa May , the British Prime Minister , said it was “ highly likely ” that Russia was responsible . )
“ There is never a justification for this type of attack—the attempted murder of a private citizen on the soil of a sovereign nation—and we are outraged that Russia appears to have again engaged in such behavior , ” Tillerson ’ s statement said . “ From Ukraine to Syria—and now the UK—Russia continues to be an irresponsible force of instability in the world , acting with open disregard for the sovereignty of other states and the life of their citizens . We agree that those responsible—both those who committed the crime and those who ordered it—must face appropriately serious consequences . We stand in solidarity with our Allies in the United Kingdom and will continue to coordinate closely our responses . ”
This was arguably the strongest condemnation of Russian behavior that the Trump Administration has ever issued . And it turned out to be one of Tillerson ’ s final official acts as Secretary of State . At 8:44 A.M. on Tuesday , Donald Trump announced Tillerson ’ s firing on Twitter . “ Mike Pompeo , Director of the CIA , will become our new Secretary of State , ” Trump wrote . “ He will do a fantastic job ! Thank you to Rex Tillerson for his service ! Gina Haspel will become the new Director of the CIA , and the first woman so chosen . Congratulations to all ! ”
Some of Trump ’ s aides immediately insisted to reporters that the President hadn ’ t dismissed Tillerson because of the Russia statement . Citing multiple White House officials , the Washington Post reported that the White House informed the Secretary of State on Friday that he was going to be ousted . Zeke Miller , of the Associated Press , subsequently filled out this narrative , reporting via Twitter , “ WH official says chief of staff John Kelly called Tillerson Friday and again on Saturday . Both calls to Tillerson , the official says , warned that Trump was about to take imminent action if he did not step aside . When Tillerson didn ’ t act , Trump fired him. ” In brief remarks to reporters , Trump said he had been thinking about replacing Tillerson for “ a long time , ” because “ We were not thinking the same. ” He also said Tillerson “ will be much happier now . ”
At least one of Tillerson ’ s aides pushed back against this White House narrative , however . Elise Labott , CNN ’ s global-affairs correspondent , reported that Tillerson only found out from Trump ’ s tweet that he was fired . Josh Lederman , of the A.P. , reported , via Twitter , “ We got off the plane with Tillerson less than four hours ago . There was zero indication on flight home that this was imminent. ” The White House reacted quickly to this counter-narrative . By early afternoon , the White House had fired the aide , Steve Goldstein , who contradicted its version of what had happened .
If Tillerson did know that the President was about to can him , his statement on Russia was perhaps a final act of defiance . On Tuesday , the Russian government again denied responsibility for the attack in Salisbury and said it wouldn ’ t respond to British claims unless it was provided with samples of the nerve agent used . Trump also spoke with May , finally , and , after the call , the White House issued a statement saying he agreed with her “ that the Government of the Russian Federation must provide unambiguous answers regarding how this chemical weapon , developed in Russia , came to be used in the United Kingdom. ” However , the statement stopped short of saying Trump agreed with the British assessment that the Russian government was very likely responsible .
It is certainly true that Tillerson ’ s departure wasn ’ t entirely unexpected . Although he has avoided criticizing Trump publicly , behind the scenes the former ExxonMobil C.E.O . hasn ’ t hidden his contempt for the President . Last summer , after Trump gave a wacko speech to the Boy Scouts of America , an organization Tillerson used to lead , Tillerson reportedly came close to resigning . In October , NBC News reported that after a meeting at which Trump called for a tenfold increase in the U.S. nuclear arsenal , Tillerson referred to him as a “ moron ” in a conversation with other officials . One of the NBC reporters would clarify that Tillerson used the term “ fucking moron . ”
After those revelations , which Tillerson didn ’ t explicitly deny , there were frequent suggestions that Trump was considering replacing him with Pompeo , a former Republican congressman . Despite this acrimony , the fact remains that Trump announced Tillerson ’ s firing barely twelve hours after he had forcefully sided with the British government against the Kremlin . Either Trump decided that Tillerson ’ s show of defiance was the last straw , or he was oblivious ( or indifferent ) to the impression that firing him at this juncture would create .
To be sure , there were policy differences between Trump and Tillerson—many of them . In addition to the Iranian nuclear deal , where Tillerson was more supportive than the President , trade and North Korea come to mind immediately . Last week , Tillerson reportedly warned White House officials that Trump ’ s proposal to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports would endanger U.S. national security . On Thursday , just hours before Trump agreed to meet with the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un , Tillerson told the reporters travelling with him in Africa , “ We ’ re a long way from negotiations . ”
Maybe that ’ s why Trump decided to act now , although it wouldn ’ t explain why he waited five days and then made the announcement on Twitter . It ’ s also possible that another factor played into his timing . Early Tuesday morning , the Washington Post reported that Roger Stone , the Republican dirty trickster and longtime Trump adviser , told an associate in the spring of 2016 that “ he had learned from WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange that his organization had obtained emails that would torment senior Democrats such as John Podesta , then campaign chairman for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. ” This conversation took place “ before it was publicly known that hackers had obtained the emails of Podesta and of the Democratic National Committee , ” the story also noted .
As Reince Priebus , the former White House chief of staff , told Fox News ’ s Laura Ingraham , Trump pays a great deal of attention to how the daily news narrative evolves . After the Post ’ s scoop appeared , other news organizations leapt on it , and Stone ’ s name trended on Twitter . In all likelihood , the Post ’ s story , with its implication of possible collusion , would have dominated the day in cable news . But once the news of Tillerson ’ s firing broke , it slipped down the home pages , and Stone dropped off the trending list .
Whatever really happened , the fact is that Tillerson is gone—the first Cabinet secretary ever to be fired by tweet . Given his effort to gut the State Department , and the departure of many senior diplomats with distinguished careers in the department , Tillerson ’ s fall likely won ’ t be lamented in Foggy Bottom , or in many other places . But in the unique and alarming context of this Presidency , he seemed like a stabilizing and independent-minded presence . At least , he wasn ’ t a Trump flunky or a Bannonite ethno-nationalist .
With Tillerson ’ s departure so closely following the resignation of Gary Cohn , the former Goldman Sachs executive who served as Trump ’ s senior economic adviser , the circle around the President is getting even tighter . Pompeo , Tillerson ’ s replacement , is a Trump loyalist who has tried to downplay Russian interference in the 2016 election . And so it goes on .

Ken Allard,"If you thought the long-anticipated Hillary hearings were going to be a feet-to-the fire payback for Benghazigate , then maybe you should think again .
In her back-to-back appearances Wednesday , departing Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton left Senate and House Republicans hitless , winless and basically befuddled . Little Leaguers enjoy a 10-run rule that brings such uneven contests to merciful endings — so the little nippers can lick their wounds and try again another day . If Congress had anything similar , Mrs. Clinton might have ended her testimony hours earlier , beaten rush-hour traffic across town and made it back to Foggy Bottom long before happy hour .
Maybe the Republicans in Congress felt sorry for the former senator from New York , bested by Barack Obama for the presidency , wounded by the Benghazi tragedy and discredited by a damning Accountability Review Board of her State Department stewardship . Republican Sens . Ron Johnson , Rand Paul and John McCain tried their best one-liners against her , slightly recycled from recent campaign rhetoric . Mrs. Clinton answered calmly , projecting an undiminished resolve to correct the security oversights for which she repeatedly assumed responsibility . When pressed too hard by Mr. Johnson , she deftly took his head off , handed it back to him and then kept right on running up the score . Of her hostile questioners , only Mr. McCain emerged with his dignity fully intact .
The House hearing would have been a rerun , except that dispirited Republicans and ebullient Democrats settled down to an utterly predictable pattern of five-minute statements thinly disguised as questions . The only action all afternoon came from watching Mrs. Clinton ’ s head alternate between gracious nods to her oh-so-polite questioners on both sides of the aisle . Apparently , they had watched their Senate colleagues and decided a farewell coronation for Mrs. Clinton was the far safer bet .

If you thought the long-anticipated Hillary hearings were going to be a feet-to-the fire payback for Benghazigate, then maybe you should think again.

In her back-to-back appearances Wednesday, departing Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton left Senate and House Republicans hitless, winless and basically befuddled. Little Leaguers enjoy a 10-run rule that brings such uneven contests to merciful endings — so the little nippers can lick their wounds and try again another day. If Congress had anything similar, Mrs. Clinton might have ended her testimony hours earlier, beaten rush-hour traffic across town and made it back to Foggy Bottom long before happy hour.

Maybe the Republicans in Congress felt sorry for the former senator from New York, bested by Barack Obama for the presidency, wounded by the Benghazi tragedy and discredited by a damning Accountability Review Board of her State Department stewardship. Republican Sens. Ron Johnson, Rand Paul and John McCain tried their best one-liners against her, slightly recycled from recent campaign rhetoric. Mrs. Clinton answered calmly, projecting an undiminished resolve to correct the security oversights for which she repeatedly assumed responsibility. When pressed too hard by Mr. Johnson, she deftly took his head off, handed it back to him and then kept right on running up the score. Of her hostile questioners, only Mr. McCain emerged with his dignity fully intact.

The House hearing would have been a rerun, except that dispirited Republicans and ebullient Democrats settled down to an utterly predictable pattern of five-minute statements thinly disguised as questions. The only action all afternoon came from watching Mrs. Clinton’s head alternate between gracious nods to her oh-so-polite questioners on both sides of the aisle. Apparently, they had watched their Senate colleagues and decided a farewell coronation for Mrs. Clinton was the far safer bet. Even the Hillary Nutcracker doll atop my bookcase seemed to grin more broadly.

Benghazi was only the latest episode of a three-decade epic in which Mrs. Clinton has become one of the great survival stories of American politics. Extending back through the mists of Whitewater, Paula Jones, Troopergate and the unique challenges of being President Bill Clinton’s long-suffering wife, Hillary could have starred in her own soap opera. Instead she kept reinventing herself, epitomizing one of the signature phrases of those years and evolving from first lady to New York senator to presidential candidate to secretary of state. She is the Democrats’ Iron Lady, masterfully preserving her long-range ambitions and options, whatever they might be.

For Republicans savvy enough to give the devil her due, she can also teach some important survival lessons.

First, being smart is much better than the alternative. As K.T. McFarland of Fox News pointed out, Mrs. Clinton was far too shrewd to be mousetrapped into performing the hapless role of administration apologist memorably played by United Nations Ambassador Susan E. Rice. Bill Clinton famously avoided military service during the Vietnam War to maintain his own “political viability.” Mrs. Clinton seems to have the same idea, and she walked out of the hearings this week with her head held high, eclipsing Mrs. Rice, once her all-but-designated successor.

Second, positioning and timing are all-important. Mrs. Clinton has a poker player’s sense of knowing just when to hold ‘em and when to fold ‘em. As a junior senator, she zealously protected defense installations in her district and became a special advocate for New Yorkers serving in uniform. Opposing the Iraq War while campaigning for president, she subsequently became a close political ally of Gen. David H. Petraeus. While such alliances are fleeting, her permanent interest as former secretary of state may be evolving into a latter-day Henry M. “Scoop” Jackson — a long-neglected Democratic vacancy.

Third, the past usually catches up with you when you least expect it. Mrs. Clinton’s announced intention of decompressing may mask another perceptive calculus about sidestepping the challenges of Mr. Obama’s second term. The short list of contradictions includes a resurgent al Qaeda across North Africa, the Syrian powder keg and looming conflict with Iran. Especially with Iran, the potential fallout includes imponderables from cyberwar at your automated teller machine to suicide bombers in American shopping malls. Mr. Obama’s likely successors in either party can surely appreciate what might happen if such cataclysmic events — finally too big to lie about — also shatter the prevailing media-Democratic consensus.

Foreseeable events can sometimes materialize suddenly, creating tectonic shifts in the American political landscape. Mrs. Clinton already understands that, together with something her Republican interlocutors should grasp as well. Benghazi was tragedy, precedent, prologue — all wrapped into one — and is best appreciated not as a “gotcha” but as a benchmark against daunting future challenges.

The US is withdrawing more than half of its staff at its embassy in Cuba in response to mysterious attacks which left its diplomats unwell.

Washington is also warning Americans not to visit the country because some attacks occurred in hotels.

At least 21 staff reported health problems ranging from mild brain trauma and deafness to dizziness and nausea.

Describing the US decision as ""hasty"", Cuba said it would affect bilateral ties but co-operation would continue.

US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the two countries would continue to co-operate in investigating the attacks and said diplomatic ties would be maintained.

Earlier reports suggested that sonic attacks were to blame. Cuba denies any involvement.

At least two Canadians were also affected.

Who is leaving?

The US is ordering all non-essential staff in the embassy in Havana to leave, along with all family members. Only ""emergency personnel"" will remain.

The US has suspended visa processing in Cuba indefinitely.

""Until the government of Cuba can ensure safety of our people, we will be reduced to emergency personnel,"" a US state department official said.

What do we know about the attacks?

""At least 21 employees have been targeted in specific attacks,"" the official said.

Despite an investigation involving the FBI, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Cuban authorities, there is still no full explanation as to the cause of the incidents since late 2016.

""We don't know the means, the methods or how the attacks are being carried out,"" the official said on Friday.

""We have not ruled out the possibility of a third country as a part of the investigation but that investigation continues,"" the official added.

How have US relations with Cuba been?

President Raul Castro had reportedly given his personal assurance to the then-US charge d'affaires in Havana that Cuba was not behind the attacks.

The US reopened its embassy in Havana in 2015 following decades of frozen relations.

In 2016 President Barack Obama became the first sitting US president to visit Cuba since Calvin Coolidge in 1928.

Mcfarland,"Republican Senators and Congressmen thought they finally had a chance to cross-examine Secretary Clinton Wednesday on the Obama administration ’ s failure to provide adequate security for our Benghazi consulate . They thought they could grill her about what happened both before the attacks that killed our ambassador and three others and the failure to mount rescue operations once the attacks began .
Instead , the Secretary turned the tables and chastised Congress for failing to provide adequate funding to protect our people .
She stopped just short of saying the Benghazi attacks were House Republicans ’ fault . It was one of the most masterful political performances in recent times .
How did the Republicans blow it ? Because they ‘ went small ’ in their questions , and looked small and petty for asking them .
The Senators and Congressman should have ‘ gone big ’ instead and expanded the scope of the hearings .
They should have grilled her on how “ leading from behind ” has allowed Islamic extremists and Al Qaeda to hijack the Arab Spring movement .

They thought they could grill her about what happened both before the attacks that killed our ambassador and three others and the failure to mount rescue operations once the attacks began.

Instead, the Secretary turned the tables and chastised Congress for failing to provide adequate funding to protect our people.

She stopped just short of saying the Benghazi attacks were House Republicans’ fault. It was one of the most masterful political performances in recent times.

[pullquote]

How did the Republicans blow it? Because they ‘went small’ in their questions, and looked small and petty for asking them.

The Senators and Congressman should have ‘gone big’ instead and expanded the scope of the hearings.

They should have grilled her on how “leading from behind” has allowed Islamic extremists and Al Qaeda to hijack the Arab Spring movement.

state_department,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/19/benghazi-memos-recovered-from-compound-detail-staf/,Benghazi memos recovered from compound detail staff security worries ,2015-10-19,John Solomon,"In the final weeks before the deadly Benghazi attack in September 2012 , State Department officials serving in the tumultuous Libyan city had increasing worries about safety , reaching out repeatedly to the CIA and Libyan government for extra security and dealing with landlord and guard issues that raised additional red flags , according to documents recovered from the burned-out compound .
The documents , given to The ███ by a U.S. official , provide contemporaneous accounts of career State Department officials coping with an increasingly unstable foreign city and grasping for security help from outsiders in the absence of more action from their own department .
“ In response to threats of a planned attack posted on the Internet , U.S. Mission Benghazi is requesting assistance from the Supreme Security Council , ” Jennifer Larson , the State Department ’ s principal officer for Benghazi , wrote in a May 29 , 2012 , letter to a top Libyan official .
“ U.S . Mission Benghazi is requesting a mobile patrol outside the vicinity of the Mission during hours of darkness , from 2000 to 0700 , ” she added in the letter to Fawzi Wanis , the then-head of the Libyan Supreme Security Council .
Ms. Larson repeated the request in an urgent follow-up on June 6 , 2012 , the same day the Benghazi mission suffered a small bomb attack that became a prelude to the much bigger attack that killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans just three months later .
With just a few diplomatic security officers on scene at the State Department compound in Benghazi , Ms. Larson sought a perimeter patrol by Libyan forces to “ remain in place until further notice , ” the memo shows .
The need to seek security help from the Libyans was necessary because the State Department in Washington repeatedly turned down requests for more safety resources , according to the former head of the U.S. site security team in Libya at the time .
“ They gave us nothing to work with . We had to resource everything we could with what we had in front of us , contracting with the locals , seeking the agency ’ s help and working with meager internal resources , ” said Lt. Col. Andrew Wood , a special forces reserve officer who tried several times to fortify the weak security at Benghazi in 2012 .
State Department officials in Washington “ had their minds made up . They were not going to provide additional security there , period , ” he said in an interview Monday with The Times .
State Department officials declined to discuss the memos , deferring to multiple investigations that have concluded there was inadequate security at the compound when it was attacked on Sept. 11 , 2012 .
Officials said , however , they have made numerous improvements at high-risk diplomatic compounds worldwide since .
“ We can not guarantee that attacks won ’ t happen again , but we can take steps to try to prevent them and mitigate risk . And that ’ s what we ’ re doing , ” the State Department said in a statement to The Times .
Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is slated to testify Thursday before a special House committee chaired by Rep. Trey Gowdy empaneled to look at the security lapses that preceded Benghazi .
The memos show that the deteriorating security at Benghazi not only concerned State Department officials working there , but also the Libyan landlords who rented the two villas comprising a large portion of the compound .
One of the landlords demanded more money for rent , while the other asked to be released from the rental agreement in the summer preceding the attacks , the memos show .
“ The owner has requested to write to you to consider the termination of the lease contract on the end of the first term July 31 , 2012 , ” a representative for one of the landlords wrote on June 18 , 2012 . “ Regrettable due to family and personal reasons . ”
That landlord owned the part of the complex known as Villa C , which constituted the main working place for the complex and the location where Stevens died in a blaze . The landlord expressed increased concerns for his family ’ s safety and the safety of his villa if Americans continued to occupy it , a U.S. official told The Times .
The owner of the second complex , Villa B , also began raising concerns around the same time . In a letter contained in the Benghazi compound staff files , the landlord demanded higher rent after discovering the other landlord was getting paid more for his complex .
“ In addition to extra works of which we bear all expenses as you already know , and whereas the price of this property differs from that of the neighboring property and that this amount of rent does not cover the agreed upon charges , we look forward for good cooperation by suggesting to you either increasing the amount of rent or regretfully terminate the contract , ” the landlord wrote in an April 7 , 2012 , letter .
Officials said that rent dispute carried through the summer unresolved and had become more intense shortly before the attack occurred . The amount of money in dispute reached $ 100,000 by late summer , and the landlord ’ s representatives warned State officials that they would “ be sorry if you don ’ t pay rent and pay more , ” according to a U.S. official directly familiar with the situation .
State Department officials confirmed the rental dispute and said it was going through a mitigation process aimed at settling the issues when the attack occurred .
Col. Wood , the security expert , said he became aware of the landlords ’ concerns and considered them a red flag indicating local Libyans were worried about being affiliated with the U.S . He became even more alarmed when local Libyan security guards began expressing concerns about showing up for work for fear of their safety .
“ It did come up that they ( the landlord and his representatives ) were asking for more money , ” he recalled . “ There were several other indicators that went on that suggested an attack was imminent . The contract security guards were saying their moms are telling them ‘ Don ’ t go to work , it is too dangerous . That was a huge indicator . ”
Col. Wood said he brought the concerns to Stevens in late summer .
“ I told this to Mr. Stevens himself , in front of a big meeting . I said ‘ You are going to get attacked and you are going to get attacked in Benghazi , ’ ” he said .
The run-of-the-mill memos provide an unusually personal window into the pressures and concerns of the everyday U.S. staff in Benghazi before the deadly attack . They paint a poignant picture of an American team seeking the help of Libyan locals and CIA counterparts to ensure their safety in the absence of more resources from Washington .
Those missing resources included more heavy-duty armaments , more American security personnel and U.S. air support for evacuation in case of an attack .
The resource concerns are further laid bare in a CIA memo sent to the field in Benghazi shortly before the attack , which made clear the strategy for U.S. personnel was essentially a fend-for-yourself edict from Washington .
“ The primary course of action for officers operating in Libya during a personnel recovery scenario should be to move away from the enemy activity as there is no mechanism/authorities in place for the field to leverage Emergency Close Air Support , ” the memo warned . “ The base should be prepared to recover its officers with local resources within its capabilities and limitations . ”
CIA security officers told the House Intelligence Committee during an after-action report that the State Department compound was far less secure than the agency ’ s own buildings and that diplomatic security agents feared they were ill equipped to respond to an armed attack against the mission . The local State Department employees repeatedly sought help from CIA to try to fortify a compound with clear security weaknesses .
The lack of preparation and resources persisted , even as CIA produced more than four dozen pieces of confirmed intelligence that reported on increasing threats against Americans and Westerners in Benghazi and documented more than 20 attempted attacks in the area just before the fiery assault on the compound on Sept. 11 .
“ CIA security personnel testified that State Department DS ( diplomatic security ) agents repeatedly stated they felt ill-equipped and ill-trained to contend with the threat environment in Benghazi , ” the report said .
“ The DS agents knew well before the attacks that they could not defend the TMF against an armed assault . The DS agents also told CIA about their requests for additional resources that were pending , ” it said .
Stevens , a respected career diplomat , was aware before he left Tripoli to visit Benghazi for a ceremony that the city was in worsening security shape .
The morning before he died , his final cable to Mrs. Clinton described an increasingly violent city and his own fears that the local Libyan forces guarding the complex might not adequately ensure the safety of State Department personnel .
Militia leaders told U.S. officials just two days before the attack that they were angered by U.S. support of a particular candidate for Libyan prime minister and warned “ they would not continue to guarantee security in Benghazi , a critical function they asserted they were currently providing , ” Stevens wrote the morning of the attack .
The various investigations of Benghazi have concluded that the local Libyan forces at the compound did not effectively deter the attack and that the State Department ’ s heavy reliance on foreign security forces for such a high-risk location was a flawed strategy .
The State Department ’ s own accountability review board made 29 recommendations for improving security , including that the agency “ implement a plan to strengthen security beyond reliance on host government security support ” for high-risk , high-threat ( HRHT ) posts .
Though more than two years old , that recommendation has not been fully implemented by the Diplomatic Security office , the State Department ’ s inspector general recently warned .
“ Although DS has not developed a plan for strengthening security at HRHT posts as Recommendation 12 recommends , it has undertaken several initiatives directed at the recommendation ’ s intent , including enhanced personnel training , increased use of the Deliberate Planning Process , expansion of the Marine security guard ( MSG ) program and revision of its mission , and closer coordination and cooperation with DOD , ” the inspector general reported in a little-noticed memo released in late August when most of official Washington was on vacation .
The IG , the agency ’ s internal watchdog , also noted that State had outright rejected one of its recommendations for improved security : to develop mandatory minimum security standards for high-risk outposts .
“ Recommendation 17 of the ARB process review report recommended that the Department develop minimum security standards that must be met prior to occupying facilities in HRHT locations , ” the IG noted . “ The Department rejected this recommendation , stating that existing Overseas Security Policy Board standards apply to all posts and that separate security standards for HRHT posts would not provide better or more secure operating environments . ”
The IG said it disagrees with that assessment and “ the department ’ s response does not meet the recommendation ’ s requirement for standards that must be met prior to occupancy. ” As a result , the watchdog has reissued that recommendation and urged State to take action .
State Department spokesman Alec Gerlach told The Times that State has taken all the security recommendations seriously and “ implemented new procedures to address high-threat posts , procured critical security assets and engaged Congress to secure increased funding for embassy security . ”
But he acknowledged some of the recommendations have not been fully implemented yet .
“ We adopted all the ARB ’ s 29 recommendations and are committed to implementing each , ” he said . “ We have closed 26 of 29 recommendations , some of which require long-term technical upgrades . The remaining three are in progress . ”","In the final weeks before the deadly Benghazi attack in September 2012, State Department officials serving in the tumultuous Libyan city had increasing worries about safety, reaching out repeatedly to the CIA and Libyan government for extra security and dealing with landlord and guard issues that raised additional red flags, according to documents recovered from the burned-out compound.

“ There was personal blowback . Personal blowback to me , to my family , to my office , ” former Intelligence Community Inspector General Charles McCullough III said .
The Obama appointee discussed his role in the Clinton email probe for the first time on television , during an exclusive interview with Fox News aired on `` Tucker Carlson Tonight . '' McCullough – who came to the inspector general position with more than two decades of experience at the FBI , Treasury and intelligence community – shed light on how quickly the probe was politicized and his office was marginalized by Democrats .
In January 2016 , after McCullough told the Republican leadership on the Senate intelligence and foreign affairs committees that emails beyond the “ Top Secret ” level passed through the former secretary of state 's unsecured personal server , the backlash intensified .
“ All of a sudden I became a shill of the right , ” McCullough recalled . “ And I was told by members of Congress , ‘ Be careful . You 're losing your credibility . You need to be careful . There are people out to get you . ’ ”
But the former inspector general , with responsibility for the 17 intelligence agencies , said the executive who recommended him to the Obama administration for the job – then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper – was also disturbed by the independent Clinton email findings .
“ [ Clapper ] said , ‘ This is extremely reckless. ’ And he mentioned something about -- the campaign … will have heartburn about that , ” McCullough said .
He said Clapper 's Clinton email comments came during an in-person meeting about a year before the presidential election – in late December 2015 or early 2016 . “ [ Clapper ] was as off-put as the rest of us were . ”
After the Clapper meeting , McCullough said his team was marginalized . “ I was told by senior officials to keep [ Clapper ] out of it , ” he said , while acknowledging he tried to keep his boss in the loop .
As one of the few people who viewed the 22 top secret Clinton emails deemed too classified to release under any circumstances , the former IG said , “ There was a very good reason to withhold those emails ... there would have been harm to national security. ” McCullough went further , telling Fox News that “ sources and methods , lives and operations ” could be put at risk .
Some of those email exchanges contained Special Access Program ( SAP ) information characterized by intel experts as “ above top secret . ”
“ I was told by members of Congress , ‘ Be careful . You 're losing your credibility . You need to be careful . There are people out to get you. ’ ” — Former Intelligence Community Inspector General Charles McCullough III
WikiLeaks documents show the campaign was formulating talking points as the review of 30,000 Clinton emails was ongoing .
The campaign team wrote in August 2015 that “ Clinton only used her account for unclassified email . When information is reviewed for public release , it is common for information previously unclassified to be upgraded to classified . ”
McCullough was critical of the campaign ’ s response , as the classified review had barely begun . “ There was an effort … certainly on the part of the campaign , to mislead people into thinking that there was nothing to see here , ” McCullough said .
In March 2016 , seven senior Democrats sent a letter to McCullough and his State Department counterpart , saying they had serious questions about the impartiality of the Clinton email review . However , McCullough was not making the decisions on what material in Clinton ’ s emails was classified -- he was passing along the findings of the individual agencies who got the intelligence and have final say on classification .
“ I think there was certainly a coordinated strategy , ” McCullough said .
McCullough described one confrontation with Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein 's office just six weeks before the election , amid pressure to respond to the letter – which Feinstein had co-signed .
“ I thought that any response to that letter would just hyper-politicize the situation , ” McCullough said . “ I recall even offering to resign , to the staff director . I said , ‘ Tell [ Feinstein ] I 'll resign tonight . I 'd be happy to go . I 'm not going to respond to that letter . It 's just that simple . ”
As Election Day approached , McCullough said the threats went further , singling out him and another senior government investigator on the email case .
“ It was told in no uncertain terms , by a source directly from the campaign , that we would be the first two to be fired -- with [ Clinton ’ s ] administration . That that was definitely going to happen , ” he said .
McCullough said he was just trying to do his job , which requires independence . `` I was , in this context , a whistleblower . I was explaining to Congress -- I was doing exactly what they had expected me to do . Exactly what I promised them I would do during my confirmation hearing , ” he said . “ ... This was a political matter , and all of a sudden I was the enemy . ''
He said pressures also increased early on from Clinton ’ s former team at the State Department , especially top official Patrick Kennedy .
`` State Department management did n't want us there , ” McCullough said . “ We knew we had had a security problem at this point . We had a possible compromise . ''
Speaking about the case more than a year after the FBI probe concluded , McCullough in his interview also addressed the possibility that a more cooperative State Department and Clinton campaign might have precluded the FBI ’ s involvement from the start .
“ Had they come in with the server willingly , without having us to refer this to the bureau … maybe we could have worked with the State Department , ” he said .
More than 2,100 classified emails passed through Clinton 's personal server , which was used exclusively for government business . No one has been charged .
Asked what would have happened to him if he had done such a thing , McCullough said : “ I 'd be sitting in Leavenworth right now . ”

“I was told by members of Congress, ‘Be careful. You're losing your credibility. You need to be careful. There are people out to get you.’” — Former Intelligence Community Inspector General Charles McCullough III

WikiLeaks documents show the campaign was formulating talking points as the review of 30,000 Clinton emails was ongoing.

The campaign team wrote in August 2015 that “Clinton only used her account for unclassified email. When information is reviewed for public release, it is common for information previously unclassified to be upgraded to classified.”

McCullough was critical of the campaign’s response, as the classified review had barely begun. “There was an effort … certainly on the part of the campaign, to mislead people into thinking that there was nothing to see here,” McCullough said.

In March 2016, seven senior Democrats sent a letter to McCullough and his State Department counterpart, saying they had serious questions about the impartiality of the Clinton email review. However, McCullough was not making the decisions on what material in Clinton’s emails was classified -- he was passing along the findings of the individual agencies who got the intelligence and have final say on classification.

“I think there was certainly a coordinated strategy,” McCullough said.

McCullough described one confrontation with Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein's office just six weeks before the election, amid pressure to respond to the letter – which Feinstein had co-signed.

“I thought that any response to that letter would just hyper-politicize the situation,” McCullough said. “I recall even offering to resign, to the staff director. I said, ‘Tell [Feinstein] I'll resign tonight. I'd be happy to go. I'm not going to respond to that letter. It's just that simple.”

As Election Day approached, McCullough said the threats went further, singling out him and another senior government investigator on the email case.

“It was told in no uncertain terms, by a source directly from the campaign, that we would be the first two to be fired -- with [Clinton’s] administration. That that was definitely going to happen,” he said.

McCullough said he was just trying to do his job, which requires independence. ""I was, in this context, a whistleblower. I was explaining to Congress -- I was doing exactly what they had expected me to do. Exactly what I promised them I would do during my confirmation hearing,” he said. “... This was a political matter, and all of a sudden I was the enemy.""

He said pressures also increased early on from Clinton’s former team at the State Department, especially top official Patrick Kennedy.

""State Department management didn't want us there,” McCullough said. “We knew we had had a security problem at this point. We had a possible compromise.""

Speaking about the case more than a year after the FBI probe concluded, McCullough in his interview also addressed the possibility that a more cooperative State Department and Clinton campaign might have precluded the FBI’s involvement from the start.

“Had they come in with the server willingly, without having us to refer this to the bureau … maybe we could have worked with the State Department,” he said.

More than 2,100 classified emails passed through Clinton's personal server, which was used exclusively for government business. No one has been charged.

Asked what would have happened to him if he had done such a thing, McCullough said: “I'd be sitting in Leavenworth right now.”

Clinton spent the better part of last September 11 trying to get a handle on security at several other U.S. embassies in the Middle East where anti-American protests were in full swing over an anti-Muslim film produced in the United States .
She said the U.S. embassy was `` under assault '' by crowds trying to scale the wall . American embassies in Yemen and Tunisia were also facing a `` serious threat . Clinton personally called the president of Tunisia , she said , to `` beg him to send reinforcements , which he did , to finally save our embassy . ''
By 4 p.m. that day , Clinton was notified about the Benghazi attack . In the coming hours , she was in meetings and spoke with staff , the American Embassy in Tripoli and other U.S. officials .
Directing the U.S. response from the State Department , Clinton stayed in touch with officials across the administration and with the Libyan government .
She instructed her staff to `` consider every option , to just break down the doors of the Libyan officials to get as much security support as we possibly could . ''
Clinton said in the hours and days following the attack in Benghazi , there were `` no delays in decision-making . No denials of support from Washington or from our military , '' something an independent board established to review the matter cited in its report .
2 . U.S. diplomatic posts in some 20 countries under threat
`` Sitting here today , we probably have at least 20 other posts that are under a serious threat environment as I speak to you , '' she told senators . `` We operate in places where we know that our facilities are being surveilled for potential attacks where we have a steady Intel stream of plotting . ''
Clinton detailed what the State Department has done to begin implementing the 29 recommendations of the Accountability Review Board to improve security at diplomatic posts in high-threat areas , in addition to a few of her own .

Specifically , Clinton has appointed a team , led by her deputy , to focus on tightening security , sent joint teams of military special forces and diplomatic security threat analysts to more than a dozen high-risk posts and appointed a senior official to focus exclusively on those areas .
The State Department is also working to streamline requests for security so they make their way more quickly up the chain of leadership .
Despite the threat , Clinton stressed the importance of U.S. leadership and diplomatic presence in the Middle East .
`` We 've come a long way in the past four years , and we can not afford to retreat now , '' Clinton told senators . `` When America is absent , especially from unstable environments , there are consequences . Extremism takes root , our interests suffer , our security at home is threatened . ''
Clinton grew emotional and held back tears when talking about U.S. personnel killed in the Benghazi attack .
`` For me , this is not just a matter of policy , it 's personal . I stood next to President Obama as the Marines carried those flag-draped caskets off the plane at Andrews , '' Clinton said as she choked back tears . `` I put my arms around the mothers and fathers , the sisters and brothers , the sons and daughters , and the wives left alone to raise their children . ''
But she lost patience with the focus of Republican senators on talking points used by U.N . Ambassador Susan Rice on the next Sunday 's talk shows that focused on a protest at the U.S. post in Benghazi , which turned out not to have taken place .
When Sen. Ron Johnson pressed Clinton on why the State Department did n't call U.S. personnel who were evacuated from Benghazi to determine whether there was a protest , Clinton took him to task .
`` With all due respect , the fact is we had four dead Americans , '' Clinton reminded Johnson as she banged her hand on the table .
`` Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night decided they 'd go kill some Americans ? What difference , at this point , does it make ? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening , '' she said .
4 . Militants in Mali and Algeria have arms from Libya
Clinton warned the security situation in northern Mali , where international forces are battling militants , has been exacerbated by flow of weapons from neighboring Libya following the fall of Moammar Gadhafi .
She said there was `` no doubt '' such weapons were also used in an attack by militants on an Algerian natural gas plant last week .
She noted the aftermath of the Arab spring has changed power dynamics and stretched security forces across the region thin .
Calling the campaign struggle against the Islamic fighters a necessary response to `` a very serious , ongoing threat , '' Clinton said the `` United States can not permit northern Mali to become a safe-haven for Islamist rebels that could eventually pose a more direct threat to U.S . interests . ''
Noting the increased strength of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb , the regional affiliate of the al Qaeda network fighting along side local Malians , Clinton warned that the United States must prepare for the possibility that groups like AQIM could threaten direct attacks on U.S. interests as they gain power .
`` You ca n't say because they have n't done something they 're not going to do it , '' Clinton said . `` This is not only a terrorist syndicate , it is a criminal enterprise . So make no mistake about it , we 've got to have a better strategy . ''
While their tone was generally respectful , several Republican senators made clear they were unsatisfied with Clinton 's answers .
Sen. John McCain , R-Arizona , one of the administration 's toughest critics since the Benghazi attack , took Clinton to task for what he considered lackluster attention to the growing threat in Benghazi .
McCain wanted to know why Clinton had n't read a cable from Ambassador Christopher Stevens warning that the mission in Benghazi could not survive a sustained assault .
Sen. Rand Paul said it would have been an offense worthy of firing Clinton had he been president .
McCain also blasted Clinton 's answers to questions about the administration 's claim that a protest had taken place in Benghazi .
`` The American people deserve to know answers , and they certainly do n't deserve false answers , '' McCain told Clinton .
Clinton was more diplomatic with her old friend , saying she respected his strong feelings for the incident given his own relationship with Stevens , but that they disagreed about what happened and when it happened with respect to explaining events .
In addition to lessons the State Department learned about improving security at diplomatic posts , Clinton , who called the Benghazi attack an act of terrorism since Day One , suggested the administration might learn another lesson .
`` Just withhold . Do n't say what you do n't know for sure until it 's finally decided . ''","Story highlights Hillary Clinton testifies for more than five hours before two congressional committees

Clinton, at one point, grew exasperated with line of questioning over Benghazi response

Some Republican lawmakers say they are not satisfied with Clinton's answers

Four Americans killed in September 11 attack, including U.S. ambassador to Libya

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Wednesday took on Republican congressional critics of her department's handling of the deadly September terrorist attack in Libya.

Conservative GOP members challenged Clinton on the lack of security at the diplomatic compound in Benghazi as well as the erroneous account that the attack grew spontaneously from a protest over an anti-Islam film produced in the United States.

At two hearings, which together totaled more than five hours, Clinton acknowledged a ""systemic breakdown"" cited by an independent review of issues leading up to the armed assault and said her department was taking additional steps to increase security at U.S. diplomatic facilities.

Clinton grew emotional and held back tears when talking about U.S. personnel killed in the Benghazi attack.

""For me, this is not just a matter of policy, it's personal. I stood next to President Obama as the Marines carried those flag-draped caskets off the plane at Andrews,"" Clinton said as she choked back tears. ""I put my arms around the mothers and fathers, the sisters and brothers, the sons and daughters, and the wives left alone to raise their children.""

But she lost patience with the focus of Republican senators on talking points used by U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice on the next Sunday's talk shows that focused on a protest at the U.S. post in Benghazi, which turned out not to have taken place.

When Sen. Ron Johnson pressed Clinton on why the State Department didn't call U.S. personnel who were evacuated from Benghazi to determine whether there was a protest, Clinton took him to task.

""With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans,"" Clinton reminded Johnson as she banged her hand on the table.

""Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night decided they'd go kill some Americans? What difference, at this point, does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening,"" she said.

4. Militants in Mali and Algeria have arms from Libya

Clinton warned the security situation in northern Mali, where international forces are battling militants, has been exacerbated by flow of weapons from neighboring Libya following the fall of Moammar Gadhafi.

She said there was ""no doubt"" such weapons were also used in an attack by militants on an Algerian natural gas plant last week.

She noted the aftermath of the Arab spring has changed power dynamics and stretched security forces across the region thin.

Calling the campaign struggle against the Islamic fighters a necessary response to ""a very serious, ongoing threat,"" Clinton said the ""United States cannot permit northern Mali to become a safe-haven for Islamist rebels that could eventually pose a more direct threat to U.S. interests.""

Noting the increased strength of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the regional affiliate of the al Qaeda network fighting along side local Malians, Clinton warned that the United States must prepare for the possibility that groups like AQIM could threaten direct attacks on U.S. interests as they gain power.

""You can't say because they haven't done something they're not going to do it,"" Clinton said. ""This is not only a terrorist syndicate, it is a criminal enterprise. So make no mistake about it, we've got to have a better strategy.""

5. Republicans still aren't buying it

While their tone was generally respectful, several Republican senators made clear they were unsatisfied with Clinton's answers.

Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, one of the administration's toughest critics since the Benghazi attack, took Clinton to task for what he considered lackluster attention to the growing threat in Benghazi.

McCain wanted to know why Clinton hadn't read a cable from Ambassador Christopher Stevens warning that the mission in Benghazi could not survive a sustained assault.

Sen. Rand Paul said it would have been an offense worthy of firing Clinton had he been president.

McCain also blasted Clinton's answers to questions about the administration's claim that a protest had taken place in Benghazi.

""The American people deserve to know answers, and they certainly don't deserve false answers,"" McCain told Clinton.

Clinton was more diplomatic with her old friend, saying she respected his strong feelings for the incident given his own relationship with Stevens, but that they disagreed about what happened and when it happened with respect to explaining events.

In addition to lessons the State Department learned about improving security at diplomatic posts, Clinton, who called the Benghazi attack an act of terrorism since Day One, suggested the administration might learn another lesson.

A global travel alert issued Friday by the State Department warned al Qaeda may launch attacks in the Middle East , North Africa and beyond in coming weeks , a threat that prompted Sunday 's closure of 21 embassies and consulates .

Donald Trump has said that US relations with Russia may be at “ an all-time low ” and declared a new-found faith in Nato , suggesting the alliance was “ no longer obsolete ” .
The US president ’ s remarks at the White House followed a two-hour meeting in Moscow between his secretary of state , Rex Tillerson , and Vladimir Putin , which failed to resolve any of the deep differences between the two nations on Syria , Ukraine , or Moscow ’ s interference in the 2016 US election .
'No longer obsolete ' : Trump backtracks on Nato with Russia tensions rising Read more
“ We ’ re not getting along with Russia at all , ” Trump said , adding “ we may be at an all-time low ” . He avoided any direct criticism of Putin , but compared the relationship with Russia unfavourably to the one he had cultivated with China since the visit of Xi Jinping last week .
Russia , Trump noted , had vetoed a US-backed resolution on Syria at the UN security council while China had abstained , adding that he was “ not surprised ” by Beijing ’ s stance – implying he had negotiated it with Xi .
In the latest of a series of dramatic foreign policy reversals in recent days , Trump dropped an allegation he had repeated throughout his presidential campaign , telling the Wall Street Journal that the Chinese were “ not currency manipulators ” .
The president ’ s comments confirmed a significant shift in his positions since taking office nearly three months ago , cooling towards Russia and reaffirming support for Nato .
A day after approving Nato ’ s latest expansion with the accession of Montenegro , a source of fury in Moscow , Trump used a joint appearance with the alliance ’ s secretary general , Jens Stoltenberg , to distance himself from his past denigration of Nato , while claiming credit for improving its performance .
“ I complained about that a long time ago and they made a change , and now they do fight terrorism , ” the president said . “ I said it was obsolete . It ’ s no longer obsolete . ”
Tillerson ’ s two-hour audience with Putin in the Kremlin led to the removal of the most immediate threat of escalation , as Putin “ reaffirmed ” the maintenance of a hotline between the two countries ’ militaries to avoid midair collisions between their aircraft operating in Syrian airspace .
Putin meets with Rex Tillerson in Russia amid escalating tensions over Syria Read more
America ’ s top diplomat said the two countries had agreed to create a working group to find solutions to “ smaller problems ” so that they could then concentrate on bigger issues .

Donald Trump has said that US relations with Russia may be at “an all-time low” and declared a new-found faith in Nato, suggesting the alliance was “no longer obsolete”.

The US president’s remarks at the White House followed a two-hour meeting in Moscow between his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, and Vladimir Putin, which failed to resolve any of the deep differences between the two nations on Syria, Ukraine, or Moscow’s interference in the 2016 US election.

'No longer obsolete': Trump backtracks on Nato with Russia tensions rising Read more

“We’re not getting along with Russia at all,” Trump said, adding “we may be at an all-time low”. He avoided any direct criticism of Putin, but compared the relationship with Russia unfavourably to the one he had cultivated with China since the visit of Xi Jinping last week.

Russia, Trump noted, had vetoed a US-backed resolution on Syria at the UN security council while China had abstained, adding that he was “not surprised” by Beijing’s stance – implying he had negotiated it with Xi.

In the latest of a series of dramatic foreign policy reversals in recent days, Trump dropped an allegation he had repeated throughout his presidential campaign, telling the Wall Street Journal that the Chinese were “not currency manipulators”.

The president’s comments confirmed a significant shift in his positions since taking office nearly three months ago, cooling towards Russia and reaffirming support for Nato.

A day after approving Nato’s latest expansion with the accession of Montenegro, a source of fury in Moscow, Trump used a joint appearance with the alliance’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, to distance himself from his past denigration of Nato, while claiming credit for improving its performance.



“I complained about that a long time ago and they made a change, and now they do fight terrorism,” the president said. “I said it was obsolete. It’s no longer obsolete.”

Tillerson’s two-hour audience with Putin in the Kremlin led to the removal of the most immediate threat of escalation, as Putin “reaffirmed” the maintenance of a hotline between the two countries’ militaries to avoid midair collisions between their aircraft operating in Syrian airspace.

America’s top diplomat said the two countries had agreed to create a working group to find solutions to “smaller problems” so that they could then concentrate on bigger issues.

But as he sat alongside his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, at a press conference, it was clear that fundamental differences between the US and Russia on Syria and beyond remained very much in place.

“I expressed the view that the current state of US-Russian relations is at a low point,” Tillerson said. “The world’s two foremost nuclear powers cannot have this kind of relationship.”

“The perspective from the US is supported by facts we have that are conclusive that the chemical attack was planned and directed and executed by Syrian regime forces,” Tillerson said, adding that the “reign of the Assad family is coming to an end” and “Russia perhaps has the best means of helping the Assad regime recognise this reality”.

By 1990 , with the loss of their Soviet patron and its $ 5 billion annual subsidy , Raúl ’ s doubts crystallized into alarm even while his brother Fidel hunkered down , resisting reform . And though Raúl took power in 2006 , it would be six years before he could finally overrule his ailing brother , who turned 89 years old on Thursday .
“ There has been a sibling tug of war between Raúl and Fidel since childhood , ” Domingo Amuchastegui , a former Cuban intelligence officer , tells me over lunch this summer at Versailles , the restaurant that serves as the mecca of Cuban life in Miami . Versailles bills itself as the “ most famous Cuban restaurant in the world , ” and Amuchastegui is no stranger to its mirrored dining room . I ’ ve learned over more than two decades of covering Cuba that Amuchastegui has uncommon insights into the Caribbean island that has bedeviled every American president since Dwight Eisenhower . Indeed , he is that rare breed of defector who somehow manages to regularly visit his homeland . As Amuchastegui carefully parses it over lunch , Raúl has long contended with “ Fidel as the No . 1 braking system . ”
For more than a half century , Raúl Castro , Fidel ’ s comrade-for-life and chief of the Cuban Armed Forces , lived and worked cheerfully in the shadow of his elder sibling . Not only was Raúl the rare politician contented to be No . 2 , he bolted from the limelight—his brother ’ s oxygen—like a vampire escaping the dawn . “ Raúl always consults with me about all the important questions , ” Fidel Castro assured an American journalist in 1964 , lest anyone doubt who was the boss . “ Of course , ” he hastened to add , “ the constant presence of one outstanding leader tends to obscure the rest . ”
And so it was . Or , at least , so it was for most of Raúl ’ s life .
The chance to override Fidel ’ s brake finally came last October—amid secret negotiations between the U.S. and Cuba—when a wobbly Venezuela slashed its daily oil subsidy to the island nation . The writing was on the wall : The island was running out of patrons . But the fates once again favored Cuba . President Barack Obama told his negotiating team he wanted a deal ( just about any deal , his critics contend ) .
For 18 months , American and Cuban officials had rendezvoused in cloak-and-dagger meetings in Toronto , Ottawa and the Vatican , pulling off what many believed was unthinkable while the Castro brothers lived—a restoration of relations between the longtime enemies .

By 1990, with the loss of their Soviet patron and its $5 billion annual subsidy, Raúl’s doubts crystallized into alarm even while his brother Fidel hunkered down, resisting reform. And though Raúl took power in 2006, it would be six years before he could finally overrule his ailing brother, who turned 89 years old on Thursday.

“There has been a sibling tug of war between Raúl and Fidel since childhood,” Domingo Amuchastegui, a former Cuban intelligence officer, tells me over lunch this summer at Versailles, the restaurant that serves as the mecca of Cuban life in Miami. Versailles bills itself as the “most famous Cuban restaurant in the world,” and Amuchastegui is no stranger to its mirrored dining room. I’ve learned over more than two decades of covering Cuba that Amuchastegui has uncommon insights into the Caribbean island that has bedeviled every American president since Dwight Eisenhower. Indeed, he is that rare breed of defector who somehow manages to regularly visit his homeland. As Amuchastegui carefully parses it over lunch, Raúl has long contended with “Fidel as the No. 1 braking system.”

Story Continued Below

For more than a half century, Raúl Castro, Fidel’s comrade-for-life and chief of the Cuban Armed Forces, lived and worked cheerfully in the shadow of his elder sibling. Not only was Raúl the rare politician contented to be No. 2, he bolted from the limelight—his brother’s oxygen—like a vampire escaping the dawn. “Raúl always consults with me about all the important questions,” Fidel Castro assured an American journalist in 1964, lest anyone doubt who was the boss. “Of course,” he hastened to add, “the constant presence of one outstanding leader tends to obscure the rest.”

And so it was. Or, at least, so it was for most of Raúl’s life.

The chance to override Fidel’s brake finally came last October—amid secret negotiations between the U.S. and Cuba—when a wobbly Venezuela slashed its daily oil subsidy to the island nation. The writing was on the wall: The island was running out of patrons. But the fates once again favored Cuba. President Barack Obama told his negotiating team he wanted a deal (just about any deal, his critics contend).

For 18 months, American and Cuban officials had rendezvoused in cloak-and-dagger meetings in Toronto, Ottawa and the Vatican, pulling off what many believed was unthinkable while the Castro brothers lived—a restoration of relations between the longtime enemies. (Almost as astonishing was that both sides, famously indiscreet, kept their year-and-a-half-long negotiations a secret.) It was a seismic shift in geopolitics, one that awakened an astonished world that had become resigned to frozen non-relations between U.S. and Cuba.

On July 20, the Cuban flag rose over its newly restored Embassy on 16 th Street, NW, in Washington with Secretary of State John Kerry among the 500 attendees—a ceremony that will reprise on Friday morning when the American flag will be hoisted over the newly re-christened U.S. Embassy in Havana.

The twin moments highlight the remarkable political transformation of Raúl Castro—a zealot communist (and unrepentant Stalinist) throughout the 1970s who has morphed into a formidable agent of change, deftly negotiating an end to the Cold War with his northern nemesis. “I don’t think we have so much a new Raúl,” says John Caufield, the U.S.’s top diplomat in Havana at the nation’s Interests Section (now the embassy) from 2010 to 2014, “as Raúl being able to be himself, not being in the shadow of Fidel.”

And what a deal he has made with the United States, scoring the big-ticket items on his wish list: the release of the remaining Cuban Five prisoners, an avalanche of American tourists and their cash, a huge uptick in remittances and investment capital, while sliding off the U.S.’s state-sponsored terrorist list.

At the same time, he kiboshed most of the U.S. demands—open elections, human rights’ guarantees, $7 billion in U.S. property claims, an independent media and accessible Internet.

state_department,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/24/hillary-clintons-secret-email-server-timeline-refu/,New documents refute Hillary Clinton’s secret email server timeline,2016-03-24,Stephen Dinan,"Documents confirm Hillary Clinton was using her secret email server before the March 18 start date she previously claimed , and the State Department had access to some of the messages all along but didn ’ t notice , a conservative legal watchdog said Thursday .
Judicial Watch , which has filed a host of lawsuits to try to pry loose Mrs. Clinton ’ s emails , released a Feb. 13 exchange between Mrs. Clinton , the new secretary of state , and aide Cheryl Mills concerning Mrs. Clinton ’ s desire for a secure BlackBerry to handle classified email traffic .
Last year , Mrs. Clinton indicated she started using her secret account on the clintonemail.com server she kept at her home in New York in March , two months after she was sworn in as secretary .
But the email discovery confirms reports last year that she was using the account before that date . She emailed David H. Petraeus , who was serving as CIA director , from her secret account that January .
The email released Thursday by Judicial Watch was sent to Ms. Mills at her official State Department address , meaning the department has had it in its possession all along — though it did not provide it to the conservative legal group until last week .
“ It ’ s another dirty little secret that the State Department hoped nobody would notice , ” said Tom Fitton , president of Judicial Watch , who has filed a lawsuit demanding that the department go back and search for more such emails .
Mrs. Clinton had said all of the official record emails from her first two months as secretary , which she was required by law to store and leave in the department archives , are no longer available to her . But the Mills email shows the State Department itself may be sitting on a number of those messages .
The department did not comment on whether it would go back to look for more Clinton emails . Last month , it finished processing some 30,000 messages Mrs. Clinton did return to the government nearly two years after she left office .
Mrs. Clinton ’ s presidential campaign didn ’ t respond to a request seeking comment on the discrepancy in her email use .
The State Department has acknowledged gaps in records of Mrs. Clinton ’ s communications — particularly at the start of her tenure . An official said Thursday that the department is relying on Mrs. Clinton ’ s own representations about her account use .
“ Secretary Clinton and her team have indicated that they provided the department with all work-related emails in her possession from her time at the department , ” the official said .
The FBI and the State Department ’ s inspector general are looking into Mrs. Clinton ’ s email server and whether classified information was sent or received . Mrs. Clinton initially said no classified business was transacted , but revised her statement to say none of the information was marked classified at the time she first handled it .
A number of emails have shown , however , that she was aware of the potential for classified information to come across her email . The messages released Thursday by Judicial Watch detail the efforts her team made to try to get a secure BlackBerry device from the National Security Agency .
“ The email shows there ’ s no doubt Mrs. Clinton was involved in the BlackBerry matter , and everything her staff knew , she knew — meaning the BlackBerrys weren ’ t secure , and she shouldn ’ t be using them , ” Mr. Fitton said .","Documents confirm Hillary Clinton was using her secret email server before the March 18 start date she previously claimed, and the State Department had access to some of the messages all along but didn’t notice, a conservative legal watchdog said Thursday.

“It’s another dirty little secret that the State Department hoped nobody would notice,” said Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, who has filed a lawsuit demanding that the department go back and search for more such emails.

Mrs. Clinton had said all of the official record emails from her first two months as secretary, which she was required by law to store and leave in the department archives, are no longer available to her. But the Mills email shows the State Department itself may be sitting on a number of those messages.

The department did not comment on whether it would go back to look for more Clinton emails. Last month, it finished processing some 30,000 messages Mrs. Clinton did return to the government nearly two years after she left office.

Mrs. Clinton’s presidential campaign didn’t respond to a request seeking comment on the discrepancy in her email use.

The State Department has acknowledged gaps in records of Mrs. Clinton’s communications — particularly at the start of her tenure. An official said Thursday that the department is relying on Mrs. Clinton’s own representations about her account use.

“Secretary Clinton and her team have indicated that they provided the department with all work-related emails in her possession from her time at the department,” the official said.

The FBI and the State Department’s inspector general are looking into Mrs. Clinton’s email server and whether classified information was sent or received. Mrs. Clinton initially said no classified business was transacted, but revised her statement to say none of the information was marked classified at the time she first handled it.

A number of emails have shown, however, that she was aware of the potential for classified information to come across her email. The messages released Thursday by Judicial Watch detail the efforts her team made to try to get a secure BlackBerry device from the National Security Agency.

“The email shows there’s no doubt Mrs. Clinton was involved in the BlackBerry matter, and everything her staff knew, she knew — meaning the BlackBerrys weren’t secure, and she shouldn’t be using them,” Mr. Fitton said.

The Trump administration has signalled much broader grounds for future military intervention in Syria , suggesting it might retaliate against the Assad regime for barrel bomb attacks .
On the eve of a critical visit to Moscow at a time of high US-Russian tensions over Syria , the US secretary of state , Rex Tillerson , appeared to go even further , saying his country would come to the defence of innocent civilians “ anywhere in the world ” .
The administration had initially stressed strictly limited objectives for a cruise missile strike last week on a Syrian air force base , saying it was intended to deter the repeat of a chemical attack on Tuesday against civilians and that the focus of US efforts in Syria remains combating the Islamic State ( Isis ) .
'The dead were wherever you looked ' : inside Syrian town after chemical attack Read more
On Monday , however , the White House spokesman , Sean Spicer , widened the criteria for retaliation . “ When you watch babies and children being gassed , and suffer under barrel bombs , you are instantaneously moved to action , ” he said . “ I think this president ’ s made it very clear that if those actions were to continue , further action will definitely be considered by the United States . ”
On Tuesday diplomats gathered in Italy for a second day of G7 talks dominated by the war in Syria , as officials in Washington , the UK and elsewhere floated the possibility of new sanctions on the Syrian and Russian military .
US intelligence believes Assad carried out last week ’ s attack with the chemical agent sarin , killing dozens of civilians including children . But Spicer made the first mention of the use of barrel bombs – crude munitions that can cause indiscriminate casualties .
Pressed on whether chemical warfare as opposed to conventional warfare constitutes a red line , he replied : “ I think the president ’ s been very clear that there were a number of lines crossed last week ... The answer is if you gas a baby , if you put a barrel bomb into innocent people , I think you will see a response from this president . That is unacceptable . ”
The White House said later that Spicer was referring to barrel bombs carrying industrial chemicals like chlorine . But that would still represent a substantial expansion of the US rules of engagement in Syria . The regime is suspected of using chlorine gas in its attacks on dozens of occasions since 2013 .
Tillerson made his remarks during a visit to the site of a 1944 Nazi massacre in Italy , but they clearly referred to the Trump administration ’ s decision on Thursday to launch missile strikes against a Syrian airbase from which the US said a regime chemical attack had been launched against civilians in a rebel-held town .
Tillerson is in Italy for a G7 foreign ministers ’ meeting dominated by discussion of western policy towards Damascus and Moscow . The UK foreign secretary , Boris Johnson , who cancelled his own planned visit to Moscow on Monday , said the ministers would be “ discussing the possibility of further sanctions certainly on some of the Syrian military figures and indeed on some of the Russian military figures who have been involved in coordinating the Syrian military effort ” .
The ministers met again early on Tuesday Morning before Tillerson flies on to Moscow . According to one G7 source , Tillerson plans to offer the Putin regime a bald choice , between cutting Bashar al-Assad loose and being rewarded with a thaw in relations with the west ; or continuing to back him , and risking a Libyan-style outcome . The Libyan leader , Muammar Gaddafi , was violently deposed and killed in 2011 by rebels lent air support by Nato powers , including the UK .
Whitehall sources say Britain has been instrumental in helping to persuade the US to support the idea that Assad – and his family – must be removed from power before progress can be made . Johnson is pushing for the strongest possible conclusion , including the threat of targeted sanctions against Syrian and Russian military commanders – a proposal he judges more likely to win support than wider economic penalties against Moscow .
The decision to approve the missile strike on the Shayrat Syrian air force base marked a sharp change in direction for Donald Trump , who had furiously opposed any such intervention by the Obama administration , and had pledged an “ America first ” foreign policy that would focus on counter-terrorism and narrowly defined US national interests .
Trump emphasised the child victims of the poison gas in justifying the launch of 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles aimed at infrastructure at the Shayrat base , Spicer ’ s comments suggested the president ’ s concern for Syrian children extended to victims of conventional bombing too . Over half a million people have been killed in the six years of the Syrian war . Tillerson ’ s comments suggested that the administration was even open to humanitarian intervention elsewhere .
Speaking to journalists at the site of the 1944 massacre in the Tuscan village of Sant ’ Anna , the secretary of state said : “ We rededicate ourselves to holding to account any and all who commit crimes against the innocents anywhere in the world . ”
The remarks appeared to conflict with Tillerson ’ s own comments on Sunday in which he claimed the administration ’ s priority in Syria had not changed ; it remained the defeat of Isis , and only after that could Syria ’ s political stability be considered . On the same today , the US envoy to the UN , Nikki Haley , said “ getting Assad out ” was one of “ multiple priorities ” held by the administration .
Mike Dubke , Trump ’ s communications director , conceded at a meeting of White House staffers last Tuesday before the missile strike that the president lacked a coherent foreign policy and said that “ there is no Trump doctrine ” , according to an account of the meeting by Politico .
“ It ’ s head-spinning , ” said Philip Gordon , a special assistant to the president on the Middle East in the Obama administration . “ They went from vehement opposition to any kind of military intervention to executing those strikes and saying that ’ s what we would be doing any time chemical weapons are used .
“ This is on a whole new level , if Tillerson is really saying we would defend the innocent anywhere in the world , ” Gordon added . “ If that ’ s the new standard , we are going to be doing a lot of intervening . ”
Russia has denied the Syrian regime carried out the Khan Sheikhun chemical attack , which killed more than 80 people ( including in strikes on hospitals after the attacks ) , and has denounced the US missile strike as illegal . Tillerson is due to meet his Russian counterpart , Sergei Lavrov , in Moscow . A Kremlin spokesman said there were no plans in Putin ’ s diary “ right now ” for a meeting , but US officials are expecting Putin to meet Tillerson on Wednesday . The two men had cordial relations when the Texan was in his previous job as head of the ExxonMobil oil company .
Another issue that hangs over Tillerson ’ s trip to Moscow is the question of Russia ’ s complicity in the chemical attack . Russian troops are stationed at their own compound at the Sharyat base and were there at the time Washington alleges Syrian aircraft took off on Tuesday for the attack on Khan Sheikhun .
The Associated Press quoted a senior US official as saying the US had concluded that Russia had prior knowledge of the Tuesday chemical attack on Khan Sheikhun . The official said a drone operated by Russians was flying over a hospital as victims of the attack were rushing to get treatment . Hours after the drone left , a Russian-made fighter jet bombed the hospital in what American officials believe was an attempt to cover up the usage of chemical weapons , the AP reported .
Charles Lister , a Syria expert at the Middle East Institute , said : “ I ’ m told the US knows of Russia ’ s involvement in the CW [ chemical weapons ] attack and hopes to use this as back-scenes leverage . ”
But on Monday evening , at a snap off-the-record briefing at the White House , a senior administration official rejected the claim , insisting that no such consensus about Russia ’ s foreknowledge exists in the intelligence community .
A joint command centre made up of the forces of Russia , Iran and militias supporting the Syrian regime warned the US missile strike had crossed “ red lines ” and it would respond to any new aggression and increase its support for its ally .
“ What America waged in an aggression on Syria is a crossing of red lines . From now on we will respond with force to any aggressor or any breach of red lines from whoever it is , and America knows our ability to respond well , ” the centre said in a statement published by the group on the media outlet Ilam al Harbi ( War Media ) .
The supreme leader of Iran , which provides substantial ground support to the Assad regime , has also warned the US that its intervention would prove to be a mistake for Trump .

Really.,2017-04-10,,"Secretary of State Rex Tillerson ’ s visit to Moscow this week was going to be awkward even before the U.S. attack on Syria , given multiple investigations into the Trump team ’ s connections to Russia and Tillerson ’ s status as a novice diplomat . His trip , the first by a senior Trump administration official to Russia , will test his skills and also serve as a reality test for President Trump ’ s dream of improving U.S.-Russian relations .
The missile strikes on a Syrian airbase last week complicate this dream , but it would be wrong to interpret them as a reversal in Trump ’ s Russia policy . They are best understood as a warning against the use of chemical weapons and a signal that Trump won ’ t be shy about using force .
In Moscow , Tillerson is currently scheduled to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov . It would n't be surprising if he also sees President Vladimir Putin , who awarded him the country ’ s Order of Friendship for his work with Russia as chief executive of ExxonMobil .
Their words will mean far less than Russia ’ s actions . Tillerson will have the chance to advance U.S. interests in key areas such as Ukraine and Syria if he keeps that in mind and utilizes tactics he developed in business . To be effective , a chief executive must grasp the fundamental facts surrounding any strategic decision . It is a fundamental fact that Putin is overseeing a focused campaign to undermine U.S. interests globally and subvert our democracy domestically .
Putin ’ s indiscriminate bombing of civilians in Syria has not only caused a humanitarian catastrophe , it has also flooded Europe with refugees and radicalized untold numbers of Middle Eastern youths . His invasion of Ukraine has rattled the very core of the European state system . And whether or not Putin helped Trump win last year , it is indisputable that Russia ’ s interference has polarized our politics , sowed division and distrust , and discredited some of our most essential institutions .
The central theme of U.S. policy on Russia has long been “ cooperate where we can but confront where we must. ” Tillerson must go beyond this tired cliché . Just as a chief executive might strike a performance-based deal with a new contractor , he should require Moscow to meet measurable benchmarks before unlocking further layers of cooperation . Instead of “ trust but verify , ” he should be guided by “ don ’ t trust — verify , then verify again . ”
A path forward that is limited in scope and measurable in results offers the best chance at success . That ’ s why Tillerson should concentrate on a small set of issues , starting with Ukraine and Syria , and outline concrete steps as testing points for the future of U.S.-Russian relations . He must not acquiesce to what Putin wants : broad and symbolic cooperation that allows Moscow a free hand in those two hot spots .
A good chief executive understands the strengths and weaknesses of his competitors . Similarly , Tillerson must bear in mind that while Russia has its strong points , it is not 10-feet-tall . Putin may be a shrewd tactician , but his economy — constrained by sanctions , low oil prices , and rampant brain drain — remains feeble . Russia is not China ; it does not have billions of trade and investment dollars to throw around in hopes of courting influence .
When you cut through the paranoia , Russia is a formidable military power , with a fearsome nuclear arsenal and advanced cyber capabilities , but it is not a near-peer competitor like China . Perhaps Putin ’ s biggest advantage today is that he knows what he wants . As the Trump administration struggles to manage the day-to-day functions of the U.S. government , it has shown little capacity to pursue a strategically ambitious foreign policy . Meanwhile , Moscow is intensely focused on eroding U.S. influence and democracy around the globe .
Tillerson must also appreciate that Russia respects only strength . He was wise to draw a bright line on sanctions in Brussels . An early lifting of sanctions would have projected weakness and invited further Russian aggression and malfeasance . On this visit he should reiterate America ’ s commitment to hold firm on sanctions until Russia pulls back from Ukrainian territory , and seek to re-energize the diplomatic process . The White House could strengthen his hand by indicating it backs a stronger U.S. military presence in Europe and additional sanctions if Russia continues to disregard its neighbors ’ sovereignty .
On Syria , Tillerson must directly confront the Kremlin on its support for Syrian President Bashar Assad . He should use the missile strikes to persuade Moscow to back a political transition that removes Assad , and to agree to redirect Russian military assets in Syria to target the Islamic State of Syria and Iraq instead of shoring up Assad . Trump may be tempted by a “ grand bargain ” that makes a flashy headline , but Tillerson should protect his boss from any deal that gives Moscow good publicity before it changes its behavior in practice .
Many U.S. presidents have entered office seeking a better relationship with Russia ; nearly as many have left with such hopes dashed . As Tillerson prepares to kick off the new administration ’ s diplomacy with Russia , he must draw on his experience as a CEO and keep American interests front and center . While it would indeed be nice if we “ got along with Russia , ” as Trump puts it , the key question remains : At what price ?

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s visit to Moscow this week was going to be awkward even before the U.S. attack on Syria, given multiple investigations into the Trump team’s connections to Russia and Tillerson’s status as a novice diplomat.

To be effective, a chief executive must grasp the fundamental facts surrounding any strategic decision. It is a fundamental fact that Putin is overseeing a focused campaign to undermine U.S. interests globally and subvert our democracy domestically.

Putin’s indiscriminate bombing of civilians in Syria has not only caused a humanitarian catastrophe, it has also flooded Europe with refugees and radicalized untold numbers of Middle Eastern youths. His invasion of Ukraine has rattled the very core of the European state system. And whether or not Putin helped Trump win last year, it is indisputable that Russia’s interference has polarized our politics, sowed division and distrust, and discredited some of our most essential institutions.

Syria missile strike could lead to political solution: Column

Beware the Syria snakepit: Christian Schneider

The central theme of U.S. policy on Russia has long been “cooperate where we can but confront where we must.” Tillerson must go beyond this tired cliché. Just as a chief executive might strike a performance-based deal with a new contractor, he should require Moscow to meet measurable benchmarks before unlocking further layers of cooperation. Instead of “trust but verify,” he should be guided by “don’t trust — verify, then verify again.”

A path forward that is limited in scope and measurable in results offers the best chance at success. That’s why Tillerson should concentrate on a small set of issues, starting with Ukraine and Syria, and outline concrete steps as testing points for the future of U.S.-Russian relations. He must not acquiesce to what Putin wants: broad and symbolic cooperation that allows Moscow a free hand in those two hot spots.

A good chief executive understands the strengths and weaknesses of his competitors. Similarly, Tillerson must bear in mind that while Russia has its strong points, it is not 10-feet-tall. Putin may be a shrewd tactician, but his economy — constrained by sanctions, low oil prices, and rampant brain drain — remains feeble. Russia is not China; it does not have billions of trade and investment dollars to throw around in hopes of courting influence.

When you cut through the paranoia, Russia is a formidable military power, with a fearsome nuclear arsenal and advanced cyber capabilities, but it is not a near-peer competitor like China. Perhaps Putin’s biggest advantage today is that he knows what he wants. As the Trump administration struggles to manage the day-to-day functions of the U.S. government, it has shown little capacity to pursue a strategically ambitious foreign policy. Meanwhile, Moscow is intensely focused on eroding U.S. influence and democracy around the globe.

POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media

Trump pulls the trigger in Syria: Our view

Tillerson must also appreciate that Russia respects only strength. He was wise to draw a bright line on sanctions in Brussels. An early lifting of sanctions would have projected weakness and invited further Russian aggression and malfeasance. On this visit he should reiterate America’s commitment to hold firm on sanctions until Russia pulls back from Ukrainian territory, and seek to re-energize the diplomatic process. The White House could strengthen his hand by indicating it backs a stronger U.S. military presence in Europe and additional sanctions if Russia continues to disregard its neighbors’ sovereignty.

On Syria, Tillerson must directly confront the Kremlin on its support for Syrian President Bashar Assad. He should use the missile strikes to persuade Moscow to back a political transition that removes Assad, and to agree to redirect Russian military assets in Syria to target the Islamic State of Syria and Iraq instead of shoring up Assad. Trump may be tempted by a “grand bargain” that makes a flashy headline, but Tillerson should protect his boss from any deal that gives Moscow good publicity before it changes its behavior in practice.

Many U.S. presidents have entered office seeking a better relationship with Russia; nearly as many have left with such hopes dashed. As Tillerson prepares to kick off the new administration’s diplomacy with Russia, he must draw on his experience as a CEO and keep American interests front and center. While it would indeed be nice if we “got along with Russia,” as Trump puts it, the key question remains: At what price?

The State Department 's top spokesman offered his public thanks to Fox News reporter James Rosen for alerting the agency to a video from a 2013 briefing that had been edited to delete his question about Iran .
`` We took this seriously , '' John Kirby said at the start of an interview on the network 's `` Fox & Friends '' on Thursday , after the department acknowledged Wednesday that part of a video of Rosen asking a question was purposely deleted rather than being a `` glitch '' as it previously stated . `` And actually before I answer your question , I want to thank James Rosen , your correspondent , for bringing this to my attention because if he had n't a couple of weeks ago , I would have never known this occurred . So first of all , kudos to him . ''
Kirby continued , calling Rosen `` a journalist I have great respect for , so I thank him for that . ''
Once presented with the facts of the deleted video excerpt , which featured Rosen asking then-State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki about the Iran negotiations on Dec. 2 , 2013 , Kirby said the department `` took it seriously '' and looked into the matter . `` Another thing , I did n't say yesterday that everything was over . I said that we looked at this , '' Kirby said , emphasizing that if more details come to light , those would factor into any further investigation .
Psaki , now White House communications director , tweeted Wednesday that she `` had no knowledge of , nor would I have approved of , any form of editing or cutting my briefing transcript on any subject while @ StateDept ''
Kirby also flatly rejected the notion that there is a `` cover-up '' at Foggy Bottom .
Richard Grenell , a former U.S. spokesman to the United Nations and current Fox contributor , appeared earlier on the same program and suggested that there is `` a cover-up going on right now , '' which Kirby strongly contested .
`` No , there 's no cover-up . Not at all , '' Kirby responded . `` And I think you guys know me well enough to know that I would never abide by any such thing . As I said , we interviewed this individual . We tried to find out what happened . Where I am now is where I was yesterday . We just do n't know who made the request and why . But if additional information were to come to life that would change our finding , I would look at it deeper . ''
The spokesman also noted that the edited video was only on State 's YouTube channel , remarking that a full , unedited version was always available `` on another official website , the defense video information website as well as the transcript — the written transcript was never edited . ''
“ So the only one that was — I 'm not mitigating or making excuses , but the one that was edited was the one that went on that YouTube channel , '' he said .
Asked whether more videos could have been similarly edited during Psaki 's tenure , Kirby replied , `` The short answer to your question is , I do n't know . ''
`` And I do n't know that there 's any way I can know . I just do n't have the time or the resources or the manpower to go back and look at every single press briefing over the last three or four years , '' he said . `` And I do n't know that 's a useful use of taxpayer dollars .

The official said the accounts include not only Clinton ’ s but those of top aides – including Cheryl Mills , Huma Abedin , Jake Sullivan and Philippe Reines – as well as State Department Under Secretary for Management Patrick F. Kennedy and others . There is no public evidence they were authorized to receive the intelligence some of which was beyond Top Secret .
A second source not authorized to speak on the record said the number of accounts involved could be as high as 30 and reflects how the intelligence was broadly shared , replied to , and copied to individuals using the unsecured server .
“ My contacts with former colleagues and current active duty personnel involved in sensitive programs reveal a universal feeling that the HRC issue is more serious than the general public realizes , ” Dan Maguire , a former strategic planner with Africom , and with 46 years combined service , told Fox . “ Most opine they would already be behind bars if they had apparently compromised sensitive information as reported . ”
Without access to the actual e-mails , Maguire said it was hard to ascertain what damage might have been done by the disclosure of human spying intelligence and secret material .
“ Either way , the intelligence community is undoubtedly conducting damage assessments and evaluating the viability of any ongoing operation that may have been exposed to unauthorized personnel . The vulnerability of HRC ’ s server to foreign government hacking can not be overlooked - even the DCI , John Brennan , has been the target of hackers , ” he said .
Former U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey told Fox , “ It is counterintuitive to suggest that they ( Clinton ’ s aides ) all had authorization and access through a non-secure server to information of that sensitivity . ”
The State Department recently confirmed that the messages in question include the most sensitive kind of intelligence . On Jan. 29 , Fox News first reported that some emails on Clinton ’ s server were too damaging to release in any form . The State Department subsequently announced that 22 “ top secret ” emails were being withheld in full ; these were the messages being handled by more than a dozen accounts .
Pressed on whether a damage assessment was being done , State Department Spokesman Mark Toner said , “ To your broader question – what is being done to -- as you said spillage – I can ’ t speak to those efforts today .

The official said the accounts include not only Clinton’s but those of top aides – including Cheryl Mills, Huma Abedin, Jake Sullivan and Philippe Reines – as well as State Department Under Secretary for Management Patrick F. Kennedy and others. There is no public evidence they were authorized to receive the intelligence some of which was beyond Top Secret.

A second source not authorized to speak on the record said the number of accounts involved could be as high as 30 and reflects how the intelligence was broadly shared, replied to, and copied to individuals using the unsecured server.

“My contacts with former colleagues and current active duty personnel involved in sensitive programs reveal a universal feeling that the HRC issue is more serious than the general public realizes,” Dan Maguire, a former strategic planner with Africom, and with 46 years combined service, told Fox. “Most opine they would already be behind bars if they had apparently compromised sensitive information as reported.”

Without access to the actual e-mails, Maguire said it was hard to ascertain what damage might have been done by the disclosure of human spying intelligence and secret material.

“Either way, the intelligence community is undoubtedly conducting damage assessments and evaluating the viability of any ongoing operation that may have been exposed to unauthorized personnel. The vulnerability of HRC’s server to foreign government hacking cannot be overlooked - even the DCI, John Brennan, has been the target of hackers,” he said.

Former U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey told Fox, “It is counterintuitive to suggest that they (Clinton’s aides) all had authorization and access through a non-secure server to information of that sensitivity.”

The State Department recently confirmed that the messages in question include the most sensitive kind of intelligence. On Jan. 29, Fox News first reported that some emails on Clinton’s server were too damaging to release in any form. The State Department subsequently announced that 22 “top secret” emails were being withheld in full; these were the messages being handled by more than a dozen accounts.

Pressed on whether a damage assessment was being done, State Department Spokesman Mark Toner said, “To your broader question – what is being done to -- as you said spillage – I can’t speak to those efforts today. We’re aware obviously of those concerns. We are taking steps, but I don’t have any more details to provide.”

Aside from this week’s letter confirming the FBI investigation is focused on Clinton’s server, the Bureau has not publicly acknowledged whom it has contracted or interviewed.

Kennedy recently told the House Benghazi Select Committee that he knew about Clinton's personal email from the beginning, but did not understand the ""scope"" of its use for Clinton’s government business.

Kennedy's testimony now appears to conflict with emails released through the Freedom of Information Act that show he routinely sent and received government business from the Clintonemail.com account.

Toner said Kennedy learned about Clinton’s arrangement later. “He did not have knowledge of the computer server that she had set up [for] personal email or computer server she'd set up at her residence,” he said.

However, on the official State Department website, Patrick F. Kennedy’s biography says that he has worked for the department since 1993 and, in his current position as Under Secretary for Management, he is responsible for the “people, resources, budget, facilities, technology, financial operations, consular affairs, logistics, contracting, and security for Department of State operations.”",www.foxnews.com,right,PrHKagBD8mk6rdgY

The reports included a 16-page list of weapons that Libyans supposedly tracked to the rebels from Western sources or their allies in the region . The memos were corroborated by a U.S. intelligence asset familiar with the documents as well as former top Gadhafi regime official Mohammed Ismael .
“ NATO has given permission to a number of weapons-loaded aircraft to land at Benghazi airport and some Tunisian airports , ” the intelligence report said , identifying masses of weapons including tanks and surface-to-air missiles .
That report , which was prepared in English so it could be passed by a U.S. intelligence asset to key members of Congress , identified specific air and sea shipments observed by Libyan intelligence moving weapons to the rebels trying to unseat the Gadhafi regime .
“ There is a close link between al Qaeda , Jihadi organizations , and the opposition in Libya , ” the report warned .
SEE ALSO : Exclusive : Secret tapes undermine Hillary Clinton on Libyan war
In the documents and separately recorded conversations with U.S. emissaries , Libyan officials expressed particular concern that the weapons and training given the rebels would spread throughout the region , in particular turning the city of Benghazi into a future terrorist haven .
Those fears would be realized a little over a year later when a band of jihadist insurgents attacked the State Department diplomatic post in Benghazi and a related CIA compound , killing four Americans including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens . Today , more than three years after Gadhafi fell from power and was killed , Benghazi and much of the rest of Libya remain in chaos , riddled with violence among rival tribes and thriving jihadi groups .
Mrs. Clinton , now considering a run for president , was the moving force inside the Obama administration to encourage U.S. military intervention to unseat Gadhafi in Libya . The latest documents and audio recordings are likely to give her Republican critics on Capitol Hill fresh ammunition to question whether she had an adequate plan and whether her efforts led to the tragedy in Benghazi a year later and the general lawlessness and chaos that have gripped Libya since .
The Times reported last week that U.S. intelligence did not support the story that Mrs. Clinton used to sell the war in Libya , mainly that there was an imminent danger of a genocide to be carried out by the Gadhafi regime . The intelligence community , in fact , had come to the opposite conclusion : that Gadhafi would not risk world outrage by killing civilians en masse even as he tried to crush the rebellion in his country .
The Times also reported that the Pentagon and a key Democrat so distrusted Mrs. Clinton ’ s decision-making on Libya that they opened their own secret diplomatic conversations with the Gadhafi regime , going around the State Department .
In one conversation recorded in summer 2011 between Libyan officials and an intelligence asset dispatched by the Pentagon as a back-door channel , the asset told Mr. Ismael , who served then as Gadhafi ’ s chief of staff , that U.S. officials were considering taking some of the Libyan dictator ’ s frozen money assets and sending it to the rebels .
“ I ’ m in contact with some of the people over in Benghazi and they ’ ve told me point blank that their first use of this money is , is to buy military training , weapons and mercenaries , ” the Pentagon intelligence asset told Mr. Ismael on July 24 , 2011 .
In a separate conversation with Dennis J. Kucinich , an Ohio Democrat serving in the House , Gadhafi ’ s eldest son , Seif , told the congressman that Libyan intelligence had observed Qatar , a major U.S. ally in the region , facilitating weapons shipments . Qatar has steadfastly and repeatedly denied arming the rebels .
“ The Qataris have spent more than $ 100 million on this , and they have an agreement with the rebels that the moment you rule Libya you pay us back , ” Seif Gadhafi told Mr. Kucinich in a conversation recorded in May 2011 .
“ So , it ’ s your position that your government has been trying to defend itself against an insurrection brought about by jihadists who were joined by gangsters , terrorists and that there ’ s basically about 1,000 people who were joined by NATO ? ” Mr. Kucinich asked .
“ You ’ re saying that this relates to internal matters , matters internal to the region relating of a power struggle in which they then turned their attention to Libya to try to engulf Libya in their own desire for increasing their power ? ” Mr. Kucinich asked .
“ For the Qataris , they are doing this with every country , with every country , ” Mr. Gadhafi said . “ This is their plan , I mean in public . This is their own agenda . I mean , it ’ s not something hidden , or something , you know , private . But now , we have , and plus the French and British have also have their own agenda , you know , commercial interests , political interests , they have their own interests . They told us , especially the French , and the Qataris and the British : We want those people to share the power with you , our own people , the heads of rebels . ”
The recorded conversations also included concerns that the U.S. might try to arm the rebels despite a U.N. arms embargo on Libya .
On March 27 , 2011 , days after the intervention began , Mrs. Clinton argued that the arms embargo could be disregarded if shipping weapons to rebels would help protect civilians , but defense officials in the United Kingdom disagreed with her interpretation of international law .
“ We ’ re not arming the rebels . We ’ re not planning to arm the rebels , ” British Defense Secretary Liam Fox told the BBC the day Mrs. Clinton hinted otherwise .
Likewise , Qatari officials sent a letter Feb. 2 , 2012 , to the United Nations about the Libyan uprising , “ categorically ” denying that they had “ supplied the revolutionaries with arms and ammunitions ” as some had reported .
Attempts to contact the Qatari Embassy in Washington for comment Sunday were unsuccessful , but the classified Libyan intelligence report indicates that Qatar sent tanks , missiles , trucks and military advisers to the rebels .
Distrust between Libya and Qatar had simmered for years before the civil war in Libya erupted . Mr. Ismael told The Times in an interview that the Qataris had a grudge against the Gadhafi regime because it did not give them natural gas and oil concessions that were promised in 2007 .
The Libyan intelligence reports provided to the Pentagon ’ s emissary detailed specific weapons shipments they said came from Qatar .
“ On 15th of March the ship loaded with arm [ s ] arrived to the seaport of Tobruk . On 4th April 2011 two Qatari aircraft laden with a number of tanks , [ ground-attack ] missiles and heavy trucks was arranged . On 11th April 2011 a number of boats departed Benghazi for Misrata , the shipment comprised assistance including SAM-7 [ anti-aircraft ] missiles . On 22nd April 2011 , 800 rifles were sent from Benghazi to Misrata , ” the report said .
Whether such shipments were supposed to stay with NATO or go to the rebels remains in dispute . But academic analysts say the Libyan concerns that arming the rebels would benefit terrorists were shared widely .
NATO allies knew of the dangerous jihadi elements operating in Benghazi before the 2011 intervention began , according to Noman Benotman , president of the British-based Quilliam Foundation , a think tank dedicated to combating Islamic extremism .
Mr. Benotman also was a leader of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group but left the organization prior to the 2011 revolution .
“ A lot of jihadists that had been locked up by the regime were released after the revolution started . They picked up many of the guns that were coming into the country and fought , but they were not fighting for democracy — they were fighting their own revolution , trying to build a state based on a vicious , violent , radical , Islamic ideology . They took advantage of the situation , ” he said .
“ There were pro-democracy demonstrators participating in the revolution , of course , but there was also crystal-clear evidence of jihadists and jihadist tactics in Benghazi before the NATO intervention started , so no one can say there were no jihadists there , ” he said .","Last of three parts

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was fired via Twitter after returning from an Africa trip during which he was out of the loop on North Korean talks and contradicted the White House position on Russia's responsibility for poisoning a former double agent in the United Kingdom.

In other words, his last week on the job was like many others in his 405-day tenure as the nation's top diplomat — the shortest of any secretary of State to begin an administration since Elihu B. Washburne's 11-day service in 1869.

Tillerson often found himself on the outer ring of President Trump's inner circle, trying to interpret the president's mercurial and contradictory foreign policy to the rest of the world.

He reassured NATO allies that the United States remained committed to the alliance after the president threatened to pull out over ""dues"" that Trump said were owed directly to the United States. (They weren't.)

He engaged with North Korea despite the president's protests — again via Twitter — that he was ""wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man.”

And he tried to salvage the Iran nuclear deal through a European-brokered fix to the Obama-era agreement rather than having Trump scuttle the deal completely.

In explaining his break with Tillerson on Tuesday, Trump specifically cited those differences over the Iran deal: ""I think it's terrible. I guess he feels it was OK.""

But Trump's comments give a glimpse into why he's making this move now.

Trump is heading into an unprecedented face-to-face meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un over that country's nuclear program. The timing of Tillerson's dismissal was designed to allow Trump to put a new team in place before those talks, a White House official said on condition of anonymity to discuss a personnel decision.

Trump's nominee to replace Tillerson is CIA Director Mike Pompeo, whose hard-line stances on Iran and North Korea are closer to Trump's.

Trump conceded Tuesday that he and Tillerson often were not on the same page. ""I actually got along well with Rex, but really, it was a different mind-set. It was a different thinking.

""With Mike Pompeo,"" he said, ""we have a similar thought process.""

North Korea hawks applauded Pompeo's nomination. ""No one understands the threat posed by North Korea and Iran better than he does,"" said Sen. Lindsay Graham, R-S.C.

But Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., said he feared Trump was stocking his Cabinet with yes men. ""It is disturbing to see such a high-level change in our diplomatic team as negotiations with North Korea move into a new and delicate stage,"" he said.

While Tillerson was in Africa last week, it was Pompeo who explained Trump's unexpected rapprochement with North Korea on CBS' Face the Nation Sunday.

Pompeo would not be pinned down on whether he or the secretary of State would lead the preliminary talks before the Trump-Kim summit. His appointment to Tillerson's post would resolve that conflict and put him unambiguously in charge of getting Trump and Kim to the table.

The White House announced the personnel moves through an increasingly common playbook: a leak, a tweet and written statements from those involved. In this case: Trump, Pompeo and CIA nominee Gina Haspel.

Conspicuously missing: a statement from Tillerson himself.

Tillerson's side of the story came from Steve Goldstein, undersecretary of State for public diplomacy.



""The secretary had every intention of staying because of critical progress made in national security,"" he said. ""The secretary did not speak to the president and is unaware of the reason.""

Goldstein was then fired for contradicting the White House's account of Tillerson's dismissal.

Later, Tillerson appeared in a State Department auditorium to give a statement to reporters. He talked about the hard work it took to get North Korea to the table: ending President Obama's policy of ""strategic patience"" and replacing it with a maximum-pressure campaign to rally the world to impose punishing sanctions on the North Korean regime.

Among the new names floated in press leaks on Monday were Jon Huntsman , former Utah governor and ambassador to China , Rex Tillerson , the chief executive officer of the Exxon Mobil oil company and Nato ’ s former commander in Europe , and the retired admiral James Stavridis .
The expanded search will come as a disappointment to the four men who were on the shortlist last week : the former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani , the former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney , the retired general David Petraeus and the Republican senator Bob Corker .

Juli Hanscom , a spokeswoman for the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University , where Stavridis is the dean , confirmed that he would be going to New York to talk to the president-elect on Thursday but added : “ There has been no discussion of a position in the Trump administration . ”
Stavridis , a registered independent , was vetted by the Hillary Clinton campaign in July as a possible running mate . The former supreme allied commander in Europe ( Saceur ) derided Trump ’ s foreign policy , after the candidate gave an interview to the New York Times suggesting US protection for Nato allies could depend on if “ they had met their obligations to us ” .
“ I can picture the scene : national security advisor Tiffany Trump walks into the Oval Office with a load of charts on trade policy , basing agreements , cost-sharing , and balance of payments – all while Russian troops are pouring into Estonia , ” Stavridis wrote in Foreign Policy .
“ Unfortunately , his reckless proposals would deeply damage the underpinnings of the global system and work to America ’ s profound disadvantage . ”
Huntsman wavered in his loyalties over the course of the campaign , publicly withdrawing support from Trump after a video surfaced in October in which he boasted about sexually assaulting women . Huntsman urged Trump to drop out of the race and let his running mate compete for the presidency instead .
“ I ’ m around to serve my country . I ’ ve always believed in that , and any way I can help I can always stand up , salute and do what I can , ” Huntsman told NBC News on Monday . He defended Trump ’ s controversial decision to hold a phone conversation with the Taiwan president , Tsai Ing-wen , which broke a 37-year diplomatic norm and upset Beijing .
“ It provides space and leverage in the overall US-China relationship . It ’ s been tried and talked before , but what is different this time is you ’ ve got a businessman who has become president of the United States , who understands real leverage and how to find real leverage in that relationship , ” he said .
Huntsman , who speaks Mandarin Chinese , was appointed ambassador to China by Barack Obama in 2009 and served there until 2011 when he resigned and returned to the US to stage a presidential campaign .
Forbes magazine noted that if Huntsman were nominated as secretary of state , he would be the third scion of a billionaire family to be picked for Trump ’ s cabinet . The 56-year-old Utah politician ’ s father founded Huntsman Corp , a Texas-based chemical company . Like Romney , Huntsman comes from an established and wealthy Mormon family .
Tillerson , the Exxon executive , is due to meet Trump on Tuesday . He is a prominent conservative businessman who has generally funded Republican campaigns , but did not contribute to the Trump presidential bid .
Also mentioned in press leaks as being under consideration for the secretary of state job are the Californian Republican congressman Dana Rohrabacher , an outspoken supporter of Vladimir Putin ( who recalled over the weekend a drunken arm-wrestling match in the early 1990s with the future Russian leader ) and a Democratic senator from West Virginia , Joe Manchin , who backed Clinton in the campaign . Manchin met the president-elect last week , and was touted earlier as a possible energy secretary .
Also on the newly extended list is John Bolton , an ultra-conservative former ambassador to the UN , who was thought to have dropped out of contention , but who visited Trump in New York on Friday and is said to be still under consideration .
“ It ’ s true he ’ s broadened the search , ” Trump ’ s aide , Kellyanne Conway , said on Sunday . “ He ’ s very fortunate to have interest among serious men and women , all of whom need to understand that their first and foremost responsibility as secretary of state would be to implement and adhere to the president-elect ’ s America first foreign policy and be loyal to his view of the world . ”

state_department,CNN (Web News),0,http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/09/politics/hillary-clinton-emails-judicial-watch/,Newly released Clinton emails shed light on relationship between State Dept. and Clinton Foundation,2016-08-09,"Daniella Diaz, Pamela Brown, Elise Labott","Washington ( CNN ) Newly released emails from Hillary Clinton 's tenure as secretary of state raise questions about the nature of the department 's relationship with the Clinton Foundation .
Judicial Watch , a conservative watchdog group , released 296 pages of emails from the Democratic presidential nominee , including 44 that Judicial Watch says were not previously handed over to the State Department by Clinton . The emails , many of which are heavily redacted , raise questions about the Clinton Foundation 's influence on the State Department and its relations during her tenure .
In one instance , top Clinton Foundation official Doug Band lobbied Clinton aides for a job for someone else in the State Department . In the email , Band tells Hillary Clinton 's former aides at the department -- Cheryl Mills and Huma Abedin -- that it is `` important to take care of ( redacted ) . '' Band is reassured by Abedin that `` Personnel has been sending him options . ''
The emails were obtained by the group through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by Judicial Watch against the State Department in 2015 . The group did not respond to a CNN request for comment .
The Trump campaign seized at the new batch of emails , citing them as evidence of Clinton being corrupt . The prolonged investigations into her use of a private email server while at the State Department has fueled public distrust of her and plagued her presidential bid . But the Justice Department declined to press charges against Clinton for her handling of classified information related to the server earlier this year , with FBI Director James Comey saying while she was `` extremely careless , '' it was his judgment that `` no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case . ''
In a 2009 email , Band directs Abedin and Mills to put Gilbert Chagoury , a Lebanese-Nigerian billionaire and Clinton Foundation donor , in contact with the State Department 's `` substance person '' on Lebanon .
`` We need Gilbert Chagoury to speak to the substance person re Lebanon , '' Band wrote . `` As you know , he 's a key guy there and to us and is loved in Lebanon . Very imp . ''
`` It 's jeff feltman , '' Abedin responded , referring to Jeffrey Feltman , who was the US ambassador to Lebanon at the time . `` I 'm sure he knows him . I 'll talk to jeff . ''
Feltman told CNN Wednesday that he never met with Chagoury .
`` I have never met nor spoken with Mr Chagoury . I was not aware of the proposal that he speak to me until this email exchange was released , but in any case we never spoke , '' he said .
Judicial Watch President Tom Filton said in a press release that Clinton `` hid '' the 44 emails on purpose .
`` No wonder Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin hid emails from the American people , the courts and Congress , '' he said in a press release . `` They show the Clinton Foundation , Clinton donors , and operatives worked with Hillary Clinton in potential violation of the law . ''
Clinton 's campaign said the emails did n't relate to her work at the Clinton Foundation .
`` Neither of these emails involve the secretary or relate to the Foundation 's work , '' said an emailed statement from Clinton campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin . `` They are communications between her aides and the President 's personal aide , and indeed the recommendation was for one of the Secretary 's former staffers who was not employed by the Foundation . ''
The Clinton campaign said Wednesday that Chagoury only wanted to offer insights on the then-upcoming Lebanese election and was not looking for any specific action from the State Department .
`` The right-wing organization behind this lawsuit has been attacking the Clintons since the 1990s and no matter how this group tries to mischaracterize these documents , the fact remains that Hillary Clinton never took action as secretary of state because of donations to the Clinton Foundation , '' Schwerin said in a statement .
GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump sought to use the emails to paint Clinton as corrupt .
`` This is yet more evidence that Hillary Clinton lacks the judgment , character , stability and temperament to be within 1,000 miles of public power , '' said Stephen Miller , Trump 's national policy director . `` She views public office as nothing more than a means to personal enrichment -- and every dollar she takes comes at the expense of the public welfare . This latest finding is an unseemly , disturbing window into a corrupt office , and yet more evidence that Hillary Clinton has been lying from the beginning -- and by any reasonable definition attempted to obstruct the investigation of the FBI . ''
Trump also tweeted : `` When is the media going to talk about Hillary 's policies that have gotten people killed , like Libya , open borders , and maybe her emails ? ''
When is the media going to talk about Hillary 's policies that have gotten people killed , like Libya , open borders , and maybe her emails ? — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) August 10 , 2016
Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said Wednesday that if the State Department does n't release all of the remaining Clinton emails by November it will prove the system is `` rigged '' -- a line Trump has used recently .
`` Anything less than a full release of these public records before voting begins will only further prove that we have a rigged system that has one set of rules political elites and another for everyone else , '' Priebus said in a statement .
On Wednesday , Judicial Watch released written testimony from Mills , in which she provides further detail on how Clinton 's private email server was set up to address potentially security concerns . Mills told the attorneys she spoke with a Clinton IT staffer in 2013 , after learning the email account of a close Clinton confidante , Sidney Blumenthal , had been compromised by a hacker .
`` As I recall , these discussions involved whether this event might affect Secretary Clinton 's email , '' Mills said in follow-up answers to an earlier deposition given to Judicial Watch .
Mills also said she recalls speaking to the same staffer -- Bryan Pagliano -- about the company overseeing the server set up .
`` As I recall , these discussions involved whether Platte River Networks would have the technical capacity and be the appropriate source from which to gather Secretary Clinton 's email from the clintonemail.com system , '' Mills said .
Early this year as the investigation into Clinton 's private email server was in full swing , several FBI field offices approached the Justice Department asking to open a case regarding the relationship between the State Department and the Clinton Foundation , according to a law enforcement official . At the time , DOJ declined because it had looked into allegations surrounding the Clinton Foundation around a year earlier and found there was n't sufficient evidence to open a case .
In a hearing last month on Capitol Hill , FBI Director James Comey declined to say whether the Clinton Foundation was under investigation , saying : `` I 'm not going to comment on the existence or non-existence of any investigation . ''
For there to be criminal conflict of interest there would have to be evidence showing a government employee received something of value in exchange , such as a job post-employment or money . There does n't appear to be anything so far suggesting that in the newly released , heavily redacted emails from Judicial Watch . But those emails do raise questions about whether the relationship between the State Department and Clinton Foundation was too cozy , particularly after Clinton pledged she would not be involved with the foundation when she became secretary of state , in an effort to prevent an inappropriate relationship .
In a case where there 's a possible conflict of interest that 's not necessarily criminal , the inspector general can look into it and take an administrative remedy if necessary . The State Department OIG has been looking into connections between the State Department and Clinton during her term as secretary of state since earlier this year , but has not said anything about the matter .
The Clinton Foundation has repeatedly said it is not being investigated .
On Tuesday , the Clinton campaign said there is nothing to suggest foul play , and Clinton had nothing to do with the newly released emails . The campaign has said in the past the Clintons do n't take a salary from the foundation and all their income is disclosed .","Washington (CNN) Newly released emails from Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state raise questions about the nature of the department's relationship with the Clinton Foundation.

But the Justice Department declined to press charges against Clinton for her handling of classified information related to the server earlier this year, with FBI Director James Comey saying while she was ""extremely careless,"" it was his judgment that ""no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.""

In a 2009 email, Band directs Abedin and Mills to put Gilbert Chagoury, a Lebanese-Nigerian billionaire and Clinton Foundation donor, in contact with the State Department's ""substance person"" on Lebanon.

""We need Gilbert Chagoury to speak to the substance person re Lebanon,"" Band wrote . ""As you know, he's a key guy there and to us and is loved in Lebanon. Very imp.""

""It's jeff feltman,"" Abedin responded, referring to Jeffrey Feltman, who was the US ambassador to Lebanon at the time. ""I'm sure he knows him. I'll talk to jeff.""

Feltman told CNN Wednesday that he never met with Chagoury.

""I have never met nor spoken with Mr Chagoury. I was not aware of the proposal that he speak to me until this email exchange was released, but in any case we never spoke,"" he said.

Judicial Watch President Tom Filton said in a press release that Clinton ""hid"" the 44 emails on purpose.

""No wonder Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin hid emails from the American people, the courts and Congress,"" he said in a press release. ""They show the Clinton Foundation, Clinton donors, and operatives worked with Hillary Clinton in potential violation of the law.""

Clinton defense

Clinton's campaign said the emails didn't relate to her work at the Clinton Foundation.

""Neither of these emails involve the secretary or relate to the Foundation's work,"" said an emailed statement from Clinton campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin. ""They are communications between her aides and the President's personal aide, and indeed the recommendation was for one of the Secretary's former staffers who was not employed by the Foundation.""

The Clinton campaign said Wednesday that Chagoury only wanted to offer insights on the then-upcoming Lebanese election and was not looking for any specific action from the State Department.

""The right-wing organization behind this lawsuit has been attacking the Clintons since the 1990s and no matter how this group tries to mischaracterize these documents, the fact remains that Hillary Clinton never took action as secretary of state because of donations to the Clinton Foundation,"" Schwerin said in a statement.

Trump response

GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump sought to use the emails to paint Clinton as corrupt.

The Clinton Foundation confirmed on May 21, 2015, that it received as much as $26.4 million in previously unreported payments from foreign governments and corporations for paid speeches by the Clintons. It's the latest in a string of admissions from the foundation that it didn't always abide by a 2008 ethics agreement to disclose its funding sources publicly. According to foundation officials, the income -- at least $12 million and as much as more than twice that -- was not disclosed publicly because it was considered and tallied for tax purposes as revenue, rather than donations.

""This is yet more evidence that Hillary Clinton lacks the judgment, character, stability and temperament to be within 1,000 miles of public power,"" said Stephen Miller, Trump's national policy director. ""She views public office as nothing more than a means to personal enrichment -- and every dollar she takes comes at the expense of the public welfare. This latest finding is an unseemly, disturbing window into a corrupt office, and yet more evidence that Hillary Clinton has been lying from the beginning -- and by any reasonable definition attempted to obstruct the investigation of the FBI.""

Trump also tweeted: ""When is the media going to talk about Hillary's policies that have gotten people killed, like Libya, open borders, and maybe her emails?""

When is the media going to talk about Hillary's policies that have gotten people killed, like Libya, open borders, and maybe her emails? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 10, 2016

Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said Wednesday that if the State Department doesn't release all of the remaining Clinton emails by November it will prove the system is ""rigged"" -- a line Trump has used recently.

""Anything less than a full release of these public records before voting begins will only further prove that we have a rigged system that has one set of rules political elites and another for everyone else,"" Priebus said in a statement.

Server investigation

On Wednesday, Judicial Watch released written testimony from Mills, in which she provides further detail on how Clinton's private email server was set up to address potentially security concerns. Mills told the attorneys she spoke with a Clinton IT staffer in 2013, after learning the email account of a close Clinton confidante, Sidney Blumenthal, had been compromised by a hacker.

""As I recall, these discussions involved whether this event might affect Secretary Clinton's email,"" Mills said in follow-up answers to an earlier deposition given to Judicial Watch.

Mills also said she recalls speaking to the same staffer -- Bryan Pagliano -- about the company overseeing the server set up.

""As I recall, these discussions involved whether Platte River Networks would have the technical capacity and be the appropriate source from which to gather Secretary Clinton's email from the clintonemail.com system,"" Mills said.

Early this year as the investigation into Clinton's private email server was in full swing, several FBI field offices approached the Justice Department asking to open a case regarding the relationship between the State Department and the Clinton Foundation, according to a law enforcement official. At the time, DOJ declined because it had looked into allegations surrounding the Clinton Foundation around a year earlier and found there wasn't sufficient evidence to open a case.

In a hearing last month on Capitol Hill, FBI Director James Comey declined to say whether the Clinton Foundation was under investigation, saying: ""I'm not going to comment on the existence or non-existence of any investigation.""

For there to be criminal conflict of interest there would have to be evidence showing a government employee received something of value in exchange, such as a job post-employment or money. There doesn't appear to be anything so far suggesting that in the newly released, heavily redacted emails from Judicial Watch. But those emails do raise questions about whether the relationship between the State Department and Clinton Foundation was too cozy, particularly after Clinton pledged she would not be involved with the foundation when she became secretary of state, in an effort to prevent an inappropriate relationship.

In a case where there's a possible conflict of interest that's not necessarily criminal, the inspector general can look into it and take an administrative remedy if necessary. The State Department OIG has been looking into connections between the State Department and Clinton during her term as secretary of state since earlier this year, but has not said anything about the matter.

The Clinton Foundation has repeatedly said it is not being investigated.

On Tuesday, the Clinton campaign said there is nothing to suggest foul play, and Clinton had nothing to do with the newly released emails. The campaign has said in the past the Clintons don't take a salary from the foundation and all their income is disclosed.

A ███ review of Clinton emails made public by the State Department shows that at least 55 messages now deemed to include classified information appear to have been sent to or from private accounts other than Clinton ’ s . That number is certain to grow substantially as State processes all Clinton emails and sorts through emails turned over to the department by several of her top aides .
Only about a quarter of the former secretary ’ s messages have been released up to this point , and her advisers sent emails on the same topics that never reached Clinton . The nonchalant response to messages stored on commercial servers contrasts sharply with recent FBI efforts to take possession of email copies on a thumb drive maintained by Clinton ’ s attorney David Kendall and on a server kept by a Denver tech company that managed Clinton ’ s account .
“ They are discordant , and they reflect inconsistent notions of information security , ” said Steven Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists . “ They are totally incompatible positions . ”
“ The logic is classic government logic : If I know classified material is in place X , I ’ m going to go get it , ” said one former senior State Department official . “ They ’ re not going to , without reasonable cause , start searching everyone ’ s home email . In a sense , [ Clinton ] is suffering the mortification on behalf of the entire department . ”
The most evident example of the discrepancy in the government ’ s response is the private email account used by former Clinton chief of staff Cheryl Mills .
In a July 31 letter to lawyers for Mills and other former officials , State Department Undersecretary for Management Patrick Kennedy — who had previously allowed ex-officials to keep copies of any records they were returning to the department — struck a newly urgent tone .
“ For records management purposes , the Department asks that you and your client now take steps to return all copies of potential federal records in your possession to the Department as soon as possible , ” Kennedy wrote . “ The Department ’ s Office of Information … will contact you regarding additional steps with respect to the disposition of your and/or your client ’ s electronic copies of these documents . ”
Mills ’ lawyer Beth Wilkinson replied that Mills planned to delete her electronic copies of work-related emails on her personal account after she finished providing copies of those emails to the State Department .
However , U.S. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan stepped in , asking Mills , fellow Clinton aide Huma Abedin and Clinton not to delete any records in their possession . All three agreed .
The result is that any classified emails Mills has in her account now can ’ t be erased without a court order but are housed outside the government ’ s control and without the usual safeguards taken to protect classified information .
The status of Abedin ’ s emails is less clear because most of her work-related emails sent on a private account appear to have involved an account she had on Clinton ’ s server . Attorneys for Mills and Abedin declined to comment for this story .
Because the information was not marked classified at the time it was sent , some of those who now have such messages in their accounts may not even know it . One lawyer reached by ███ expressed surprise that information his client received from Clinton is considered classified .
“ Nobody contacted me , ” said the attorney , who asked not to be named . “ It doesn ’ t make a lot of sense . ”
Asked about efforts to recover classified information from commercial email services , the FBI declined to comment . A State Department official was vague about precise actions .

“ Federal law and our privacy policy prohibits us from disclosing information about our users or their use of our services absent legal process or user consent , ” spokeswoman Natalie Azzoli said .
The former head of the federal government ’ s classification policy office said the discrepancy between the handling of Clinton ’ s server and the private accounts could reflect a conclusion that trying to recover all classified material might just draw more attention to it .
“ In reality , what it does reflect is the challenge that once stuff gets out into the wild , it is almost impossible to corral it again , ” said Bill Leonard , former director of the Information Security Oversight Office . “ When I ’ ve confronted situations like this in the past , one of the first things you should do is a gain-loss type of assessment of what the gain is and what you are losing by trying to corral all this material . Sometimes , just by going after material , you bring more attention to it and cause greater damage than if you just kind of let it lay low . ”
It ’ s also possible the State Department or other authorities have decided to try to recall all copies of “ secret ” or “ top secret ” information but not anything classified at the lowest tier of classification , “ confidential . ”
So far , only one document containing information officially designated “ secret ” has been released — in edited form — from Clinton ’ s email trove : a Nov. 18 , 2012 , memo about arrests in Libya possibly related to the deadly attacks on U.S. facilities in Benghazi two months earlier . The copy of that message forwarded to Clinton does not appear to have circulated outside official but unclassified State Department accounts , although it is difficult to know whether anyone in the chain might have forwarded it to others .
However , intelligence agencies contend that even more sensitive classified information — which should have been marked “ top secret ” — was found during a review of a small sample of Clinton ’ s messages . Those messages reportedly related to drone strikes in Pakistan and nuclear tests in North Korea . The State Department is disputing the classification of those messages .
But even the kind of triage that allows “ confidential ” information to live unmolested outside the government ’ s control would appear to run afoul of claims by some in the intelligence community that individual government employees , as Clinton and her aides were , have a duty to step in whenever classified information appears to have “ spilled . ”
Indeed , some national security specialists have argued that President Barack Obama ’ s executive order on classification and the State Department ’ s rules require that all or most information obtained from a foreign government be classified at least at the “ confidential ” level and treated as such .
Others say that treating all such information as classified would bring the work of the State Department and the National Security Council to a screeching halt .
“ The daily operations of State and , I would add , the White House , would not be possible if everyone put everything on the classified email system that involved foreign government information , ” the former State official said . “ Classification has an element of discretion given to the person responsible for classifying .

Aftergood also noted that State Department regulations actually allow classified “ confidential ” foreign government information to be handled on official , unclassified email accounts under certain circumstances .
That ’ s something that would be anathema at many intelligence agencies where most employees don ’ t even have unclassified work email accounts .
Part of what is playing out in the furor over Clinton ’ s emails is a culture clash between intelligence agencies that allow little or no interaction with the public by their employees and places like State or the White House that must regularly engage journalists , foreign officials and think tanks .

Capitol Hill lawmakers, including top-ranking members of intelligence committees, on Sunday described the terror threat that closed 22 U.S. embassies and consulates across the Muslim region as the most serious one since before the 9/11 attacks and related to a specific act or plot.

Florida Republican Rep. Tom Rooney, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, told Fox News that U.S. intelligence agents detected a “very specific” threat and suggested they have known about it for at least several weeks.

He was among several congressional lawmakers Sunday who said the threat was gleaned from so-called “chatter” from phone lines, computer outlets, websites and other communication outlets.

Rooney also said the information is not what intelligence committee members “see on our regular briefings.”

The Obama administration’s decision Friday to close the U.S. outposts Sunday came the same day as the State Department issued a worldwide travel alert.

Rooney suggested Sunday the travel warning will not be lifted soon.

“If I had plans to travel to certain places in the Middle East, I would probably go ahead and cancel them,” he said.

Rooney's comments followed Georgia Sen. Saxby Chambliss, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, telling NBC’s “Meet the Press"" that the threats are ""very reminiscent of what we saw pre-9/11.""

He also described the threats as “the most serious … I've seen in a number of years.”

Sources confirmed with Fox News the chatter was picked up over the past two weeks and exceeds anything in the past decade. They also said the extraordinary volume of chatter was preceded by months of “absolute quietness.”

The sources said the chatter included Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri demanding that key leaders of the terror network in the Arabian Peninsula step up their activities in the wake of recent killings of top terrorists.

A Mideast diplomat said al-Zawahiri’s “pressuring” of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to launch new terrorist attacks on American and other Western targets is “unprecedented.”

The sources also said the U.S. outpost closings and the travel alert were prompted in part by a series of recent Al Qaeda-led prison breaks that have freed hundreds of operatives over the last month, including one this weekend in Aleppo, Syria. Other recent breaks have been orchestrated in Iraq, Libya and Pakistan and Abu Ghraib, in Afghanistan.

Maryland Rep. C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, also said the intercepted threats came from ""high-level people” in Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.

He told ABC’s “This Week” the information was about a “major attack.""

Yemen is home to Al Qaeda's most dangerous affiliate, blamed for several notable terrorist plots on the United States. They include the foiled Christmas Day 2009 effort to bomb an airliner over Detroit and the explosives-laden parcels intercepted the following year aboard cargo flights.

New York Republican Rep. Pete King, who leads the House Homeland Security subcommittee on counterterrorism and intelligence, said the threat included dates but not locations of possible attacks.

""The threat was specific as to how enormous it was going to be and also that certain dates were given,"" he said on ABC.

Rep. Adam Schiff, a House Intelligence Committee member, said the ""breadth"" of the closures suggests U.S. authorities are concerned about a potential repeat of last year's riots and attacks at multiple embassies, including the deadly assault in Benghazi, Libya, in which the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans were killed.

In addition, Interpol, the French-based international policy agency, has issued a global security alert in connection with suspected Al Qaeda involvement in the recent prison escapes.

Schiff also said the breaks add to the concerns about an attack and noted the approaching end of Ramadan.

""So you have a lot things coming together,” he said. “But all of that would not be enough without having some particularly specific information,"" he said.

The administration’s announcements Friday said the Al Qaeda network might target either U.S. government or private American interests.

The intelligence intercepts also prompted Britain, Germany and France to close their embassies in Yemen on Sunday and Monday. British authorities said some embassy staff in Yemen had been withdrawn ""due to security concerns.""

Canada also announced it was closing its embassy in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

Why are we still talking about a revolving door at the White House?

After promising “change” in America, President Obama officially shut the revolving door on Jan. 21, 2009, in his very first executive order.

“Every appointee in every executive agency” was asked to sign this “ethics pledge,” which would make them “contractually committed … [a]s a condition, and in consideration, of [their] employment in the United States Government in a position invested with the public trust.” Commitment to the “obligations” was “binding” and “enforceable under law.”

While most of Mr. Obama’s executive order was devoted to curbing lobbying, there was also a “revolving door ban,” which affected “all appointees entering government.”

“I will not for a period of 2 years from the date of my appointment participate in any particular matter involving specific parties that is directly and substantially related to my former employer or former clients, including regulations and contracts,” all appointees entering government were asked to vow.

After serving as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s deputy chief of staff, longtime aide Huma Abedin was quietly appointed as a “special government employee” on June 3, 2012.

Lee, Jay Solomon","WASHINGTON—The Obama administration said for the first time on Thursday that its $ 400 million cash payment to Iran in January was used as “ leverage ” to gain the release of American prisoners , fueling criticism that the exchange amounted to the U.S. paying ransom .
State Department spokesman John Kirby confirmed that the U.S. refused to allow Iran to take possession of the cash until a plane carrying the freed Americans had taken off from Tehran .
“ If you ’ re asking me was there a connection in that regard , at the endgame , I ’ m not going to deny that , ” Mr. Kirby said at a State Department news briefing .
“ We took advantage of leverage that we felt we could have to make sure that they got out safely and efficiently , ” he added .
Mr. Kirby was responding to questions about a report in The Wall Street Journal disclosing that an Iranian cargo plane was not permitted by the U.S. to leave Geneva with $ 400 million in euros , Swiss francs and other currencies stacked on shipping pallets until the Americans had left Tehran . The exchange took place on Jan. 17 .
Administration officials , including President Barack Obama , have said the cash payment was not ransom because the $ 400 million was money the U.S. already owed Iran to settle a failed arms deal from more than three decades ago .
The handling of the payment and the timing of the Americans ’ release have drawn criticism from Republicans . U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse ( R. , Neb . ) said Mr. Kirby ’ s statements on Thursday showed the cash transfer to Iran was a ransom payment .
“ If it quacks like a duck , it ’ s a duck , ” Mr. Sasse said . “ If a cash payment is contingent on a hostage release , it ’ s a ransom . The truth matters and the president owes the American people an explanation . ”
Sen. Tom Cotton ( R. , Ark . ) , said the latest reports about the cash payment also sent a message to extremists that “ the United States will pay cold , hard cash for hostages . ”
Republican leaders in Congress have said they are planning to hold hearings on the cash transfer in September .
“ The president owes the American people a full accounting of his actions and the dangerous precedent he has set , ” House Speaker Paul Ryan said Thursday in a statement .
Mr. Kirby said repeatedly that the payment didn ’ t amount to ransom . “ We don ’ t pay ransom , ” he said . Instead , Mr. Kirby portrayed the cash as a useful tool : “ It would have been foolish , imprudent , irresponsible for us not to try to maintain maximum leverage . ”
U.S. officials also have said that the prisoner release and the arms-deal settlement were negotiated through separate diplomatic channels , and denied that the two were linked .
The White House announced in January that the U.S. would pay Iran $ 400 million in the first installment of a $ 1.7 billion settlement the U.S. and Iran reached to resolve a legal dispute over the failed arms deal . Administration officials did not say at the time the $ 400 million already had been paid in cash to Iran and had refused to answer questions about how and when the payment took place .
The administration said the legal dispute could have cost the U.S. some $ 10 billion without January ’ s settlement .","WASHINGTON—The Obama administration said for the first time on Thursday that its $400 million cash payment to Iran in January was used as “leverage” to gain the release of American prisoners, fueling criticism that the exchange amounted to the U.S. paying ransom.

Republican leaders in Congress have said they are planning to hold hearings on the cash transfer in September.

“The president owes the American people a full accounting of his actions and the dangerous precedent he has set,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said Thursday in a statement.

Mr. Kirby said repeatedly that the payment didn’t amount to ransom. “We don’t pay ransom,” he said. Instead, Mr. Kirby portrayed the cash as a useful tool: “It would have been foolish, imprudent, irresponsible for us not to try to maintain maximum leverage.”

U.S. officials also have said that the prisoner release and the arms-deal settlement were negotiated through separate diplomatic channels, and denied that the two were linked.

The White House announced in January that the U.S. would pay Iran $400 million in the first installment of a $1.7 billion settlement the U.S. and Iran reached to resolve a legal dispute over the failed arms deal. Administration officials did not say at the time the $400 million already had been paid in cash to Iran and had refused to answer questions about how and when the payment took place.

The administration said the legal dispute could have cost the U.S. some $10 billion without January’s settlement.

(CNN) Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has surged into the headlines atop a geyser of revelations so dramatic that they may even help President Donald Trump distract the public from his disastrous pandemic response.

Ironically, Pompeo's scandal was propelled by the efforts of the secretary himself -- and his boss -- to keep it quiet. Their decision to get rid of the man charged with investigating any signs of malfeasance at the State Department has only drawn a spotlight, and the closer we look, the more disturbing Pompeo's actions appear.

Investigations by a number of news organizations allege a pattern familiar in the Trump administration: possible abuse of power for personal gain; disdain and circumvention of accepted procedures, and a propensity to treat a government position as a personal fiefdom with little regard for both the taxpayers' money and common decency.

In short, it looks like Pompeo brought the swamp to Foggy Bottom.

On Wednesday, Pompeo ridiculed what he called ""crazy"" stories about him, with a satirical summary mocking the reports: ""someone was walking my dog to sell arms to dry cleaners,"" he gibed. The news reports are not so laughable.

For starters NBC News provided detailed evidence of about two dozen luxurious dinners held by Pompeo and his wife Susan at the State Department's Diplomatic Reception Rooms, all paid for by taxpayers, with guest lists made up more of Republican donors and activists than foreign diplomats and policy experts. (Some 39% of the nearly 500 invitees were from Fox News, NBC reported.) But that's only part of the unfolding narrative.

It became apparent late last Friday that something worth hiding was brewing under Pompeo, when Trump announced his intention to fire the State Department's Inspector General, Steve Linick. Inspectors general are Senate-confirmed government officials charged with auditing and investigating potential instances of fraud and abuse in the government.

Pompeo acknowledged Wednesday that he asked Trump to fire Linick, but offered scant explanation for the reason, other than that it should have happened sooner. He called claims that the firing was retribution for probes into his activities ""patently false.""

Moments after the announcement, Democratic Rep. Eliot Engel -- chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs -- dropped the first bombshell, revealing that Linick was investigating Pompeo. Engel, with Sen. Bob Menendez, ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, opened a probe into the ouster, decrying ""the politically-motivated firing of inspectors general and the President's gutting of these critical positions."" Later, NBC reported that Linick was investigating Pompeo's use of a State Department political appointee to conduct personal errands, such as walking his dog and picking up his laundry.

Within hours, the accusations grew more disturbing. Engel told CNN of another possible reason for Linick's firing. The inspector general, it turns out, was investigating the declaration of an ""emergency"" that Pompeo had cited one year ago as reason for bypassing the requirement that Congress approve an $8 billion sale of weapons to Saudi Arabia.

Engel, who called the declaration ""phony,"" said Linick was conducting an investigation of it at his office's request. The New York Times reported that Pompeo had already answered written questions into that probe.

But now there's more.

The NBC investigation identified the dog-walking staffer, whose name appeared in the emails NBC reviewed in connection with the so-called Madison Dinners. The staffer was the principal liaison between Pompeo's office and the protocol office that organized the dinners. ""Two administration officials told NBC News that Linick made some type of inquiry to the protocol office last week, before he was fired,"" NBC reported. ""One of the officials said Pompeo's office was then notified."" Was Linick also investigating Pompeo's dinners? That remains unclear.

Last Sunday , both columnists wrote about the damaging report from the State Department ’ s Inspector General , which concluded that putting her State Department email on a private server was authorized by no one but the self-appointed queen herself . Even the network newscasts , so normally supportive of the presumptive Democratic nominee , subtly implied Mrs. Clinton ’ s self-defenses had been exposed as lies . But these two columnists concluded she was only guilty of a self-inflicted wound on her campaign .
Milbank ’ s column was headlined “ Hunkered Hillary made things worse. ” The pull quote from the Marcus column was “ The greatest irony may be that the Clintonian urge for privacy produces the opposite of what she needs . ”
Here ’ s the blind spot : Both think she doesn ’ t match Trump ’ s nickname “ Crooked Hillary. ” She ’ s just too scared of the Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy and overreaches . Her “ instinctive caution ” got the best of her .
Marcus protested this was just a dumb mistake , and a “ massive failure of staff ” that no one talked Hillary out of a private server .

These columnists speak negatively of Clinton ’ s “ accusers , ” the ones responsible for giving Hillary “ scar tissue ” with their “ politically motivated attacks and endless investigations , ” as Republican partisans .

Take the Clinton Foundation . Imagine a Republican administration where a former president ’ s wife became Secretary of State , while he accepted huge donations from foreign countries seeking preferential treatment in Washington , DC . Would anyone ever think that would be permitted ?

Some reports suggested Trump had also threatened to withhold military aid from Ukraine, and therefore was guilty of quid pro quo. But, the phone transcript, which the White House released, did not provide credence to that claim.

President Trump dismissed the deposition as a `` kangaroo court '' as he defended the decision to block Gordon Sondland from appearing at the closed-door session on Capitol Hill .
But the move , first reported by the New York Times , prompted new warnings from Democrats that such acts will be seen as an obstruction of their investigation into the controversy surrounding Trump ’ s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky .
“ The failure to produce this witness , the failure to produce these documents , we consider yet additional strong evidence of obstruction of the constitutional functions of Congress , ” House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff , D-Calif. , told reporters Tuesday morning .
HOUSE DEMS SUBPOENA PENTAGON , WHITE HOUSE BUDGET OFFICE IN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY
Schiff and other top Democratic committee chairmen later released a statement saying they indeed consider the administration ’ s “ interference ” to be “ obstruction of the impeachment inquiry ” and they plan to subpoena Sondland “ for both his testimony and documents . ”
The statement said they learned Tuesday morning from Sondland ’ s attorneys that the State Department left a voicemail at 12:30 a.m. telling them he could not appear . Further , they said the attorneys reported that Sondland turned communications sought by the committees over to the department , which “ is withholding them from the Committees , in defiance of our subpoena to Secretary [ Mike ] Pompeo . ”
An attorney for Sondland also said in a statement that the order not to appear came from the State Department . Attorney Robert Luskin said Sondland , who had agreed to appear voluntarily for the closed session , is required to follow the department 's direction . No reason for the direction was cited , he said .
Luskin said Sondland `` is profoundly disappointed that he will not be able to testify . '' His statement said : `` Ambassador Sondland hopes that the issues raised by the State Department that preclude his testimony will be resolved promptly . He stands ready to testify on short notice , whenever he is permitted to appear . ''
Trump tweeted that while he would `` love '' to send Sondland to testify , he `` would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court , where Republican ’ s rights have been taken away , and true facts are not allowed out for the public to see . ''
In the July phone call , which was flagged as part of a whistleblower complaint , Trump urged Zelensky to look into possible interference by Ukraine in the 2016 election as well as former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter ’ s conduct in the country .
Democrats claim that Trump used $ 400 million in military aid as leverage in a quid pro quo for the Ukrainians to investigate a political opponent , and opened an impeachment inquiry , firing off a raft of subpoenas within a few days to top administration and White House officials . While a call transcript shows the president urging a Biden-related investigation , Trump denies any 'quid pro quo ' claims .
Sondland is a wealthy hotelier , philanthropist and contributor to political campaigns . He is a key figure as he had texted with Bill Taylor , a top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine , arguing over allegations of a quid pro quo .
In early September , Taylor wrote : `` Are we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations ? ''
Days later , he followed up : `` As I said over the phone , I think it 's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign . ''
Sondland responded , defending the president : `` Bill , I believe you are incorrect about President Trump 's intentions . The President has been crystal clear : no quid pro quo ’ s of any kind . The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign . ”
According to a source familiar with the conversation , Sondland called Trump after Taylor texted him about the possibility that aid to Ukraine was being witheld for political reasons .
The source told Fox News that Sondland thought putting aid on hold was a bad idea , and that he then decided to ask Trump directly -- asking him : “ What do do you want ? ” The source says Trump responded that he didn ’ t “ want ” anything and that there was no quid pro quo .
The decision to block Sondland 's appearance comes as Democrats have been pushing forward with their inquiry . On Monday , House Democrats issued a fresh round of subpoenas to the Pentagon and the White House Office of Management and Budget for documents relating to reports that Trump ordered then-acting OMB Chief Mick Mulvaney to freeze aid to Ukraine .
On Saturday , Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reiterated prior statements that he would oppose any `` harassment '' of department employees by Congress .
One U.S. government official told Fox News regarding the directive blocking Sondland that the view at the State Department and White House is that House Democrats are not playing by the rules , suggesting the administration will cooperate in the investigation once they do .
And Rep. Jim Jordan , R-Ohio , cited the publication of the text messages in defending the administration 's decision .
`` If you 're going to selectively leak text messages ... and not give full context and not give the full transcript , we understand why they made the decision at this moment , '' he said .","The Trump administration ordered the U.S. ambassador to the European Union not to appear at a scheduled Tuesday deposition on the Ukraine controversy, triggering a fiery new clash with House Democrats amid their impeachment inquiry.

One U.S. government official told Fox News regarding the directive blocking Sondland that the view at the State Department and White House is that House Democrats are not playing by the rules, suggesting the administration will cooperate in the investigation once they do.

And Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, cited the publication of the text messages in defending the administration's decision.

""If you're going to selectively leak text messages ... and not give full context and not give the full transcript, we understand why they made the decision at this moment,"" he said.

It's difficult to tell how much was specifically allocated for Benghazi. Tripoli was the only post mentioned in the department's fiscal 2013 request -- funding for that location did slip, from $11.5 million in fiscal 2011 to $10.1 million the following year. Slightly more has been requested for fiscal 2013.

Still, then-Deputy Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security Charlene Lamb testified in October that the size of the attack -- and not the money -- was the issue.

Asked if there was any budget consideration that led her not to increase the security force, she said: ""No.""

She added: ""This was an unprecedented attack in size."" Asked again about budget issues, Lamb said: ""Sir, if it's a volatile situation, we will move assets to cover that.""

Asked Wednesday about Lamb's testimony, Clinton noted that the review board that examined the Libya attack found budget issues have played a role.

""That's why you have an independent group like an (Accountability Review Board), that's why it was created to look at everything,"" Clinton said.",www.foxnews.com,right,yr5YrIXn5hYGhxap

“ Instead of bending over backwards to try to placate the Iranian regime , the White House needs to be holding it accountable for its recent missile tests , its continued support for terrorism , and its wrongful imprisonment of Americans , ” House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce , R-Calif. , said in a statement to FoxNews.com .
At issue are tightened security requirements for America ’ s visa waiver program , which allows citizens of 38 countries to travel to the U.S. without visas . Under changes in the newly signed spending bill , people from those countries who have traveled to Iran , Iraq , Syria and Sudan in the past five years must now obtain visas to enter the U.S .
Top Tehran officials , however , complained the changes violate the terms of the nuclear deal , which says the U.S. and other world powers will refrain from any policy intended to adversely affect normalization of trade and economic relations with Iran .
Kerry responded to these concerns in a Dec. 19 letter to his Iranian counterpart , Mohammad Javad Zarif -- and suggested the administration could simply bypass the rules for Iran .
“ I am also confident that the recent changes in visa requirements passed in Congress , which the Administration has the authority to waive , will not in any way prevent us from meeting our [ nuclear deal ] commitments , and that we will implement them so as not to interfere with legitimate business interests of Iran , ” he said .
Kerry ’ s letter to Zarif assured that the U.S. would “ adhere to the full measure of our commitments. ” As for changes to the visa program , Kerry floated several alternative options for easing any impact on Iran – including waiving the new requirements .
“ To this end , we have a number of potential tools available to us , including multiple entry ten-year business visas , programs for expediting business visas , and the waiver authority provided under the new legislation , ” he wrote .
The legislation indeed includes a provision allowing the Homeland Security secretary to waive the requirements if the secretary determines this “ is in the law enforcement or national security interests of the United States . ”
But House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy , R-Calif. , voiced concern on Monday that Kerry was proposing a “ blanket ” waiver to accommodate Iran ’ s complaints . He said that is not Congress ’ intent .
“ Contrary to what the Secretary of State seems to be saying to Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif , it was not and has never been Congress ’ s intent to allow the Administration to grant a blanket waiver to travellers from Iran in order to facilitate the implementation of the Iran deal , ” he said in a statement .
McCarthy said the point of the legislation was to strengthen security and “ keep the American people safe from terrorism and from foreign travelers who potentially pose a threat to our homeland . ”
Kerry ’ s assurances also raised concerns that the U.S. may be backing down to Iran ’ s complaints while at the same time reluctant to punish Tehran for its own potential violations .
“ Instead of undermining Congressional intent regarding the visa waiver program , the White House should instead focus on Iran ’ s repeated violations of the U.N. Security Council 's bans on missile tests , ” McCarthy said . “ Iran ’ s unwillingness to follow these international agreements should be a red flag that the Iran nuclear deal isn ’ t worth the paper it is written on . ”
Omri Ceren , with the Washington , D.C.-based Israel Project , also told The Washington Free Beacon , “ According to the Obama administration ’ s latest interpretation , the nuclear deal allows Iran to test ballistic missiles in violation of international law , but does not allow Congress to prevent terrorists from coming into the United States . ”
The same article noted that the State Department official in charge of implementing the nuclear agreement warned Congress last week that the new visa rules “ could have a very negative impact on the deal . ”
Indeed , Kerry ’ s letter came as top-ranking Iranian officials accused the U.S. of flouting the nuclear agreement .
Iran ’ s Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Sunday that the change “ contradicts ” the nuclear deal .
`` Definitely , this law adversely affects economic , cultural , scientific and tourism relations , ” Araghchi was quoted by state TV as saying .
Asked about Kerry ’ s assurances at Monday ’ s daily briefing , State Department spokesman John Kirby said the secretary made clear they would “ implement this new legislation so as not to interfere with legitimate business interests of Iran . ”
Kirby said the law would be followed , but there are a “ number of potential tools ” to ensure this does not violate the nuclear deal . As for the DHS waiver authority , he said it ’ s too soon to say “ if and when ” that might be used .
