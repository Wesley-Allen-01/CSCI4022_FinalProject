""The Secretary did not speak to the President this morning and is unaware of the reason, but he is grateful for the opportunity to serve, and still believes strongly that public service is a noble calling and not to be regretted.""

Tillerson and Trump have had a tempestuous relationship, so it was not shocking that Tillerson would be removed.

However, the timing of Tillerson's firing was a surprise, given the diplomatic workload at the moment.

On Thursday, Trump shocked the world by accepting an invitation to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, which would make him the first sitting U.S. president to meet with a North Korean leader. It's possible that Tillerson's removal was made with that meeting in mind, if Trump wanted Pompeo by his side for the historic occasion.

He's also moving forward with a Middle East peace plan after angering the Arab world by announcing the U.S. would move its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.

And the administration continues to deal with Russia and its entanglement in the 2016 presidential election — with critics charging that Trump has not taken a tough enough approach with the government of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

There were differences in rhetoric between Tillerson and the White House on foreign policy, including on Monday, when Tillerson pointed the finger at Moscow over the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in London. The White House earlier in the day had notably not blamed Russia for the incident, despite claims from Great Britain's prime minister.

Late last year, speculation mounted in Washington that Tillerson would be replaced, and reports circulated that Pompeo could be his successor.

Tillerson was one of the first Cabinet secretaries to be confirmed in the Trump administration, but his brief tenure has been rocked by criticism and continuing signs of low morale at the State Department, where he has often been perceived as an absent leader.

Tillerson, a low-key Texan, never felt comfortable in Washington and did his best to work in private and avoid the media. He faced scrutiny in Washington, even from Republican lawmakers, as he has overseen a controversial redesign of the State Department that has been unpopular among officials there.

Many career diplomats have exited under his leadership, and Tillerson has reportedly clashed with White House officials on key appointments.

Pompeo, meanwhile, is viewed as one of Trump’s most trusted Cabinet members. He reportedly meets nearly daily with Trump to brief him on national security, which requires him to travel from CIA headquarters in Virginia to the White House.

Pompeo, a former Republican congressman, has taken a decidedly more hawkish stance than Tillerson on matters such as North Korea and the Iran nuclear deal.

In a statement, Pompeo said he was “deeply grateful” to Trump for allowing him to serve as CIA chief and now secretary of State. He will now need to be confirmed by the full Senate to lead the State Department.

“If confirmed, I look forward to guiding the world’s finest diplomatic corps in formulating and executing the President’s foreign policy,” Pompeo said. “In my time as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, I have worked alongside many remarkable Foreign Service officers and Department of State leaders serving here in the United States and on the very edge of freedom.”

Tillerson’s removal comes days before he was slated to testify before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the department’s fiscal year 2019 budget request. The State Department, like other agencies, has been dealt deep cuts in the Trump administration's funding proposals, while the departments of Defense and Homeland Security have seen their budgets increased.

The decision to replace Tillerson, a former CEO of Exxon Mobil Corp., throws into further uncertainty the State Department’s most senior ranks. The agency has seen an exodus of longtime career officials under Tillerson, which has been highlighted in recent months by the departures of some of the department's most experienced diplomats.

Despite Tillerson’s rocky tenure at the State Department, he has indicated in more recent months that he planned to remain at the agency for the foreseeable future. He told CNN in an interview in January that he intended to stay on at least through 2018.

“I intend to be here for the whole year,” he said at the time.

The choice has proven controversial among many watchers , Republican , Democrat , and nonpartisan . When several Republican senators have spoken against you , you know something 's up ; Politico 's Blake Hounshell reports an unnamed State Department staffer 's reaction : `` I 've been resisting the urge to drink since 7 a.m. when I read the news . ''
But I see Tillerson as an excellent , very inspired pick . Let me explain .
The objections come down to mainly two things : Tillerson 's qualifications , and his seemingly friendly ties to Vladimir Putin , who ( now infamously ) awarded Tillerson Russia 's Order of Friendship . Let 's take those gripes one by one .
Dealing with governments is an integral part of running a major oil company . Governments play key roles in any energy deals , and dealing with those governments is part of the job . An in-depth feature by Politico 's Hounshell describes Tillerson 's rise through the ranks at ExxonMobil as driven at least in part by his skill — and toughness — in dealing with governments , including trouble spot governments .

Before being assigned to Russia , Tillerson spent three weeks in the Library of Congress reading books about Russian history and politics . He 's no dummy .
Just because he did n't take part in international negotiations and geostrategic thinking as a State Department diplomat or member of a Senate committee does n't mean he does n't know how to do those things ; in fact , he has done them throughout his career , and pretty successfully as far as we can tell . That makes him exceptionally qualified . More qualified , at least on paper , than Mitt Romney , another contender for Trump 's secretary of state , whose jobs at Bain Capital and as a state governor involved comparatively very little international diplomatic work . Romney may have made an excellent secretary of state given his intelligence , his formidable negotiating skills , and his deep interest in global issues , but the point remains that , resume-to-resume , Tillerson is more qualified .
Now , let 's talk about Russia . Russia is an enormous oil producer . Doing business in Russia , given its autocratic and kleoptocratic system , requires having good relationships with key players , especially Vladimir Putin . Tillerson 's job as CEO of ExxonMobil was to improve the net present value to shareholders of his company , and that involved having a good relationship with Putin . Secretary of state is a different job , promoting different interests . Just because Putin and Tillerson had a cordial working relationship does n't mean Tillerson will automatically kowtow to Putin and Russia as secretary of state .
Notably , Tillerson comes endorsed by GOP foreign policy grandees from both its realist and hawkish wings , including Robert Gates and Dick Cheney , neither of them especially noted Russophiles , and Condoleezza Rice , whose PhD and early career work is on Russia . `` If you want to understand Rex Tillerson , and it may be a corny thing to say , but you 've got to understand that he 's an Eagle Scout , '' Gates said . It would be corny coming from almost anyone but Gates , who is universally respected on both sides of the aisle .
Tillerson is also a good pick for another , crucial reason : He and Trump seem to have hit it off .

This week, Donald Trump picked ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as his nominee for secretary of state. The choice has proven controversial among many watchers, Republican, Democrat, and nonpartisan.

Tillerson is also a good pick for another, crucial reason: He and Trump seem to have hit it off. This is important when serving a president who values personal relationships so much and who is so unprepared for many parts of his job. As Hounshell notes, Tillerson seems like the kind of man that Trump imagines himself to be — a tough, smart, international dealmaker.

state_department,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jun/11/ambassador-irked-baseless-prostitute-allegations/,Damage control: Hillary Clinton loyalists suspected of criminal cover-ups for diplomats,2013-06-11,Guy Taylor,"Congress and the State Department ’ s inspector general are examining allegations that senior officials working under Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton may have suppressed investigations into suspected criminal activity among U.S. diplomats abroad — including the alleged solicitation of prostitutes by an ambassador in Europe .
Lawmakers from both parties said the charges are “ very serious ” — and point out the need for a permanent inspector general at the State Department . A deputy inspector general has been active in recent years , but the department ’ s top watchdog post , tasked with investigating practices at roughly 260 embassies worldwide , has been vacant for more than five years .
A spokesman for office of inspector general said Tuesday that the probe into “ allegations of quashing ” by State Department higher-ups was triggered by a 2012 office of inspector general review of the department ’ s Bureau of Diplomatic Security .
That review uncovered complaints by some officials that they were not allowed to thoroughly investigate the allegations of criminal activity . As a result , the office of inspector general has hired independent law enforcement specialists to examine the complaints and the extent to which investigators within the Bureau of Diplomatic Security are being allowed the level of independence required to do their jobs effectively .
In addition to reviewing “ eight allegations of criminal misconduct ” that arose during the 2012 review , Doug Welty , a spokesman for the office of inspector general , said the office is “ also looking into the allegations of quashing . ”
Mr. Welty made the remarks as Undersecretary of State Patrick F. Kennedy issued a statement to reporters Tuesday saying he has “ never once interfered , nor would I condone interfering , in any investigation . ”
Mr. Welty and others at the State Department have declined to comment on the specific allegations related to “ quashing . ”
But Mr. Kennedy apparently made the statement in response to the CBS News report this week that insinuated that he was involved in suppressing an investigation into the activities of a U.S. ambassador accused of patronizing prostitutes in a public park .
Citing “ sources , ” CBS News reported that after the accusation surfaced , the ambassador was called to Washington to meet with Mr. Kennedy , but then was permitted to return to his post .
CBS also reported that officials from the State Department ’ s Bureau of Diplomatic Security told the office of inspector general that they were told to stop investigating the case .
The State Department has vigorously rejected the CBS report . A senior spokeswoman called it “ preposterous ” to claim the department would not vigorously investigate allegations of criminal misconduct .
Department officials have remained vague , however , about the details of the allegations in question .
As spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki refused Tuesday to confirm or deny whether a U.S. ambassador had been accused of patronizing prostitutes , U.S . Ambassador to Belgium Howard Gutman emailed an abrupt statement to reporters , saying he was “ angered and saddened ” by “ baseless allegations that have appeared in the press . ”
“ I live on a beautiful park in Brussels that you walk through to get to many locations , and at no point have I ever engaged in any improper activity , ” Mr. Gutman said in the statement .
“ To watch the four years I have proudly served in Belgium smeared is devastating , ” he said .
The ambassador ’ s denial appeared to represent the first official acknowledgment of the various allegations of criminal activity cited in the CBS News report .
According to the Center For Responsive Politics , Mr. Gutman was a key Obama fundraiser in 2008 , bundling at least $ 775,000 for the president ’ s campaign and the Inaugural Committee .
A separate allegation was reportedly made against a State Department security official in Beirut accused of sexually assaulting foreign nationals hired as embassy guards . In another , members of Mrs. Clinton ’ s security detail were accused of regularly pursuing prostitutes while on official trips in foreign countries . Another referenced a suspected illegal narcotics ring tied to State Department contractors at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad .
When pressed for details Tuesday about the cases and an explanation as to whether Mr. Gutman has been cleared from the allegations made against him , Ms. Psaki responded that “ there are some investigations that are still ongoing , some that have been concluded . ”
“ I ’ m not going to break down individual cases , ” she said , adding that all of the allegations in question were “ unsubstantiated . ”
One State Department official said that the allegations of criminal activity as well as the allegations of quashing by department higher-ups may have been born out of an anonymous survey given to officials in the Bureau of Diplomatic Security as part of the office of inspector general ’ s 2012 review of the bureau ’ s activities . “ One of the first things they do is a survey , sent out to employees , contractors , etc. , ” the official said . “ It ’ s all confidential and sometimes these issues come up . Then , these same people who filled out the survey have an opportunity to speak to inspectors confidentially and sometimes that ’ s when the allegations come up .
“ Allegations are allegations , ” the official added . “ Not until they can be substantiated and verified do they become findings . ”
The situation is drawing increasing attention , meanwhile , on Capitol Hill , where lawmakers from both sides of the isle have begun expressing concern .
“ I am appalled not only at the reported misconduct itself , but at the reported interference in the investigations of the misconduct , ” said Rep. Ed Royce , California Republican and chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs .
If there was interference by State Department officials in investigations being conducted by the Bureau of Diplomatic Security , it “ must be uncovered , ” said Mr. Royce , who added that he has asked his staff “ to begin an investigation into these allegations . ”
In a letter to Secretary of State John F. Kerry , Mr. Royce wrote that “ the notion that any or all of these cases would not be investigated thoroughly by the [ State ] Department is unacceptable . ”
A spokesman for Sen. Robert Menendez , New Jersey Democrat and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , said reports that the State Department dropped or influenced investigations into allegations of misconduct “ are very serious and require a dispassionate investigation of the facts . ”
“ The committee is looking into the alleged actions , and this situation underscores the need for an appointment of a permanent inspector general for the Department of State to assure that allegations of this sort are quickly , fully , and appropriately addressed , ” the Menendez spokesman said in an email to Politico on Tuesday .","Congress and the State Department’s inspector general are examining allegations that senior officials working under Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton may have suppressed investigations into suspected criminal activity among U.S. diplomats abroad — including the alleged solicitation of prostitutes by an ambassador in Europe.

Their Twitter fighting is ostensibly over a technical issue in the Iran negotiations ; Sanger had published a story reporting Iran had developed new nuclear fuel , which he suggested was a major embarrassment for the administration and bad for the Iran nuclear deal .
Harf basically argued that Sanger had misunderstood and misinterpreted the latest nuclear development . And , on balance , Harf 's criticisms are correct , and Sanger 's story elided some technical issues that make it clear this is nowhere near as big of a deal as he claims . But like so many arguments in Washington over Iran , it 's about much more than that .
The argument : does Iran 's latest nuclear step create a big problem for the US ?
On Monday , Sanger reported in the Times , based on a new study , that `` Tehran 's stockpile of nuclear fuel increased about 20 percent over the last 18 months of negotiations . '' Sanger framed this as embarrassing for the Obama administration and a step back in the Iran nuclear negotiations . The development `` poses a major diplomatic and political challenge for President Obama , '' Sanger wrote , `` partially undercutting the Obama administration 's contention that the Iranian program had been 'frozen . ' ''
Harf , who is currently acting as State Department spokesperson , said later she was `` perplexed '' by the story 's contentions , pointing out that Iran had not violated any agreements and arguing that Sanger had overblown a minor development into a major issue . `` The notion that this is some big issue of concern of negotiation is more manufacturing a controversy than actual reality , '' she said .
For those at State Dept . `` perplexed '' by story on Iran today , it 's worth reading this study : http : //t.co/ecPNTnGRYR https : //t.co/g4uKh8RhHZ — David Sanger ( @ SangerNYT ) June 3 , 2015
. @ SangerNYT You can tweet all the ISIS reports you want - does n't change the fact that main contentions in your story were wrong . — Marie Harf ( @ marieharf ) June 3 , 2015
( Harf sent a few more tweets as well ; you can see them here . )
What was interesting , watching this unfold , is that it prompted two entirely separate conversations . One , among mostly conservative national security writers and think tankers , expressed dismay at the Obama administration 's defensiveness and its apparent refusal to acknowledge the cold , hard facts spelled out in the study . The other , among arms control experts , actually dug into those facts and ultimately ended up siding with Harf .
How the Times got the technical issue right and its significance wrong
The first issue , as a number of people pointed out , is that Sanger had used the phrase `` nuclear fuel '' to describe the growth in Iran 's nuclear program , which is both true and misleading . Iran has produced a specific category of nuclear fuel called low-enriched uranium ( LEU ) , which is used for power plants or other peaceful purposes , not for nuclear warheads .
Sanger implies that this goes against the Joint Plan of Action ( JPOA ) , Iran 's 2013 temporary nuclear agreement with the US , meant as bridge until final negotiations are concluded this summer . In fact , Iran 's development of more LEU is within the agreement , so for Sanger to write that it `` undercuts '' anything is incorrect .
Once the final nuclear deal with Iran comes into effect , based on the framework of that deal that was agreed upon in April , Iran will still be allowed to produce LEU — but it will only be allowed to keep a small stockpile on hand . The idea here is that LEU in itself is not terribly dangerous , and that both the production and the stockpile will be under close international monitoring to make sure Iran does n't try to turn the LEU into highly enriched uranium ( HEU ) , which is dangerous . However , the deal will limit how much LEU Iran is allowed to have on hand at any given time ; the country will be required to ship it out or else convert it to , for example , fuel rods .
This gets to the heart of Sanger 's argument : he is correct that Iran is building up a much larger stockpile of LEU than it will be allowed to have if the final deal comes into effect . To be clear , this activity does not violate any agreements currently in force . However , if the deal comes into effect , and if Iran wants to comply with that deal , then it will have to convert almost all of that LEU into some other form , such as fuel rods , or ship it out of the country . There is nothing preventing Iran from doing all of this in a way that complies with the deal .
A representative tweet from the arms control community , which seemed to collectively roll its eyes at Sanger 's story :
Growth in # Iran 's LEU stockpile is a non-issue , as long as excess is fed into oxide conversion by 30 June . — Mark Fitzpatrick ( @ FitzpatrickIISS ) June 2 , 2015
`` Iran 's LEU is up somewhat , yes , but contrary to headline , it does n't 'complicate ' talks . IranDeal will cut [ the size of Iran 's LEU stockpile ] to 300kg , '' Arms Control Association director Daryl Kimball wrote , calling Sanger 's story `` a superficial analysis . ''
It 's also important to point out that Iran is developing this new LEU under the view of the international community in its officially declared facilities . If the Iranians really wanted to cheat , they would almost certainly construct a secret facility somewhere — as they 've done in the past — and do it there .
That does not mean that it 's great news that Iran is enriching more LEU . Certainly , everyone 's lives would be easier if Iran unilaterally surrendered its entire nuclear program or at least took no more steps toward nuclear development . But Iran is continuing to conduct the sorts of nuclear activities that it is allowed under the JPOA ( a deal that even Sen. Lindsey Graham , an Iran super-hawk , now supports ) , which should not be particularly surprising . It is a real stretch to argue , as Sanger does , that this enrichment `` poses a major political and diplomatic challenge '' to the Iran deal .
This is , in many ways , a repeat of the same argument that Washington has been having since 2013 , when the JPOA was signed and the US and Iran began down the road to a nuclear deal . Supporters of the deal , joined since April 's framework agreement by a chorus of arms control experts , say the deal is about the best feasible option we have for limiting Iran 's nuclear enrichment .
Iran hawks argue that this is all based on a false premise that the Iran nuclear program is actually the core problem . Rather , they believe , the real problem is inherent to the Iranian regime itself , and that because the nuclear deal will not force regime change , it elides and thus perpetuates that problem .
This is why you see so much arguing between these two sides over every little technical blip along the way . For Iran hawks , episodes like this one just prove there is no such thing as a `` good '' nuclear deal because Iran is so inherently evil that it will find a way to exploit any deal to its advantage . Deal supporters and arms control experts , meanwhile , see that the deal will dramatically limit Iran 's nuclear development , as well as make it much harder for the country to cheat , and thus go a long way to prevent both a nuclear bomb and the need for a disastrous war with Iran .
This is why you get lots of arguments over questions like `` Is Iran violating the JPOA in spirit , if not in letter ? '' because for Iran hawks everything Iran does violates the spirit of the agreement because Tehran can only ever be dishonest and warlike .
It 's why people on both sides spend lots of time debating the degree to which Iran is `` rational . '' If Iran is rational , the incentives of the deal are much more likely to lead it to comply . But that word `` rational '' ends up becoming very hard to define and clear standards very hard to set . Was the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 rational ? If it was n't , does that mean America is incapable of rationally responding to incentives , and must be destroyed for the sake of world peace ?
You can see how these debates almost immediately veer away from the factual into the theoretical and the indefinable . They are also , by the way , only tangentially related to technical issues such as whether Iran 's latest LEU enrichment violates the JPOA . These debates are maddeningly unanswerable and unending . Most people in Washington who work on this issue , having long ago exhausted their arguments on this many times over , try to avoid rehearsing the debate .

WASHINGTON – The State Department on Saturday warned American citizens in South Africa of the imminent threat of terrorist attacks.

The warning, issued by the U.S. Diplomatic Mission to South Africa, states that the government has received information that terrorist groups are planning to carry out ""near-term attacks against places where U.S. citizens congregate in South Africa, such as upscale shopping areas and malls in Johannesburg and Cape Town.""

The warning refers to the public call by the Islamic State, or ISIL, to conduct terrorist strikes during the coming month of Ramadan.

The State Department has issued similar warnings to U.S. citizens living or traveling in Europe, saying credible information exists about ISIL militants planning attacks there.

On Friday, the Pentagon announced that it had conducted several strikes – some of them kept secret until now – against Islamic extremists outside of Iraq and Syria as the military widens its attacks on militants. In 2016 alone, U.S. attacks in Yemen have killed more than 100 militants, according to U.S. Central Command, which oversees operations in the Middle East.

The most recent airstrike against Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula occurred on May 19 in central Yemen and killed four al-Qaeda operatives. It was the ninth attack in Yemen this year, including several the military had announced since March. Central Command also confirmed three previously unannounced attacks in Yemen. Strikes on Feb. 3, Feb. 29 and March 30 killed 11 al-Qaeda fighters

The military didn't disclose those attacks immediately in order to confuse militants and act swiftly on intelligence gathered at the sites, Air Force Col. Patrick Ryder, a Central Command spokesman, told reporters on Friday.

“Sometimes the chatter that comes after a strike allows us to collect more intelligence on adversaries to conduct future strikes,” Ryder said.

Meantime, in Iraq and Syria, the U.S.-led coalition continued to attack ISIL, hitting 25 targets, the military command in Baghdad announced Saturday. Those attacks came as Syrian troops advanced on Raqqa, the self-proclaimed capital of ISIL, and the suicide bombers struck in Iraq, killing 15 people in and around Baghdad.",www.usatoday.com,center,sOJP3WTndokfiWTV

state_department,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/9/huma-abedin-formally-investigated-embezzlement/,"Huma Abedin, top Clinton aide, formally investigated by feds for embezzlement",2015-09-09,John Solomon,"Federal investigators formally investigated top Hillary Rodham Clinton aide Huma Abedin for the crime of embezzlement after confirming she took a “ Babymoon ” vacation and maternity time at the State Department without expending her formal leave , resulting in thousands of dollars of pay she wasn ’ t entitled to receive , The ███ has learned .
The probe also gathered evidence she filed time sheets charging the government for impermissible overtime and excessive hours after she converted from a full-time federal employee to a State Department contractor .
Those timecards were filed during a period that remains under investigation over questions about possible conflicts of interest , documents gathered by the State Department inspector general show .
Ms. Abedin , who served as a deputy chief of staff to Mrs. Clinton from 2009 to late 2012 , told investigators she hadn ’ t noticed she had received a $ 33,000 lump sum payment — about a third of which investigators determined was improper — when she left the State Department .
She suggested her husband , the disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner , failed to let her know .
“ My husband handles all the finances in our household , ” she told investigators during a recorded interview in October 2014 .
She said she only learned of the payment after being contacted by investigators two years after her departure . “ I did ask my husband to look up our bank statements , and we did have a deposit , ” she said during her interview .
She also acknowledged it was likely she did not fill out the required form when she went on a two-week vacation to Europe in 2011 while she was pregnant — a trip she called a “ Babymoon ” in emails and her interview .
The failure to file the form resulted in her having excessive vacation time cashed out to her in the lump payment upon leaving government , investigators concluded .
“ You are 100 percent right on the Babymoon . I don ’ t recall . One hundred percent right . I don ’ t recall filling out any paperwork saying I was taking leave , ” she told the investigators . “ I ’ m not even going to blame it on my pregnancy brain . ”
The State Department ’ s inspector general formally concluded that Ms. Abedin failed to correctly submit multiple required time sheet and leave forms covering her vacation and maternity leave , resulting in an overpayment of $ 10,674.32 that she wasn ’ t entitled to receive when she left her job .
The Abedin investigation ’ s existence has been known for weeks , but the contents and findings have never been publicly released .
Sen. Chuck Grassley , Iowa Republican and chairman of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary , has repeatedly questioned Ms. Abedin ’ s compensation and work arrangements under Mrs. Clinton , suggesting she was overpaid and may have engaged in conflicts of interest when she worked both for State as a contractor and a firm in New York connected to friends of the Clinton family .
Ms. Abedin ’ s lawyer , Miguel Rodriguez , has accused the senator of a smear job in suggesting there was any criminality .
The documents provided to The Times by a source outside the Senate or the IG ’ s office make clear , however , the inquiry was clearly criminal in nature and ultimately referred to federal prosecutors .
Mr. Rodriguez did not immediately return a call seeking comment from The Times on Wednesday .
However , he sent a letter to the OIG disputing its conclusions , saying investigators should have credited Ms. Abedin for the time she worked while off rather than demand she repay the money .
“ I am deeply troubled by gaps in the OIG ’ s investigation , holes in its methodology , unsupported allegations , as well as its conclusory demand ( contradicted by evidence in the report itself ) that Ms. Abedin refund the Department ’ s alleged overpayment , ” he wrote .
“ Further , while it is undisputed that Ms. Abedin worked during her periods of leave — and indeed that she was known as a workaholic who rarely took vacation — absolutely no effort was made to calculate the amount of time Ms. Abedin worked during the periods in question and whether her work hours amounted to at least eight hours a day . Any State Department employee — indeed any government employee — deserves better , and so does Ms. Abedin , ” Mr. Rodriguez wrote .
The FBI was first alerted that the IG was conducting a “ criminal investigation ” of Ms. Abedin in a memo dated Oct. 22 , 2013 , the records show .
After 15 months of extensive document-gathering and interviews , the IG submitted the case for review by the Justice Department public integrity division , which declined to prosecute Ms. Abedin . The “ alleged violations ” cited were improperly requesting and approving annual leave and “ embezzlement , ” the documents state .
“ The case was not declined based on the merits of the investigation , ” stated the final investigative report , dated Jan. 26 .
Such a designation usually means federal prosecutors decided not to pursue a case , but only because they didn ’ t think it worth the resources , not because the facts and evidence couldn ’ t support a case .
The designation opened the door for the department to seek reimbursement of $ 10,674.32 in payments that investigators concluded Ms. Abedin was not entitled to receive , the documents show .
Investigators concluded that while they could not prove Ms. Abedin had intended to defraud the government , “ the investigation substantiated that Abedin , on several occasions , failed to submit a Request for Leave or Approved Absence . ”
The failure left her with paid leave that should have been expended during her vacation and maternity , inflating her final payout when she left government .
In her interview , Ms. Abedin offered several explanations , stressing repeatedly she always worked during her vacations and maternity leave .
She said she left it to a “ timekeeper ” in the department to fill out her forms for her when she was a full-time employee and believed she had the proper permission to take her maternity leave . She also claimed that , after the fact , she had been told the department had simply decided not to charge her for her maternity leave because she often worked during that time .
Investigators found some email evidence that a special arrangement was discussed to possibly let Ms. Abedin avoid claiming leave time for her maternity but no evidence it was ever formalized .
“ Abedin was unable to say who made the determination to credit her hours . She also was unable to provide an accounting of the hours she worked while on maternity leave , ” investigators wrote in their final report .
The investigators also interviewed a co-worker who clearly recalled telling Ms. Abedin she needed to fill out formal paperwork to claim maternity leave , a document that was never located .
Investigators concluded the missing paperwork allowed Ms. Abedin , among other things , to be paid eight hours by taxpayers on the day she actually delivered her son , the documents show .
In her interview with investigators last fall , Ms. Abedin acknowledged she personally filled out her time sheets when she returned to the department after maternity leave and came back as a contractor working out of New York , known in federal parlance as a “ special government employee . ”

In interviews with Ms. Abedin ’ s colleagues , the inspector general agreed that handwritten time sheets governing her work as a contractor were in fact filled out by Ms. Abedin in summer 2012 .
Those time sheets claimed both improper overtime and excessive work hours not allowed under her SGE contract , the reports show .

“ When asked if she was aware SGEs did not receive overtime , ” the report states , the employee told investigators she had been instructed to “ keep track of Abedin ’ s hours in the same manner as when she was ” a regular full-time employee and could receive overtime .

The probe also gathered evidence she filed time sheets charging the government for impermissible overtime and excessive hours after she converted from a full-time federal employee to a State Department contractor.

Those timecards were filed during a period that remains under investigation over questions about possible conflicts of interest, documents gathered by the State Department inspector general show.

Ms. Abedin, who served as a deputy chief of staff to Mrs. Clinton from 2009 to late 2012, told investigators she hadn’t noticed she had received a $33,000 lump sum payment — about a third of which investigators determined was improper — when she left the State Department.

She suggested her husband, the disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner, failed to let her know.

“My husband handles all the finances in our household,” she told investigators during a recorded interview in October 2014.

She said she only learned of the payment after being contacted by investigators two years after her departure. “I did ask my husband to look up our bank statements, and we did have a deposit,” she said during her interview.

She also acknowledged it was likely she did not fill out the required form when she went on a two-week vacation to Europe in 2011 while she was pregnant — a trip she called a “Babymoon” in emails and her interview.

The failure to file the form resulted in her having excessive vacation time cashed out to her in the lump payment upon leaving government, investigators concluded.

“You are 100 percent right on the Babymoon. I don’t recall. One hundred percent right. I don’t recall filling out any paperwork saying I was taking leave,” she told the investigators. “I’m not even going to blame it on my pregnancy brain.”

The State Department’s inspector general formally concluded that Ms. Abedin failed to correctly submit multiple required time sheet and leave forms covering her vacation and maternity leave, resulting in an overpayment of $10,674.32 that she wasn’t entitled to receive when she left her job.

The Abedin investigation’s existence has been known for weeks, but the contents and findings have never been publicly released.

Sen. Chuck Grassley, Iowa Republican and chairman of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, has repeatedly questioned Ms. Abedin’s compensation and work arrangements under Mrs. Clinton, suggesting she was overpaid and may have engaged in conflicts of interest when she worked both for State as a contractor and a firm in New York connected to friends of the Clinton family.

Charges of smear job

Ms. Abedin’s lawyer, Miguel Rodriguez, has accused the senator of a smear job in suggesting there was any criminality.

The documents provided to The Times by a source outside the Senate or the IG’s office make clear, however, the inquiry was clearly criminal in nature and ultimately referred to federal prosecutors.

Mr. Rodriguez did not immediately return a call seeking comment from The Times on Wednesday.

However, he sent a letter to the OIG disputing its conclusions, saying investigators should have credited Ms. Abedin for the time she worked while off rather than demand she repay the money.

“I am deeply troubled by gaps in the OIG’s investigation, holes in its methodology, unsupported allegations, as well as its conclusory demand (contradicted by evidence in the report itself) that Ms. Abedin refund the Department’s alleged overpayment,” he wrote.

“Further, while it is undisputed that Ms. Abedin worked during her periods of leave — and indeed that she was known as a workaholic who rarely took vacation — absolutely no effort was made to calculate the amount of time Ms. Abedin worked during the periods in question and whether her work hours amounted to at least eight hours a day. Any State Department employee — indeed any government employee — deserves better, and so does Ms. Abedin,” Mr. Rodriguez wrote.

The FBI was first alerted that the IG was conducting a “criminal investigation” of Ms. Abedin in a memo dated Oct. 22, 2013, the records show.

After 15 months of extensive document-gathering and interviews, the IG submitted the case for review by the Justice Department public integrity division, which declined to prosecute Ms. Abedin. The “alleged violations” cited were improperly requesting and approving annual leave and “embezzlement,” the documents state.

“The case was not declined based on the merits of the investigation,” stated the final investigative report, dated Jan. 26.

Such a designation usually means federal prosecutors decided not to pursue a case, but only because they didn’t think it worth the resources, not because the facts and evidence couldn’t support a case.

The designation opened the door for the department to seek reimbursement of $10,674.32 in payments that investigators concluded Ms. Abedin was not entitled to receive, the documents show.

Investigators concluded that while they could not prove Ms. Abedin had intended to defraud the government, “the investigation substantiated that Abedin, on several occasions, failed to submit a Request for Leave or Approved Absence.”

The failure left her with paid leave that should have been expended during her vacation and maternity, inflating her final payout when she left government.

Reputation as workaholic

In her interview, Ms. Abedin offered several explanations, stressing repeatedly she always worked during her vacations and maternity leave.

She said she left it to a “timekeeper” in the department to fill out her forms for her when she was a full-time employee and believed she had the proper permission to take her maternity leave. She also claimed that, after the fact, she had been told the department had simply decided not to charge her for her maternity leave because she often worked during that time.

Investigators found some email evidence that a special arrangement was discussed to possibly let Ms. Abedin avoid claiming leave time for her maternity but no evidence it was ever formalized.

“Abedin was unable to say who made the determination to credit her hours. She also was unable to provide an accounting of the hours she worked while on maternity leave,” investigators wrote in their final report.

The investigators also interviewed a co-worker who clearly recalled telling Ms. Abedin she needed to fill out formal paperwork to claim maternity leave, a document that was never located.

Investigators concluded the missing paperwork allowed Ms. Abedin, among other things, to be paid eight hours by taxpayers on the day she actually delivered her son, the documents show.

(Over)time as a contractor

In her interview with investigators last fall, Ms. Abedin acknowledged she personally filled out her time sheets when she returned to the department after maternity leave and came back as a contractor working out of New York, known in federal parlance as a “special government employee.”

That admission could affect an ongoing investigation into Ms. Abedin’s simultaneous work in 2012 as both a special contractor at State and for a private firm in New York. Congress has asked the inspector general to investigate whether there were any conflicts of interest during that work.

In interviews with Ms. Abedin’s colleagues, the inspector general agreed that handwritten time sheets governing her work as a contractor were in fact filled out by Ms. Abedin in summer 2012.

Those time sheets claimed both improper overtime and excessive work hours not allowed under her SGE contract, the reports show.

Benghazi leaves questions about her legacy as top U.S. diplomat

What is the next chapter for Clinton?

The end of 2012 was set to be Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 's farewell tour as the top U.S. diplomat. But things clearly changed.

After logging more than 950,000 miles and visiting 112 countries over four years, she is known for keeping a grueling schedule.

President Barack Obama called her extraordinary at a recent diplomatic reception.

""Over the last four years, Hillary has been everywhere -- both in terms of her travels, which have seen her represent America in more countries than any previous secretary of state, and through her tireless work to restore our global leadership, "" Obama said.

Clinton enjoys something rarely seen anymore in politics -- a soaring approval rating. It was close to 70% in early December.

state_department,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/world/2018/3/13/16029526/rex-tillerson-fired-state-department,Rex Tillerson has been fired. Experts say he did damage that could last “a generation.”,2018-03-13,"Zack Beauchamp, Jen Kirby, Ezra Klein, Alissa Wilkinson, Sigal Samuel, Terry Nguyen, Rebecca Jennings","Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was fired by President Donald Trump , according to White House officials ’ statements on Tuesday morning .
He was in office for a little over a year , one of the shortest tenures in modern history — and it was not , experts say , a distinguished one .
“ Tillerson would be at or near the bottom of the list of secretaries of state , not just in the post-Second World War world but in the record of US secretaries of state , ” says Paul Musgrave , a scholar of US foreign policy at the University of Massachusetts Amherst .
The former Exxon Mobil CEO , whose nomination was initially greeted warmly by prominent foreign policy hands , will leave office without any major accomplishments . This is largely because he failed to wield any significant influence in internal administration debates over issues like North Korea or Russia , and in fact actively alienated the president during several key policy debates .
His push to slash “ inefficiencies ” in the State Department and seeming disinterest in working closely with longtime staff were even more damaging . Under Tillerson ’ s watch , 60 percent of State ’ s top-ranking career diplomats resigned and new applications to join the foreign service fell by half , according to a November count by the American Foreign Service Association .
This hollowing-out of the foreign service , combined with Tillerson ’ s inability to appoint people to vital positions like ambassador to South Korea , delayed American responses to major crises and weakened the State Department for a “ generation , ” according to George Washington University ’ s Elizabeth Saunders .
This can ’ t all be blamed on Tillerson : Even a skilled and experienced diplomat would have had trouble maintaining influence in the chaotic Trump White House , a place where foreign policy is often made over Twitter . As if to underscore the point , Trump announced Tillerson ’ s departure in a tweet — before the secretary himself could make a statement .
Yet scholars and foreign policy practitioners across the political spectrum agree that he deserves much of the blame .
`` I think he really will go down as one of the worst secretaries of State we 've had , '' Eliot Cohen , counselor to the State Department under President George W. Bush , told Axios ’ s Jonathan Swan . “ He will go down as the worst Secretary of State in history , ” tweeted Ilan Goldenberg , an Obama-era State Department official .
Many expected Tillerson to be one of the “ adults in the room , ” helping Secretary of Defense James Mattis rein in some of Trump ’ s wildest ideas . His attempts to play that role backfired — his ham-handed attempts to manage Trump alienated the president , who has reportedly complained about his “ totally establishment ” views on foreign policy .
When you combine the lack of influence over Trump with Tillerson ’ s dismantling of the State Department ’ s staff — he made more of a mess of the department in a shorter amount of time than any other secretary of state in history — you have a truly disastrous tenure in Foggy Bottom .
“ He took the job and made it smaller , ” Musgrave says .
Tillerson failed at the thing he was supposed to be good at
When Trump announced Tillerson as his pick for secretary of state , back in December 2016 , the foreign policy community was split on the appointment .
As CEO of Exxon Mobil , one of the world ’ s largest corporations , Tillerson seemed to be more than qualified to effectively manage a sprawling bureaucracy like the State Department . Mainstream GOP foreign policy experts like former Defense Secretary Robert Gates , former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , and former National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley all praised the pick .
`` He would bring to the position vast knowledge , experience , and success in dealing with dozens of governments and leaders in every corner of the world , ” Gates said in a statement . `` He is a person of great integrity whose only goal in office would be to protect and advance the interests of the United States . ”
Critics , though , worried about Tillerson ’ s close relationship with Vladimir Putin and Exxon ’ s willingness to strike deals with corrupt foreign dictators and history of lobbying against climate change ( though the corporation now says it accepts climate science ) . During his January confirmation hearings , senators grilled him about both Russia and climate change , with Democrats clearly unsatisfied by his answers .
`` Do you lack the knowledge to answer my question , or refuse to answer my question ? '' Sen. Tim Kaine ( D-VA ) puffed after Tillerson repeatedly stonewalled his questions about Exxon funding climate change denial . `` A little of both , ” Tillerson replied .
Tillerson was confirmed in late January 2017 nonetheless , in a vote that basically fell along party lines . Quickly , he set about upending everyone ’ s views about him . As soon as March , it had become clear that the conventional wisdom was 100 percent wrong . The fears about Tillerson ’ s policy views had proven overblown , mostly because he had been completely overshadowed in internal White House deliberations over issues like Syria and Russia .
“ More than a month after he became America ’ s top diplomat , Rex Tillerson is like no other modern secretary of State : he ’ s largely invisible , ” the LA Times ’ s Tracy Wilkinson reported at the time . “ His influence at the White House is difficult to discern . He appears to be competing with Jared Kushner , Trump ’ s son-in-law , and Stephen Bannon , the president ’ s chief strategist , both of whom have Trump ’ s ear on foreign policy . ”
The optimism about Tillerson ’ s management acumen , by contrast , had clearly been misplaced . Tillerson failed to place political appointees in a number of vital leadership positions , failed to spend a lot of time with his own employees , and pushed out longtime employees without clear replacements in mind . Morale inside the organization collapsed .
“ I used to love my job , ” one State Department staffer told the Atlantic ’ s Julia Ioffe at the time . “ Now , it feels like coming to the hospital to take care of a terminally ill family member . You come in every day , you bring flowers , you brush their hair , paint their nails , even though you know there ’ s no point . But you do it out of love . ”
What was true in March remained true for the rest of Tillerson ’ s brief tenure . On issue after issue , Tillerson proved to be out of touch with the president ’ s foreign policy positions .
The US bombed Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in early April — just days after Tillerson suggested the administration would be fine with Assad staying in power . On June 9 , Tillerson called on Saudi Arabia and its allies to end their isolation of Qatar ; less than two hours later , Trump sided with the Saudis by labeling Qatar “ a funder of terrorism at a very high level . ”
On July 20 , after a meeting in which the president reportedly asked for a major expansion of America ’ s nuclear arsenal , Tillerson told aides that the president was a moron — or , according to some reports , a “ fucking moron. ” One time , Tillerson tried to open the door to negotiations with North Korea — and Trump slapped him down in a tweet .
The staffing problem at the State Department remained bad throughout Tillerson ’ s tenure and in some ways got even worse . Only 64 out of 153 political appointees were confirmed by the Senate , according to a count by the Washington Post and Partnership for Public Service . He had not nominated anyone to be the assistant secretary supervising vital regions like Asia and the Middle East , nor did he nominate ambassadors for countries as important as Saudi Arabia and South Korea .
Political appointees are necessary to shape policy , as they serve as a conduit between the administration and foreign governments . Without people in these positions , career diplomats fill in as best as they can , but they have a hard time making new decisions or formulating new policy . It ’ s near unprecedented to go this long with this many vacancies , because it cripples America ’ s ability to develop diplomatic stances on vital issues .
“ When I was assistant secretary , I was sworn in early April [ of the first year ] , ” says Hank Cohen , the assistant secretary of state for Africa under George H.W . Bush . Under Tillerson , this position has still not officially been filled . “ It ’ s a big problem , ” Cohen said .
In addition to that , it ’ s not like the past year has been uneventful . During Tillerson ’ s tenure , tensions over North Korea ’ s nuclear program got so bad that war started to seem like a real possibility — and then President Trump decided to sit down with Kim Jong Un for the first direct negotiations ever between Washington and Pyongyang . One US ally in the Gulf ( Saudi Arabia ) laid economic siege to another ( Qatar ) . Russia apparently poisoned a double agent on British soil .
And even the career staff suffered under Tillerson . He eliminated entire segments of the department , like the department that tracked war crimes . He imposed limits on transfers inside the organization , typically a way the State Department deals with staffing shortages , in late June .
He publicly defended a Trump administration proposal to cut his department ’ s budget by 30 percent and has repeatedly pushed for staffing cuts despite repeated rebukes from Congress . He also cut off the department from vital recruiting sources , like the Presidential Management Fellows program .
“ Secretary Tillerson ’ s term has led to widespread demoralization in the foreign service , the dismissal or resignation of people with expertise that individually may not be irreplaceable but as a cohort certainly becomes so , ” Musgrave says . “ That hinders the State Department ’ s ability to enhance US interests through diplomacy . ”
The State Department ’ s personnel shortfalls have long-term effects on everything ranging from the South China Sea to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict — you can ’ t negotiate very well if you don ’ t have people who know how to do it . Saunders analogizes the US under Tillerson ’ s emaciated State Department to a person who doesn ’ t have health insurance . “ Your life is probably fine — up until the point you get sick , ” she says .
The source of Tillerson ’ s failures is both Trump and his own choices
Some of the blame has to be laid at his boss ’ s feet . Trump is running a chaotic administration that has nominated a shockingly low number of political appointees across practically every department . The White House shot down so many of Tillerson ’ s picks for top deputies that he actually screamed at a group of White House aides during a meeting .
Trump personally displayed little to no interest in learning from the expertise of State Department personnel , preferring instead to push his pet priorities like weakening the Iran deal and withdrawing from the Paris climate accord .
“ It may be that in a Trump administration , the structural realities of the way the White House works , you can only choose among varieties of failure , ” Musgrave says .
But that excuse only goes so far . Defense Secretary Mattis hasn ’ t been immune to Trump ’ s bizarre management style — he was blindsided , most notably , by Trump ’ s proposal to ban transgender people from serving in the military — but on the whole , he has been far more effective at advocating for his department ’ s interests and gaining influence over the president ’ s decision-making .
You could say this is because Trump has more respect for generals than diplomats , and that ’ s partially true . Mattis also seems better at handling Trump ’ s mercurial nature ; according to the New York Times , Tillerson frequently annoyed the president in meetings by ( among other things ) saying , “ It ’ s your deal , ” whenever Trump overruled him .
But a third and vital part of it , experts say , is that Mattis — a career military professional and former general — is substantially better at working in Washington . In particular , Mattis understood that working closely with his staff in the Pentagon allowed him to advance policy ideas through the bureaucracy .
“ Mattis is drawing on the expertise of his building . Some of that is a product of [ his own ] experience , ” Saunders says . “ Tillerson is not a creature of his building , nor is he a creature of government at all . ”
By most accounts , Tillerson failed to build relationships with people in Foggy Bottom , relying instead on an insular inner circle made up of a few longtime confidants . This decision “ constitutes the core of his failure , ” according to Musgrave : It made it hard for Tillerson to garner influence inside the White House and to understand what his staff could do and how to deploy them effectively .
“ Tillerson had a half-dozen , maybe a dozen aides who are not familiar with Washington and especially not familiar with the State Department , ” Musgrave says . “ But he seems to rely on these people who are loyal to him , known to him , at the expense of building relationships with the people in the building . ”
Perhaps if Tillerson had developed closer relationships with State ’ s career staff , he would have understood that supporting budget cuts to his own department and downsizing staff would demoralize them . Perhaps he would have been able to develop new ideas that would have gotten the president ’ s ear . Perhaps he would have been more able to convince the White House to trust his judgment on political appointees .
Perhaps , perhaps , perhaps . But the truth is we won ’ t know because Tillerson , to a degree nearly unprecedented in State ’ s history , failed to even try to work with his own department .
All of which invites the question : Why did this multimillionaire leave his cushy job at the head of one of the world ’ s largest corporations and then take a job at a government bureaucracy he didn ’ t understand and seemingly didn ’ t respect ?
It ’ s a question only Tillerson can answer . And right now , it doesn ’ t seem like he ’ s in the mood for a lot of talking .","Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was fired by President Donald Trump, according to White House officials’ statements on Tuesday morning.

He was in office for a little over a year, one of the shortest tenures in modern history — and it was not, experts say, a distinguished one.

“Tillerson would be at or near the bottom of the list of secretaries of state, not just in the post-Second World War world but in the record of US secretaries of state,” says Paul Musgrave, a scholar of US foreign policy at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

The former Exxon Mobil CEO, whose nomination was initially greeted warmly by prominent foreign policy hands, will leave office without any major accomplishments. This is largely because he failed to wield any significant influence in internal administration debates over issues like North Korea or Russia, and in fact actively alienated the president during several key policy debates.

His push to slash “inefficiencies” in the State Department and seeming disinterest in working closely with longtime staff were even more damaging. Under Tillerson’s watch, 60 percent of State’s top-ranking career diplomats resigned and new applications to join the foreign service fell by half, according to a November count by the American Foreign Service Association.

This hollowing-out of the foreign service, combined with Tillerson’s inability to appoint people to vital positions like ambassador to South Korea, delayed American responses to major crises and weakened the State Department for a “generation,” according to George Washington University’s Elizabeth Saunders.

This can’t all be blamed on Tillerson: Even a skilled and experienced diplomat would have had trouble maintaining influence in the chaotic Trump White House, a place where foreign policy is often made over Twitter. As if to underscore the point, Trump announced Tillerson’s departure in a tweet — before the secretary himself could make a statement.

Yet scholars and foreign policy practitioners across the political spectrum agree that he deserves much of the blame.

""I think he really will go down as one of the worst secretaries of State we've had,"" Eliot Cohen, counselor to the State Department under President George W. Bush, told Axios’s Jonathan Swan. “He will go down as the worst Secretary of State in history,” tweeted Ilan Goldenberg, an Obama-era State Department official.

Many expected Tillerson to be one of the “adults in the room,” helping Secretary of Defense James Mattis rein in some of Trump’s wildest ideas. His attempts to play that role backfired — his ham-handed attempts to manage Trump alienated the president, who has reportedly complained about his “totally establishment” views on foreign policy.

When you combine the lack of influence over Trump with Tillerson’s dismantling of the State Department’s staff — he made more of a mess of the department in a shorter amount of time than any other secretary of state in history — you have a truly disastrous tenure in Foggy Bottom.

“He took the job and made it smaller,” Musgrave says.

Tillerson failed at the thing he was supposed to be good at

When Trump announced Tillerson as his pick for secretary of state, back in December 2016, the foreign policy community was split on the appointment.

As CEO of Exxon Mobil, one of the world’s largest corporations, Tillerson seemed to be more than qualified to effectively manage a sprawling bureaucracy like the State Department. Mainstream GOP foreign policy experts like former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and former National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley all praised the pick.

""He would bring to the position vast knowledge, experience, and success in dealing with dozens of governments and leaders in every corner of the world,” Gates said in a statement. ""He is a person of great integrity whose only goal in office would be to protect and advance the interests of the United States.”

Critics, though, worried about Tillerson’s close relationship with Vladimir Putin and Exxon’s willingness to strike deals with corrupt foreign dictators and history of lobbying against climate change (though the corporation now says it accepts climate science). During his January confirmation hearings, senators grilled him about both Russia and climate change, with Democrats clearly unsatisfied by his answers.

""Do you lack the knowledge to answer my question, or refuse to answer my question?"" Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) puffed after Tillerson repeatedly stonewalled his questions about Exxon funding climate change denial. ""A little of both,” Tillerson replied.

Tillerson was confirmed in late January 2017 nonetheless, in a vote that basically fell along party lines. Quickly, he set about upending everyone’s views about him. As soon as March, it had become clear that the conventional wisdom was 100 percent wrong. The fears about Tillerson’s policy views had proven overblown, mostly because he had been completely overshadowed in internal White House deliberations over issues like Syria and Russia.

“More than a month after he became America’s top diplomat, Rex Tillerson is like no other modern secretary of State: he’s largely invisible,” the LA Times’s Tracy Wilkinson reported at the time. “His influence at the White House is difficult to discern. He appears to be competing with Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, and Stephen Bannon, the president’s chief strategist, both of whom have Trump’s ear on foreign policy.”

The optimism about Tillerson’s management acumen, by contrast, had clearly been misplaced. Tillerson failed to place political appointees in a number of vital leadership positions, failed to spend a lot of time with his own employees, and pushed out longtime employees without clear replacements in mind. Morale inside the organization collapsed.

Mr. Sullivan sent at least 59 messages to Mrs. Clinton that are now marked with some level of classified redaction .
One of those dealt with the fallout from the 2010 parliament elections in Afghanistan , in which many of President Hamid Karzai ’ s favored candidates lost .
In a message sent the morning of Nov. 25 , 2010 , the day after election , he forwarded information from U.S. Special Envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan Richard Holbrooke , who was passing on information and analysis provided by Afghan activist and State Department adviser Rina Amiri about challenges to the vote results .
A large portion of her communique was redacted as classified foreign relations or activity .
Another email that Mr. Sullivan forwarded to Mrs. Clinton was a readout from a conversation between the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Johnnie Carson and Ghanaian President John Atta Mills about tense negotiation over a major deal between Exxon Mobil and Kosmos Energy in Ghana .
The Aug. 12 , 2010 , email was sent a week before the $ 4 billion deal for the U.S. company to access Ghana ’ s oil fields blew up .
“ Madam Secretary : I spoke to President John Atta Mills for about fifteen minutes on Thursday evening , August 12 , ” wrote Mr. Carson . The rest of the message was redacted , with the markings indicating it contained confidential foreign government information and U.S. foreign relations activities that needed to remain secret .

Mr. Sullivan is scheduled to testify behind closed doors to the congressional committee probing the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attack , which among its other duties has taken a lead role in pushing for disclosure of Mrs. Clinton ’ s emails .

Ms. Mills testified to the committee Thursday , and afterwards the top Democrat on the panel , Rep. Elijah E. Cummings , demanded Republicans release the full transcript . He said she answered all questions and dispelled “ wild Republican allegations . ”
“ Unfortunately , it appears that the Select Committee has shelved its core work on Benghazi to focus almost exclusively on Secretary Clinton and her aides in an effort to attack her bid for president , ” said Mr. Cummings , Maryland Democrat .
Indeed , Mrs. Clinton ’ s email arrangement has become the dominant issue for the Democratic presidential front-runner , and has dented her standing in the polls .
When she took office as secretary , she rejected use of a state.gov email account and a State Department-issued Blackberry or iPad , instead using her own devices and setting up an account for herself on a server she kept at her home in New York . She said it was more convenient to use a single account for personal messages and government business .
But she didn ’ t turn over the government records upon leaving office , only sending them back — in paper form — late last year . She initially said she never sent classified information from the server , but has since clarified that she never sent information officially deemed classified at the time .
After the State Department began releasing the emails in response to a court order , internal watchdogs warned there was classified information being made public .
That sparked a shake-up , and now five separate intelligence agencies have a role in vetting the emails and determining if anything needs to be redacted as classified .

“Unfortunately, it appears that the Select Committee has shelved its core work on Benghazi to focus almost exclusively on Secretary Clinton and her aides in an effort to attack her bid for president,” said Mr. Cummings, Maryland Democrat.

Indeed, Mrs. Clinton’s email arrangement has become the dominant issue for the Democratic presidential front-runner, and has dented her standing in the polls.

When she took office as secretary, she rejected use of a state.gov email account and a State Department-issued Blackberry or iPad, instead using her own devices and setting up an account for herself on a server she kept at her home in New York. She said it was more convenient to use a single account for personal messages and government business.

But she didn’t turn over the government records upon leaving office, only sending them back — in paper form — late last year. She initially said she never sent classified information from the server, but has since clarified that she never sent information officially deemed classified at the time.

After the State Department began releasing the emails in response to a court order, internal watchdogs warned there was classified information being made public.

That sparked a shake-up, and now five separate intelligence agencies have a role in vetting the emails and determining if anything needs to be redacted as classified.

The State Department has not indicated what actions, if any, Mrs. Clinton’s top aides took regarding the classification of information they handled via email.

The Trump administration has blocked Gordon Sondland, President Trump's ambassador to the European Union, from testifying before Congress on Tuesday.

Sondland has been a key figure in the widening Ukraine scandal involving the president, members of his Cabinet and high-ranking diplomats.

""Early this morning, the U.S. Department of State directed Ambassador Gordon Sondland not to appear today for his scheduled transcribed interview before the U.S. House of Representatives Joint Committee,"" the law firm representing Sondland said in a statement. ""Ambassador Sondland had previously agreed to appear voluntarily today, without the need for a subpoena, in order to answer the Committee's questions on an expedited basis. As the sitting U.S. Ambassador to the EU and employee of the State Department, Ambassador Sondland is required to follow the Department's direction.""

He added, ""We will consider this act today ... to be further acts of obstruction of a co-equal branch of government.""

Sondland, a Trump donor rewarded with a plum ambassadorship, has become embroiled in the Ukraine controversy after text messages emerged showing Sondland and other high-ranking diplomatic officials discussing Ukraine, military aid to that country and investigations of the 2016 election.

ABC News reported this weekend that the Colorado company that helped run her server said there may be a full backup server , which might have many of the messages she said she deleted .
In the new court filing , the State Department said it is getting back on schedule for publicly releasing the Clinton emails after falling more than 1,000 pages behind in July , when the need to screen messages for secret information overwhelmed the department .
Now , the screening process is running smoothly , with five security agencies involved in the review . They have been through 20 percent of Mrs. Clinton ’ s messages , the department said .

The nearly 100-page report concludes that the State Department ’ s internal review board -- called the Accountability Review Board , or ARB -- was flawed . The report by Republicans on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee alleges the board ’ s probe was not comprehensive , its interviews were not thorough , and the investigation itself may have been damaged by conflicts of interest .
A central finding is that the department , as a result of the board ’ s findings , meted out discipline to four mid-level officials ( who were later re-instated anyway ) , but the board glossed over the actions and decisions of senior-level officials . The report claims the internal review identified many of the security problems with the Benghazi compound , while ignoring who was behind the policy decisions that led to them .
Specifically , the report points to the authorization by Under Secretary for Management Patrick Kennedy to continue operating the ad hoc compound in Benghazi . The interim report found that a December 2011 action memo , prepared by Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Jeffrey Feltman and signed off on by Kennedy , green-lighted the operation . Witnesses told Republican investigators that this decision to run the operation on an ad hoc basis was largely responsible for the inadequate security presence on the ground in Benghazi , not money .
The report also noted that it ’ s unclear which other senior leaders were involved in this decision but said it is likely , based on email evidence , that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ’ s views played a role in the decision-making .
None of the four State Department employees who were disciplined after the ARB was released in December , and later re-instated by Secretary of State John Kerry in August , were responsible for making policy .

The House oversight committee has hearings scheduled for Sept. 19 .","The State Department review of the Benghazi terror attack let senior officials off the hook for the policy decisions that led to sub-standard security at the U.S. compound in eastern Libya, according to a draft House committee report obtained by Fox News.

The nearly 100-page report concludes that the State Department’s internal review board -- called the Accountability Review Board, or ARB -- was flawed. The report by Republicans on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee alleges the board’s probe was not comprehensive, its interviews were not thorough, and the investigation itself may have been damaged by conflicts of interest.

A central finding is that the department, as a result of the board’s findings, meted out discipline to four mid-level officials (who were later re-instated anyway), but the board glossed over the actions and decisions of senior-level officials. The report claims the internal review identified many of the security problems with the Benghazi compound, while ignoring who was behind the policy decisions that led to them.

Specifically, the report points to the authorization by Under Secretary for Management Patrick Kennedy to continue operating the ad hoc compound in Benghazi. The interim report found that a December 2011 action memo, prepared by Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Jeffrey Feltman and signed off on by Kennedy, green-lighted the operation. Witnesses told Republican investigators that this decision to run the operation on an ad hoc basis was largely responsible for the inadequate security presence on the ground in Benghazi, not money.

The report also noted that it’s unclear which other senior leaders were involved in this decision but said it is likely, based on email evidence, that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s views played a role in the decision-making.

More On This...

None of the four State Department employees who were disciplined after the ARB was released in December, and later re-instated by Secretary of State John Kerry in August, were responsible for making policy. The draft states that the use of administrative leave was meant to leave the impression of accountability.

A review of congressional testimony and internal State Department memos by Fox News in June found that the policy decision to maintain a presence in Benghazi with substandard security was made at the most senior levels of the State Department by officials who have so far escaped blame -- including Feltman, Kennedy and Clinton.

The draft interim report, which was produced by the Republican majority, states clearly that Clinton wanted to extend the Benghazi operation. It reported that several officials within the Near Eastern Affairs office recalled Clinton's desire to leave the operation in place once the primary diplomatic facility in Tripoli was re-opened.

In the summer of 2012, as security conditions unraveled, with documented attacks on western facilities, a State Department officer who served on the Libya desk said Kennedy was asked about the mission's future, and Kennedy said he would first have to check with Clinton. Based on a conversation between Ambassador Chris Stevens – who was later killed in the attack -- and Clinton, Stevens’ deputy Greg Hicks testified it was the former secretary of State's personal goal to have a permanent operation in Benghazi.

State Department Assistant Secretary of State Douglas Frantz said Sunday that the ARB's and State Department's response to Benghazi has been ""thorough and transparent.""

""In fact, it set a new standard for transparency measured by tens of thousands of pages of documents turned over to Congress, testimony in public and closed hearings and a declassified report for the public,"" he said. ""To suggest anything has been hidden or that accountability has been averted requires willful ignorance of these facts.""

“Twisting the facts to advance a political agenda does a disservice to those who lost their lives and those who have devoted the past year to understanding what happened and implementing security procedures to make certain it does not happen again,"" Frantz added. ""The ARB report did not find that any individual willfully ignored his or her responsibilities or engaged in misconduct; it did not find that anyone breached his or her duty so as to be subject to termination or other discipline. It did, however, identify leadership deficiencies on the part of four employees""

Rep. Elijah Cummings, the committee’s top Democrat, in a written statement called the report's claims ""unsubstantiated accusations.""

“This Republican report is not an official Committee report, but rather a completely partisan staff report that the Chairman apparently did not want Committee Members to see before he leaked it to the press. Rather than focusing on the reforms recommended by the ARB, Republicans have politicized the investigation by engaging in a systematic effort to launch unsubstantiated accusations against the Pentagon, the State Department, the President, and now the ARB itself,"" he said.

But the draft report said that there were other problems with the internal review.

As one example, the co-chairman of the ARB Ambassador Thomas Pickering told investigators that his team had the authority to conduct depositions, and the authority to issue subpoenas. But the Board never used these authorities, instead relying heavily on group and individual interviews.

While the ARB placed blamed on the State Department Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs for ""systemic leadership and management deficiencies,"" the NEA's second in command was only interviewed once, in a group setting. Adm. Mike Mullen, the other co-chairman of the ARB, was asked by congressional investigators why the second in command was not more thoroughly questioned, and according to the draft, Mullen said the official did not seem to bear significant responsibility.

The draft interim report also concluded that the State Department's unwillingness to provide the working documents from the ARB made an independent assessment by the congressional committee difficult. Rather than record or transcribe interviews, the ARB relied on summaries. Mullen said he found the summaries to be accurate.

Mullen subsequently described, however, an example of how a culture of collegiality could undermine the ARB’s independence. Mullen put Cheryl Mills on notice that Deputy Assistant Secretary for International Programs Charlene Lamb’s interview with the Board could be “difficult” for the State Department.

(On Sep. 18, the Republican staff issued a clarification to its report that Mullen put Cheryl Mills on notice, saying that Deputy Assistant Secretary for International Programs Charlene Lamb’s interview could be difficult, not Ms. Mills' questioning.)

The interim report states that members of the House oversight committee, led by Republican Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., will sharpen its focus on the senior State Department officials who drove the policy decisions in Benghazi.

The failure to affix blame above the assistant secretary level could impact future decisions on ""expeditionary diplomacy"" where diplomats are now operating in areas they would have pulled out of a decade ago. Critics have accused the Obama administration of favoring a light footprint which does not reflect the security conditions on the ground.

The draft interim findings will be released early next week. The House oversight committee has hearings scheduled for Sept. 19.

The Libyan dictator provided regular reports to the CIA that helped capture or kill key al Qaeda figures and thwart terrorist attacks against American targets overseas , those sources said .
The Libyan regime , for instance , helped U.S. forces kill a key al Qaeda operative of a suicide attack on a U.S. air field in Afghanistan in 2007 when Vice President Dick Cheney was visiting .
It also helped foil a plan to attack the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria in 2005 , according to U.S. intelligence sources who spoke to The ███ on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media .
“ The Gadhafi regime was a productive source for counterterrorism intelligence , ” said a former senior intelligence official who was personally familiar with the information-sharing arrangement the U.S. had with Libya . “ The relationship was healthy enough that even Mousa Koussa [ the head of Libyan intelligence from 1994 to 2009 ] visited the CIA during the [ George W. ] Bush administration years . ”
The American officials ’ accounts were corroborated by former Gadhafi aide Mohammed Ismael , who told The Times that his former boss authorized significant intelligence-sharing with the U.S. during the war on terrorism , especially relating to al Qaeda ’ s expansion into North Africa .
SEE ALSO : Hillary Clinton ’ s ‘ WMD ’ moment : U.S. intelligence saw false narrative in Libya
Mr. Ismael said the former Libyan regime was instrumental in the targeting of Abu Laith al-Libi , then the No . 3 leader of al Qaeda and the suspected mastermind of a 2007 Bagram Air Field bombing in Afghanistan that killed 23 people and injured 20 . In that incident , a suicide bomber reached the outer gate of the U.S. installation while the vice president was visiting .
Mr. Ismael described the attack as an “ assassination attempt ” against Mr. Cheney , a theory that was debated in U.S. military circles . He said that when al-Libi was killed several months later in Pakistan by a CIA Predator drone , it was Libyan intelligence that helped U.S. forces find him .
“ Libya was the first country in the world to issue an international arrest warrant for Osama bin Laden in March 1988 , ” Mr. Ismael told The Times in a series of email exchanges .
“ Intelligence sharing and information provided to U.S. intelligence agencies led the U.S. to their first arrest of [ al-Libi ] , and Libyan intelligence services provided their U.S. counterpart with valuable information on Libyan terrorists in Iraq and hard-core fighters from Derna , Libya , in Iraq , ” he said .
Mr. Ismael broke his silence to the press last month for the first time since the fall of the Gadhafi regime when he spoke to The Times about Mrs. Clinton ’ s role in pushing the 2011 NATO intervention in Libya that ousted Gadhafi from power .
The Times reported that the Pentagon opposed military intervention so much that it sent an emissary to negotiate with Libya , bypassing Mrs. Clinton , in conversations that were captured on tape . U.S. intelligence couldn ’ t corroborate Mrs. Clinton ’ s primary argument for war , that Libya was in imminent danger of a humanitarian crisis , the paper reported .
In September 2011 , The New York Times reported that documents found in an abandoned Libyan spymaster ’ s office “ provide new details of the close relations the Central Intelligence Agency shared with the [ Gadhafi ] Libyan intelligence services . ”
It said the U.S. apparently sent terrorism suspects at least eight times for questioning to Libya .
Mr. Ismael told The Times that his former bosses helped lead the CIA to Ibrahim Suleiman Adnan Adam Harun — commonly known as “ Spin Ghul ” — a battle-hardened al Qaeda veteran who was extradited to New York from Italy in 2013 and held on six federal charges including conspiracy to kill American military personnel and conspiracy to bomb diplomatic buildings .
One of those buildings , Mr. Ismael said , was the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria targeted in 2005 . While Gadhafi tried to help the U.S. thwart terrorist attacks , he said , the rebels unleashed by the removal of the Libyan leader led to an attack that killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stephens and three other Americans at Benghazi in September 2012 .
“ So you have the [ Gadhafi ] regime , which helped stop an attack on the U.S. Embassy , and you have the Libyan supported rebels that planned an attack on the U.S. Embassy . It ’ s ironic , ” he wrote to The Times .
Mr. Ismael also expressed frustration that after years of helping U.S. intelligence halt al Qaeda operations against its overseas military installations and embassies , the U.S. agency armed al-Qaeda-linked rebels in his own country , leading to the death of Gadhafi and the collapse of his regime .
“ You can see that al Qaeda was specifically linked to the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group , which [ NATO ] backed in the war against the regime , ” Mr. Ismael noted by email .
The Times this month revealed a classified weapons list compiled by Gadhafi intelligence agents that detailed armaments supplied to rebel forces by NATO member states .
The Libyan Islamic Fighting Group was one of the most powerful anti-Gadhafi rebel forces that allied itself with NATO in 2011 . Shortly before the intervention started in March , the Islamic organization adopted a secular , pro-democracy sounding name , calling itself the “ Libyan Fighting Group for Change . ”
Mr. Ismael said the former Libyan regime also helped shield Western nationals from terrorist dangers .
“ Libyan intelligence services played a major role with U.S. assistance in the arrest of Abd Razzaq al-Bara , a top al Qaeda leader in the Sahel region who was responsible for the abduction of more than 30 Western tourists in the Sahara desert , ” he wrote .
“ He was arrested with assistance of Libyans by a Chadian rebel group . The Libyans then stepped in and convinced the group to hand him over to Libya , which in turn turned him over to Algeria , ” Mr. Ismael said .
“ Al-Bara had plans to target U.S. interests in the region , ” he said .
Senior U.S. intelligence officials corroborated most of Mr. Ismael ’ s claims , confirming that Libya was a key cooperator from 2004 through 2011 with the CIA and that intelligence-gathering in the country became more difficult in the chaos that ensued with Gadhafi ’ s ouster .
“ My understanding and belief is that they were helpful after they dismantled their WMD program , ” said another U.S. intelligence source . “ They became pretty helpful to us because there were so many Libyans in al Qaeda and they had a unique window into that . ”","Hillary Rodham Clinton’s 2011 campaign to drive Moammar Gadhafi from power did significant damage to U.S. intelligence, according to a top Libyan aide and U.S. intelligence officials.

U.S. District Court Judge Amit Mehta ruled Tuesday that the State Department had not done all it could to locate the emails Clinton sent in relation to the Sept. 11 , 2012 , attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi Libya that killed four Americans — including Ambassador Christopher Stevens .
He found that the State Department “ has not met its burden of establishing it performed an adequate search ” in response to Judicial Watch ’ s Freedom of Information Act request .
Politico reports that the State Department has so far located 348 Benghazi-related messages , sent to or from Clinton in the months around the attack . However , Judge Mehta said that that wasn ’ t enough . Instead , he ordered the State Department to search the state.gov email archives of the accounts of former aides Huma Abedin , Cheryl Mills , and Jacob Sullivan .
“ If Secretary Clinton sent an e-mail about Benghazi to Abedin , Mills , or Sullivan at his or her state.gov e-mail address , or if one of them sent an e-mail to Secretary Clinton using his or her state.gov account , then State ’ s server presumably would have captured and stored such an e-mail , ” he said in the ruling . “ Therefore , State has an obligation to search its own server for responsive records . ”
The ruling is in response to a suit filed by Judicial Watch originally in 2015 . The conservative watchdog has been central in the quest to get more information about Clinton ’ s emails , specifically in relation to the Benghazi attack .
“ This major court ruling may finally result in more answers about the Benghazi scandal – and Hillary Clinton ’ s involvement in it – as we approach the attack ’ s fifth anniversary , ” Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said in a statement .
Fitton also questioned why the conservative watchdog had to fight not only the Obama administration but also the Trump administration on the search for the emails :
“ Why are Secretary Tillerson and Attorney General Sessions wasting taxpayer dollars protecting Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration ? ” he asked .

Mccarthy, Carrie Severino, Tobias Hoonhout, Rich Lowry","He will be a good secretary of state , and he could be a monumental one .
John Kerry was an extremely successful secretary of state in one important sense : He served his president faithfully , and faithfully imposed his president ’ s policies on the State Department .
As for the rest , Kerry ends his career a perfect symbol of Obama ’ s foreign policy ( talk a lot , and carry a small stick ) and of the disastrous mess Obama is leaving behind : allies doubtful , enemies emboldened , Russia resurgent , China hostile , terrorist safe havens from one end of the Muslim world to the other , the worst global refugee crisis since World War II , the Middle East in flames , the terrorist empire of Iran all but assured of nuclear weapons and regional hegemony – and this could just be the prelude to much worse on the horizon .
If ever we needed a truly monumental secretary of state , that time is now . The last time America had a truly monumental secretary of state was when James A. Baker III served in that role in the Bush 41 administration , building the Gulf War coalition while presiding over the peaceful liquidation of the Soviet empire . The secretary of state Baker most admired was Henry Kissinger , an even more monumental secretary of state , who held that position in the 1970s , extricating the U.S. from Vietnam while laying the foundations for peace between Israel and Egypt and for America ’ s preeminent position in the Middle East , which lasted until Obama started throwing it away . In the last century , the only other secretary of state who deserves placement in that company is Dean Acheson , Harry Truman ’ s secretary of state , who negotiated the pillars of America ’ s eventual victory in the Cold War : NATO , the Pacific alliances , Bretton Woods , the World Bank , and the IMF .
I call these men “ monumental ” not just because of the dramatic , positive changes they brought to America ’ s position in the global order , but also because their style of diplomacy carried with it all the weight of America ’ s moral and material power . They were candid advisers of unquestioned loyalty to their presidents ; they had a strategic vision for advancing American interests in a tumultuous world ; they had the practical sense to steer the State Department along the required course , in stages ; they chose their words on America ’ s behalf carefully , in full appreciation of the fact that words have ( or should have ) serious consequences when they come from the secretary of state ; and they were able negotiators , inured to leverage and hard bargaining .
These are the qualities a secretary of state needs to be successful . Excellence in each of them makes for a monumental secretary of state . In his confirmation hearing this week , Rex Tillerson , President-elect Trump ’ s nominee to the post , showed great promise in all of them .
Tillerson did not have an easy eight hours before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee . Several senators expressed concerns about his positions on Russia , Iran sanctions , and climate change , and his potential conflicts of interest . Owing to Trump ’ s favorable comments on Vladimir Putin , and Tillerson ’ s own direct dealings with the Russian government as head of Exxon , the most serious concern seemed to be Russia , followed closely by Exxon ’ s reported lobbying against Iran sanctions . Senators were also looking for daylight between Tillerson ’ s position and Trump ’ s , as often happens with nominees who weren ’ t previously close to their new boss .
Though a few senators seemed to remain unconvinced , even those on the fence would admit that Tillerson is upstanding , thoughtful , and serious enough to represent the United States . Senator John Cornyn ( R. , Tex . ) introduced Tillerson as an “ inspired choice ” for secretary of state , and nothing has come to light that would lead one to think otherwise .
The nominee who emerged in the hearings was someone with a clear instinct for speaking softly , and seldom , and carrying a big stick . As he said in his opening statement : “ To achieve the stability that is foundational to peace and security in the 21st century , American leadership must not only be renewed , it must be asserted . ”
Tillerson ran into a buzzsaw in the form of Senator Marco Rubio ( R. , Fla. ) . Rubio asked Tillerson whether he would support legislation imposing mandatory sanctions on people responsible for cyberattacks against the United States . Tillerson objected that a mandatory-sanctions package “ leaves the executive branch no latitude or flexibility in dealing with the broad array of cyber threats . I think it is important those be dealt with on a country-by-country basis , taking all other elements into consideration in the relationship . So giving the executive the tool is one thing . Requiring the executive to use it without any other considerations , I would have concerns about. ” Rubio then asked whether Tillerson would support canceling the recent Obama executive order imposing sanctions on Russians responsible for the DNC hack . Tillerson answered that the new administration would have to do a comprehensive review of cyber strategy .
There are several points in Tillerson ’ s favor here : First , while the Congress has broad powers to regulate foreign policy , the execution of foreign policy — including the timing and precise targeting of sanctions — is clearly the president ’ s prerogative . Second , the problem of attribution is quite complicated , especially in the case of Russia , which uses hordes of informal hacker militias . Also , what makes cyberattacks difficult to respond to is that they often boil down to fairly straightforward cases of the very same espionage that the U.S. conducts continuously against friend and foe alike , and which we have long openly claimed the right to conduct .
Regardless , Rubio characterized Tillerson ’ s answer as “ troubling ” and then dialed up the pressure . “ Do you think Vladimir Putin is a war criminal ? ” he asked . “ I wouldn ’ t use that term , ” Tillerson replied . Rubio pounced . He described Russia ’ s recent indiscriminate bombing in Aleppo , as well as Russia ’ s earlier war against Chechnya , in which he said 300,000 civilians died , when Putin was prime minister . “ Based on this information and what ’ s publicly in the record , ” Rubio asked , “ you ’ re not prepared to say Vladimir Putin and his military violated the rules of war and conducted war crimes ? ” Tillerson answered , “ Those are very , very serious charges to make and I would want to have much more information before reaching a conclusion . ”
On Russia , Tillerson said what he needed to say . ‘ We are not likely to ever be friends , because our value systems are so different . ’
Rubio didn ’ t let up . “ Mr . Tillerson , do you believe that Vladimir Putin and his cronies are responsible for ordering the murder of countless dissidents , journalists , and political opponents ? ” Tillerson answered as before , that he didn ’ t have sufficient information to make such a claim and didn ’ t want to reach a conclusion only on the basis of unclassified information . “ None of this is classified , ” Rubio shot back , “ these people are dead. ” Tillerson finally seemed annoyed : “ Your question was people who were directly responsible for that . I ’ m not disputing these people are dead . ”
Senator Robert Menendez ( D. , N.J. ) continued in a similar vein to Rubio ’ s , saying it was “ amazing ” that Tillerson and Trump had yet to discuss the issue of Russia . Senator Bob Corker ( R. , Tenn. ) intervened to relieve the pressure . If you were shown sufficient classified and other evidence that these atrocities took place , Corker essentially asked , would you consider them war crimes ? “ Yes , sir , ” answered Tillerson .
Someone might have also pointed out that there is a difference between asking a nominee to describe how he sees a problem or a strategy , and asking a nominee to take a public position on a sensitive issue that he may not be able to walk back once in office , before he has had a chance to deliberate with colleagues and allies . The former is a proper subject for a committee hearing . The latter , on the other hand , is something that should only come out of full deliberation within the government , and is arguably inappropriate in a confirmation hearing . It ’ s like asking a Supreme Court nominee which way he will rule in a case that will be before him in a few weeks , based on a one-sided capsule summary . For a sitting secretary of state to label Saudi Arabia a human-rights violator or accuse Russia of war crimes may be entirely justified , and even a moral imperative , but it also risks a rupture in relations , with potentially damaging consequences for vital American interests , including that of human rights . It would be irresponsible for a nominee to take such a position without appropriate deliberation .
On Russia , Tillerson said what he needed to say . “ We are not likely to ever be friends , because our value systems are so different. ” He made clear that aggressive moves by Russia require proportionate responses , to send the message that Russian aggression won ’ t be tolerated .
Exxon ’ s business operations in Russia and Iran also led senators to question whether the new secretary might not be too soft on human-rights violators and state sponsors of terrorism . Of particular concern were indications that Exxon had lobbied against sanctions on Russia and Iran . On Russia sanctions , Tillerson explained that , to his knowledge , Exxon had only expressed concerns that sanctions were being structured in a way that would put American companies at a disadvantage to European ones . More troubling for senators was Tillerson ’ s claim that “ to my knowledge , Exxon never directly lobbied against sanctions ” against Iran . According to lobbying disclosure forms , Exxon lobbied on the Iran Sanctions Enabling Act of 2009 and the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions , Accountability , and Divestment Act of 2010 ( CISADA ) , the most powerful of all the Iran sanctions . Exxon maintains that it “ provided information of the impact of the sanctions , but did not lobby against the sanctions , ” but Senator Menendez responded that Exxon would not have needed to report such activity as lobbying .
The issue might linger until it is unambiguously cleared up , and Exxon should be as forthcoming as possible . Meantime , it bears recalling that a company as large as Exxon has far-flung lobbying activities , and routinely lobbies on issues large and small , all around the world and at every level of government . Senior management often engages in strategic lobbying against major legislation , but sometimes lobbying on legislation – even significant legislation like Iran sanctions – is done on the initiative of lower-level department heads without the knowledge of senior management .
A lot of controversy surrounds Exxon on the subject of climate change . For many environmentalists , Exxon is like the Death Star in Star Wars . One of the most egregious and troubling examples of climate-alarmist persecution against climate realists is related to Exxon ’ s internal documents showing risks of warming from manmade carbon dioxide . Despite environmentalists ’ charges , Exxon ’ s public position has been carefully qualified , going so far as to admit the risks of manmade climate change .
Tillerson was pressed on this by several senators . He explained : “ I came to my personal position over about 20 years as an engineer and scientist , and understanding the evolution of the science . And I came to the conclusion a few years ago that the risk of climate change does exist , and that the consequences of it could be serious enough that action should be taken . The type of action seems to be where the largest areas of debate exist in the public discourse. ” Pressed for further clarification by Senator Corker , Tillerson said , “ The increase in the greenhouse-gas concentrations in the atmosphere [ is ] having an effect . Our ability to predict that effect is very limited . ”
It is virtually impossible to improve on this answer . It concedes to the climate alarmists the major propositions that seem justified , namely that climate change is a concern , and that human activity is having some impact on it . It also puts uncertainty where the alarmists have utterly failed ( though they refuse to admit it ) to establish sufficient certainty for a conclusive policy analysis : whether the risk is clear enough to compel any particular action today , given scientists ’ extremely limited ability to quantify the relationship between CO2 increases and temperature increases precisely enough to support an informed choice among policy alternatives .
Should the U.S. remain engaged in international climate talks ? Tillerson didn ’ t hesitate : “ The U.S. should have a seat at the table , because the problem of climate change requires a global response. ” It should also have a seat at the table to ensure that international negotiations on climate change receive periodic injections of reality and reason , if only to temper against needlessly counterproductive policies . Here again , Tillerson said the right thing : “ I am an engineer by training . I seek to understand the facts , follow where they lead , and apply logic to our international affairs . ”
Tillerson ’ s explanation of Russia ’ s increasingly aggressive projections of power abroad was illuminating : “ It was in the absence of American leadership that this door was left open and unintended signals were sent . We backtracked on commitments we made to allies . We sent weak or mixed signals with ‘ red lines ’ that turned into green lights. ” A subsequent exchange with Senator Ben Cardin ( D. , Md . ) made clear Tillerson ’ s intuitive sense of deterrence and how to manage the balance of power , something that has been woefully missing in American strategy and diplomacy for far too long .
TILLERSON : I think the real question was the taking of Crimea which led to actions by Russia which i mentioned . The next action being coming across the border of eastern Ukraine with both military assets and men . That was the next illegal action . I think the absence of a firm and forceful response to the taking of Crimea was judged by the leadership in Russia as a weak response .
CARDIN : What would you have done after we were surprised by what they did in taking over Crimea , what should the U.S. leadership have done in response to — TILLERSON : I would have recommended that the Ukraine take all of its military assets available , put them on the eastern border , provide assets with defensive weapons that are necessary just to defend themselves , announce that the U.S. is going to provide them intelligence and that either NATO or U.S. will provide air surveillance over the border to monitor movements . CARDIN : Your recommendation is a more robust supply of military ? TILLERSON : Yes , sir . I think what Russian leadership would have understood is a powerful response that indicated , yes , you took Crimea , but this stops here . . . . That ’ s the type of response Russia expects . If Russia acts with force – the taking of Crimea was an act of force . . . . So it required a proportional show of force to indicate to Russia that there will be no more taking of territory .
The exchange demonstrates a willingness to counter Russian aggression with American power . Tillerson ’ s use of the phrase “ proportional show of force ” shows an intuitive sense that stability depends on maintaining and protecting the balance of power through the application of negotiating leverage . History has not tired of demonstrating that pacifism is no way to keep the peace , and that diplomacy does not consist principally in talking . The often-heard assertion that force should be only a last resort , to be used only when diplomacy fails , is utterly false . That way of thinking often guarantees that diplomacy will fail , as we saw with Obama ’ s surrender to Iran ’ s nuclear-weapons program . For diplomacy to be successful , national power , including military power , has to work hand in hand with negotiations , from beginning to end .
International negotiation is hard . You have to be able to consider carefully the pros and cons of various courses of action on the basis of rational cost-benefit analysis , while creating value by understanding the true needs of people from totally different cultures , all in the context of multidimensional multilateral negotiations that are sometimes just tacit . That is a skill you can almost never learn in the course of public service , which is why a long career in public service is not the best preparation to be secretary of state , as you can clearly see when you compare the performance of John Kerry with that of James Baker and Dean Acheson . Kerry spent his life in the Senate , while both Baker and Acheson were accomplished business attorneys for many years before entering public service . Tillerson will be one of the most accomplished secretaries of state that the private sector has ever produced .
As an engineer and a businessman , rather than a lawyer , Tillerson lacks the exquisite precision of a James Baker . That ’ s an argument for filling the traditional position of “ counselor to the secretary of state ” with a lawyer in the Baker mold , someone who can help Tillerson craft public statements and positions with due regard to the multitude of considerations and audiences that are affected by the State Department ’ s pronouncements . What matters is that Tillerson is a man of few words , who knows that words matter and that words have consequences .
This was evident in what was perhaps Tillerson ’ s strongest moment in the hearings , namely his second exchange with Senator Rubio . Rubio pressed him to characterize Saudi Arabia as a human-rights violator , citing among other things the ban on women driving . Tillerson shot back :
In terms of , when you designate someone or label someone , the question is , is that the most effective way to have progress continue to be made in Saudi Arabia ? Or any other country ? So my interest is the same as yours . Our interests are not different , Senator . There seems to be some misunderstanding that somehow I see the world through a different lens . And I do not . I share all of the same values that you share and want the same things for people the world over in terms of freedoms . But I ’ m also clear-eyed and realistic about dealing in cultures . These are centuries-long cultures , of cultural differences . It doesn ’ t mean we can ’ t affect them and affect them to change . Over many years I ’ ve been traveling to the kingdom ; while the pace is slow , slower than any of us wish , there is a change under way in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia . How and if they ever arrive to the same value system we have , I can ’ t predict that . However , it is moving in the direction we want it to move . What I wouldn ’ t want it to do is take precipitous action that suddenly causes the leadership in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia to have to interrupt that . I would like for them to continue to make that progress .
The exchange between Rubio and Tillerson was encouraging for another reason : It was a revival of a longstanding debate about American foreign policy entirely within the conservative-internationalist camp , to which both Rubio and Tillerson belong . The debate , in fine , is this : Admitting the importance of a globally engaged foreign policy and a willingness to project American power for the cause of both vital American interests and human rights , what is the right balance between realism and idealism ? Henry Kissinger ’ s whole career can be thought of as a meditation on that question , though he is usually thought of ( usually incorrectly ) as a callous realist . Likewise Dean Acheson and James Baker : Their penchant for tactical realism made them extremely effective secretaries , but often obscured the idealism of their long-range strategies .
# related # The fact that we ’ re having this debate within the GOP camp is good news in and of itself . For one thing , it represents the marginalization of the callous and dangerous isolationism of Senator Rand Paul ( R. , Ky. ) .

It also represents an uplifting contrast with the moral cowardice of the Obama administration , that moral cowardice that is a peculiar province of intellectuals , which believes itself evenhanded in treating allies and enemies alike , and which retreats from the exercise of American power because it believes that power itself is bad .

He will be a good secretary of state, and he could be a monumental one.

John Kerry was an extremely successful secretary of state in one important sense: He served his president faithfully, and faithfully imposed his president’s policies on the State Department.

As for the rest, Kerry ends his career a perfect symbol of Obama’s foreign policy (talk a lot, and carry a small stick) and of the disastrous mess Obama is leaving behind: allies doubtful, enemies emboldened, Russia resurgent, China hostile, terrorist safe havens from one end of the Muslim world to the other, the worst global refugee crisis since World War II, the Middle East in flames, the terrorist empire of Iran all but assured of nuclear weapons and regional hegemony – and this could just be the prelude to much worse on the horizon.

If ever we needed a truly monumental secretary of state, that time is now. The last time America had a truly monumental secretary of state was when James A. Baker III served in that role in the Bush 41 administration, building the Gulf War coalition while presiding over the peaceful liquidation of the Soviet empire. The secretary of state Baker most admired was Henry Kissinger, an even more monumental secretary of state, who held that position in the 1970s, extricating the U.S. from Vietnam while laying the foundations for peace between Israel and Egypt and for America’s preeminent position in the Middle East, which lasted until Obama started throwing it away. In the last century, the only other secretary of state who deserves placement in that company is Dean Acheson, Harry Truman’s secretary of state, who negotiated the pillars of America’s eventual victory in the Cold War: NATO, the Pacific alliances, Bretton Woods, the World Bank, and the IMF.

I call these men “monumental” not just because of the dramatic, positive changes they brought to America’s position in the global order, but also because their style of diplomacy carried with it all the weight of America’s moral and material power. They were candid advisers of unquestioned loyalty to their presidents; they had a strategic vision for advancing American interests in a tumultuous world; they had the practical sense to steer the State Department along the required course, in stages; they chose their words on America’s behalf carefully, in full appreciation of the fact that words have (or should have) serious consequences when they come from the secretary of state; and they were able negotiators, inured to leverage and hard bargaining.

These are the qualities a secretary of state needs to be successful. Excellence in each of them makes for a monumental secretary of state. In his confirmation hearing this week, Rex Tillerson, President-elect Trump’s nominee to the post, showed great promise in all of them.

Tillerson did not have an easy eight hours before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Several senators expressed concerns about his positions on Russia, Iran sanctions, and climate change, and his potential conflicts of interest. Owing to Trump’s favorable comments on Vladimir Putin, and Tillerson’s own direct dealings with the Russian government as head of Exxon, the most serious concern seemed to be Russia, followed closely by Exxon’s reported lobbying against Iran sanctions. Senators were also looking for daylight between Tillerson’s position and Trump’s, as often happens with nominees who weren’t previously close to their new boss.

Though a few senators seemed to remain unconvinced, even those on the fence would admit that Tillerson is upstanding, thoughtful, and serious enough to represent the United States. Senator John Cornyn (R., Tex.) introduced Tillerson as an “inspired choice” for secretary of state, and nothing has come to light that would lead one to think otherwise.

The nominee who emerged in the hearings was someone with a clear instinct for speaking softly, and seldom, and carrying a big stick. As he said in his opening statement: “To achieve the stability that is foundational to peace and security in the 21st century, American leadership must not only be renewed, it must be asserted.”

RUSSIA

Tillerson ran into a buzzsaw in the form of Senator Marco Rubio (R., Fla.). Rubio asked Tillerson whether he would support legislation imposing mandatory sanctions on people responsible for cyberattacks against the United States. Tillerson objected that a mandatory-sanctions package “leaves the executive branch no latitude or flexibility in dealing with the broad array of cyber threats. I think it is important those be dealt with on a country-by-country basis, taking all other elements into consideration in the relationship. So giving the executive the tool is one thing. Requiring the executive to use it without any other considerations, I would have concerns about.” Rubio then asked whether Tillerson would support canceling the recent Obama executive order imposing sanctions on Russians responsible for the DNC hack. Tillerson answered that the new administration would have to do a comprehensive review of cyber strategy.

There are several points in Tillerson’s favor here: First, while the Congress has broad powers to regulate foreign policy, the execution of foreign policy — including the timing and precise targeting of sanctions — is clearly the president’s prerogative. Second, the problem of attribution is quite complicated, especially in the case of Russia, which uses hordes of informal hacker militias. Also, what makes cyberattacks difficult to respond to is that they often boil down to fairly straightforward cases of the very same espionage that the U.S. conducts continuously against friend and foe alike, and which we have long openly claimed the right to conduct.

Regardless, Rubio characterized Tillerson’s answer as “troubling” and then dialed up the pressure. “Do you think Vladimir Putin is a war criminal?” he asked. “I wouldn’t use that term,” Tillerson replied. Rubio pounced. He described Russia’s recent indiscriminate bombing in Aleppo, as well as Russia’s earlier war against Chechnya, in which he said 300,000 civilians died, when Putin was prime minister. “Based on this information and what’s publicly in the record,” Rubio asked, “you’re not prepared to say Vladimir Putin and his military violated the rules of war and conducted war crimes?” Tillerson answered, “Those are very, very serious charges to make and I would want to have much more information before reaching a conclusion.”

On Russia, Tillerson said what he needed to say. ‘We are not likely to ever be friends, because our value systems are so different.’

Rubio didn’t let up. “Mr. Tillerson, do you believe that Vladimir Putin and his cronies are responsible for ordering the murder of countless dissidents, journalists, and political opponents?” Tillerson answered as before, that he didn’t have sufficient information to make such a claim and didn’t want to reach a conclusion only on the basis of unclassified information. “None of this is classified,” Rubio shot back, “these people are dead.” Tillerson finally seemed annoyed: “Your question was people who were directly responsible for that. I’m not disputing these people are dead.”

Senator Robert Menendez (D., N.J.) continued in a similar vein to Rubio’s, saying it was “amazing” that Tillerson and Trump had yet to discuss the issue of Russia. Senator Bob Corker (R., Tenn.) intervened to relieve the pressure. If you were shown sufficient classified and other evidence that these atrocities took place, Corker essentially asked, would you consider them war crimes? “Yes, sir,” answered Tillerson.

Someone might have also pointed out that there is a difference between asking a nominee to describe how he sees a problem or a strategy, and asking a nominee to take a public position on a sensitive issue that he may not be able to walk back once in office, before he has had a chance to deliberate with colleagues and allies. The former is a proper subject for a committee hearing. The latter, on the other hand, is something that should only come out of full deliberation within the government, and is arguably inappropriate in a confirmation hearing.

EXXON, RUSSIA, AND IRAN

Exxon’s business operations in Russia and Iran also led senators to question whether the new secretary might not be too soft on human-rights violators and state sponsors of terrorism. Of particular concern were indications that Exxon had lobbied against sanctions on Russia and Iran. On Russia sanctions, Tillerson explained that, to his knowledge, Exxon had only expressed concerns that sanctions were being structured in a way that would put American companies at a disadvantage to European ones. More troubling for senators was Tillerson’s claim that “to my knowledge, Exxon never directly lobbied against sanctions” against Iran.

Exxon maintains that it “provided information of the impact of the sanctions, but did not lobby against the sanctions,” but Senator Menendez responded that Exxon would not have needed to report such activity as lobbying.

The issue might linger until it is unambiguously cleared up, and Exxon should be as forthcoming as possible.

Senior management often engages in strategic lobbying against major legislation, but sometimes lobbying on legislation – even significant legislation like Iran sanctions – is done on the initiative of lower-level department heads without the knowledge of senior management.

CLIMATE CHANGE

A lot of controversy surrounds Exxon on the subject of climate change. For many environmentalists, Exxon is like the Death Star in Star Wars. One of the most egregious and troubling examples of climate-alarmist persecution against climate realists is related to Exxon’s internal documents showing risks of warming from manmade carbon dioxide. Despite environmentalists’ charges, Exxon’s public position has been carefully qualified, going so far as to admit the risks of manmade climate change.

Tillerson was pressed on this by several senators. He explained: “I came to my personal position over about 20 years as an engineer and scientist, and understanding the evolution of the science.

Our ability to predict that effect is very limited.”

It is virtually impossible to improve on this answer. It concedes to the climate alarmists the major propositions that seem justified, namely that climate change is a concern, and that human activity is having some impact on it. It also puts uncertainty where the alarmists have utterly failed (though they refuse to admit it) to establish sufficient certainty for a conclusive policy analysis: whether the risk is clear enough to compel any particular action today, given scientists’ extremely limited ability to quantify the relationship between CO2 increases and temperature increases precisely enough to support an informed choice among policy alternatives.

Here again, Tillerson said the right thing: “I am an engineer by training. I seek to understand the facts, follow where they lead, and apply logic to our international affairs.”

A BALANCE-OF-POWER SECRETARY

Tillerson’s explanation of Russia’s increasingly aggressive projections of power abroad was illuminating: “It was in the absence of American leadership that this door was left open and unintended signals were sent. We backtracked on commitments we made to allies. We sent weak or mixed signals with ‘red lines’ that turned into green lights.” A subsequent exchange with Senator Ben Cardin (D., Md.) made clear Tillerson’s intuitive sense of deterrence and how to manage the balance of power, something that has been woefully missing in American strategy and diplomacy for far too long.

TILLERSON: I think the real question was the taking of Crimea which led to actions by Russia which i mentioned. The next action being coming across the border of eastern Ukraine with both military assets and men. That was the next illegal action. I think the absence of a firm and forceful response to the taking of Crimea was judged by the leadership in Russia as a weak response.

If Russia acts with force – the taking of Crimea was an act of force. . . . So it required a proportional show of force to indicate to Russia that there will be no more taking of territory.

The exchange demonstrates a willingness to counter Russian aggression with American power. Tillerson’s use of the phrase “proportional show of force” shows an intuitive sense that stability depends on maintaining and protecting the balance of power through the application of negotiating leverage. History has not tired of demonstrating that pacifism is no way to keep the peace, and that diplomacy does not consist principally in talking. The often-heard assertion that force should be only a last resort, to be used only when diplomacy fails, is utterly false. That way of thinking often guarantees that diplomacy will fail, as we saw with Obama’s surrender to Iran’s nuclear-weapons program. For diplomacy to be successful, national power, including military power, has to work hand in hand with negotiations, from beginning to end.

PROJECTING POWER FOR GOOD

International negotiation is hard. You have to be able to consider carefully the pros and cons of various courses of action on the basis of rational cost-benefit analysis, while creating value by understanding the true needs of people from totally different cultures, all in the context of multidimensional multilateral negotiations that are sometimes just tacit. That is a skill you can almost never learn in the course of public service, which is why a long career in public service is not the best preparation to be secretary of state, as you can clearly see when you compare the performance of John Kerry with that of James Baker and Dean Acheson.

That’s an argument for filling the traditional position of “counselor to the secretary of state” with a lawyer in the Baker mold, someone who can help Tillerson craft public statements and positions with due regard to the multitude of considerations and audiences that are affected by the State Department’s pronouncements. What matters is that Tillerson is a man of few words, who knows that words matter and that words have consequences.

This was evident in what was perhaps Tillerson’s strongest moment in the hearings, namely his second exchange with Senator Rubio. Rubio pressed him to characterize Saudi Arabia as a human-rights violator, citing among other things the ban on women driving. Tillerson shot back:

These are centuries-long cultures, of cultural differences. It doesn’t mean we can’t affect them and affect them to change.

How and if they ever arrive to the same value system we have, I can’t predict that. However, it is moving in the direction we want it to move. What I wouldn’t want it to do is take precipitous action that suddenly causes the leadership in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia to have to interrupt that.

Sessions,2017-03-03,Neil Munro,"President Barack Obama ’ s Department of State sponsored the July event in Ohio where Sen. Jeff Sessions met the Russian ambassador for the second time in 2016 , according to the organizers of the event .
The July 20 meeting in Cleveland was used by the Washington Post ’ s March 1 headline to double the number of meetings where Sessions met with Russians in 2016 . “ Sessions met with Russian envoy twice last year , encounters he later did not disclose , ” said the headline , which has created a mini-scandal as Democratic partisans push for Sessions ’ resignation from his post as the nation ’ s Attorney General , amid Democratic claims that the Russian government helped Donald Trump win the 2016 election .
The two-day event was hosted by a civic organization , Global Cleveland , whose website cites the state department ’ s role :
The July 19 activities were covered by Cleveland.com , which quotes one of the organizers saying “ We are working very closely with the State Department and the RNC to make sure folks coming to Cleveland are filled in with everything they need to know about , including that Cleveland is awesome . ”
The revelation of the State Department ’ s role in arranging Sessions ’ brief meeting with the Russian ambassador comes as news reports sketch out a large effort by deputies working for outgoing President Barack Obama to track and disseminate information about Donald Trump and his deputies .
The Washington Post article used the Ohio event to justify its front-page claim that Sessions held “ meetings ” with the Russian ambassador , Sergei Kisylak . According to the article ’ s lede :
Then-Sen. Jeff Sessions ( R-Ala. ) spoke twice last year with Russia ’ s ambassador to the United States , Justice Department officials said , encounters he did not disclose when asked about possible contacts between members of President Trump ’ s campaign and representatives of Moscow during Sessions ’ s confirmation hearing to become attorney general… The previously undisclosed discussions could fuel new congressional calls for the appointment of a special counsel to investigate Russia ’ s alleged role in the 2016 presidential election .
But the Washington Post only briefly described the Ohio meeting in the 32nd and 33rd paragraphs of the story , saying :
Two months before the September meeting , Sessions attended a Heritage Foundation event in July on the sidelines of the Republican National Convention that was attended by about 50 ambassadors . When the event was over , a small group of ambassadors approached Sessions as he was leaving the podium , and Kislyak was among them , the Justice Department official said . Sessions then spoke individually to some of the ambassadors , including Kislyak , the official said . In the informal exchanges , the ambassadors expressed appreciation for his remarks and some of them invited him to events they were sponsoring , said the official , citing a former Sessions staffer who was at the event .
Sessions said he also met the Russian ambassador in September , with two of his senior staff . The meeting became “ testy ” when the subject of Ukraine was broached , he said at a March 2 press conference .","President Barack Obama’s Department of State sponsored the July event in Ohio where Sen. Jeff Sessions met the Russian ambassador for the second time in 2016, according to the organizers of the event.

The July 20 meeting in Cleveland was used by the Washington Post’s March 1 headline to double the number of meetings where Sessions met with Russians in 2016. “Sessions met with Russian envoy twice last year, encounters he later did not disclose,” said the headline, which has created a mini-scandal as Democratic partisans push for Sessions’ resignation from his post as the nation’s Attorney General, amid Democratic claims that the Russian government helped Donald Trump win the 2016 election.

The two-day event was hosted by a civic organization, Global Cleveland, whose website cites the state department’s role:

On Tuesday, July 19, Global Cleveland welcomed roughly 80 international ambassadors to its Global Partners in Diplomacy reception at Severance Hall. The event, coordinated in partnership with the 2016 Republican National Convention and the U.S. Department of State, introduced the ambassadors to nearly 200 of Northeast Ohio’s civic and corporate leaders. …. The [first] evening’s keynote speaker, U.S. Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, stressed the importance of understanding what “having people of different backgrounds and origins means to your community.” … Click here to see pictures from the event: https://www.facebook.com/GlobalCleveland/photos/?tab=album&album_id=1105759579497225

The July 19 activities were covered by Cleveland.com, which quotes one of the organizers saying “We are working very closely with the State Department and the RNC to make sure folks coming to Cleveland are filled in with everything they need to know about, including that Cleveland is awesome.”

The revelation of the State Department’s role in arranging Sessions’ brief meeting with the Russian ambassador comes as news reports sketch out a large effort by deputies working for outgoing President Barack Obama to track and disseminate information about Donald Trump and his deputies.

Sanger,"But the American ambassador to the United Nations , Nikki R. Haley , suggested that such a process was doomed as long as Mr. Assad was in power . “ We know there ’ s not any sort of option where a political solution is going to happen with Assad at the head of the regime , ” she said on CNN . “ If you look at his actions , if you look at the situation , it ’ s going to be hard to see a government that ’ s peaceful and stable with Assad . ”
That statement stood in contrast not only to Mr. Tillerson ’ s comments but also to Ms. Haley ’ s own remarks a week ago — before Mr. Assad carried out his latest chemical weapons attack on civilians — in which she insisted that his departure from office was not a diplomatic priority for the United States .
Still , the overall tone of suspicion and condemnation of Russia ’ s actions in Syria indicated that Mr. Trump ’ s top national security advisers were nudging him back to a more traditional Russia policy . During his days as the chief executive of Exxon Mobil , Mr. Tillerson received a friendship award from Mr. Putin , and he is aware of the suspicions surrounding those ties and has gone the furthest in the administration in separating himself from the Russian leader .
The challenges have only multiplied in recent days . The Russians , angry about the attack on the air base , have threatened to cut off a communication line that the American and Russian militaries have used to notify each other about air operations in Syria . And the attack has forced Mr. Putin into a tighter relationship with Mr. Assad , perhaps tighter than the Russian leader wants .
Ms. Haley , who , like Mr. Tillerson , is new to diplomacy , has also apparently concluded that a hard line toward Russia is the safest course . The contrast between her remarks and Mr. Trump ’ s warm words for Mr. Putin on the campaign trail — as well as his refusal to acknowledge Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election — has been striking .
The Trump administration ’ s Syria policy has been difficult to parse . Mr. Tillerson , in his first television appearances since taking office , seemed to describe two different strategic objectives : halting chemical attacks and ultimately negotiating a cease-fire . But he made it clear that he had no intention of backing a military intervention that would overthrow Mr. Assad . That suggested that as long as the dictator used conventional means to kill his own people — barrel bombs instead of sarin gas — the United States would keep its distance .
“ I think what the United States and our allies want to do is to enable the Syrian people to make that determination ” about Mr. Assad ’ s fate , Mr. Tillerson said on CBS ’ s “ Face the Nation ” — a line that was often used by his predecessor in the Obama administration , John Kerry . “ You know , we ’ ve seen what violent regime change looks like in Libya and the kind of chaos that can be unleashed . ”","But the American ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R.

Human Rights Council declined to specifically address the pastor ’ s case during a meeting on Iran ’ s human rights record .
Rep. Frank Wolf , R-Va. , chairman of the Capitol Hill commission holding the hearing , slammed the Obama administration for turning down the invitation to testify .
“ It is amazing , ” Wolf told FoxNews.com . “ I can ’ t , almost , believe it . ”
The hearing , which began Friday morning , focuses on the plight of religious minorities in Iran . Slated to testify are the group representing the Abedini family in the U.S. as well as Abedini ’ s wife , Naghmeh .
The Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission reached out to the State Department last Friday in a bid to bring in a State Department witness to speak on the lead-off panel .
A Wolf aide said despite repeated attempts they didn ’ t hear back from the department until Thursday , when the department said no one was available .
Wolf voiced skepticism at the excuse . “ The building is loaded with people , ” he said of the State Department .
“ The very fact that the United States government is not speaking out sends a very powerful message , ” Wolf said .
Abedini converted from Islam to Christianity in 2000 and became a U.S. citizen in 2010 after he married his American wife . The Iranian government does not recognize his American citizenship , though it had enabled him to travel freely between both countries until this past summer , when he was pulled off a bus and placed under house arrest , according to his supporters .
The Obama administration has publicly called for Abedini ’ s release . But Naghmeh Abedini recently told Fox News that she has not received a phone call from President Obama or the secretary of state .
In prepared testimony for Friday ’ s hearing , she plans to say she is “ disappointed ” with the U.S. government .
“ I am disappointed that our president and our State Department have not fully engaged this case – disappointed that this great country is not doing more to free my husband , a U.S. citizen . We are both proud to be American citizens . And I expect more from our government , ” she plans to say .
Jay Sekulow , chief counsel at the American Center for Law and Justice which represents the family of the pastor , called the State Department ’ s decision not to attend “ extremely troubling and offensive to the many who face life-threatening abuse at the hands of the Iranian government . ”
“ The State Department 's decision to snub this commission can not be seen as anything less than a wanton disregard to stand up and speak out for those who can not , ” he said in a statement .
The hearing comes after the U.N. Human Rights Council held a meeting in Geneva on Monday that focused on Iran ’ s human rights record . At that meeting , the European Union delegation specifically called for the release of “ prisoners of conscience , ” including Abedini and others .
The U.S. representative , though , did not mention Abedini by name . Ambassador Eileen Chamberlain Donahoe instead broadly criticized “ the Iranian government ’ s ceaseless campaign of abuse ” against those who dissent .
“ We remind the government of Iran their obligation to allow individuals to exercise their rights to freedom of expression and association and to allow individuals and groups to maintain contact and cooperation with the mandates of this Council , ” she said .
She also called the findings of a new report by the Special Rapporteur “ serious ” and “ indicative of an ongoing and intensifying crackdown on human rights defenders and civil society actors . ”
The State Department , when asked why Donahoe did not herself raise the Abedini case , noted that the U.S. delegation focused on that report , “ which details the Iranian government ’ s ceaseless campaign of abuse against all who criticize or oppose it . ”
A State Department official also said that in Geneva , “ we made pointed reference to a number of our concerns regarding Iran , along with Syria , China , Cuba and North Korea . ”
The official said religious freedom is a “ top priority ” of the administration , and the “ White House and State Department have repeatedly and publicly called for Mr. Abedini ’ s release . ”
“ We continue to raise Mr. Abedini ’ s case with a variety of international actors to help raise awareness of his case and secure his release , ” the official said .
But Wolf said the decision “ not to even show up ” at Friday ’ s hearing betrays what he described as “ an inherent bias in the State Department against people of faith . ”
Wolf wanted to hear from Suzan Johnson Cook , ambassador-at-large for international religious freedom , or an official in the human rights division . He said he specifically wanted to ask the witness what is being done to secure Abedini ’ s release .
The Obama administration has addressed his case in the past , when questioned by the press .
State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said on March 7 that the administration is “ deeply concerned that the Iranians have not yet granted access to him by our Swiss protecting power ” and continues to believe “ he should be released immediately . ”
She has previously voiced concern about the fairness and transparency of his trial and claimed the administration is “ actively engaged ” in the case .
White House Press Secretary Jay Carney has said the same , and earlier this year he condemned “ Iran ’ s continued violation of the universal right of freedom or religion . ”
Abedini has been held in Iran ’ s brutal Evin prison since September of last year and was sentenced to eight years in prison in January – accused of evangelizing and threatening national security . The U.N. report said Abedini spent four weeks in solitary confinement and was subjected to tactics like sleep deprivation , after he was arrested in September . The report said he was then transferred to another ward where he was reportedly beaten and initially denied access to medical treatment .
His wife and their two children are in Idaho , though his wife traveled to Washington on Friday for the hearing .
Wolf said he can only assume the State Department ’ s message to Americans abroad is : “ Just don ’ t get arrested in a foreign country . ”","The State Department ducked a hearing Friday that will focus on the case of imprisoned American pastor Saeed Abedini, just days after the leading U.S. representative to the U.N.

A Wolf aide said despite repeated attempts they didn’t hear back from the department until Thursday, when the department said no one was available.

Wolf voiced skepticism at the excuse. “The building is loaded with people,” he said of the State Department.

“The very fact that the United States government is not speaking out sends a very powerful message,” Wolf said.

Abedini converted from Islam to Christianity in 2000 and became a U.S. citizen in 2010 after he married his American wife. The Iranian government does not recognize his American citizenship, though it had enabled him to travel freely between both countries until this past summer, when he was pulled off a bus and placed under house arrest, according to his supporters.

The Obama administration has publicly called for Abedini’s release. But Naghmeh Abedini recently told Fox News that she has not received a phone call from President Obama or the secretary of state.

In prepared testimony for Friday’s hearing, she plans to say she is “disappointed” with the U.S. government.

“I am disappointed that our president and our State Department have not fully engaged this case – disappointed that this great country is not doing more to free my husband, a U.S. citizen. We are both proud to be American citizens. And I expect more from our government,” she plans to say.

Jay Sekulow, chief counsel at the American Center for Law and Justice which represents the family of the pastor, called the State Department’s decision not to attend “extremely troubling and offensive to the many who face life-threatening abuse at the hands of the Iranian government.”

“The State Department's decision to snub this commission cannot be seen as anything less than a wanton disregard to stand up and speak out for those who cannot,” he said in a statement.

The hearing comes after the U.N. Human Rights Council held a meeting in Geneva on Monday that focused on Iran’s human rights record. At that meeting, the European Union delegation specifically called for the release of “prisoners of conscience,” including Abedini and others.

She also called the findings of a new report by the Special Rapporteur “serious” and “indicative of an ongoing and intensifying crackdown on human rights defenders and civil society actors.”

That report included a section on the Abedini case.

The State Department, when asked why Donahoe did not herself raise the Abedini case, noted that the U.S. delegation focused on that report, “which details the Iranian government’s ceaseless campaign of abuse against all who criticize or oppose it.”

A State Department official also said that in Geneva, “we made pointed reference to a number of our concerns regarding Iran, along with Syria, China, Cuba and North Korea.”

The official said religious freedom is a “top priority” of the administration, and the “White House and State Department have repeatedly and publicly called for Mr. Abedini’s release.”

“We continue to raise Mr. Abedini’s case with a variety of international actors to help raise awareness of his case and secure his release,” the official said.

But Wolf said the decision “not to even show up” at Friday’s hearing betrays what he described as “an inherent bias in the State Department against people of faith.”

Wolf wanted to hear from Suzan Johnson Cook, ambassador-at-large for international religious freedom, or an official in the human rights division. He said he specifically wanted to ask the witness what is being done to secure Abedini’s release.

The Obama administration has addressed his case in the past, when questioned by the press.

State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said on March 7 that the administration is “deeply concerned that the Iranians have not yet granted access to him by our Swiss protecting power” and continues to believe “he should be released immediately.”

She has previously voiced concern about the fairness and transparency of his trial and claimed the administration is “actively engaged” in the case.

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney has said the same, and earlier this year he condemned “Iran’s continued violation of the universal right of freedom or religion.”

Abedini has been held in Iran’s brutal Evin prison since September of last year and was sentenced to eight years in prison in January – accused of evangelizing and threatening national security. The U.N. report said Abedini spent four weeks in solitary confinement and was subjected to tactics like sleep deprivation, after he was arrested in September. The report said he was then transferred to another ward where he was reportedly beaten and initially denied access to medical treatment.

His wife and their two children are in Idaho, though his wife traveled to Washington on Friday for the hearing.

Wolf said he can only assume the State Department’s message to Americans abroad is: “Just don’t get arrested in a foreign country.”",www.foxnews.com,right,4A4gPPKfUkm6DiCP

Dear Hillary , A serious situation has arisen in Albania which needs urgent attention at senior levels of the US government . You may know that an opposition demonstration in Tirana on Friday resulted in the deaths of three people and the destruction of property . There are serious concerns about further unrest connected to a counter-demonstration to be organized by the governing party on Wednesday and a follow-up event by the opposition two days later to memorialize the victims . The prospect of tens of thousands of people entering the streets in an already inflamed political environment bodes ill for the return of public order and the country ’ s fragile democratic process . I believe two things need to be done urgently : 1 . Bring the full weight of the international community to bear on Prime Minister Berisha and opposition leader Edi Rama to forestall further public demonstrations and to tone down public pronouncements . 2 . Appoint a senior European official as a mediator . While I am concerned about the rhetoric being used by both sides , I am particularly worried about the actions of the Prime Minister . There is videotape of National Guard members firing on demonstrators from the roof of the Prime Ministry . The Prosecutor ( appointed by the Democratic Party ) has issued arrest warrants for the individuals in question . The Prime Minister had previously accused the opposition of intentionally murdering these activists as a provocation . After the tape came out deputies from his party accused the Prosecutor of planning a coup d ’ etat in collaboration with the opposition , a charge Mr. Berisha repeated today . No arrests have been made as of this writing . The demonstration resulted from opposition protests over the conduct of parliamentary elections in 2009 . The political environment has deteriorated ever since and is now approaching levels of 1997 , when similar issues caused the country to slide into anarchy and violence . There are signs that Edi Rama ’ s control of his own people is slipping , which may lead to further violence . The US and the EU must work in complete harmony over this , but given Albania ’ s European aspirations the EU must take the lead . That is why I suggest appointing a mediator such as Carl Bildt , Martti Ahtisaari or Miroslav Lajcak , all of whom have strong connections to the Balkans . My foundation in Tirana is monitoring the situation closely and can provide independent analysis of the crisis . Thank you , George Soros

The Boston Globe reported Friday that Kerry sat down twice with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif in recent months to strategize in a bid to save the deal , as part of what the Globe described as “ an aggressive yet stealthy ” mission to put pressure on the Trump administration to keep the deal in some form .
Trump faces a May 12 deadline to review the deal , and Kerry has been ramping up his meetings ahead of that deadline . He reportedly met with German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier -- who was foreign minister of Germany when the deal was negotiated . He has also met with French President Emmanuel Macron twice and spoken by phone with European Union foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini .
The Globe reported that Kerry was quiet in his campaign as he believes that a high-profile defense of the deal by prominent Democrats would only make Trump more likely to pull the U.S. out of the deal .
Kerry ’ s reported actions immediately sparked criticism and raised claims that such dealings with Iranian and European officials could violate the Logan Act -- which prohibits private citizens from negotiating on behalf of the U.S. government without authorization
While no one has ever been successfully prosecuted under the law , the Logan Act was raised last year over former national security adviser Michael Flynn ’ s negotiations at the United Nations over a resolution with Israel during the Trump transition .
“ John Kerry helped craft a flaccid deal that granted the terror regime in Tehran vast monetary and geopolitical concessions , even as it put them on the glide path to nuclear weapons by its own terms , ” Sohrab Ahmari , senior writer at Commentary magazine , told Fox News . “ The biggest public service he can render now is to go away . ”
Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said Kerry ’ s move “ certainly raises Logan Act questions . ”
He pointed to an alleged double standard , suggesting there would be a bigger outcry if Bush-era Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice had done the same during the Obama administration .
There was a significant outcry from Democrats and the Obama administration in 2015 when Republicans -- led by Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton -- wrote to Iranian leadership explaining the difference between an executive agreement and a treaty .
The letter suggested that any deal without a congressional vote could be modified by a future Congress or revoked with “ the stroke of a pen ” by whoever replaces President Obama .
At that time , Kerry slammed Cotton 's move as an “ unconstitutional , un-thought-out action by somebody who has been in the United States Senate for 60-something days . ''
Harvard Law School professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz said Saturday that Kerry is lucky that no one has been prosecuted under the Logan Act or else he could be in trouble .
“ Fortunately for everybody , the Logan Act [ is a ] dead letter but if it were in existence , my friend John Kerry would be violating the Logan Act , ” Dershowitz said on “ Fox & Friends . ”
Although Kerry would not likely be prosecuted into the Logan Act , Dershowitz said that there are “ real problems ” with what Kerry is doing .
“ He is negotiating , though he is not in the administration , and there are real problems with doing that , ” he continued .
According to The Globe , Kerry has also been trying to get Congress on his side by placing dozens of phone calls , including to House Speaker Paul Ryan .
Kerry is reported to have coordinated his push with a group of former top State Department advisers who helped negotiate the Iran deal -- named Diplomacy Works . The group has reportedly chosen to focus on Europeans , Israelis and non-partisan experts to try and salvage the deal .
“ This isn ’ t President Obama ’ s agreement . It ’ s the world ’ s agreement , ” David Wade , a longtime Kerry adviser and advisor to Diplomacy Works , told The Globe . “ Maybe Macron , Merkel , and Great Britain can persuade the administration , but if they can ’ t they ’ ll be even more essential to protecting the deal absent the United States . We know these voices are powerful . They have an audience with the president and our allies are popular at home . ”
Diplomacy Works did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News .
Trump has been critical not only of the Iran deal but also Kerry ’ s role in negotiating the deal in particular . He has repeatedly called him the “ worst negotiator I ’ ve ever seen . ”
On Friday , Trump mocked Kerry at the National Rifle Association ’ s annual conference in Dallas , Texas , describing him as “ not the best negotiator we ’ ve ever seen ” and mocking Kerry for breaking his leg during 2015 negotiations .
“ He never walked away from the table , except to be in that bicycle race where he fell and broke his leg , ” he said to cheers from the crowd . “ That was the only time . ”","Former Secretary of State John Kerry is under fire over a report claiming that he has been engaged in “shadow diplomacy” with officials from Iran and Europe as part of a final attempt to save the seemingly doomed 2015 Iran nuclear deal.

state_department,CNN (Web News),0,http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/26/opinions/clinton-email-server-ig-report-opinion-cox/index.html,OPINION: Hillary Clinton's shrinking email defense,2016-05-26,Douglas Cox,"Douglas Cox is an associate professor at the City University of New York School of Law . The views expressed are his own .
( CNN ) While an FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton 's email server continues , the State Department 's Office of Inspector General has raised the stakes with the release of a remarkable report finding that Clinton 's actions violated State Department policies and were inconsistent with federal record-keeping laws .
The report also discloses new details relevant to Clinton 's motives and her assertion that the use of a private server was simply a matter of convenience . While criminal charges still remain highly unlikely , the inspector general 's report is significant and unquestionably damaging to Clinton 's public defense .
Most crucially , the inspector general directly contradicts Clinton 's repeated assertions that she complied both with federal law and State Department policies . `` At a minimum , '' the report finds , `` Secretary Clinton should have surrendered all emails dealing with Department business before leaving government service and , because she did not do so , she did not comply with Department 's policies that were implemented in accordance with the Federal Records Act . ''
The report goes further , noting that while Clinton 's subsequent production of 55,000 pages of emails in response to State Department demands partially corrected these violations , the records Clinton turned over were incomplete . Remarkably , the report includes reference to a previously unreleased 2010 email in which Clinton , responding to her deputy chief of staff for operations , Huma Abedin , directly addresses her lack of an official State Department email account and voices a fear of the `` risk of the personal being accessible '' if she had one . In a briefing , State Department officials were unable to confirm the source of this email , but if it was omitted from the records Clinton produced , it again would raise questions about the process she used to distinguish between `` federal records '' and `` personal records '' before destroying the latter .
The inspector general also reveals the comments of State Department records management staff in late 2010 expressly raising concerns that Clinton 's private email server `` could contain federal records that needed to be preserved in order to satisfy federal record-keeping requirements . '' A senior official rebuffed these concerns , claiming that Clinton 's email arrangement `` had been approved by the department legal staff '' -- an assertion the inspector general concluded was untrue -- and directed staff `` never to speak of the secretary 's personal email system again . ''

Such facts undermine the argument that the significance of maintaining a private server and the negative effects it could have , including on responses to Freedom of Information Act requests or congressional subpoenas , were simply overlooked .
Clinton 's response to the report is further complicated by the fact that the State Department did not contest the inspector general 's findings , concurred with its recommendations , and even acknowledges in its response that `` the department could have done better at preserving emails . '' All of this would serve to undermine assertions by Clinton that the inspector general 's conclusions are biased or politically motivated .
Indeed , thus far Clinton 's response has focused on the argument that other secretaries of state also used private email . `` Well there may be reports that come out , '' Clinton commented , `` but nothing has changed . It 's the same story . Just like previous secretaries of state I used a personal email , many people did . It was not at all unprecedented . '' And , it is true that the inspector general does not spare former Secretary Colin Powell from similar allegations , documenting his use of private email and his admitted failure to preserve those emails .
Yet this arguably only furthers the perception that the inspector general 's review was both balanced and non-biased . And Clinton 's response highlights how her defense -- which began with confident assertions that she followed all the rules and broke no laws -- has now been reduced to the argument that `` others did it too '' or that the rules she violated were not significant .
Despite the inspector general 's report , criminal charges against Clinton remain highly unlikely .

(CNN) While an FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server continues, the State Department's Office of Inspector General has raised the stakes with the release of a remarkable report finding that Clinton's actions violated State Department policies and were inconsistent with federal record-keeping laws.

The report also discloses new details relevant to Clinton's motives and her assertion that the use of a private server was simply a matter of convenience. While criminal charges still remain highly unlikely, the inspector general's report is significant and unquestionably damaging to Clinton's public defense.

Most crucially, the inspector general directly contradicts Clinton's repeated assertions that she complied both with federal law and State Department policies. ""At a minimum,"" the report finds, ""Secretary Clinton should have surrendered all emails dealing with Department business before leaving government service and, because she did not do so, she did not comply with Department's policies that were implemented in accordance with the Federal Records Act.""

The report goes further, noting that while Clinton's subsequent production of 55,000 pages of emails in response to State Department demands partially corrected these violations, the records Clinton turned over were incomplete. Remarkably, the report includes reference to a previously unreleased 2010 email in which Clinton, responding to her deputy chief of staff for operations, Huma Abedin, directly addresses her lack of an official State Department email account and voices a fear of the ""risk of the personal being accessible"" if she had one. In a briefing, State Department officials were unable to confirm the source of this email, but if it was omitted from the records Clinton produced, it again would raise questions about the process she used to distinguish between ""federal records"" and ""personal records"" before destroying the latter.

The inspector general also reveals the comments of State Department records management staff in late 2010 expressly raising concerns that Clinton's private email server ""could contain federal records that needed to be preserved in order to satisfy federal record-keeping requirements."" A senior official rebuffed these concerns, claiming that Clinton's email arrangement ""had been approved by the department legal staff"" -- an assertion the inspector general concluded was untrue -- and directed staff ""never to speak of the secretary's personal email system again.""

Such facts undermine the argument that the significance of maintaining a private server and the negative effects it could have, including on responses to Freedom of Information Act requests or congressional subpoenas, were simply overlooked.

Clinton's response

Clinton's response to the report is further complicated by the fact that the State Department did not contest the inspector general's findings, concurred with its recommendations, and even acknowledges in its response that ""the department could have done better at preserving emails."" All of this would serve to undermine assertions by Clinton that the inspector general's conclusions are biased or politically motivated.

Indeed, thus far Clinton's response has focused on the argument that other secretaries of state also used private email. ""Well there may be reports that come out,"" Clinton commented, ""but nothing has changed. It's the same story. Just like previous secretaries of state I used a personal email, many people did. It was not at all unprecedented."" And, it is true that the inspector general does not spare former Secretary Colin Powell from similar allegations, documenting his use of private email and his admitted failure to preserve those emails.

Yet this arguably only furthers the perception that the inspector general's review was both balanced and non-biased. And Clinton's response highlights how her defense -- which began with confident assertions that she followed all the rules and broke no laws -- has now been reduced to the argument that ""others did it too"" or that the rules she violated were not significant.

Criminal charges?

Despite the inspector general's report, criminal charges against Clinton remain highly unlikely. While the report provides previously nonpublic information relevant to Clinton's motivations, the available public evidence remains insufficient to illustrate two facts needed for a criminal charge -- that she knew that emails on her private server were classified and that she intentionally mishandled classified information.

Yet the inspector general's report also highlights the uncertainty that surrounds the precise scope of the current FBI investigation. To the extent the FBI has limited its inquiry to security issues and the possible mishandling of classified information, for example, the inspector general's report finding violations of the federal records laws potentially implicates a different criminal statute.

Removing, concealing, or destroying federal records, regardless of whether they are classified, can constitute a federal felony. But again, courts have generally required prosecutors pursuing this charge to prove that defendants knew they were violating the law, for which the evidence against Clinton appears to be lacking.

In the end, extracting the truth in the Clinton email controversy in the current polarized political environment remains a nearly impossible task.

Some have already begun to seize upon the inspector general's report, mischaracterizing it as clear evidence of a crime. And when the Department of Justice announces that it is not filing criminal charges -- as is both expected and perhaps inevitable -- Clinton will likely argue that it constitutes proof that she did nothing wrong.

Based on the publicly available evidence, the reality appears to be nuanced in a way that is satisfying to neither side.

state_department,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jun/23/state-department-downplays-iran-role-in-latin-amer/,State secrets: Kerry’s department downplays Iran’s role in Latin America; likely to anger Congress,2013-06-23,Guy Taylor,"Iran is not supporting active terrorist cells in the Western Hemisphere , according to a State Department report set to be released this week that is likely to ignite a major battle with Capitol Hill .
Although the number of Iranian officials operating in Latin America has increased in recent years , Tehran has far less influence and activities than some congressional Republicans have suggested , sources familiar with the report said .
The analysis found no reliable information pointing to imminent Iranian-backed terrorist plots in the Western Hemisphere , said sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the secretive nature of the report and because it had not yet been sent to Congress .
The State Department declined to comment on the document , which is expected to be delivered to House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Edward R. Royce , California Republican , at the end of this week .
The findings are likely to baffle lawmakers who pushed legislation that mandated the State Department to produce the report , along with a strategy for countering “ Iran ’ s growing hostile presence and activity in the Western Hemisphere . ”
Support for the legislation rose after the Justice Department claimed in 2011 that Iran attempted to hire a Mexican drug cartel to assassinate a Saudi diplomat by bombing a Washington restaurant . An Iranian-American was recently sentenced to 25 years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiring in the plot with the Iranian military .
Although Congress cited that case as a reason for the State Department to more closely scrutinize Iran ’ s presence in the hemisphere , the Hollywood-like and far-fetched quality of the case also spawned skepticism among foreign policy insiders — particularly at Foggy Bottom .
“ I don ’ t believe the State Department ever wanted to do this report . We sort of forced them into this position , ” Rep. Jeff Duncan , South Carolina Republican , said Friday .
Mr. Duncan , who worked with Rep. Brian Higgins , New York Democrat , in pushing legislation that mandated the report , said State Department officials have privately “ played down ” the Latin American activities of Iran and Hezbollah — the Tehran-backed Shiite terrorist organization .
He explained that , during a congressional visit to Paraguay in August , he was briefed by a senior member of the South American nation ’ s police forces . “ It was very clear to him that the Iranians and their proxy are very active in that region , ” Mr. Duncan said .
“ But that was different from a watered-down assessment we got from State Department officials there at the U.S. Embassy in Paraguay , ” he said . “ They really played down the Hezbollah and Iranian activity . ”
One source , outside the government but close to the Obama administration , said the State Department report will conclude that “ yes , there are a lot more Iranian agents in the region and that tabs are being kept on them . ”
Although U.S. officials are “ not foreclosing the possibility that networks could be activated , there is no hard evidence of any plots , ” the source said .
Such comments suggest that the report drew from the same well of intelligence that resulted in the carefully worded analysis of Iran in the State Department ’ s annual Country Reports on Terrorism last month .
The words “ Western Hemisphere ” and “ Latin America ” were notably absent from the assertion that “ Iran and Hizballah ’ s terrorist activity has reached a tempo unseen since the 1990s , with attacks plotted in Southeast Asia , Europe , and Africa . ”
Although the analysis found that Iran has “ continued to try to expand its presence and bilateral relationships ” in Latin America and that sympathizers in the region “ provide financial and ideological support ” to al Qaeda and Hezbollah , the outright conclusion was that “ there were no known operational cells of either al-Qa ’ ida or Hizballah in the hemisphere . ”
Such findings have prompted some analysts to praise the State Department and the Obama administration for standing up to attempts by some in Congress to hype the Iranian threat .
“ Most of the evidence that ’ s been cited publicly by these people who are claiming Iran is using Latin America as a base to launch attacks has either been disproven or remains questionable , ” said Christopher Sabatini , the head of policy at the Council of the Americas in New York .
Debate over the subject has been swirling through Washington and other Western Hemisphere power centers since the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires .
The bombing , which killed 85 people and made headlines worldwide , has never been officially resolved , although Argentine prosecutors have long accused Iran of directing the attack and Hezbollah of carrying it out .
In a related development , prosecutor Alberto Nisman has issued a report accusing Iran of having established terrorist networks throughout Latin America since the 1980s .
Iranian authorities have infiltrated “ several South American countries by building local clandestine intelligence stations designed to sponsor , foster and execute terrorist attacks , ” said an article last month by The Long War Journal based on a summary of Mr. Nisman ’ s report .
Mr. Duncan , meanwhile , said his staff had reviewed that Argentine prosecutor ’ s findings and that they are likely to receive attention during congressional hearings on the State Department ’ s report .
He added that the Obama administration , whose policy toward Iran has centered on attempting to contain the Islamic republic ’ s nuclear program , may be less than eager to talk about Tehran ’ s reach into Latin America .
“ I honestly think the administration is trying to placate Iran to get some concessions on the nuclear arms buildup , ” Mr. Duncan said . “ The administration doesn ’ t want to raise the ire of Iranians by focusing on their role in the Western Hemisphere . ”
The congressman added : “ We can ’ t be light on one side and heavy on the other . I think we ’ ve got to talk in real terms about the whole threat . ”","Iran is not supporting active terrorist cells in the Western Hemisphere, according to a State Department report set to be released this week that is likely to ignite a major battle with Capitol Hill.

Although the number of Iranian officials operating in Latin America has increased in recent years, Tehran has far less influence and activities than some congressional Republicans have suggested, sources familiar with the report said.

The analysis found no reliable information pointing to imminent Iranian-backed terrorist plots in the Western Hemisphere, said sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the secretive nature of the report and because it had not yet been sent to Congress.

The State Department declined to comment on the document, which is expected to be delivered to House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Edward R. Royce, California Republican, at the end of this week.

The findings are likely to baffle lawmakers who pushed legislation that mandated the State Department to produce the report, along with a strategy for countering “Iran’s growing hostile presence and activity in the Western Hemisphere.”

Support for the legislation rose after the Justice Department claimed in 2011 that Iran attempted to hire a Mexican drug cartel to assassinate a Saudi diplomat by bombing a Washington restaurant. An Iranian-American was recently sentenced to 25 years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiring in the plot with the Iranian military.

Although Congress cited that case as a reason for the State Department to more closely scrutinize Iran’s presence in the hemisphere, the Hollywood-like and far-fetched quality of the case also spawned skepticism among foreign policy insiders — particularly at Foggy Bottom.

“I don’t believe the State Department ever wanted to do this report. We sort of forced them into this position,” Rep. Jeff Duncan, South Carolina Republican, said Friday.

Mr. Duncan, who worked with Rep. Brian Higgins, New York Democrat, in pushing legislation that mandated the report, said State Department officials have privately “played down” the Latin American activities of Iran and Hezbollah — the Tehran-backed Shiite terrorist organization.

He explained that, during a congressional visit to Paraguay in August, he was briefed by a senior member of the South American nation’s police forces. “It was very clear to him that the Iranians and their proxy are very active in that region,” Mr. Duncan said.

“But that was different from a watered-down assessment we got from State Department officials there at the U.S. Embassy in Paraguay,” he said. “They really played down the Hezbollah and Iranian activity.”

Lack of evidence

One source, outside the government but close to the Obama administration, said the State Department report will conclude that “yes, there are a lot more Iranian agents in the region and that tabs are being kept on them.”

Although U.S. officials are “not foreclosing the possibility that networks could be activated, there is no hard evidence of any plots,” the source said.

Such comments suggest that the report drew from the same well of intelligence that resulted in the carefully worded analysis of Iran in the State Department’s annual Country Reports on Terrorism last month.

Although the analysis found that Iran has “continued to try to expand its presence and bilateral relationships” in Latin America and that sympathizers in the region “provide financial and ideological support” to al Qaeda and Hezbollah, the outright conclusion was that “there were no known operational cells of either al-Qa’ida or Hizballah in the hemisphere.”

Such findings have prompted some analysts to praise the State Department and the Obama administration for standing up to attempts by some in Congress to hype the Iranian threat.

“Most of the evidence that’s been cited publicly by these people who are claiming Iran is using Latin America as a base to launch attacks has either been disproven or remains questionable,” said Christopher Sabatini, the head of policy at the Council of the Americas in New York.

Strategy of denial?

Trump’s White House is expected to bolster its communications team, bringing on former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi and former Treasury Department spokesman Tony Sayegh to help make its case in the weeks to come, according to a senior administration official.

Trump’s defenders say there is no evidence of him and the Ukrainian president engaging in a “quid pro quo” - or exchanging a favor for a favor - because the aid to Ukraine was released and Zelenskiy never explicitly promised to investigate Burisma, the Bidens, or any involvement in the 2016 election.

A quid pro quo is not necessary, however, to prove high crimes or misdemeanors, which is the standard the U.S. Constitution requires for the impeachment of a president.

The top lawmakers on the House and Senate intelligence committee have been notified in recent days that the extent of classified information on Mrs. Clinton ’ s private email server was likely far more extensive than the four emails publicly acknowledged last week as containing some sensitive spy agency secrets .
A U.S. official directly familiar with the notification , who spoke only on the condition of anonymity , said the notification of possibly hundreds of additional emails with classified secrets came from the State Department Freedom of Information Act office to the Office of Inspector General for the Director of National Intelligence .
The inspector general , the chief oversight watchdog for the entire U.S. intelligence community , subsequently sent a letter to the Republican chairmen and ranking Democrats of the Senate and House intelligence committees , the official said .
“ We were informed by State FOIA officials that there are potentially hundreds of classified emails within the 30,000 provided for former Secretary Clinton , ” DNI Inspector General I. Charles McCullough III late last week wrote Sen. Richard Burr , North Carolina Republican ; Sen. Dianne Feinstein , California Democrat ; Rep. Devin Nunes , California Republican ; and Rep. Adam B. Schiff , California Democrat .
“ We note that none of the emails we reviewed had classification or dissemination markings but some included IC-derived classified information and should have been handled as classified , appropriately marked and transmitted via a secure server , ” Mr. McCullough wrote the four lawmakers .
The U.S. official said the intelligence community has been informed that secret information had been contained in some of Mrs. Clinton ’ s private emails that originated from the FBI , the DNI and the CIA as well as a spy satellite agency . It is believed the 30,000 emails remain on a thumb drive in the possession of Mrs. Clinton ’ s private attorney , David Kendall .
The official said the intelligence community ’ s first response was to take steps to secure the handling of remaining 30,000 emails and make sure they were handled on top-secret servers to avoid any further breaches , and then to assess any damage to national security from the insecure handling and release of information already in some of the publicly disseminated emails .
“ Containment first , then a damage assessment is how this must be handled , ” the official said .
The official said the intelligence community was already concerned , for instance , that some classified information was inadvertently disclosed by the State Department in recent weeks when one of Mrs. Clinton ’ s emails about Libya was publicly released .
The inspector general ’ s notification to Capitol Hill and the Justice Department also opens possible legal exposure for Mrs. Clinton about improper handling of classified materials , something her attorney knows much about .
Mr. Kendall represented former CIA Director David H. Petraeus last year when he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of mishandling national secrets because he gave some classified information to his mistress and biographer and stored a classified book of information in his home in an insecure manner .
Separately , Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley , Iowa Republican , sent a letter to FBI Director James Comey asking him to explain what the bureau was doing to keep secure the classified information within 30,000 Clinton emails known to be on Mr. Kendall ’ s thumb drive .
“ It ’ s a serious breach of national security if the United States government fails to secure classified material in the hands of people not authorized to possess it , no matter who they are . There are fundamental questions as to what the FBI is doing to securing these classified emails and why the State Department is not fully cooperating with the inspectors general at the State Department and the Intelligence Community to ensure that all of the appropriate emails are identified , ” Mr. Grassley wrote .
Mr. Grassley also sent a letter to Secretary of State John F. Kerry inquiring about the delay in sending the 30,000 emails to intelligence community inspectors general .
Mrs. Clinton , the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination , fended off the new questions about the email scandal and suspicious foreign donations to the Clinton Foundation , distracting from her effort to wrangle support from union bosses at the AFL-CIO ’ s annual summer meeting .
The former secretary of state ’ s email woes deepened when a federal judge scolded the State Department for delays in releasing the documents , as the agency revealed that Mrs. Clinton ’ s closest aides and top officials during her tenure at the agency — Huma Abedin , Cheryl Mills and Jake Sullivan — also used private email accounts and all of their message have not been turned over to the State Department .
“ I think we have been proceeding in a timely fashion , and indeed the vast majority of the emails that I turned over and that are being turned over by others were already in the State Department system , ” Mrs. Clinton said at a press conference at the union meeting in the Washington suburb of Silver Spring , Maryland .
Her response to reporters was the same explanation she gave in March , when it came to light that she had used a private email account exclusively for official business as America ’ s top diplomat , shielding her correspondence from probes by Congress and requests under the Freedom of Information Act .
It remains unclear how much of her email was captured by the State Department system during exchanges with other agency employees , especially since other high-ranking officials at the agency also were using private email accounts .
Mrs. Clinton batted questions about the email back at the agency .
“ This is really a question for the State Department , ” she said at the union press conference . “ They are the ones that are bearing the responsibility to sort through these thousands and thousands of emails and determine at what pace they can be released , and I really hope that it will be as quickly as possible . ”
Mrs. Clinton has insisted that she followed the rules and used a private email account because it was more convenient for her than juggling two smartphones . But nearly two years after she left office and after a congressional probe learned about her private email account , she turned over about 30,000 messages to the State Department and erased another 32,000 messages that she deemed personal .
At some point , she wiped clean the email server kept in her home in Chappaqua , New York , preventing any of the messages from being recovered .
Questions about her email setup and foreign donations to the Clinton Foundation while she was secretary of state , which potentially posed conflicts of interest , have dogged Mrs. Clinton ’ s presidential campaign . The controversies have hit her in the polls , with a majority of voters nationwide saying they don ’ t think she is honest and trustworthy .
The former first lady , senator and top diplomat also had to tamp down reports about increased donations to the Clinton Foundation from Swiss bank USB after she intervened to settle IRS charges that the bank had helped thousands of Americans use secret accounts to avoid U.S. taxes .
Coinciding with Mrs. Clinton ’ s involvement , the bank ’ s donations to the Clinton Foundation grew from less than $ 60,000 in 2008 to roughly $ 600,000 by the end of 2014 . The bank also paid Mrs. Clinton ’ s husband , former President Bill Clinton , $ 1.5 million for participating in a series of corporate events , The Wall Street Journal reported .
In June , The ███ reported that Mr. Clinton ’ s foundation set up a fundraising arm in Sweden that collected $ 26 million in donations at the same time that country was lobbying Mrs. Clinton ’ s State Department to forgo sanctions that threatened its thriving business with Iran .
The Swedish entity , called the William J. Clinton Foundation Insamlingsstiftelse , was never disclosed to or cleared by State Department ethics officials , even though one of its largest sources of donations was a Swedish government-sanctioned lottery .
As the money flowed to the foundation from Sweden , Mrs. Clinton ’ s team in Washington declined to blacklist any Swedish firms despite warnings from career officials at the U.S. Embassy in Stockholm that Sweden was expanding its economic ties with Iran and potentially undercutting Western efforts to end Tehran ’ s rogue nuclear program , diplomatic cables show .
Mrs. Clinton said any implication of wrongdoing was “ categorically false . ”
“ I worked hard as our nation ’ s first diplomat to solve problems , to work with my colleagues in government , ” she said . “ I remember the governmentwide efforts to try to pursue America ’ s interest with respect to Swiss banks and there was a resolution to that , and it continued to be the subject of diplomacy and law enforcement interest . ”
“ You know , this is just the kind of unfortunate claim or charge that you see in campaigns , ” Mrs. Clinton said .
The press conference demonstrated that her answers have not settled the matters and the scandals will continue to overshadow her campaign .
At the AFL-CIO meeting , Mrs. Clinton met with the union leaders behind closed doors to woo support with her pledge to fight for higher wages and for laws that would make it easier to unionize workplaces .
“ I asked for their support going forward . I asked them to be my partner in making sure that we stand against those powerful forces on the other side that don ’ t agree with the [ union ] agenda , ” she said .
Union insiders say the leadership prefers more aggressively pro-union candidates such as Sen. Bernard Sanders , the Vermont independent and avowed socialist who has emerged as the chief rival to Mrs. Clinton .
But Mr. Sanders trails by a wide margin and is widely viewed as unable to win .
That leaves the unions stuck with Mrs. Clinton , the all-but-inevitable nominee who has refused to take a position on the Keytsone XL oil pipeline or the pending trade deal with Pacific Rim countries — issues that are top priorities for unions .
“ That ’ s what we ’ re waiting for — for her to take a stand , ” said an official from a union local at the meeting .","The U.S. intelligence community is bracing for the possibility that former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton’s private email account contains hundreds of revelations of classified information from spy agencies and is taking steps to contain any damage to national security, according to documents and interviews Thursday.

Tillerson has been busy solidifying his position by starting to build the Washington constituency he never had , and showing signs of permanence after surviving one of the most difficult years ever endured by any modern secretary of state .
It might not seem like much , but he 's managed to get the White House to sign off on his own pick , career diplomat and China expert Susan Thornton -- an enemy of the populist , nationalist wing of the administration -- as his top official on East Asia . And more of his picks are arriving at Foggy Bottom soon .
Tillerson is opening up to the media , conducting interviews with top outlets while his staff promises more access to a press pack he largely snubbed in his first year in office . And the secretary is telling friends and colleagues that he wo n't let his West Wing antagonists , who are known to include the President 's son-in-law Jared Kushner and national security adviser H.R . McMaster , run him out of town .
And while the unpredictable Trump could again sour on Tillerson at any moment , the secretary of state is making it implicitly clear that only a direct push from the President -- who , despite his `` you 're fired '' mantra , struggles with in person dismissals -- will do it .
`` I think we 're going to have a very productive 2018 , '' Tillerson told CNN in an interview on Friday . `` I intend to be here for the whole year . ''
Tillerson 's show of stubbornness is perhaps a sign that after struggling to transition from the rituals of the boardroom to the Washington bear pit , he 's learning how this town works .
But in keeping with the whiplash style of his leadership , Trump suggested on Saturday , days after mocking Kim over the size of his nuclear button , that he 'd be willing to talk to the North Korean leader over the phone , and gave `` Rex '' a shout out for his work in a possible sign that the secretary of state is making headway .

The US state department is hosting a 68-nation meeting on Wednesday aimed at consolidating the international effort against Islamic State .
But the foreign ministers are convening in Washington at a time when the state department itself is under siege , facing swingeing budget cuts by a hostile White House , and led by a former oil executive who has said he did not want the job in the first place .
Rex Tillerson has billed the counter-Isis coalition meeting as a decisive moment “ to set Isis on a lasting and irreversible path to defeat ” . The secretary of state lambasted the Obama administration for its policy on Isis , claiming his predecessor never had a proper strategy to defeat the extremist movement .
Is Rex Tillerson the weakest secretary of state of all time ? | Isaac Stone Fish Read more
“ All that did was drag out the agony for everyone , ” Tillerson told the Independent Journal Review ( IJR ) , in his first interview since he surfaced in December as a surprise candidate for the role of secretary of state .
He said that the then president-elect , Donald Trump , had invited him to his transition headquarters in New York ostensibly to talk “ about the world ” and then stunned Tillerson , about to retire as head of ExxonMobil , by offering him the post of the nation ’ s top diplomat .
He said it was his wife who persuaded to accept the offer , telling him he was “ supposed to do this ” .
He made clear that the anti-Isis effort would be a priority for him and the defence secretary , James Mattis , who will also take part in Wednesday ’ s coalition meeting . A top Tillerson aide is quoted in the IJR article as saying the two men “ get along like gin and vermouth ” .
Over the course of the election campaign , Trump assured voters that he had a plan to defeat Isis , but never elaborated what that plan was . Tillerson and Mattis will seek to outline a strategy on Wednesday .
Tillerson explained it as a three-step process beginning with a military campaign , followed by a transition phase and a stability programme . It remains unclear , however , what that would mean in practice and how this plan would differ from the previous administration ’ s anti-Isis campaign , which was in full swing when Barack Obama left office .
One departure is that the new administration has stepped up the number of US ground troops involved in the push towards the Isis stronghold of Raqqa in Syria , a reflection of a general military-first bent of the Trump White House .
Its budget proposals would see a cut for the state department and US foreign aid of 28 % of its current budget to less than $ 26bn ( £21bn ) . When other cuts to contingency funds are taken into account , the effective funding decrease is about a third . Meanwhile , under the “ Make America Great Again ” budget , military spending is meant to rise by $ 54bn .
Senior Republicans in Congress have said they would oppose such deep cuts , but Tillerson himself has been criticised by former state department officials and supporters of US diplomacy for failing to stand up to Trump on the issue .
In the interview published by IJR on Tuesday night , Tillerson said state department spending was unsustainable . He claimed he talked to the president on a daily basis but conceded he had not discussed with him what such a sharp decrease in funding would mean . “ We haven ’ t gotten that far yet , ” he said .
Out of the loop : Rex Tillerson finds state department sidelined by White House Read more
Antony Blinken , the deputy secretary of state in the Obama administration , said the bid to boost military spending at the expense of funding diplomacy represented a “ fundamental misunderstanding ” of national security .
“ Diplomacy is national security , ” Blinken said . He pointed out that without strong US diplomacy around the world , there would not be a coalition of more than 60 countries in the fight against Isis .
The cuts , Blinken said : “ have the potential to dramatically dilute our soft power , and that has done wonders for us over many years and many places ” .
“ In a world in which all you have is your hard power , all of a sudden every problem is a nail and the only tool you have is a hammer , ” he added . “ The first people who ’ ll tell you that ’ s misguided is our military . ”
In discussing the primacy of the fight against Isis , Tillerson appeared to turn the previous administration ’ s approach on its head . Obama and his secretary of state , John Kerry , saw the spread of Isis as being a consequence of the brutal nature of the counter-insurgency conducted by Russian , Iran and the Damascus regime . Extremism could only be defeated ultimately by an end to the war and a political transition .
Tillerson suggested that the fight against Isis had to come first : “ We can ’ t get to deconflicting the rest of the region with Isis in the way , ” he said . Neither he , nor anyone else in the Trump administration , has explained what such an approach means for cooperation with Russia , Iran or the Assad government in Damascus .
David Miliband , former UK foreign secretary and now president of the International Rescue Committee , said those decisions had to be made at the outset of any new strategy .
“ The US needs to decide what role it wants to play , and who it wants to ally with , in the debates about the future of those parts of Syria still outside government control , and the future shape of a national government , ” Miliband said .
“ This can not be considered independently of the commitment to defeat Isis in Iraq , where the US again faces the conundrum that Iran has the same declared enemy , but where victory threatens to extend its influence . ”
Before it decides how to frame its new relations with US adversaries , critics of the new administration say , it has to find a way to stop alienating its allies around the world .
Trump used an awkward visit by Angela Merkel to Washington last week to berate Germany for not spending enough on defence , while his spokesman refused to apologise for an apparent endorsement of a baseless claim that the UK had spied on Trump on behalf of the Obama administration .
In his interview , Tillerson appeared to accuse South Korean officials of lying after it was reported in the Seoul press that he had not dined with his Korean counterparts ( a diplomatic norm in Seoul and in many other capitals ) because he had been fatigued .
“ They never invited us for dinner , then at the last minute they realised that optically it wasn ’ t playing very well in public for them , so they put out a statement that we didn ’ t have dinner because I was tired , ” he said .
The secretary of state waded from that row directly into another , with America ’ s transatlantic allies , when Reuters new agency broke the news on Monday that he would be skipping a Nato foreign ministers meeting in early April so he could attend a Trump meeting with the Chinese president , Xi Jinping , and that he would be flying to Moscow later in the same month .

[pullquote]

Two years ago North Africa and the Middle East were relatively calm and stable. Granted, some of the countries were run by dictators, but they were pro-American dictators. Most of them were in fact cooperating with us by sharing intelligence on terrorists and Islamic extremists.

They were at peace with Israel.

Some were even enjoying relatively high levels of economic growth, despite the economic downturn in much of the rest of the world. For example, Egypt’s economy was growing at nearly 8% immediately before they ousted President Mubarak.

Today the entire region, from North Africa to the Middle East to the Persian Gulf all the way to Afghanistan, Pakistan and Central Asia is in upheaval. Another Arab-Israeli war threatens. Al Qaeda has expanded is reach and intensity throughout the region. Anti-Americanism is on the rise. What has gone wrong in just two short years?

This is Congress’ last opportunity to hear from one of the chief architects of the administration’s much vaunted Arab spring policy. It’s a program that the administration heralded with great fanfare two years ago. Today it looks like the entire region is descending into political and economic chaos.

So instead of beating a dead horse on what went wrong in Benghazi, the Senators and Congressmen should ask Secretary Clinton ten new questions:

1) Why was the Administration quick to embrace the anti-American, anti-Israel Muslim Brotherhood as the new leadership of Egypt? Why have we stood by while Al Qaeda is setting up shop in Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula?

2) Why were no efforts made to secure Qaddafi’s large weapons caches in Libya before he was removed from office?

3) Are we about to make the same mistake again with Assad’s chemical weapons in Syria? Will his chemical and other advanced weapons fall into the hands of terrorists and Islamic extremists as his government collapses?

4) Why has the administration failed to punish those responsible for killing Americans and attacking American soil in Benghazi?

5) You have chosen to have a ‘light footprint’ throughout North Africa and the Middle East to avoid making the mistakes the Bush Administration made in Iraq and Afghanistan. But hasn’t this ‘light footprint’ been insufficient to help the new, fledging governments in Arab spring countries consolidate control and establish security?

6) Has the administration taken any steps to provide for the safety of thousands of American civilians being left behind in Iraq and Afghanistan after our troops withdraw?

7) Why has the Administration chosen to distance itself from Israel, America’s long time, closest ally in the region?

8) What if sanctions prove insufficient to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons? What will the US do if forced to choose between bombing Iran and letting Iran get the bomb?

9) What contingency plans does the administration have to rescue Americans in the event they are taken hostage in North African and Middle Eastern countries?

10) The drone wars have been effective in killing Al Qaeda and Taliban leaders in Pakistan and Yemen. Is the Administration planning to expand the drone wars to North Africa, the Middle East and the Saudi Peninsula?

Secretary Clinton has a lot of explaining to do. So does the national security team nominated for President Obama’s second term. If Congress and the American people don’t get answers now, they never will. If so, in just a few years time we will be asking ourselves, “who lost the Arab world”? It is crucial to get Secretary Clinton on the record now.",www.foxnews.com,right,WcaekRVqTSd183Vl

Secretary of State John Kerry presided over a ceremony reopening the U.S. Embassy in Havana, including a flag-raising ceremony — an event that will mark the first time the Stars and Stripes have flown over a diplomatic compound there in 54 years.

Kerry, speaking before assembled dignitaries, remembered the strained history of U.S.-Cuba relations, including the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, when the Soviet Union was discovered to be siting nuclear rockets on the island nation.

""I was a student then and I could still remember the taut faces of our leaders,"" he said. ""We were unsettled and uncertain about our future because we didn't know when we went to bed what we would find when we woke up.""

The people of Cuba ""would be best served by a genuine democracy,"" he said, but added that it was ""unrealistic"" to expect Cuba to make such a transition anytime soon. ""Cuba's future is for Cubans to shape,"" he said.

Speaking in Spanish, Kerry said the ceremony showed that the U.S. and Cuba ""are no longer enemies, but neighbors.""

Three U.S. Marines who lowered the flag at the embassy in 1961, when Havana and Washington severed diplomatic ties, accompanied Kerry to the ceremony and presented the new flag to Marines to hoist once again to the strains of the Star Spangled Banner.

The Washington Post reports that the three Marines, retired Master Gunnery Sgt. Jim Tracy and then-Lance Cpl. Larry C. Morris and then-Cpl. F.W. Mike East, all now in their 70s, ""will appear in Havana alongside Secretary of State John F. Kerry and raise the flag again. It has been more than 54 years since U.S. relations with Cuba were severed, but the embassy has reopened following an agreement reached earlier this year between Havana and Washington.""

NPR's Michele Kelemen says: ""The State Department has come under criticism for not inviting leading Cuban dissidents to the embassy. Officials say that's because this is a government-to-government event. Activists are invited to a reception later, at the U.S. ambassador's residence.""

Story Continued Below

Mills sat on the foundation’s board before becoming the department’s No. 2 official and returned to the board after leaving State in 2013.

The emails, unearthed in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by the conservative group Citizens United, offer a fuller picture of the agency’s dialogue with foundation officials about whether paid speaking appearances — particularly in foreign countries — by former President Clinton would pose ethical issues for his wife, the nation’s top diplomat. State Department ethics officials reviewed hundreds of speaking requests for Bill Clinton submitted by the foundation and rejected only a few of them.

Mills’ involvement with some of the most sensitive speaking requests shows that top foundation officials felt comfortable seeking advice directly from Hillary Clinton’s closest adviser and consulted her privately on speaking requests involving hundreds of thousands of dollars. The back-channel contacts do not appear to violate agency rules.

Mills attorney Beth Wilkinson, a partner at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, argued in a statement Tuesday evening that her client simply gave advice and did not officially approve the arrangements.

“When staff from President Clinton’s Office or the Clinton Foundation sought Cheryl’s views on a proposed or upcoming activity, she would share her opinion and/or, when appropriate, forward it to an individual in the Department for any action,” her lawyer said. “In the case of the President’s speeches, the Legal Advisor’s Office reviewed and made a determination regarding each speech request that was submitted, pursuant to the Secretary’s voluntary ethics commitment.”

Hillary Clinton agreed before taking the job of secretary of state that all of the foundation’s foreign donations and Bill Clinton’s speaking requests would be reviewed by agency ethics officials to avoid any conflicts of interest. Questions about the foundation’s ties to foreign donors have dogged Hillary Clinton during her campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination.

The series of email chains released Tuesday by David Bossie’s group covers several months in 2012, when Mills served as chief of staff.

“Decline it,” was all she said in response to a May 18, 2012, email from Ami Desai, the Clinton Foundation’s director of foreign policy, who was asking whether Bill Clinton could accept an invitation in the rogue state of North Korea.

“This did not clear our internal vet, but [Bill] wants to know what state thinks of it if he took it 100 [percent] for the foundation,” Desai wrote. “We’d welcome your thoughts.”

There’s no indication Bill Clinton’s team ever approached State’s ethics office on these two invitations. He never gave the speeches.

A February analysis of hundreds of documents released to POLITICO under FOIA found that State lawyers acted on limited information about business proposals and speech requests and in some cases, seemed pressured to turn around answers on proposals quickly.

The documents sent to the State legal adviser’s office almost never included dollar figures for proposed speeches, though those amounts seemed to be readily shared with Hillary Clinton’s top staff.

State also told POLITICO earlier this year that State’s ethics officials sometimes consulted Hillary Clinton’s top advisers “as a practical matter” during the independent review process for Bill Clinton’s lucrative global appearances. At the time it was unclear exactly who they were consulting — though, even then, Mills was copied on most requests.

The Citizens United emails show Mills living up to her reputation as one of the few advisers willing to tell the Clintons “no.”

Oftentimes, other top Clinton staffers were copied on the foundation’s requests with Mills, including Huma Abedin, her deputy chief of staff-turned-vice chairwoman of her 2016 presidential campaign; Jake Sullivan, her top policy guru at State and on the campaign trail; and Michael Fuchs, a special adviser to Clinton at State who now serves as a deputy assistant secretary for strategy and multilateral affairs in one of the Asia bureaus.

All three were also copied on a June 11, 2012, email in which Desai asked whether the U.S. government would have concerns about Bill Clinton doing a $200,000 paid speech at a China energy summit in California later that month. They were concerned that they did not have enough information about the company serving as lead sponsor.

“Don Walker is concerned about the host and agrees with us it’s strange we can’t get any more information on this host and they have no track record of prior events,” Desai wrote, referring to Clinton’s speaking engagement booker. “We’d welcome your thoughts.”

That company, Luca International, is currently under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to CNN reports.

Mills often seemed to have the final say.

“No attendance by our ambo,” she wrote to Desai on Sept. 26, 2012, when he asked whether U.S. Ambassador to Burma Derek J. Mitchell could attend an event with President Thein Sein of Myanmar and Bill Clinton.

For the former president’s trip to Africa, Mills received a July 7, 2012, email from Johnnie Carson, assistant secretary of state for the bureau of African affairs, saying U.S. embassies in that region “see no … problems with their host governments or otherwise with President Clinton’s visit to Uganda and South Africa two/three weeks before the Secretary.”

“Can you check the facts — seems odd they would ship oil to Iran. Either way, is your point that they do business without a waiver?” Mills asked.

But she also gave a surprising answer when asked why : Her hands are tied , she said .
Amid complaints from lawmakers that no government official has really been held accountable for missteps in the run-up to the attack , Clinton claimed current federal regulations limit what disciplinary actions can be taken .
The sticking point appears to be what constitutes a `` breach of duty , '' which is the threshold for action . Whether it turns out the secretary has more leeway , lawmakers expressed a keen interest Thursday in changing the law .
`` I 'm sure that Congress will work on this important issue so that those held responsible for ignoring repeated requests for more security will not continue to enjoy their paid vacations , which is what administrative leave with salary is , '' Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen , R-Fla. , former chairwoman of the Foreign Affairs Committee , said in a statement to FoxNews.com .
Ros-Lehtinen said her understanding is that department lawyers determined the review board `` did not cite the correct causes that would have allowed such disciplinary action . ''
The congresswoman pointedly questioned Clinton on Wednesday during a House hearing about the four employees who were supposedly punished after a long-awaited report on the Sept. 11 attack was released late last year . She accused the department of doing `` nothing to correct the record '' when media reported at the time that department officials were being held accountable .
`` There 's just been a shuffling of the deck chairs , '' Ros-Lehtinen said .
Clinton confirmed that , while four individuals were `` removed from their jobs , '' three of those employees who were placed on administrative leave are still on leave and being paid .
The New York Post reported last month that the fourth , Assistant Secretary of State Eric Boswell , resigned from his position but not the department . The State Department has not disputed that .
But Clinton claimed Wednesday that `` we have taken every step that is available . ''
`` Under federal statute and regulations , unsatisfactory leadership is not grounds for finding a breach of duty , '' she said . `` And the ( review board ) did not find that these four individuals breached their duty . ''
Clinton was referring to the findings of the Accountability Review Board , which said `` certain senior State Department officials within two bureaus in critical positions ... demonstrated a lack of proactive leadership and management ability appropriate for the State Department 's senior ranks . ''
The board , though , said it did not find any employees `` engaged in misconduct or willfully ignored his or her responsibilities , and , therefore did not find reasonable cause to believe that an individual breached his or her duty so as to be the subject of a recommendation for disciplinary action . ''
That language is important , because of the rules laid out by the Omnibus Diplomatic and Antiterrorism Act of 1986 .
According to the law , an accountability review board can recommend disciplinary action if it believes someone has `` breached the duty of that individual . ''
As the Libya board explained , though , `` poor performance '' does not necessarily `` constitute a breach of duty '' that could lead to disciplinary action .
The board recommended a change . In the Libya report , the board said the `` unsatisfactory leadership performance '' at issue `` should be a potential basis for discipline recommendations by future ARBs '' -- and recommended the department regulations be changed .
Clinton , too , said she was submitting legislation to `` fix this problem . ''
`` Because I agree with you , '' she said . `` There ought to be more leeway . ''
`` I come from industry . I come from government . And there are individuals that just have to be cut loose when they 're not performing their tasks , '' Rep. Tom Marino , R-Pa. , told Clinton on Wednesday . `` What 's the hold-up from a management perspective of saying , ` You three let me down , this should have been brought to my attention . I no longer need your services ? ' ''","Secretary of State Hillary Clinton confirmed this week that several employees who were ""removed"" from their positions in the wake of the Libya terror attack are still being paid and have not actually left her department.

She accused the department of doing ""nothing to correct the record"" when media reported at the time that department officials were being held accountable.

""There's just been a shuffling of the deck chairs,"" Ros-Lehtinen said.

Clinton confirmed that, while four individuals were ""removed from their jobs,"" three of those employees who were placed on administrative leave are still on leave and being paid.

The New York Post reported last month that the fourth, Assistant Secretary of State Eric Boswell, resigned from his position but not the department. The State Department has not disputed that.

But Clinton claimed Wednesday that ""we have taken every step that is available.""

""Under federal statute and regulations, unsatisfactory leadership is not grounds for finding a breach of duty,"" she said. ""And the (review board) did not find that these four individuals breached their duty.""

Clinton was referring to the findings of the Accountability Review Board, which said ""certain senior State Department officials within two bureaus in critical positions ... demonstrated a lack of proactive leadership and management ability appropriate for the State Department's senior ranks.""

The board, though, said it did not find any employees ""engaged in misconduct or willfully ignored his or her responsibilities, and, therefore did not find reasonable cause to believe that an individual breached his or her duty so as to be the subject of a recommendation for disciplinary action.""

That language is important, because of the rules laid out by the Omnibus Diplomatic and Antiterrorism Act of 1986.

According to the law, an accountability review board can recommend disciplinary action if it believes someone has ""breached the duty of that individual.""

As the Libya board explained, though, ""poor performance"" does not necessarily ""constitute a breach of duty"" that could lead to disciplinary action.

The board recommended a change. In the Libya report, the board said the ""unsatisfactory leadership performance"" at issue ""should be a potential basis for discipline recommendations by future ARBs"" -- and recommended the department regulations be changed.

Clinton, too, said she was submitting legislation to ""fix this problem.""

""Because I agree with you,"" she said. ""There ought to be more leeway.""

Lawmakers were nevertheless dubious.

""I come from industry. I come from government. And there are individuals that just have to be cut loose when they're not performing their tasks,"" Rep. Tom Marino, R-Pa., told Clinton on Wednesday. ""What's the hold-up from a management perspective of saying, `You three let me down, this should have been brought to my attention. I no longer need your services?'''",www.foxnews.com,right,i6JVYBzFfKaAO0xQ
