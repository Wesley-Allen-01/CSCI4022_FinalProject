Since the election of Donald Trump as the 45th president of the United States of America , liberals have been looking for someone or something to blame . In the midst of much handwringing , fake news , and social media ’ s role in spreading it , has been identified as a culprit , with one underlying premise being that conservatives are more liable to be caught in the net of fake news due to their ideological rather than fact-based media consumption habits .
“ Fake stories about Hillary Clinton being a murderer emerged from a long legacy of right-wing media that has long pushed against established norms of journalism to spread fear and distrust , ” wrote Vox ’ s Jason Mittell and Chuck Tryon . “ Fake news has always been much more of an issue for conservatives , ” argued Salon ’ s Matthew Sheffield , citing Cold War-era right-wing conspiracy theorizing . The New Republic ’ s Jeet Heer , meanwhile , wrote that the real problem was not the fake news itself , but the “ partisan appetite for validating narratives that caused the spike in popularity for fake news , ” specifically the motivated reading of those on the right . And one of the biggest proliferators of fake news told the Washington Post that he specifically targeted Trump voters because he felt they were more gullible . He ’ s not alone : A BuzzFeed analysis found that 38 percent of posts from three large right-wing politics pages featured “ false or misleading information , ” compared to 20 percent from three large left-wing pages .
So , yes , conservatives have a serious fake news problem . And the spread of false stories that were damaging to Hillary Clinton and good for Donald Trump likely had a damaging impact on our democratic process . However . In the weeks since Trump won , as petitions and various other attempts to overturn the results of the election have taken over many a Facebook feed , it has become increasingly clear that the right wing does not have a monopoly on believing things that aren ’ t true .
Green Party candidate Jill Stein has raised at least $ 6.2 million for a doomed recount effort in three critical Electoral College states . She ’ s done this by feeding into the theory that the election might have been hacked by Russians or other nefarious actors—a claim for which there is no direct evidence . A report by New York Magazine ’ s Gabriel Sherman airing the claims of a group of computer scientists and election lawyers who believe the election may have been tampered with spread like wildfire on liberal Facebook last week , prompting further calls for a recount . That group ’ s circumstantial proof was quickly debunked . And while there are good governance reasons to do a paper recount , even the academic being cited by Stein in her court filings has said he thinks it ’ s unlikely the election was hacked . The Obama administration—which has more to gain from a Clinton presidency than just about anyone—has said , “ we stand behind our election results , which accurately reflect the will of the American people. ” But that hasn ’ t slowed down the movement for a recount .
Liberals were actually primed for this brand of foolishness throughout the primary season by Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders , who tacitly encouraged his supporters to believe that the primary vote had been “ rigged ” for Hillary . “ It seems that there ’ s been a lot of voter disenfranchisement and maybe some unsavory numbers , ” one Bernie supporter told me on California primary day back in June , echoing the sentiments of many with whom I spoke .
The left , of course , had been willing and able to buy ideological pleasing falsehoods long before Bernie . Just one example : In its right-wing fake news critique , Vox called out “ Infowars , the fearmongering media empire of Trump ally Alex Jones , where right-wing conspiracies flourish and leak into public consciousness via affirmations by other right-wing media and , now , the president-elect. ” What Vox failed to mention is that Jones made his name by creating the myth that a Republican administration was behind the 9/11 attacks . More on the left than you would hope bought this tripe . According to one 2007 Zogby poll , about 40 percent of liberals said they believed that the government either perpetrated the attack or “ let it happen . ”
Conservatives don ’ t even have a monopoly on being fooled by propaganda . As the Washington Post reported last week , one organization has started to catalogue the worst media offenders in disseminating anti-western Russian propaganda that has proliferated from Putin-sponsored media organs like Russia Today . Many of the offenders called out as “ useful idiots ” for picking up on and spreading this propaganda are alternative media sites with a left-wing bent like Naked Capitalism , Black Agenda Report , Consortium News , Truthdig , and Truth Out . ( Some alternative media outlets have pushed back against the claim that some among them are witlessly spreading Russian disinformation . )
And then there was the story of Ivanka Trump saying she would mace her leering father if he weren ’ t her father , which spread among the left over Thanksgiving weekend . After Trump ’ s disgusting comments about women , and the persistent leftwing fantasy that Ivanka will one day reveal herself to be better than the rest of her family , it was all too easy for Trump-haters to believe the mace story to be true . Only , it wasn ’ t .","Protestors demonstrate against President-elect Donald Trump November 13, 2016 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Mark Makela

She’s done this by feeding into the theory that the election might have been hacked by Russians or other nefarious actors—a claim for which there is no direct evidence. A report by New York Magazine’s Gabriel Sherman airing the claims of a group of computer scientists and election lawyers who believe the election may have been tampered with spread like wildfire on liberal Facebook last week, prompting further calls for a recount. That group’s circumstantial proof was quickly debunked. And while there are good governance reasons to do a paper recount, even the academic being cited by Stein in her court filings has said he thinks it’s unlikely the election was hacked. The Obama administration—which has more to gain from a Clinton presidency than just about anyone—has said, “we stand behind our election results, which accurately reflect the will of the American people.” But that hasn’t slowed down the movement for a recount.

Liberals were actually primed for this brand of foolishness throughout the primary season by Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders, who tacitly encouraged his supporters to believe that the primary vote had been “rigged” for Hillary. “It seems that there’s been a lot of voter disenfranchisement and maybe some unsavory numbers,” one Bernie supporter told me on California primary day back in June, echoing the sentiments of many with whom I spoke.

The left, of course, had been willing and able to buy ideological pleasing falsehoods long before Bernie. Just one example: In its right-wing fake news critique, Vox called out “Infowars, the fearmongering media empire of Trump ally Alex Jones, where right-wing conspiracies flourish and leak into public consciousness via affirmations by other right-wing media and, now, the president-elect.” What Vox failed to mention is that Jones made his name by creating the myth that a Republican administration was behind the 9/11 attacks. More on the left than you would hope bought this tripe. According to one 2007 Zogby poll, about 40 percent of liberals said they believed that the government either perpetrated the attack or “let it happen.”

Conservatives don’t even have a monopoly on being fooled by propaganda. As the Washington Post reported last week, one organization has started to catalogue the worst media offenders in disseminating anti-western Russian propaganda that has proliferated from Putin-sponsored media organs like Russia Today. Many of the offenders called out as “useful idiots” for picking up on and spreading this propaganda are alternative media sites with a left-wing bent like Naked Capitalism, Black Agenda Report, Consortium News, Truthdig, and Truth Out. (Some alternative media outlets have pushed back against the claim that some among them are witlessly spreading Russian disinformation.)

And then there was the story of Ivanka Trump saying she would mace her leering father if he weren’t her father, which spread among the left over Thanksgiving weekend. After Trump’s disgusting comments about women, and the persistent leftwing fantasy that Ivanka will one day reveal herself to be better than the rest of her family, it was all too easy for Trump-haters to believe the mace story to be true. Only, it wasn’t.",www.slate.com,left,vqCH5ssYp0CkRuXc

His crowning achievement at Fox News, however, was sullied in his final months by the charges of sexual misconduct. Twenty-First Century Fox noted in a recent quarterly report that it paid $45 million in settlements related to sexual harassment allegations against Ailes.

Carlson alleged at least six conditions in which Ailes referred to her body, intimidated her or used demeaning language. At least a half-dozen other women, including former Fox News star Megyn Kelly, came forward to accuse Ailes, who denied wrongdoing.

A miniseries about Ailes, titled Secure and Hold: The Last Days of Roger Ailes, was already in the works at Showtime, based in part of Sherman's book.

The authors omitted the fact that the alleged victim has no memory of the alleged incident .
If you opened Twitter on Sunday morning , you were likely greeted with the bombshell headline of the top trending news story : “ NYT reporters ’ book details new sexual assault allegation against Brett Kavanaugh . ”
The allegation , Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly write in a New York Times story adapted from their forthcoming anti-Kavanaugh book , is this : “ We also uncovered a previously unreported story about Mr. Kavanaugh in his freshman year that echoes Ms. Ramirez ’ s allegation . A classmate , Max Stier , saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party , where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student . ”
Kavanaugh ’ s “ friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student ” ?
Can someone explain the logistics of the allegation here ? Was Kavanaugh allegedly walking around naked when his friends pushed him into the female student ?
No , if I ’ m reading Pogrebin and Kelly right , the friends didn ’ t push Kavanaugh in the back . Rather , the “ friends pushed his penis . ”
What ? How does that happen ? Who are the friends ? Who is the female student ? Were there any witnesses besides Stier ?
All that the authors write in the New York Times essay about corroborating the story is this : “ Mr . Stier , who runs a nonprofit organization in Washington , notified senators and the F.B.I . about this account , but the F.B.I . did not investigate and Mr. Stier has declined to discuss it publicly . ( We corroborated the story with two officials who have communicated with Mr . Stier . ) ”
So they corroborated the fact that Stier made the allegation to the FBI , but the authors give no indication that they have corroborated any details of the alleged incident .
The book isn ’ t released until Tuesday , but Mollie Hemingway got a copy , and she writes on Twitter : “ The book notes , quietly , that the woman Max Stier named as having been supposedly victimized by Kavanaugh and friends denies any memory of the alleged event. ” Omitting this fact from the New York Times story is one of the worst cases of journalistic malpractice in recent memory .
If you take this confusing accusation in the essay at face value , it doesn ’ t even appear to be an allegation of assault against Kavanaugh .
If Kavanaugh ’ s “ friends pushed his penis , ” then isn ’ t it an allegation of wrongdoing against Kavanaugh ’ s “ friends , ” not Kavanaugh himself ? Surely even a modern liberal Yalie who ’ s been to one of those weird non-sexual “ naked parties ” would recognize both the female student and Kavanaugh are both alleged victims in this alleged incident , barring an additional allegation that a college-aged Kavanaugh asked his “ friends ” to “ push his penis . ”
The new allegation is supposed to help lend credence to the on-the-record allegation that Kavanaugh ’ s Yale classmate Deborah Ramirez made in 2018 . Pogrebin and Kelly sum up Ramirez ’ s allegation : “ She and some classmates had been drinking heavily when , she says , a freshman named Brett Kavanaugh pulled down his pants and thrust his penis at her , prompting her to swat it away and inadvertently touch it . Some of the onlookers , who had been passing around a fake penis earlier in the evening , laughed . ”
Pogrebin and Kelly downplay Ramirez ’ s own doubts about whether Kavanaugh did what she now alleges , choosing rather to lard up their New York Times story with details that are supposed to demonstrate how under-privileged Ramirez was : She had to sell ice cream during the summer in high school , bought a cheap car , and only had an above-ground swimming pool as a teenager ( the horror ) .
None of these details corroborates her accusation against Kavanaugh . But the story is framed to make it seem like Kavanaugh was the type of privileged jerk who might expose himself in front of an under-privileged college classmate .
As I wrote last October , here ’ s why Ramirez ’ s allegation was dubious :
Deborah Ramirez is the Yale classmate of Kavanaugh ’ s who now claims that Kavanaugh exposed himself as a college freshman at a party . Ramirez ’ s claim was already dubious because ( 1 ) named eyewitnesses deny the allegation and ( 2 ) Ramirez herself wasn ’ t sure in recent weeks if Kavanaugh had done what she now alleges . “ Ms . Ramirez herself contacted former Yale classmates asking if they recalled the incident and told some of them that she could not be certain Mr. Kavanaugh was the one who exposed himself , ” the New York Times reported . Ramirez was only willing to make the allegation , the New Yorker reported , after “ six days of carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorney . ”
Pogrebin and Kelly write that a couple of students say they had heard about the alleged incident in the days after it allegedly occurred , but the authors provide no indication there is any first-hand witness to corroborate the allegation .
We already knew before Kavanaugh was confirmed last October that the “ corroborating ” source for Ramirez ’ s claim , classmate Kenneth Appold , was not present when the alleged incident occurred , but Appold told the New Yorker he was “ one-hundred-percent-sure ” he heard about it from an eyewitness . Shortly before Kavanaugh was confirmed , the New Yorker reported that Appold ’ s supposed eyewitness “ said that he had no memory of the incident . ”
Maybe Pogrebin and Kelly ’ s book is stronger than their essay . But I ’ m skeptical . “ In the end they turn up no smoking gun , ” Hanna Rosin writes in her New York Times review of the book .

Wait a second. Who did what to whom?

Kavanaugh’s “friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student”?

We 're just gaming the refs , they say . Someone 's always bitching about the media , they say . Whatever helps them sleep at night , I suppose .

This is how elections are tilted toward despots and undisciplined strongmen . They 're legitimized and humanized despite their long menu of unprecedented gaffes , lies and treachery .
For some time now , I 've been attempting to define the specific differences in the political press ' coverage of Clinton and the coverage of Trump . There are several underlying factors at work here . But the broad stroke imbalance is specifically due to the fact that the news media is evaluating Clinton based on pre-2016 political rules , while Trump has been operating under his all-new 2016 political rules . And the press has mostly sanctioned those rules .
Put another way : Clinton 's triumphs and gaffes are being observed and reported through what we 've all come to know as canon for presidential campaigns in the modern era . Candidates running for president , prior to the ascendance of Trump , have always been expected to do and say certain things in order to successfully participate .
For example , candidates are expected release their tax returns . They 're expected to speak using a particularly even-keeled tone of voice . They 're expected to hold a few press conferences along the way . They 're expected to shift to a more centrist posture for the general election . They 're expected to behave in a way that wo n't offend minorities and mainstream Americans alike .
If they deviate from any of these rules ( and there are many other rules and traditions ) they 're pilloried by cable news talkers and political reporters who are career motivated to feed dramatic beef to the ratings beast .
Meanwhile , Trump has mostly rejected the rules , despite his recent embrace of teleprompters . As a matter of routine , he tramples the pre-2016 rules multiple times a day — not just minor glitches , but words and actions that , according to those rules , would have collapsed his numbers if not driven him out of the race entirely , as it has with so many candidates before .
But because he managed to win the nomination and is polling within the margin of error against Hillary , due to the existence of `` liberal media bias '' and the fact that the press desperately needs as much conflict and uncertainty as possible to remain competitive , he 's allowed to skate by without being held to the same pre-2016 rules as his opponents . That 's his opponents plural , including his Republican primary opponents who were also held to old-school , pre-2016 standards of behavior .
Clinton was almost universally criticized for failing to disclose her pneumonia diagnosis for two whole days . Her dizzy spell during the 9/11 commemoration ceremony was treated with `` Special Reports '' that broke into regular programming , with endless conga lines of political analysts rending garments over why , oh why she never tells them anything and whether her temporary illness would end her campaign and deliver the presidency to Trump .
As a direct consequence , Clinton 's numbers have continued to dip , while Trump 's numbers are undeservedly surging . Again , she 's been held to rules established in 2004 , 2008 and 2012 about health disclosures and transparency , even though she released full medical records 13 months ago no less , from reputable doctors in accordance with how all presidential candidates have done it in the modern era .
Imagine for a moment if Clinton adopted Trump 's behavior and crapped all over the pre-2016 rules upon which her campaign is being evaluated ? Cable news people could n't scramble to a television camera fast enough to declare her candidacy over . That would be the kind part . It 'd be quickly followed by Day 2 stories about how Clinton has lost her mind . Trump , on the other hand , gets away with this every damn day — literally .
What about Trump ? Unlike Clinton , he 's yet to fully disclose his medical history ( or his tax returns ) . Instead , he initially released a letter from a kooky doctor who looks like a background character from `` The Simpsons . '' Both Trump and the doctor , Dr. Harold Bornstein , insisted that the obviously suspicious letter accurately described the Republican nominee 's medical condition , including the part about being `` the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency . '' Sorry , that 's total bullshit .
Months later , Dr. Bornstein confessed to NBC News that he wrote the letter in five minutes based on Trump 's directives while he waited outside in his limo . Making matters even worse , Trump released a second letter on Thursday , also composed by Dr. Bornstein , via the disreputable Dr. Oz television show ( another violation of pre-2016 rules ) , and predictably it was almost as bogus as the first one .
Trump 's weight was reported as significantly lower than it actually is . Bornstein wrote that Trump weighs a relatively svelte 236 pounds , even though he appears to weigh closer to 300 . Likewise , Trump 's height jumped from 6 foot 2 to 6 foot 3 . It 's worth noting that according to the Centers For Disease Control , if Trump 's weight , 236 , is n't a lie , then a 6 foot 2 Trump would be categorized as `` obese '' by the CDC 's standards . But if he were to magically grow by an inch to 6 foot 3 , while remaining 236 pounds , then he slips into the less dire `` overweight '' classification . Convenient growth spurt for a 70-year-old man .
Am I overthinking Trump 's numbers ? Maybe . But , hell , no one in the traditional political press is investigating it , despite Trump 's long history of brazen mendacity and his previous history with suspicious Bornstein letters . Mark Halperin is n't looking into it . Neither is Chris Cillizza , Andrea Mitchell or Jake Tapper .
No one 's asking how Trump grew by an inch . No one 's asking how a 70-year-old man — a man who eats fast food because , as he laughably told Dr. Oz , he `` knows what 's in it '' — has a prostate specific antigen number , 0.15 nanoliter/microliter , that 's remarkably lower than the lowest end of the normal range for a white man his age . ( The normal range for a man of Trump 's age is zero to 6.5 nanoliter/microliter . )
Why is Trump getting away with this , while Clinton 's health and transparency was scrutinized and concern trolled for the better part of a week ?
There are different rules . Indeed , the reaction to Hillary 's pneumonia and dehydration episode would be fine if Trump 's hinky medical reports , as well as his obesity and everything else , were discussed through the same prism and with the same level of urgency . But his disclosures , on top of the laundry list of horrible blurts and ludicrous statements , are barely if ever scrutinized by anyone outside of three or four liberal-leaning MSNBC hosts , as well as an array of liberal blogs and social media personalities , very few of which reach the eyeballs of undecided voters .
We 'd be more sympathetic to a `` both sides '' equivalence in political coverage if the press actually held both candidates to the same set of pre-2016 rules — rules that have been applied to every candidate in every election year until Trump arrived on the scene . In doing so , however , the press would have to accept and own that Trump is a far worse violator of the rules than nearly all other presidential candidates combined . And the view from the outside would be that Trump is called on the carpet significantly more often , thus incurring the wrath of Trump supporters who continue to insist there 's a liberal media bias .
But it 's the avoidance of those accusations by the press , combined with the demand for horserace drama , that 's forced it to unfairly and dangerously apply separate rules to each candidate , egregiously offering Trump far more latitude than previous contenders .
To paraphrase Jon Stewart , it 's hurting America . And there 's no sign of stopping .","The only explanation for the lopsided coverage of the election by the political press so far is that, for some mysterious reason-defying logic, there's a ""false equivalence"" at work.

That's his opponents plural, including his Republican primary opponents who were also held to old-school, pre-2016 standards of behavior.

Clinton was almost universally criticized for failing to disclose her pneumonia diagnosis for two whole days. Her dizzy spell during the 9/11 commemoration ceremony was treated with ""Special Reports"" that broke into regular programming, with endless conga lines of political analysts rending garments over why, oh why she never tells them anything and whether her temporary illness would end her campaign and deliver the presidency to Trump.

As a direct consequence, Clinton's numbers have continued to dip, while Trump's numbers are undeservedly surging. Again, she's been held to rules established in 2004, 2008 and 2012 about health disclosures and transparency, even though she released full medical records 13 months ago no less, from reputable doctors in accordance with how all presidential candidates have done it in the modern era.

Imagine for a moment if Clinton adopted Trump's behavior and crapped all over the pre-2016 rules upon which her campaign is being evaluated? Cable news people couldn't scramble to a television camera fast enough to declare her candidacy over. That would be the kind part. It'd be quickly followed by Day 2 stories about how Clinton has lost her mind. Trump, on the other hand, gets away with this every damn day — literally.

What about Trump? Unlike Clinton, he's yet to fully disclose his medical history (or his tax returns). Instead, he initially released a letter from a kooky doctor who looks like a background character from ""The Simpsons."" Both Trump and the doctor, Dr. Harold Bornstein, insisted that the obviously suspicious letter accurately described the Republican nominee's medical condition, including the part about being ""the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency."" Sorry, that's total bullshit.

Months later, Dr. Bornstein confessed to NBC News that he wrote the letter in five minutes based on Trump's directives while he waited outside in his limo. Making matters even worse, Trump released a second letter on Thursday, also composed by Dr. Bornstein, via the disreputable Dr. Oz television show (another violation of pre-2016 rules), and predictably it was almost as bogus as the first one.

Trump's weight was reported as significantly lower than it actually is. Bornstein wrote that Trump weighs a relatively svelte 236 pounds, even though he appears to weigh closer to 300. Likewise, Trump's height jumped from 6 foot 2 to 6 foot 3. It's worth noting that according to the Centers For Disease Control, if Trump's weight, 236, isn't a lie, then a 6 foot 2 Trump would be categorized as ""obese"" by the CDC's standards. But if he were to magically grow by an inch to 6 foot 3, while remaining 236 pounds, then he slips into the less dire ""overweight"" classification. Convenient growth spurt for a 70-year-old man.

Am I overthinking Trump's numbers? Maybe. But, hell, no one in the traditional political press is investigating it, despite Trump's long history of brazen mendacity and his previous history with suspicious Bornstein letters. Mark Halperin isn't looking into it. Neither is Chris Cillizza, Andrea Mitchell or Jake Tapper.

No one's asking how Trump grew by an inch. No one's asking how a 70-year-old man — a man who eats fast food because, as he laughably told Dr. Oz, he ""knows what's in it"" — has a prostate specific antigen number, 0.15 nanoliter/microliter, that's remarkably lower than the lowest end of the normal range for a white man his age. (The normal range for a man of Trump's age is zero to 6.5 nanoliter/microliter.)

Why is Trump getting away with this, while Clinton's health and transparency was scrutinized and concern trolled for the better part of a week?

There are different rules. Indeed, the reaction to Hillary's pneumonia and dehydration episode would be fine if Trump's hinky medical reports, as well as his obesity and everything else, were discussed through the same prism and with the same level of urgency. But his disclosures, on top of the laundry list of horrible blurts and ludicrous statements, are barely if ever scrutinized by anyone outside of three or four liberal-leaning MSNBC hosts, as well as an array of liberal blogs and social media personalities, very few of which reach the eyeballs of undecided voters.

We'd be more sympathetic to a ""both sides"" equivalence in political coverage if the press actually held both candidates to the same set of pre-2016 rules — rules that have been applied to every candidate in every election year until Trump arrived on the scene. In doing so, however, the press would have to accept and own that Trump is a far worse violator of the rules than nearly all other presidential candidates combined. And the view from the outside would be that Trump is called on the carpet significantly more often, thus incurring the wrath of Trump supporters who continue to insist there's a liberal media bias.

But it's the avoidance of those accusations by the press, combined with the demand for horserace drama, that's forced it to unfairly and dangerously apply separate rules to each candidate, egregiously offering Trump far more latitude than previous contenders.

That is somewhat smaller than the share who were following news about the presidential candidates a few months ago , and substantially smaller than the share now following news about the COVID-19 outbreak .
With Election Day six months away , 52 % of Americans are paying fairly close or very close attention to news about the presidential candidates , according to a ███ survey conducted April 20-26 as part of the American News Pathways project . Back in a Feb. 18-March 2 survey , a modestly larger share ( 59 % ) said they were following news about the candidates fairly closely or very closely . That period included the South Carolina Democratic primary , which appears to have been a turning point for Joe Biden ’ s presidential campaign .
Both measures are somewhat lower than a similar measure asked on the phone in April 2016 , when 69 % of Americans reported that they were following candidate news at least fairly closely . But all these figures are far smaller than the overwhelming majority of Americans ( 87 % ) who say they are following news about the coronavirus outbreak fairly closely or very closely , according to the April survey . The findings underscore the extent to which the pandemic has come to dominate media coverage and public attention .
How we did this This analysis of how closely Americans are following news about the presidential candidates is based on a survey of 10,139 U.S. adults conducted April 20 to 26 , 2020 . Everyone who took part in the survey is a member of ███ ’ s American Trends Panel , an online survey panel that is recruited through national , random sampling of residential addresses .

To further ensure that each survey reflects a balanced cross section of the nation , the data is weighted to match the U.S. adult population by gender , race , ethnicity , partisan affiliation , education and other categories . Here are the questions asked in this survey , along with responses , and the methodology .
There is little or no difference in the level of interest in COVID-19 news by gender or race and ethnicity ( though older adults are more likely to follow COVID-19 news than younger adults ) . But when it comes to following news about the 2020 candidates , some demographic differences are considerably more pronounced .
A higher percentage of men ( 58 % ) than women ( 45 % ) are following candidate news very or fairly closely . Women are nearly twice as likely as men ( 20 % vs. 12 % ) to say they are following candidate news not at all closely .
White adults are somewhat more likely to be following candidate news fairly or very closely ( 56 % ) than black adults ( 47 % ) and considerably more likely to be doing so than Hispanic adults ( 38 % ) . Hispanic adults are nearly twice as likely to say they are following candidate news not at all closely as very closely ( 24 % vs. 13 % ) .
The level of engagement with candidate news increases steadily with age , a pattern seen in previous research about news more generally . Among those ages 18 to 29 , 39 % are following news about the candidates very or fairly closely . The percentage rises to 46 % among those ages 30 to 49 , 57 % among those ages 50 to 64 and around two-thirds ( 66 % ) of those 65 and older . Americans 65 and older are more than twice as likely as those 18 to 29 to say they are following candidate news very closely ( 30 % vs. 12 % ) .
In the new survey , differences by gender , race , ethnicity and age are similar to those in the Feb. 18-March 2 survey . But in nearly all these demographic groups , the share of people who are fairly or very closely following candidate news has declined since February . One exception is among the youngest adults : In both surveys , 39 % of those ages 18 to 29 said they are paying fairly or very close attention to news about the candidates .
Americans not so interested in hearing from presidential campaigns themselves , many unsure whether primaries are over
The COVID-19 pandemic has deeply affected how the candidates conduct the 2020 presidential campaign . While President Donald Trump has the bully pulpit of the White House at his disposal , the outbreak has largely confined him to that building . And while Biden has tried different forms of outreach to voters , he has been effectively sequestered in his Delaware home .
When asked if it is personally important to receive messages and statements relating to the election and other important issues from the Trump and Biden campaigns themselves , fewer than half ( 44 % ) of Americans say it is very important or somewhat important . A slight majority ( 55 % ) say it is not too important or not at all important . In fact , more Americans say it is not at all important ( 24 % ) than say it is very important ( 18 % ) to hear messages from the campaigns .
Responses to this question again diverge by age . While 37 % of those ages 18 to 29 and 38 % of those ages 30 to 49 say it is it is very or somewhat important to get information from the campaigns , the share jumps to 58 % among those 65 and older .
Meanwhile , the U.S. public does not appear to be keeping close tabs on the Democratic primary calendar , which has shifted considerably in response to concerns about COVID-19 .

But it 's hard to imagine anything more scary than a rapidly mutating contagious killer disease pandemic that features all the worst symptoms of the flu until it culminates in bleeding from the eyes , ears , nose , mouth and rectum , the eyes swell shut , your genitals swell up , all of your skin hurts and you have a blood-filled rash all over your body . And then you die . In the panoply of things to be afraid of you 'd think everyone could acknowledge that this is the big one .
In an Op-Ed in the New York Times last week Michael T. Osterholm , the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota , laid out a potential scenario right out of a movies -- a horror movie . He discusses the very real potential that Ebola will make its move into the mega-cities of Africa , which will make it much more difficult to contain than it has been in previous outbreaks in the smaller villages .

You can now get Ebola only through direct contact with bodily fluids . But viruses like Ebola are notoriously sloppy in replicating , meaning the virus entering one person may be genetically different from the virus entering the next . The current Ebola virus ’ s hyper-evolution is unprecedented ; there has been more human-to-human transmission in the past four months than most likely occurred in the last 500 to 1,000 years . Each new infection represents trillions of throws of the genetic dice . If certain mutations occurred , it would mean that just breathing would put one at risk of contracting Ebola . Infections could spread quickly to every part of the globe , as the H1N1 influenza virus did in 2009 , after its birth in Mexico .

Kurtz: As media organizations cut expenses, they dilute quality of their product

In era of social media and commodity news, original reporting is vital, he says

The slow-motion shrinkage of the news business is driving away part of the public.

A Pew Research Center survey says that 31% of those questioned have deserted a particular news outlet because it no longer provides the kind of news and information they had come to expect. And they have noticed this despite the fact that six in 10 overall have heard little or nothing about the industry's financial woes.

Talk about cutting our own throats. This is the most depressing news we've heard about the news business in quite some time.

Who are these customers who are slipping away?

According to an annual report by Pew's Project for Excellence in Journalism, they are the wealthier, older, better-educated folks, more of them men, who are most likely to pay for news.

Welcome to the vicious cycle. As advertising declines, digital competition and other pressures have forced media executives to water down the soup, and now many patrons are noticing that it doesn't taste as good.

With so many media choices these days and with news becoming a commodity, it is hard to persuade the owners to invest in in-depth journalism. When a reporter digs up a scoop, it is aggregated and repackaged and diluted and snarked upon by a thousand websites that didn't pay a penny to produce it but can sell advertising off it.

Opinion sells, and doesn't require a costly chain of national and international bureaus. You just need some lights, cameras and microphones.

What's happening in cable news is a case in point.

MSNBC, the project says, is the most opinionated network by far. Some 85% of its daily programming is people offering opinions, which is cheaper to produce than reporting. On Fox News, by contrast, 55% of the air time is filled by opinion.

CNN is the only one to produce more reporting than commentary, 54% to 46%, says the report. But even at CNN, the report says, the number of packaged news reports in prime time dropped from 50% to 24% from 2007 to 2012, with more time devoted to interviews.

As for local TV newscasts, sports, weather and traffic soaked up 40% of airtime last year, up from 32% in 2005. And news reports are practically becoming blips: only 20% of stories lasted longer than a minute, while half took less than 30 seconds.

Not that everyone is sitting passively in front of a TV set these days; instead, people are walking the streets squinting at their phones. In the survey, 39% said they got news from a mobile device yesterday. The iPad era has fully arrived.

Another 19% say they got news from social media (along with 16% from e-mail and 8% from podcasts). It's not just that Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr and Pinterest are vibrant delivery systems. The sea change here is that folks are devouring information steered their way by family, friends and those they choose to follow.

As that balance of power shifts, media organizations are scrambling to adapt. They can no longer simply deliver the headlines from on high. They need ordinary folks to serve as their ambassadors, spreading the word about their journalism like the town criers of old.

The top news site by Facebook interactions is the Huffington Post, the study says, followed by London's Daily Mail, Yahoo and the BBC, before you get to the New York Times, the Guardian and CNN.com.

As I have previously reported , many within Fox News ’ s subterranean newsroom credited the younger Murdochs , still ubiquitously known as “ the Boys , ” for handling the crisis so expeditiously , and for pledging to sanitize Fox News ’ s culture . Ailes once said that the company was prepared to broadcast until the end of time , meaning up until the critical moment of a potential apocalypse or world war . In less than two weeks , however , he was out . The wooden door that famously cordoned his office suite from prying eyes was removed . Within , two handguns were discovered—one a Glock , the other a Smith & Wesson—with ammunition for both . ( “ Roger has a permit for those two guns , ” Ailes ’ s attorney , Susan Estrich , told me , adding that her client has a license to carry a handgun in New York , “ for his personal protection. ” She continued : “ Those guns are licensed and appropriate. ” Ailes has repeatedly denied all allegations of sexual harassment . )
Within the newsroom , according to one staffer , the days following Ailes ’ s departure were defined by “ shock and awe. ” But as Rupert Murdoch moved in to take over as interim C.E.O. , it seemed like the big boss was working in tandem with his heirs .

They also kept on Dianne Brandi , the general counsel , and Suzanne Scott , ‎executive vice president , programming and development . These moves seemed counter-intuitive to those who saw the younger Murdochs agitating for change .

As Gabriel Sherman detailed in New York , Luhn received a $ 3.15 million settlement .

James Murdoch was also troubled when he looked at the demographics of Fox’s aging audience. “Within Fox News, it’s a pretty old audience,” a person close to James recently told me. “And the country is evolving.” As the internal investigation began, the company presented Paul, Weiss lawyers with a list of women whom they should speak to, according to three people briefed on the matter.",www.vanityfair.com,left,x69h9hc0WodMy7k1

The tweet was gauche.

So Hogg called for a boycott on all her advertisers. That was, in and of itself, somewhat ridiculous — after all, this was by political standards a mild attack at best. It wasn’t a conspiracy theory, it wasn’t a “crisis actor” lie. It was a mean interpretation of an interview Hogg did with TMZ.

Hogg’s boycott was overkill. But advertisers dropped Ingraham’s show anyway, fearful of a public manipulated by the media to believe that anything said about Parkland survivors was some sort of dire breach of basic morality.

Then Ingraham apologized.

Problem solved, right? Lesson learned. Don’t say silly, mean things about Parkland survivors. But Hogg quickly rejected the apology, and called for an increased boycott on Ingraham and other Fox News hosts until they “stand down” and start acting “objective” — by which Hogg presumably means “until they start agreeing with all of my rhetoric and proposals.”

It has nothing to do with legislation or law enforcement.

And it doesn’t have anything to do with restoring civility to politics, either. Hogg has viciously attacked his political opponents over and over and over again.

So, what is this all about?

Demonization. Ingraham never should have tweeted what she did. But the advertiser boycott was overkill from the beginning, and it’s particularly overkill after she apologized. I started writing my syndicated column at 17 years old. The most popular nickname for me on the Left was “The Virgin Ben.” I was smacked about routinely.

As a Newsmax “ Insider ” columnist , he has thoughts about how Iraq needs to rid itself of Iranian influence to attract investment and why Dubai is an oasis of stability in a turbulent region . His career as a “ geopolitical risk consultant and interactive simulation designer ” and an “ international relations senior analyst ” for the Department of Labor have given him plenty of insights about the Middle East . He ’ s printed those insights at a range of conservative outlets like the Washington Examiner , RealClear Markets , American Thinker , and The National Interest .
Unfortunately for the outlets who published his articles and the readers who believed them , Raphael Badani does not exist .
His profile photos are stolen from the blog of an unwitting San Diego startup founder . His LinkedIn profile , which described him as a graduate of George Washington and Georgetown , is equally fictitious ( and was deleted following publication of this article ) .
Badani is part of a network of at least 19 fake personas that has spent the past year placing more than 90 opinion pieces in 46 different publications . The articles heaped praise on the United Arab Emirates and advocated for a tougher approach to Qatar , Turkey , Iran and its proxy groups in Iraq and Lebanon .
Human Events , meanwhile , also affixed an editor ’ s note atop their article written by a fake persona , but outright defended its publication , writing : “ We have reviewed the substance of this piece , and have not found any factual errors—and we still agree with the thesis of the piece . As such , we are keeping the piece up , and adopting its arguments as a publication . ”
Newsmax deleted all articles by “ Badani ” and scrubbed his profile page listing him as an “ insider ” —all without any editor ’ s notes . The Post Millennial , The Jerusalem Post , and The National Interest also deleted their articles without any statement . ( Yahoo News , which shared the National Interest ’ s story as part of a content share , said on Tuesday that they ’ ve deleted their iteration of the article and “ are investigating and will take the necessary action with our partner to prevent this from happening in the future . ” )
On Monday , Twitter suspended Badani ’ s account along with 15 others after The ███ shared the results of its investigation into the network for violating the company ’ s “ policies on platform manipulation and spam . ”
“ Using technology , human review , and partnerships with researchers and other independent organizations studying these issues , we work to identify platform manipulation on our service and take action , ” a Twitter spokesperson told The ███ in a statement . “ As is standard , if we have reasonable evidence to attribute any activity to a state-backed information operation , we ’ ll disclose them—following thorough investigation—to our public archive . ”
“ This vast influence operation highlights the ease with which malicious actors can exploit the identity of real people , dupe international news outlets , and have propaganda of unknown provenance legitimized through reputable media , ” Marc Owen Jones , an assistant professor at Hamad Bin Khalifa University in Qatar who first noticed suspicious posts by members of the network , told The ███ . “ It ’ s not just fake news we need to be wary of , but fake journalists . ”
The network ’ s spree of hot takes targeted a range of publications and placed articles critical of Qatar and supportive of tougher sanctions on Iran in conservative North American outlets like Human Events and The Post Millennial , founded by conservative writer Andy Ngo , as well as Israeli and Middle Eastern newspapers like The Jerusalem Post and Al Arabiya , and Asian newspapers like the South China Morning Post .
Tying the network together is a series of shared behavioral patterns . The personas identified by The ███ were generally contributors to two linked sites , The Arab Eye and Persia Now ( which , following this article ’ s publication , have both been entirely deleted ) ; had Twitter accounts created in March or April 2020 ; presented themselves as political consultants and freelance journalists mostly based in European capitals ; lied about their academic or professional credentials in phony LinkedIn accounts ; used fake or stolen avatars manipulated to defeat reverse image searches ; and linked to or amplified each others ’ work .
The earliest posts from personas in the network date back to July 2019 and were authored by Lin Nguyen , a fake “ analyst in South Asian regional security , ” according to her author biography . Nguyen and another persona , Cindy Xi , wrote mostly on East Asian issues , particularly how Hong Kong ’ s economy was faring under the coronavirus pandemic .
But the network soon grew and expanded its focus towards the Middle East . In February , two websites , The Arab Eye and Persia Now , were registered on the same day and began to acquire a host of contributors .
The Arab Eye describes itself , ironically enough , as a bulwark against “ ‘ Fake News ’ and biased narrative ” with a mission that “ now more than ever it is crucial to hear opinions from the other side of the aisle on matters pertaining to the Middle East . ”
The sites may not appear to be linked to the outside observer but a search of the RiskIQ database shows both sites share the same Google Analytics account , are hosted at the same IP address , and are linked through a series of shared encryption certificates .
Like the majority of their contributors , the sites themselves appear to be fake .
Persia Now lists a non-existent London mailing address and an unanswered phone number on its contact form . The apparent editors of the outlets , Sharif O ’ Neill and Taimur Hall , have virtually no online footprints or records in journalism .
At Persia Now , The Arab Eye , and across dozens of other publications , the fake contributors have adopted similar themes in their opinion pieces . They ’ re critical of Qatar and , in particular , its state-funded news outlet Al Jazeera . They ’ re no big fans of Turkey ’ s role backing one of the factions in Libya ’ s civil war and have called it “ bad news , ” aimed at “ constricting the flow of vital energy resources ” to Europe , and “ driving a wedge between and “ dividing NATO . ”
There are constant editorial lines like arguing for more sanctions on Iran or using international leverage to weaken Iran ’ s proxy groups in Lebanon and Iraq . The personas are also big fans of the United Arab Emirates and have heaped praise on the Gulf nation for its “ exemplary resilience ” to the COVID-19 pandemic , its “ strong diplomatic ties ” to the European Union , and supposedly supporting gender equality through the Expo 2020 in Dubai .
More recently , the personas have taken up the cause of criticizing Facebook for its decision to appoint Tawakkol Karman , a 2011 Nobel Peace Prize laureate , to its oversight board . Media outlets in Saudi Arabia , Egypt , and the United Arab Emirates have criticized the appointment of Karman , a former member of the Muslim Brotherhood affiliated Islah Party in Yemen , for her association with the group .
In pieces for the Jewish News Syndicate ( which has since been deleted without explanation ) , Asia Times , Politcalite , and Middle East Online , the network cast Karman as a “ nefarious political actor with a questionable past ” who will make Facebook the “ platform of choice for extreme Islamist ideology . ”
None of the Twitter accounts associated with the network ever passed more than a few dozen followers , but a few still managed to garner high profile endorsements for their work . An article by “ Joyce Toledano ” in Human Events about how Qatar is “ destabilizing the Middle East ” got a shout-out from Students for Trump co-founder Ryan Fournier ’ s nearly million-follower Twitter account . French senator Nathalie Goulet high-fived Lin Nguyen ’ s broadside about Facebook and Tawakkol Karman ( when informed of The ███ ’ s reporting , the lawmaker replied : “ Easy to tell after but thanks I will be careful . ”
The personas in the network used a mixture of stolen or AI-generated avatars and fake biographies to make them seem more plausible .
The “ Raphael Badani ” Twitter account used Barry Dadon , a real San Diego businessman and startup founder , as a source for its profile photos . Without his knowledge or consent , the account owner took a photo from Dadon ’ s blog for a Twitter profile photo and stole a picture from the Facebook page of Dadon ’ s wife for the Badani Newsmax columnist page .
“ Mikael Virtanen , ” a fake Finnish businessman who wrote about the Middle East for the Jewish News Service , stole his avatar from a free image database . Other avatars were stolen from a Vietnam analyst at a Singapore financial consulting firm and a California insurance agent .
All of the stolen avatars were mirror image reversed and cropped from their originals , making them difficult to find through common Google reverse image searches .
The fake contributors also appear to have used AI-generated avatars for a handful of their personas . A high-resolution profile photo of the Joseph Labba persona , posted for an article at The Post Millennial , shows some of the telltale glitches commonly found in AI-generated faces . The left ear is oddly smooth without any ear lobe creases . Middlebury Institute of International Studies research associate Sam Meyer reviewed the photo of Labba using imagery analysis software and also noticed he appears to have three misfit teeth in his mouth where there should be four .
“ This mouth looks either fake or has some sad dental story behind it , ” said Dr. Leonard Kundel , a dentist who agreed to review the Labba avatar for The ███ . “ The third tooth from the center does not look real to me . If you compare it with the canine on the other side it is obvious . ”
“ In addition , ” Kundel said , “ the two front teeth do not look like they belong in this mouth . They are both narrower than they should and slightly more forward and whiter and chalkier . ”
Other avatars , like those used by the Lisa Moore and Joyce Toledano personas , show uncannily symmetrical features when overlayed on top of each other , with near perfect alignment of eyes , mouths , and eyebrows .
The backstories used to buttress the network ’ s credibility are similarly phony . Some authors pretended to be journalists , either freelance or former full . On her LinkedIn page , “ Salma Mohamed ” claimed to be a former reporter for the AP based in London , though no public record of an AP journalist matching Salma Mohamed ’ s description is available .
Another persona , Amani Shahan , described herself in bios for Global Villages and Persia Now as being a contributor to and “ ghostwriting articles ” for The ███ . No one by that name has ever written for The ███ and The ███ does not employ ghostwriters . ( Shahan also referred to herself with both male and female pronouns in different author bios . )
Others lied about their academic credentials . In articles posted at The ASEAN Post , Malaysian Reserve , and Manila Times , Cindy Xi held herself out as a “ Singapore-based research analyst for clients in the private sector ” with a PhD from the National University of Singapore . In an email , NUS said it was “ unable to retrieve the past records in the Dept ’ s database ” matching Xi ’ s name . A search of the National Student Clearinghouse database for the Navid Barani persona ’ s alleged undergraduate degree from James Madison University came up similarly empty .
At times , the network ’ s operators displayed either a mischievous sense of irony or a complete lack of self-awareness . One of its earliest pieces , “ How Qatar is using Disinformation Tactics to Attack its Rivals , ” complained about the state-funded Al Jazeera ’ s broadcasts and lamented that ” The landscape highlights a fascinating case study of how fake news can affect regional political discourse . ”
The piece is also the only public evidence that someone may have gotten wise to the network ’ s fakery . Editors at the International Policy Digest , where it was posted in September 2019 , quickly removed the article with a note saying it was taken down “ in response to criticism of the article ’ s sourcing ” and that “ We regret its publication . ”
Not that it caused the network much trouble . “ Lin Nguyen ” placed a similarly themed piece attacking Qatar about “ misinformation becoming the currency of soft power ” just a few days later in the Asia Times . By November , another persona from the network , Michel Haddad , was back posting at International Policy Digest .","If you want a hot take about the Middle East, Raphael Badani is your man.

As a Newsmax “Insider” columnist, he has thoughts about how Iraq needs to rid itself of Iranian influence to attract investment and why Dubai is an oasis of stability in a turbulent region. His career as a “geopolitical risk consultant and interactive simulation designer” and an “international relations senior analyst” for the Department of Labor have given him plenty of insights about the Middle East. He’s printed those insights at a range of conservative outlets like the Washington Examiner, RealClear Markets, American Thinker, and The National Interest.

Unfortunately for the outlets who published his articles and the readers who believed them, Raphael Badani does not exist.

His profile photos are stolen from the blog of an unwitting San Diego startup founder. His LinkedIn profile, which described him as a graduate of George Washington and Georgetown, is equally fictitious (and was deleted following publication of this article).

Badani is part of a network of at least 19 fake personas that has spent the past year placing more than 90 opinion pieces in 46 different publications. The articles heaped praise on the United Arab Emirates and advocated for a tougher approach to Qatar, Turkey, Iran and its proxy groups in Iraq and Lebanon.

Following this article’s publication, the Washington Examiner deleted its article written by “Badani,” replacing it with an editor’s note: “This op-ed has been removed after an investigation into its provenance and authorship.” Spiked, a British libertarian site, added a note atop both its articles by a fake persona, saying the outlet “takes seriously any claim of questionable authorship,” but left the text up in the interest of “transparency.”

Human Events, meanwhile, also affixed an editor’s note atop their article written by a fake persona, but outright defended its publication, writing: “We have reviewed the substance of this piece, and have not found any factual errors—and we still agree with the thesis of the piece. As such, we are keeping the piece up, and adopting its arguments as a publication.”

Newsmax deleted all articles by “Badani” and scrubbed his profile page listing him as an “insider”—all without any editor’s notes. The Post Millennial, The Jerusalem Post, and The National Interest also deleted their articles without any statement. (Yahoo News, which shared the National Interest’s story as part of a content share, said on Tuesday that they’ve deleted their iteration of the article and “are investigating and will take the necessary action with our partner to prevent this from happening in the future.”)

On Monday, Twitter suspended Badani’s account along with 15 others after The Daily Beast shared the results of its investigation into the network for violating the company’s “policies on platform manipulation and spam.”

“Using technology, human review, and partnerships with researchers and other independent organizations studying these issues, we work to identify platform manipulation on our service and take action,” a Twitter spokesperson told The Daily Beast in a statement. “As is standard, if we have reasonable evidence to attribute any activity to a state-backed information operation, we’ll disclose them—following thorough investigation—to our public archive.”

“This vast influence operation highlights the ease with which malicious actors can exploit the identity of real people, dupe international news outlets, and have propaganda of unknown provenance legitimized through reputable media,” Marc Owen Jones, an assistant professor at Hamad Bin Khalifa University in Qatar who first noticed suspicious posts by members of the network, told The Daily Beast. “It’s not just fake news we need to be wary of, but fake journalists.”

The network’s spree of hot takes targeted a range of publications and placed articles critical of Qatar and supportive of tougher sanctions on Iran in conservative North American outlets like Human Events and The Post Millennial, founded by conservative writer Andy Ngo, as well as Israeli and Middle Eastern newspapers like The Jerusalem Post and Al Arabiya, and Asian newspapers like the South China Morning Post.

Tying the network together is a series of shared behavioral patterns. The personas identified by The Daily Beast were generally contributors to two linked sites, The Arab Eye and Persia Now (which, following this article’s publication, have both been entirely deleted); had Twitter accounts created in March or April 2020; presented themselves as political consultants and freelance journalists mostly based in European capitals; lied about their academic or professional credentials in phony LinkedIn accounts; used fake or stolen avatars manipulated to defeat reverse image searches; and linked to or amplified each others’ work.

The earliest posts from personas in the network date back to July 2019 and were authored by Lin Nguyen, a fake “analyst in South Asian regional security,” according to her author biography. Nguyen and another persona, Cindy Xi, wrote mostly on East Asian issues, particularly how Hong Kong’s economy was faring under the coronavirus pandemic.

But the network soon grew and expanded its focus towards the Middle East. In February, two websites, The Arab Eye and Persia Now, were registered on the same day and began to acquire a host of contributors.

The Arab Eye describes itself, ironically enough, as a bulwark against “‘Fake News’ and biased narrative” with a mission that “now more than ever it is crucial to hear opinions from the other side of the aisle on matters pertaining to the Middle East.”

The sites may not appear to be linked to the outside observer but a search of the RiskIQ database shows both sites share the same Google Analytics account, are hosted at the same IP address, and are linked through a series of shared encryption certificates.

Like the majority of their contributors, the sites themselves appear to be fake.

Persia Now lists a non-existent London mailing address and an unanswered phone number on its contact form. The apparent editors of the outlets, Sharif O’Neill and Taimur Hall, have virtually no online footprints or records in journalism.

At Persia Now, The Arab Eye, and across dozens of other publications, the fake contributors have adopted similar themes in their opinion pieces. They’re critical of Qatar and, in particular, its state-funded news outlet Al Jazeera. They’re no big fans of Turkey’s role backing one of the factions in Libya’s civil war and have called it “bad news,” aimed at “constricting the flow of vital energy resources” to Europe, and “driving a wedge between and “dividing NATO.”

There are constant editorial lines like arguing for more sanctions on Iran or using international leverage to weaken Iran’s proxy groups in Lebanon and Iraq. The personas are also big fans of the United Arab Emirates and have heaped praise on the Gulf nation for its “exemplary resilience” to the COVID-19 pandemic, its “strong diplomatic ties” to the European Union, and supposedly supporting gender equality through the Expo 2020 in Dubai.

More recently, the personas have taken up the cause of criticizing Facebook for its decision to appoint Tawakkol Karman, a 2011 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, to its oversight board. Media outlets in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates have criticized the appointment of Karman, a former member of the Muslim Brotherhood affiliated Islah Party in Yemen, for her association with the group.

In pieces for the Jewish News Syndicate (which has since been deleted without explanation), Asia Times, Politcalite, and Middle East Online, the network cast Karman as a “nefarious political actor with a questionable past” who will make Facebook the “platform of choice for extreme Islamist ideology.”

None of the Twitter accounts associated with the network ever passed more than a few dozen followers, but a few still managed to garner high profile endorsements for their work. An article by “Joyce Toledano” in Human Events about how Qatar is “destabilizing the Middle East” got a shout-out from Students for Trump co-founder Ryan Fournier’s nearly million-follower Twitter account. French senator Nathalie Goulet high-fived Lin Nguyen’s broadside about Facebook and Tawakkol Karman (when informed of The Daily Beast’s reporting, the lawmaker replied: “Easy to tell after but thanks I will be careful.”

Kovacs,"Does an October 11 , 2019 press release from the Commission on Presidential Debates ( “ CPD ” ) announcing its 2020 debate schedule , and a recent court opinion , provide a glimpse into who controls our government ?
The CPD press release reiterates Federal Election Commission ( “ FEC ” ) requirements that candidate participation in Presidential debates be made on the basis of “ pre-established , objective ” criteria , applied to all candidates , and emphasizes its mission as “ voter education. ” Nothing could be further from the truth . Rather , CPD/FEC disguise a century-old effort by Republicans and Democrats and their officeholders , to ensure the laws are structured to limit ballot access and the political speech of those outside the two major parties .
The CPD , a private organization operating under FEC regulations , has government authorization to set standards that prevent third-party candidates from participating in presidential debates . The CPD has this power as long it does not directly endorse , support , or oppose a candidate , and selects at least two debate candidates .
Moreover , those with the most to gain from the major parties , corporations and media , can fund the debates . Notwithstanding an assertion of “ impartiality ” , CPD officials wear many hat ; e.g. , CPD board member and Chair of a political party . These officials can also take positions contrary to CPD when speaking in their “ individual capacity. ” Such looseness of structure allows the CPD to satisfy FEC requirements while setting “ objective ” standards not achievable by third-parties .
This controversy started immediately after the major parties formed the CPD in 1987 . Prior to the CPD , The League of Women Voters ( “ The League ” ) , sponsored the debates . When The League discovered the two major political parties secretly gave the campaigns control over questioners , composition of audience , and press access , it withdrew its support .
The League president , Nancy Neuman , characterized these actions as “ campaign-trail charades devoid of substance…that would perpetrate a fraud on the American voter . ”
From the inception of the CPD , only one third-party candidate was invited to debate – Ross Perot , Reform Party candidate , in 1992 , at the request of the other participants .
Before the 2000 election , the CPD amended its criteria to require participants to secure at least 15 % support in selected polls . This requirement is rarely achieved by a third-party candidate , and is much higher than required for state ballot qualification or public financing . Ralph Nader , Green party candidate on the ballot in 43 states , was so angry , the CPD had to physically bar him from the debates .
The real action however , was in the courts . Level the Playing Field and Gary Johnson , Libertarian Party , litigated against the 15 % poll criteria alleging FEC and CPD regulatory non-compliance and violations of First Amendment rights and the anti-trust laws . The FEC and the federal courts , in derogatory fashion , dismissed all complaints leaving the two major parties in complete control of the debates .
An appeals court noted : “ Every four years , we suffer through the celebration of democracy ( and national nightmare ) that is a presidential election . ”
The trial court dismissed as “ old news ” statements by the Republican chair of the CPD , that the Commission “ was not likely to look with favor on including third-party candidates in the debates ” and the Democratic chair saying he “ personally believed the panel should exclude third-party candidates from the debates. ” Also , the “ CPD director asserted CPD officials are “ permitted to wear multiple hats and can speak freely … in [ their ] … personal capacity . ”
The activities of the CPD are merely that latest efforts to ensure the two major parties control our country . “ The Constitution and the Ballot Box ” notes it was not until the 1912 elections , that the two major parties and the respective states feared they needed protection .

Who do these political parties represent ?","Does an October 11, 2019 press release from the Commission on Presidential Debates (“CPD”) announcing its 2020 debate schedule, and a recent court opinion, provide a glimpse into who controls our government?

The CPD press release reiterates Federal Election Commission (“FEC”) requirements that candidate participation in Presidential debates be made on the basis of “pre-established, objective” criteria, applied to all candidates, and emphasizes its mission as “voter education.” Nothing could be further from the truth. Rather, CPD/FEC disguise a century-old effort by Republicans and Democrats and their officeholders, to ensure the laws are structured to limit ballot access and the political speech of those outside the two major parties.

The CPD, a private organization operating under FEC regulations, has government authorization to set standards that prevent third-party candidates from participating in presidential debates. The CPD has this power as long it does not directly endorse, support, or oppose a candidate, and selects at least two debate candidates.

Moreover, those with the most to gain from the major parties, corporations and media, can fund the debates. Notwithstanding an assertion of “impartiality”, CPD officials wear many hat; e.g., CPD board member and Chair of a political party. These officials can also take positions contrary to CPD when speaking in their “individual capacity.” Such looseness of structure allows the CPD to satisfy FEC requirements while setting “objective” standards not achievable by third-parties.

This controversy started immediately after the major parties formed the CPD in 1987. Prior to the CPD, The League of Women Voters (“The League”), sponsored the debates. When The League discovered the two major political parties secretly gave the campaigns control over questioners, composition of audience, and press access, it withdrew its support.

The League president, Nancy Neuman, characterized these actions as “campaign-trail charades devoid of substance…that would perpetrate a fraud on the American voter.”

From the inception of the CPD, only one third-party candidate was invited to debate – Ross Perot, Reform Party candidate, in 1992, at the request of the other participants.

Before the 2000 election,the CPD amended its criteria to require participants to secure at least 15% support in selected polls. This requirement is rarely achieved by a third-party candidate, and is much higher than required for state ballot qualification or public financing. Ralph Nader, Green party candidate on the ballot in 43 states, was so angry, the CPD had to physically bar him from the debates.

The real action however, was in the courts. Level the Playing Field and Gary Johnson, Libertarian Party, litigated against the 15% poll criteria alleging FEC and CPD regulatory non-compliance and violations of First Amendment rights and the anti-trust laws. The FEC and the federal courts, in derogatory fashion, dismissed all complaints leaving the two major parties in complete control of the debates.

An appeals court noted: “Every four years, we suffer through the celebration of democracy (and national nightmare) that is a presidential election.”

The trial court dismissed as “old news” statements by the Republican chair of the CPD, that the Commission “was not likely to look with favor on including third-party candidates in the debates” and the Democratic chair saying he “personally believed the panel should exclude third-party candidates from the debates.” Also, the “CPD director asserted CPD officials are “permitted to wear multiple hats and can speak freely … in [their] … personal capacity.”

The activities of the CPD are merely that latest efforts to ensure the two major parties control our country. “The Constitution and the Ballot Box” notes it was not until the 1912 elections, that the two major parties and the respective states feared they needed protection. Teddy Roosevelt’s Bull Moose party had received more votes than the Republican, and the Socialist Party had received six percent of the presidential vote and won several congressional seats, 79 mayoralties and over 1,200 local offices. That year, the two major parties and state legislatures began making access to the ballot more difficult for third-party candidates than for major party candidates.

The results of their efforts are staggering. The Daily Kos estimates there are 519,682 elected officeholders in the United States. There are, however, around 390 non-major party elected officials: 168 Libertarians; 143 Green Party; 26 Constitution Party; 27 Independents; and 26 Democratic Vermont Progressives. The two major parties control 99.92% of all elected U.S. offices.

Notwithstanding the massive political control by the two major parties, Gallup finds 61% of Americans believe a third-party is needed.

To hear members of the White House press corps tell it, at stake is the First Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, and perhaps the very future of America as we know it.

In Singapore, a law intended to crack down on ""fake news"" went into effect Wednesday, much to the dismay of free speech advocates and journalists.

The Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act, which passed the country's parliament in May, requires online platforms — including social networking, search engine and news aggregation services — to issue corrections or remove content that the government deems false. Media companies that fail to comply face a fine of up to a 1 million Singapore dollars (about $722,000).

Individuals found guilty of violating the law, both inside and outside the tiny Southeast Asian country, could face fines of up to $60,000 or prison for up to 10 years.

Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong defended the bill when it passed, calling it a step in the right direction.

""I don't see our legislation as being in any way restrictive of free speech,"" Lee said in May, as quoted by the South China Morning Post. ""I see this as a practical arrangement which will help us to tackle the problem [of fake news].""

Critics of the law accuse the ruling party, the People's Action Party, of passing the measure as a preemptive move ahead of elections in March 2020. Lee party has controlled Singapore's government since the city-state located at the tip of the Malaysian peninsula became fully self-governing in 1959.

Opposition lawmakers and free speech advocates in Singapore and around the region say the law will stifle public discussion and hamstring journalists in a country they say is steadily marching further toward authoritarianism.

""But what worries me is that it would likely further entrench the culture of self-censorship, not just among journalists but among Singaporeans in general,"" Han tells NPR in an email.

Phil Robertson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch's Asia division, says in an email to NPR that the law ""provides a carte blanche for Singapore ministers"" to take down any online content they unilaterally deem false regardless of where it appears in the world.

I ’ m not making any predictions . I ’ m not for or against Trump . He still faces an uphill climb , given the Democrats ’ inherent Electoral College advantage , and would need to grab a major blue state . But with polling gains in such states as Nevada , Colorado , North Carolina and New Hampshire , Trump has enough of a path that with four days to go , he still has a shot .
How , one might ask , is that possible , given the extraordinary media avalanche that has tried to bury him ?
How can he still be competitive after most of the country ’ s newspapers and magazines have not just opposed him , but said he is utterly beyond the pale as a plausible president ?
It is beyond dispute that Trump has drawn far more coverage , and far more negative coverage than Hillary Clinton , and that some media critics have applauded this imbalance .
And the public gets it . Check out this USA Today poll : “ By nearly 10-1 , all those surveyed say the news media , including major newspapers and TV stations , would like to see Clinton rather than Trump elected . That includes 82 percent of Trump supporters and 74 percent of Clinton supporters . ”
On the opinion side , this will give you the flavor of the media opposition . A New York Times editorial says that from the moment he got in the race , “ it became clear that Mr. Trump ’ s views were matters of dangerous impulse and cynical pandering rather than thoughtful politics . Yet he has attracted throngs of Americans who ascribe higher purpose to him than he has demonstrated in a freewheeling campaign marked by bursts of false and outrageous allegations , personal insults , xenophobic nationalism , unapologetic sexism and positions that shift according to his audience and his whims . ”
A Washington Post editorial : “ Mr . Trump…has shown himself to be bigoted , ignorant , deceitful , narcissistic , vengeful , petty , misogynistic , fiscally reckless , intellectually lazy , contemptuous of democracy and enamored of America ’ s enemies . As president , he would pose a grave danger to the nation and the world . ”
Trump has also been opposed by papers that never endorse , like USA Today ; by papers that have never backed a Democrat , like the Arizona Republic ( 126 years ) ; by magazines that haven ’ t endorsed in 52 years , like the Atlantic . Plus , Trump has much of the conservative media establishment , including National Review and the Weekly Standard , doggedly against him .
Now the GOP nominee , for his part , has run hard against the “ disgustingly dishonest ” media . And obviously the media , for all their agenda-setting influence , don ’ t control the outcome of elections .
But what does it say that most of the media establishment is so relentlessly negative against a guy who is going to win at least 20 states and possibly more ?
To me , it goes back to the way the MSM originally dismissed Trump as a sideshow and a joke , a guy who deserved to be in the Huffington Post ’ s Entertainment section . But it goes far deeper than that .

I’m not making any predictions. I’m not for or against Trump. He still faces an uphill climb, given the Democrats’ inherent Electoral College advantage, and would need to grab a major blue state. But with polling gains in such states as Nevada, Colorado, North Carolina and New Hampshire, Trump has enough of a path that with four days to go, he still has a shot.

How, one might ask, is that possible, given the extraordinary media avalanche that has tried to bury him?

How can he still be competitive after most of the country’s newspapers and magazines have not just opposed him, but said he is utterly beyond the pale as a plausible president?

What does that say about the media?

It is beyond dispute that Trump has drawn far more coverage, and far more negative coverage than Hillary Clinton, and that some media critics have applauded this imbalance.

And the public gets it. Check out this USA Today poll: “By nearly 10-1, all those surveyed say the news media, including major newspapers and TV stations, would like to see Clinton rather than Trump elected. That includes 82 percent of Trump supporters and 74 percent of Clinton supporters.”

On the opinion side, this will give you the flavor of the media opposition. A New York Times editorial says that from the moment he got in the race, “it became clear that Mr. Trump’s views were matters of dangerous impulse and cynical pandering rather than thoughtful politics. Yet he has attracted throngs of Americans who ascribe higher purpose to him than he has demonstrated in a freewheeling campaign marked by bursts of false and outrageous allegations, personal insults, xenophobic nationalism, unapologetic sexism and positions that shift according to his audience and his whims.”

A Washington Post editorial: “Mr. Trump…has shown himself to be bigoted, ignorant, deceitful, narcissistic, vengeful, petty, misogynistic, fiscally reckless, intellectually lazy, contemptuous of democracy and enamored of America’s enemies. As president, he would pose a grave danger to the nation and the world.”

Trump has also been opposed by papers that never endorse, like USA Today; by papers that have never backed a Democrat, like the Arizona Republic (126 years); by magazines that haven’t endorsed in 52 years, like the Atlantic. Plus, Trump has much of the conservative media establishment, including National Review and the Weekly Standard, doggedly against him.

Now the GOP nominee, for his part, has run hard against the “disgustingly dishonest” media. And obviously the media, for all their agenda-setting influence, don’t control the outcome of elections.

But what does it say that most of the media establishment is so relentlessly negative against a guy who is going to win at least 20 states and possibly more?

To me, it goes back to the way the MSM originally dismissed Trump as a sideshow and a joke, a guy who deserved to be in the Huffington Post’s Entertainment section. But it goes far deeper than that.

The reason the media missed the rise of Trump is that they were out of touch with the anger and frustration of so many voters, especially working-class Americans. And even now, there is too little empathy for these voters and too little understanding of what motivates them, especially in certain precincts of New York, Washington and L.A.

Instead, there is plenty of condescension toward these voters, a feeling that they’re racist or xenophobic or just so ill-informed that they don’t realize that Trump is selling them snake oil.

Here is Times columnist Charles Blow declaring Trump an “existential threat,” declaring “with my last breath: America, are you (expletive) kidding?!

“I simply cannot wrap my head around how others with level heads and sound minds can even consider Trump for president of this country and leader of the free world.”

What a message: America, you must be dumb or crazy to support this guy.

Beginning next Wednesday, there will be plenty of hand-wringing about the ugly campaign, the Clinton investigations, the future of the Republican Party and so on.

Analysts argue that Trump ’ s potential use of a big tech algorithms to determine who could commit a mass shooting risks hitting lots of innocent people .
The White House refuses to respond to questions about whether Trump is considering using big tech companies to aid in corralling potential mass shooters .
One of the chief proponents urging the Trump administration to use big tech companies to collect data on users who could potentially conduct violent actions is a former NBC executive and long-time friend of President Donald Trump .
Reports show former NBC chairman Bob Wright has briefed Trump officials on a proposal to create an agency called Health Advanced Research Projects Agency , or HARPA , to design inventive ways to use data for preventing violent incidents . Wright is one of Trump ’ s long-time friends .
Ivanka Trump asked people pushing for the new agency if it could prevent mass shootings , one person familiar with the conversations who spoke on anonymity because off the sensitive details told The Washington Post on Sept. 9 . Her questions came after the shootings in El Paso , Texas , and Dayton , Ohio .
HARPA would develop “ breakthrough technologies with high specificity and sensitivity for early diagnosis of neuropsychiatric violence , ” according to a copy of the proposal . “ A multi-modality solution , along with real-time data analytics , is needed to achieve such an accurate diagnosis . ”
The document notes that such data collection would be up to new forms of technology , including Apple Watches , Amazon Echo and Google Home . Geoffrey Ling , the lead scientific adviser on HARPA , told reporters in August that the plan would require enormous amounts of data and “ scientific rigor . ”

Ling did not respond to ███ News Foundation ’ s request for comment about the nature of the program and whether it could be abused .
Trump has a close personal relationship with Wright , who founded the Suzanne Wright Foundation after his wife died from pancreatic cancer . Wright , a former chair of NBC who worked at the channel when Trump headlined “ The Apprentice , ” was a supporter of the president ’ s 2016 successful White House run .
Wright has not responded to the DCNF ’ s request for comment through his charity , AutismSpeaks . The White House has also repeatedly declined to comment on this story .
“ I would love if some new technology suddenly came along that would help us identify violent risk , but there ’ s so many things about this idea of predicting violence that doesn ’ t make sense , ” Marisa Randazzo , former chief research psychologist for the U.S. Secret Service , told reporters .
Such a program would probably flag tens , or hundreds of thousands , more possible suspects than actual shooters , Randazzo noted , adding that there ’ s a high possibility of false-positives .

Jon Stewart : “ For years , for years , for years , New Yorkers have done everything in our power to get this guy to leave town ! We passed laws making it tougher for hot dog vendors to sell on the streets . We hold gay pride parades . There are barely any gay people in the city . We just thought it would make him uncomfortable . So we shipped them in . We 've all , as New Yorkers come together to do this one thing . Get rid of Rush Limbaugh . ”

So we all , in New York , made an agreement that people who smoke cigars are douchebags . Fleets ! Fleets of Ivy League-educated cab drivers pretended to be surly middle-easterners , just to annoy Rush Limbaugh . We outlawed murder , figuring he ’ s the kind of guy whose probably got a taste for it . ”
Stewart : “ I guess there ’ s one more thing I want to say to him . If you ’ re heading out from Uptown , take 42nd Street west to Ninth Avenue take a left , go down four blocks , Lincoln Tunnel ’ s on your right , and you know what ? Here 's my EZ-Pass . Get the f * * * out of here . ”

Jon Stewart : “ Really ? You ’ ll go to your grave never having seen it ? When ’ s that scheduled for ? ”
Novak : “ I don ’ t see any reason for it . It 's a self-righteous comedian taking on airs of grandeur , and I do n't really need that . ”
Stewart : “ ‘ Self-righteous comedian taking on airs of grandeur ’ ? ! You just said you ’ ve never seen it . You don ’ t even , listen , I ’ m not going to deny I ’ m a pompous ass , but ‘ airs of grandeur , ’ that couldn ’ t have been what he said . I should check , let me check this transcript . Airs of grandeur . This is ridiculous , let me just , hold on , oh , it ’ s not . Hold on . Let me just , oh , God , that ’ s insane ! ”
Stewart : “ Yes , Robert Novak does not watch ‘ The Daily Show ’ or myself , not surprising . You know , I keep reading all these articles about how ‘ The Daily Show ’ is big amongst 115-year-old vampire demons , but why does Robert Novak - hate ? ”
Stewart : “ We can work this out because I know that you ’ re a good person deep down in your [ pauses for comedic effect , makes a series of circular gestures with his chest ] , the thing that they replaced your heart with that pumps the , I know you have redeeming qualities ! I see your redeeming qualities . For example , when you ’ re on television , you let others shine while you generously absorb all light and oxygen . When you leave an area , it stops raining . And I know that in the past I have referred to you as a douche bag . But that ’ s not an air of grandeur , that ’ s just mean and sophomoric , and I only said those things to you because I sincerely believe you ’ re a terrible person . I hope that helps .

Stewart : “ You ’ re going to get crushed . Give me a sense of the Vilsack doctrine , if you would . What is– What do you feel like–You know , we ’ ve had a president who was the governor of a state for eight years .

— Stewart interviewing former Iowa Governor and 2008 Democratic presidential candidate Tom Vilsack on Comedy Central ’ s The Daily Show , December 18 , 2006 .
“ The real question is , in the four years since 9/11 , you have to ask yourself : Has the government ’ s advancements , procedures , etc . made us safer , given us more comfort that they will have an effective , or more effective , response to catastrophic events ? And I think it ’ s very clear that the answer is ‘ Oh sh [ bleep ] t , we ’ re in trouble. ’ Now , for people who are saying , ‘ Well , stop pointing fingers at the President . Left-wing media is being too hard. ’ No . Shut up . No . This is inarguably , inarguably a failure of leadership from the top of the federal government . Now , now , this is , remember when Bill Clinton , I don ’ t know if you remember this , when Bill Clinton went out with Monica Lewinsky ? That was inarguably a failure of judgment at the top . Democrats had to come out and risk losing credibility if they did not condemn Bill Clinton for this behavior . I believe Republicans are in the same position right now . And I will say this , Hurricane Katrina is George Bush ’ s Monica Lewinsky . One difference , and I ’ ll say this , the only difference is this : That tens of thousands of people weren ’ t stranded in Monica Lewinsky ’ s vagina . That is the only difference . ”

Stewart Responds to Bernie Goldberg and Fox With ‘ Go F * * * Yourselves ’ Song
Jon Stewart : “ Bernie Goldberg , I don ’ t need to satisfy your version of what fair satire is or should be . I ’ m not fair . I ’ m not balanced .. You ’ re criticizing me for not living up to your tagline . Oh Lord . And you dismiss any criticism as further evidence of how the rest of the media persecute you . You like to pretend , Bernie Goldberg and Fox News , that the relentless conservative activism of Fox News is the equivalent , oh the equivalent , of the disorganized liberal influence you find on NBC , ABC and CBS . But Fox News , you may be able to detect a liberal pathogen in their blood stream , however faint . But Fox News is such a crazy overreaction to that perceived threat . You ’ re like an auto-immune disorder . I ’ m not saying the virus doesn ’ t exist in some small quantity . But you ’ re producing way too many antibodies . Fox News - you ’ re the lupus of news .

Jon Stewart : “ Putting aside the questionable contention that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have kept us safe here at home , you do know terrorism isn ’ t the only thing Americans would like to be protected from ? ”
News audio : “ The American society of civil engineers gives America ’ s crumbling infrastructure a D+ . The VA says at least 23 people have died waiting for care . 50 million Americans living below the federal poverty line . ”
Chris Jansing : “ Temperatures could go up by 9 degrees this century , and sea levels could rise an extra 10 to 21 inches . ”
Diane Sawyer : “ Thirty Americans die from gun violence in this country every single day . ”
Stewart : “ None of it ’ s terrorism , right ? Because then we ’ d have do something about it . If there is one man who embodied the ethos of the Republican party in this regard , I ’ d have to say , it ’ s our old friend Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama . Never met a war appropriations bill he didn ’ t like . Happy to spend the money overseas . ”
Senator Jeff Sessions : “ We need to resist the temptation to create more entitlements and more entitlements , which is one of the reasons that we ’ re heading recklessly to a fiscal crisis . But I don ’ t think we should create a blank check , an unlimited entitlement program now . ”
Stewart : “ Go f * * * yourself . You know what , I ’ m worried . I ’ m really worried about the Republicans . Their inability to wean themselves off of military intervention . They have a culture of defendancy , if you will , and I believe it ’ s turned them all into warfare queens . And I think we need to cut them off for their own good . We ’ ll be right back . ”
— Stewart on Comedy Central ’ s The Daily Show , June 26 , 2014 .
Jon Stewart : “ For the first day back there were really two stories that caught my attention . ”
News clip : “ NBC News has just confirmed that former Vice President Dick Cheney had heart transplant surgery earlier today . ”
Stewart : Greatest joke set-up ever ! I can make the show out of that . What ’ s the other story ?
Charlie Rose : “ The controversial shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin one month ago in Sanford , Florida . ”
Stewart : “ Dick Cheney got a new heart ! ( Laughs ) That ’ s the headline . Oh , the headline is Dick Cheney got a new heart . You know , I ’ m sure by the way that is a very different headline in the organ community . Probably something like innocent heart sentenced to life in Cheney . Boom ! Boom ! I ’ m going to get to do a ton of these today. ” .
Stewart : “ Heart transplant ! Isn ’ t more of a heart plant when you don ’ t have an original ? Hey , I think we have a clip of Cheney selecting the organ ! ”
Stewart : “ He ’ s-He ’ s-Dick Cheney ’ s not a nice man ... Are you ( beep ) ? Hey , everybody , here ’ s my impression of Dick Cheney ’ s surgeon removing Cheney ’ s original heart . Ah It bit me ! Oh my god ! Why does a human heart have fangs ? ”
—Stewart on Comedy Central ’ s The Daily Show , March 26 , 2012 .
Jon Stewart : “ Is Dick Cheney a righteous warrior or a psychopath ? It ’ s one thing to feel remorseless vengeance against those who have wronged us . Which is why we ’ ve always been a nation that has followed the vigilante ’ s code - I ’ m sorry , rule of law . Rule of law . But what if , hypothetically , this treatment was perpetrated on someone who had been detained wrongly , surely that would soften Cheney ’ s Bronsonlike torture boner . ”
Stewart : “ But look , perhaps we ’ re being unfair . I ’ m not suggesting that Dick Cheney is using the terrible specter of what happened on 9/11 robotically as a cudgel to beat down argument , draining all emotion and meaning out of that terrible day as he uses it in service of avoiding culpability . Yeah , I ’ m not doing that . ’ ”
Stewart : “ You know what , just because he ’ s so bitter and angry doesn ’ t mean I have to be . I ’ m going to end on a note of gratitude , with something I never thought that I would say : George W. Bush , thank you for not dying while you were in office . ”

Stewart: “I guess there’s one more thing I want to say to him. If you’re heading out from Uptown, take 42nd Street west to Ninth Avenue take a left, go down four blocks, Lincoln Tunnel’s on your right, and you know what? Here's my EZ-Pass. Get the f*** out of here.”

Robert Novak is a Heartless ‘Vampire Demon’





C-SPAN clip of Robert Novak, conservative columnist: “Somebody mentioned the Jon Stewart program. I’ve never seen that in my life, and I will go to my grave never having seen it.”

...

Jon Stewart: “Really? You’ll go to your grave never having seen it? When’s that scheduled for?”

Brian Lamb, C-SPAN: “Why?”

Novak: “I don’t see any reason for it. It's a self-righteous comedian taking on airs of grandeur, and I don't really need that.”

Stewart: “‘Self-righteous comedian taking on airs of grandeur’?! You just said you’ve never seen it. You don’t even, listen, I’m not going to deny I’m a pompous ass, but ‘airs of grandeur,’ that couldn’t have been what he said. I should check, let me check this transcript. Airs of grandeur. This is ridiculous, let me just, hold on, oh, it’s not. Hold on. Let me just, oh, God, that’s insane!”

...

Stewart: “Yes, Robert Novak does not watch ‘The Daily Show’ or myself, not surprising. You know, I keep reading all these articles about how ‘The Daily Show’ is big amongst 115-year-old vampire demons, but why does Robert Novak - hate?”

...

Stewart: “We can work this out because I know that you’re a good person deep down in your [pauses for comedic effect, makes a series of circular gestures with his chest], the thing that they replaced your heart with that pumps the, I know you have redeeming qualities! I see your redeeming qualities. For example, when you’re on television, you let others shine while you generously absorb all light and oxygen. When you leave an area, it stops raining. And I know that in the past I have referred to you as a douche bag. But that’s not an air of grandeur, that’s just mean and sophomoric, and I only said those things to you because I sincerely believe you’re a terrible person. I hope that helps.

Stewart to Democratic Presidential Candidate: At Least You’re Not an Expletive Like Bush





Jon Stewart: “Are you excited? Is it- Is it a whirlwind so far? Have you been on any bigger shows than this?”

Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack: “No. This is it. This is the first show.”

Stewart: “You’re going to get crushed. Give me a sense of the Vilsack doctrine, if you would. What is– What do you feel like–You know, we’ve had a president who was the governor of a state for eight years. The criticism was he didn’t have a lot of experience outside of his state and not that he hasn’t done a great job but what, what do you bring to the table that’s different other than you’re not, you know, seemingly an a–[bleeped].”

— Stewart interviewing former Iowa Governor and 2008 Democratic presidential candidate Tom Vilsack on Comedy Central’s The Daily Show, December 18, 2006.





Hurricane Katrina is George Bush’s Monica Lewinsky

“The real question is, in the four years since 9/11, you have to ask yourself: Has the government’s advancements, procedures, etc. made us safer, given us more comfort that they will have an effective, or more effective, response to catastrophic events? And I think it’s very clear that the answer is ‘Oh sh[bleep]t, we’re in trouble.’ Now, for people who are saying, ‘Well, stop pointing fingers at the President. Left-wing media is being too hard.’ No. Shut up. No. This is inarguably, inarguably a failure of leadership from the top of the federal government. Now, now, this is, remember when Bill Clinton, I don’t know if you remember this, when Bill Clinton went out with Monica Lewinsky? That was inarguably a failure of judgment at the top. Democrats had to come out and risk losing credibility if they did not condemn Bill Clinton for this behavior. I believe Republicans are in the same position right now. And I will say this, Hurricane Katrina is George Bush’s Monica Lewinsky. One difference, and I’ll say this, the only difference is this: That tens of thousands of people weren’t stranded in Monica Lewinsky’s vagina. That is the only difference.”

Stewart Responds to Bernie Goldberg and Fox With ‘Go F*** Yourselves’ Song





Jon Stewart: “Bernie Goldberg, I don’t need to satisfy your version of what fair satire is or should be. I’m not fair. I’m not balanced..You’re criticizing me for not living up to your tagline. Oh Lord. And you dismiss any criticism as further evidence of how the rest of the media persecute you. You like to pretend, Bernie Goldberg and Fox News, that the relentless conservative activism of Fox News is the equivalent, oh the equivalent, of the disorganized liberal influence you find on NBC, ABC and CBS. But Fox News, you may be able to detect a liberal pathogen in their blood stream, however faint. But Fox News is such a crazy overreaction to that perceived threat. You’re like an auto-immune disorder. I’m not saying the virus doesn’t exist in some small quantity. But you’re producing way too many antibodies. Fox News - you’re the lupus of news. So, I guess what I’m saying is this:

Choir sings with Stewart’s direction: “Go...”

Stewart:“...as long as fair and balanced is how you sell yourselves...”

Choir: “...f***...”

Stewart: “...I guess what I’m saying is this...”

Choir: “...yourselves.”

Stewart Tells Senator Jeff Sessions ‘Go F*** Yourself’



Jon Stewart: “Putting aside the questionable contention that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have kept us safe here at home, you do know terrorism isn’t the only thing Americans would like to be protected from?”

News audio: “The American society of civil engineers gives America’s crumbling infrastructure a D+. The VA says at least 23 people have died waiting for care. 50 million Americans living below the federal poverty line.”

Chris Jansing: “Temperatures could go up by 9 degrees this century, and sea levels could rise an extra 10 to 21 inches.”

Diane Sawyer: “Thirty Americans die from gun violence in this country every single day.”

Stewart: “None of it’s terrorism, right? Because then we’d have do something about it. If there is one man who embodied the ethos of the Republican party in this regard, I’d have to say, it’s our old friend Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama. Never met a war appropriations bill he didn’t like. Happy to spend the money overseas.”

...

Senator Jeff Sessions: “We need to resist the temptation to create more entitlements and more entitlements, which is one of the reasons that we’re heading recklessly to a fiscal crisis. But I don’t think we should create a blank check, an unlimited entitlement program now.”

Stewart: “Go f*** yourself. You know what, I’m worried. I’m really worried about the Republicans. Their inability to wean themselves off of military intervention. They have a culture of defendancy, if you will, and I believe it’s turned them all into warfare queens. And I think we need to cut them off for their own good. We’ll be right back.”

Stewart Declares Cheney Heart Transplant ‘Greatest Joke Set-up Ever!’



Jon Stewart: “For the first day back there were really two stories that caught my attention.”

News clip: “NBC News has just confirmed that former Vice President Dick Cheney had heart transplant surgery earlier today.”

[Stewart mouths “thank you” while looking up]

Stewart: Greatest joke set-up ever! I can make the show out of that. What’s the other story?

Charlie Rose: “The controversial shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin one month ago in Sanford, Florida.”

Stewart: “Dick Cheney got a new heart! (Laughs) That’s the headline. Oh, the headline is Dick Cheney got a new heart. You know, I’m sure by the way that is a very different headline in the organ community. Probably something like innocent heart sentenced to life in Cheney. Boom! Boom! I’m going to get to do a ton of these today.” .

...

Stewart: “Heart transplant! Isn’t more of a heart plant when you don’t have an original? Hey, I think we have a clip of Cheney selecting the organ!”

[Clip of someone removing a heart by hand]

Stewart: “He’s-He’s-Dick Cheney’s not a nice man...Are you (beep)? Hey, everybody, here’s my impression of Dick Cheney’s surgeon removing Cheney’s original heart. Ah It bit me! Oh my god! Why does a human heart have fangs?”

—Stewart on Comedy Central’s The Daily Show, March 26, 2012.

Stewart Accuses Cheney of Having a ‘Bronsonlike Torture Boner’



Jon Stewart: “Is Dick Cheney a righteous warrior or a psychopath? It’s one thing to feel remorseless vengeance against those who have wronged us. Which is why we’ve always been a nation that has followed the vigilante’s code - I’m sorry, rule of law. Rule of law. But what if, hypothetically, this treatment was perpetrated on someone who had been detained wrongly, surely that would soften Cheney’s Bronsonlike torture boner.”

...

Stewart: “But look, perhaps we’re being unfair. I’m not suggesting that Dick Cheney is using the terrible specter of what happened on 9/11 robotically as a cudgel to beat down argument, draining all emotion and meaning out of that terrible day as he uses it in service of avoiding culpability. Yeah, I’m not doing that.’”

...

Stewart: “You know what, just because he’s so bitter and angry doesn’t mean I have to be. I’m going to end on a note of gratitude, with something I never thought that I would say: George W. Bush, thank you for not dying while you were in office.”

Saunders, Jeffrey Lord, Matthew Vadum, Jeffrey A. Schaler, Richard E. Vatz","I can not wait to learn more about the identity and motives of the secret whistleblower who figures so prominently in stories of Trump ’ s phone call with the newly elected Ukrainian president . The narrative that began a month ago , as an insider ’ s accusation of Trump ’ s threat to cut off U.S. military aid unless investigations were launched into his expected opponent Joe Biden , has evolved considerably .
It now appears — in spite of initial denials — that the whistleblower consulted with House Intelligence Committee ( HIC ) staff before filing his complaint — and was advised immediately to obtain counsel . Somehow , the chosen counsel was part of a whistleblower search organization , whose staff had previously worked with HIC chairman Adam Schiff ( D-Calif. ) . While the whistleblower ’ s complaint was based entirely on secondhand hearsay — which was explicitly precluded under existing reporting rules — those rules were changed after the complaint ’ s receipt so as to do away with the requirement of firsthand knowledge .
What began as an admission that the whistleblower worked for the CIA and was a registered Democrat was accompanied by the absolute assurance that he was not an active partisan and had not worked in any current presidential campaign . That assurance now seems to be evolving into a situation in which the whistleblower had been assigned to the National Security Council , where he worked with former Vice President Biden — and may even have traveled with him on one or more trips to Ukraine .
Words are being chosen quite carefully , and the truth seems more and more elusive , as Republican HIC members continue to be kept in the dark . One is reminded of Lewis Carroll ’ s Alice in Wonderland , in which Alice exclaims , “ Curiouser and curiouser ! ”
While the mainstream media continues to provide breathless coverage as events unfold , they evidence a strong disinclination to ferret out more information regarding the whistleblower ’ s actual identity or motives in coming forward — almost relishing the idea that HIC hearings can feature his testimony ( whether he is actually present or not ) without his identity ever becoming known .
The obvious parallel is to “ Deep Throat , ” Woodward and Bernstein ’ s alleged secret source for many of their Watergate revelations , whose identity remained not only secret but also an integral part of Georgetown cocktail conversation for the next 30 years .
For those not living through the halcyon days of Watergate , Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein became famous for their series of revelations regarding the status of prosecutors ’ ongoing Watergate investigations , but it was not until their 1974 book , All the President ’ s Men , that they credited a secret source they claimed to have referred to as “ Deep Throat , ” after a popular pornographic movie character . The more recent backstory is that their publisher at Simon & Schuster had encouraged them to add more drama to their proposed book , which is how the term first came into being . In short , Deep Throat was not a term used in print or even newsroom discussions before it first appeared in their book — as their calculatedly mysterious source .
Regardless , speculation about just who Deep Throat might be was a dominant feature of Washington gossip for the ensuing decades . Possible candidates were inevitably confined to those who had served on President Nixon ’ s White House staff , including his Chief of Staff Alexander Haig , one of his many lawyers ( John Dean , Fred Fielding , Len Garment , or Fred Buzhardt ) , one of his speechwriters ( Bill Safire , David Gergen , or Ben Stein ) , or one of other young White House aides ( including Diane Sawyer , Jonathan Rose , or Jeff Donfeld ) . Even Henry Kissinger ’ s name occasionally surfaced in the unending speculation .
The common theme was that Deep Throat had become so disgusted with Nixon ’ s conduct that the need to reveal the wrongdoing far outweighed any idea of loyalty to the president . This was in spite of the fact that my boss and Nixon ’ s lead Watergate defense counsel thought at the time that the leaks were coming from Mark Felt at the FBI . This belief was accompanied by the recognition that we weren ’ t in a position to do much about it , since pressuring Felt might result in even more leaks . In fact , there is a humorous conversation on the White House tapes in which Haig suggests to Nixon that Felt is the one doing the leaking — and characterizes him as “ the white rat. ” Haig goes on to explain that ’ s what Felt is called behind his back at the Bureau : He has a long face and a rather sallow complexion . “ Well , Mr. President , he looks like a rat , ” is how Haig finally sums it up .
For decades afterwards , when I would mention that I had worked on Nixon ’ s White House staff , people would inevitably ask if I knew who Deep Throat was . When I answered in the affirmative , they would get all excited — until I said it was Mark Felt , the white rat . Then , since this obviously was not some famous name from Nixon ’ s own White House , their interest would wane and the conversation would move on .
When Felt ’ s daughter claimed he was Deep Throat in 2005 and Woodward and Bernstein rushed out a book , The Secret Man : The Story of Watergate ’ s Deep Throat , supposedly confirming it , everyone accepted it at face value . For his part , Felt was way too senile to provide any real confirmation . More significantly , it turned out that Felt had no animosity toward President Nixon ; his leaks were designed to show that Acting FBI Director Patrick Gray couldn ’ t control the FBI and should be replaced by then–Deputy Director Felt .
Why , then , had all of the media been so certain for the prior three decades that Deep Throat simply had to be a disillusioned Nixon White House staffer ? Following Felt ’ s 2005 outing , I went back and re-read All the President ’ s Men and then compared the book to the subsequent movie version — only to discover tantalizing differences in Deep Throat ’ s treatment .
In their book , there is no implication whatsoever that Deep Throat is a White House employee . The authors were very careful not to give any hint at all as to his place of employment . The movie version , however , differs considerably — with implied White House employment occurring in three separate scenes : First , relatively early on , Woodward ( played by Robert Redford ) and Bernstein ( played by Dustin Hoffman ) are shown on the Library of Congress steps , lamenting that they are out of leads . Redford offers up the idea that he has a contact at the Nixon White House — and their paucity of leads quickly evaporates . Second , at one point , Redford calls Deep Throat ( played by Hal Holbrook ) at work . In the movie scene , Redford is shown in a public phone booth ( remember those ? ) located on the sidewalk across the street from the Old Executive Office Building — an integral part of the White House compound — which he stares at while speaking to Holbrook , who instructs him never again to call him at work . Third , when Holbrook departs from his office on his way to deliver secret papers in a nighttime rendezvous , he is shown as driving out of the White House ’ s Northwest Gate .
The result was the unspoken assurance of Deep Throat being a White House staffer . The movie audience , after all , saw this with their own eyes !
Several other Deep Throat observations : By far the best description of Deep Throat and his activities is Max Holland ’ s Leak : Why Mark Felt Became Deep Throat ( 2012 ) , supplemented by Holland ’ s extensive critical review of the 2017 film Mark Felt . Separately , in a stressful FBI interview of Mark Felt , following his FBI retirement and shortly after publication of Woodward and Bernstein ’ s book , Felt is quoted by his FBI interrogators as having specifically denied that he was “ that fellow they call Deep Throat . ”
In spite of the Woodward and Bernstein books , I happened to believe their Deep Throat is a composite figure , rather than their exclusive source , a view apparently shared by their boss , Ben Bradlee . In an unpublished interview cited by Jeff Himmelman in Yours in Truth : A Personal Portrait of Ben Bradlee , Legendary Editor of The Washington Post ( 2012 ) , Bradlee expressed his own doubts as to the authenticity of the Deep Throat story :
You know I have a little problem with Deep Throat.… Did that potted [ plant ] incident ever happen ? … and meeting in some garage . One meeting in the garage ? Fifty meetings in the garage ? I don ’ t know how many meetings in the garage.… There ’ s a residual fear in my soul that that isn ’ t quite straight .
It also is interesting to note that lead Watergate prosecutor Earl Silbert has stated that nothing in the Woodward and Bernstein articles was helpful to his team of prosecutors since their stories were only reporting what the government already knew and had under investigation . Thus , while news to the general public , it was not revealing to those actually working on the case .
One wonders just how a reputation for relentlessly innovative and creative investigative reporting can be based on receiving a series of leaks from a disgruntled FBI official . Perhaps that ’ s why it was so important to keep Deep Throat ’ s identity secret long after the Watergate scandal had run its course .
Finally , and most significantly , it is now clear that the American public was knowingly misled for three decades regarding Deep Throat ’ s identity and motive — all seemingly for the purpose of further undermining President Nixon and his White House staff .
Just when , one might ask in light of all this , can we expect to learn the full truth about Trump ’ s whistleblower ?

Biden and Gloria Borger , CNN 's chief political analyst , discussed the VP 's future political ambitions and his take on whether the 2014 midterms will shift the balance of power in Washington in an interview that aired this morning .
“ If you look at every single major issue in this campaign , the American public agree with our position , ” Biden said , “ from federal support for infrastructure to minimum wage to marriage equality . ”
Biden is right , and the numbers are staggering . Seventy percent of Americans support increasing the minimum wage to $ 10.10 per hour , according to the results of a CBS News/New York Times poll from September . When Gallup asked whether voters would be more likely to support candidates who want to spend federal government money on infrastructure repairs , 72 percent said they would . Polling from ABCNews/Washington Post , The New York Times/CBS News , and McClatchy-Marist all shows majority support for marriage equality . Add universal background checks and federal action to combat climate change to the growing list of progressive issues backed by large majorities of the electorate .
Our polls show voters are angry , they 're fearful , they 're frustrated . Not only about domestic policy , like the roll out of the president 's health care reform , but also on the handling of Ebola and ISIS . So the question is how do you fix that ?
It 's true that a recent CNN poll found that voters are scared and angry -- when they are asked by pollsters how scared and angry they are . That poll , incidentally , did n't ask what issues matter most to voters .
All of this feeds right into the GOP electoral strategy of using fear-based appeals to sway voters .
“ With four weeks to go before the midterm elections , Republicans have made questions of how safe we are -- from disease , terrorism or something unspoken and perhaps more ominous -- central in their attacks against Democrats , ” The New York Times reported in October .
Since that time , CNN discussed the minimum wage on 35 broadcasts and mentioned unemployment or economic growth during 52 broadcasts , according to a Nexis search . Ebola appears in 565 news transcripts during that time . Even factoring in CNN 's international broadcasting , it would hard to find an hour of news programming that did n't feed into Ebola panic in the past 4 weeks .
And it 's not just CNN . Throughout the closing weeks of the election , news media have gone into overdrive helping Republican sow the seeds of Ebola panic .
Voters , meanwhile , are 11 times more likely to say that jobs and the economy are one of the most important issues heading into the economy than they are to cite Ebola .
Nevertheless , Borger was congratulated by her CNN colleagues for forcing Biden off a discussion of issues like raising the minimum wage .
“ He had listed that laundry list , that grocery list of items and you pushed him off that , you were right to , ” New Day host Chris Cuomo said . “ Because it 's all about the perception of whether or not there 's been leadership on the key issues , not the positions . ”
By defining the problem as one of perception , CNN lets Republicans off the hook for blocking massively popular policies like raising the minimum wage or establishing universal background checks on firearms sales .
Discussing her interview with Biden , Borger warned that Democrats would need to reconsider whether they spent enough time talking about the economy this election cycle . That would be a reasonable critique had Borger not just made sure the conversation was centered around fear and anger :
They 're going to have to have the discussion about whether they had a campaign with a bunch of themes , which I would argue they did n't , and what they can talk about . Should they have been talking about the economy , as Joe Biden was trying to talk about , or did they let the message get out of control on other items ? Lots of Republicans are running on fear .
And lots of media outlets are lending them a helping hand .","Forget the issues. Let's talk about fear and anger.

That message, coming out of a CNN interview with Vice President Joe Biden, perfectly captures the media's role in the 2014 midterm elections.

Our polls show voters are angry, they're fearful, they're frustrated. Not only about domestic policy, like the roll out of the president's health care reform, but also on the handling of Ebola and ISIS. So the question is how do you fix that?

It's true that a recent CNN poll found that voters are scared and angry -- when they are asked by pollsters how scared and angry they are. That poll, incidentally, didn't ask what issues matter most to voters.

All of this feeds right into the GOP electoral strategy of using fear-based appeals to sway voters.

“With four weeks to go before the midterm elections, Republicans have made questions of how safe we are -- from disease, terrorism or something unspoken and perhaps more ominous -- central in their attacks against Democrats,” The New York Times reported in October.

Since that time, CNN discussed the minimum wage on 35 broadcasts and mentioned unemployment or economic growth during 52 broadcasts, according to a Nexis search. Ebola appears in 565 news transcripts during that time. Even factoring in CNN's international broadcasting, it would hard to find an hour of news programming that didn't feed into Ebola panic in the past 4 weeks.

And it's not just CNN. Throughout the closing weeks of the election, news media have gone into overdrive helping Republican sow the seeds of Ebola panic.

Voters, meanwhile, are 11 times more likely to say that jobs and the economy are one of the most important issues heading into the economy than they are to cite Ebola.

Nevertheless, Borger was congratulated by her CNN colleagues for forcing Biden off a discussion of issues like raising the minimum wage.

“He had listed that laundry list, that grocery list of items and you pushed him off that, you were right to,” New Day host Chris Cuomo said. “Because it's all about the perception of whether or not there's been leadership on the key issues, not the positions.”

By defining the problem as one of perception, CNN lets Republicans off the hook for blocking massively popular policies like raising the minimum wage or establishing universal background checks on firearms sales.

Discussing her interview with Biden, Borger warned that Democrats would need to reconsider whether they spent enough time talking about the economy this election cycle. That would be a reasonable critique had Borger not just made sure the conversation was centered around fear and anger:

They're going to have to have the discussion about whether they had a campaign with a bunch of themes, which I would argue they didn't, and what they can talk about. Should they have been talking about the economy, as Joe Biden was trying to talk about, or did they let the message get out of control on other items? Lots of Republicans are running on fear.

And lots of media outlets are lending them a helping hand.",www.mediamatters.org,left,nKv2bwydUXP0Rx3N

President Michele Bachmann delivers on one of her campaign promises .
Drivers enjoying the cheapest gasoline in years may not know this , but they have retired Congresswoman Michele Bachmann to thank for the low prices at the pump . During her awe-inspiring run for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012 , Bachmann promised voters that if elected , she would bring them $ 2-a-gallon gasoline , and dang if she did not deliver on that campaign pledge this week .
The , how shall we say , not entirely reality-based , Bible-thumping former presidential candidate touted her accomplishment on Twitter this week , just to remind everyone .
You might wonder , did the fact that this miracle occurred under Democratic President Barack Obama cause any cognitive dissonance for Bachmann ? No , it did not . Because for that , you would have to have cognition to begin with .
2 . Tea partier Steve King makes bizarre comparison of Louisiana lawmaker to Jesus .
What would Jesus do , is a perennial question of the Christian faithful . Tea partying , rabid anti-immigrant congressman Steve King came up with a rather bizarre anwer to that question this week . King 's Jesus would give speeches to white supremacist groups , apparently . King was speaking about the controversy surrounding his Republican colleague Rep. Steve Scalise after reports emerged that he spoke at a conference with close links to former Ku Klux Klan leader and white pride-espousing politician , David Duke .
In an interview , King told the Washington Post that he and other conservative lawmakers plan to stand by Scalise , who is now the No . 3 Republican in the House of Representatives . They are apparently not bothered by the revelation that Scalise gave a speech at a white nationalists conference when he was a state lawmaker in 2002 . Scalise has claimed he did not really know who he was speaking to , which is odd .
Odder still is that King then suggested that consorting with white nationalists is similar to something Jesus might have done .
“ Jesus dined with tax collectors and sinners , ” King explained . “ It ’ s not the healthy who need a doctor , it ’ s the sick . Given that piece of scripture , and understanding that Scalise probably wasn ’ t staffed thoroughly , I could understand how something like this happened . But I know his heart , I ’ ve painted houses with him post-Katrina , and I know he is a good man . ”
3 . Fox News offers absurd advice to women in honor of the New Year .
What do men want ? It ’ s the age-old question . Oh , wait . No , it isn ’ t .
Fox & Friends offered some sage advice to the ladies on how to please their men on New Year ’ s day , so get out your notepad , gals .
It turns out that men like having their egos stroked , their meals cooked and their feet massaged , according to the crack experts on Fox .
“ Ladies , listen up , ” host Clayton Morris said . “ Ladies , we ’ re talking to you . If you still don ’ t have a New Year ’ s resolution , then could this be it ? ”
Morris recommends reading a new dating guide titled Single Man , Married Man , which was written by actual men , so women can get some “ honest advice on how to get a husband . ”
Co-host Peter Doocy is always up for offering helpful romantic advice . “ No matter where a woman was in life , she should always be able to cater to her man ’ s needs . ”
Token woman in the discussion Ainsley Earhardt struck a blow for feminism . “ Yeah , I do want to be a better wife . ”
But for Doocy , this was no joking matter . He 's all about helping the ladies . “ When he gets his ego stroked , ” he helpfully pointed out , “ he ’ ll be more inclined to love you more . ”
But that ’ s not the reason you should serve your man , Earhardt pointed out , just to get something in return . More inanities followed and will surely follow again .
4 . Conservative economist Art Laffer offers laughable analysis of why the economy is recovering .
Pity poor Fox News . Here the economy seems to finally be recovering somewhat , and the stock market has risen for the sixth straight year and that rascal of a president of ours has the audacity to crow about it .
Obama “ took a big bow , ” Fox 's Neil Cavuto whined on Friday . There has to be some explanation for it , other than any of his policies . The last thing any conservative brain would be able to entertain is that any sort of government stimulus might have helped , or heaven forfend , that quantitative easing was a good idea . The thought of more government spending ( except on the military , of course ) or eek , raising taxes on the uber-wealthy and corporations sends shivers up and down the conservative trickle-down economic spine .
Cavuto invited father-of-supply-side economics , Art Laffer , to help make sense of it , and well , frankly , he was not up to the job . After a brief moment of hilarity in which Cavuto made some crack about “ midgets ” and promised Laffer he was not making fun of the conservative darling ’ s physical stature , Laffer advanced his absurd theory . The reason the economy is recovering is because stimulus money has finally run out .
`` The reason we 're now coming out is because all of those stimulus dollars spent are now drying up and government spending as a share of GDP is falling very sharply , which is leading to a modest recovery right now , and I think it will continue and I 'm very optimistic about the long term , but the reason why we 're having any growth now is because of stimulus spending running off and not being there any more . ''
This is pretty far out of left field , even for ardent trickle-down economist Laffer . But no matter how wrong he is , he 'll always have a home at Fox .
5 . Head of Gun Owners of America blames ‘ black leftists ’ for racism .
If you had any doubt that gun nuts and racists have a little something in common , consider the case of Larry Pratt . This outstanding citizen heads up Gun Owners of America , a right-wing , pro-gun group , so comfortingly , he is armed to the teeth . He offered up his sterling analysis of the root cause of racism in America this week : it ’ s the black people .
Pratt made this claim during an interview with Internet hate-talk show host Stan Solomon . The two were discussing the deaths of unarmed black men Michael Brown and Eric Garner at the hands of white police officers . Pratt then spoke of the murders of two policemen in Brooklyn , which no one is celebrating .
“ Let ’ s face it , ” Pratt remarked . “ The racism that we are dealing with in our country comes primarily from a small group of black leftists , and it ’ s almost like a repeat myself — radical leftist , racist . When you ’ ve said radical leftist , you ’ ve pretty much said racist . ”
As if this were not vile enough , evil-as-hell Solomon upped the ante by suggesting that peaceful protesters should be killed , Right Wing Watch reported .
“ The next time there ’ s a die-in , make sure they ’ re dead , ” he said . “ The next time they block the road , run their asses over . ”","1. President Michele Bachmann delivers on one of her campaign promises.

If you had any doubt that gun nuts and racists have a little something in common, consider the case of Larry Pratt.

And not just any black people: black leftists.

Pratt made this claim during an interview with Internet hate-talk show host Stan Solomon.

Pratt then spoke of the murders of two policemen in Brooklyn, which no one is celebrating.

As if this were not vile enough, evil-as-hell Solomon upped the ante by suggesting that peaceful protesters should be killed, Right Wing Watch reported.

“The next time there’s a die-in, make sure they’re dead,” he said. “The next time they block the road, run their asses over.”

Still, it’s a real one, and one that ought to be relatively easy to combat. Instead, even the question of what constitutes fake news has begun to devolve into a matter of partisan opinion.

At this point, no one can stop right-wing nuts from attaching fake news as an epithet to every CNN report that bothers them. But there may still be time for the reality-based community to find enough common ground to tackle the original problem. If we can’t collectively find a way to counter misinformation so egregious that even its authors admit it’s a hoax, the outlook for the media—and the truth—in the Trump era is bleak indeed.",www.slate.com,left,9vn0t8VQOBwnN1Pg

ANALYSIS/OPINION:

It’s liberal columnist Jonathan Alter vs. Fox News President Roger Ailes.

That’s one of the main subplots in Mr. Alter’s new book, “The Center Holds: Obama and His Enemies,” chronicling the 2010-2012 political cycle. Mr. Alter expresses his vitriol toward Mr. Ailes, whose Fox News receives its own chapter in the book. Mr. Ailes alone rates more than 50 specific references.

A longtime columnist with Newsweek and now at Bloomberg, Mr. Alter admits he’s biased in favor of the president, but the author makes Mr. Ailes seem like the devil incarnate who created Fox News simply as a GOP propaganda machine.

I asked Mr. Alter if he considers the Fox boss the most sinister and powerful of Mr. Obama’s detractors. “I don’t rank the president’s enemies,” Mr. Alter replied in an email.

But in a variety of anecdotes, the author paints Mr. Ailes as so paranoid that he is concerned Islamic terrorists or gays may come to kill him. Mr. Alter claims the Fox president once had security guards throw a “Muslim-looking man out of the building.”

Nearly all of the same claims are made in an article in 2011 in Rolling Stone, but Mr. Alter has only one reference to that article in his poorly organized endnotes. Mr. Ailes dismisses the assertions.

I have no specific insight into the truth or falsity of Mr. Alter’s statements. But his other musings about Fox News itself are inaccurate, overblown or untrue.

The author propagates the myth that Fox, the No. 1 cable news operation for the past 11 years, is some sort of Republican propaganda machine. He apparently missed a recent Pew Research Center analysis that found both CNN and Fox each offer roughly 50 percent factual reporting vs. opinion, while the liberal cable-news alternative MSNBC tilted 85 percent toward opinion, with a mere 15 percent of its coverage devoted to factual reporting. That would qualify MSNBC as a “Democratic propaganda machine.”

I find both Sean Hannity and Bill O’Reilly, the two top Fox News hosts, hard to take. Their programs have a point of view — usually conservative, although Mr. O’Reilly argues he is independent — that triggers sparks and not much light.

Much of Fox News other programming, however, seems quite “fair and balanced” — the network’s famous motto — although I honestly think the slogan was conceived in part to tweak other media for their often-liberal political leanings.

For example, anchor Bret Baier of Fox’s nightly “Special Report” presents a straightforward newscast, although “The All-Star Panel” of news analysts tilts toward the right.

Hillary Clinton is thinking about running for president , a candidacy -- and possible administration -- that would no doubt intensify the already close and sometimes sensational scrutiny of her and her husband .
For Bill and Hillary Clinton , their view on the state of journalism in the United States comes from a place of deep knowledge and exposure . And like many who have been in the spotlight for a prolonged period , it 's a love-hate thing .

On Wednesday at his alma mater , Georgetown University , Bill Clinton faulted journalists for how they covered policy issues , saying it is `` dimly understood '' and often `` disconnected from the consequences of the policies being implemented '' because of journalists .
`` If a policymaker is a political leader and is covered primarily by the political press , there is a craving that borders on addictive to have a storyline , '' said Clinton as his wife looked on . `` And then once people settle on the storyline , there is a craving that borders on blindness to shoehorn every fact , every development , everything that happens into the story line , even if it 's not the story .

Last week , Hillary Clinton leveled an equally biting media critique , telling an audience at the University of Connecticut that `` journalism has changed quite a bit in a way that is not good for the country and not good for journalism . ''

`` A lot of serious news reporting has become more entertainment driven and more opinion-driven as opposed to factual , '' she said . `` People book onto the shows , political figures , commentators who will be controversial who will be provocative because it 's a good show . You might not learn anything but you might be entertained and I think that 's just become an unfortunate pattern that I wish could be broken . ''

In January 1995 , Blair wrote that Clinton expressed `` her total exasperation with all this obsession and attention , and how hard she 's finding to conceal her contempt for it all . ''
The most apparent next flashpoint on the relationship between the media and the Clintons came during Hillary 's 2008 race for the White House .
Late into the Democratic primary process as it became clear that Barack Obama had the momentum , the Clinton campaign 's view of the media began to sour .
The former President publicly and privately railed against what he called `` the most biased coverage in history , '' and both Clintons complained of what they believed to be a pervasive sexism dominating the campaign narrative .
Bill Clinton even publicly called one campaign reporter `` sleazy '' and `` a really dishonest reporter . ''
Now with Hillary Clinton admittedly `` thinking '' about a 2016 run , the question remains as to how her relationship with the media -- and its deep history -- could affect any campaign .
Stelter thinks these latest tweaks of the media could be an attempt to `` work the refs . ''
`` The Clintons have been choosing to go there , '' concluded Stelter . `` I do think one partial explanation has to do with any future campaign that we may see from Hillary Clinton . ''","Story highlights Suspicions of the media by the Clintons is nothing new

But there's new relevancy with Hillary Clinton thinking about a White House run

The two have made comments recently critical of news coverage

During the Arab Spring, Hillary Clinton heralded Al-Jazeera's coverage of momentous events in Egypt in 2011.

""Like it or hate it, it is really effective,"" Clinton said of the network at a congressional hearing while she was secretary of state.

She went on to decry ""a million commercials"" and ""arguments between talking heads,"" and ""the kind of stuff that we do on our news that is not providing information to us.""

The remarks primarily pointed out the growing influence Al-Jazeera was having on American viewers. But behind that, Clinton's testimony was a top-down critique of U.S. media.

""Her comments went to the heart of the way the media structure works,"" Brian Stelter, host of CNN's ""Reliable Sources,"" said.

And for her, they are again quite relevant.

In January 1995, Blair wrote that Clinton expressed ""her total exasperation with all this obsession and attention, and how hard she's finding to conceal her contempt for it all.""

The most apparent next flashpoint on the relationship between the media and the Clintons came during Hillary's 2008 race for the White House.

Late into the Democratic primary process as it became clear that Barack Obama had the momentum, the Clinton campaign's view of the media began to sour.

The former President publicly and privately railed against what he called ""the most biased coverage in history,"" and both Clintons complained of what they believed to be a pervasive sexism dominating the campaign narrative.

Bill Clinton even publicly called one campaign reporter ""sleazy"" and ""a really dishonest reporter.""

What's ahead?

Now with Hillary Clinton admittedly ""thinking"" about a 2016 run, the question remains as to how her relationship with the media -- and its deep history -- could affect any campaign.

Stelter thinks these latest tweaks of the media could be an attempt to ""work the refs.""

""The Clintons have been choosing to go there,"" concluded Stelter. ""I do think one partial explanation has to do with any future campaign that we may see from Hillary Clinton.""",www.cnn.com,left,wL8SFnOPba6wFgN1
media_bias,American Spectator,2,https://spectator.org/the-medias-climate-of-hate-myth/,The Media’s ‘Climate of Hate’ Myth,,"Robert Stacy Mccain, Jed Babbin, Geoff Shepard, Roger Kaplan, J.T. Young, Debra J. Saunders, Greg Jones","After 24-year-old De ’ janay Lenorra Stanton was found fatally wounded last August on the South Side of Chicago , the story received nationwide attention . This was not because homicide is rare in Chicago , where 589 people were murdered in 2018 , nor was the method of Stanton ’ s death — a single gunshot to the head — newsworthy in a city notorious for armed violence . Rather , what made this crime a subject of national attention was a matter of identity and presumed motive . Stanton ’ s murder highlighted “ the urgent need to address the epidemic of violence against the transgender community across the U.S. , ” declared Helen Parshall of the LGBT activist group Human Rights Campaign . “ Stanton ’ s death marks the 18th known killing of a transgender or non-binary person this year , ” Parshall wrote , bemoaning “ this tragic epidemic ” of anti-transgender violence .
This theme was reiterated in other coverage of Stanton ’ s death . “ Transgender women face considerably high rates of violence in comparison to cisgender women , though that risk is even higher for trans women of color like De ’ janay , ” Leila Ettachfini wrote on the feminist site Broadly , citing research by activist groups : “ For many transgender women of color , the threat of violence is constant . ”
Every time such a murder is reported , the media repeats and elaborates this message , as in the case of the recent murder of Dana Martin in Montgomery , Alabama , which was reported by the New York Times : “ At least 26 transgender people were killed in 2018 , the majority of them black transgender women , according to the Human Rights Campaign . In 2017 , advocates reported at least 29 transgender people fatally shot or killed by other violent means . ”
Police in Montgomery say they have no suspects in the murder of Martin , who was found shot death in a car Jan. 6 , thus becoming “ the first known transgender person killed this year in the United States. ” A local LGBT activist told the Times that murders of “ trans people of color are just happening more and more often and very little is being done about it. ” This is self-evidently false , as even the statistics cited by activist groups indicate that the number of such crimes declined about 10 % in the past year , despite the rhetoric about an “ epidemic ” of anti-transgender violence . As to the question of what is “ being done about it , ” the police in Montgomery , as in other cities , say they ’ re doing their best . There were more than 17,000 homicides in the United States in 2017 , the most recent year for which Justice Department figures are available , and the reported number of transgender victims was a minuscule fraction of a single percentage point of those murders . No one should imagine , of course , that the liberal media and activist organizations have suddenly taken an interest in supporting the law enforcement community and urging them to bring criminals to justice . No , all the noise about an alleged “ epidemic ” of anti-transgender violence is about blaming President Trump .
Last year , Beverly Tillery , executive director of the New York City Anti-Violence Project , declared in a Huffington Post column : “ Many people have asked if the current regressive political climate legitimized by the language and policies of the Trump administration and others could be contributing to the rise of hate violence . Our answer is yes.… Over and over , President Donald Trump and his administration have attempted to erase , demonize and discriminate against members of the LGBTQ community. ” Tillery was one of the sources quoted this week by CNN ’ s Jen Christensen parroting the claims of transgender activists that “ violence against the community is getting worse , ” and pointing the finger of blame directly at the White House :
Activists say anti-trans rhetoric stigmatizes the community and raises the risk of violence . … Tillery , of the New York City Anti-Violence Project , feels that Trump has created a “ really scary time for the whole LGBTQ community. ” “ Every week , there is another news event that is equally triggering and terrifying , that leaves people not knowing where they can be safe . They are left with an uncertain future in this country , ” Tillery said . “ When you dehumanize people and try to erase them completely from existence , it emboldens those who hate this community , and no one is really stopping them , aside from the community rising up . ”
Of course , we must keep in mind the fact that the reported number of transgender homicides has actually decreased since Trump became president , but also note that the national media didn ’ t bother paying attention to such crimes until after he was elected . We don ’ t actually know how many transgender people were murdered during Barack Obama ’ s eight years in the White House , because it wasn ’ t until Trump was elected that liberal journalists started hunting for evidence of a “ climate of hate ” they could blame on the Republican president .
Even if one were willing to stipulate , arguendo , that Trump is guilty of “ anti-trans rhetoric ” or otherwise responsible for creating a “ really scary time for the whole LGBTQ community , ” however , such claims are a non sequitur when we examine the motives and circumstances in cases that constitute the alleged evidence of a “ climate of hate. ” Consider an October 2017 murder that occurred in Nueces County , Texas . Sheriff ’ s officers responded to a call and found the body of 47-year-old Juan Montes , also known as “ Stephanie Montez. ” According to the initial report in the Corpus Christi Caller-Times newspaper , “ Medical examiner Heraldo Pena said authorities initially believed the person was a woman ; the person was wearing a dress and make up . They discovered later the person was male and that he had been shot in the chest , abdomen and a shoulder . ”
That report inspired indignation among activists who complained “ Stephanie ” had been “ deadnamed ” and “ misgendered , ” as if this were worse than being shot to death . However , Juan/ “ Stephanie ” had not undergone sex-change surgery and had male genitalia , and he had not legally changed his name , but such facts mean nothing to activists whose lives are apparently organized around being perpetually outraged over perceived anti-transgender prejudice . The national media eagerly pander to these activists and their counter-factual ideology , which explains why the death of “ Stephanie Montez ” was featured in a Nov. 10 , 2017 , New York Times article headlined , “ Violence Against Transgender People Is on the Rise , Advocates Say. ” The article quoted the ubiquitous Beverly Tillery as an authority for the assertion that there had been “ a spike in incidents of hate violence ” since Trump ’ s election : “ There is an increased climate of hate that is , in some cases , being allowed to grow . ”
Unfortunately for the climate-of-hate theorists , the facts in the Nueces County murder of Juan/ “ Stephanie ” contradicted their theory . Four people — Cedric Green , 39 , Randy Dorsey , 41 , Chloe Huehlefeld , 36 , and Jace Montange , 22 — were charged in connection with the shooting . Prosecutors say Green had previously sold drugs to Juan/ “ Stephanie ” and that Green organized the murder plot because he suspected Juan/ “ Stephanie ” of having stolen $ 20 — four rolls of dimes — from his girlfriend , Huehlefeld . Both Green and Huehlefeld were subsequently convicted and sentenced to prison ; Dorsey was sentenced to 10 years ’ probation after accepting a plea bargain in return for testifying against his co-defendants ; the trial of Montange has been delayed . Anyone who cares to research this crime must conclude it had nothing to do with “ anti-trans rhetoric ” or a “ climate of hate , ” nor is there any reason to believe Cedric Green and his crew were Trump supporters .
Of course , the New York Times never followed up to inform its readers of the outcome of the “ Stephanie Montez ” case . This is a discernible pattern in national media coverage of such cases . A transgender victim is murdered , activists draw attention to the crime , national media report it with quotes from activists decrying the “ epidemic of violence ” supposedly inspired by “ hate ” and then… silence . You can hear the crickets chirping while you wait for the national media to report on the outcomes of these cases , once police put the cuffs on a suspect . Over and over , these crimes become strictly local news after it is determined that the murdered transgender person was killed for something as squalid as the stolen $ 20 in dimes that led to the murder of Juan/ “ Stephanie ” in Nueces County .
For example , in June 2017 , it was reported that 17-year-old Rayquann Deonte Jernigan , a/k/a “ Ava Le ’ Ray Barrin , ” had become the “ Youngest Trans Murder Victim In The U.S . This Year. ” Was this murder caused by a Trump-inspired “ climate of hate ” ? No , according to police in Athens , Georgia , this fatal shooting was “ the culmination of a feud between two transgender groups. ” A judge dismissed a murder charge against the accused shooter , ruling that Jalen Breon Brown , 21 , acted in self-defense during a fight with Jernigan . Or what about the March 2018 murder of Darrel “ Amia Tyrae ” Berryman in Louisiana ? The Human Rights Campaign reported that Berryman , “ a transgender woman of color , ” had become “ the seventh known homicide of a transgender person this year. ” Was Berryman killed by a Republican voter ? No , the police charged Dedrick Butler , a 22-year-old convicted felon , with murdering Berryman in a $ 55-a-night East Baton Rouge motel room where “ Amia Tyrae ” was working as a prostitute .
Quite frankly , many of these murder victims seem to spend a lot of time in bad neighborhoods hanging around bad people who do bad things . If it weren ’ t for activists promoting the “ climate of hate ” narrative , and a liberal media establishment eager to seize on these crimes for anti-Trump propaganda purposes , homicides like these would never be more than local news . But the activists have their agenda , and so when police found De ’ janay Lenorra Stanton shot in the head last August , the victim ’ s name was added to the roll honored on the “ Transgender Day of Remembrance ” in November . When police arrested a suspect last week , however , it was strictly local news .
According to police , Stanton had been having sex with a 17-year-old named Tremon Hill , “ a lanky Phillips High School student who… played on the school ’ s basketball team. ” Hill was concerned about some photos he had sent to Stanton and was reportedly suicidal over his involvement with Stanton , who worked as a prostitute . The Chicago Sun-Times reported Sunday : “ Stanton received a text from Hill the morning of her killing asking her to meet him ” in a parking lot , according to the prosecutor . “ Just after 11 a.m. , Hill is alleged to have shot Stanton in the head and left her lying on the ground outside of her car . ”
Not a Trump voter . Just a high-school kid distraught about his involvement with a 24-year-old transvestite prostitute . This doesn ’ t fit the media ’ s “ climate of hate ” myth , of course , and so it ’ s strictly local news .

media_bias,Salon,0,http://www.salon.com/2015/06/15/the_facts_vs_david_brooks_startling_inaccuracies_raise_questions_about_his_latest_book/,The facts vs. David Brooks: Startling inaccuracies raise questions about his latest book,2015-06-15,,"For at least the past four years David Brooks , the New York Times columnist , TV pundit , bestselling author and lecture-circuit thought leader , has been publicly talking and writing about humility . Central to his thesis is the idea that humility has waned among Americans in recent years , and he wants us to harken to an earlier , better time .
One of the key talking points ( if not the key talking point ) cited by Brooks in lectures , interviews , and in the opening chapter of his current bestseller , “ The Road to Character , ” is a particular set of statistics -- one so resonant that in the wake of the book 's release this spring , it has been seized upon by a seemingly endless number of reviewers and talking heads . There ’ s just one problem : Nearly every detail in this passage – which Brooks has repeated relentlessly , and which the media has echoed , also relentlessly -- is wrong .
My journey down the Brooks rabbit hole began around two years ago , when I was conducting research for my book “ Invisibles : Celebrating the Unsung Heroes of the Workplace. ” The book largely consists of long-form profiles of professionals who thrive behind the scenes , and a lot of time is spent positioning these people as counterpoints to our contemporary culture of attention . In setting a historical context , I argue that there has been a shift away from self-effacement toward one where gaining recognition seems to be prized above all else . It ’ s easy to see the dovetail with Brooks ’ premise about a shift from humility .
So it was that I came across video of a lecture he had given at the 2011 Aspen Ideas Festival , where he stated :
In 1950 the Gallup Organization asked high school seniors “ Are you a very important person ? ” And in 1950 , 12 percent of high school seniors said yes . They asked the same question again in 2006 ; this time it was n't 12 percent , it was 80 percent .
This seemed like a great stat to consider for my book , so I set about doing what I always aim to do when I come across a secondary source : I checked the facts . Before segueing to my current career as a writer , I spent about six or seven years as a magazine fact-checker , mostly for Condé Nast magazines ; seeking primary sources for facts is my default mode .
I began by emailing a media contact at Gallup . After a series of exchanges , I was relayed to another Gallup employee . Ultimately I communicated directly with three different people at Gallup , and they communicated with multiple other staff , including a group in Princeton who combed Gallup ’ s print archives . During the process , a Gallup employee and I also emailed Brooks , but neither of us got a response . ( Granted , I didn ’ t expect one , given that I had emailed his New York Times address , which likely receives a torrent of messages daily . I assume Brooks has another , more private email address he actually uses . ) In their last email on the matter , the representatives at Gallup stated their final verdict : They did not “ have any record of the data ” that Brooks cited . But they also suggested that I try contacting Brooks again , and that if he shared any new information they would reopen the inquiry .
It was frustrating that they wouldn ’ t definitively just say Gallup didn ’ t conduct the polls Brooks cited , but if a number of people on the staff couldn ’ t find the polls then I knew either Gallup had atrocious record keeping , or Brooks was wrong . I hated that this tiny window of doubt was open , but there didn ’ t seem to be a path to find out one way or the other , so I gave up and didn ’ t include the passage in my book .
Fast forward to April 2015 , when I came across a review of “ The Road to Character ” in the New York Times Book Review . To my amazement , the same statistic from the Aspen talk , once again credited to Gallup , was paraphrased . And my obsession with the mysterious Gallup poll roared back to life .
It was one thing if Brooks made erroneous claims in a one-off lecture . It was something else entirely to put those same claims in a book . Now I had to get to the bottom of this . I wanted to fact-check the review to make sure the reviewer was accurately quoting from the book . I did a search on Google Books for part of the quote and found it . After that , I went to Barnes and Noble and looked up the passage in the actual book just to confirm it was there .
`` In 1950 , the Gallup Organization asked high school seniors if they considered themselves to be a very important person . At that point , 12 percent said yes . The same question was asked in 2005 , and this time it wasn ’ t 12 percent who considered themselves very important , it was 80 percent . ''
Over the course of my search I discovered other iterations of the passage as well : During a 2011 appearance on “ Real Time With Bill Maher , ” for example , Brooks tells the same exact story , except in this telling , the second study took place not in 2005 or 2006 , but in 1998 .
The NYT 's review of `` The Road to Character '' itself picked up the pattern of changing dates , when the reviewer noted that the passage in question was similar to one in an earlier Brooks book , “ The Social Animal , ” only it was written “ with slightly different dates . ”
`` In 1950 a personality test asked teenagers if they considered themselves an important person . Twelve percent said yes . By the late 1980s , 80 percent said yes . ''
Somehow , between the publication of `` The Social Animal '' in 2011 and the publication of `` The Road to Character '' in 2015 , a study that originally occurred , by Brooks ' telling , in `` the late 1980s '' became one that occurred nearly 20 years later . ( Amazingly , to the New York Times reviewer , the late 1980s and 2005 are only “ slightly different dates. ” And how was any difference in dates for the same citation , no matter how “ slight , ” not problematic to the Times reviewer ? )
What began as a simple fact-check of a Gallup poll was devolving into a morass .
I contacted Brooks ' publicist at Random House , and found the email address for a student at Yale who was thanked in the acknowledgments of `` The Road to Character '' as his fact-checker . The Yalie never replied , but I did get a response from his publicist , who told me that she had to check with Brooks , and that she would get back to me . It took over a week , but she replied with an admission that the study was wrongly ascribed to Gallup , but that the “ sociological trend is accurate. ” She also provided a link to what she said was the actual study ( “ Changes in Adolescent Response Patterns on the MMPI/MMPI-A Across Four Decades , ” an analysis by university scholars of various data sets ) , and said the passage would be corrected in future printings of the book .
When I clicked the link and read the abstract , the first thing I noticed was the paper itself was published in 2003 . `` The Road to Character '' stated that the data set was from 2005 ; how could that be when the final published paper came out two years earlier ? That paper listed two relevant sets of data : One set collected in 1948 and 1954 , and another set from 1989 . I emailed Brooks ' publicist again . Had he merged the 1948 and 1954 polls into one that he then listed as having occurred in “ 1950 ” ? And what the hell was up with the 2005 date listed in `` The Road to Character '' ?
I then contacted two of the authors of the paper , Cassandra Newsom , a professor of pediatrics , psychiatry , & psychology at Vanderbilt University , and Robert Archer , a professor of psychiatry at Eastern Virginia Medical School . Abstracts and studies in general can be a challenge for the layperson to read , as academic text is often as opaque as legalese . So they sent me the actual paper and I went through it over the phone with Newsom . Here ’ s where things really began to unravel .
Newsom explained that , indeed , the first data set was from samples taken in 1948 and 1954 , not 1950 , and the second data set was from 1989 , not 2005 . Also , the first data set was exclusive to Minnesota , where respondents were disproportionately white , while the second was a more heterogeneous national sample . The respondents were not high school seniors , as Brooks wrote : In the ’ 48 and ’ 54 set , respondents were ninth graders ; the 1989 sample was composed of 14- to 16-year-olds . ( The ’ 48 and '54 data set was later sifted to match the 1989 set by including only ninth graders who were aged 14-16 . ) Lastly , in the 1989 set , 80 percent of boys answered “ true ” to the statement “ I am an important person , ” and 77 percent of girls said true . Yet Brooks cited 80 percent as the only figure . I asked Newsom if it was possible that some other study was done in 2005 with the same “ I am an important person ” question . She said there has not been another normative sample since 1989 .
( I emailed Brooks ’ publicist a third time , asking her to contact Brooks for clarification on the stream of additional apparent inaccuracies but never heard back . )
The thing I keep wondering is how did Brooks get nearly every detail of this passage wrong ? He said Gallup did the polls , when they were actually done by academics . He merged a data set from 1948 and 1954 into 1950 . He said the second data set was from 2005 , when it was from 1989 ( to me , the most damning and damaging inaccuracy ) . He said it was high school seniors , when it was ninth graders . And he said 80 percent answered true , when that was only so for boys . Can one accidentally get this many details wrong ?
So the question is , if it wasn ’ t an accident , why would Brooks deliberately falsify nearly every detail in a passage of his book , let alone one that is a cornerstone of the book ’ s P.R . campaign ? If you Google David Brooks and “ Gallup ” a vast scroll of media mentions of this erroneous passage appears . Brooks is a very talented writer , and whether you agree with him or not , he ’ s highly skilled at expressing ideas in compressed , digestible bites . After all , that is his job as an Op-Ed columnist . As I dug into the case , I watched the Aspen video again , while also referencing other lectures Brooks gave . Every time , he spoke with pith and humor ; the audiences laughed and cheered along with his jokes and likably nebbishy demeanor . The guy knows what works .
As his publicist suggested , he may be right about the general trend . So why did he feel the need to gild the lily ? Why couldn ’ t he have referenced the paper using the correct statistics ? Perhaps it is a sign of his skill as a communicator , and his weakness , to know how to make a passage particularly seductive . On `` Morning Joe , '' as one of the hosts recited the erroneous passage , another host waved a cellphone , signaling , “ See ? This is the problem with today ’ s youth ! ” Saying 1989 for the latter date wouldn ’ t quite work for that bit .
In addition to his factual errors , it ’ s worth noting that Newsom and Archer challenge Brooks ’ interpretation of their paper . Newsom explained to me that “ I am an important person ” was one question in a subset of questions related to “ Ego inflation. ” Interestingly , though this one question had a huge jump , ostensibly supporting the case of less humility over time , in fact , the overall subset that this question was a part of -- Ego Inflation -- had a relatively small increase from the first data set to the second . It ’ s generally not sound to spotlight one question in isolation , especially if it contrasts with the findings of the overall study or subset .
One reason is language itself . The words “ I am an important person ” may have been interpreted differently in the '40s and '50s , than in 1989 . Archer said that the early sample may have interpreted the item as meaning “ more important than others ” whereas the '80s sample may have read it to mean “ I believe I am a valuable person. ” Further , though the authors compare a sample from Minnesotans to a national sample , it ’ s done so in a paper intended to be read and interpreted by academics , who can weigh the discrepancy . Mainstream readers would likely benefit from knowing the samples are not apples to apples , as Brooks ’ citation implies .
As critical as the point of this paragraph and the previous one is , interpreting data is highly complex and not always an exact science and one could argue over what ’ s reasonable to include or exclude when referencing academic papers for a general audience ; the focus of this essay is on factual inaccuracies . ( But considering my intense spotlight on this passage , I ’ d be remiss to not at least mention the paper 's authors ' displeasure with Brooks ' cherry-picking a question out of context , drawing a misleading conclusion from it , and it becoming the lead sound bite in the media for a No . 1 bestselling book . )
It ’ s generally considered reasonable by fact-checkers and editors to allow for quotes from different sections of an interview to be merged , as long as the meaning behind them isn ’ t misrepresented . When you read quotes in an article , they ’ ve often been cleaned up for grammar , and the “ ums ” and tongue clucking that populate regular speech are generally deleted . But those changes are made with the intent of bringing clarity . Statistics , especially ones from scientific papers , need to stay precise and accurate . Changing them will almost always be construed as done in the name of persuasion . It ’ s a dangerous ploy to start fudging numbers and wordings from academic studies .
How did so many details from this passage change from one book to the next ? How did the late 1980s morph into 2005 , teenagers to high school seniors , and a personality test to the Gallup Organization ? It ’ s interesting that as the passage distanced itself further from the truth in its second iteration , it also became more specific in its details .
I then watched the Aspen talk again and remembered something . I had another statistic from Brooks in my research notes for “ Invisibles. ” In the talk he said : “ In 2006 , 51 percent of 25 year-olds said that being famous was the most important life goal they could have. ” In `` The Road to Character , '' the text is massaged to : “ By 2007 , 51 percent of young people reported that being famous was one of their top personal goals . ”
The endnote in his book lists “ How Young People View Their Lives , Futures and Politics : A Portrait of ‘ Generation Next ' ; The Pew Research Center for the People & the Press ” as the source . But the Pew survey itself reads : “ When asked not about themselves but about their generation , most 18-25 year-olds say getting rich and being famous are important goals for people in their age group. ” [ Emphasis mine . ]
This is a nuanced but critical difference . Young people were giving their impression of their generation , not observations of themselves personally . How we view our culture or a subset that we are a part of is , of course , not necessarily the same as how we view ourselves . Again , like the changes he made to the “ I am an important person ” passage , it ’ s worth noting that Brooks ’ revision of the language here , too , results in a more persuasive sound bite .
What makes the case against mere catastrophic sloppiness is that , oddly , Brooks had the luxury of a fact-checker . Unfortunately , due to the expense , it ’ s rare for writers to have dedicated fact-checkers outside of high-end magazine journalism . Can every New York Times book reviewer be expected to fact-check any content they reprint or paraphrase ? ( Maybe not . But if you know a passage citing statistics is a repeat from an earlier book , but with different dates , probably , yeah . ) What about TV show hosts ? Even when writers have the best intentions , it is inevitable that errors will be introduced into their articles , and even more so books that are hundreds of pages long . We must ask , what errors , to a reader , are acceptable ?
In a recent Atlantic article the writer lamented that if there isn ’ t room today for a writer like Joe Mitchell -- a New Yorker scribe of yore who fabricated significant passages in his journalism -- “ The problem isn ’ t him-it ’ s us. ” But facts always matter . And if the writer is practicing some form of “ new ” journalism , then he should let the reader know , perhaps the way films use the “ inspired by ” disclaimer .
The question I keep wondering , and what I think perhaps is most relevant with Brooks , is why ? Why would someone with this level of prestige and influence be so woefully sloppy in his reportage — or worse ? Imagine yourself for a moment as an Op-Ed writer for the most influential newspaper in the world ; you get paid huge sums of money for a string of bestselling books , you entertain and enlighten live crowds at your lectures , you get paid to spout your opinions on TV . I don ’ t know what it would do to my head if I had the level of influence that Brooks has as a writer and cultural commentator . Perhaps , as a friend of mine suggested , maybe Brooks is just glib .
Ultimately , maybe it doesn ’ t even matter whether the passage was fudged on purpose or not . Perhaps to be so careless shows the same degree of culpability , and condescension toward the reader , that willful manipulation does .
As I was about to send the draft of this article to my editor I did a quick review again of “ The Road to Character ” on Google Books . To Brooks ’ publicist ’ s word , based on my email to her , future printings of the book , indeed , appear to be different . Now the passage reads :
“ In 1948 , psychologists asked more than 10,000 adolescents whether they considered themselves to be a very important person . At that point , 12 percent said yes . The same question was asked in 2003 , and this time it wasn ’ t 12 percent who considered themselves very important , it was 80 percent . ”
I was astonished . Even this “ correction ” isn ’ t correct ! Where is 1954 ? Where 's the 1989 ? In the interest of fact-checking , and a humility I assume Brooks would approve of , I should note , it is possible that a study was done in 2003 that had 80 percent of all respondents saying , `` Yes , it ’ s true , I am an important person . '' I ’ m still trying to find out .","For at least the past four years David Brooks, the New York Times columnist, TV pundit, bestselling author and lecture-circuit thought leader, has been publicly talking and writing about humility. Central to his thesis is the idea that humility has waned among Americans in recent years, and he wants us to harken to an earlier, better time.

One of the key talking points (if not the key talking point) cited by Brooks in lectures, interviews, and in the opening chapter of his current bestseller, “The Road to Character,” is a particular set of statistics -- one so resonant that in the wake of the book's release this spring, it has been seized upon by a seemingly endless number of reviewers and talking heads. There’s just one problem: Nearly every detail in this passage – which Brooks has repeated relentlessly, and which the media has echoed, also relentlessly -- is wrong.

My journey down the Brooks rabbit hole began around two years ago, when I was conducting research for my book “Invisibles: Celebrating the Unsung Heroes of the Workplace.” The book largely consists of long-form profiles of professionals who thrive behind the scenes, and a lot of time is spent positioning these people as counterpoints to our contemporary culture of attention. In setting a historical context, I argue that there has been a shift away from self-effacement toward one where gaining recognition seems to be prized above all else. It’s easy to see the dovetail with Brooks’ premise about a shift from humility.

So it was that I came across video of a lecture he had given at the 2011 Aspen Ideas Festival, where he stated:

In 1950 the Gallup Organization asked high school seniors “Are you a very important person?” And in 1950, 12 percent of high school seniors said yes. They asked the same question again in 2006; this time it wasn't 12 percent, it was 80 percent.

This seemed like a great stat to consider for my book, so I set about doing what I always aim to do when I come across a secondary source: I checked the facts. Before segueing to my current career as a writer, I spent about six or seven years as a magazine fact-checker, mostly for Condé Nast magazines; seeking primary sources for facts is my default mode.

I began by emailing a media contact at Gallup. After a series of exchanges, I was relayed to another Gallup employee. Ultimately I communicated directly with three different people at Gallup, and they communicated with multiple other staff, including a group in Princeton who combed Gallup’s print archives. During the process, a Gallup employee and I also emailed Brooks, but neither of us got a response. (Granted, I didn’t expect one, given that I had emailed his New York Times address, which likely receives a torrent of messages daily. I assume Brooks has another, more private email address he actually uses.) In their last email on the matter, the representatives at Gallup stated their final verdict: They did not “have any record of the data” that Brooks cited. But they also suggested that I try contacting Brooks again, and that if he shared any new information they would reopen the inquiry.

It was frustrating that they wouldn’t definitively just say Gallup didn’t conduct the polls Brooks cited, but if a number of people on the staff couldn’t find the polls then I knew either Gallup had atrocious record keeping, or Brooks was wrong. I hated that this tiny window of doubt was open, but there didn’t seem to be a path to find out one way or the other, so I gave up and didn’t include the passage in my book.

Fast forward to April 2015, when I came across a review of “The Road to Character” in the New York Times Book Review. To my amazement, the same statistic from the Aspen talk, once again credited to Gallup, was paraphrased. And my obsession with the mysterious Gallup poll roared back to life.

It was one thing if Brooks made erroneous claims in a one-off lecture. It was something else entirely to put those same claims in a book. Now I had to get to the bottom of this. I wanted to fact-check the review to make sure the reviewer was accurately quoting from the book. I did a search on Google Books for part of the quote and found it. After that, I went to Barnes and Noble and looked up the passage in the actual book just to confirm it was there.

The passage from “The Road to Character” reads:

""In 1950, the Gallup Organization asked high school seniors if they considered themselves to be a very important person. At that point, 12 percent said yes. The same question was asked in 2005, and this time it wasn’t 12 percent who considered themselves very important, it was 80 percent.""

Over the course of my search I discovered other iterations of the passage as well: During a 2011 appearance on “Real Time With Bill Maher,” for example, Brooks tells the same exact story, except in this telling, the second study took place not in 2005 or 2006, but in 1998.

The NYT's review of ""The Road to Character"" itself picked up the pattern of changing dates, when the reviewer noted that the passage in question was similar to one in an earlier Brooks book, “The Social Animal,” only it was written “with slightly different dates.”

The Yalie never replied, but I did get a response from his publicist, who told me that she had to check with Brooks, and that she would get back to me. It took over a week, but she replied with an admission that the study was wrongly ascribed to Gallup, but that the “sociological trend is accurate.” She also provided a link to what she said was the actual study (“Changes in Adolescent Response Patterns on the MMPI/MMPI-A Across Four Decades,” an analysis by university scholars of various data sets), and said the passage would be corrected in future printings of the book.

I then contacted two of the authors of the paper, Cassandra Newsom, a professor of pediatrics, psychiatry, & psychology at Vanderbilt University, and Robert Archer, a professor of psychiatry at Eastern Virginia Medical School. Abstracts and studies in general can be a challenge for the layperson to read, as academic text is often as opaque as legalese. So they sent me the actual paper and I went through it over the phone with Newsom. Here’s where things really began to unravel.

Newsom explained that, indeed, the first data set was from samples taken in 1948 and 1954, not 1950, and the second data set was from 1989, not 2005. Also, the first data set was exclusive to Minnesota, where respondents were disproportionately white, while the second was a more heterogeneous national sample. The respondents were not high school seniors, as Brooks wrote: In the ’48 and ’54 set, respondents were ninth graders; the 1989 sample was composed of 14- to 16-year-olds. (The ’48 and '54 data set was later sifted to match the 1989 set by including only ninth graders who were aged 14-16.) Lastly, in the 1989 set, 80 percent of boys answered “true” to the statement “I am an important person,” and 77 percent of girls said true. Yet Brooks cited 80 percent as the only figure. I asked Newsom if it was possible that some other study was done in 2005 with the same “I am an important person” question. She said there has not been another normative sample since 1989.

He merged a data set from 1948 and 1954 into 1950. He said the second data set was from 2005, when it was from 1989 (to me, the most damning and damaging inaccuracy). He said it was high school seniors, when it was ninth graders. And he said 80 percent answered true, when that was only so for boys. Can one accidentally get this many details wrong?

As I dug into the case, I watched the Aspen video again, while also referencing other lectures Brooks gave. Every time, he spoke with pith and humor; the audiences laughed and cheered along with his jokes and likably nebbishy demeanor. The guy knows what works.

As his publicist suggested, he may be right about the general trend. So why did he feel the need to gild the lily? Why couldn’t he have referenced the paper using the correct statistics? Perhaps it is a sign of his skill as a communicator, and his weakness, to know how to make a passage particularly seductive. On ""Morning Joe,"" as one of the hosts recited the erroneous passage, another host waved a cellphone, signaling, “See? This is the problem with today’s youth!” Saying 1989 for the latter date wouldn’t quite work for that bit.

In addition to his factual errors, it’s worth noting that Newsom and Archer challenge Brooks’ interpretation of their paper.

Archer said that the early sample may have interpreted the item as meaning “more important than others” whereas the '80s sample may have read it to mean “I believe I am a valuable person.” Further, though the authors compare a sample from Minnesotans to a national sample, it’s done so in a paper intended to be read and interpreted by academics, who can weigh the discrepancy. Mainstream readers would likely benefit from knowing the samples are not apples to apples, as Brooks’ citation implies.

We don ’ t yet know to what extent Donald Trump will succeed in remaking the United States , but his candidacy and presidency are already remaking American journalism .
It is not just that the ranting and raving on talk radio , on cable news , on websites , on Twitter have grown , if anything , louder . What ’ s more significant is how the political world ’ s encounter with Trump is changing our most respected journalism organizations—including the New York Times , the Washington Post , the network evening newscasts and CNN .
Yes , we have seen a new and welcome burst of investigative journalism at many of these news organs , as reporters have at the new administration ’ s generous supply of scandals and sort through an outraged bureaucracy ’ s abundant leaks about those scandals . But bursts of investigation come and go . The big news in American journalism today has been that reporters , editors and producers at legacy journalism organizations have become so eager to dispute the more questionable pronouncements and proposals of the Trump administration . Increasingly , they are prepared to label the president ’ s wilder statements and tweets “ falsehoods ” or even “ lies. ” The big news is that many of our best journalists seem , in news coverage , not just opinion pieces , to be moving away from balance and nonpartisanship .
Is this the end of all that is good and decent in American journalism ? Nah . I say good for them . An abandonment of the pretense to “ objectivity ” —in many ways a return to American journalism ’ s roots—is long overdue .
Journalism in the United States was born partisan and remained , for much of its history , loud , boisterous and combative . Note this appraisal of one of our presidents in the leading opposition newspaper of his time : “ If ever a nation was debauched by a man , the American nation has been debauched by … . . ” The commander in chief—and alleged debaucher—whose name completed this sentence ? George Washington .
This attack upon our now sainted first president was launched by a zealous anti-Federalist editor . Well into the 20th century , newspaper editors tended to be zealous something-or-others , and large numbers of the columns in their newspapers reflected their points of view . Horace Greeley , editor of the New York Tribune , was a Republican—a founding member of that party . Before and during the Civil War , Greeley ’ s Tribune was thoroughly Republican too .
And there were so many newspapers in a large city like New York , that there was room for one or more representing most political points of view . The journalistic market was thoroughly fractured . You attracted readers by being strawberry or butter pecan , not vanilla . Joseph Pulitzer , America ’ s leading publisher at the end of the 19th century , was passionately progressive , as was his newspaper , the New York World .
The man who would eventually do the most to bring nonpartisanship and balance to American journalism was Lowell Thomas—whose voice was heard on the country ’ s first network radio newscast beginning in 1930 . By 1941 , this one man was delivering the news every weekday evening to about 10 percent of the adult population of the United States . And Thomas reached many more through the newsreels he hosted , shown in movie theaters twice-weekly .
No rabble-rouser to begin with , Thomas intuited that the best way to hold this large audience was to avoid excessively offending any major political group . He tried to play it , as he put it , “ down the middle ” —not leaning , during the 1932 presidential campaign for instance , to Franklin Roosevelt or to President Herbert Hoover ( though Thomas himself was a Republican ) .
And Thomas ’ main successors in the role of national newsmen—David Brinkley , Walter Cronkite , Dan Rather , Tom Brokaw—aimed for somewhere around “ the middle ” too . The business model of network television newscasts , which required gathering an audience of millions for their advertisements , necessitated that they be “ trusted ” by Democrats and Republicans alike .
By the last third of the 20th century , America ’ s newspapers , their numbers shrunk by competition with broadcast news , were honoring a similar business model . It no longer made sense for the one , two or a few papers that had survived in a city to spread out on the political spectrum . Instead , they picked up the habit of reflexively pairing a quote from the Republicans with one from the Democrats . This is a variety of what the sharp-eyed and sardonic press critic A. J. Liebling once dubbed , “ on-the-one-hand-this , on-the-other-hand-that ” journalism .
Although it was the exception in the long history of American journalism , we have come to see this late-20th century journalism as “ traditional ” journalism . It was at least the journalism with which most of us grew up . And it did have one great advantage : the gravity and trust that often did flow from the mass audiences it attracted and its reputation for impartiality . That gave these news organs , on the rare occasions when they chose to exercise it , clout .
It is not clear that President Lyndon Johnson actually said in 1968 , “ If I ’ ve lost Cronkite , I ’ ve lost the country , ” after Walter Cronkite—then anchor of the CBS Evening News—returned from a visit to Vietnam with a belated and reluctant critique of the Vietnam War . But whether Johnson said it or not , Cronkite ’ s audience was so huge and he was so widely trusted that he could help turn the country against the war and the president who , with considerable dishonesty , was waging it . Same thing when another CBS newsman , Edward R. Murrow , had taken on the reckless Communist-hunting Senator Joe McCarthy .
A similar power was possessed by then almost universally respected newspapers like the Washington Post , which , in an earlier burst of investigative zeal , played a crucial role in exposing the Watergate scandal , or the New York Times , which was the first to publish the Pentagon Papers , questioning the premises of the Vietnam War .
But let ’ s not romanticize this era of mostly disinterested journalism . Given the fear of being caught possessing an opinion , pussyfooting abounded . And with so many journalism organizations clustered near “ the middle , ” the range of available viewpoints necessarily narrowed . On the seesaws reporters were so intent upon balancing , plenty of perspectives were denied seats : nonwhite and nonmale voices , anti-anti-Communist or anti-war opinions .
McCarthy had been leveling his wild charges for four years before Murrow took him on . The Vietnam War had been sinking toward a bloody stalemate and the Johnson administration had been dissembling about its causes , toll and futility for a few years before Cronkite spoke out against the war . When it was not investigating , American journalism—post-radio , pre-internet—leaned for the most part toward the vanilla .
One last point about the more temperate journalism of the late 20th century : It did not lead to a more temperate country . On the contrary , the 1960s and 1970s—near the height of American journalism ’ s infatuation with impartiality—were a time of protest marches , civil disobedience , assassinations and urban riots . Indeed , by failing to offer more diverse and radical voices access to its columns and microphones , mainstream 20th-century journalism may have compelled them to express themselves in the streets .
The audience for journalism fractured again in the 21st century . With hundreds of popular websites and Twitter feeds added to a few cable news networks , journalism began appearing in lots more interesting flavors : not just Fox News Channel and MSNBC , but the Drudge Report , Andrew Sullivan , the Daily Kos , Talking Points Memo , BuzzFeed , ███ , Breitbart , Vox.com , the Intercept , etc . In many corners of journalism good old-fashioned Horace Greeley- , Joseph Pulitzer-style partisanship reigned . Hence , the current cacophony .
Our legacy journalism organizations—including NBC , CBS , ABC , CNN , NPR , PBS , the Associated Press and most daily newspapers—were slow to recognize the new order and find their voices in the din . They continued to police themselves for tilts and biases and remained a little vanilla well into the 21st century . Indeed , their obsession with nonpartisanship lingered long enough to leave them deeply vulnerable to manipulation by a boisterous , rudderless presidential candidate like Trump .
Trump dissembled , most fact-checkers determined , with much greater frequency than other candidates . But could “ objective ” journalists actually declare that a major presidential candidate was lying ? For quite a while during the presidential campaign most shied away from the L word . Here , for example , are two mealy-mouthed euphemisms for Trumpian whoppers from one November 2015 article in the New York Times : “ salesmanlike stretches ” and “ questionable recollections. ” ( The article did eventually get around to noting that one Trump assertion was “ false . ” )
And it was presumably in the name of old-fashioned balance and nonpartisanship—bending over backward , in this case , not to slight the difficulties of Trump ’ s opponent , Hillary Clinton—that the New York Times made a decision that still sticks in the craw of some of the newspaper ’ s critics . Just a little more than one week before the election , the Times turned over the entire top half of its front page to stories surrounding FBI Director James Comey ’ s announcement that the FBI was to reopen its investigation of Democratic candidate Clinton ’ s emails because new emails might be found . New emails , we soon learned , were not found .
Many of those critics saw this as an example of “ false balance ” —equating Clinton ’ s minor transgression in having used a private email server for correspondence , some of which was classified , while secretary of state with Trump ’ s highly questionable and potentially more nefarious behavior : refusing to release his tax returns , failure to thoroughly divest himself of his business interests and adopting pro-Russian policies while members of his team apparently had significant financial relationships with entities connected to Russia and he was receiving considerable help in the campaign from Russian cyberwarfare directed at the Democrats .
And CNN , in its urge toward balance , seems to feel obligated to invite one or two reasonably telegenic Trump supporters to join many of its “ panels ” —sometimes seemingly for purpose of twisting logic into knots in support of an evidence-deficient Trump tweet .
It was not as if the Times , CNN and the other legacy news organizations gained much in the way of gravity and trust from such strained efforts at evenhandedness . If the mainstream media do not merely echo their man ’ s views , Trump supporters dismiss them as the “ liberal ” media , as , gallingly , “ fake news. ” In the second decade of the 21st century , it seems impossible to be trusted by many on all sides the way a Lowell Thomas was .
Indeed , in this fractured , partisan environment there is no Cronkite or Murrow who might bring down—however belatedly , however reluctantly—a Trump . No journalist today appears to possess the gravity and trust to shake a presidency—not Anderson Cooper or Matt Lauer and certainly not , unless they were to take on a president of their own persuasion , Rush Limbaugh or Rachel Maddow . A small percentage of Americans even know the name of the most recent anchor of the CBS Evening News , Scott Pelley . When 17 days after Trump ’ s inauguration , Pelley concluded on the air that Trump had made statements that were not just untrue but “ divorced from reality , ” it caused a minor fuss on Twitter and the Web—and not much else . Pelley ’ s willingness to attack the president with such vehemence seems not to have played any role—negative or positive—in the recent , presumably ratings-based decision to remove him as anchor of this newscast .
Instead journalists have had to grapple with the Trump administration not only the way Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein took on the Nixon administration—leak by leak , exposé by exposé—but by shucking off their shackles .
Our most respected mainstream journalism organizations are beginning to recognize the failings of nonpartisanship—its tepidness , its blind spots , its omissions , its evasions . It was news when the patriarch of American journalism , the New York Times , finally used the word “ lie , ” in a headline on atop its front page on September 17 , 2016 , to describe a Trump assertion ( albeit one he claimed no longer to hold : “ birtherism ” ) . Other legacy journalism organizations began more regularly calling out Trump ’ s “ falsehoods , ” if not actually accusing him of lying . About a week later , the Los Angeles Times declared , also on page one : “ Never in modern presidential politics has a major candidate made false statements as routinely as Trump has . ”
And these acknowledgements of Trump ’ s untruthfulness and wild accusations continue into his presidency : On April 5 , 2017 , the Times , reflecting the new order , quickly changed a headline online from “ Trump Says Susan Rice May Have Committed a Crime , ” to “ Trump , Citing No Evidence , Suggest Susan Rice Committed Crime. ” Pelley at CBS upped the ante with “ divorced from reality . ”
Journalists at many , perhaps most , mainstream journalism organizations now seem comfortable detailing the incompetence or dishonesty of the Trump administration without always feeling the need to quote someone contributing to the dishonesty by denying what is clearly true . The “ but ” in their stories , once routinely followed by a response to a charge , is now often followed by an extension of the charge , as in this lead paragraph from an Associated Press story picked up online by ABC News at the end of March : “ The White House ’ s handling of intelligence reports on the Russia investigation has been labeled unorthodox and , to the Democrats , suspicious . But when it comes to Trump ’ s relationship with his spy agencies , that 's par for the course . ”
When it comes to coverage of the Trump administration by mainstream American journalism organizations , the conclusion that there often is no credible response to the charges is becoming par for the course .
American journalism has been changing in front of our eyes . And even after historians have taken over from reporters the task of investigating the depredations of the Trump administration—the old “ on-the-one-hand-this , on-the-other-hand-that ” style of journalism is not coming back . The condition that created it—a limited supply of news organs , which sought large audiences by not offending—is gone . Its weaknesses are manifest . Journalists will not willingly slip that straightjacket back on . Our now unlimited supply of news organs is instead encouraging a robust , contentious style of journalism that George Washington might in some ways have recognized .
Better that journalists surrender the old pretense to objectivity entirely . Our best reporters must still dig and keep digging , check and double-check as they investigate . They must still be fair to those they cover and give credit or blame where due . But can ’ t we now acknowledge that the New York Times and the Washington Post—in their take on the news as well as in their editorials—are deeply skeptical about Trump ’ s presidency ? Is it not time for CNN and the others who are in that camp to own up to it , too ? Certainly , there is a roster of journalism organizations , albeit not as extensive and distinguished , on the other side . Why can ’ t all newspapers and news channels stop pussyfooting and own up to having something of a political point of view ?
Most other countries are comfortable with journalists who wield a well-honed perspective . In France , Le Monde has long been openly of the left and Le Figaro the right ; in England it ’ s the Guardian and the Telegraph . They all manage , with their biases , to be fine news organs . The democracies they monitor continue to function .
Having a take on events is no sin for a journalist . Presenting as reasonable an argument you know to be unreasonable is . How refreshing it is to see mainstream journalists beginning to realize that they no longer need pretend .","Mitchell Stephens, author of The Voice of America: Lowell Thomas and the Invention of 20th-Century Journalism, is a professor of journalism at New York University.

We don’t yet know to what extent Donald Trump will succeed in remaking the United States, but his candidacy and presidency are already remaking American journalism.

It is not just that the ranting and raving on talk radio, on cable news, on websites, on Twitter have grown, if anything, louder. What’s more significant is how the political world’s encounter with Trump is changing our most respected journalism organizations—including the New York Times, the Washington Post, the network evening newscasts and CNN.

Story Continued Below

Yes, we have seen a new and welcome burst of investigative journalism at many of these news organs, as reporters have at the new administration’s generous supply of scandals and sort through an outraged bureaucracy’s abundant leaks about those scandals. But bursts of investigation come and go. The big news in American journalism today has been that reporters, editors and producers at legacy journalism organizations have become so eager to dispute the more questionable pronouncements and proposals of the Trump administration. Increasingly, they are prepared to label the president’s wilder statements and tweets “falsehoods” or even “lies.” The big news is that many of our best journalists seem, in news coverage, not just opinion pieces, to be moving away from balance and nonpartisanship.

Is this the end of all that is good and decent in American journalism? Nah. I say good for them. An abandonment of the pretense to “objectivity”—in many ways a return to American journalism’s roots—is long overdue.

Journalism in the United States was born partisan and remained, for much of its history, loud, boisterous and combative. Note this appraisal of one of our presidents in the leading opposition newspaper of his time: “If ever a nation was debauched by a man, the American nation has been debauched by …. .” The commander in chief—and alleged debaucher—whose name completed this sentence? George Washington.

This attack upon our now sainted first president was launched by a zealous anti-Federalist editor. Well into the 20th century, newspaper editors tended to be zealous something-or-others, and large numbers of the columns in their newspapers reflected their points of view. Horace Greeley, editor of the New York Tribune, was a Republican—a founding member of that party. Before and during the Civil War, Greeley’s Tribune was thoroughly Republican too.

And there were so many newspapers in a large city like New York, that there was room for one or more representing most political points of view. The journalistic market was thoroughly fractured. You attracted readers by being strawberry or butter pecan, not vanilla. Joseph Pulitzer, America’s leading publisher at the end of the 19th century, was passionately progressive, as was his newspaper, the New York World.

This all changed in the 20th century.

The man who would eventually do the most to bring nonpartisanship and balance to American journalism was Lowell Thomas—whose voice was heard on the country’s first network radio newscast beginning in 1930. By 1941, this one man was delivering the news every weekday evening to about 10 percent of the adult population of the United States. And Thomas reached many more through the newsreels he hosted, shown in movie theaters twice-weekly.

No rabble-rouser to begin with, Thomas intuited that the best way to hold this large audience was to avoid excessively offending any major political group. He tried to play it, as he put it, “down the middle”—not leaning, during the 1932 presidential campaign for instance, to Franklin Roosevelt or to President Herbert Hoover (though Thomas himself was a Republican).

And Thomas’ main successors in the role of national newsmen—David Brinkley, Walter Cronkite, Dan Rather, Tom Brokaw—aimed for somewhere around “the middle” too. The business model of network television newscasts, which required gathering an audience of millions for their advertisements, necessitated that they be “trusted” by Democrats and Republicans alike.

By the last third of the 20th century, America’s newspapers, their numbers shrunk by competition with broadcast news, were honoring a similar business model. It no longer made sense for the one, two or a few papers that had survived in a city to spread out on the political spectrum. Instead, they picked up the habit of reflexively pairing a quote from the Republicans with one from the Democrats. This is a variety of what the sharp-eyed and sardonic press critic A. J. Liebling once dubbed, “on-the-one-hand-this, on-the-other-hand-that” journalism.

Although it was the exception in the long history of American journalism, we have come to see this late-20th century journalism as “traditional” journalism. It was at least the journalism with which most of us grew up. And it did have one great advantage: the gravity and trust that often did flow from the mass audiences it attracted and its reputation for impartiality. That gave these news organs, on the rare occasions when they chose to exercise it, clout.

It is not clear that President Lyndon Johnson actually said in 1968, “If I’ve lost Cronkite, I’ve lost the country,” after Walter Cronkite—then anchor of the CBS Evening News—returned from a visit to Vietnam with a belated and reluctant critique of the Vietnam War. But whether Johnson said it or not, Cronkite’s audience was so huge and he was so widely trusted that he could help turn the country against the war and the president who, with considerable dishonesty, was waging it. Same thing when another CBS newsman, Edward R. Murrow, had taken on the reckless Communist-hunting Senator Joe McCarthy.

A similar power was possessed by then almost universally respected newspapers like the Washington Post, which, in an earlier burst of investigative zeal, played a crucial role in exposing the Watergate scandal, or the New York Times, which was the first to publish the Pentagon Papers, questioning the premises of the Vietnam War.

But let’s not romanticize this era of mostly disinterested journalism. Given the fear of being caught possessing an opinion, pussyfooting abounded. And with so many journalism organizations clustered near “the middle,” the range of available viewpoints necessarily narrowed. On the seesaws reporters were so intent upon balancing, plenty of perspectives were denied seats: nonwhite and nonmale voices, anti-anti-Communist or anti-war opinions.

McCarthy had been leveling his wild charges for four years before Murrow took him on. The Vietnam War had been sinking toward a bloody stalemate and the Johnson administration had been dissembling about its causes, toll and futility for a few years before Cronkite spoke out against the war. When it was not investigating, American journalism—post-radio, pre-internet—leaned for the most part toward the vanilla.

One last point about the more temperate journalism of the late 20th century: It did not lead to a more temperate country. On the contrary, the 1960s and 1970s—near the height of American journalism’s infatuation with impartiality—were a time of protest marches, civil disobedience, assassinations and urban riots. Indeed, by failing to offer more diverse and radical voices access to its columns and microphones, mainstream 20th-century journalism may have compelled them to express themselves in the streets.

The audience for journalism fractured again in the 21st century. With hundreds of popular websites and Twitter feeds added to a few cable news networks, journalism began appearing in lots more interesting flavors: not just Fox News Channel and MSNBC, but the Drudge Report, Andrew Sullivan, the Daily Kos, Talking Points Memo, BuzzFeed, POLITICO, Breitbart, Vox.com, the Intercept, etc. In many corners of journalism good old-fashioned Horace Greeley-, Joseph Pulitzer-style partisanship reigned. Hence, the current cacophony.

Our legacy journalism organizations—including NBC, CBS, ABC, CNN, NPR, PBS, the Associated Press and most daily newspapers—were slow to recognize the new order and find their voices in the din. They continued to police themselves for tilts and biases and remained a little vanilla well into the 21st century. Indeed, their obsession with nonpartisanship lingered long enough to leave them deeply vulnerable to manipulation by a boisterous, rudderless presidential candidate like Trump.

Trump dissembled, most fact-checkers determined, with much greater frequency than other candidates. But could “objective” journalists actually declare that a major presidential candidate was lying? For quite a while during the presidential campaign most shied away from the L word. Here, for example, are two mealy-mouthed euphemisms for Trumpian whoppers from one November 2015 article in the New York Times: “salesmanlike stretches” and “questionable recollections.” (The article did eventually get around to noting that one Trump assertion was “false.”)

And it was presumably in the name of old-fashioned balance and nonpartisanship—bending over backward, in this case, not to slight the difficulties of Trump’s opponent, Hillary Clinton—that the New York Times made a decision that still sticks in the craw of some of the newspaper’s critics. Just a little more than one week before the election, the Times turned over the entire top half of its front page to stories surrounding FBI Director James Comey’s announcement that the FBI was to reopen its investigation of Democratic candidate Clinton’s emails because new emails might be found. New emails, we soon learned, were not found.

Many of those critics saw this as an example of “false balance”—equating Clinton’s minor transgression in having used a private email server for correspondence, some of which was classified, while secretary of state with Trump’s highly questionable and potentially more nefarious behavior: refusing to release his tax returns, failure to thoroughly divest himself of his business interests and adopting pro-Russian policies while members of his team apparently had significant financial relationships with entities connected to Russia and he was receiving considerable help in the campaign from Russian cyberwarfare directed at the Democrats.

And CNN, in its urge toward balance, seems to feel obligated to invite one or two reasonably telegenic Trump supporters to join many of its “panels”—sometimes seemingly for purpose of twisting logic into knots in support of an evidence-deficient Trump tweet.

It was not as if the Times, CNN and the other legacy news organizations gained much in the way of gravity and trust from such strained efforts at evenhandedness. If the mainstream media do not merely echo their man’s views, Trump supporters dismiss them as the “liberal” media, as, gallingly, “fake news.” In the second decade of the 21st century, it seems impossible to be trusted by many on all sides the way a Lowell Thomas was.

Indeed, in this fractured, partisan environment there is no Cronkite or Murrow who might bring down—however belatedly, however reluctantly—a Trump. No journalist today appears to possess the gravity and trust to shake a presidency—not Anderson Cooper or Matt Lauer and certainly not, unless they were to take on a president of their own persuasion, Rush Limbaugh or Rachel Maddow. A small percentage of Americans even know the name of the most recent anchor of the CBS Evening News, Scott Pelley. When 17 days after Trump’s inauguration, Pelley concluded on the air that Trump had made statements that were not just untrue but “divorced from reality,” it caused a minor fuss on Twitter and the Web—and not much else. Pelley’s willingness to attack the president with such vehemence seems not to have played any role—negative or positive—in the recent, presumably ratings-based decision to remove him as anchor of this newscast.

Instead journalists have had to grapple with the Trump administration not only the way Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein took on the Nixon administration—leak by leak, exposé by exposé—but by shucking off their shackles.

Our most respected mainstream journalism organizations are beginning to recognize the failings of nonpartisanship—its tepidness, its blind spots, its omissions, its evasions. It was news when the patriarch of American journalism, the New York Times, finally used the word “lie,” in a headline on atop its front page on September 17, 2016, to describe a Trump assertion (albeit one he claimed no longer to hold: “birtherism”). Other legacy journalism organizations began more regularly calling out Trump’s “falsehoods,” if not actually accusing him of lying. About a week later, the Los Angeles Times declared, also on page one: “Never in modern presidential politics has a major candidate made false statements as routinely as Trump has.”

And these acknowledgements of Trump’s untruthfulness and wild accusations continue into his presidency: On April 5, 2017, the Times, reflecting the new order, quickly changed a headline online from “Trump Says Susan Rice May Have Committed a Crime,” to “Trump, Citing No Evidence, Suggest Susan Rice Committed Crime.” Pelley at CBS upped the ante with “divorced from reality.”

Journalists at many, perhaps most, mainstream journalism organizations now seem comfortable detailing the incompetence or dishonesty of the Trump administration without always feeling the need to quote someone contributing to the dishonesty by denying what is clearly true. The “but” in their stories, once routinely followed by a response to a charge, is now often followed by an extension of the charge, as in this lead paragraph from an Associated Press story picked up online by ABC News at the end of March: “The White House’s handling of intelligence reports on the Russia investigation has been labeled unorthodox and, to the Democrats, suspicious. But when it comes to Trump’s relationship with his spy agencies, that's par for the course.”

When it comes to coverage of the Trump administration by mainstream American journalism organizations, the conclusion that there often is no credible response to the charges is becoming par for the course.

American journalism has been changing in front of our eyes. And even after historians have taken over from reporters the task of investigating the depredations of the Trump administration—the old “on-the-one-hand-this, on-the-other-hand-that” style of journalism is not coming back. The condition that created it—a limited supply of news organs, which sought large audiences by not offending—is gone. Its weaknesses are manifest. Journalists will not willingly slip that straightjacket back on. Our now unlimited supply of news organs is instead encouraging a robust, contentious style of journalism that George Washington might in some ways have recognized.

Better that journalists surrender the old pretense to objectivity entirely. Our best reporters must still dig and keep digging, check and double-check as they investigate. They must still be fair to those they cover and give credit or blame where due. But can’t we now acknowledge that the New York Times and the Washington Post—in their take on the news as well as in their editorials—are deeply skeptical about Trump’s presidency? Is it not time for CNN and the others who are in that camp to own up to it, too? Certainly, there is a roster of journalism organizations, albeit not as extensive and distinguished, on the other side. Why can’t all newspapers and news channels stop pussyfooting and own up to having something of a political point of view?

Most other countries are comfortable with journalists who wield a well-honed perspective. In France, Le Monde has long been openly of the left and Le Figaro the right; in England it’s the Guardian and the Telegraph. They all manage, with their biases, to be fine news organs. The democracies they monitor continue to function.

Having a take on events is no sin for a journalist. Presenting as reasonable an argument you know to be unreasonable is. How refreshing it is to see mainstream journalists beginning to realize that they no longer need pretend.",www.politico.com,left,nmzItGxYwshm0XZY

On Monday , the New York Times ran a piece which quotes its own executive editor , Dean Baquet , admitting that the paper was wrong to underplay the latest rape allegation against President Donald Trump . “ We were overly cautious , ” says Baquet .
On Friday , New York Magazine ran an excerpt of writer E. Jean Carroll ’ s memoir , in which Carroll accuses Trump of holding her against the wall of a department store dressing room , pulling off her tights , and forcing his penis into her vagina .
Though the Times did run a short piece acknowledging Carroll ’ s allegation on Friday evening , it “ did not promote the story on its home page until late Saturday morning and did not run a print story until Sunday , ” according to the Times ’ own coverage of its decision to downplay the story .
The Times said that it decided not to give more attention to this alleged rape because the story did not meet an “ informal set of guidelines ” the paper developed for sexual assault allegations — guidelines that developed out of the paper ’ s own coverage of allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein and former Fox News host Bill O ’ Reilly .
“ Those guidelines include locating sources outside those mentioned by the accusers who not only corroborate the allegations but also are willing to go on the record . ”
There are many reasons why these informal guidelines led the Times to make bad decisions on this particular story — more on that later . But , since Baquet acknowledges that the Times was overcautious here , it ’ s worth noting what happened several years ago when the Times abandoned all caution in its coverage of one particular story .
In December 2017 , the Columbia Journalism Review ( CJR ) published a simply astounding study examining how several major journalistic outlets covered the 2016 race between Trump and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton . The study looked at each of the 13,481 articles published by the Times in the 69 days leading up to the election , with special attention paid to any story that appeared on the printed newspaper ’ s front page . Each story that mentioned the presidential election was then classified as a “ policy ” story , a “ personal/scandal ” story , or a “ campaign miscellaneous ” story that neither discussed policy nor scandal .
The results were damning . Among other things , the study found that “ in just six days , The New York Times ran as many cover stories about Hillary Clinton ’ s emails as they did about all policy issues combined in the 69 days leading up to the election . ”
Beyond the Times ’ apparent obsession with Her Emails , the study found that the paper of record virtually ignored each candidates ’ policy positions altogether . “ Of the 1,433 articles that mentioned Trump or Clinton , 291 were devoted to scandals or other personal matters while only 70 mentioned policy , and of these only 60 mentioned any details of either candidate ’ s positions. ” In total , only 16 front page stories mentioned policy at all , and of those “ six had no details ” and “ four provided details on Trump ’ s policy only . ”
Meanwhile , Trump campaigned on a promise to strip health coverage from millions of people .
Another story that also received substantially less coverage than Her Emails was a videotape on which Trump openly bragged about being a serial sexual predator . During a 2005 conversation with Access Hollywood ’ s Billy Bush , Trump admitted that he would “ just start kissing ” women without their consent , and that he would “ grab ’ em by the pussy. ” This story broke in The Washington Post shortly before the election .
A group of Harvard and MIT researchers looked at the Times and several of its peer outlets , and evaluated each individual sentence that appeared in these outlets ’ coverage of the 2016 election . According to CJR , they “ found roughly four times as many Clinton-related sentences that described scandals as opposed to policies , whereas Trump-related sentences were one-and-a-half times as likely to be about policy as scandal . ”
Meanwhile , “ the various Clinton-related email scandals—her use of a private email server while secretary of state , as well as the DNC and John Podesta hacks—accounted for more sentences than all of Trump ’ s scandals combined ( 65,000 vs. 40,000 ) and more than twice as many as were devoted to all of her policy positions. ” ( John Podesta is a founder of the Center for American Progress . ███ is an editorially independent news site housed at the Center for American Progress Action Fund . )
Her Emails , in other words , received more coverage than Trump admitting on video that he is a sexual predator plus all other Trump-related scandals put together . The New York Times ’ caution in the face of sexual assault allegations against Trump — at least as compared to its unconstrained mania to cover Her Emails — is not a new phenomenon . It did not manifest suddenly after the 16th woman stepped forward to accuse Trump of sexual predation . It ’ s driven its coverage of Trump from the beginning .
A quick word should be made on why the Times ’ informal guidelines all but ensured that it would underplay the Carroll investigation . Recall that those guidelines ask the paper to look for “ sources outside those mentioned by the accusers who not only corroborate the allegations but also are willing to go on the record . ”
It ’ s a very common practice , when someone makes a sexual assault allegation years after the alleged assault took place , for journalists to ask whether accusers told anyone about the assault shortly after it happened . When an accuser confides in someone before the assault allegation becomes newsworthy ( or , in Trump ’ s case , more newsworthy ) that lends credibility to an allegation and suggests that the is accuser is telling the truth .
In Carroll ’ s case , she says that she told “ two close friends , ” and the Times says that it spoke to these two women and they “ both confirmed that Ms. Carroll had described the incident to them , but asked for their names to be withheld . ”
The problem with looking for “ sources outside those mentioned by the accusers ” is that such a guideline all but ensures that the Times will underreport rape allegations . To meet this standard , Carroll could have had to tell four people of her alleged rape , then withhold two of those people from everyone but The New York Times . That ’ s a ridiculous burden for the Times to place on someone who discloses a past trauma .
To its credit , the Times now admits that its informal guidelines misled its coverage . The fact that a prominent writer accused a sitting president of rape , Baquet now says , “ should ’ ve compelled us to play it bigger . ”
But where is the Times ’ apology for its decision to treat the fact that Hillary Clinton used a personal email account to conduct work business as a much bigger story than the fact that Donald Trump admitted to sexual assault on camera ? Where is the apology for the Times ’ decision to treat Her Emails as the single biggest issue of 2016 — far bigger than all policy matters combined ?
The price of the Times ’ 2016 malpractice is catastrophic . In an election as close as 2016 , every factor mattered . And even the smallest changes may have led to a different result . Clinton , after all , won the popular vote by nearly 3 million ballots . And , as Tina Nguyen noted in Vanity Fair shortly after the election , “ you could fit all the voters who cost Clinton the election in a mid-sized football stadium . ”
Had the nation ’ s preeminent newspaper made minimally competent decisions about which stories to emphasize and which ones to downplay in 2016 , it is very likely that Hillary Clinton would be president of the United States .
In that world , children are likely not being held in American internment camps . Trump officials are not sabotaging Obamacare . The U.S.-Iran nuclear deal is still in full effect , and the United States and Iran are not teetering on the edge of war . Neil Gorsuch isn ’ t quietly gathering the votes he needs to render the Environmental Protection Agency impotent . Congress did not give a massive tax giveaway to the richest Americans .

The Sunday morning shows once occupied a sacred space in American politics.

Today, many influential Washington players can’t even remember the last time they watched.

Story Continued Below

The public affairs shows — “Meet the Press,” “Face the Nation” and “This Week” — used to set the agenda for the nation’s capital with their news-making interviews and immensely influential audience. Now the buzz around the shows is more likely to center on gossipy criticism about the hosts, notably “Meet the Press’s” David Gregory, whose fate has become an incessant subject of conversation, most recently in a Washington Post story on Monday. Meanwhile, fans complain about the recurrence of familiar guests — Sen. John McCain again? — who simply relay party talking points that often go unchallenged.

“For political junkies and those who just want to catch up, the Sunday shows still are relevant, but they’re not the signature events they once were,” Tom Brokaw, the NBC News veteran who briefly moderated “Meet the Press” in 2008, said in an interview. “I first appeared on ‘Meet the Press’ during Watergate, and it was a secular mass in Washington; the faithful never missed it.”

Political veterans, congressional aides, former administration officials and longtime journalists all attested to the Sunday shows’ decline. The programs are no longer the agenda-setting platforms of days past, they said. Instead, the broadcasts have become a venue for lawmakers to push familiar talking points and for talking heads to exchange conventional wisdom. Occasionally there is an interview or discussion that will make headlines — Vice President Joe Biden’s endorsement of gay marriage, which preceded President Barack Obama’s own announcement, comes to mind. But that has become the exception rather than the rule.

Not surprisingly, the few who adamantly insist that the programs are relevant are the hosts and producers.

“I do not agree that ‘Meet the Press’ is not what it has always been, which is a driver of the conversation,” said David Gregory, the current host, echoing remarks made by ABC’s George Stephanopoulos and CBS’s Bob Schieffer. “Administration figures, politicians and candidates come to ‘Meet the Press’ because they know what ‘Meet the Press’ represents.”

Increasingly, what “Meet the Press” and its competitors represent are still-powerful brands struggling to maintain influence in a radically changed media environment, where news consumption is more fast-paced and fractured than ever and “the news cycle” these shows used to command no longer really exists.

Since the death of former “Meet the Press” host Tim Russert in 2008, there has been much hemming and hawing over the quality of the Sunday show hosts, none of whom have a reputation for tough interviews. Gregory has particularly suffered in the press; on Monday, The Washington Post Style section published what amounts to the latest installment in the host’s rolling public relations disaster under the headline, “What’s Wrong With David Gregory?”

Gregory doesn’t put much stock in the criticism, saying, “If I could figure out why certain perceptions existed, I wouldn’t have time to do my job.”

But complaints about the hosts overlook a dire reality, which is that the changed media environment has dealt a severe blow to the Sunday institution itself. In an era of 24-hour news delivered through digital snippets, the historic influence of the weekend morning shows may now be irrecoverable.

The Obama administration has turned an especially cold shoulder to the programs. Past administrations would dole out key newsmakers almost every week. The George W. Bush administration frequently sent the likes of Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and others on the show in an effort to shape the national conversation.

“When I was at the White House and on the Hill, Sunday shows were either the exclamation point at the end of a week or the capital letter that began a new week. Today, they’re part of the endless dot, dot, dots that are part of political coverage,” said Ari Fleischer, the former White House press secretary. “There is so much news and so many outlets, even quality Sunday shows don’t break through like they use to.”

Journalists recognize the change as well.

“The news cycle moves so quickly and with so many diverse entry points for quality political news that it is difficult for the Sunday shows, as they once did, to ‘drive’ the week’s political news,” Jill Abramson, the executive editor of The New York Times, wrote in an email. “A week is now eternity, after all.”

That reality has radically altered the way politicians use the Sunday programs. In the past, the platform was so influential that presidential administrations and lawmakers met nearly every week to strategically plan out appearances, hoping to impact the latest political or policy debate.

He did it again late last month , during the flap over a Black bird watcher in Central Park and a white Hillary Clinton voter who dialed 911 after refusing his pleas to leash her dog . Jones enraged Hillary loyalists—already exasperated by his willingness to concede her flaws as a 2016 presidential candidate in televised food nights with Trump acolyte Kayleigh McEnany—when he compared Clinton supporters unfavorably to the Klan .
“ It ’ s not the racist white person who ’ s in the Ku Klux Klan that we have to worry about , ” Jones said on CNN ’ s New Day . “ It ’ s the white liberal Hillary Clinton supporter walking her dog in Central Park… But the minute she sees a Black man , who she does not respect , or has a slight thought against , she weaponized race like she had been trained by the Aryan Nation . ”
More recently , on June 16 , the 51-year-old Jones—a Yale Law School-trained attorney and former green energy jobs adviser in the Obama administration—provoked even more liberal distress and anger when he ladled praise on a so-called police reform initiative by President Donald Trump .
Jones went on CNN ’ s Inside Politics with John King and Anderson Cooper 360 to enthusiastically commend Trump ’ s executive order—even as it was being criticized as cynical and unproductive by the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and “ delusional ” by the Color of Change , an influential racial justice organization that Jones himself co-founded in 2005 .
CNN viewers weren ’ t informed that he had actually participated in secret discussions with his new friend Jared Kushner on ways to frame the presidential project .
“ In a tough situation Van has shown me that he ’ s got true character . He ’ s focused on the right things . ” — Jared Kushner to The ███
According to a knowledgeable White House source , who expressed satisfaction that there were zero leaks , Jones and California human rights attorney Jessica Jackson , who runs # cut50 , a prison-reform group that Jones also founded , actively participated with law enforcement officials and White House staffers to help fashion the order and guide the politics of the discussion to what they considered “ the sweet spot ” between law enforcement and “ the reasonable middle ” and “ the reasonable left . ”
Skyping from his Los Angeles home , with a biography of Nelson Mandela and a Black Panther graphic novel visible on the bookshelf behind him , Jones told viewers of CNN ’ s noon show Inside Politics : “ The executive order is a good thing , mainly because you saw the support of law enforcement there ... There is movement in the direction of a database for bad cops . We have never had a federal database for bad cops , that ’ s why all these cops go all over the place doing bad stuff… The chokeholds , that ’ s common ground now between Nancy Pelosi and Trump . Good stuff there . ”
Hours later , Jones doubled down on Anderson Cooper 360—again without disclosing his role advising the Trump White House . “ What do you make of this executive order ? ” Cooper asked him .
“ I think it ’ s pushing in the right direction , ” Jones told the CNN anchor . “ What you got today is , I think , a sign that we are winning , ” he added . “ Donald Trump has put himself on record saying we need to reform the police department… We are winning ! Donald Trump had no plan a month ago to work on this issue at all . The fact that we are now in the direction of moving forward , I think , is good . ”
After the publication of this story , Jones denied that he was involved in crafting the police reform order , tweeting : “ I have never been included in any meetings about police reform ( not by phone , zoom , nada ) . I didn ’ t know what was in the EO until the day it was released . ”
Jones additionally claimed the article was “ false ” because he hasn ’ t been to D.C. since before the coronavirus pandemic . “ The accusation that I attended White House meetings on police reform but failed to disclose them is doubly false , and it should be corrected , ” he wrote .
But the White House source with knowledge said that “ just recently , on the police reform executive order , Van and Jessica and the Reform Alliance , had been working with a lot of the families of people who had been killed by police officers , and we worked very closely with them on the EO . ”
The source added : “ On the EO , I would say he and Jessica were very helpful . ”
“ Van worked with us on fashioning things , ” the source continued . “ Having Van ’ s and Jessica ’ s perspective , they knew where the crazy people on the left were , they knew where the reasonable people on the left were , and everywhere in between . And they were helpful in guiding us to a sweet spot where we were able to speak with law enforcement but also do something that a lot of reasonable people in the middle and the reasonable left thought was a major step forward . ”
During a Rose Garden ceremony that was actually a Trump campaign event—at which the president defended the police , touted his commitment to “ law and order , ” boasted about the stock market and the pre-coronavirus economy , and attacked Joe Biden—Trump was flanked by uniformed officers and police union officials as he signed the executive order in response to the pandemic of unjustified killings of unarmed Black Americans by white cops .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was quick to call the event “ a photo op ” and the executive order “ seriously short of what is required ” ; Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer panned it as “ weak tea ” and the Rev . Al Sharpton—a longtime ally of Jones going back to the 1990s , when Jones was a self-avowed “ radical ” and social justice activist in Oakland—derided it as “ toothless and meaningless ” because it gives lip service , but no legal mandate , to banning chokeholds ( unless officers decide their lives are at risk ) , improving police training , making use of mental health professionals , and keeping a national registry of bad cops .
“ I did not think the executive order was worth the paper it was written on , ” Sharpton told The ███ . “ Van ’ s experiment with Trump is a case of him having more faith than I have , but I ’ m not going to attack him for doing it…I think he ’ s well-intentioned , but I think he totally underestimates the kind of guy he ’ s dealing with . I just disagree that the people he ’ s dealing with have a sincere bone in their body . But I can ’ t fault him for trying . ”
Among Jones ’ many critics on the left , actor Jeffrey Wright was at once harsh and perceptive as he watched Jones compliment Trump ’ s policing initiative : “ Smells like Van Jones helped Kushner craft this exec order , so he touts it . ‘ You ca n't polish this turd , ’ he said of Trump ’ s delinquency , yet here he is with boot black & rag , ” Wright tweeted .
“ Jones ’ job appears to be making Republican policy palatable to black people . So expect him to call this new proposal progress , ” wrote Jones detractor Stephen A. Crockett Jr. , a columnist for The Root . Quoting Malcom X , Crockett added sarcastically : “ ‘ Hey look , the knife went from being 9 inches in your back to being only 6 inches in your back , ’ ( Van Jones ’ voice ) . ”
Neither Sherrilyn Ifill , president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund , nor Rashad Robinson , executive director of Color of Change , responded to interview requests . Jones , meanwhile , declined to speak to The ███ before publication of this story . A member of his public relations staff explained that “ due to his contractual obligations with CNN/Turner , he ’ s limited in what press he can do outside of their network . ”
CNN , meanwhile , wouldn ’ t comment on the network ’ s failure to disclose Jones ’ s behind-the-scenes advisory role in shaping Trump ’ s executive order while offering accolades for an initiative he helped create .
The circumstance was similar in kind , if not in degree , to an infamous incident 40 years ago in which Washington Post columnist George F. Will praised Ronald Reagan ’ s debate performance against President Jimmy Carter without disclosing that Will had helped coach the then-Republican nominee in debate practice sessions .
“ I find that in politics , people get in uncomfortable situations , and that ’ s when you get to see what a person ’ s character really is , ” Kushner told The ███ during a brief phone conversation . “ And in a tough situation Van has shown me that he ’ s got true character . He ’ s focused on the right things . ”
“ [ Van ] Jones ’ job appears to be making Republican policy palatable to black people . ” — Stephen A. Crockett Jr. , columnist for The Root
By one knowledgeable account , it was CNN ’ s politics czar , Sam Feist , the network ’ s Washington bureau chief and senior vice president , who introduced Kushner to Jones ; at the time Jones was oscillating between making positive noises about Trump , who happens to be Kushner ’ s father-in-law , and trashing the new president .
“ Donald Trump is a horrific jackass , ” Jones said during a February 2017 speech at John Jay College ’ s Center on Media , Crime and Justice . “ He ’ s one of the worst people ever born . He is . You can ’ t be any worse than him , unless you like chopping the heads off of small kittens every day . I don ’ t know what you could do to be worse . ”
Barely a week later , Jones effusively praised a moment in Trump ’ s first State of the Union address when he led a lengthy standing ovation for the widow of Navy SEAL Ryan Owens—who was killed in a botched and ill-planned military adventure in Yemen ( a failure for which Trump had typically blamed Barack Obama ) .
“ He became president of the United States in that moment . Period , ” Jones claimed . “ [ T ] hat was one of the most extraordinary moments you have ever seen in American politics . Period…For people who had been hoping that he would become unifying , hoping that he might find some way to become presidential , they should be happy with that moment. ” ( In an interview last year with The ███ ’ s Marlow Stern , Jones declared defiantly that he remains “ proud ” of that wildly hyperbolic and hardly prophetic assessment . )
Kushner—who became interested in criminal justice and prison reform after his father , New Jersey real estate magnate Charles Kushner , was sent to the federal pen in 2005 for campaign finance violations , tax evasion , and witness tampering—told CNN ’ s Feist that the White House was planning to roll out a criminal justice reform policy initiative and pleaded for fair coverage from CNN .
Feist recommended that he speak to Jones , telling Kushner that the CNN personality was passionate about the issue .
“ He was someone I ’ d seen on television , so I was deeply skeptical , ” Kushner told The ███ . “ But I said I ’ d be happy to speak to him , and we had a good chat . And then we just started working together . And what I saw , with him , was that he had a lot of courage , when other people play politics . ”
By most accounts , Kushner and Jones became fast friends ; Jones has been an occasional dinner guest of Jared and Ivanka Trump at their mansion in Washington ’ s posh Kalorama neighborhood , and Kushner introduced Jones to Kim Kardashian West , a longtime pal—along with her husband Kanye—of Ivanka ’ s .
In May 2018 , Kardashian West had successfully lobbied Trump to pardon Alice Marie Johnson , a 63-year-old Black woman who had spent more than two decades in prison while serving a life sentence on nonviolent drug charges . In short order Jones— who beyond being a talented communicator is a world-class networker—befriended the reality television star , encouraged her interest in prison reform and arranged for her to study law , with an eye toward taking the California bar exam , under the tutelage of # cut50 ’ s Jessica Jackson .
“ I met Van several years ago and I ’ m honored to call him both a friend and mentor , ” Kardashian West told The ███ in a statement . “ I ’ ve seen firsthand his commitment to helping those in need and his dedication , as founder of The Dream Corps [ Jones ’ umbrella non-profit ] , to empowering the most vulnerable in our society . Van has encouraged my passion on prison reform and he ’ s one of the first people I call for advice . I will forever be inspired by Van ’ s selfless work . ”
Over the years , Jones had made friends with a glittering list of celebrities , including Jay-Z , Rosario Dawson , and Prince ( a financial backer of Jones ’ s projects ; Jones shed tears during several television appearances memorializing the iconic rock star who died in April 2016 ) .
Jones also has counted among his pals Meghan McCain , Kayleigh McEnany , Mike Huckabee , and his former partners on CNN ’ s brief reboot of Crossfire in 2013 , former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich and the right-leaning yet Trump-loathing cable personality S.E . Cupp .
“ Van is solution-oriented , ” Cupp told The ███ . “ So he ’ s not all that interested in the politics of where that solution comes from , or even optics…Very few of us in the pundit space can claim actual policy wings , so I think his willingness to hear anyone out is a virtue . ”
Indeed , South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott , the Senate ’ s only Black Republican , consulted with Jones as he drafted police reform legislation , the so-called “ Justice Act , ” that Democratic critics have called woefully inadequate and effectively killed in the Senate .
“ They did talk during the process of putting our police reform legislation together , ” Scott ’ s spokesperson emailed , “ and Van shared ideas for our team to consider . The JUSTICE Act was truly built up from bipartisan goals , and Van ’ s input was certainly a part of the process as we constructed the bill . ”
“ I will forever be inspired by Van ’ s selfless work . ” — Kim Kardashian West to The ███
Several associates of Jones , who asked not to be identified so they could speak freely , speculated to The ███ that Jones , a divorced father of two , is motivated as much by personal advancement , fame and access to power and money as by altruism .
One former colleague described a vehicle dubbed the “ Van Jones Media Machine , ” in which Jones owns and operates his own production company , Magic Labs Media LLC , writes books , gives paid speeches , and oversees an array of non-profits as chief executive of the REFORM Alliance , which Jones ’ s official bio describes as “ an initiative founded by Jay-Z , Meek Mill and six billionaires to transform the criminal justice system . ”
For the past three years , Jones ’ s media career has been managed by the Jay-Z-founded entertainment company , Roc Nation LLC . Apparently he has been doing well enough financially with all his entrepreneurial enterprises to give up his salary as president of Dream Corps , which paid him $ 209,469 in 2016 , $ 145,541 in 2017 and nothing in 2018 , according to the tax-exempt nonprofit ’ s public financial information .
Jones ’ s brief tenure in 2009 as special adviser on green jobs with Obama ’ s Council on Environmental Quality ended abruptly with his resignation after then-Fox News personality Glenn Beck relentlessly attacked him for his post-law school past as a radical leftist who honored Maoist ideology—a phase Jones ultimately rejected to work within the mainstream political system .
Beck probably did Jones a huge favor by making him a cause célèbre . Jones , by some accounts , had been frustrated at being a mere cog in the Obama White House , and was acutely annoyed that White House senior environmental adviser Brian Deese , a younger man who happened to be white , had more clout with the first Black president than Jones did . Deese , these days a managing director and global head of sustainable investing for the asset-management behemoth BlackRock , didn ’ t respond to a request for comment .
Ironically , Jones has enjoyed far greater access to Donald Trump and his most powerful adviser , Jared Kushner , than he ever did to Barack Obama and Obama ’ s top aides .
“ He goes places where others fear to go , and he is crucified in many ways for the decisions that he makes , but understands that this work is the work of our Creator , ” said prison reform activist Topeka Sam , who met Jones at a Google event and began to work with him in 2016 after serving three years of a 10-year sentence on a federal non-violent drug conspiracy conviction . “ We have to work with each other in order to get things changed , and have a better and just society . ”
Yet Sam , too , initially resisted Jones ’ s invitation to join him in meetings at the Trump White House : “ When Van invited me to the White House , I did not go the first time because people said don ’ t go , you don ’ t work with this administration , and nothing ’ s going to come of it…I didn ’ t go the first time because people I look up to told me , ‘ Don ’ t go. ’ They told me it would hurt my career and any aspirations that I had of my own . ”
Sam ultimately rejected that advice and participated in a White House panel with Jones , Kushner , Jessica Jackson and others , and shared her insights about prison reform .
“ For me , going into the Trump White House looked like the backyards of the families I lived next door to , ” said Sam , who grew up in the only black family in a suburban Long Island neighborhood . “ People might say , ‘ that ’ s not my president , ’ but the reality is Donald Trump is the president of the United States . ”
Jones “ understands that when you ’ re going against the grain , you ’ re going to get pushback , you ’ re going to get attacked , ” she said . “ It unfortunately is the way of the world . ”
NY1 anchor Errol Louis—who talked with Jones about his upbringing and religious traditions during the John Jay College event at which Jones was honored as a Justice Trailblazer—said his motivations are less complicated , and perhaps purer , than some would believe .
“ He ’ s a Bible-believing Christian , ” Louis told The ███ , citing Jones ’ speech in which he talked about his sheltered small-town childhood in Jackson , Tennessee , the son of educators ; he described himself as a bookish “ nerd ” who weighed 87 pounds and wore glasses ; his resolve to fight injustice , he told the audience , came from his experience of being bullied .
He never drank alcohol or did drugs , he said , and he was so shocked when he got to Yale and witnessed his law school classmates doing so much of both , among other things , that he phoned his grandmother—because he was too afraid to talk about it with his strict and straitlaced father—to ask what he should do about such rampant sinning .
Jones also noted the hypocrisy that allowed elite Yale students to engage in such activities with impunity , while Black kids in New Haven ’ s inner city were arrested and received harsh jail time for the same behavior .
Van Jones is not a journalist , he ’ s an activist and advocate . He made no secret of working with the Trump White House and members of Congress to pass the criminal justice and prison reform legislation known as “ The First Step Act . ”
“ The Messy Truth ” —to use the title of one of the CNN programs that Jones has hosted over the years—is that the cable outlet has repeatedly blurred the lines by placing him in journalistic roles , as when he grilled newsmakers and pop culture celebrities on The Van Jones Show , which ran every other Saturday night for 43 episodes on the cable outlet starting in January 2018 , or when he conducted a softball interview with Kushner at the CNN Citizen conference in October 2018 .
“ Van Jones was a tremendously important ally in getting the First Step Act over the finish line and signed into law , ” New York Democratic Rep. Hakeem Jeffries , a principal author of the law along with Georgia Republican Rep. Doug Collins , told The ███ . “ During the process of trying to move the bill forward in the House , there were some in the progressive community who strongly disagreed with the effort to find common ground with the Trump administration because of inherent distrust of the president . ”
Jeffries noted that he and Jones , among others—including such House Democrats as Reps. Karen Bass and Cedric Richmond— “ took a lot of criticism from some quarters on the left for being foolish enough to think that we could actually get something done . But we did . And at the end of the day , the legislation was supported by the ACLU and the Koch brothers , the NAACP and the Heritage Foundation . ”
Jeffries added : “ Van Jones worked the phones and talked to House Democrats . He ’ s particularly close to Keith Ellison and Tulsi Gabbard ” —the former Minneapolis congressman , now Minnesota ’ s attorney general , and the Hawaii congresswoman , respectively , who were both dubious of the effort . “ He talked to them and helped facilitate their support , which was incredibly important , ” Jeffries said .
Gabbard , who has become an especially close friend and sat for an interview on The Van Jones Show , told The ███ in a statement : “ Van is a deeply caring and compassionate person who is actually genuinely concerned about other people and the future of our country . He 's more concerned about helping people than the politics of who gets credit for helping them . ”
Kushner , for his part , said : “ We would not have been able to make this a bipartisan deal had it not been for Van . ”
“ I think [ Van ] is well-intentioned [ to work with Trump ] , but I think he totally underestimates the kind of guy he ’ s dealing with . ” — Rev . Al Sharpton to The ███
“ It was a step in the right direction , ” said Sharpton , who recalled , however , that when Jones encouraged him to attend the Oval Office signing ceremony , “ I said , ‘ I ’ m not going to the White House with Donald Trump , ’ and Van said , ‘ No , he won ’ t embarrass you , ’ and I said , ‘ Why put yourself in that position ? ’ ”
On Dec. 21 , 2018 , Jones stood behind the Resolute Desk , amid a crowd of Republican and Democratic lawmakers along with Kushner and Ivanka Trump , for the bill signing ceremony .
When the president called on him to speak , Jones delivered an impassioned sermon on the theme of freedom : “ In a country that is a democracy , we have the right to disagree….And where we disagree—on immigration , on climate change , on foreign policy—we should fight hard . But we have a responsibility—where we do agree—to work together hard…And when you ’ re trying to help people on the bottom , sir , I will work with or against any Democrat , with or against any Republican , because there is nothing more important than freedom . So thank you , sir . ”
Sharpton recalled : “ True to form , two or three weeks later , Trump attacked Van and me . That ’ s Trump . You can ’ t trust Trump . He ’ s a con man . I ’ m not giving a photo op to Trump , and I ’ m not going to take back that I think he ’ s a racist . ”
In a stream-of-consciousness October 2019 speech to a sympathetic audience at a White House summit for young Black leadership , Trump trashed Sharpton— “ Al ’ s a con man , we all know that…sort of a third-rate con guy ” —and complained at meandering length that Jones , while listing various people who had helped pass criminal justice reform , had failed to credit and thank him for signing the First Step Act 10 months earlier .
“ I kept waiting for my name , ” Trump told the group , adding that he called out to Melania as he watched Jones on TV , “ Darling come over here , I ’ m gon na have a great little name-mention…He didn ’ t name me ! I ’ m the one that did it ! I called up Jared—right , Jared ? —and said what the hell is this ? ”
Trump then recounted how Jones had called for his defeat in 2020 . “ And then he spoke to Jared and he apologized , didn ’ t he ? ” Trump claimed .
“ But I don ’ t accept those apologies , ” the president said . “ Van Jones ! He ’ s another beauty . ”
UPDATE : This story has been updated to include Jones ’ denial ; the phrase “ White House meetings ” has been replaced with “ discussions , ” to account for that denial . In addition , we have included further quotes on the role of Jones and his organization in the development of the police reform executive order , from the White House source with direct knowledge of the development of that document .","CNN star Van Jones has a habit of upsetting his fellow Black activists, progressive policy advocates, and liberal Democrats by cozying up to the Trump White House.

He did it again late last month, during the flap over a Black bird watcher in Central Park and a white Hillary Clinton voter who dialed 911 after refusing his pleas to leash her dog. Jones enraged Hillary loyalists—already exasperated by his willingness to concede her flaws as a 2016 presidential candidate in televised food nights with Trump acolyte Kayleigh McEnany—when he compared Clinton supporters unfavorably to the Klan.

“It’s not the racist white person who’s in the Ku Klux Klan that we have to worry about,” Jones said on CNN’s New Day. “It’s the white liberal Hillary Clinton supporter walking her dog in Central Park… But the minute she sees a Black man, who she does not respect, or has a slight thought against, she weaponized race like she had been trained by the Aryan Nation.”

More recently, on June 16, the 51-year-old Jones—a Yale Law School-trained attorney and former green energy jobs adviser in the Obama administration—provoked even more liberal distress and anger when he ladled praise on a so-called police reform initiative by President Donald Trump.

In this instance, however, he was slyly applauding himself.

Jones went on CNN’s Inside Politics with John King and Anderson Cooper 360 to enthusiastically commend Trump’s executive order—even as it was being criticized as cynical and unproductive by the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and “delusional” by the Color of Change, an influential racial justice organization that Jones himself co-founded in 2005.

CNN viewers weren’t informed that he had actually participated in secret discussions with his new friend Jared Kushner on ways to frame the presidential project.

“ In a tough situation Van has shown me that he’s got true character. He’s focused on the right things. ” — Jared Kushner to The Daily Beast

According to a knowledgeable White House source, who expressed satisfaction that there were zero leaks, Jones and California human rights attorney Jessica Jackson, who runs #cut50, a prison-reform group that Jones also founded, actively participated with law enforcement officials and White House staffers to help fashion the order and guide the politics of the discussion to what they considered “the sweet spot” between law enforcement and “the reasonable middle” and “the reasonable left.”

Skyping from his Los Angeles home, with a biography of Nelson Mandela and a Black Panther graphic novel visible on the bookshelf behind him, Jones told viewers of CNN’s noon show Inside Politics: “The executive order is a good thing, mainly because you saw the support of law enforcement there... There is movement in the direction of a database for bad cops. We have never had a federal database for bad cops, that’s why all these cops go all over the place doing bad stuff… The chokeholds, that’s common ground now between Nancy Pelosi and Trump. Good stuff there.”

Hours later, Jones doubled down on Anderson Cooper 360—again without disclosing his role advising the Trump White House. “What do you make of this executive order?” Cooper asked him.

“I think it’s pushing in the right direction,” Jones told the CNN anchor. “What you got today is, I think, a sign that we are winning,” he added. “Donald Trump has put himself on record saying we need to reform the police department… We are winning! Donald Trump had no plan a month ago to work on this issue at all. The fact that we are now in the direction of moving forward, I think, is good.”

After the publication of this story, Jones denied that he was involved in crafting the police reform order, tweeting: “I have never been included in any meetings about police reform (not by phone, zoom, nada). I didn’t know what was in the EO until the day it was released.”

Jones additionally claimed the article was “false” because he hasn’t been to D.C. since before the coronavirus pandemic. “The accusation that I attended White House meetings on police reform but failed to disclose them is doubly false, and it should be corrected,” he wrote.

But the White House source with knowledge said that “just recently, on the police reform executive order, Van and Jessica and the Reform Alliance, had been working with a lot of the families of people who had been killed by police officers, and we worked very closely with them on the EO.”

The source added: “On the EO, I would say he and Jessica were very helpful.”

“Van worked with us on fashioning things,” the source continued. “Having Van’s and Jessica’s perspective, they knew where the crazy people on the left were, they knew where the reasonable people on the left were, and everywhere in between. And they were helpful in guiding us to a sweet spot where we were able to speak with law enforcement but also do something that a lot of reasonable people in the middle and the reasonable left thought was a major step forward.”

During a Rose Garden ceremony that was actually a Trump campaign event—at which the president defended the police, touted his commitment to “law and order,” boasted about the stock market and the pre-coronavirus economy, and attacked Joe Biden—Trump was flanked by uniformed officers and police union officials as he signed the executive order in response to the pandemic of unjustified killings of unarmed Black Americans by white cops.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was quick to call the event “a photo op” and the executive order “seriously short of what is required”; Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer panned it as “weak tea” and the Rev. Al Sharpton—a longtime ally of Jones going back to the 1990s, when Jones was a self-avowed “radical” and social justice activist in Oakland—derided it as “toothless and meaningless” because it gives lip service, but no legal mandate, to banning chokeholds (unless officers decide their lives are at risk), improving police training, making use of mental health professionals, and keeping a national registry of bad cops.

“I did not think the executive order was worth the paper it was written on,” Sharpton told The Daily Beast. “Van’s experiment with Trump is a case of him having more faith than I have, but I’m not going to attack him for doing it…I think he’s well-intentioned, but I think he totally underestimates the kind of guy he’s dealing with. I just disagree that the people he’s dealing with have a sincere bone in their body. But I can’t fault him for trying.”

Among Jones’ many critics on the left, actor Jeffrey Wright was at once harsh and perceptive as he watched Jones compliment Trump’s policing initiative: “Smells like Van Jones helped Kushner craft this exec order, so he touts it. ‘You can't polish this turd,’ he said of Trump’s delinquency, yet here he is with boot black & rag,” Wright tweeted.

“Jones’ job appears to be making Republican policy palatable to black people. So expect him to call this new proposal progress,” wrote Jones detractor Stephen A. Crockett Jr., a columnist for The Root. Quoting Malcom X, Crockett added sarcastically: “‘Hey look, the knife went from being 9 inches in your back to being only 6 inches in your back,’ (Van Jones’ voice).”

Neither Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, nor Rashad Robinson, executive director of Color of Change, responded to interview requests. Jones, meanwhile, declined to speak to The Daily Beast before publication of this story. A member of his public relations staff explained that “due to his contractual obligations with CNN/Turner, he’s limited in what press he can do outside of their network.”

By one knowledgeable account, it was CNN’s politics czar, Sam Feist, the network’s Washington bureau chief and senior vice president, who introduced Kushner to Jones; at the time Jones was oscillating between making positive noises about Trump, who happens to be Kushner’s father-in-law, and trashing the new president.

“Donald Trump is a horrific jackass,” Jones said during a February 2017 speech at John Jay College’s Center on Media, Crime and Justice. “He’s one of the worst people ever born. He is.

“He became president of the United States in that moment. Period,” Jones claimed. “[T]hat was one of the most extraordinary moments you have ever seen in American politics.

Feist recommended that he speak to Jones, telling Kushner that the CNN personality was passionate about the issue.

“He was someone I’d seen on television, so I was deeply skeptical,” Kushner told The Daily Beast. “But I said I’d be happy to speak to him, and we had a good chat.

For the past three years, Jones’s media career has been managed by the Jay-Z-founded entertainment company, Roc Nation LLC. Apparently he has been doing well enough financially with all his entrepreneurial enterprises to give up his salary as president of Dream Corps, which paid him $209,469 in 2016, $145,541 in 2017 and nothing in 2018, according to the tax-exempt nonprofit’s public financial information.

Deese, these days a managing director and global head of sustainable investing for the asset-management behemoth BlackRock, didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Ironically, Jones has enjoyed far greater access to Donald Trump and his most powerful adviser, Jared Kushner, than he ever did to Barack Obama and Obama’s top aides.

“He goes places where others fear to go, and he is crucified in many ways for the decisions that he makes, but understands that this work is the work of our Creator,” said prison reform activist Topeka Sam, who met Jones at a Google event and began to work with him in 2016 after serving three years of a 10-year sentence on a federal non-violent drug conspiracy conviction. “We have to work with each other in order to get things changed, and have a better and just society.”

Yet Sam, too, initially resisted Jones’s invitation to join him in meetings at the Trump White House: “When Van invited me to the White House, I did not go the first time because people said don’t go, you don’t work with this administration, and nothing’s going to come of it…I didn’t go the first time because people I look up to told me, ‘Don’t go.’ They told me it would hurt my career and any aspirations that I had of my own.”

Sam ultimately rejected that advice and participated in a White House panel with Jones, Kushner, Jessica Jackson and others, and shared her insights about prison reform.

“For me, going into the Trump White House looked like the backyards of the families I lived next door to,” said Sam, who grew up in the only black family in a suburban Long Island neighborhood. “People might say, ‘that’s not my president,’ but the reality is Donald Trump is the president of the United States.”

Jones “understands that when you’re going against the grain, you’re going to get pushback, you’re going to get attacked,” she said. “It unfortunately is the way of the world.”

NY1 anchor Errol Louis—who talked with Jones about his upbringing and religious traditions during the John Jay College event at which Jones was honored as a Justice Trailblazer—said his motivations are less complicated, and perhaps purer, than some would believe.

“He’s a Bible-believing Christian,” Louis told The Daily Beast, citing Jones’ speech in which he talked about his sheltered small-town childhood in Jackson, Tennessee, the son of educators; he described himself as a bookish “nerd” who weighed 87 pounds and wore glasses; his resolve to fight injustice, he told the audience, came from his experience of being bullied.

He never drank alcohol or did drugs, he said, and he was so shocked when he got to Yale and witnessed his law school classmates doing so much of both, among other things, that he phoned his grandmother—because he was too afraid to talk about it with his strict and straitlaced father—to ask what he should do about such rampant sinning.

She said “pray,” Jones recounted.

Jones also noted the hypocrisy that allowed elite Yale students to engage in such activities with impunity, while Black kids in New Haven’s inner city were arrested and received harsh jail time for the same behavior.

Van Jones is not a journalist, he’s an activist and advocate. He made no secret of working with the Trump White House and members of Congress to pass the criminal justice and prison reform legislation known as “The First Step Act.”

“The Messy Truth”—to use the title of one of the CNN programs that Jones has hosted over the years—is that the cable outlet has repeatedly blurred the lines by placing him in journalistic roles, as when he grilled newsmakers and pop culture celebrities on The Van Jones Show, which ran every other Saturday night for 43 episodes on the cable outlet starting in January 2018, or when he conducted a softball interview with Kushner at the CNN Citizen conference in October 2018.

“Van Jones was a tremendously important ally in getting the First Step Act over the finish line and signed into law,” New York Democratic Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, a principal author of the law along with Georgia Republican Rep. Doug Collins, told The Daily Beast. “During the process of trying to move the bill forward in the House, there were some in the progressive community who strongly disagreed with the effort to find common ground with the Trump administration because of inherent distrust of the president.”

Jeffries noted that he and Jones, among others—including such House Democrats as Reps. Karen Bass and Cedric Richmond—“took a lot of criticism from some quarters on the left for being foolish enough to think that we could actually get something done. But we did. And at the end of the day, the legislation was supported by the ACLU and the Koch brothers, the NAACP and the Heritage Foundation.”

Jeffries added: “Van Jones worked the phones and talked to House Democrats. He’s particularly close to Keith Ellison and Tulsi Gabbard”—the former Minneapolis congressman, now Minnesota’s attorney general, and the Hawaii congresswoman, respectively, who were both dubious of the effort. “He talked to them and helped facilitate their support, which was incredibly important,” Jeffries said.

Gabbard, who has become an especially close friend and sat for an interview on The Van Jones Show, told The Daily Beast in a statement: “Van is a deeply caring and compassionate person who is actually genuinely concerned about other people and the future of our country. He's more concerned about helping people than the politics of who gets credit for helping them.”

Kushner, for his part, said: “We would not have been able to make this a bipartisan deal had it not been for Van.”

“ I think [Van] is well-intentioned [to work with Trump], but I think he totally underestimates the kind of guy he’s dealing with. ” — Rev. Al Sharpton to The Daily Beast

“It was a step in the right direction,” said Sharpton, who recalled, however, that when Jones encouraged him to attend the Oval Office signing ceremony, “I said, ‘I’m not going to the White House with Donald Trump,’ and Van said, ‘No, he won’t embarrass you,’ and I said, ‘Why put yourself in that position?’”

On Dec. 21, 2018, Jones stood behind the Resolute Desk, amid a crowd of Republican and Democratic lawmakers along with Kushner and Ivanka Trump, for the bill signing ceremony.

When the president called on him to speak, Jones delivered an impassioned sermon on the theme of freedom: “In a country that is a democracy, we have the right to disagree….And where we disagree—on immigration, on climate change, on foreign policy—we should fight hard. But we have a responsibility—where we do agree—to work together hard…And when you’re trying to help people on the bottom, sir, I will work with or against any Democrat, with or against any Republican, because there is nothing more important than freedom. So thank you, sir.”

Sharpton recalled: “True to form, two or three weeks later, Trump attacked Van and me. That’s Trump. You can’t trust Trump. He’s a con man. I’m not giving a photo op to Trump, and I’m not going to take back that I think he’s a racist.”

In a stream-of-consciousness October 2019 speech to a sympathetic audience at a White House summit for young Black leadership, Trump trashed Sharpton—“Al’s a con man, we all know that…sort of a third-rate con guy”—and complained at meandering length that Jones, while listing various people who had helped pass criminal justice reform, had failed to credit and thank him for signing the First Step Act 10 months earlier.

“I kept waiting for my name,” Trump told the group, adding that he called out to Melania as he watched Jones on TV, “Darling come over here, I’m gonna have a great little name-mention…He didn’t name me! I’m the one that did it! I called up Jared—right, Jared?—and said what the hell is this?”

Trump then recounted how Jones had called for his defeat in 2020. “And then he spoke to Jared and he apologized, didn’t he?” Trump claimed.

“But I don’t accept those apologies,” the president said. “Van Jones! He’s another beauty.”

UPDATE: This story has been updated to include Jones’ denial; the phrase “White House meetings” has been replaced with “discussions,” to account for that denial. In addition, we have included further quotes on the role of Jones and his organization in the development of the police reform executive order, from the White House source with direct knowledge of the development of that document.",www.thedailybeast.com,left,i3DXMqxnS6fx6KUs

Deadlock over immigration has meant that , for decades , politicians have turned to the same compromise : greater enforcement of immigration laws in exchange for more liberal policies .

media_bias,New Republic,0,https://newrepublic.com/article/155357/joe-biden-right-new-york-times,Joe Biden Is Right About The New York Times,2019-10-13,Osita Nwanevu,"There ’ s no clear way out of this dynamic and it ’ s not obvious that it ’ s fully a problem . We value journalism , in part , because we hope , perhaps naively , that the material journalists put into the world can guide decision-making . But the conventions of the contemporary press hold that some sorting of that material is necessary for the public ’ s sake—clear facts must be separated from disputable non-facts , especially politically charged opinions . The major papers have been particularly scrupulous about this distinction on certain matters—respected voices in the newspaper world routinely urge caution about describing clear patterns of misinformation from politicians as “ lies. ” The Trump era has seen papers like the Times deploy a variety of euphemisms for the word “ racist . ”
This caution lapses considerably for other material , including predictions and assessments of political viability . A Times article last week—news , not opinion—about how the Ukraine controversy may impact Joe Biden ’ s current standing in the Democratic primary contains this paragraph :
Now Mr. Biden looks more vulnerable than at any point since he entered the campaign . Facing one of the greatest challenges of his candidacy , Mr. Biden has plainly struggled to meet the moment , or fully reconcile his own cautious instincts with his protectiveness of his family ’ s privacy and his preference for taking the moral high road against Mr. Trump .
The fact that there may well be good reasons to believe any or all of these assertions about the Biden campaign does not change the fact that these are , clearly , opinions . On Friday , the Times published another piece about Biden that referred to him as a “ wounded leading candidate ” —accompanied by a graph that showed Biden not only rising a bit in the national polling average but still ahead of his standing after a deeper dip in the polls , four months ago , than his recent slide .
Contestable claims about political candidates and speculation about elections obviously have a place in our discourse . They are well within the purview of opinion journalism , which this magazine produces . But the major media outlets—particularly the major papers—often proudly claim they are devoted mostly to a different , nobler project : delivering the news free from both the spin of professional hacks as well as the slanted takes of pundits and partisan analysts , who are penned away in opinion sections .
But the walls the press has erected between what gets called news and the often speculative stuff of opinion have proven to be porous—a large share of campaign coverage , even at the major newspapers , seems to occupy a liminal space between between just-the-facts reporting and punditry . The latter , which we might call “ repunditry ” for the lack of a better term , is nevertheless routinely packaged as , or embedded within , the former .
Some of this slippage arises from a tension identified by Walter Lippmann , a founder of this magazine , in his 1922 book Public Opinion . There is a difference , he argued , between what we commonly recognize as “ news ” and what we understand to be “ truth . ”
The function of news is to signalize an event , the function of truth is to bring to light the hidden facts , to set them into relation with each other , and make a picture of reality on which men can act . Only at those points , where social conditions take recognizable and measurable shape , do the body of truth and the body of news coincide .
While we ’ re informed about particular events and particular realities when we read the news , Lippman explained , that granular material in and of itself , absent context and interpretation , doesn ’ t amount to a complete picture of reality . Our sense of the world around us depends on a weaving together of disparate facts . That weaving , Lippmann argued , is an inherently subjective process . “ The story of why John Smith failed , his human frailties , the analysis of the economic conditions on which he was shipwrecked—all of this can be told in a hundred different ways , ” he wrote .
These slips in and out of subjectivity—the subtle , barely there bits of speculation—this is repunditry .
This is less of a conundrum for opinion-based outlets than it is for institutions that purport to pin down and present to the public a clean , unslanted version of the truth—as amorphous and complicated as it is—through granular news coverage of events . This is an impossibility for Lippmann . The truth can not be reduced to a particular set of hard , indisputable facts about particular events that might be reported as news . “ Unless the event is capable of being named , measured , given shape , made specific , ” he wrote , “ it either fails to take on the character of news , or it is subject to the accidents and prejudices of observation. ” But we expect truth from the straight press anyway , encouraging straight political reporters to provide inevitably subjective context . These slips in and out of subjectivity—the subtle , barely there bits of speculation—this is repunditry .
Lippmann ’ s skepticism of the straight press ’ ability to fulfill its designated role as society ’ s source of reliably unbiased information deepened his skepticism of democracy—or at least democracy as we know it . Those of us more committed to the democratic project should think deeply about how well the major press is serving it , and whether media outlets , in their mission to inform the public , are doing enough to tell the public what , exactly , they are consuming when they consume the news . Clarity on the part of straight news outlets in the habit of repunditry could come either from a more direct embrace of subjectivity or a more thorough commitment to straightness : campaign reporting that simply tells readers what can indisputably be said about who candidates are , what they have done , and what they intend to do . In particular , outlets should reconsider whether guessing aloud to voters how voters might vote is the most unique and valuable service they can provide to the public . Many of the major outlets , in polling partnerships , already make representative data on public opinion readily available .

We value journalism, in part, because we hope, perhaps naively, that the material journalists put into the world can guide decision-making. But the conventions of the contemporary press hold that some sorting of that material is necessary for the public’s sake—clear facts must be separated from disputable non-facts, especially politically charged opinions. The major papers have been particularly scrupulous about this distinction on certain matters—respected voices in the newspaper world routinely urge caution about describing clear patterns of misinformation from politicians as “lies.” The Trump era has seen papers like the Times deploy a variety of euphemisms for the word “racist.”



This caution lapses considerably for other material, including predictions and assessments of political viability. A Times article last week—news, not opinion—about how the Ukraine controversy may impact Joe Biden’s current standing in the Democratic primary contains this paragraph:



Now Mr. Biden looks more vulnerable than at any point since he entered the campaign. Facing one of the greatest challenges of his candidacy, Mr. Biden has plainly struggled to meet the moment, or fully reconcile his own cautious instincts with his protectiveness of his family’s privacy and his preference for taking the moral high road against Mr. Trump.

The fact that there may well be good reasons to believe any or all of these assertions about the Biden campaign does not change the fact that these are, clearly, opinions. On Friday, the Times published another piece about Biden that referred to him as a “wounded leading candidate”—accompanied by a graph that showed Biden not only rising a bit in the national polling average but still ahead of his standing after a deeper dip in the polls, four months ago, than his recent slide.



Contestable claims about political candidates and speculation about elections obviously have a place in our discourse. They are well within the purview of opinion journalism, which this magazine produces. But the major media outlets—particularly the major papers—often proudly claim they are devoted mostly to a different, nobler project: delivering the news free from both the spin of professional hacks as well as the slanted takes of pundits and partisan analysts, who are penned away in opinion sections.



But the walls the press has erected between what gets called news and the often speculative stuff of opinion have proven to be porous—a large share of campaign coverage, even at the major newspapers, seems to occupy a liminal space between between just-the-facts reporting and punditry. The latter, which we might call “repunditry” for the lack of a better term, is nevertheless routinely packaged as, or embedded within, the former.

Some of this slippage arises from a tension identified by Walter Lippmann, a founder of this magazine, in his 1922 book Public Opinion. There is a difference, he argued, between what we commonly recognize as “news” and what we understand to be “truth.”



The function of news is to signalize an event, the function of truth is to bring to light the hidden facts, to set them into relation with each other, and make a picture of reality on which men can act. Only at those points, where social conditions take recognizable and measurable shape, do the body of truth and the body of news coincide.

While we’re informed about particular events and particular realities when we read the news, Lippman explained, that granular material in and of itself, absent context and interpretation, doesn’t amount to a complete picture of reality. Our sense of the world around us depends on a weaving together of disparate facts. That weaving, Lippmann argued, is an inherently subjective process. “The story of why John Smith failed, his human frailties, the analysis of the economic conditions on which he was shipwrecked—all of this can be told in a hundred different ways,” he wrote.



These slips in and out of subjectivity—the subtle, barely there bits of speculation—this is repunditry.

This is less of a conundrum for opinion-based outlets than it is for institutions that purport to pin down and present to the public a clean, unslanted version of the truth—as amorphous and complicated as it is—through granular news coverage of events. This is an impossibility for Lippmann. The truth cannot be reduced to a particular set of hard, indisputable facts about particular events that might be reported as news. “Unless the event is capable of being named, measured, given shape, made specific,” he wrote, “it either fails to take on the character of news, or it is subject to the accidents and prejudices of observation.” But we expect truth from the straight press anyway, encouraging straight political reporters to provide inevitably subjective context. These slips in and out of subjectivity—the subtle, barely there bits of speculation—this is repunditry.



Lippmann’s skepticism of the straight press’ ability to fulfill its designated role as society’s source of reliably unbiased information deepened his skepticism of democracy—or at least democracy as we know it. Those of us more committed to the democratic project should think deeply about how well the major press is serving it, and whether media outlets, in their mission to inform the public, are doing enough to tell the public what, exactly, they are consuming when they consume the news. Clarity on the part of straight news outlets in the habit of repunditry could come either from a more direct embrace of subjectivity or a more thorough commitment to straightness: campaign reporting that simply tells readers what can indisputably be said about who candidates are, what they have done, and what they intend to do. In particular, outlets should reconsider whether guessing aloud to voters how voters might vote is the most unique and valuable service they can provide to the public. Many of the major outlets, in polling partnerships, already make representative data on public opinion readily available. This is a more reliable source of information than trends extrapolated from anecdotes in diners or at campaign stops, and anyone who wants these numbers explained and contextualized can turn to a variety of professional forecasters.



The outcome of the 2020 Democratic primary will be revealed soon enough. In the meanwhile, campaign season resources should be reinvested in coverage of what our elections are ultimately for: questions of public policy. We should be hearing more about the issues, not just where the candidates stand on them, but where other people who have given thought to them—academics and researchers, activists, and, of course, the people most impacted—stand. What we lose in dubious claims about what may or may not “play” with voters, we might gain in a greater understanding of the matters that make politics important.

Shrieking ‘fascist!’ at every Trump tweet only makes reporters look lazy. To hold him accountable, they need facts and arguments.

If you believe the reports, President Donald Trump and his administration have spent the last month waging a brutal “war on the First Amendment” by ceaselessly lambasting the media without cause. But as usual, the media’s flair for the dramatic overstates the scale of the threat. Though Trump’s rhetorical attacks are unproductive and unnecessary, to suggest that he is a practical danger to the freedom of the press misunderstands the nature of the American media’s responsibility as a check on government power.

There is some merit to the contention that Trump has continuously behaved in an unpresidential fashion toward the media; the president shouldn’t routinely make the press a punching bag or refer to “the fake news media” as the “enemy of the American people.” For White House press secretary Sean Spicer to forbid particular outlets — those that have been especially critical of Trump — from entering a press gaggle in his office last week was both politically foolish and morally wrong, even though the press pool attended and full audio of the event was made available to reporters. What’s more, the Trump administration’s repeated critiques of particular outlets or stories often appear to be motivated by a distaste for certain depictions of the president or his policies rather than by substantive, factual disputes.

Nevertheless, there is a material difference between the uncouth and the unconstitutional, and the escalating “war on the media” rhetoric — expressed most recently at Vox and The Atlantic and, of course, in the consistent griping of journalists on Twitter — is a classic example of the press’s turning a sideshow into the headline attraction.

He'd call his site 'Pravda',2018-05-23,Seth Fiegerman,"Elon Musk , a frequent media darling , is going on the attack against the media .
Musk , the CEO of Tesla ( TSLA ) and SpaceX , accused the media of being dishonest and floated the possibility of building a service to rate the credibility of specific journalists and news outlets , in a series of tweets on Wednesday .
`` Going to create a site where the public can rate the core truth of any article & track the credibility score over time of each journalist , editor & publication , '' Musk tweeted .
He said the service could be called Pravda , which is Russian for `` truth '' and also happens to be the name of the newspaper central to the Soviet Union 's Communist Party .
A California business called Pravda Corp was incorporated late last year , with Jared Birchall listed in a filing as its president . Birchall 's name has also been listed in filings for other Musk projects , including The Boring Company .
In response to a tweet noting the Pravda Corp filing , Musk simply offered a hugging face emoji .
Representatives for Tesla and SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
Musk 's idea quickly raised concerns that the reputation of news organizations and reporters could be determined by what could be an easy to manipulate online popular vote .
`` Elon 's next company : Rate My Professor but for Journalists . What a great idea that wo n't be gamed immediately in extremely predictable ways , '' Rene DiResta , who researches computation propaganda and is a policy lead at Data For Democracy , wrote on Twitter .
Siva Vaidhyanathan , a media studies professor at the University of Virginia , told CNN such a service might might make sense if it employed a careful methodology and was overseen by an independent journalism foundation .
`` It 's not a crackpot idea , '' he said . `` The question is why should Elon Musk be the one running it and how trustworthy would it be if he ran it . ''
Musk 's media ruminations come after critical coverage of Tesla for missing Model 3 production goals , losing top executives and clashing with the government over an autopilot crash investigation .
Earlier this week , Musk pushed back against Reveal , a nonprofit news organization that published an investigative report raising concerns about safety conditions at Tesla factories .
Musk kicked off his tirade Wednesday in response to an analyst report noting that `` negative headlines '' about Tesla `` have increased substantially in the past month . ''
`` The holier-than-thou hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the truth , but publish only enough to sugarcoat the lie , is why the public no longer respects them , '' Musk wrote .
After one Twitter user raised concerns about Musk fanning distrust of the media , the CEO replied : `` The media has earned this mistrust . ''
`` The last thing we need is another rich and powerful dude threatening to silence any journalist who does n't see things his way , '' Timothy Karr , senior director of strategy at advocacy group Free Press , told CNN . `` The implication in Musk 's actions are that all news media are untrustworthy . That 's a shameful message to be spreading . ''
It 's just the latest outburst from Musk . On a recent earnings call , he interrupted analysts who asked about capital expenditures and production of Tesla 's first mass market car , the Model 3 .
`` Boring , bonehead questions are not cool , '' Musk said to one . `` These questions are so dry . They 're killing me , '' he said to another .","Elon Musk, a frequent media darling, is going on the attack against the media.

A California business called Pravda Corp was incorporated late last year, with Jared Birchall listed in a filing as its president. Birchall's name has also been listed in filings for other Musk projects, including The Boring Company.

In response to a tweet noting the Pravda Corp filing, Musk simply offered a hugging face emoji.

Representatives for Tesla and SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Musk's idea quickly raised concerns that the reputation of news organizations and reporters could be determined by what could be an easy to manipulate online popular vote.

""Elon's next company: Rate My Professor but for Journalists. What a great idea that won't be gamed immediately in extremely predictable ways,"" Rene DiResta, who researches computation propaganda and is a policy lead at Data For Democracy, wrote on Twitter.

Siva Vaidhyanathan, a media studies professor at the University of Virginia, told CNN such a service might might make sense if it employed a careful methodology and was overseen by an independent journalism foundation.

""It's not a crackpot idea,"" he said. ""The question is why should Elon Musk be the one running it and how trustworthy would it be if he ran it.""

Musk's media ruminations come after critical coverage of Tesla for missing Model 3 production goals, losing top executives and clashing with the government over an autopilot crash investigation.

Earlier this week, Musk pushed back against Reveal, a nonprofit news organization that published an investigative report raising concerns about safety conditions at Tesla factories.

Musk kicked off his tirade Wednesday in response to an analyst report noting that ""negative headlines"" about Tesla ""have increased substantially in the past month.""

""The holier-than-thou hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the truth, but publish only enough to sugarcoat the lie, is why the public no longer respects them,"" Musk wrote.

After one Twitter user raised concerns about Musk fanning distrust of the media, the CEO replied: ""The media has earned this mistrust.""

""The last thing we need is another rich and powerful dude threatening to silence any journalist who doesn't see things his way,"" Timothy Karr, senior director of strategy at advocacy group Free Press, told CNN. ""The implication in Musk's actions are that all news media are untrustworthy. That's a shameful message to be spreading.""

It's just the latest outburst from Musk. On a recent earnings call, he interrupted analysts who asked about capital expenditures and production of Tesla's first mass market car, the Model 3.

""Boring, bonehead questions are not cool,"" Musk said to one. ""These questions are so dry. They're killing me,"" he said to another.",www.money.cnn.com,left,03EdIv9VezIrsWhp

media_bias,FiveThirtyEight,1,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-the-media-has-and-hasnt-covered-tara-reades-allegation-against-joe-biden/,How The Media Has — And Hasn’t — Covered Tara Reade’s Allegation,2020-05-05,"Nathaniel Rakich, Dhrumil Mehta","Rather than dominating the news cycle , former Senate staffer Tara Reade ’ s recent allegation that former Vice President Joe Biden sexually assaulted her has been slow to receive coverage in many outlets .
Reade first stepped forward in spring 2019 as one of several women who accused Biden of inappropriate touching , but it wasn ’ t until March 25 , 2020 , that Reade alleged Biden had sexually assaulted her while she was a staffer in his office in 1993 . In a podcast interview with left-leaning commentator Katie Halper , Reade accused Biden of pushing her against a wall , reaching under her skirt and penetrating her with his fingers . ( While some of Reade ’ s family and friends say Reade told them about the incident shortly thereafter , other Biden staffers at the time do not recall hearing about it , and Biden has denied that it ever took place . ) But the story wasn ’ t really featured in the mainstream media until after April 12 , when The New York Times published an in-depth investigation of Reade ’ s claims .
Of the three major cable news channels , Fox News has devoted the most attention to Reade so far . Through Friday , May 1 , Fox News mentioned Reade in 371 clips collected by the TV News Archive — 344 of them on or after April 24 . Many of these mentions were by the channel ’ s conservative commentators criticizing Democrats and the media for not giving Reade ’ s allegation more air time .
By contrast , CNN and MSNBC mostly covered the story with on-air interviews of reporters who had investigated the allegation — but these channels also covered Reade much less . Through May 1 , CNN had only mentioned Reade in 35 clips , the first of which aired on April 25 . And MSNBC barely mentioned her until last Friday , when Biden personally appeared on the network to deny Reade ’ s claims . ( According to what Reade has told The New York Times , neither CNN nor MSNBC has asked to interview her on air , though they have spoken to her off camera . )
But while cable news didn ’ t mention Reade at all when the sexual assault allegation was first revealed , online news outlets did . After the story broke on March 25 , conservative news organizations like The Blaze and the Daily Caller picked it up right away . But while right-leaning outlets covered the story most heavily , HuffPost , Vox and The Guardian also wrote about the allegations in March . The Guardian and Vox even noted then how the story wasn ’ t yet appearing in mainstream news outlets . Fox News , which hadn ’ t yet mentioned Reade on TV , also published an article online about the allegations on March 27 . Starting in April , mainstream media coverage of the allegation began to pick up , but the volume of coverage mentioning Reade has still increased the most in conservative-leaning online media , which sometimes published multiple articles a day on the story .
At first , though , the headlines about the allegation were similar regardless of the outlet ’ s ideological bent — compare Breitbart ’ s “ Joe Biden Faces New Sexual Assault Allegation from Former Staffer ” to HuffPost ’ s “ Joe Biden Accused Of Sexually Assaulting Senate Aide In 1993 , ” for example . But if you were looking for articles about the story ’ s day-to-day developments , such as the emergence of the “ Larry King Live ” clip , conservative outlets were generally the place to look ( although the King clip was originally reported by The Intercept , which is regarded as left-leaning ) . And after The New York Times ’ s investigation into Reade ’ s claims , many conservative outlets also criticized its handling of the story , which evolved into articles about the lack of mainstream media coverage of the allegation .
Once the Times published its investigation in mid-April , other mainstream news organizations began covering the story as well . Some , like Time and Reuters , devoted entire articles to the allegation , but for others , like The Atlantic and Politico , early mentions of Reade appeared in articles that did not focus on her . And others , like CNN and CBS News , mentioned Reade ’ s allegation not as a straightforward breaking news story but in the context of how other Democrats were reacting . In general , the mainstream media was less likely than conservative outlets to publish follow-up stories containing new developments in the allegation , although that began to change last week as some mainstream outlets joined conservative ones in questioning Biden ’ s silence on the allegation , which may have led to his appearance on MSNBC on Friday .
Of course , one thing this data can ’ t tell us is how much coverage the allegation should be receiving ; there is no “ correct ” answer . It could be , as some have argued , that mainstream media outlets have a liberal bias and are avoiding the story for that reason — or it could be that conservative media outlets are simply likelier to run with a story that makes a Democrat look bad . It ’ s also possible that mainstream outlets investigated the claims and felt that the supporting evidence they were able to find was not enough for them to publish the story .
It ’ s also difficult to compare coverage of these sexual assault allegations with coverage of the allegations made against President Trump , Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh or other politicians who have faced similar scandals . Any number of factors — such as the prominence of the person being accused , the seriousness of the allegations and the number of accusers — can influence the amount of media coverage a sexual assault allegation receives , and Biden ’ s situation is not necessarily a close match along all of these dimensions . ( Most obviously , the only other politician of similar prominence to face sexual assault allegations recently — Trump — faced several of them , and also was infamously caught on video bragging about his sexual pursuits . )
And perhaps the biggest confounder is the news environment in which this story has arisen . The coronavirus pandemic is currently sucking up so much of the media oxygen that it is unlikely that any political story would be covered as thoroughly as it would be in normal times . So while it seems clear that coverage of Reade ’ s allegation has so far been limited , it ’ s hard to pinpoint exactly why that is .","Rather than dominating the news cycle, former Senate staffer Tara Reade’s recent allegation that former Vice President Joe Biden sexually assaulted her has been slow to receive coverage in many outlets.

Reade first stepped forward in spring 2019 as one of several women who accused Biden of inappropriate touching, but it wasn’t until March 25, 2020, that Reade alleged Biden had sexually assaulted her while she was a staffer in his office in 1993. In a podcast interview with left-leaning commentator Katie Halper, Reade accused Biden of pushing her against a wall, reaching under her skirt and penetrating her with his fingers. (While some of Reade’s family and friends say Reade told them about the incident shortly thereafter, other Biden staffers at the time do not recall hearing about it, and Biden has denied that it ever took place.) But the story wasn’t really featured in the mainstream media until after April 12, when The New York Times published an in-depth investigation of Reade’s claims.

Since then, the accusation has gotten more attention, starting on April 24, when a “Larry King Live” clip from 1993 emerged in which a caller who may be Reade’s mother describes her daughter’s “problems” with a “prominent senator.” Coverage continued to climb after April 27, when Reade’s former neighbor said that Reade had told her details about the alleged assault in the mid-1990s, and May 1, when Biden himself made his first public comment on the allegation. Nevertheless, our analysis of closed captioning data for Fox News, MSNBC and CNN, pulled from the TV News Archive, and of online news articles from the Media Cloud database finds that the volume of coverage of the allegation remained low until very recently, and it has gotten more attention from right-leaning outlets, both on television and online.

Of the three major cable news channels, Fox News has devoted the most attention to Reade so far. Through Friday, May 1, Fox News mentioned Reade in 371 clips collected by the TV News Archive — 344 of them on or after April 24. Many of these mentions were by the channel’s conservative commentators criticizing Democrats and the media for not giving Reade’s allegation more air time.

By contrast, CNN and MSNBC mostly covered the story with on-air interviews of reporters who had investigated the allegation — but these channels also covered Reade much less. Through May 1, CNN had only mentioned Reade in 35 clips, the first of which aired on April 25. And MSNBC barely mentioned her until last Friday, when Biden personally appeared on the network to deny Reade’s claims. (According to what Reade has told The New York Times, neither CNN nor MSNBC has asked to interview her on air, though they have spoken to her off camera.)

But while cable news didn’t mention Reade at all when the sexual assault allegation was first revealed, online news outlets did. After the story broke on March 25, conservative news organizations like The Blaze and the Daily Caller picked it up right away. But while right-leaning outlets covered the story most heavily, HuffPost, Vox and The Guardian also wrote about the allegations in March. The Guardian and Vox even noted then how the story wasn’t yet appearing in mainstream news outlets. Fox News, which hadn’t yet mentioned Reade on TV, also published an article online about the allegations on March 27. Starting in April, mainstream media coverage of the allegation began to pick up, but the volume of coverage mentioning Reade has still increased the most in conservative-leaning online media, which sometimes published multiple articles a day on the story.

At first, though, the headlines about the allegation were similar regardless of the outlet’s ideological bent — compare Breitbart’s “Joe Biden Faces New Sexual Assault Allegation from Former Staffer” to HuffPost’s “Joe Biden Accused Of Sexually Assaulting Senate Aide In 1993,” for example. But if you were looking for articles about the story’s day-to-day developments, such as the emergence of the “Larry King Live” clip, conservative outlets were generally the place to look (although the King clip was originally reported by The Intercept, which is regarded as left-leaning). And after The New York Times’s investigation into Reade’s claims, many conservative outlets also criticized its handling of the story, which evolved into articles about the lack of mainstream media coverage of the allegation.

Once the Times published its investigation in mid-April, other mainstream news organizations began covering the story as well. Some, like Time and Reuters, devoted entire articles to the allegation, but for others, like The Atlantic and Politico, early mentions of Reade appeared in articles that did not focus on her. And others, like CNN and CBS News, mentioned Reade’s allegation not as a straightforward breaking news story but in the context of how other Democrats were reacting. In general, the mainstream media was less likely than conservative outlets to publish follow-up stories containing new developments in the allegation, although that began to change last week as some mainstream outlets joined conservative ones in questioning Biden’s silence on the allegation, which may have led to his appearance on MSNBC on Friday.

Of course, one thing this data can’t tell us is how much coverage the allegation should be receiving; there is no “correct” answer. It could be, as some have argued, that mainstream media outlets have a liberal bias and are avoiding the story for that reason — or it could be that conservative media outlets are simply likelier to run with a story that makes a Democrat look bad. It’s also possible that mainstream outlets investigated the claims and felt that the supporting evidence they were able to find was not enough for them to publish the story.

It’s also difficult to compare coverage of these sexual assault allegations with coverage of the allegations made against President Trump, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh or other politicians who have faced similar scandals. Any number of factors — such as the prominence of the person being accused, the seriousness of the allegations and the number of accusers — can influence the amount of media coverage a sexual assault allegation receives, and Biden’s situation is not necessarily a close match along all of these dimensions. (Most obviously, the only other politician of similar prominence to face sexual assault allegations recently — Trump — faced several of them, and also was infamously caught on video bragging about his sexual pursuits.)

And perhaps the biggest confounder is the news environment in which this story has arisen. The coronavirus pandemic is currently sucking up so much of the media oxygen that it is unlikely that any political story would be covered as thoroughly as it would be in normal times. So while it seems clear that coverage of Reade’s allegation has so far been limited, it’s hard to pinpoint exactly why that is.

Nick Sandmann was among a group of fellow students from Kentucky 's Covington Catholic High School attending the march on the National Mall , while Native American Nathan Phillips was also there for a separate rally for indigenous peoples .
One video of the encounter shows the students chanting and laughing as Phillips drummed in Sandmann 's face . The footage was shared on social media and went viral , claiming that the boys blocked the Native American so they could taunt him . Liberal media outlets like CNN picked up the story and ran with it , fueling the outrage from leftists who spewed hate against the boys , assuming they were racist because some of them were wearing `` Make America Great Again '' hats .
But longer videos of the encounter show the boys standing in that spot for a long period of time before Phillips walked up to them to play his drum right in the middle of their group .
`` The protester everyone has seen in the video began playing his drum as he waded into the crowd , which parted for him . I did not see anyone try to block his path , '' Sandmann said , contradicting the Native American elder 's claims that one of the students would n't let him move . `` He locked eyes with me and approached me , coming within inches of my face . He played his drum the entire time he was in my face . ''
The students were later condemned for their actions , but Sandmann , who was shown standing in front of Mr. Phillips smiling , says he was only trying to calm things down in the midst of the chaos . The teen explained that by `` remaining motionless and calm , '' he believed he was `` helping defuse the situation . ''
`` I said a silent prayer that the situation would not get out of hand , '' he wrote .
Likewise , Phillips says it was his intent as well to try to calm down things between conflicting groups .
`` They were making remarks to each other ... ( such as ) 'In my state those Indians are nothing but a bunch of drunks . ' How do I report that ? '' Phillips said of the students . `` These young people were just roughshodding through our space , like what 's been going on for 500 years here — just walking through our territories , feeling like 'this is ours . ' ''
But then on NPR Monday morning , Phillips said he had gone over to calm things down because a group of protesters , whom he compared to a black version of the racist group called the Westboro Baptists , was stoking confrontation .
And Sandmann denies the students made derogatory statements , suggesting it was members of that third group affiliated with the Black Hebrew Israelites that were fomenting unrest , allegedly yelling negative statements at both groups . He noted the Black Israelites called he and his fellow students `` racists , '' ″bigots , '' `` white crackers '' and `` incest kids . '' One video also shows them using the `` n '' word , telling an African-American boy who appeared to be with the school group that the white people were going to steal his organs .
Meanwhile , Sandmann responded to critics on social media who he says erroneously interpreted his actions as being racist .
`` I am being called every name in the book , including a racist , and I will not stand for this mob-like character assassination of my family 's name , '' he said .

Roger Ailes, the channel’s chairman and CEO, has a politician’s sense of his base — Fox viewers. He revolutionized television by tapping into Republican disgust and anger with the mainstream media. This has worked brilliantly for him. He created not only the most-watched cable news channel in the country — he created political celebrities, several of whom dominated Republican politics in the 2012 cycle.

At various points, many of those celebrities, all with Fox contracts, were at or near the top of Republican presidential polls: Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum, Palin and Mike Huckabee. But by the end of campaign, Fox could seem like an alternate universe, one in which the Benghazi killings were the most important story in America and Mitt Romney, contrary to public polls and Fox’s own polls, was on his way to winning the election. While ratings were strong, the network had a bumpy election night, capped off by Rove taking to its air to argue that everyone else was premature in calling Ohio for President Barack Obama. Rove, who recently had his Fox contract renewed, saw his appearances scaled back after the scene.

Or is this policy unique to the Trump Administration , as Democrats claim ?
There are three instances when children are separated from their family when caught illegally crossing the border ( as Rich Lowry helpfully explained in this piece ) : When the `` parent '' is n't actually the parent ; when the parent is deemed a threat to the child ( ren ) , and when the parent is put into a criminal proceeding .
What 's changed under the Trump Administration is that all adult illegal aliens apprehended at the border are now being prosecuted ; as a result , more children are being held as their parents await their proceedings . However , this process typically takes less than a day . They are then reunited and returned home .
More complicated is when the parents claim political asylum , a process that takes longer to adjudicate . During these proceedings , the government is forced to release either the children or the entire family after a period of 20 days , a loophole that has made the use of children in asylum claims increasingly frequent . As Lowry notes :
In that scenario , the adults are almost certainly going to be detained longer than the government is allowed to hold their children . That ’ s because of something called the Flores Consent Decree from 1997 . It says that unaccompanied children can be held only 20 days . A ruling by the Ninth Circuit extended this 20-day limit to children who come as part of family units . So even if we want to hold a family unit together , we are forbidden from doing so . The clock ticking on the time the government can hold a child will almost always run out before an asylum claim is settled . The migrant is allowed ten days to seek an attorney , and there may be continuances or other complications .
Because the feds are barred from holding children as long as asylum claims typically take to process , they are often forced to release either the children , or the whole family , into America . Unsurprisingly , it has become increasingly common for illegal immigrants to bring children specifically to increase their chances of successfully entering the States .
Lowry quotes New York Times and Arizona Republic reports where smugglers admit paying Central American parents to use their children for help secure entry to America . The Daily Caller 's Saagar Enjeti quoted a law enforcement source who said children are being used as part of `` rampant fraud '' to gain entry to the U.S. :
THREAD 1/ : LE source actively involved in situation at border tells @ DailyCaller single males with `` children '' are increasingly arriving . Neither the child nor the adult can answer basic questions about each other , authorities suspect rampant fraud https : //t.co/SHXEqzB0pS pic.twitter.com/2P7knSPDxc — Saagar Enjeti ( @ esaagar ) June 18 , 2018
2/ Source also told us many illegals are posing as citizens of non-contiguous countries to bolster false asylum claims and that all children have been coached w/ the exact same script . DHS officials confirmed to us that these practices are widespread . https : //t.co/SHXEqzB0pS pic.twitter.com/2qxsvqG4UT — Saagar Enjeti ( @ esaagar ) June 18 , 2018
As The Federalist 's John Daniel Davidson reports that under the previous system , migrants who brought children and are seeking asylum were released into the public .
2/ What few outlets are reporting is that prior to this family separation policy , families caught crossing illegally that tried to claim asylum were released within a few days . The parents were given ankle monitors and told to report to an asylum hearing months away . — John Daniel Davidson ( @ johnddavidson ) June 18 , 2018
`` Almost all these families would be headed for somewhere north of the border , as far north as New York and Pennsylvania , '' Davidson continued . `` When they got to where they were going , they 'd usually cut the ankle monitor off . Few would ever show up to the asylum hearing . ''
Davidson then makes the key point : `` What 's missing in the coverage so far is any kind of nuance or granularity about what the options are for families caught crossing illegally . Releasing them w/ankle monitors is a de facto open borders policy . Separating families is inhumane and cruel . Both are undesirable . ''
This issue , as you may be starting to notice , is much more complex than the media is letting on . Americans who rely on the mainstream media for their information are likely of the belief that it 's a Trump Administration policy to automatically separate children from their parents . Yet , that 's clearly not the case .
But rather than helping to educate voters on what 's really going on , the major media is doing its best to stoke hysteria . Here , without further ado , are the six worst examples :
6 . CNN contributor and former National Security Adviser Michael Hayden likens America 's border security policy to ... the holocaust . First , he did so in a tweet , then defended that tweet in an appearance on CNN , and then triple-downed on the comparison Monday night :
Hayden : `` I showed the picture in 1944 , but my story is Berlin 1933 . You had a new government in power with a cult of personality , a cult of nativism , a cult of untruth , a cult where it was acceptable to punish the marginalized segments of society . I ’ m not saying our needle is in the red . I ’ m not saying we ’ re becoming Nazis . What I was trying to say was the needle is moving in the wrong direction . The way I described it to myself before I hit send was , the skies are darkening . I want to send up a flare . ''
5 . The Washington Post 's Wesley Lowery likens America 's immigration policy to slavery :
LOWERY : “ When you look at this historically throughout American history , no matter of the policy you ’ re talking about , the separation of families has always been something that speaks to a level of inhumanity . You go back to slavery , and this is what the abolitionists were arguing for , and one of the reasons eventually that public opinion shifted was that one of the reasons this can not be just , is that we can ’ t justify splitting these families up in all of these different ways . And so when you look at our immigration policy and other groups of immigrants previously , as we grappled with centuries of immigration policy , the division and the splitting of our families has always been be a line that the public has not been comfortable with , no matter how potentially demagogued or stereotyped the group of immigrants may have been . ''
MAXWELL : “ Correct . It ’ s also their choice . This is intentional cruelty . Something they are doing deliberately . They are making a choice to separate babies from their mothers . They are doing that as an inhumane policies , because the people are brown . We also have to talk about the fact this is a racist policy . If these children were white , we would not be doing this . ”

When did this controversial policy begin?

Is this a Democratic law, as President Trump argued?

Or is this policy unique to the Trump Administration, as Democrats claim?

The answer is somewhere in the middle.

So, what's going on?

There are three instances when children are separated from their family when caught illegally crossing the border (as Rich Lowry helpfully explained in this piece): When the ""parent"" isn't actually the parent; when the parent is deemed a threat to the child(ren), and when the parent is put into a criminal proceeding.

What's changed under the Trump Administration is that all adult illegal aliens apprehended at the border are now being prosecuted; as a result, more children are being held as their parents await their proceedings. However, this process typically takes less than a day. They are then reunited and returned home.

More complicated is when the parents claim political asylum, a process that takes longer to adjudicate. During these proceedings, the government is forced to release either the children or the entire family after a period of 20 days, a loophole that has made the use of children in asylum claims increasingly frequent. As Lowry notes:

In that scenario, the adults are almost certainly going to be detained longer than the government is allowed to hold their children. That’s because of something called the Flores Consent Decree from 1997. It says that unaccompanied children can be held only 20 days. A ruling by the Ninth Circuit extended this 20-day limit to children who come as part of family units. So even if we want to hold a family unit together, we are forbidden from doing so. The clock ticking on the time the government can hold a child will almost always run out before an asylum claim is settled. The migrant is allowed ten days to seek an attorney, and there may be continuances or other complications.

Because the feds are barred from holding children as long as asylum claims typically take to process, they are often forced to release either the children, or the whole family, into America. Unsurprisingly, it has become increasingly common for illegal immigrants to bring children specifically to increase their chances of successfully entering the States.

Lowry quotes New York Times and Arizona Republic reports where smugglers admit paying Central American parents to use their children for help secure entry to America. The Daily Caller's Saagar Enjeti quoted a law enforcement source who said children are being used as part of ""rampant fraud"" to gain entry to the U.S.:

THREAD 1/: LE source actively involved in situation at border tells @DailyCaller single males with ""children"" are increasingly arriving. Neither the child nor the adult can answer basic questions about each other, authorities suspect rampant fraud https://t.co/SHXEqzB0pS pic.twitter.com/2P7knSPDxc — Saagar Enjeti (@esaagar) June 18, 2018

2/ Source also told us many illegals are posing as citizens of non-contiguous countries to bolster false asylum claims and that all children have been coached w/ the exact same script. DHS officials confirmed to us that these practices are widespread. https://t.co/SHXEqzB0pS pic.twitter.com/2qxsvqG4UT — Saagar Enjeti (@esaagar) June 18, 2018

As The Federalist's John Daniel Davidson reports that under the previous system, migrants who brought children and are seeking asylum were released into the public.

2/ What few outlets are reporting is that prior to this family separation policy, families caught crossing illegally that tried to claim asylum were released within a few days. The parents were given ankle monitors and told to report to an asylum hearing months away. — John Daniel Davidson (@johnddavidson) June 18, 2018

""Almost all these families would be headed for somewhere north of the border, as far north as New York and Pennsylvania,"" Davidson continued. ""When they got to where they were going, they'd usually cut the ankle monitor off. Few would ever show up to the asylum hearing.""

Davidson then makes the key point: ""What's missing in the coverage so far is any kind of nuance or granularity about what the options are for families caught crossing illegally. Releasing them w/ankle monitors is a de facto open borders policy. Separating families is inhumane and cruel. Both are undesirable.""

The Misleading Media

This issue, as you may be starting to notice, is much more complex than the media is letting on. Americans who rely on the mainstream media for their information are likely of the belief that it's a Trump Administration policy to automatically separate children from their parents. Yet, that's clearly not the case.

But rather than helping to educate voters on what's really going on, the major media is doing its best to stoke hysteria. Here, without further ado, are the six worst examples:

6. CNN contributor and former National Security Adviser Michael Hayden likens America's border security policy to ... the holocaust. First, he did so in a tweet, then defended that tweet in an appearance on CNN, and then triple-downed on the comparison Monday night:

Hayden: ""I showed the picture in 1944, but my story is Berlin 1933. You had a new government in power with a cult of personality, a cult of nativism, a cult of untruth, a cult where it was acceptable to punish the marginalized segments of society. I’m not saying our needle is in the red. I’m not saying we’re becoming Nazis. What I was trying to say was the needle is moving in the wrong direction. The way I described it to myself before I hit send was, the skies are darkening. I want to send up a flare.""

5. The Washington Post's Wesley Lowery likens America's immigration policy to slavery:

LOWERY: “When you look at this historically throughout American history, no matter of the policy you’re talking about, the separation of families has always been something that speaks to a level of inhumanity. You go back to slavery, and this is what the abolitionists were arguing for, and one of the reasons eventually that public opinion shifted was that one of the reasons this cannot be just, is that we can’t justify splitting these families up in all of these different ways. And so when you look at our immigration policy and other groups of immigrants previously, as we grappled with centuries of immigration policy, the division and the splitting of our families has always been be a line that the public has not been comfortable with, no matter how potentially demagogued or stereotyped the group of immigrants may have been.""

4. MSNBC contributor Zerlina Maxwell argued that if Central and South Americans were white, the Trump administration wouldn't be doing this. (Note: Per the U.S. government, Hispanics are considered white.)

MAXWELL: “Correct. It’s also their choice. This is intentional cruelty. Something they are doing deliberately. They are making a choice to separate babies from their mothers. They are doing that as an inhumane policies, because the people are brown. We also have to talk about the fact this is a racist policy. If these children were white, we would not be doing this.”

3. MSNBC's Mike Barnicle employed a now-familiar rhetorical device, claiming that the White House was taking children ""hostage"":

BARNICLE: “This is our story. The story of children being taken hostage on a hot Texas landscape, held in cages, away from their parents, being used as pawns to get money to build a wall, by a Republican Party whose policy is to separate them from their families, from their mothers and their fathers. That’s our story in America today. And it’s up to the people of America and the people who represent them in Congress to decide whether that’s the story they want to go with. And politically, Michael, I would estimate, think, guess, that it’s political malpractice. With a booming economy, with no matter what you think of what took place in Singapore, a president meeting with the North Korean dictator to resolve some nuclear issues and the threat of war, they’re not concentrating on that. They’re being branded now with these pictures that every American is seeing. The pictures now coming with a soundtrack of children crying and that’s what they’re defending rather than their record, which some people would approve of.”

2. CNBC's John Harwood said Republicans are simply interested in trying to prevent ""more non-white people"" from entering the country:

HARWOOD: ""We have a president who is not honest, who lacks a moral sense, who lacks empathy. And what he is trying to do is deflect blame for a policy that he has caused to happen.

At the height of his influence , Howard Kurtz was widely regarded as the most influential media reporter and critic in the country . But in recent years , erroneous reporting and careless errors reduced him to fodder for the media reporters and critics who followed in his footsteps .
No single event has dealt such a crushing blow to Kurtz ’ s reputation as Thursday ’ s decision to “ part ways ” — after a serious mistake in a story about gay basketball player Jason Collins — with The Daily Beast , where he has served as columnist and Washington bureau chief since leaving a long , illustrious career with The Washington Post in 2010 .

At the height of his influence, Howard Kurtz was widely regarded as the most influential media reporter and critic in the country. But in recent years, erroneous reporting and careless errors reduced him to fodder for the media reporters and critics who followed in his footsteps.

No single event has dealt such a crushing blow to Kurtz’s reputation as Thursday’s decision to “part ways” — after a serious mistake in a story about gay basketball player Jason Collins — with The Daily Beast, where he has served as columnist and Washington bureau chief since leaving a long, illustrious career with The Washington Post in 2010.

In the wake of that decision, CNN also announced that Kurtz’s longtime weekend media criticism show, “Reliable Sources,” was under review.

The takedown comes on the heels of a video , posted in the Infowars app last week and viewed by ███ , in which Jones disputed the need for social distancing , shelter in place , and quarantine efforts meant to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus .
Google confirmed to ███ that it removed the app on Friday . The app had more than 100,000 downloads according to Google Play 's published metrics , and was rated `` E10+ , '' meaning safe for all users 10 and older . The Infowars app sold products like supplements and protein powder , broadcast The Alex Jones Show live , and posted videos and articles from Jones and others .
`` Now more than ever , combating misinformation on the Play Store is a top priority for the team , '' a Google spokesperson told ███ . `` When we find apps that violate Play policy by distributing misleading or harmful information , we remove them from the store . ''
Alex Jones and Infowars did not immediately respond to a request for comment . In the video in question , Jones said that `` everybody dies under the new world order except maybe one tenth of one percent that believe they 're going to merge with machines and have made deals with this inter-dimensional thing that gave them all the technology ... You ca n't make a deal with these aliens , OK , that the Bible tells you about and ever get off the planet . '' Elsewhere in the video , Jones claims that natural antivirals exist to treat the novel coronavirus .
Google is far from the first tech giant to block or ban Infowars content . In fact , Google-owned YouTube suspended The Alex Jones Channel in August 2018 , after mounting pressure from critics that platforms should enforce their anti-hate speech policies .

In the wake of all the mainstream bans , Jones and his supporters have repeatedly maintained that blocking Infowars and Jones ' content only spreads it farther and makes it more popular . But research indicates that so-called `` deplatforming '' actions do effectively reduce the spread of hate speech , misinformation , and conspiracy theories . The bigger question is why Google waited so long to take action against Infowars given that its peer organizations did so a year and a half ago .
Tech services and social networks have long touted their role as defenders of free speech . But rampant abuse , misinformation , and coordinated disinformation campaigns carried out by nation states on the platforms have brought the industry to a new understanding in recent years of its necessary role in policing violent and dangerous content .

A joint statement from Facebook , Google , LinkedIn , Microsoft , Reddit , Twitter , and YouTube last week said that the companies are pledging to help `` millions of people stay connected while also jointly combating fraud and misinformation about the virus .

Jones has received other public pushback as well for his claims about the spread and treatment of Covid-19 .

The left hounded administration officials at restaurants and at home , which thrilled Univision anchor Jorge Ramos . Protestors confronted Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen while she was eating at a restaurant and at her home , while White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders was kicked out of a restaurant because she works for President Trump .
Far-left Splinter News tweeted out the personal cell phone number of White House senior adviser Stephen Miller , and a fading Hollywood star called for the president ’ s youngest son to be dragged from his mother and “ put in a cage with pedophiles . ”
That barely begins the hate-fest . Canadian comedy writer Pat Dussault apologized after tweeting what appeared to be a disturbing threat to Donald Trump Jr. ’ s 4-year-old daughter . “ Don ’ t worry , we ’ re coming for Chloe , too , ” he wrote .
Next , there was the widespread assault on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) . Former “ Sex and the City ” star Cynthia Nixon – now seeking the Democratic nomination for governor of New York against Gov . Andrew Cuomo – called the officers a “ terrorist organization . ”
The anti-American “ journalism ” group Wikileaks posted a database of ICE officers . Open borders extremist and Border Angels Founder Enrique Morones told “ The Beat With Ari Melber ” on MSNBC : “ Donald Trump , without a doubt , is pure evil . ”

The headline read : “ Welcome to America. ” The media went bonkers , with TV outlets pitching it as news .
Turns out the doctored image that merged Trump and the little girl as if they were standing together ( they weren ’ t ) was more than a little inaccurate . The girl was indeed separated from her mom – by about two feet .
Of course , the media loved the phony image . ABC , CBS , NBC , MSNBC and CNN all reported on it . “ CBS This Morning ” Co-host John Dickerson summed up the approval , referring to it as “ an iconic – a now-iconic photo taken last week captured that girl as her mother was detained . ”
It gets worse . The girl ’ s mother has been deported previously for illegal immigration . Time ’ s correction of the whole affair was laughably dishonest , admitting only that the “ story misstated what happened to the girl in the photo . ”

At least , this time it wasn ’ t ABC News Chief Investigative Correspondent Brian Ross tanking the entire stock market .
Washington Post Media Critic Eric Wemple crushed ABC in a story headlined : “ In colossal error , ABC News reports that Paul Manafort ‘ pleads guilty ’ to manslaughter. ” Wemple came up with three scenarios how it happened .

The headline read: “Welcome to America.” The media went bonkers, with TV outlets pitching it as news.

Only it wasn’t.

Turns out the doctored image that merged Trump and the little girl as if they were standing together (they weren’t) was more than a little inaccurate. The girl was indeed separated from her mom – by about two feet.

Of course, the media loved the phony image. ABC, CBS, NBC, MSNBC and CNN all reported on it. “CBS This Morning” Co-host John Dickerson summed up the approval, referring to it as “an iconic – a now-iconic photo taken last week captured that girl as her mother was detained.”

The brain trust at error-prone ABC (admittedly, not brainy or trustworthy) was quick to release an apology. “There simply is no excuse for this sort of mistake,” it wrote saying network officials “are investigating” how it happened. At least, this time it wasn’t ABC News Chief Investigative Correspondent Brian Ross tanking the entire stock market.

Washington Post Media Critic Eric Wemple crushed ABC in a story headlined: “In colossal error, ABC News reports that Paul Manafort ‘pleads guilty’ to manslaughter.” Wemple came up with three scenarios how it happened. The first two ended by calling it “a clear scandal with disciplinary implications.” The third version added “or perhaps law-enforcement implications.”

Newswatch is seen weekdays on the ███ News Channel .
After finding 40 churches connected to around 650 cases of the coronavirus , The New York Times is calling Sunday worship services “ a major source ” of COVID-19 cases .
“ The virus has infiltrated Sunday sermons , meetings of ministers and Christian youth camps in Colorado and Missouri , ” reads the Times piece . “ It has struck churches that reopened cautiously with face masks and social distancing in the pews , as well as some that defied lockdowns and refused to heed new limits on numbers of worshipers . ”
The story does , of course , link to legitimate cases — like Calvary Chapel in San Antonio , where around 50 congregants and staffers have come down with mild coronavirus infections , and Kanakuk Kamps in Missouri , which has been hit with more than 80 cases of COVID-19 . The most heartbreaking case included in the Times article is that of Carsyn Davis , a Fort Myers , Florida , high schooler who , suffering from asthma and a rare neurological disorder , passed away after being infected with the coronavirus . The authors of the piece , though , then extrapolate that those anecdotal instances are proof churches are spreading the virus nationwide in disproportionate numbers .
Hershael York , dean of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary ’ s School of Theology and pastor of Buck Run Baptist Church in Frankfort , Kentucky , asked , “ How many 1000s of churches are meeting now ?

The piece from the Times comes not long after California Gov . Gavin Newsom ( D ) signed an executive order prohibiting singing in churches , as doing so could exponentially spread the virus , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Newsom ’ s order decrees churches “ must therefore discontinue singing and chanting activities and limit indoor attendance to 25 % of building capacity or a maximum of 100 attendees , whichever is lower . ”

The CDC initially issued a warning against singing in March , but deleted the directive in May after facing criticism .

“ How can you permit , not for one day , but for many days , tens of thousands to march in protest without wearing masks and then demand that 100 worshipers refrain from singing ? ” asked Rodriguez , who participated in peaceful demonstrations .
“ The coronavirus task force reported in the past 48 hours that one of the primary reasons many states , including California , are experiencing a spike is directly related to the protests and marches ( not church gatherings ) , ” he continued . “ What is next ?

VARNEY : Look , you 've got to get a deal on this fiscal cliff , and it ca n't be just any old deal , it 's got to be a real deal that offers a real chance , a real certainty , that our debt will come under control in the future . They want a fiscal cliff deal , if you do n't get it , and it 's got to be a real deal , then we will be downgraded , not just continuing under negative watch as they say . But no , we will be downgraded . We will lose our triple A rating which we have at the moment according to Moody 's . [ Fox News , America 's Newsroom , 11/13/12 ]
FACT : Moody 's Is Not Set To Downgrade If Budget Negotiations Fail
Moody 's Would Maintain AAA Credit Rating Even If Negotiations Failed . Reuters reported that if Congress can not reach an agreement on the debt , Moody 's will not necessarily downgrade U.S. debt :
If an agreement in Congress can not be reached before year-end , the automatic spending cuts would go into effect , but not necessarily lead to a downgrade , said Moody 's , highlighting that the immediate fiscal shock would improve government finances in the short-term , but are likely to result in recession and higher unemployment . Still , the ratings agency maintains that even if the government can not agree and the economy goes over the cliff “ we would maintain our Aaa rating with a negative outlook and await evidence that the economy could rebound from the shock before considering a return to a stable outlook. ” [ Reuters , 11/7/12 ]
Moody 's : U.S . Rating Will Be Downgraded Only If Debt Reduction Is Not Addressed . Moody 's stated that a downgrade would only take effect “ if negotiations fail to produce policies that lead to debt stabilization and ultimately reduction. ” The agency further commented that a downward trend in debt to GDP ratio would affirm the U.S. ' current triple A rating .

MacCALLUM : This administration was the first to preside over a downgrade of U.S. debt . We hope this is n't something we are going to get used to . [ Fox News , America 's Newsroom , 11/13/12 ]

Chambers : Downgrade Due To Debate Over Debt Ceiling . In an August 5 , 2011 , Wall Street Journal article discussing Standard & Poor 's decision to downgrade U.S. government debt , John Chambers , the chairman of S & P 's sovereign ratings committee cited political debate as a reason for their decision to downgrade , claiming the “ conclusion was pretty much motivated by all of the debate about the raising of the debt ceiling ... It involved a level of brinkmanship greater than what we had expected earlier in the year. ” [ The Wall Street Journal , 8/5/11 ]
Paul Krugman : Republicans Threatened To “ Disrupt The Essential Business Of Government. ” In explaining the downgrade , New York Times columnist Paul Krugman wrote that Republicans used the debt ceiling as a bargaining chip for policy concessions , which raised economic uncertainty :
The facts of the crisis over the debt ceiling are n't complicated . Republicans have , in effect , taken America hostage , threatening to undermine the economy and disrupt the essential business of government unless they get policy concessions they would never have been able to enact through legislation . And Democrats -- who would have been justified in rejecting this extortion altogether -- have , in fact , gone a long way toward meeting those Republican demands . [ The New York Times , 7/28/2011 ]
Jeff Madrick : “ S & P Downgrade Brought On By Republican Obstructionism. ” In a post for the Roosevelt Institute where he is a senior fellow , former New York Times economics columnist Jeff Madrick wrote that the S & P downgrade was due to Republican obstructionism :
For all of S & P 's handwringing about the nation 's debt problems , Congressional recalcitrance was the driving issue . So when the press says neither the Democrats nor the Republicans can escape blame , it is in truth nonsense . The showdown caused the downgrade , not the nation 's financial liabilities , and Republicans deliberately caused it in pursuit of their own political and ideological goals .

Standard & Poor 's : Debt Burden Likely To Grow Due To Republican Intransigence . In its report explaining the downgrade of U.S. credit , Standard and Poor 's singled out Republicans for their unwillingness to compromise on tax cuts . From the report :
Even assuming that at least $ 2.1 trillion of the spending reductions the act envisages are implemented , we maintain our view that the U.S. net general government debt burden ( all levels of government combined , excluding liquid financial assets ) will likely continue to grow . Under our revised base case fiscal scenario -- which we consider to be consistent with a 'AA+ ' long-term rating and a negative outlook -- we now project that net general government debt would rise from an estimated 74 % of GDP by the end of 2011 to 79 % in 2015 and 85 % by 2021 . [ ... ] Compared with previous projections , our revised base case scenario now assumes that the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts , due to expire by the end of 2012 , remain in place . We have changed our assumption on this because the majority of Republicans in Congress continue to resist any measure that would raise revenues , a position we believe Congress reinforced by passing the act .

From CBO :
The budgetary cost of extending the expiring tax provisions would be lower if certain provisions were allowed to expire that otherwise would apply to some high-income households . According to JCT and CBO 's estimates , if the AMT was indexed for inflation beginning in 2012 and all of the other expiring tax provisions were extended except for the specific provisions affecting high-income taxpayers ( and the payroll tax cut ) , revenues would be lower and outlays for refundable credits would be higher than $ 288 billion in fiscal year 2013 and by $ 382 billion in fiscal year 2014 , compared with CBO 's baseline projections . CBO estimates that such changes would increase real GDP by 1.3 percent ( by 0.3 percent to 2.3 percent under CBO 's full range of assumptions ) , and increase full-time-equivalent employment by 1.6 million ( with a range from 0.5 million to 2.8 million ) in the fourth quarter of 2013 .

media_bias,NewsBusters,2,https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/tim-graham/2020/04/15/column-bidens-protective-political-calculators,Column: Biden's Protective Political Calculators,2020-04-15,,"Almost three weeks after she went on the record with her sexual-assault allegations against Joe Biden , The New York Times and The Washington Post have issued their own investigative reports on Tara Reade , who briefly worked for Senator Biden on Capitol Hill in 1992 and 1993 .
She claimed Biden penetrated her with his fingers . There are no eyewitnesses . You couldn ’ t build a case in court with this . What you could do is put a dent in someone ’ s political appeal , especially someone who boasts of passing the Violence Against Women Act . When asked by his media columnist Ben Smith about whether the delay was out of concern for Biden ’ s electoral chances , New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet protested energetically .
“ I can ’ t make that calculation . I won ’ t . I won ’ t let my head or my heart go there , ” Baquet proclaimed . “ I think once you start making those kinds of calculations , you are not a journalist anymore . You ’ re some sort of political actor . ”
Come on . Every story that paints journalists as heroes at the movies , like Watergate and the Pentagon Papers , made them political actors . They were political actors when they poured gallons of sugary goop on Barack Obama , and they were political actors when they threw everything they had to stop Donald Trump from winning the White House . The timing on accusations like these often betray political calculation .
The networks are still delaying on Tara Reade . You can always demonstrate the media ’ s political calculations by noticing they ’ re not based on the evidence as much as they ’ re based on who is accused .
In the spring of 1991 , The New York Times spread the unsubstantiated gossip that Nancy Reagan had an affair with Frank Sinatra , according to the sleazy author Kitty Kelley , and the networks quickly followed . In the fall , these liberal titans all jumped quickly on NPR unfurling Anita Hill ’ s unproven sex-harassment charges against Clarence Thomas .
But in 1994 , this entire liberal media mob waited three months to notice Paula Jones charging Bill Clinton with sexual harassment . They all heard Jones make her allegations at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February , and aired nothing ( well , ABC gave it 16 seconds ) .
In 1999 , Juanita Broaddrick taped an interview and alleged Clinton raped her in Little Rock . NBC News sat on their interview with Broaddrick for weeks , until Clinton was acquitted by the Senate . Then it was “ safe ” to air , but even then , they all treated it like a distasteful one-day story .
In 2008 , The New York Times ran a sleazy story suggesting John McCain was having an affair with Vicki Iseman , a lobbyist . “ Convinced the relationship had become romantic , some of his top advisers intervened to protect the candidate from himself. ” Iseman successfully sued them for damages .

Try to figure out how this differs dramatically from a presidential election . Only the term of office is different – and the ideology of the man being painted as a monster .","Almost three weeks after she went on the record with her sexual-assault allegations against Joe Biden, The New York Times and The Washington Post have issued their own investigative reports on Tara Reade, who briefly worked for Senator Biden on Capitol Hill in 1992 and 1993.

She claimed Biden penetrated her with his fingers. There are no eyewitnesses. You couldn’t build a case in court with this. What you could do is put a dent in someone’s political appeal, especially someone who boasts of passing the Violence Against Women Act. When asked by his media columnist Ben Smith about whether the delay was out of concern for Biden’s electoral chances, New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet protested energetically.

“I can’t make that calculation. I won’t. I won’t let my head or my heart go there,” Baquet proclaimed. “I think once you start making those kinds of calculations, you are not a journalist anymore. You’re some sort of political actor.”

Come on. Every story that paints journalists as heroes at the movies, like Watergate and the Pentagon Papers, made them political actors. They were political actors when they poured gallons of sugary goop on Barack Obama, and they were political actors when they threw everything they had to stop Donald Trump from winning the White House. The timing on accusations like these often betray political calculation.

The networks are still delaying on Tara Reade. You can always demonstrate the media’s political calculations by noticing they’re not based on the evidence as much as they’re based on who is accused.

In the spring of 1991, The New York Times spread the unsubstantiated gossip that Nancy Reagan had an affair with Frank Sinatra, according to the sleazy author Kitty Kelley, and the networks quickly followed. In the fall, these liberal titans all jumped quickly on NPR unfurling Anita Hill’s unproven sex-harassment charges against Clarence Thomas.

But in 1994, this entire liberal media mob waited three months to notice Paula Jones charging Bill Clinton with sexual harassment. They all heard Jones make her allegations at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February, and aired nothing (well, ABC gave it 16 seconds).

In 1999, Juanita Broaddrick taped an interview and alleged Clinton raped her in Little Rock. NBC News sat on their interview with Broaddrick for weeks, until Clinton was acquitted by the Senate. Then it was “safe” to air, but even then, they all treated it like a distasteful one-day story.

In 2008, The New York Times ran a sleazy story suggesting John McCain was having an affair with Vicki Iseman, a lobbyist. “Convinced the relationship had become romantic, some of his top advisers intervened to protect the candidate from himself.” Iseman successfully sued them for damages.

In the Trump era, the timing can be painfully obvious. The Washington Post only took hours to report the Access Hollywood tape. Last summer, when magazine writer E. Jean Carroll accused Trump of raping her inside a New York department store dressing room, NBC News waited about six hours to report it.

Most egregiously, there were the unsupported charges of teenage rape against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in 2018, which drew hundreds of minutes of network news time. Dean Baquet at the Times said this was different than Biden. It was a “already in a public forum in a large way,” in “the biggest political story in the country.”

Trump .
President Trump is different from any political leader we ’ ve seen in the presidency – at least since Andrew Jackson ( 1828-36 ) . As a result , reporters and those in the elite political class literally have no idea how to understand him . Each day , they are faced with a president who doesn ’ t fit the norms of politics as usual , and their persistent instinct has been to attack .
I have watched this hostility since then-candidate Trump announced his bid for the presidency at Trump Tower nearly two years ago on June 16 , 2015 [ CM1 ] . It is a major reason why I decided to write Understanding Trump , which was released Tuesday .
In fact , President Trump ’ s candidacy announcement , as I explain in the first chapter [ CM2 ] of `` Understanding Trump , '' is a great case study on how completely incapable the D.C. media insiders have been in comprehending the President – and why the American people elected him .
“ Think about the torrent of criticism Trump received for his announcement event at Trump Tower . In addition to the intense criticism he received for what he said about people who are in the country illegally , Trump was mocked for ad-libbing his speech , boasting about his wealth , and his theatrics . The elites snubbed him , but his message resonated with normal Americans .
“ Trump understood that since he was running as an outsider , the more he sounded like a politician , the more it undercut his message . So he abandoned his prepared remarks and spoke extemporaneously . This choice to go without the security of written text at such a big moment was , in fact , an act of extraordinary message discipline . The pundits accused him of ‘ rambling . ’
“ Trump also understood that most Americans believed that their voices were not being heard , that the only people whom politicians listened to were ones who could cut big checks . So Trump spent a lot of time boasting about his wealth and promising to self-finance his campaign . In the following days , much attention was paid to whether Trump was really worth $ 9 billion , as he claimed , or if he was worth ‘ only ’ about $ 2 billion .
“ The frustrated voters Trump was reaching out to heard only one word—billion . And they understood that they finally had a candidate who would not be bought . ”
The media ’ s immediate reaction to President Trump ’ s announcement was full blown hostility . They couldn ’ t imagine that people would ever consider him a serious candidate . They didn ’ t care what he said . They didn ’ t care how the American people responded to his message . But within a few weeks , the media ’ s offensive had completely failed .
“ After weeks of nonstop media criticism and declarations that his announcement in mid-June had been a disaster , the first polls were released that included Trump . After one month of Trump campaigning , he was leading in an average of all the polls , and he lost the lead only for one three-day period for the rest of the primary election .
“ You would think this would have been cause for the media and establishment voices to pause and reconsider their assumptions about Trump , but the coverage and analysis has only gotten worse from there . ”
Twenty-four months later , the hostility hasn ’ t changed a bit . The elite reporters and pundits remain baffled and predisposed to attack a president they don ’ t understand .
I wrote `` Understanding Trump '' for the grassroots activists across the nation who are dedicated to holding Washington accountable and ensuring it once again serves the American people , instead of the big government , monied special interests and political influence peddlers .
Just this month , a reporter asked me via email to comment on a story . The entire premise of the clearly biased article was that President Trump had been undoing Obama initiatives but not replacing them with anything of his own .
Congress is grinding forward on health care , tax cuts , deregulation , infrastructure , and rebuilding the military – any one of which could define a presidential legacy . I reminded the reporter that it took nine months to pass President Ronald Reagan ’ s tax cuts and 18 months to pass welfare reform when I was Speaker .
Citing the current bull market being spurred by the surge in small business , entrepreneurial , and CEO confidence , I pointed out that in the first five months of the Trump presidency , the Trump effect has added $ 3.3 trillion to stock values [ CM3 ] . This is nearly four times the size of Obama ’ s media-lauded $ 900 billion stimulus package in 2009 .
Finally , I told the reporter the misguided assertion completely ignores President Trump ’ s meeting in Riyadh , Saudi Arabia , which resulted in over $ 400 billion in contracts for American jobs and the potential for a Sunni-American alliance .

Vittert was reporting in Lafayette Park , D.C. and covering protests sparked by the death of George Floyd . Vittert and his crew were accosted and chased out of the area by protesters early Saturday morning , footage captured by ███ News Foundation shows . ( RELATED : CNN Correspondent Arrested Live On-Air During Minneapolis Riots )
Many of the groups contacted by ███ previously publicly issued statements condemning Friday ’ s arrest of CNN correspondent Omar Jimenez and his crew . The two events , while both suppression of press , do have a noteworthy difference . The CNN crew was arrested by police , and the Fox News crew was attacked by protesters .
First Amendment Coalition and Freedom of the Press Foundation did not respond to requests for comment from ███ .
The Committee to Protect Journalists ( CPJ ) told ███ that it did not have “ have a specific statement in that specific incident ” when asked for its thoughts regarding the attack against Vittert . CPJ wrote that it is “ investigating several reported attacks on journalists covering protests around the country and urges police and protesters alike to refrain from targeting journalists so that they can safely cover these newsworthy event . ”
When asked for clarification regarding whether CPJ specifically condemns the attack on Vittert , the group wrote that it is “ investigating , ” adding they “ do not make statements without doing our own reporting first . ”
CPJ condemned the CNN reporter ’ s arrest shortly after the incident occurred Friday morning . It also issued a general statement condemning all attacks against journalists .
“ It ’ s difficult to imagine what police needed as ‘ confirmation that these individuals were members of the media ’ beyond Omar Jimenez showing his press badge while he spoke into a CNN camera surrounded by his producer and crew , ” CPJ Program Director Carlos Martinez de la Serna said , according to its website . “ Journalists have a responsibility to report on matters of public interest , such as protests , and should be able to freely cover these events without fear of retaliation from authorities . These arrests ring of intimidation and are simply outrageous . ”
CPJ also issued a tweet condemning the arrest , had its advocacy director partake in a Newsy interview and retweeted numerous comments on the incident .
The Society of Professional Journalists ( SPJ ) president explained that it had not yet issued a public statement regarding the Vittert attack because they “ missed this one . ”
“ I would just say we missed this one , ” Patricia Gallagher Newberry , president of SPJ , told ███ when asked for comment on the protesters ’ attack . The group added that it was working on a statement “ that essentially calls on police and protesters to remember that journalists play a particular role in these news happenings and that we are there to tell the story . ”
“ We are going to double down on our position which is journalists should be free to do their jobs , they should not be impeded from doing their jobs they most certainly should not be attacked by protesters or police as they seek to do their jobs , ” Newberry said , adding that SPJ stands “ with journalists at this time when they ’ re being , yet again , vilified in America for simply doing their jobs . ”
Newberry then specifically condemned the protesters ’ actions against Vittert , calling the attack “ inexcusable. ” ( RELATED : Minneapolis 3rd Police Precinct On Fire After Officers Evacuate Building Amid George Floyd Riots )
“ He ’ s being taunted , he ’ s being called the f-word , he ’ s a journalist on the street trying to cover the story … he ’ s trying to do his job like every other journalist in America , ” Newberry told ███ . “ He , from what I could see of the video that I watched , he reacted exactly as he should have . He did not engage , he did not spit back any vitriol to his taunters , he walked away , he sought protection . ”
“ He behaved in an extremely responsible and ethical manner in the face of a great challenge to his safety … It ’ s not right for police to attack journalists , it ’ s not right for protesters to attack journalists . Not cool , what the protesters there in D.C. did to Mr. Vittert . ”
SPJ issued a general open letter to protesters and police Saturday evening urging them to allow journalists to do their jobs in covering the protests .
SPJ asks police officers to let journalists do their jobs in covering the # GeorgeFloyd protests . Take a moment and think before you take action against a journalist there to do their job .

SPJ previously specifically condemned Jimenez ’ s arrest and wrote that it “ demands answers from the Minnesota State Patrol . ”
“ Mr . Jimenez and his team were clearly doing nothing but their job – even politely offering to move to wherever police wanted them to go – but were handcuffed and taken into custody anyway , ” Newberry said in the CNN arrest incident . “ This is clearly a violation of the First Amendment and the Minnesota State Patrol owes them and the American people an explanation of why this occurred . This happened on live TV where we could all see . Sadly , it happens much more often than we know in this country and is not documented on live TV . ”
Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press ( RCFP ) condemned all attacks against reporters in a response to ███ .
“ No reporter should be harassed for doing their job and bringing us the news , ” RCFP Executive Director Bruce Brown said . “ Our attorneys are ready to assist any reporter who needs legal support . ”
RCFP confirmed that it did specifically condemn the attack against Vittert when pressed further by ███ .
“ Yes , Reporters Committee condemns the harassment and attacks on the Fox News reporter Leland Vittert , ” RCFP wrote .
The group “ strongly ” condemned the CNN arrest in a lengthy public statement on its website Friday .
“ We strongly condemn the Minnesota State Patrol ’ s arrest of a CNN news crew covering the protests in Minneapolis , who responded professionally and appropriately to the situation , ” RCFP wrote . “ The First Amendment protects newsgathering , and prohibits the government from using police power as a pretext for interfering with press freedoms . Arresting journalists to prevent reporting on a public demonstration is not acceptable . ”
“ News coverage of protests like the one in Minneapolis is essential to informing the public and understanding the concerns of our communities . While we are relieved that the news crew was ultimately released , we expect the Minnesota State Patrol to provide a full explanation as to why these reporters , who identified themselves as journalists , were taken into custody . ”","Some press groups condemned the attack by protesters against Fox News reporter Leland Vittert in Washington, D.C. but others remained silent – despite speaking out against the arrest of a CNN reporter one day earlier.

First Amendment Coalition and Freedom of the Press Foundation did not respond to requests for comment from the Daily Caller.

The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) told the Daily Caller that it did not have “have a specific statement in that specific incident” when asked for its thoughts regarding the attack against Vittert. CPJ wrote that it is “investigating several reported attacks on journalists covering protests around the country and urges police and protesters alike to refrain from targeting journalists so that they can safely cover these newsworthy event.”

When asked for clarification regarding whether CPJ specifically condemns the attack on Vittert, the group wrote that it is “investigating,” adding they “do not make statements without doing our own reporting first.”

CPJ condemned the CNN reporter’s arrest shortly after the incident occurred Friday morning. It also issued a general statement condemning all attacks against journalists.

“It’s difficult to imagine what police needed as ‘confirmation that these individuals were members of the media’ beyond Omar Jimenez showing his press badge while he spoke into a CNN camera surrounded by his producer and crew,” CPJ Program Director Carlos Martinez de la Serna said, according to its website. “Journalists have a responsibility to report on matters of public interest, such as protests, and should be able to freely cover these events without fear of retaliation from authorities. These arrests ring of intimidation and are simply outrageous.”

CPJ also issued a tweet condemning the arrest, had its advocacy director partake in a Newsy interview and retweeted numerous comments on the incident.

WATCH:

The Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ) president explained that it had not yet issued a public statement regarding the Vittert attack because they “missed this one.”

“I would just say we missed this one,” Patricia Gallagher Newberry, president of SPJ, told the Daily Caller when asked for comment on the protesters’ attack. The group added that it was working on a statement “that essentially calls on police and protesters to remember that journalists play a particular role in these news happenings and that we are there to tell the story.”

“We are going to double down on our position which is journalists should be free to do their jobs, they should not be impeded from doing their jobs they most certainly should not be attacked by protesters or police as they seek to do their jobs,” Newberry said, adding that SPJ stands “with journalists at this time when they’re being, yet again, vilified in America for simply doing their jobs.”

Newberry then specifically condemned the protesters’ actions against Vittert, calling the attack “inexcusable.” (RELATED: Minneapolis 3rd Police Precinct On Fire After Officers Evacuate Building Amid George Floyd Riots)

“He’s being taunted, he’s being called the f-word, he’s a journalist on the street trying to cover the story … he’s trying to do his job like every other journalist in America,” Newberry told the Daily Caller. “He, from what I could see of the video that I watched, he reacted exactly as he should have. He did not engage, he did not spit back any vitriol to his taunters, he walked away, he sought protection.”

“He behaved in an extremely responsible and ethical manner in the face of a great challenge to his safety … It’s not right for police to attack journalists, it’s not right for protesters to attack journalists. Not cool, what the protesters there in D.C. did to Mr. Vittert.”

SPJ issued a general open letter to protesters and police Saturday evening urging them to allow journalists to do their jobs in covering the protests.

SPJ asks police officers to let journalists do their jobs in covering the #GeorgeFloyd protests. Take a moment and think before you take action against a journalist there to do their job.

SPJ previously specifically condemned Jimenez’s arrest and wrote that it “demands answers from the Minnesota State Patrol.”

“Mr. Jimenez and his team were clearly doing nothing but their job – even politely offering to move to wherever police wanted them to go – but were handcuffed and taken into custody anyway,” Newberry said in the CNN arrest incident. “This is clearly a violation of the First Amendment and the Minnesota State Patrol owes them and the American people an explanation of why this occurred. This happened on live TV where we could all see. Sadly, it happens much more often than we know in this country and is not documented on live TV.”

Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press (RCFP) condemned all attacks against reporters in a response to the Daily Caller.

“No reporter should be harassed for doing their job and bringing us the news,” RCFP Executive Director Bruce Brown said. “Our attorneys are ready to assist any reporter who needs legal support.”

RCFP confirmed that it did specifically condemn the attack against Vittert when pressed further by the Daily Caller.

“Yes, Reporters Committee condemns the harassment and attacks on the Fox News reporter Leland Vittert,” RCFP wrote.

The group “strongly” condemned the CNN arrest in a lengthy public statement on its website Friday.

“We strongly condemn the Minnesota State Patrol’s arrest of a CNN news crew covering the protests in Minneapolis, who responded professionally and appropriately to the situation,” RCFP wrote. “The First Amendment protects newsgathering, and prohibits the government from using police power as a pretext for interfering with press freedoms. Arresting journalists to prevent reporting on a public demonstration is not acceptable.”

“News coverage of protests like the one in Minneapolis is essential to informing the public and understanding the concerns of our communities. While we are relieved that the news crew was ultimately released, we expect the Minnesota State Patrol to provide a full explanation as to why these reporters, who identified themselves as journalists, were taken into custody.”",www.dailycaller.com,right,XOa8V3f0RuQBFFnV

media_bias,Breitbart News,2,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/05/11/new-york-times-proved-trumps-case-firing-comey/,How the New York Times Proved Trump’s Case for Firing James Comey,2017-05-11,Aaron Klein,"In an extensive article published last month that included interviews with more than 30 current and former law enforcement officials , congressional officials and other government employees , the New York Times published a stinging indictment of James B. Comey ’ s handling of the Hillary Clinton email probe .
The Times made the case that Comey violated FBI tradition , bypassed the Justice Department and went rogue on several occasions in a manner that clearly impacted the 2016 presidential election .
In a letter on Tuesday from Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein recommending that Comey be fired , Rosenstein specifically cited Comey ’ s alleged mishandling of the Clinton email probe as justification for Comey ’ s removal from office .
“ I can not defend the Director ’ s handling of the conclusion of the investigation of secretary Clinton ’ s emails , ” Rosenstein wrote . “ And I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken . Almost everyone agrees that the Director made serious mistakes ; it is one of the few issues that unites people of diverse perspectives . ”
Rosenstein continued : “ The Director was wrong to usurp the Attorney General ’ s authority on July 5 , 2016 , and announce his conclusion that the case should be closed without prosecution . It is not the function of the Director to make such an announcement . At most , the Director should have said the FBI had completed its investigation and presented its findings to federal prosecutors . ”
That is precisely the case made by the Times ’ April 22 article , titled , “ Comey Tried to Shield the F.B.I . From Politics . Then He Shaped an Election . ”
The Times says that for its article it interviewed “ more than 30 current and former law enforcement , congressional and other government officials . ”
The newspaper concluded that Comey ’ s decision to inform Congress that the FBI was reopening the Clinton email probe less than two weeks before the presidential election “ violate [ ed ] the policies of an agency that does not reveal its investigations or do anything that may influence an election . ”
The article related that Comey decided to plunge the FBI “ into the molten center of a bitter election ” in part because he feared “ the backlash that would come if it were revealed after the election that the F.B.I . had been investigating the next president and had kept it a secret . ”
A significant motivating factor for Comey ’ s rogue approach toward the Clinton email probe , the Times revealed , was his distrust of senior officials at the Justice Department , especially then-Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch , whom , the newspaper reported , “ Mr . Comey believed had subtly helped play down the Clinton investigation . ”
Indeed , according to the Times , Comey was aware of the existence of a document written by a Democratic operative that allegedly indicated Lynch would have protected Hillary Clinton in the email probe .
The FBI had further information that the alleged Lynch document had been hacked by Russian intelligence , leading Comey to fear that Moscow could leak the document to call into question the independence of the U.S. government ’ s Clinton email probe , the Times reported .
In his letter from Tuesday , Rosenstein argues that if Comey believed Lynch to be compromised he should have sought her recusal instead of taking matters into his own hands .
“ The Director now defends his decision by asserting that he believed Attorney General Lynch had a conflict , ” Rosenstein wrote . “ But the FBI Director is never empowered to supplant federal prosecutors and assume command of the Justice Department . There is a well-established process for other officials to step in when a conflict requires the recusal of the Attorney General . ”
Indeed , according to the Times , after it became clear that the F.B.I . did not discover Clinton emails showing intent to mishandle classified information – the agency believed those emails were among the correspondence deleted by Clinton – Comey made the decision to bypass the Justice Department and explain the case to the public .
Nine months into the investigation , it became clear to Mr. Comey that Mrs. Clinton was almost certainly not going to face charges . He quietly began work on talking points , toying with the notion that in the midst of a bitter presidential campaign , a Justice Department led by Democrats may not have the credibility to close the case , and that he alone should explain that decision to the public .
Comey ’ s decision was further fueled by the alleged document written by a Democratic operative hacked by the Russians , a document that in Comey ’ s view raised “ questions about [ Lynch ’ s ] independence , ” the Times reported .
Instead of seeking Lynch ’ s recusal , as Rosenstein would later outline as the proper course of action , Comey decided to go at it alone , take matters into his own hands and make his public pronouncements about Clinton ’ s email case without the Justice Department .
The Times cited former Justice officials as “ deeply skeptical ” of Comey ’ s alleged reasoning :
Former Justice Department officials are deeply skeptical of this account . If Mr. Comey believed that Ms. Lynch were compromised , they say , why did he not seek her recusal ? Mr. Comey never raised this issue with Ms. Lynch or the deputy attorney general , Sally Q. Yates , former officials said .
Mr. Comey ’ s defenders regard this as one of the untold stories of the Clinton investigation , one they say helps explain his decision-making . But former Justice Department officials say the F.B.I . never uncovered evidence tying Ms. Lynch to the document ’ s author , and are convinced that Mr. Comey wanted an excuse to put himself in the spotlight .
Comey ’ s decision to go rogue was solidified , according to the Times ’ account , after Lynch ’ s infamous tarmac meeting at the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport in which former President Bill Clinton , the husband of the FBI ’ s main subject in a criminal probe , boarded the attorney general ’ s plane and reportedly stayed there for about twenty minutes .
Yet Comey still did not seek Lynch ’ s recusal . The Times article related that after the tarmac episode , Comey “ knew for sure that when there was something to say about the case , he alone would say it . ”
Afterwards , Comey held the press conference at which he criticized Clinton ’ s private email server as “ extremely careless ” before finally stating that “ no charges are appropriate in this case . ”
With his pronouncements , Comey offered judgments and legal conclusions many argue are out of the purview of the FBI , which is charged with documenting the evidence and handing it over to the Justice Department .
The Times cited unnamed “ frustrated ” prosecutors at the Justice Department complaining that Comey should have first consulted with them .
Comey ’ s injection into the presidential race did not end there . Less than two weeks before the election , the FBI discovered a trove of Clinton emails on the laptop of Anthony Weiner , the estranged husband of long-time top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin . Some of the emails , according to reports , originated on Clinton ’ s old BlackBerry server that she used before setting up her private home server and some believe may have contained the deleted messages .
Comey ’ s decision centered on whether to follow FBI tradition and keep quiet about the reopening of the case , or inform Congress about the ongoing investigation , which , the Times related , “ everyone acknowledged would create a political furor . ”
Eventually , Comey decided to go rogue again and inform Congress .
Lynch was against the decision , the Times reported , and the Justice Department implored the FBI not to impact the presidential campaign in its final days . The Times reported that “ even at the F.B.I. , agents who supported their high-profile director were stunned . ”
“ Career prosecutors and political appointees ” at the Justice Department quietly criticized not only Comey but Lynch for failing to stop the FBI director , the Times documented .
A chorus of former attorneys general and deputy attorneys general from across the political spectrum publicly criticized Comey ’ s move . For example , Jamie S. Gorelick , who served as deputy attorney general during the Clinton administration , opined that Comey was “ damaging our democracy . ”
Writing in the Washington Post on October 29 , Gorelick slammed Comey ’ s decision to so publicly reopen the case just before the election as “ antithetical to the interests of justice , putting a thumb on the scale of this election and damaging our democracy . ”
Gorelick co-authored the Washington Post opinion piece , titled , “ James Comey is damaging our democracy , ” with Larry Thompson , who served under the George W. Bush administration as deputy attorney general from 2001 to 2003 .
Gorelick ’ s piece was referenced in Rosenstein ’ s letter on Tuesday recommending that Comey be fired , writing , “ I can not defend the director ’ s handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton ’ s emails . ”
Rosenstein referenced the criticism of Comey from other former attorneys general and deputy attorneys general .
Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey , who served under President George W. Bush , observed that the Director stepped far outside his purview in disclosing the recommendation in that fashion “ because the FBI director doesn ’ t make that decision . ”
Alberto Gonzales , who also served as Attorney General under President George W. Bush , called the decision an error in judgment .
Eric Holder , who served as Deputy Attorney General under President Clinton and Attorney General under President Obama , said that the Director ’ s decision “ was incorrect . It violated long-standing Justice Department policies and traditions. ” Holder concluded that the Director broke with these fundamental principles and negatively affected public trust in both the Justice Department and the FBI .
Donald Ayer , who served as Deputy Attorney General under President George H.W . Bush , along with other former Justice Department officials , was “ astonished and perplexed ” by the decision to “ break with longstanding practices followed by officials of both parties during past elections . ”

In a letter on Tuesday from Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein recommending that Comey be fired, Rosenstein specifically cited Comey’s alleged mishandling of the Clinton email probe as justification for Comey’s removal from office.

“I cannot defend the Director’s handling of the conclusion of the investigation of secretary Clinton’s emails,” Rosenstein wrote. “And I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken. Almost everyone agrees that the Director made serious mistakes; it is one of the few issues that unites people of diverse perspectives.”

Rosenstein continued: “The Director was wrong to usurp the Attorney General’s authority on July 5, 2016, and announce his conclusion that the case should be closed without prosecution. It is not the function of the Director to make such an announcement. At most, the Director should have said the FBI had completed its investigation and presented its findings to federal prosecutors.”

That is precisely the case made by the Times’ April 22 article, titled, “Comey Tried to Shield the F.B.I. From Politics. Then He Shaped an Election.”

The Times says that for its article it interviewed “more than 30 current and former law enforcement, congressional and other government officials.”

The newspaper concluded that Comey’s decision to inform Congress that the FBI was reopening the Clinton email probe less than two weeks before the presidential election “violate[ed] the policies of an agency that does not reveal its investigations or do anything that may influence an election.”

The article related that Comey decided to plunge the FBI “into the molten center of a bitter election” in part because he feared “the backlash that would come if it were revealed after the election that the F.B.I. had been investigating the next president and had kept it a secret.”

Failed to seek Lynch recusal

A significant motivating factor for Comey’s rogue approach toward the Clinton email probe, the Times revealed, was his distrust of senior officials at the Justice Department, especially then-Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch, whom, the newspaper reported, “Mr. Comey believed had subtly helped play down the Clinton investigation.”

Indeed, according to the Times, Comey was aware of the existence of a document written by a Democratic operative that allegedly indicated Lynch would have protected Hillary Clinton in the email probe.

The FBI had further information that the alleged Lynch document had been hacked by Russian intelligence, leading Comey to fear that Moscow could leak the document to call into question the independence of the U.S. government’s Clinton email probe, the Times reported.

In his letter from Tuesday, Rosenstein argues that if Comey believed Lynch to be compromised he should have sought her recusal instead of taking matters into his own hands.

“The Director now defends his decision by asserting that he believed Attorney General Lynch had a conflict,” Rosenstein wrote. “But the FBI Director is never empowered to supplant federal prosecutors and assume command of the Justice Department. There is a well-established process for other officials to step in when a conflict requires the recusal of the Attorney General.”

Indeed, according to the Times, after it became clear that the F.B.I. did not discover Clinton emails showing intent to mishandle classified information – the agency believed those emails were among the correspondence deleted by Clinton – Comey made the decision to bypass the Justice Department and explain the case to the public.

The paper reported:

Nine months into the investigation, it became clear to Mr. Comey that Mrs. Clinton was almost certainly not going to face charges. He quietly began work on talking points, toying with the notion that in the midst of a bitter presidential campaign, a Justice Department led by Democrats may not have the credibility to close the case, and that he alone should explain that decision to the public.

Comey’s decision was further fueled by the alleged document written by a Democratic operative hacked by the Russians, a document that in Comey’s view raised “questions about [Lynch’s] independence,” the Times reported.

Instead of seeking Lynch’s recusal, as Rosenstein would later outline as the proper course of action, Comey decided to go at it alone, take matters into his own hands and make his public pronouncements about Clinton’s email case without the Justice Department.

The Times cited former Justice officials as “deeply skeptical” of Comey’s alleged reasoning:

Former Justice Department officials are deeply skeptical of this account. If Mr. Comey believed that Ms. Lynch were compromised, they say, why did he not seek her recusal? Mr. Comey never raised this issue with Ms. Lynch or the deputy attorney general, Sally Q. Yates, former officials said.

Mr. Comey’s defenders regard this as one of the untold stories of the Clinton investigation, one they say helps explain his decision-making. But former Justice Department officials say the F.B.I. never uncovered evidence tying Ms. Lynch to the document’s author, and are convinced that Mr. Comey wanted an excuse to put himself in the spotlight.

Comey’s decision to go rogue was solidified, according to the Times’ account, after Lynch’s infamous tarmac meeting at the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport in which former President Bill Clinton, the husband of the FBI’s main subject in a criminal probe, boarded the attorney general’s plane and reportedly stayed there for about twenty minutes.

Yet Comey still did not seek Lynch’s recusal. The Times article related that after the tarmac episode, Comey “knew for sure that when there was something to say about the case, he alone would say it.”

Made legal conclusions

Afterwards, Comey held the press conference at which he criticized Clinton’s private email server as “extremely careless” before finally stating that “no charges are appropriate in this case.”

With his pronouncements, Comey offered judgments and legal conclusions many argue are out of the purview of the FBI, which is charged with documenting the evidence and handing it over to the Justice Department.

The Times cited unnamed “frustrated” prosecutors at the Justice Department complaining that Comey should have first consulted with them.

Went rogue a second time despite FBI tradition

Comey’s injection into the presidential race did not end there. Less than two weeks before the election, the FBI discovered a trove of Clinton emails on the laptop of Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of long-time top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Some of the emails, according to reports, originated on Clinton’s old BlackBerry server that she used before setting up her private home server and some believe may have contained the deleted messages.

Comey’s decision centered on whether to follow FBI tradition and keep quiet about the reopening of the case, or inform Congress about the ongoing investigation, which, the Times related, “everyone acknowledged would create a political furor.”

Eventually, Comey decided to go rogue again and inform Congress.

Lynch was against the decision, the Times reported, and the Justice Department implored the FBI not to impact the presidential campaign in its final days. The Times reported that “even at the F.B.I., agents who supported their high-profile director were stunned.”

“Career prosecutors and political appointees” at the Justice Department quietly criticized not only Comey but Lynch for failing to stop the FBI director, the Times documented.

A chorus of former attorneys general and deputy attorneys general from across the political spectrum publicly criticized Comey’s move. For example, Jamie S. Gorelick, who served as deputy attorney general during the Clinton administration, opined that Comey was “damaging our democracy.”

Writing in the Washington Post on October 29, Gorelick slammed Comey’s decision to so publicly reopen the case just before the election as “antithetical to the interests of justice, putting a thumb on the scale of this election and damaging our democracy.”

Gorelick co-authored the Washington Post opinion piece, titled, “James Comey is damaging our democracy,” with Larry Thompson, who served under the George W. Bush administration as deputy attorney general from 2001 to 2003.

Gorelick’s piece was referenced in Rosenstein’s letter on Tuesday recommending that Comey be fired, writing, “I cannot defend the director’s handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton’s emails.”

Rosenstein referenced the criticism of Comey from other former attorneys general and deputy attorneys general.

Besides Gorelick’s Post piece, Rosenstein’s letter further outlined:

Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey, who served under President George W. Bush, observed that the Director stepped far outside his purview in disclosing the recommendation in that fashion “because the FBI director doesn’t make that decision.”

Alberto Gonzales, who also served as Attorney General under President George W. Bush, called the decision an error in judgment.

Eric Holder, who served as Deputy Attorney General under President Clinton and Attorney General under President Obama, said that the Director’s decision “was incorrect. It violated long-standing Justice Department policies and traditions.” Holder concluded that the Director broke with these fundamental principles and negatively affected public trust in both the Justice Department and the FBI.

Donald Ayer, who served as Deputy Attorney General under President George H.W. Bush, along with other former Justice Department officials, was “astonished and perplexed” by the decision to “break with longstanding practices followed by officials of both parties during past elections.”

Fox News has repeatedly gone to former Justice Department official Robert Driscoll to comment on the Russia investigations, but what viewers don't hear is that he's also the attorney for Maria Butina, the suspected Russian spy charged with criminal counts.

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:

Cable news programs have been full of commentators talking about the president's legal problems and the question of possible Russian collusion. One frequent analyst on Fox News has an unusual credential. Robert Driscoll is a lawyer who represents a woman accused of being a Russian spy. But viewers don't always know about that credential. Here's NPR's David Folkenflik.

DAVID FOLKENFLIK, BYLINE: The principle at stake was encapsulated pretty neatly back in May by, of all people, Fox News host Laura Ingraham. She was mocking the frequent TV appearances of the attorney for Stormy Daniels, who alleges she was paid during the 2016 campaign to hush up her earlier affair with President Trump.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""MEDIA BUZZ"")

LAURA INGRAHAM: There has been quite a few - have been quite a few mistruths stated by Michael Avenatti, who is brought on to some of these other networks as almost, like, an analyst. They almost forget that he's representing a client.

FOLKENFLIK: Ingraham herself has periodically interviewed Robert Driscoll. He was chief of staff for the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division under George W. Bush. This year, Driscoll spoke about the president's legal challenges, including questions of his ties to Russia, the larger investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller, the credibility of the FBI and the prosecution of former Trump campaign chief Paul Manafort.

Back in May, Driscoll spoke on Fox News about the hush payments to Trump's alleged past mistresses.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""OUTNUMBERED OVERTIME WITH HARRIS FAULKNER"")

ROBERT DRISCOLL: I think you can power through that because the public kind of accepted that. And if he can, you know, keep his eyes on the prize and get exonerated on the Russia stuff, I think he can weather the storm on this.

FOLKENFLIK: The Russian stuff - that's relevant here. Driscoll is defending an accused Russian spy, Maria Butina, against federal charges. If prosecutors are correct, she is very much part of the larger story of Russian interference in the 2016 elections. Those charges became public back in July. Fox interviewed him about the case in subsequent days.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: And coming up in this show, our exclusive interview with the attorney representing accused Russian spy Maria Butina. Robert Driscoll will join us live momentarily.

FOLKENFLIK: Yet Driscoll was interviewed at least three more times by Fox News on other matters related to Russia, such as Trump's withdrawal of security clearance from former CIA Chief John Brennan, whose intense criticism of the president centers on Russia.

Fox viewers were not told of Driscoll's role as Butina's defense attorney. Driscoll tells NPR there's no conflict because she is being prosecuted by the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, not Mueller.

DRISCOLL: Most of the contact done has been pretty general about the powers of the, you know, special counsel and, yeah, how long things take and those type of general questions. And Maria's case was not - it didn't overlap with any of those.

FOLKENFLIK: Not everyone agrees.

SID BEDINGFIELD: Once he took the job as her lawyer, his status changed.

FOLKENFLIK: Sid Bedingfield is former executive vice president of CNN.

BEDINGFIELD: He's no longer an independent observer, but someone with a vested interest in the larger story of Russian engagement with the U.S. election process. And therefore, a news organization owes it to its readers and viewers to identify specifically what role he's playing in the larger story.

FOLKENFLIK: Fox did not know initially of Driscoll's role. He tells NPR he represented Butina as far back as February, when the Senate Intelligence Committee first sought her testimony in private. Driscoll says he only told news outlets of his involvement in July. Yet, he appeared several times as an analyst without Fox disclosing that to its viewers.

Fox News' top programming executive tells NPR the network is now reminding producers of its aim to make all relevant disclosures. David Folkenflik, NPR News.

They may cloak their self-interested campaign in the rhetoric of `` safety , '' but so do opponents of the free press .
It is no secret that the rise of social media has caught many in the traditional media industry flatfooted . The unfortunate demise of many austere news houses is cliché to the point of being a frequent presidential punching bag , and the digitization of information has absolutely driven that trend . Adding insult to injury , the advertising infrastructure that used to prop up traditional journalism has likewise become `` optimized , '' prompting journalists ' futures to be driven by the algorithmic whims of a perhaps too easily bamboozled public . I 'd be mad about this state of affairs , too .
But this does not justify privilege-seeking . It is easy to see how enhanced government control of the means of information distribution could have the happy effect of shoring up the positions of traditional media outlets . Any kind of controls that slow down the rate of information distribution could do this . Even better—the oversight board could be staffed by current or former members of the established press . After all , who better than they to determine what content is in the public interest ? And perhaps it just so happens that their current or former institutions happen to be the most trustworthy , and therefore the most often allowed on social media platforms… .
Society is always made worse off overall when specific industries are protected by the government . But this state of affairs is all the more frightening when the relevant industry concerns a factor so vital to governance as delivering the truth .
The situation is similar in the United States , as last week 's spectacle on Capitol Hill suggests . Here , as in the United Kingdom , many media outlets harbor grudges against social media platforms for their effects on the news industry and public opinion .
But there are key institutional differences that change the calculus .
The freedom of speech is a constitutionally protected right in America , but not in the U.K . Even though social media platforms are private companies , the cultural respect of free speech is jealously guarded here , and that influences people 's opinions on proper policy responses . Perhaps the cultural antibodies against violations of free speech are simply weaker in the U.K. Alternatively , perhaps Americans will misdirect our love of free speech into supporting public utility regulations on social media platforms that also violate the speech rights of social media platforms .
At the end of the day , media companies—vaunted though their profession may be in some circles—are still companies . And many of them are very big and very powerful . Some who call for social media oversight may truly have earnest motives . But surely all of them do not , and we should not allow the halo of `` the press '' to cloud our scrutiny of what may be simply an ugly business move .","In the states and abroad, policymakers and commentators are salivating over the opportunity to regulate social media content.

They may cloak their self-interested campaign in the rhetoric of ""safety,"" but so do opponents of the free press.

It is no secret that the rise of social media has caught many in the traditional media industry flatfooted. The unfortunate demise of many austere news houses is cliché to the point of being a frequent presidential punching bag, and the digitization of information has absolutely driven that trend. Adding insult to injury, the advertising infrastructure that used to prop up traditional journalism has likewise become ""optimized,"" prompting journalists' futures to be driven by the algorithmic whims of a perhaps too easily bamboozled public. I'd be mad about this state of affairs, too.

But this does not justify privilege-seeking. It is easy to see how enhanced government control of the means of information distribution could have the happy effect of shoring up the positions of traditional media outlets. Any kind of controls that slow down the rate of information distribution could do this. Even better—the oversight board could be staffed by current or former members of the established press. After all, who better than they to determine what content is in the public interest? And perhaps it just so happens that their current or former institutions happen to be the most trustworthy, and therefore the most often allowed on social media platforms… .

Society is always made worse off overall when specific industries are protected by the government. But this state of affairs is all the more frightening when the relevant industry concerns a factor so vital to governance as delivering the truth.

The situation is similar in the United States, as last week's spectacle on Capitol Hill suggests. Here, as in the United Kingdom, many media outlets harbor grudges against social media platforms for their effects on the news industry and public opinion.

But there are key institutional differences that change the calculus.

The freedom of speech is a constitutionally protected right in America, but not in the U.K. Even though social media platforms are private companies, the cultural respect of free speech is jealously guarded here, and that influences people's opinions on proper policy responses. Perhaps the cultural antibodies against violations of free speech are simply weaker in the U.K. Alternatively, perhaps Americans will misdirect our love of free speech into supporting public utility regulations on social media platforms that also violate the speech rights of social media platforms.

At the end of the day, media companies—vaunted though their profession may be in some circles—are still companies. And many of them are very big and very powerful. Some who call for social media oversight may truly have earnest motives. But surely all of them do not, and we should not allow the halo of ""the press"" to cloud our scrutiny of what may be simply an ugly business move.",www.reason.com,right,EyGh0Mh4D8M3pOHC

Accusations of bias are as old as the craft itself. Media watchdogs on the left and the right seek to hold journalists accountable.

But Trump's accusations are different. They suggest he sees no difference between the practice of journalism and the practice of politics.

Trump is reflecting a growing view on the right that journalists are nothing more than ""Democratic operatives with bylines,"" as conservative blogger Glenn Reynolds likes to say.

Rosen said the Trump supporters who adopt this point of view have essentially opted out of journalism.

Many journalists do, in fact, dislike Trump and resent the campaign's relentless media criticism. Some of them viscerally fear the candidate and the long term impact of his words. Critics charge that this antipathy bleeds into news coverage.

But individual opinions about Trump's campaign trail conduct are wholly different from an institutional conspiracy to elect Clinton.

Newsrooms are inherently competitive places, resistant to collaboration, even when it would benefit them. And news outlets are market driven: If many outlets all sound the same, there are business incentives to create alternatives.

But Trump doesn't acknowledge any of that.

Trump's attacks serve multiple purposes. By targeting the messenger, he is attempting to discredit the message and inoculate himself from an avalanche of critical news stories. He is also energizing the supporters who come to his rallies and cheer for him on social media.

Trump's media tirades have been met by chants of ""CNN sucks"" at rallies this week.

On ABC 's This Week with George Stephanopoulos , Van Susteren got into a debate with Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman over the effect that government regulation has on small businesses and the American job market . Though Krugman pointed out that Van Susteren 's assertion is not backed up by the data , Van Susteren refused to give his explanation credence .
VAN SUSTEREN : We 're strangling small businesses . I mean , you know everyone -- no one 's paying much attention to these small businesses . The regulations that are strangling them , some of them are laughable and silly , but they have a profound impact on the job creators , those who are making jobs . They ca n't afford to hire people . KRUGMAN : There 's been tons , there 's been tons of work on this . And what 's holding small business back is not regulations , it 's just the fact that they do n't have sales . VAN SUSTEREN : It 's not all , it 's some of it , some of it . KRUGMAN : It 's not . There 's no correlation , looking across , you know which parts of the economy do small businesses complain about regulations and which do n't they . There 's no correlation between that and actual job creation . [ Crosstalk ] GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS : Is there one exception perhaps , on the health care , where , firms that are greater than 50 people , have to pay more and that do n't you see some firms cutting off at 49 ? KRUGMAN : You really -- there might be . but you ca n't see that in the numbers . The overwhelming fact of the matter -- VAN SUSTEREN : Well If you talk to them , instead of looking at just the numbers , why do n't you sit down and talk to these people , lot of them are struggling with this . They do n't understand a lot of those things that happen . They do n't understand a lot of the things that are happening in Washington . They 're very cautious because they see a real dismal economy out there . And that does n't -- KRUGMAN : If you actually talk to them , that 's not what they say .
Despite Van Susteren 's claims , Krugman 's position has a strong foundation in official economic data as well as less formal anecdotes and survey responses from business owners .
Investment data refutes Susteren 's claim that high regulatory environments tend to suppress growth . An Economic Policy Institute ( EPI ) analysis of the past four economic recoveries found that the slowest growth actually occurred during the deregulatory Bush administration :
EPI research attributes slow economic growth to lagging demand , rather than high regulation :
Instead of uncertainty about regulations , there is strong evidence that the absence of job creation reflects the continued unwinding of the financial collapse and the corresponding lack of demand . Firm investments and hiring are lower because they have ample capacity to produce the goods and services they are selling to a shrunken market , while firms are deleveraging at the same time . One can easily document ( using National Income and Products Accounts ( NIPA ) Table 1.4.6 on GDP and mixing with population information from NIPA Table 2.1 ) that the final per person demand for domestically produced goods and service in the spring of 2011 ( second quarter ) was still 0.7 percent lower than it was before the recession , i.e. , the last quarter of 2007 ( U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis 2011a and 2011b ) . Assuming that demand per person would have grown , absent the downturn , at a 1.5 percent rate for three-and-a-half years ( a rate 20 percent lower than that of the 1979-2007 period ) , we find ourselves with demand 8.5 percent lower than we would expect .
Government data and analysis also support economists ' case that slack demand is what 's hurting small businesses , not regulations . In fact , government regulations have had a miniscule impact on employment rates in recent months , causing just 0.42 % of nonfarm mass layoffs in the final quarter of 2012 , according to Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ) data . The primary causes for such layoffs that quarter were completion of seasonal work ( 44 percent ) and business demand ( 32 percent ) . A BLS graph shows the discrepancy between demand and governmental regulations as a cause of layoffs . Here , government regulation is a subset of the bar labeled “ Production specific ” :
The Office Of Management and Budget ( OMB ) prepares an annual analysis of the costs and benefits of major government regulations for Congress . The 2012 draft report estimated that the benefits of major regulations ( $ 141- $ 700 billion ) would dramatically outpace their costs ( $ 43.3- $ 63.3 billion ) . The draft also included a comparison of approximate costs and benefits since 2002 :
This data is in keeping with the consensus view among economists , as reported in 2011 stories in The Washington Post , The Wall Street Journal , and Pro Publica .

media_bias,Politico,0,http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/facebook-fake-news-fact-checkers-232444,Fact checkers to Facebook: Fight fake news,2016-12-11,"Nancy Scola, Elana Schor, Brent Griffiths, Bryan Bender","The country 's most prominent fact checkers fought a losing battle against the flood of fake news during the presidential campaign . Now , they say , they have one great hope for preventing an even greater wave of propaganda masquerading as news : Facebook .
Fact checkers say they need the social network in their corner as Donald Trump , a frequent purveyor of misinformation himself , prepares to inherit the White House — and , with it , the world 's biggest megaphone .
Facebook has come under withering criticism for allowing the dissemination of egregiously fake stories during the campaign , with widely shared headlines falsely reporting that Pope Francis had endorsed Trump ’ s candidacy and that an FBI agent involved in the Hillary Clinton email investigation was dead in a murder-suicide . CEO Mark Zuckerberg , after first scoffing that fake news helped swing the election to Trump , has pledged to “ take misinformation seriously , '' though he gave no timeline for action and warned about the dangers of his company becoming an arbiter of the truth .
But fact-check organizations — which diligently reported lies and exaggerations during the campaign , only to see their work overshadowed by false headlines — argue that only Facebook has the reach and influence to address the free flow of fake news . And they are pushing the company to make changes now , as the weeks tick down to Trump 's inauguration .
`` Facebook has completely turbo-powered fake news sites , '' says Alexios Mantzarlis , director and editor of the Poynter Institute 's International Fact-Checking Network . `` But it 's also probably the first platform that could measure how these things spread , and how we could push back . ''
Shortly after Election Day , the `` Big Three '' in American fact checking — PolitiFact , a project of the Tampa Bay Times ; FactCheck.org , part of the University of Pennsylvania 's Annenberg Public Policy Center ; and the Washington Post 's Fact Checker — posted an letter to Zuckerberg calling on him to `` start an open conversation on the principles that could underpin a more accurate news ecosystem on its News Feed . ''
Now fact checkers are getting down to specifics about how Facebook should tackle blatantly fraudulent news .
Fact checkers say they need the social network in their corner as Donald Trump , a frequent purveyor of misinformation himself , prepares to inherit the White House . | Getty
To start , the social network should start removing the most popular false stories from the `` News Feed '' that fills users ' home screens on the site , says Mantzarlis . He argues that kind of filtering would have far-reaching effects , because some of the most popular pure hoaxes are reposted and clicked on hundreds of thousands of times , sometimes circulating for years .
`` Let 's not underestimate how important it is to act on the biggest fakes , '' Matzarlis says .
To identify those stories , Facebook could rely on the human curators who — despite headlines saying Facebook had gone to a completely automated system — still keep an eye on the company-produced `` Trending '' box on the site , he says . `` If something 's been demonstrated to be inaccurate '' by the trending team , `` then yank it out of News Feed , '' he says , adding such stories could still appear on people 's individual pages but be marked with `` a big red badge '' as fake .
Another option , says Eugene Kiely , director of FactCheck.org , is to pair fake stories with prominent fact checks , just as many websites today attach `` Related Stories '' to a particular headline .
`` I 'm concerned about how you go about removing material from these social media sites , because I think it 's kind of a dangerous area to get into , '' says Kiely . `` But if there 's an article about [ first lady Michelle Obama 's mother ] Marian Robinson getting a pension for watching her grandchildren in the White House for eight years , there 'd be a related item item right underneath it saying , 'No , grandma 's not getting a pension . ' ''
Zuckerberg initially responded to criticism by saying it 's a `` pretty crazy idea '' that fake news on the social network had an impact on the election . But in a follow-up post on the topic , he outlined a series of projects the company has underway to deal with fake news , including building better technical systems to detect false stories and `` disrupting fake news economics '' by cutting off ad revenue .
“ We take misinformation very seriously . We are aware of and have been working on addressing this problem for the past few years , '' a Facebook spokeswoman said when asked for comment . `` We know we have more work to do and we ’ re hoping we can continue to rely on our community to help us understand what is and is not fake news . ”
The fake news issue has shown no signs of dissipating since the election . Trump has himself helped to disseminate evidence-free claims , including a tweet claiming that he `` won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally . ''
It 's also become frighteningly real in Washington . Last weekend , a man fired a gun inside an upper northwest Washington , D.C. , pizza place targeted by a false story spread on social media about an alleged Democratic pedophilia ring there , a tale that Michael G. Flynn , the son of Trump 's pick for national security adviser , lent credence to via Twitter . The gunman told police he `` wanted to see for himself '' if the restaurant was `` harboring child sex slaves '' — although he acknowledged in a jailhouse interview with The New York Times that “ the intel on this wasn ’ t 100 percent . ”
Against that backdrop , the fact checkers are pressing Facebook to take concrete steps to identify and weed out hoaxes .
View Clinton decries fake news 'epidemic ' Hillary Clinton talks about news on Thursday .
The social network could do a better job enlisting its millions of U.S. users to flag false stories , Mantzarlis said . The site 's option for reporting `` purposefully fake or deceitful news '' — via a drop-down menu tucked in the upper right corner of every post — is awkward , he said , and does n't allow people to provide links that prove stories are false : `` On a platform where every engagement is very pleasant , almost addictive , the reporting process feels like something out of Windows 98 . ''

''","The country's most prominent fact checkers fought a losing battle against the flood of fake news during the presidential campaign. Now, they say, they have one great hope for preventing an even greater wave of propaganda masquerading as news: Facebook.

Fact checkers say they need the social network in their corner as Donald Trump, a frequent purveyor of misinformation himself, prepares to inherit the White House — and, with it, the world's biggest megaphone.

Story Continued Below

Facebook has come under withering criticism for allowing the dissemination of egregiously fake stories during the campaign, with widely shared headlines falsely reporting that Pope Francis had endorsed Trump’s candidacy and that an FBI agent involved in the Hillary Clinton email investigation was dead in a murder-suicide. CEO Mark Zuckerberg, after first scoffing that fake news helped swing the election to Trump, has pledged to “take misinformation seriously,"" though he gave no timeline for action and warned about the dangers of his company becoming an arbiter of the truth.

But fact-check organizations — which diligently reported lies and exaggerations during the campaign, only to see their work overshadowed by false headlines — argue that only Facebook has the reach and influence to address the free flow of fake news. And they are pushing the company to make changes now, as the weeks tick down to Trump's inauguration.

""Facebook has completely turbo-powered fake news sites,"" says Alexios Mantzarlis, director and editor of the Poynter Institute's International Fact-Checking Network. ""But it's also probably the first platform that could measure how these things spread, and how we could push back.""

Shortly after Election Day, the ""Big Three"" in American fact checking — PolitiFact, a project of the Tampa Bay Times; FactCheck.org, part of the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg Public Policy Center; and the Washington Post's Fact Checker — posted an letter to Zuckerberg calling on him to ""start an open conversation on the principles that could underpin a more accurate news ecosystem on its News Feed.""

Now fact checkers are getting down to specifics about how Facebook should tackle blatantly fraudulent news.

To start, the social network should start removing the most popular false stories from the ""News Feed"" that fills users' home screens on the site, says Mantzarlis. He argues that kind of filtering would have far-reaching effects, because some of the most popular pure hoaxes are reposted and clicked on hundreds of thousands of times, sometimes circulating for years.

""Let's not underestimate how important it is to act on the biggest fakes,"" Matzarlis says.

To identify those stories, Facebook could rely on the human curators who — despite headlines saying Facebook had gone to a completely automated system — still keep an eye on the company-produced ""Trending"" box on the site, he says. ""If something's been demonstrated to be inaccurate"" by the trending team, ""then yank it out of News Feed,"" he says, adding such stories could still appear on people's individual pages but be marked with ""a big red badge"" as fake.

Another option, says Eugene Kiely, director of FactCheck.org, is to pair fake stories with prominent fact checks, just as many websites today attach ""Related Stories"" to a particular headline.

""I'm concerned about how you go about removing material from these social media sites, because I think it's kind of a dangerous area to get into,"" says Kiely. ""But if there's an article about [first lady Michelle Obama's mother] Marian Robinson getting a pension for watching her grandchildren in the White House for eight years, there'd be a related item item right underneath it saying, 'No, grandma's not getting a pension.'""

Zuckerberg initially responded to criticism by saying it's a ""pretty crazy idea"" that fake news on the social network had an impact on the election. But in a follow-up post on the topic, he outlined a series of projects the company has underway to deal with fake news, including building better technical systems to detect false stories and ""disrupting fake news economics"" by cutting off ad revenue.

“We take misinformation very seriously. We are aware of and have been working on addressing this problem for the past few years,"" a Facebook spokeswoman said when asked for comment. ""We know we have more work to do and we’re hoping we can continue to rely on our community to help us understand what is and is not fake news.”

The fake news issue has shown no signs of dissipating since the election. Trump has himself helped to disseminate evidence-free claims, including a tweet claiming that he ""won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.""

It's also become frighteningly real in Washington. Last weekend, a man fired a gun inside an upper northwest Washington, D.C., pizza place targeted by a false story spread on social media about an alleged Democratic pedophilia ring there, a tale that Michael G. Flynn, the son of Trump's pick for national security adviser, lent credence to via Twitter. The gunman told police he ""wanted to see for himself"" if the restaurant was ""harboring child sex slaves"" — although he acknowledged in a jailhouse interview with The New York Times that “the intel on this wasn’t 100 percent.”

Against that backdrop, the fact checkers are pressing Facebook to take concrete steps to identify and weed out hoaxes.

View Clinton decries fake news 'epidemic' Hillary Clinton talks about news on Thursday.

The social network could do a better job enlisting its millions of U.S. users to flag false stories, Mantzarlis said. The site's option for reporting ""purposefully fake or deceitful news"" — via a drop-down menu tucked in the upper right corner of every post — is awkward, he said, and doesn't allow people to provide links that prove stories are false: ""On a platform where every engagement is very pleasant, almost addictive, the reporting process feels like something out of Windows 98.""

Another idea is to make the names of news sources larger and more visible on Facebook posts. At the moment, publication titles are tucked away under posts in a tiny gray font, obscuring the fact that false headlines may be coming from familiar-sounding but fringe publications like ""ABCNews.com.co"" and the ""Denver Guardian."" Fact checkers are also calling on Facebook to share more data on which fake news stories are trafficking especially well on the social network, so that they can focus their efforts.

Among the anti-misinformation projects the company has underway, wrote the CEO, is ""easy reporting"" of fake news.

And as the bureau ’ s new probe of Clinton ’ s email mess has transformed the media and political environment , there ’ s been a sharp shift in the coverage over the last few days . The reporting and analysis is now far more skeptical toward James Comey than when the story erupted on Friday afternoon .
That ’ s been coupled with a frantic reassessment—and plenty of confusion—of whether the new investigation is indeed shaking up the race . The tentative conventional wisdom : not so much .
As an old Justice Department reporter , I can tell you that I ’ ve never seen anything like the torrent of leaks coming out of the FBI and DOJ . And that reflects dissension within the department and the bureau over how this should have been handled .
Comey went public despite his own agents not knowing what is in the many thousands of emails found on Anthony Weiner ’ s laptop , according to sources cited by the media . His laptop appears to have been backing up data from his wife Huma Abedin ’ s phone , according to sources cited by the media . Comey sent his letter to the Hill over the objections of Attorney General Loretta Lynch , who felt he should stick with department guidelines and not comment on a criminal probe so close to the election , according to sources cited by the media .
But Comey also worried that he would like he was part of a coverup if the new email trove turned out to be significant after Clinton was elected—again , according to sources cited by the media .
Add to this leak-a-thon the assault on Comey by Clinton , her team and her allies : while Nancy Pelosi called Comey a “ great man ” in July , Harry Reid now says he may have violated the Hatch Act . And that has generated lots of headlines .
A New York Times news story today likens Comey ( fairly or unfairly , it says ) to J. Edgar Hoover .
And then there are the op-ed wars . Not surprisingly , former Obama attorney general Eric Holder rips his former colleague in the Washington Post :
“ Director Comey broke with these fundamental principles . I fear he has unintentionally and negatively affected public trust in both the Justice Department and the FBI . ”
“ How rich of Hillary Clinton to complain now that FBI director James Comey is threatening the democratic process by commenting publicly about a criminal investigation on the eve of an election . Put aside that Comey did not say a single thing last week that implicates Clinton in a crime . The biggest coup for Clinton in the waning months of the campaign has been Comey ’ s decision not to prosecute her — a decision outside the responsibilities of the FBI director and publicly announced in a manner that contradicts law-enforcement protocols…
“ Now , suddenly , Mrs. Clinton is worried about law-enforcement interference in politics…
“ Law-enforcement people will tell you that taking action too close to Election Day can affect the outcome of the vote ; therefore , it should not be done because law enforcement is supposed to be apolitical . But of course , not taking action one would take but for the political timing is as political as it gets . ”
But even with the more critical coverage , the FBI investigation is still diverting the spotlight of whatever else Clinton wants to talk about .
And yes , I know that Bill Clinton pounced on George H.W . Bush days before the 1992 election when special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh brought an indictment against his former Pentagon chief Caspar Weinberger , which was later tossed out . This isn ’ t the first time politics has tainted the end of a campaign .
So how is the Comey controversy affecting the campaign , now that we ’ re a week out ?
A New York Times news story says “ the race is still exceedingly close . ”
But the Times Upshot blog gives Clinton a 90 percent chance of winning , which is not exactly close .
“ Hillary Clinton has established a slim edge over Donald J. Trump in early-voter turnout in several vital swing states , pressing her longstanding advantages in state-level organization and potentially mitigating the fallout from her campaign ’ s latest scrap with the F.B.I . ”
The Washington Post ’ s Fix blog has a ray of hope for the Republican nominee : “ Donald Trump has a path to victory again thanks to Florida . ”
But despite polls showing Trump ahead or virtually tied in Florida , the column says : “ There 's been some movement toward Donald Trump in both national and swing state polling over the past week . Trump 's problem is that , at least as of today , it 's just not enough . ”
“ The first national polls taken in the immediate aftermath of the election ’ s latest October surprise suggest it ’ s having a limited impact on the presidential polls so far . But there are a few swing states where the bombshell letter FBI Director James Comey sent to Congress Friday could still have a disproportionate effect . ”
One more set of numbers , from an ABC/Post poll : While 63 percent of those surveyed say the FBI review makes no difference to them , 34 percent say it makes them less likely to vote for Clinton—but those are “ disproportionately ” Republicans and GOP-leaning independents .
I think all this hurts Hillary at the margins , at the very least by knocking her off stride , and convincing Trump supporters that he can win as he goes to such solid Democratic states as Michigan , Wisconsin and Pennsylvania to try to expand his path to 270 .
If what Jim Comey has done is deeply troubling to you , you probably weren ’ t voting for Clinton anyway . If you ’ re dismissing Comey ’ s move , you were probably already in Clinton ’ s column . But the uproar does foster a sense , which clearly helps Trump , that this thing ain ’ t over .","Remember when we used to talk about whether Hillary Clinton would win the FBI primary?

“Law-enforcement people will tell you that taking action too close to Election Day can affect the outcome of the vote; therefore, it should not be done because law enforcement is supposed to be apolitical. But of course, not taking action one would take but for the political timing is as political as it gets.”

But even with the more critical coverage, the FBI investigation is still diverting the spotlight of whatever else Clinton wants to talk about.

And yes, I know that Bill Clinton pounced on George H.W. Bush days before the 1992 election when special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh brought an indictment against his former Pentagon chief Caspar Weinberger, which was later tossed out. This isn’t the first time politics has tainted the end of a campaign.

So how is the Comey controversy affecting the campaign, now that we’re a week out?

A New York Times news story says “the race is still exceedingly close.”

But the Times Upshot blog gives Clinton a 90 percent chance of winning, which is not exactly close.

The news story is more nuanced:

“Hillary Clinton has established a slim edge over Donald J. Trump in early-voter turnout in several vital swing states, pressing her longstanding advantages in state-level organization and potentially mitigating the fallout from her campaign’s latest scrap with the F.B.I.”

The Washington Post’s Fix blog has a ray of hope for the Republican nominee: “Donald Trump has a path to victory again thanks to Florida.”

But despite polls showing Trump ahead or virtually tied in Florida, the column says: “There's been some movement toward Donald Trump in both national and swing state polling over the past week. Trump's problem is that, at least as of today, it's just not enough.”

Politico also hedges its bets:

“The first national polls taken in the immediate aftermath of the election’s latest October surprise suggest it’s having a limited impact on the presidential polls so far. But there are a few swing states where the bombshell letter FBI Director James Comey sent to Congress Friday could still have a disproportionate effect.”

One more set of numbers, from an ABC/Post poll: While 63 percent of those surveyed say the FBI review makes no difference to them, 34 percent say it makes them less likely to vote for Clinton—but those are “disproportionately” Republicans and GOP-leaning independents.

I think all this hurts Hillary at the margins, at the very least by knocking her off stride, and convincing Trump supporters that he can win as he goes to such solid Democratic states as Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania to try to expand his path to 270.

If what Jim Comey has done is deeply troubling to you, you probably weren’t voting for Clinton anyway. If you’re dismissing Comey’s move, you were probably already in Clinton’s column. But the uproar does foster a sense, which clearly helps Trump, that this thing ain’t over.",www.foxnews.com,right,6gQoH1bGQl37gb67

In the footage , which is O'Reilly 's own report for CBS News from the violent incident in question , the Fox News host makes no mention of anyone dying and describes police using “ tear gas , ” not live ammunition .
On February 19 , Mother Jones wrote that O'Reilly had never reported from “ a war zone , in Argentina , in the Falklands ” as he 's said in the past . O'Reilly responded by claiming that when he had said he reported from a “ war zone , ” he was specifically describing a 1982 Buenos Aires protest which broke out after Argentina surrendered in the War .
O'Reilly has frequently hyped the violence at that protest to emphasize his own reporting bona fides , going so far as to call it a `` combat situation . '' For example , O'Reilly claimed in a 2009 interview that during the riot the army shot at protesters with “ real bullets , ” not “ tear gas ” :
When the riots broke out in the Casa Rosada ... the army was standing between the people and the presidential palace . Here in the United States , we would do tear gas and rubber bullets . They were doing real bullets . They were just gunning these people down , shooting them down in the streets .
In his book The No Spin Zone , O'Reilly also described the protest , writing “ A major riot ensued and many were killed. ” And on his now-defunct radio show , O'Reilly claimed :
I was in the middle of that riot when Argentine soldiers came out of the barracks and got into the streets and actually shot people dead in the street , because people were rioting . And it was n't like warning shots or rubber bullets or teargas . They were shooting people dead .
Many of O'Reilly 's former colleagues who reported from the same protest , as well as reporters from other outlets and an Argentine historian , have contradicted his claim that there were fatalities .
Mother Jones has since unearthed O'Reilly 's own report from the scene , which makes no mention of live ammunition or deaths .

According to Mother Jones , O'Reilly 's report aired on local CBS affiliates at the time .

“ ‘ Donald Trump ’ s the smart one — and y ’ all elitists are dumb ! ’ ” Wilson said in a heavy , stereotypical southern accent .
Then , the other guest ( CNN contributor Wajahat Ali ) chimed in , saying : “ ‘ You elitists with your geography and your maps — and your spelling ! ’ ”
“ ‘ Your math and your reading ! ’ ” Wilson added . “ ‘ All those lines on the map ! ’ ”
By Tuesday night , Lemon was receiving considerable backlash over the clip — prompting him to address the controversy on his show :
Ask anyone who knows me , they ’ ll tell you — I don ’ t believe in belittling people , belittling anyone for who they are , what they believe . During an interview on Saturday night , one of my guests said something that made me laugh . And while in the moment , I found that joke humorous . And I didn ’ t catch everything that was said .
“ Just to make it perfectly clear , ” he added . “ I was laughing at the joke and not at any group of people . ”
( Notice that Lemon stopped short of actually apologizing for his behavior . )
First of all , it seems pretty clear to me that Lemon ’ s defense ( that he simply “ didn ’ t catch ” everything the panelists were saying ) is a blatant lie . He is laughing , consistently , while the guests are making their jokes , and then continuing to laugh after the guests make them . You don ’ t need to be a human-behavior expert to understand that , when someone is laughing during and after a joke , then the laughter is because of that joke .
Lemon knew exactly what he was laughing at — and , by refusing to apologize , he has made it clear that he doesn ’ t see anything wrong with that , either .
The thing is , though , he should regret it — for his own sake . After all , it ’ s clear that Lemon hates Trump , and his performance in that segment is going to be a way bigger help to the incumbent president than anything that Trump could ever do for himself .

If you don ’ t understand what I mean , just think about what happened after Hillary Clinton ’ s “ deplorables ” comment . Did that turn people away from Trump ? Far from it . In fact , it prompted countless Trump supporters to use the word in their names or handles on Twitter . It prompted the Trump campaign to sell “ deplorable ” T-shirts . It prompted Trump to use the comments for his own campaign ’ s fundraising , and to bring his supporters closer to him , as well as to present himself as the foil who would never demean them in that way . ( “ While my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable , I call you hardworking American patriots who love your country and want a better future for all of our people , ” Trump said during a rally in Iowa shortly afterwards . )
In other words ? Rather than question their choice of alliance because of Clinton ’ s insult , Trump ’ s supporters embraced it — clearly seeing it as evidence that the people who disagree with them , in fact , don ’ t just disagree with them ; they hate them , too . They think that they ’ re stupid . Nobody wants to listen to anyone who just got done calling them dumb , and all Lemon did here was further solidify the narrative that “ liberal media elites ” like him think Trump supporters are fools , which , in turn , only makes them hate Trump ’ s opposition more .
What ’ s more , in Lemon ’ s instance , his guests ’ usage of stereotypical Southern accents — clearly intended to signify “ stupidity ” — could extend the consequences of this particular blunder to include turning off those voters in rural areas who are on the fence politically . Trump can point directly to this segment as evidence whenever he makes one of his favorite claims : that his opponents don ’ t respect his supporters or rural Americans .
In fact , this clip actually also provides ammunition for another one of Trump ’ s favorite claims : the idea that CNN is “ Fake News. ” Looking at this clip — and seeing a CNN news anchor laughing at Trump supporters this way — makes it easier for Trump to tell his supporters that all the news coming from CNN is tainted with this same bias , and therefore not reliable . It makes it more likely that they will blindly believe Trump , who hasn ’ t insulted them , and less likely that they will believe that anyone affiliated with CNN could ever have a legitimate criticism .
Lemon , I ’ m guessing , didn ’ t expect that any Trump supporters would ever see this clip of him laughing at them — but , unfortunately for him , millions of them did . If he doesn ’ t want to apologize to the people he insulted , then that is perfectly fine . He might , however , want to consider apologizing to the people who are going to actually be hurt by it the most : the people who want Trump out of office , and the network he represents .","CNN television news anchor Don Lemon (Mike Segar/Reuters)

It all started after one guest, ex-GOP strategist Rick Wilson, joked that Trump would be too stupid to find Ukraine on a map, before calling Trump’s supporters the “credulous boomer rube demo.”

Lemon laughed heartily, and so Wilson continued his mocking:

“‘Donald Trump’s the smart one — and y’all elitists are dumb!’” Wilson said in a heavy, stereotypical southern accent.

Then, the other guest (CNN contributor Wajahat Ali) chimed in, saying: “‘You elitists with your geography and your maps — and your spelling!’”

Trump can point directly to this segment as evidence whenever he makes one of his favorite claims: that his opponents don’t respect his supporters or rural Americans.

In fact, this clip actually also provides ammunition for another one of Trump’s favorite claims: the idea that CNN is “Fake News.” Looking at this clip — and seeing a CNN news anchor laughing at Trump supporters this way — makes it easier for Trump to tell his supporters that all the news coming from CNN is tainted with this same bias, and therefore not reliable. It makes it more likely that they will blindly believe Trump, who hasn’t insulted them, and less likely that they will believe that anyone affiliated with CNN could ever have a legitimate criticism.

Lemon, I’m guessing, didn’t expect that any Trump supporters would ever see this clip of him laughing at them — but, unfortunately for him, millions of them did. If he doesn’t want to apologize to the people he insulted, then that is perfectly fine. He might, however, want to consider apologizing to the people who are going to actually be hurt by it the most: the people who want Trump out of office, and the network he represents.",www.nationalreview.com,right,t4X312K5Y3mu8lxV

Breaking news: Some guy posted a doctored video of Nancy Pelosi.

But fear not. The website the Daily Beast sprang into action. It tracked down the random, Trump-supporting man who allegedly posted the offending clip, hounded him until he talked, then published his name and other details about his life in a shocking instance of harassment masquerading as journalism.

The man whose identity was revealed by the Daily Beast is, by the publication’s account, an unemployed African-American forklift operator who lives in New York City and runs a couple of very minor Facebook pages.

It got several million views and was, stupidly, shared by Rudy Giuliani on Twitter. The video was certainly a testament to the debased quality of online discourse, but it was also quickly identified as a fake, because it was pretty obviously a fake.

None of this justifies outing the man supposedly responsible for it. In a better world, anonymous political commentators could be identified without fear of social media mobs attempting to ruin their lives. As has been demonstrated time and again, this is not the world we live in.

Widely criticized for its decision to name the man — or in online parlance, “dox” him — the Daily Beast defended its story as a way to show “that disinformation isn’t the purview of Russia alone.” But who ever believed this?

The Left is so obsessed with the idea that Russia, after its desultory social-media campaign in 2016, pulls the strings of our democracy that it assumes every noxious piece of content on the Internet might have been cooked up in a Russian troll farm.

All of this was completely gratuitous. The balance, which any responsible publication should have considered, between the public benefit of naming the man (none) and the personal harm that might be done by naming him (considerable) isn’t even close.

Of course, it matters that he is a Trump supporter. Outlets like the Daily Beast don’t make a routine practice of hunting down trolls who are producing the vast sea of anti-Trump material online, because they don’t consider spoofing or maligning Trump to be a threat to democracy or at all undesirable.

Incredibly enough, according to the Daily Beast, someone at Facebook provided details about the man’s posting history that were used to confirm the story. Users of Facebook should take note: Menlo Park is monitoring you and can and will participate with reporters in your doxing, as deemed necessary.

Although reporters with the historical memory of gnats might believe that rank abuse of America’s high elected officials is something new, it’s as old as the republic. And it’s often been anonymous. By all means, call out online distortions and lies, but deliberately exposing low-level political advocates to personal destruction is shabby and irresponsible, and more an act of political retaliation than journalism.

Interviewers have not been able to resist the urge to talk about Stewart ’ s thoughts on the midterm elections , on immigration , and on the legacy of Obama . But what has been really interesting to watch is Stewart ’ s comments on Fox News and on commentators like Sean Hannity and Bill O ’ Reilly .
In a recent interview with Rolling Stone , Stewart explained that most of Fox News is about fear . Fox News viewers , he explained , operate in a world where they have a high sense of being persecuted , and this is why , for instance , we will soon see pieces on the “ War on Christmas ” with commentators standing next to 60-foot-tall Christmas trees .

Meanwhile on Fox News it is common to see pundits attack major segments of our society while misinforming their viewers .
Evidence of these tactics was in place in the Nov. 14 interview between Stewart and O ’ Reilly on “ The O ’ Reilly Factor. ” O ’ Reilly began the interview introducing Stewart as a “ big-time liberal commentator ” and focusing on the midterm elections . He asked Stewart to explain why the Democrats lost and Stewart responded with a very non-partisan answer : “ Because they curled up in a little ball and tried to make sure that nobody hit them . I have no idea what they even ran on. ” But Stewart ’ s answer wasn ’ t what O ’ Reilly wanted to hear . So he offered his own analysis : The Democrats lost “ because the callow youth that watches your program didn ’ t show up , ” he said to Stewart .
Callow youth ? First of all , all the data suggests that the millennials , the main demographic for Stewart 's show , did show up . At 21.3 percent they voted at the same percentage as last midterm . And this despite the very real challenges they have to actually casting votes . These young people juggle jobs and classes that make finding the time to get to the voting booths a real challenge . Add to that the voter ID regulations and lack of early voting options designed to suppress their vote .
Second of all , it is hard to understand how O ’ Reilly can refer to Stewart ’ s young viewers as callow stoners when they also volunteer at a higher rate than boomers .

In contrast , the satirical comedians like Stewart , Stephen Colbert and John Oliver have been proven to accurately inform their audiences even though they are not news shows .
And despite the hype , it is not Stewart , Colbert and Oliver who are stirring up the partisan spin . Sure they attack Fox News , sure they call out the outrageous positions of many Republicans , but they go after the Democrats too . Stewart ’ s post midterm election coverage included a bit called “ Obama and the Pussycrats. ” That ’ s far from subtle .

Many conservatives have naturally been critical of the political and policy stances of the Parkland survivors , as would be expected given that they generally oppose gun control .

Conservatives have attacked March for Our Lives organizers in a personal way
Here are some examples of other false , bizarre , and personal conservative attacks on March for Our Lives leaders :
Right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones , the host of Infowars , has pushed conspiracy theories that the March for Our Lives organizers are “ being funded ” and “ given scripts ” — insinuating that they ’ re actors .
Conservative documentarian and noted troll Dinesh D ’ Souza tweeted in February , “ How interesting to hear students who can ’ t support themselves for one day giving us lectures about American social policy . ”
The campaign of Rep. Steve King ( R-IA ) , who has a history of racism , posted a meme on his Facebook page mocking March for Our Lives organizer Emma Gonzalez for her Cuban heritage . The meme stated , “ This is how you look when you claim Cuban heritage yet don ’ t speak Spanish and ignore the fact that your ancestors fled the island when the dictatorship turned Cuba into a prison camp , after removing all weapons from its citizens ; hence their right to self defense . ”
On Twitter , conservative figures , including actor Adam Baldwin , have shared fake images of Gonzalez tearing up the US Constitution . In the real image , she was tearing up a gun target .
The conservative outlet Breitbart rounded up tweets that falsely suggested Hogg performed a Nazi salute during the March for Our Lives in Washington , DC .
Infowars ’ Jones also put out a video of Hogg ’ s March for Our Lives speech dubbed with an Adolf Hitler speech , and a separate video that depicted Gonzalez as a member of the Hitler Youth .

Leslie Gibson , a Republican candidate for the Maine state House , called Gonzalez a “ skinhead lesbian ” and Hogg a “ moron ” and a “ baldfaced liar. ” The comments drew so much criticism that he dropped out of the race .
Rick Santorum , a former Republican senator from Pennsylvania , argued that instead of advocating for gun control , Parkland survivors should take personal responsibility for preventing deadly shooters — and learn CPR : “ How about kids instead of looking to someone else to solve their problem , do something about maybe taking CPR classes or trying to deal with situations that when there is a violent shooter that you can actually respond to that. ” Santorum later said he misspoke .
Several conservative outlets falsely suggested that Gonzalez admitted to bullying the Parkland shooter . This is part of a broader victim-blaming campaign : It has become a common talking point to insinuate that the shooter only carried out the attack because he was socially isolated , so students should have tried to befriend him to prevent the shooting .

Since March 25 , those networks either completely ignored or barely mentioned the scandal , even after Reade 's story was significantly bolstered Friday after the Media Research Center unearthed and posted an August 1993 video clip of Reade 's mother calling CNN about her daughter 's problem with a `` prominent senator . ''
Even the liberal New York Times and Washington Post have published lengthy stories investigating the charges ( on April 13 ) , yet ABC and NBC have n't spent even a single second on the story . CBS has devoted a paltry 63 seconds , while PBS gave it a mere seven minutes . The all-day news networks CNN and MSNBC should have posted significantly higher totals , but they have n't : MSNBC managed only four and a half minutes in mid-April , while CNN only ended its complete blackout after we posted their own video from 1993 , which validated a key claim from Reade .
It 's not as if they have n't had time to promote Joe Biden 's presidential campaign : During this time , ABC , NBC , CNN and MSNBC all invited Biden on their airwaves for interviews , but they refused to confront him even once about these allegations . Out of 77 questions , not a single one asked the former Senator and Vice President about Reade 's charges .
On Friday afternoon , The Intercept website reported that Reade ’ s mother called into CNN ’ s Larry King Live on August 11 , 1993 to ask for advice on how to deal with the situation . Journalist Ryan Grim quoted Reade as telling him : “ I remember it being an anonymous call. ” This call did take place , and the Media Research Center on Friday provided video evidence of it .
Despite the new revelation , ABC and NBC have still refused to cover the story . CNN , which had been conducting a similar blackout , finally gave in and reported on it Saturday .
MRC analysts examined the amount of coverage of the Reade allegations on broadcast networks ABC , CBS , NBC , PBS and cable outlets CNN and MSNBC . They also counted the total number of interview questions to Biden on those networks between March 25 ( the day the allegations went public ) and April 27 . ( The study includes the morning and evening newscasts and cable coverage . For a breakdown of what was included , see the note at the end of this article . )
In addition to not forcing Biden to respond to the claims , ABC and NBC completely boycotted the story . CNN went from zero coverage for 31 days ( CNN.com posted online only stories ) to 14 minutes and 54 seconds on Saturday . Reporter M.J. Lee ridiculously told Wolf Blitzer that Reade had only “ recently ” accused Biden . ( Again , it was March 25 . ) Showcasing how late CNN was to all this , Lee on Saturday admitted that the network “ interviewed Reade for the first time on the phone last night . ”
CBS mentioned Reade once on April 16 during CBS This Morning . In an interview with former Democratic contender Bernie Sanders , co-host Tony Dokoupil managed a scant 1 minute and 3 seconds . CBS did not return to the story after the most recent developments .
In a one-month period , the liberal MSNBC offered a paltry 4 minutes and 39 seconds . Despite the newest revelations involving Reade ’ s mother , the network has not returned to the story . For instance , with three hours of available airtime on Monday , Morning Joe skipped it entirely . Yet PBS , with just a couple news shows ( NewsHour and Amanpour and Co. ) beat MSNBC ’ s . PBS managed a total of 7 minutes and 5 seconds .
In just over a month , the grand total of ABC , CBS , NBC , PBS , CNN and MSNBC ’ s Reade coverage amounted to 27 minutes and 31 seconds , as of April 27 . However , 14 minutes and 54 seconds of that came from CNN on April 25 .
As for actual Joe Biden interviews , both networks and cable channels repeatedly passed up opportunities to simply ask if the accusations were true .
Meet the Press host Chuck Todd offered an example of the types of questions they asked ( instead of forcing Biden to respond to the assault allegations ) . On March 29 , Todd said of Trump ’ s response to coronavirus : “ Do you think there is blood on the President ’ s hands , considering the slow response ? ”
CNN had the most opportunities to ask Biden about Reade . The network had a town hall on March 27 . There were 23 questions total on a variety of non-sexual assault-related topics . On March 31 , Brooke Baldwin asked four questions to Biden . On April 16 , CNN hosted another town hall for an additional six questions . In total , the network asked 33 questions .
MSNBC also had three interview opportunities . On March 30 , MSNBC Live ’ s Katy Tur asked the former Vice President 9 questions . The next day , 11th Hour host Brian Williams offered another nine . On April 16 , Morning Joe added four more , bringing MSNBC ’ s total to 22 .
As for the networks , NBC asked Biden 16 questions . Nine of them on the March 29 Meet the Press and another seven on the April 7 Today 3rd Hour . ABC had a single interview on the April 5 This Week , amounting to six questions . ( CBS has not had a Biden interview since the accusation broke . ) Still no questions about Reade .
The lack of coverage became more embarrassing in mid-April . On April 13 , The New York Times published a front-page story . Writers Lisa Lerer and Sydney Ember described in graphic detail Reade ’ s allegation of how , in 1993 , Biden “ pinned her to a wall in a Senate building , reached under her clothing and penetrated her with his fingers. ” The Washington Post , also on April 13 , featured a front-page investigation .
These two outlets are prominent establishment newspapers . Yet , still nothing on ABC and NBC .
It ’ s not as though the late-night comedy shows ( which were not counted in this study ) were any better . For instance , Biden appeared on the April 21 edition of The Late Late Show With James Corden . The interview ran for a whopping 24 minutes . Number of questions on Reade ? Zero .
The contrast to media coverage for then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is stark . In addition to blanketing the airwaves with the accusations of Christine Blasey Ford , the networks virtually ignored any evidence that would exonerate the conservative nominee . MRC Research Director Rich Noyes wrote in September of 2018 :
During the twelve days since Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein publicly announced the existence of an unspecified allegation against Brett Kavanaugh , the ABC , CBS and NBC morning and evening news shows have spent nearly six hours ( 344 minutes ) regurgitating various unproved allegations against the Supreme Court nominee .
The mantra of the many in the # MeToo movement is to “ believe all women. ” Journalists , at the very least , should give a fair hearing to serious accusations against any major public figure .

At times , Clinton ’ s campaign staff not only internally drafted the stories they wanted published but even specified what should be quoted “ on background ” and what should be described as “ on the record. ” One January 2015 strategy document — designed to plant stories on Clinton ’ s decision-making process about whether to run for president — singled out reporter Maggie Haberman , then of Politico , now covering the election for the New York Times , as a “ friendly journalist ” who has “ teed up ” stories for them in the past and “ never disappointed ” them . Nick Merrill , the campaign press secretary , produced the memo , according to the document metadata :

The event was an April 10 cocktail party for leading news figures and top-level Clinton staff at the Upper East Side home of Clinton strategist Joel Benenson , a fully off-the-record gathering designed to impart the campaign ’ s messaging :
A separate email chain between Clinton staff ( one that was not among those provided by Guccifer 2.0 but appeared on the DCLeaks.com site earlier this week ) contains plans for a separate off-the-record media get-together in May . Food and drinks were provided by the campaign for the journalists covering it , on the condition that nothing said would be reported to the public . Many of the enduring Clinton tactics for managing the press were created by the campaign before she even announced her candidacy . A March 13 , 2015 , memo from Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook provides insight into some of the tactics employed by the campaign to shape coverage to their liking . In particular , Mook was concerned that because journalists were assigned to cover Clinton , they needed to be fed a constant stream of stories that the campaign liked .

One of the most elaborately planned get-togethers was described in an April, 2015, memo — produced, according to the document metadata, by deputy press secretary Jesse Ferguson — to take place shortly before Clinton’s official announcement of her candidacy. The event was an April 10 cocktail party for leading news figures and top-level Clinton staff at the Upper East Side home of Clinton strategist Joel Benenson, a fully off-the-record gathering designed to impart the campaign’s messaging:

A separate email chain between Clinton staff (one that was not among those provided by Guccifer 2.0 but appeared on the DCLeaks.com site earlier this week) contains plans for a separate off-the-record media get-together in May. Food and drinks were provided by the campaign for the journalists covering it, on the condition that nothing said would be reported to the public. Many of the enduring Clinton tactics for managing the press were created by the campaign before she even announced her candidacy. A March 13, 2015, memo from Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook provides insight into some of the tactics employed by the campaign to shape coverage to their liking. In particular, Mook was concerned that because journalists were assigned to cover Clinton, they needed to be fed a constant stream of stories that the campaign liked. As he put it, a key strategy was to “give reporters who must cover daily HRC news something to cover other than the unhelpful stories about the foundation, emails, etc.”",www.theintercept.com,left,dNiPwDg116PVEznO

The Washington Post is facing backlash after a headline characterized the Islamic State leader who was killed in a U.S. raid over the weekend as an ""austere religious scholar."" The headline was quickly changed, but critics say it sugar coated the terror inflicted by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

Mo Udall at an endless political dinner and conclude that , “ Everything that can be said about Brian Williams has been said ; it ’ s just that not everyone has said it yet . ”
Consider what follows as a few footnotes to the Big Stuff— “ Why did he do it ? ” “ How bad were his misdeeds ? ” “ Are there others ? ” “ Can he survive ? ” In the reactions to the story of the Flak Attack That Wasn ’ t lie some telling realities about today ’ s media world .
There Is No “ Wall of Silence. ” My Twitter feed was—and still is—filed with assertions that the mainstream media will circle the wagons to protect one of their own . This is precisely what has not happened . The New York Times has published accounts that cast serious doubt not only on Williams ’ s later storytelling , but also on the original NBC story 12 years ago . Maureen Dowd ’ s Sunday column is brutal , reporting concerns within NBC News of Williams ’ s tendency to aggrandize himself . In The New Yorker , satirist Andy Borowitz wrote an acidic “ diary ” painting the NBC anchor as the embodiment of upper-class privilege . The Washington Post , CNN , Slate and The ███—media outlets that would never be confused with right-wing zealotry—have been highly critical of Williams . Only a few familiar faces—Dan Rather and TIME ’ s Joe Klein—have spoken up in Williams ’ s defense .
You can argue that these outlets been “ forced ” into this because the digital world makes it impossible to ignore the depredations of traditional media . Or you can note that the media themselves have come to accept that they need to be subject to the same critical gaze as other institutions . Thus the birth of ombudsmen and public accountability—from The New York Times and Jayson Blair ’ s tall tales , to the Washington Post ’ s Janet Cooke and her eight-year-old addict , to CBS and the George W. Bush National Guard story , to CNN ’ s Tailwind scandal and beyond . Whatever the reason , the notion that the “ mainstream media ” has rushed to protect Brian Williams is laughable .
Williams Made Himself A Perfect Target . There ’ s no more attractive story than one suggesting that an important or powerful figure is a hypocrite . It ’ s the war hawk urging the dispatch of young men and women into harm ’ s way , but whose draft deferments or sketchy medical condition exempted him from the draft . It ’ s the liberal voting to bus children to school while sending her kids to private academies . It ’ s the tribune of moral virtue paying for abortions for the staff assistant he knocked up . It ’ s the environmentalists flying to a climate change rally in a private jet .
Brian Williams is , in this sense , a perfect fit . His inaccurate , or misleading , or deeply dishonest account of what happened in Iraq seems to put the lie to a career that has featured him in the midst of one danger or another . To be clear on this point : Williams in fact has been in many places where natural disasters or violence have indeed involved risk . ( I write as someone who , in more than 30 years of network TV reporting , found himself in physical danger exactly once , in South Africa , for a period of perhaps 15 minutes . )
But by steadily exaggerating the perils of his helicopter journey , he ’ s permitted critics to suggest that it was all an act ; that he is not who he wanted us to think he is . He ’ s also opened the door to those who scoff at the danger journalists face . On Thursday , Rush Limbaugh scornfully referred to journalists who “ put on a trench coat and stand in a street in Beirut. ” This is a slanderous smear on the critically wounded Bob Woodruff and Kimberly Dozier , on Mike Kelly and David Bloom ( who died in Iraq ) , on James Foley and other journalists beheaded by ISIS , on the 61 journalists killed in 2014 . It is , however , a slander that will resonate , and it will resonate because Williams was apparently unwilling to let his record , unvarnished , speak for itself .
Have You Looked In the Mirror Lately ? Brian Williams is one of many in the mainstream or traditional or legacy media who have warned about the difficulty of judging the credibility of “ new media. ” When a story is coming from somewhere “ out there , ” in the digital universe , with no imprimatur , where ’ s the institutional backup , where are the researchers , the editors , the fact-checkers , the accountability ?
Well , in this case , it was the toolbox of the “ new media ” that exposed the holes ( or lack of them ) in the helicopter story . Facebook gave a member of the U.S. military the forum on which to challenge Williams ( “ Sorry , dude , I do n't remember you being on my aircraft ” ) . Moreover , there are a lot of questions still to be answered about why the NBC staffers who were with Williams never raised their voices to say : “ Um Brian , about that story… ”
As for what happens next : I don ’ t know what NBC—or outside investigators—are going to find . I don ’ t know if it makes sense ( assuming no other transgressions ) for Williams to sit down with a smart , tough but fair inquisitor—Megyn Kelly ? Jon Stewart ? The scheduled appearance on Letterman Thursday ? —and answer whatever questions are thrown his way . It probably makes sense for Williams to shelve his considerable comedic gifts and stay away from Jimmy Fallon and Saturday Night Live .
I do know that there ’ s one idea that struck me as eminently on point . It comes from Matt Dowd , the recovering political operative and ABC News analyst , who tweeted : “ Maybe [ the ] news media can learn from this episode and start being a little more compassionate when others mess up . ”

On Tuesday , the president-elect met with The New York Times , just a day after a closed-door dressing down of network executives and anchors from CNN , MSNBC , NBC , ABC and CBS News . ███ executives were in attendance , but they would n't comment since it was an off the record briefing .
`` We 're in a room full of liars , the deceitful , dishonest media who got it all wrong , ” Trump told the gathering at Trump Tower , according to the New York Post .
HANNITY : TRUMP MUST IGNORE MEDIA , HOLLYWOOD HATERS AND LISTEN TO BACKERS
Trump reportedly took direct aim at CNN president Jeff Zucker , calling everyone at the network liars and saying Zucker should be ashamed of himself .
The president-elect did n't stop there . He reportedly hit NBC News for its coverage of his campaign and slammed ABC News 's Martha Raddatz , who was brought to near tears on air election night .
I 'm sure some in the room had their little feelings hurt , but really , who cares ? Did n't they deserve every bit of what Trump said to them ? Keep in mind , some of these so-called unbiased journalists laughed off Donald Trump and said he never stood a chance years before he even decided to run for president . And they each had to eat their words .
As for President-elect Trump ’ s meeting with The New York Times , I 'm sure the self-described “ paper of record ” was trying to smooth things over with Mr. Trump , and gloss over its unrelenting negative coverage of his campaign .
Mr. Trump should keep in mind that a few days before this meeting the Times praised former Obama adviser and current CNN contributor Van Jones as a `` star '' of the 2016 campaign . That would be the same Van Jones who was a member of the alt-radical left and who viciously attacked Donald Trump on a consistent basis throughout the campaign .
Jones even called Trump ’ s stunning victory a “ whitelash , ” a made-up term intended to inject a bogus racial element into support of Trump .
“ Oh , this is a really sad night , ” Jones said on CNN as it became clear that Trump would be our 45thpresident . “ I 'm just going to say it . This is a very sad night for the country . You ca n't polish this turd . ”
In 2008 , I said journalism was dead , but this election showed it was far worse than any of us ever thought . WikiLeaks exposed rampant collusion between the media and Hillary Clinton 's presidential campaign . We now know that interim Democratic National Committee chair Donna Brazile , while working for CNN , gave the Clinton campaign debate questions in advance . That 's called cheating .
CNN was soliciting the DNC for questions to ask Donald Trump , Ted Cruz and Carly Fiorina during their interviews . Reporters asked the Clinton campaign for approval before publishing their stories . One , a star reporter from Politico , even referred to himself as “ a hack ” while doing it . Other so-called journalists allowed the Clinton campaign to edit quotes .
Over at CNBC , John Harwood was offering the campaign advice and bragging about going after Trump in a debate that he was moderating . And worst of all , WikiLeaks exposed how dozens of journalists from every major news organization except ███ were invited to be wined and dined at Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta 's house .
Donald Trump should keep all of this in mind . The media already had its chance to cover him fairly and honestly . They blew it . And in my opinion , it 's time to reevaluate the press in this country , and maybe it 's time to change the traditional relationship that the press will have with the White House .
In this day and age of Twitter and Facebook and Instagram , does Trump really need to be granting access to biased journalists who openly oppose him ?
Until members of the media come clean about colluding with the Clinton campaign and admit that they knowingly broke every ethical standard that they 're supposed to stand and uphold , they should not have the privilege and responsibility of covering the president on behalf of you , the American people .
Adapted from Sean Hannity 's Nov. 22 , 2016 opening monologue on `` Hannity . ''","President-elect Donald Trump continued his beatdown of the abusively biased, alt-radical left mainstream media this week, calling out the press that openly colluded with the Clinton campaign and tried to undermine his candidacy every single step of the way.

On Tuesday, the president-elect met with The New York Times, just a day after a closed-door dressing down of network executives and anchors from CNN, MSNBC, NBC, ABC and CBS News. Fox News executives were in attendance, but they wouldn't comment since it was an off the record briefing.

""We're in a room full of liars, the deceitful, dishonest media who got it all wrong,” Trump told the gathering at Trump Tower, according to the New York Post.



HANNITY: TRUMP MUST IGNORE MEDIA, HOLLYWOOD HATERS AND LISTEN TO BACKERS



Trump reportedly took direct aim at CNN president Jeff Zucker, calling everyone at the network liars and saying Zucker should be ashamed of himself.

The president-elect didn't stop there. He reportedly hit NBC News for its coverage of his campaign and slammed ABC News's Martha Raddatz, who was brought to near tears on air election night.

I'm sure some in the room had their little feelings hurt, but really, who cares? Didn't they deserve every bit of what Trump said to them? Keep in mind, some of these so-called unbiased journalists laughed off Donald Trump and said he never stood a chance years before he even decided to run for president. And they each had to eat their words.

As for President-elect Trump’s meeting with The New York Times, I'm sure the self-described “paper of record” was trying to smooth things over with Mr. Trump, and gloss over its unrelenting negative coverage of his campaign.

Mr. Trump should keep in mind that a few days before this meeting the Times praised former Obama adviser and current CNN contributor Van Jones as a ""star"" of the 2016 campaign. That would be the same Van Jones who was a member of the alt-radical left and who viciously attacked Donald Trump on a consistent basis throughout the campaign.

Jones even called Trump’s stunning victory a “whitelash,” a made-up term intended to inject a bogus racial element into support of Trump.

“Oh, this is a really sad night,” Jones said on CNN as it became clear that Trump would be our 45thpresident. “I'm just going to say it. This is a very sad night for the country. You can't polish this turd.”

In 2008, I said journalism was dead, but this election showed it was far worse than any of us ever thought. WikiLeaks exposed rampant collusion between the media and Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. We now know that interim Democratic National Committee chair Donna Brazile, while working for CNN, gave the Clinton campaign debate questions in advance. That's called cheating.

CNN was soliciting the DNC for questions to ask Donald Trump, Ted Cruz and Carly Fiorina during their interviews. Reporters asked the Clinton campaign for approval before publishing their stories. One, a star reporter from Politico, even referred to himself as “a hack” while doing it. Other so-called journalists allowed the Clinton campaign to edit quotes.

Over at CNBC, John Harwood was offering the campaign advice and bragging about going after Trump in a debate that he was moderating. And worst of all, WikiLeaks exposed how dozens of journalists from every major news organization except Fox News were invited to be wined and dined at Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta's house.

Donald Trump should keep all of this in mind. The media already had its chance to cover him fairly and honestly. They blew it. And in my opinion, it's time to reevaluate the press in this country, and maybe it's time to change the traditional relationship that the press will have with the White House.

In this day and age of Twitter and Facebook and Instagram, does Trump really need to be granting access to biased journalists who openly oppose him?

Until members of the media come clean about colluding with the Clinton campaign and admit that they knowingly broke every ethical standard that they're supposed to stand and uphold, they should not have the privilege and responsibility of covering the president on behalf of you, the American people.

A Journal spokesman denied that the editor had suppressed the story.

“This project first published Tuesday morning and has been online ever since,” a Journal spokesman said in a statement to POLITICO. “The team will be adding additional reporting and analysis on the crisis and its aftermath.”

It’s that “additional reporting and analysis” that apparently caused the tension in the Journal newsroom that spilled out publicly Thursday afternoon.

One person familiar with the matter told POLITICO that “there was a miscommunication” and that Baker had not seen the final version of the story and graphics before they was published, and wanted them expanded. The person disputed the idea that Baker wanted to suppress the story, saying that he wanted to “put it to the side” and then resurface it in a more prominent position on the Journal’s web site once more information was added.

Baker wanted something “more exhaustive,” with more “macro-economic context,” according to the source, including “a lot more on the markets.” Without that information, he felt, “it was tilting in one direction” – making it too liberal.

A second Wall Street Journal newsroom employee confirmed that Baker was unhappy with the initial version and requested the additional information, so that the piece could later be re-launched.

Baker has faced criticism in the past for softening coverage of President Donald Trump. He has denied the criticisms, but claimed that other outlets had been too one-sided in their coverage of the 2016 election.

An editor tries to explain away the newspaper ’ s grossly unequal coverage of sexual-assault allegations .
A remarkable thing happened Monday : The New York Times executive editor , Dean Baquet , actually had to answer questions about his paper ’ s very different coverage of sexual-assault allegations against Joe Biden and Brett Kavanaugh . It did not go well . It is simply impossible to read the interview and the Times coverage of the two cases and come away believing that the Times acted in good faith or , frankly , that it even expects anyone to believe its explanations . The paper ’ s motto , at this point , may as well be “ All the News You ’ re Willing to Buy . ”
For all their lectures to the public about transparency and fearless independence , prestige journalists tend to be very reluctant to face accountability of their own . Ben Smith , who only recently left his position as editor in chief of BuzzFeed for a perch as media reporter for the Times , deserves credit for putting Baquet to some tough questioning . Let ’ s walk through the Times ’ very belated report on the Biden allegations and Baquet ’ s defenses of that reporting . The article , blandly titled “ Examining a Sexual Assault Allegation Against Biden , ” ran on A20 of the Easter Sunday edition of the paper . On the same day , the Times opinion page ran a much more visible op-ed by Biden himself on his proposals to reopen the country .
When Biden entered the presidential race in April 2019 , he was faced with a flurry of accusations by various women he ’ d interacted with over the years . The charges had a common thread : Biden has long been too free with his hands , with physical contact such as hugging and kissing and touching and smelling women ’ s hair , without regard for their personal space or consent . When the Times editorial board met with Biden in January , it asked him no questions about any of this , but it did press him over not being sufficiently aggressive in supporting Anita Hill ’ s sexual-harassment allegations against Clarence Thomas in 1991 .
Tara Reade was one of the women who accused Biden in early 2019 , but at the time , she did not accuse Biden of sexually assaulting her by penetrating her with his hands under her skirt , as she has now . Biden has never been asked personally to respond to Reade ’ s allegation . The Times assigned multiple reporters to the story but printed his campaign ’ s formal denials without addressing whether it had asked Biden himself to comment . Its report expressed no concerns that there has been inadequate investigation of the charge .
Smith started off by asking Baquet why it took until April 12 for the Times to even mention the allegations , which were made in a podcast interview on March 25 and reported at ███ and elsewhere within days :
Lots of people covered it as breaking news at the time . And I just thought that nobody other than The Intercept was actually doing the reporting to help people figure out what to make of it . . . . Mainly I thought that what The New York Times could offer and should try to offer was the reporting to help people understand what to make of a fairly serious allegation against a guy who had been a vice president of the United States and was knocking on the door of being his party ’ s nominee . Look , I get the argument . Just do a short , straightforward news story . But I ’ m not sure that doing this sort of straightforward news story would have helped the reader understand . Have all the information he or she needs to think about what to make of this thing .
So much for “ All the News That ’ s Fit to Print. ” This does not pass the laugh-out-loud test . Does any sentient being believe that the Times would have waited more than two weeks to even mention such an allegation against a Republican or conservative figure , while it tried to figure out how to tell its readers what “ he or she needs to think about what to make of this thing ” ? Recall its wall-to-wall instant coverage of the Trump “ Access Hollywood ” tape , which by the next day had a full news analysis by Maggie Haberman asking why Trump had not apologized yet .
In Kavanaugh ’ s case , on September 14 , 2018 , before Christine Blasey Ford had even put her name to a public allegation against Kavanaugh , the Times published a 31-paragraph story on the then-anonymous charge . Two days later , the very day that Ford agreed to come forward publicly , the Times blared out a Sheryl Gay Stolberg story , which opened
President Trump ’ s bid to confirm Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court was thrown into uncertainty on Sunday as a woman came forward with explosive allegations that Mr. Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers more than three decades ago .
Unlike here , the story led with the most inflammatory line in Ford ’ s allegations ( “ I thought he might inadvertently kill me ” ) and contrasted that with what it described as “ a terse statement ” from the White House , terms it did not use in framing the allegations against Biden . Then , the Times complained that “ some of the president ’ s allies on the right excoriated Ms. Ford — a registered Democrat — as a partisan. ” Here , the Times reported its reasons for skepticism of Reade ’ s political motivations ( supporting Marianne Williamson , then Elizabeth Warren , then Bernie Sanders ) without putting those accusations in the mouths of people primed to be disliked by Times readers .
The Stolberg article noted that “ Ms . Ford ’ s account opens a window into the exclusive prep school culture in which Mr. Kavanaugh grew up. ” This was a common theme throughout the Kavanaugh controversy : that if other women had been assaulted or harassed by other prep-school boys and frat boys in the several decades around the same time , or the several states of the Eastern Seaboard , this was probative evidence against Kavanaugh that required some sort of national conversation . Dozens of such articles were published . The Times ran an entire piece on a letter Kavanaugh wrote to some friends in 1983 , which it framed as shedding light on “ the binge-drinking culture ” of his high school . It ran another entire article on his high school yearbook .
Two Times reporters , Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly , published a book on the Kavanaugh allegations . When the Times promoted this project with a book excerpt in September 2019 on one of the flimsy “ similar ” allegations against Kavanaugh , under the headline , “ Brett Kavanaugh Fit In With the Privileged Kids . She Did Not , ” it had to be corrected . The correction gives a flavor of why :
( Emphasis added ) . You might think that would be a detail worth printing .
By contrast , while there have been notorious cases of sexual harassment ( and worse ) by several of Biden ’ s Senate friends and colleagues in the early 1990s , the Times piece on Reade goes out of its way to use that culture as a defense of Biden : “ Other senators and office staffs had reputations for harassing women at work and partying after hours , according to those who worked in the office at the time . Mr. Biden was known for racing to catch the train to get home to Wilmington , Del. , every night . ”
Kavanaugh-allegation coverage led the Times reporting for weeks after Ford ’ s charges , from poll analysis to Senate nose-counting to complaints about not having a more extensive FBI investigation to collecting reader suggestions on what questions Kavanaugh should answer . The Times editorial board ran editorials pushing Ford ’ s allegations and demanding a full airing on September 17 , September 19 , and September 27 . Other opinion contributors piled on in droves .
It got worse : When undeniably disreputable figures came out of the woodwork to offer lurid and preposterous tales of Kavanaugh ’ s supposed predations ( many of which have since been recanted or thoroughly debunked ) , the Times ran with them . As Smith notes , when since-convicted lawyer Michael Avenatti pushed forward the charges by Julie Swetnick of Kavanaugh ’ s involvement in gang rapes , “ The Times wrote that story the same day she made the allegation , noting that ‘ none of Ms. Swetnick ’ s claims could be independently corroborated. ’ ” Baquet ’ s response :
Kavanaugh was already in a public forum in a large way . Kavanaugh ’ s status as a Supreme Court justice was in question because of a very serious allegation . And when I say in a public way , I don ’ t mean in the public way of Tara Reade ’ s . If you ask the average person in America , they didn ’ t know about the Tara Reade case . So I thought in that case , if The New York Times was going to introduce this to readers , we needed to introduce it with some reporting and perspective . Kavanaugh was in a very different situation . It was a live , ongoing story that had become the biggest political story in the country . It was just a different news judgment moment . . . . Kavanaugh was a running , hot story . I don ’ t think it ’ s that the ethical standards were different . I think the news judgments had to be made from a different perspective in a running hot story .
This is entirely circular : If the media makes something a story , it becomes newsworthy ; if it ’ s not reported , the readers don ’ t know about it , so it ’ s not newsworthy . No purer distillation can be found of the idea that the media sets its own agenda .
How on earth do you pretend that Joe Biden ’ s character is not instantly newsworthy ? He ’ s the presumptive nominee of the Democratic Party for president . He was the vice president of the United States for eight years . He ’ s been a front-page news figure since the 1980s . Thought experiment : Imagine that an allegation came forward against Ken Starr . We all know that , because Starr was involved in pursuing the Lewinsky story , any whiff of sexual impropriety would instantly be framed as a hypocrisy story even long after Starr has left public service . Biden chaired the Hill-Thomas hearings in 1991 ; how is that not the same thing ?
We were constantly told that the Kavanaugh allegations should be judged by a low bar because the hearings were “ a job interview ” and he ’ d be confirmed to a powerful , life-tenured job . Well , presidents have a lot more power than any individual Supreme Court justice , including the power to appoint lots of life-tenured federal judges and justices . Isn ’ t this Biden ’ s job interview ?
Baquet bobs and weaves over factors that normally would go into evaluating the credibility of an allegation , such as the importance of telling someone else at the time . Reade provided witnesses to the Times who said they were told by her about sexual harassment ( not assault ) by Biden in 1993 , but they were unwilling to go on record ; Ford brought no such source forward : “ I don ’ t mean to imply that the notion that the person told someone contemporaneously is the ultimate test . It ’ s not . There are a lot of tests . ”
The Times report noted blandly that “ the seven other women who had complained about Mr. Biden told the Times this month that they did not have any new information about their experiences to add , but several said they believed Ms. Reade ’ s account. ” No further statements were elicited , in contrast to the lurid efforts to get supporting quotes for Ford from people who had never even met Kavanaugh . In fact , unlike Reade ( for whom the Times was easily able to confirm her employment in Biden ’ s office ) , there was never any corroborating evidence produced that Ford had ever met Kavanaugh .
The Times asked Reade about “ medium posts and tweets , several of which are now deleted , she had written praising President Vladimir Putin. ” Its reporting was never similarly curious about why Ford had purged her social-media accounts . Nor did the Times ever report that Ford ’ s own lawyer admitted after the hearings that “ part of what motivated Christine ” was wanting to put “ an asterisk next to his name . ”
SMITH : I want to ask about some edits that were made after publication , the deletion of the second half of the sentence : “ The Times found no pattern of sexual misconduct by Mr. Biden , beyond the hugs , kisses and touching that women previously said made them uncomfortable. ” Why did you do that ? BAQUET : Even though a lot of us , including me , had looked at it before the story went into the paper , I think that the campaign thought that the phrasing was awkward and made it look like there were other instances in which he had been accused of sexual misconduct . And that ’ s not what the sentence was intended to say .
That “ beyond the hugs , kisses and touching that women previously said made them uncomfortable ” is a pretty big “ other than. ” But even more damning is Baquet ’ s open admission that he changed the line under pressure from “ the campaign ” — Joe Biden ’ s campaign . We know who really calls the shots here .","People line up for taxi across the street from the New York Times building in New York City in 2013. (Carlo Allegri/Reuters)

Editors’ Note: Sept. 15, 2019 An earlier version of this article, which was adapted from a forthcoming book, did not include one element of the book’s account regarding an assertion by a Yale classmate that friends of Brett Kavanaugh pushed his penis into the hand of a female student at a drunken dorm party. The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article.

(Emphasis added). You might think that would be a detail worth printing.

By contrast, while there have been notorious cases of sexual harassment (and worse) by several of Biden’s Senate friends and colleagues in the early 1990s, the Times piece on Reade goes out of its way to use that culture as a defense of Biden: “Other senators and office staffs had reputations for harassing women at work and partying after hours, according to those who worked in the office at the time. Mr. Biden was known for racing to catch the train to get home to Wilmington, Del., every night.”

Kavanaugh-allegation coverage led the Times reporting for weeks after Ford’s charges, from poll analysis to Senate nose-counting to complaints about not having a more extensive FBI investigation to collecting reader suggestions on what questions Kavanaugh should answer. The Times editorial board ran editorials pushing Ford’s allegations and demanding a full airing on September 17, September 19, and September 27. Other opinion contributors piled on in droves.

It got worse: When undeniably disreputable figures came out of the woodwork to offer lurid and preposterous tales of Kavanaugh’s supposed predations (many of which have since been recanted or thoroughly debunked), the Times ran with them. As Smith notes, when since-convicted lawyer Michael Avenatti pushed forward the charges by Julie Swetnick of Kavanaugh’s involvement in gang rapes, “The Times wrote that story the same day she made the allegation, noting that ‘none of Ms. Swetnick’s claims could be independently corroborated.’” Baquet’s response:

Kavanaugh was already in a public forum in a large way. Kavanaugh’s status as a Supreme Court justice was in question because of a very serious allegation. And when I say in a public way, I don’t mean in the public way of Tara Reade’s. If you ask the average person in America, they didn’t know about the Tara Reade case. So I thought in that case, if The New York Times was going to introduce this to readers, we needed to introduce it with some reporting and perspective. Kavanaugh was in a very different situation. It was a live, ongoing story that had become the biggest political story in the country. It was just a different news judgment moment. . . . Kavanaugh was a running, hot story. I don’t think it’s that the ethical standards were different. I think the news judgments had to be made from a different perspective in a running hot story.

This is entirely circular: If the media makes something a story, it becomes newsworthy; if it’s not reported, the readers don’t know about it, so it’s not newsworthy. No purer distillation can be found of the idea that the media sets its own agenda.

How on earth do you pretend that Joe Biden’s character is not instantly newsworthy? He’s the presumptive nominee of the Democratic Party for president. He was the vice president of the United States for eight years. He’s been a front-page news figure since the 1980s. Thought experiment: Imagine that an allegation came forward against Ken Starr. We all know that, because Starr was involved in pursuing the Lewinsky story, any whiff of sexual impropriety would instantly be framed as a hypocrisy story even long after Starr has left public service. Biden chaired the Hill-Thomas hearings in 1991; how is that not the same thing?

We were constantly told that the Kavanaugh allegations should be judged by a low bar because the hearings were “a job interview” and he’d be confirmed to a powerful, life-tenured job. Well, presidents have a lot more power than any individual Supreme Court justice, including the power to appoint lots of life-tenured federal judges and justices. Isn’t this Biden’s job interview?

Baquet bobs and weaves over factors that normally would go into evaluating the credibility of an allegation, such as the importance of telling someone else at the time. Reade provided witnesses to the Times who said they were told by her about sexual harassment (not assault) by Biden in 1993, but they were unwilling to go on record; Ford brought no such source forward: “I don’t mean to imply that the notion that the person told someone contemporaneously is the ultimate test. It’s not. There are a lot of tests.”

The Times report noted blandly that “the seven other women who had complained about Mr. Biden told the Times this month that they did not have any new information about their experiences to add, but several said they believed Ms. Reade’s account.” No further statements were elicited, in contrast to the lurid efforts to get supporting quotes for Ford from people who had never even met Kavanaugh. In fact, unlike Reade (for whom the Times was easily able to confirm her employment in Biden’s office), there was never any corroborating evidence produced that Ford had ever met Kavanaugh.

The Times asked Reade about “medium posts and tweets, several of which are now deleted, she had written praising President Vladimir Putin.” Its reporting was never similarly curious about why Ford had purged her social-media accounts. Nor did the Times ever report that Ford’s own lawyer admitted after the hearings that “part of what motivated Christine” was wanting to put “an asterisk next to his name.”

Then there was this doozy of an exchange:

SMITH: I want to ask about some edits that were made after publication, the deletion of the second half of the sentence: “The Times found no pattern of sexual misconduct by Mr. Biden, beyond the hugs, kisses and touching that women previously said made them uncomfortable.” Why did you do that? BAQUET: Even though a lot of us, including me, had looked at it before the story went into the paper, I think that the campaign thought that the phrasing was awkward and made it look like there were other instances in which he had been accused of sexual misconduct. And that’s not what the sentence was intended to say.

That “beyond the hugs, kisses and touching that women previously said made them uncomfortable” is a pretty big “other than.” But even more damning is Baquet’s open admission that he changed the line under pressure from “the campaign” — Joe Biden’s campaign.

PANDEMIC POLITICS: TRUMP, BIDEN AND THE VIRTUAL CAMPAIGN

As America’s coronavirus death toll exceeds 10,000, two clashing narratives have come to define the president’s handling of the pandemic. Trump is courageously leading the country with a disruptive approach despite the naysayers, according to his supporters, or, from a press perspective, he is royally botching the emergency because of severe character limitations.

Trump posted four positive retweets after Sunday’s edition of “Media Buzz” as he embraced criticism of the press. It’s not the first time he’s commented on my program, sometimes critically--he’s also called supporters after their appearances--but it underscores a sharp focus on his coverage as a self-proclaimed wartime president.

The president seems increasingly disgusted with the media, even beyond the bitter hostilities of the Russia probe and the impeachment battle. At pressers over the weekend, he accused certain outlets of spreading false rumors, fear and panic.

And, given the life-and-death stakes, the press seems increasingly angry with Trump. Liberal Times columnist Frank Bruni says he’s “shriveling into nothingness” in a piece titled “Has Anyone Found Trump’s Soul? Anyone?”

But the ending was a pathetic whimper , and not a bang .
And yet they are still obsessing even more , night after night .
The latest research on the Big Three evening newscasts by Rich Noyes at the Media Research Center proves their irrational behavior . Their total Trump-Russia coverage registered at 196 minutes from January 1 to the first Mueller Report findings on March 21 , but then skyrocketed to a whopping 317 minutes from March 22 through May 31 , after Mueller cleared Trump completely on the charge of collusion while stating there was not enough evidence to indict him on obstruction .
Network news reporters are on a new jihad – impeachment . That possibility is being raised an average of 22.4 evening stories per month in the wake of Mueller ’ s report , nearly triple the 7.7 stories per month during the first part of the year before Mueller concluded .
Do the math . Since the president ’ s been cleared , stories suggesting his guilt have risen by a factor of three .
What a waste of our time , this incessant speculation of doom from the press , repeated thousands of times ad nauseam . The liberal elites believe that if only the American voters had been unmolested by the Russian meddlers , President Hillary would be in the White House bending their Arc of History… instead of wandering the woods asking what happened .
Despite their proclamations that they are the guardians of facts , the liberal elite wanted to fast-forward beyond that silly thing called evidence and see Trump 's ruin as inevitable . Sentence first , verdict later . After that , evidence ... if any . Impeachment was perpetually on their minds , and often on their lips . Month after month went by with no proof surfacing of actual Trump campaign collusion with the Russians . It never mattered . Keeping the doom and gloom is what mattered .
The same reporters who effortlessly spread the Fake News that Barack Obama was `` scandal-free '' were now dedicating themselves to the opposite , cementing the proposition that Donald Trump was the worst criminal who ever lived in the White House , even an agent of the Russian government .
These same “ objective ” journalists who shamelessly whacked away at Kenneth Starr as a modern knock-off of the inquisitor Torquemada were presenting Mueller as the 21st-century incarnation of Eliot Ness . Time magazine called him “ the personification of the rule of law. ” But two decades ago , Time trashed Starr as Bill Clinton ’ s scandalous twin : “ he still dreams of being found not guilty. ” The only thing consistent about the press is its partisanship .
At this point , accusing Trump of colluding with Russia is geopolitical birtherism . It ’ s a baseless conspiracy theory pretending to be a silver bullet to the heart of Trump ’ s presidency . It ably illustrates how the press set out to destroy Trump , and destroyed their own reputations instead .","Color us surprised.

Their total Trump-Russia coverage registered at 196 minutes from January 1 to the first Mueller Report findings on March 21, but then skyrocketed to a whopping 317 minutes from March 22 through May 31, after Mueller cleared Trump completely on the charge of collusion while stating there was not enough evidence to indict him on obstruction.

Network news reporters are on a new jihad – impeachment. That possibility is being raised an average of 22.4 evening stories per month in the wake of Mueller’s report, nearly triple the 7.7 stories per month during the first part of the year before Mueller concluded.

Do the math. Since the president’s been cleared, stories suggesting his guilt have risen by a factor of three.

What a waste of our time, this incessant speculation of doom from the press, repeated thousands of times ad nauseam. The liberal elites believe that if only the American voters had been unmolested by the Russian meddlers, President Hillary would be in the White House bending their Arc of History… instead of wandering the woods asking what happened.

Despite their proclamations that they are the guardians of facts, the liberal elite wanted to fast-forward beyond that silly thing called evidence and see Trump's ruin as inevitable. Sentence first, verdict later. After that, evidence...if any. Impeachment was perpetually on their minds, and often on their lips. Month after month went by with no proof surfacing of actual Trump campaign collusion with the Russians. It never mattered. Keeping the doom and gloom is what mattered.

The same reporters who effortlessly spread the Fake News that Barack Obama was ""scandal-free"" were now dedicating themselves to the opposite, cementing the proposition that Donald Trump was the worst criminal who ever lived in the White House, even an agent of the Russian government.

These same “objective” journalists who shamelessly whacked away at Kenneth Starr as a modern knock-off of the inquisitor Torquemada were presenting Mueller as the 21st-century incarnation of Eliot Ness. Time magazine called him “the personification of the rule of law.” But two decades ago, Time trashed Starr as Bill Clinton’s scandalous twin: “he still dreams of being found not guilty.” The only thing consistent about the press is its partisanship.

At this point, accusing Trump of colluding with Russia is geopolitical birtherism. It’s a baseless conspiracy theory pretending to be a silver bullet to the heart of Trump’s presidency. It ably illustrates how the press set out to destroy Trump, and destroyed their own reputations instead.",www.newsbusters.org,right,dmQw09DULizuzYIl

The fact is that almost the entirety of what one reads in the paper or on the web is speculation. The writer isn’t telling you what happened, he is offering an interpretation of what happened, or offering a projection of the future. The best scenario is that these theories are novel, compelling, informed, and based on reporting and research. But that is rarely the case.

After Another Special-Election Loss, Chances for a Democratic Comeback Look Grim

media_bias,Fox News,2,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nyt-kavanaugh-bombshell-goes-bust-after-2020-dems-use-it-to-call-for-impeachment,NYT updates Kavanaugh 'bombshell' to note accuser doesn't recall alleged assault,,"Gregg Re, Mark Hemingway","The New York Times suddenly made a major revision to a supposed bombshell piece late Sunday concerning a resurfaced allegation of sexual assault by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh — hours after virtually all 2020 Democratic presidential candidates had cited the original article as a reason to impeach Kavanaugh .
The update included the significant detail that several friends of the alleged victim , Harmon Joyce , said she did not recall the purported sexual assault in question at all . The Times also stated for the first time that the alleged victim refused to be interviewed , and has made no other comment about the episode .
The only firsthand account concerning the supposed attack in the original piece , which was published on Saturday , came from a Clinton-connected lawyer who claimed to have witnessed it . ( The lawyer , Max Stier , did not actually provide his account directly ; the Times acknowledged that `` two officials who have communicated with Mr. Stier '' had relayed his supposed version of events . )
Even after the revision , the Times ' story still does not mention a separate revelation in the book that Leland Keyser , the friend of Christine Blasey Ford who was allegedly at the party where Kavanaugh supposedly assaulted her , had specifically rejected Ford 's claims . Previously , through her attorney , Keyser had said only that she was `` unable to corroborate it because she has no recollection of the incident in question . ”
“ I don ’ t have any confidence in the story , ” Keyser told the reporters , according to the book . `` Those facts together I do n't recollect , and it just did n't make any sense . ''
The Times ' update came only after The Federalist 's Mollie Hemingway , who reviewed an advance copy of the book , first flagged the article 's omission on Twitter — prompting other commentators to press the issue .
The Times did not immediately respond to an email from ███ seeking comment .
The paper 's editors ' note , meanwhile , did little to stem a torrent of criticism late Sunday .
`` Should I be surprised at this point that the NYT would make such an unforgivable oversight ? '' — Mark Hemingway
`` Should I be surprised at this point that the NYT would make such an unforgivable oversight ? '' asked RealClearInvestigations ' Mark Hemingway .
Wrote the Washington Examiner 's Jerry Dunleavy : `` Crazy how the 'one element ' that wasn ’ t included in the original article was the part where the alleged victim ’ s friends said she doesn ’ t remember it happening . ''
`` It ’ s important to point out that this correction almost certainly would have never occurred if conservative media folks like @ MZHemingway and others hadn ’ t obtained the copy of the actual book itself the same day the excerpt/article was released , '' author James Hasson said .
Throughout the day on Sunday , Kamala Harris , Elizabeth Warren , Bernie Sanders , Beto O'Rourke , Cory Booker and Julian Castro , among others , declared that Kavanaugh `` must be impeached , '' citing the allegation .
The revitalized , longshot push to get Kavanaugh removed from the high court came as Democrats ' apparent effort to impeach President Trump has largely stalled . Trump , for his part , suggested Sunday that Kavanaugh should sue for defamation .
The Times piece by Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly , adapted from their forthcoming book , asserted that a Kavanaugh classmate , Clinton-linked nonprofit CEO Max Stier , `` saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party , where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student . ''
The Times did not mention Stier 's work as a Clinton defense attorney , or Stier 's legal battles with Kavanaugh during the Whitewater investigation , and simply called him a `` respected thought leader . ''
According to the Times , Stier `` notified senators and the FBI about this account '' last year during the Kavanaugh hearings , `` but the FBI did not investigate and Mr. Stier has declined to discuss it publicly . ''
However , the Times ' article also conspicuously did not mention that Pogrebin and Kelly 's book found that the female student in question had denied any knowledge of the alleged episode .
`` The book notes , quietly , that the woman Max Stier named as having been supposedly victimized by Kavanaugh and friends denies any memory of the alleged event , '' observed Mollie Hemingway . `` Seems , I don ’ t know , significant . ''
'PART OF WHAT MOTIVATED ' CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD WAS TO PUT POLITICAL 'ASTERISK ' ON KAVANAUGH , LAWYER ADMITS
The book reads : `` [ Tracy ] Harmon , whose surname is now Harmon Joyce , has also refused to discuss the incident , though several of her friends said she does not recall it . ''
`` Omitting these facts from the @ nytimes story is one of worst cases of journalistic malpractice that I can recall , '' wrote the National Review 's Washington correspondent , John McCormack , on Twitter .
McCormack wrote separately : `` If Kavanaugh ’ s 'friends pushed his penis , ' then isn ’ t it an allegation of wrongdoing against Kavanaugh ’ s 'friends , ' not Kavanaugh himself ? Surely even a modern liberal Yalie who ’ s been to one of those weird non-sexual 'naked parties ' would recognize both the female student and Kavanaugh are both alleged victims in this alleged incident , barring an additional allegation that a college-aged Kavanaugh asked his 'friends ' to 'push his penis . ' ''
NEW YORK TIMES DELETES TWEET CALLING UNPROVOKED PENIS THRUSTING 'HARMLESS FUN '
The Times went on to note in the article that it had `` corroborated the story with two officials who have communicated with Mr. Stier , '' but the article apparently meant only that the Times had corroborated that Stier made his claim to the FBI . No first-hand corroboration of the alleged episode was apparently obtained .
Nevertheless , Democrats announced a new effort to topple Kavanaugh . Hawaii Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono -- who infamously said last year that Kavanaugh did not deserve a fair hearing because he might be pro-life -- said the Senate Judiciary Committee should begin an impeachment inquiry to determine whether Kavanaugh lied to Congress .
Impeaching Kavanaugh would require a majority vote in the Democratic-controlled House , and a highly unlikely two-thirds vote in the GOP-majority Senate would then be needed to remove him from the bench . No Supreme Court justice or president has ever been convicted by the Senate , although eight lower-level federal judges have been .
The long odds did n't stop 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls from joining in on the effort .
`` I sat through those hearings , '' Harris wrote on Twitter . `` Brett Kavanaugh lied to the U.S. Senate and most importantly to the American people . He was put on the Court through a sham process and his place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice . He must be impeached . ''
During the hearings , Harris strongly implied that she knew Kavanaugh had improperly discussed Special Counsel Robert Mueller 's then-ongoing probe with a Trump-connected lawyer .
Harris provided no evidence for the bombshell insinuation , which went viral on social media and sent the hearing room into stunned silence , even as she directly accused Kavanaugh of lying under oath .
Castro and Warren echoed that sentiment and said Kavanaugh had committed perjury .
FLASHBACK : ███ POLL SHOWS KAVANAUGH FIGHT HAS REVITALIZED GOP BASE , INCREASED REPUBLICAN INTEREST IN ELECTION
`` It ’ s more clear than ever that Brett Kavanaugh lied under oath , '' Castro wrote . `` He should be impeached . And Congress should review the failure of the Department of Justice to properly investigate the matter . ''
Warren wrote : `` Last year the Kavanaugh nomination was rammed through the Senate without a thorough examination of the allegations against him . Confirmation is not exoneration , and these newest revelations are disturbing . Like the man who appointed him , Kavanaugh should be impeached . ''
O'Rourke claimed to `` know '' that Kavanaugh had lied under oath , and falsely said that the new accuser was not known to Senate Democrats or the FBI last year .
`` Yesterday , we learned of another accusation against Brett Kavanaugh—one we did n't find out about before he was confirmed because the Senate forced the F.B.I . to rush its investigation to save his nomination , '' O'Rourke said . `` We know he lied under oath . He should be impeached . ''
Sen. Cory Booker , D-N.J. , tweeted in part , `` This new allegation and additional corroborating evidence adds to a long list of reasons why Brett Kavanaugh should not be a Supreme Court justice . I stand with survivors and countless other Americans in calling for impeachment proceedings to begin . ''
Amy Klobuchar stopped short of calling for impeachment , and instead posted a picture of Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford with the words , `` Let us never forget what courage looks like . ''
DEM SENATOR CITES KAVANAUGH 'S ALLEGED PRO-LIFE LEANINGS AS REASON TO DENY HIM A FAIR HEARING
Bernie Sanders , meanwhile , said he backed getting rid of Kavanaugh by any legal means available : `` The revelations today confirm what we already knew : During his hearing , Kavanaugh faced credible accusations and likely lied to Congress . I support any appropriate constitutional mechanism to hold him accountable . ''
As the calls mounted , Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , shot back Sunday afternoon on Twitter -- and made clear that Kavanaugh was n't going anywhere .
`` The far left ’ s willingness to seize on completely uncorroborated and unsubstantiated allegations during last year ’ s confirmation process was a dark and embarrassing chapter for the Senate , '' McConnell wrote .
He added : `` Fortunately a majority of Senators and the American people rallied behind timeless principles such as due process and the presumption of innocence . I look forward to many years of service to come from Justice Kavanaugh . ''
The Times ' piece also stated that well before Kavanaugh became a federal judge , `` at least seven people '' had heard about how he allegedly exposed himself to Deborah Ramirez at a party .
Ramirez had called classmates at Yale seeking corroboration for her story , and even told some of her classmates that she could not remember the culprit in the alleged episode -- before changing her mind and publicly blaming Kavanaugh `` after six days of carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorney , '' the New Yorker reported last year in a widely derided piece .
The Senate Judiciary Committee , then led by Chuck Grassley , R-Iowa , wrote in an executive summary of its investigation that it contacted Ramirez ’ s counsel `` seven times seeking evidence to support claims made in the New Yorker , '' but that `` Ms. Ramirez produced nothing in response and refused a Committee request for an interview . ''
Late Sunday , Grassley 's office called out the Times for omitting key details in the story published this weekend .
`` @ NYTimes did not contact Sen. Grassley ’ s office for this story . If they had , we would 've reminded them of a few key public facts they omitted , '' Grassley 's team wrote . `` Despite 7 attempts by staff , Ms. Ramirez ' lawyers declined to provide documentary evidence referenced in the article/witness accounts to support the claims . They also declined invitations for Ms. Ramirez to speak with committee investigators or to provide a written statement . ''
Additionally , the FBI separately reached out to nearly a dozen individuals to corroborate the allegations by Ford and Ramirez , and ultimately spoke to ten individuals and two eyewitnesses , but apparently found no corroboration .
The agency 's investigation began after then-Sen. Jeff Flake , R-Ariz. , called for a one-week delay in Kavanaugh 's confirmation hearings so an independent agency could look into the claims against him . Flake said the FBI 's probe needed to be limited in length to avoid derailing the proceedings with endless claims and probes going back to Kavanaugh 's high school years .
Kavanaugh , predicted by Democrats during his confirmation process to be a hardline conservative , often sided with liberal justices during the Supreme Court 's last term .
The president , meanwhile , accused the media of trying to influence Kavanaugh . He also went on to say that Kavanaugh should go on the offensive and take on the media for false statements .
`` Brett Kavanaugh should start suing people for libel , or the Justice Department should come to his rescue . The lies being told about him are unbelievable . False Accusations without recrimination . When does it stop ? They are trying to influence his opinions . Can ’ t let that happen ! '' he tweeted .
Grassley sent several criminal referrals to the Justice Department related to alleged lies submitted to Senate investigators during Kavanaugh 's confirmation process -- which could be what the president meant when he wrote Sunday that the DOJ `` should come to [ Kavanuagh 's ] rescue . ''
One of those referrals was for now-disgraced attorney Michael Avenatti and one of his clients , Julie Swetnick , regarding a potential `` conspiracy '' to provide false statements to Congress and obstruct its investigation . Swetnick 's credibility took a hit as she changed her story about Kavanaugh 's purported gang-rape trains , and her ex-boyfriend went public to say she was known for `` exaggerating everything . ''
Swetnick and Ramirez were just two of several women who had accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct during his confirmation process . Christine Blasey Ford notably testified that Kavanaugh attempted to sexually assault her at a party when they were teens , and dubiously asserted that the memory was `` indelible '' in her `` hippocampus '' -- although no witnesses could corroborate her ever-changing story -- even her close lifelong friend , Leland Keyser , who Ford said had attended the party .
Keyser , according to the Times reporters ' new book , did not believe Ford 's story -- and refused to change her mind , despite pressure from progressive activists and Ford 's friends .
`` It just did n't make any sense , '' Keyser said , referring to Ford 's explanation of how she was assaulted at a party that Keyser attended , but could not recall how she got home .
Ford 's attorney , Debra Katz , was quoted in a new book as saying that Ford was motivated to come forward in part by a desire to tag Kavanaugh 's reputation with an `` asterisk '' before he could start ruling on abortion-related cases .
`` In the aftermath of these hearings , I believe that Christine ’ s testimony brought about more good than the harm misogynist Republicans caused by allowing Kavanaugh on the court , '' Katz said . `` He will always have an asterisk next to his name . When he takes a scalpel to Roe v. Wade , we will know who he is , we know his character , and we know what motivates him , and that is important .
`` It is important that we know , and that is part of what motivated Christine . ''
The Federalist reported last week that Ford 's father privately supported Kavanaugh 's confirmation , and approached Ed Kavanaugh on a golf course to make his support clear .
Some claims that surfaced during Kavanaugh 's confirmation fell apart within days . For example , Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse , D-R.I. , received a call from an anonymous constituent who claimed that in 1985 , two `` heavily inebriated men '' referred to as `` Brett and Mark '' had sexually assaulted a friend of hers on a boat .
The Twitter account belonging to the accuser apparently advocated for a military coup against the Trump administration . The constituent recanted the sexual assault claim on the social media site days later .","The New York Times suddenly made a major revision to a supposed bombshell piece late Sunday concerning a resurfaced allegation of sexual assault by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh — hours after virtually all 2020 Democratic presidential candidates had cited the original article as a reason to impeach Kavanaugh.

The update included the significant detail that several friends of the alleged victim, Harmon Joyce, said she did not recall the purported sexual assault in question at all. The Times also stated for the first time that the alleged victim refused to be interviewed, and has made no other comment about the episode.

The only firsthand account concerning the supposed attack in the original piece, which was published on Saturday, came from a Clinton-connected lawyer who claimed to have witnessed it. (The lawyer, Max Stier, did not actually provide his account directly; the Times acknowledged that ""two officials who have communicated with Mr. Stier"" had relayed his supposed version of events.)

The Times' revision says: ""Editors' Note: An earlier version of this article, which was adapted from a forthcoming book, did not include one element of the book's account regarding an assertion by a Yale classmate that friends of Brett Kavanaugh pushed his penis into the hand of a female student at a drunken dorm party. The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article.""

Even after the revision, the Times' story still does not mention a separate revelation in the book that Leland Keyser, the friend of Christine Blasey Ford who was allegedly at the party where Kavanaugh supposedly assaulted her, had specifically rejected Ford's claims. Previously, through her attorney, Keyser had said only that she was ""unable to corroborate it because she has no recollection of the incident in question.”

“I don’t have any confidence in the story,” Keyser told the reporters, according to the book. ""Those facts together I don't recollect, and it just didn't make any sense.""

The Times' update came only after The Federalist's Mollie Hemingway, who reviewed an advance copy of the book, first flagged the article's omission on Twitter — prompting other commentators to press the issue.

The Times did not immediately respond to an email from Fox News seeking comment.

The paper's editors' note, meanwhile, did little to stem a torrent of criticism late Sunday.

""Should I be surprised at this point that the NYT would make such an unforgivable oversight?"" — Mark Hemingway

""Should I be surprised at this point that the NYT would make such an unforgivable oversight?"" asked RealClearInvestigations' Mark Hemingway.

Wrote the Washington Examiner's Jerry Dunleavy: ""Crazy how the 'one element' that wasn’t included in the original article was the part where the alleged victim’s friends said she doesn’t remember it happening.""

""It’s important to point out that this correction almost certainly would have never occurred if conservative media folks like @MZHemingway and others hadn’t obtained the copy of the actual book itself the same day the excerpt/article was released,"" author James Hasson said.

Throughout the day on Sunday, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Beto O'Rourke, Cory Booker and Julian Castro, among others, declared that Kavanaugh ""must be impeached,"" citing the allegation.

The revitalized, longshot push to get Kavanaugh removed from the high court came as Democrats' apparent effort to impeach President Trump has largely stalled. Trump, for his part, suggested Sunday that Kavanaugh should sue for defamation.

The Times piece by Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, adapted from their forthcoming book, asserted that a Kavanaugh classmate, Clinton-linked nonprofit CEO Max Stier, ""saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student.""

The Times did not mention Stier's work as a Clinton defense attorney, or Stier's legal battles with Kavanaugh during the Whitewater investigation, and simply called him a ""respected thought leader.""

According to the Times, Stier ""notified senators and the FBI about this account"" last year during the Kavanaugh hearings, ""but the FBI did not investigate and Mr. Stier has declined to discuss it publicly.""

However, the Times' article also conspicuously did not mention that Pogrebin and Kelly's book found that the female student in question had denied any knowledge of the alleged episode.

""The book notes, quietly, that the woman Max Stier named as having been supposedly victimized by Kavanaugh and friends denies any memory of the alleged event,"" observed Mollie Hemingway. ""Seems, I don’t know, significant.""

'PART OF WHAT MOTIVATED' CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD WAS TO PUT POLITICAL 'ASTERISK' ON KAVANAUGH, LAWYER ADMITS

The book reads: ""[Tracy] Harmon, whose surname is now Harmon Joyce, has also refused to discuss the incident, though several of her friends said she does not recall it.""

""Omitting these facts from the @nytimes story is one of worst cases of journalistic malpractice that I can recall,"" wrote the National Review's Washington correspondent, John McCormack, on Twitter.

McCormack wrote separately: ""If Kavanaugh’s 'friends pushed his penis,' then isn’t it an allegation of wrongdoing against Kavanaugh’s 'friends,' not Kavanaugh himself? Surely even a modern liberal Yalie who’s been to one of those weird non-sexual 'naked parties' would recognize both the female student and Kavanaugh are both alleged victims in this alleged incident, barring an additional allegation that a college-aged Kavanaugh asked his 'friends' to 'push his penis.'""

NEW YORK TIMES DELETES TWEET CALLING UNPROVOKED PENIS THRUSTING 'HARMLESS FUN'

The Times went on to note in the article that it had ""corroborated the story with two officials who have communicated with Mr. Stier,"" but the article apparently meant only that the Times had corroborated that Stier made his claim to the FBI. No first-hand corroboration of the alleged episode was apparently obtained.

Nevertheless, Democrats announced a new effort to topple Kavanaugh. Hawaii Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono -- who infamously said last year that Kavanaugh did not deserve a fair hearing because he might be pro-life -- said the Senate Judiciary Committee should begin an impeachment inquiry to determine whether Kavanaugh lied to Congress.

Impeaching Kavanaugh would require a majority vote in the Democratic-controlled House, and a highly unlikely two-thirds vote in the GOP-majority Senate would then be needed to remove him from the bench. No Supreme Court justice or president has ever been convicted by the Senate, although eight lower-level federal judges have been.

The long odds didn't stop 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls from joining in on the effort.

""I sat through those hearings,"" Harris wrote on Twitter. ""Brett Kavanaugh lied to the U.S. Senate and most importantly to the American people. He was put on the Court through a sham process and his place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice. He must be impeached.""

During the hearings, Harris strongly implied that she knew Kavanaugh had improperly discussed Special Counsel Robert Mueller's then-ongoing probe with a Trump-connected lawyer.

Harris provided no evidence for the bombshell insinuation, which went viral on social media and sent the hearing room into stunned silence, even as she directly accused Kavanaugh of lying under oath.

Castro and Warren echoed that sentiment and said Kavanaugh had committed perjury.

FLASHBACK: GRAHAM SAYS DEMS' KAVANAUGH SMEARS HAVE UNITED REPUBLICANS

FLASHBACK: FOX NEWS POLL SHOWS KAVANAUGH FIGHT HAS REVITALIZED GOP BASE, INCREASED REPUBLICAN INTEREST IN ELECTION

""It’s more clear than ever that Brett Kavanaugh lied under oath,"" Castro wrote. ""He should be impeached. And Congress should review the failure of the Department of Justice to properly investigate the matter.""

Warren wrote: ""Last year the Kavanaugh nomination was rammed through the Senate without a thorough examination of the allegations against him. Confirmation is not exoneration, and these newest revelations are disturbing. Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached.""

O'Rourke claimed to ""know"" that Kavanaugh had lied under oath, and falsely said that the new accuser was not known to Senate Democrats or the FBI last year.

""Yesterday, we learned of another accusation against Brett Kavanaugh—one we didn't find out about before he was confirmed because the Senate forced the F.B.I. to rush its investigation to save his nomination,"" O'Rourke said. ""We know he lied under oath. He should be impeached.""

Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., tweeted in part, ""This new allegation and additional corroborating evidence adds to a long list of reasons why Brett Kavanaugh should not be a Supreme Court justice. I stand with survivors and countless other Americans in calling for impeachment proceedings to begin.""

Amy Klobuchar stopped short of calling for impeachment, and instead posted a picture of Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford with the words, ""Let us never forget what courage looks like.""

DEM SENATOR CITES KAVANAUGH'S ALLEGED PRO-LIFE LEANINGS AS REASON TO DENY HIM A FAIR HEARING

Bernie Sanders, meanwhile, said he backed getting rid of Kavanaugh by any legal means available: ""The revelations today confirm what we already knew: During his hearing, Kavanaugh faced credible accusations and likely lied to Congress. I support any appropriate constitutional mechanism to hold him accountable.""

As the calls mounted, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., shot back Sunday afternoon on Twitter -- and made clear that Kavanaugh wasn't going anywhere.

""The far left’s willingness to seize on completely uncorroborated and unsubstantiated allegations during last year’s confirmation process was a dark and embarrassing chapter for the Senate,"" McConnell wrote.

He added: ""Fortunately a majority of Senators and the American people rallied behind timeless principles such as due process and the presumption of innocence. I look forward to many years of service to come from Justice Kavanaugh.""

The Times' piece also stated that well before Kavanaugh became a federal judge, ""at least seven people"" had heard about how he allegedly exposed himself to Deborah Ramirez at a party.

Ramirez had called classmates at Yale seeking corroboration for her story, and even told some of her classmates that she could not remember the culprit in the alleged episode -- before changing her mind and publicly blaming Kavanaugh ""after six days of carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorney,"" the New Yorker reported last year in a widely derided piece.

The Senate Judiciary Committee, then led by Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, wrote in an executive summary of its investigation that it contacted Ramirez’s counsel ""seven times seeking evidence to support claims made in the New Yorker,"" but that ""Ms. Ramirez produced nothing in response and refused a Committee request for an interview.""

Late Sunday, Grassley's office called out the Times for omitting key details in the story published this weekend.

""@NYTimes did not contact Sen. Grassley’s office for this story. If they had, we would've reminded them of a few key public facts they omitted,"" Grassley's team wrote. ""Despite 7 attempts by staff, Ms. Ramirez' lawyers declined to provide documentary evidence referenced in the article/witness accounts to support the claims. They also declined invitations for Ms. Ramirez to speak with committee investigators or to provide a written statement.""

Additionally, the FBI separately reached out to nearly a dozen individuals to corroborate the allegations by Ford and Ramirez, and ultimately spoke to ten individuals and two eyewitnesses, but apparently found no corroboration.

The agency's investigation began after then-Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., called for a one-week delay in Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings so an independent agency could look into the claims against him. Flake said the FBI's probe needed to be limited in length to avoid derailing the proceedings with endless claims and probes going back to Kavanaugh's high school years.

Kavanaugh, predicted by Democrats during his confirmation process to be a hardline conservative, often sided with liberal justices during the Supreme Court's last term.

The president, meanwhile, accused the media of trying to influence Kavanaugh. He also went on to say that Kavanaugh should go on the offensive and take on the media for false statements.

""Brett Kavanaugh should start suing people for libel, or the Justice Department should come to his rescue. The lies being told about him are unbelievable. False Accusations without recrimination. When does it stop? They are trying to influence his opinions. Can’t let that happen!"" he tweeted.

Grassley sent several criminal referrals to the Justice Department related to alleged lies submitted to Senate investigators during Kavanaugh's confirmation process -- which could be what the president meant when he wrote Sunday that the DOJ ""should come to [Kavanuagh's] rescue.""

One of those referrals was for now-disgraced attorney Michael Avenatti and one of his clients, Julie Swetnick, regarding a potential ""conspiracy"" to provide false statements to Congress and obstruct its investigation. Swetnick's credibility took a hit as she changed her story about Kavanaugh's purported gang-rape trains, and her ex-boyfriend went public to say she was known for ""exaggerating everything.""

Swetnick and Ramirez were just two of several women who had accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct during his confirmation process. Christine Blasey Ford notably testified that Kavanaugh attempted to sexually assault her at a party when they were teens, and dubiously asserted that the memory was ""indelible"" in her ""hippocampus"" -- although no witnesses could corroborate her ever-changing story -- even her close lifelong friend, Leland Keyser, who Ford said had attended the party.

Keyser, according to the Times reporters' new book, did not believe Ford's story -- and refused to change her mind, despite pressure from progressive activists and Ford's friends.

""It just didn't make any sense,"" Keyser said, referring to Ford's explanation of how she was assaulted at a party that Keyser attended, but could not recall how she got home.

Ford's attorney, Debra Katz, was quoted in a new book as saying that Ford was motivated to come forward in part by a desire to tag Kavanaugh's reputation with an ""asterisk"" before he could start ruling on abortion-related cases.

We all know that.

That is not an indictment of all politicians—it’s simply part of the game.

It’s our job, as informed citizens, to figure out the truth. And that’s where journalists and the media come in. They are supposed to help us ferret out fact from fiction. So when they get a fact wrong, that’s bad.

When they get a fact wrong, know it’s wrong, and don’t correct it, that’s worse. That’s not getting a fact wrong; that’s a lie. And that’s journalistic malfeasance.

The best (or maybe worst) example of this followed a presidential press conference at Trump Tower on Tuesday, August 15, 2017.

You remember what happened that previous weekend: A group of white supremacists held a “white pride” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. The ostensible reason was to protest the removal of a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee.

An Antifa group showed up to counter-protest. The mayor and the police were totally unprepared to deal with the violence that ensued. Tragically, a young woman, Heather Heyer, was run over and killed by a neo-Nazi.

The press conference itself was raucous. The media was antagonistic. The president was combative.

Out of it all, one phrase eclipsed the thousands of words exchanged: The media reported that President Trump described neo-Nazis as “very fine people.”

Only, he didn’t. In fact, he didn’t even hint at it. Just the opposite: he condemned the neo-Nazis in no uncertain terms. So then, who were the “fine people” he mentioned?

The answer: He was referring to another group of Charlottesville demonstrators who came out that weekend—protestors who wanted the Robert E. Lee statue removed and protestors who wanted to keep the statue and restore the park’s original name.

This is what President Trump said about those peaceful protestors: “You also had some very fine people on both sides. . . . You had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down of—to them—a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name.”

A few moments later, in case there would be any misunderstanding, he makes his meaning even more explicit. “…I’m not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists. They should be condemned totally.”

Lest you have any doubts that good people were in Charlottesville to protest the removal of the Robert E. Lee statue, the New York Times confirmed it in a story they published the next day, August 16.

“’Good people can go to Charlottesville,’ said Michelle Piercy, a night shift worker at a Wichita, Kansas retirement home, who drove all night with a conservative group that opposed the planned removal of a statue of the Confederate general Robert E. Lee. After listening to Mr. Trump on Tuesday, she said it was as if he had channeled her and her friends… who had no interest in standing with Nazis or white supremacists…”

There’s another simple test that we can employ to prove that the president was not referring to the neo-Nazis as “fine people.” It’s so obvious, it’s painful to mention: The president’s daughter and son-in-law are Orthodox Jews. His grandchildren are Jewish.

And if that is still not enough to convince you, how about this: Does anyone believe that Donald Trump thinks there are “good” Antifa, the leftist thugs who were counter-protesting the neo-Nazi thugs? After all, if those two groups were the only ones involved, and there were “fine people on both sides,” that means the president believed that there were fine Antifa people.

Even MSNBC should have found that hard to swallow.

Again, the “very fine people on both sides” President Trump described at the press conference were the people who wanted to remove the Robert E. Lee statue and the people who wanted to keep it. Both of these groups were non-violent protesters—fine people with very different ideological views.

The scandal of Charlottesville is not what President Trump said about neo-Nazis. It’s what the media said President Trump said about neo-Nazis. It’s a scandal because news reporting is supposed to be about gathering facts, not promoting an agenda.

In Charlottesville, they got it exactly backwards. We have been living with the consequences ever since.

Plainly put: ABC, CBS, NBC, NPR, the New York Times, the Washington Post and the others spread a malicious lie that has poisoned our national dialogue.

They should apologize to the American people for what they have done.

Don’t hold your breath.

Actually, I have a better idea. Let out a big sigh of relief.

Because now you know the truth.

It may encourage Americans to follow the news more closely, it may prompt them to stay further away. It could derail Trump's re-election bid or provide his supporters with an energizing rallying cry. Certainly Trump's team is hoping for the latter, considering that Trump's 2020 campaign manager, Bradley Parscale, tweeted, ""Democrats have officially paved the way for a @realDonaldTrump landslide victory. The witch-hunt continues,"" which feels like a stretch considering Trump comfortably lost the popular vote and his Electoral College victory margin ranked 46th of 58 US elections

Regardless of Parscale's misplaced bravado, the real issue isn't what happens to Trump anyway. It's what happens to the nearly 63 million people who voted for him.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is correct: ""No one is above the law."" But for many who voted for Trump in the first place, this development isn't about the law, the Constitution or the sanctity of democracy. It is about winning. And if being willfully ignorant of Trump's alleged misdeeds helps Republicans win, they'll take it.

AMY GOODMAN : This is ███ ! , democracynow.org , The War and Peace Report . I ’ m Amy Goodman . In the United States , protests broke out around the country Monday as the 538 electors of the Electoral College met in their respective state capitals and decisively voted to make Donald Trump the 45th president of the United States . Trump received 304 votes , well over the threshold of 270 necessary for him to become the next president . His Democratic challenger , Hillary Clinton , won 227 votes . Trump is scheduled to be sworn in as president one month from today , on January 20th .
We spend the rest of the hour with Robert Reich , who served as labor secretary under President Bill Clinton . Reich , who now teaches at University of California , Berkeley , has emerged as one of Donald Trump ’ s most vocal critics . He recently wrote a piece headlined “ Trump ’ s Seven Techniques to Control the Media. ” I interviewed him yesterday and began by asking him what he thinks Donald Trump represents .
ROBERT REICH : Well , Donald Trump , besides , in my view , not being qualified to be president and , actually , on the campaign trail and even after the campaign was over advocating , legitimizing and enabling people to be quite hateful in America , if they were already leaning in that direction , Donald Trump also does not have any understanding of a democracy . And if anything , his leanings are toward tyranny . And by “ tyranny , ” I simply mean someone who absorbs the trappings of power but doesn ’ t understand that he , in a democracy , is a public servant . He is working for us ; we are not working for him . And in many ways , Donald Trump seems to be indifferent , at best , to the democratic process . He , for example , treats the press—and we need a free and independent press . Every democracy requires a free and independent press to report on what the powerful are doing . Trump continues to denigrate the press and to bypass it whenever he has any opportunity .
AMY GOODMAN : So , specifically get into this issue of the press . You wrote a fascinating piece saying , as you ’ ve said now , “ Democracy depends on an independent press , which is why all tyrants try to squelch it . They use seven techniques that , worryingly , President-elect Donald Trump already employs. ” Go in detail into these seven techniques , beginning with berating the media .
ROBERT REICH : Donald Trump has , almost from the beginning of his campaign , and certainly in the—and he ’ s continued it—in the post-election period , to denigrate and berate the media . He holds rallies , and he talks about the dishonest media . He uses adjectives like “ scum ” and “ scoundrel ” to describe the media . He picks out individual members of the press who have criticized him , and talks about them in very critical terms or mocks them . This is not the habit of a democratic—democratically elected president . We ’ ve had presidents who have been upset by particular reports . Harry Truman , for example , was very upset when his—when the media reported—a particular reporter criticized his daughter ’ s singing , and he had some quite stern words about that reporter . But we ’ ve never before had a president or president-elect who has taken the media on so directly and so negatively and tried to plant in the public ’ s mind—and I think this is the real danger , Amy—trying to plant in the public ’ s mind the notion that the press is the enemy itself . If the public doesn ’ t believe in a free and independent press , then we ’ re in a kind of fact-free universe , because—and also a president is immune from criticism . And I think that ’ s , consciously or not , what Donald Trump is seeking .
AMY GOODMAN : Your number two point of techniques that Trump has used to control the media , “ Blacklist critical media. ” During the campaign , he blacklisted news outlets , like pulling The Washington Post 's credentials . I was surprised at the time that other reporters on the campaign trail covering Trump did n't jointly say , “ If they are not allowed in , we will not report on you . We will not go in , either . ”
ROBERT REICH : I was surprised , as well . And what the media certainly needs to do is stand up for itself and stand up for other members of the media . Now , I understand media—you know , the situation today is very competitive , and there are a lot of media outlets that are worried about losing readership and so forth . But it is very important for the media to stand for a free and independent media . He ’ s announced , for example , that his White House press room , when and if he ever has a news conference , will be—no longer be assigned . The media will no longer be assigned of seats . They will be—they will actually be assigned—those seats will be assigned by the White House press room , not by the media who cover the White House . This may seem like a small detail .
AMY GOODMAN : You ’ re saying by Trump ’ s people . No , it ’ s not a small detail at all , but you ’ re saying by Trump ’ s detail—
ROBERT REICH : Exactly . Instead the White House Press Association , Trump ’ s own office , his own detail , will be assigning those seats . And there , again , is a dangerous precedent , in terms of undermining the freedom and the independence of the press . Donald Trump looks at the press the same way he looks at everything else , “ the art of the deal. ” If he can strike a deal that will give the press something , or a particular member of the press or particular newspaper or news outlet an advantage , then he expects something in return , in terms of favorable coverage . But that ’ s not the way it ’ s supposed to work in the United States or in any democracy . That ’ s why we have a strict demarcation between the press and those in power .
AMY GOODMAN : Number three in your list of seven techniques to control the media , “ Turning the public against the media. ” I want to go to a clip of Donald Trump . DONALD TRUMP : You know my opinion of the media . It ’ s very low . … The press are liars . They ’ re terrible people . … And the media—look at all those people back there : scavengers . They ’ re like scavengers . … Show 'em the crowd , press . Show ’ em the crowd . Show ’ em the crowd . Look , they 're not turning the cameras . They don ’ t even turn the cameras . They don ’ t even turn the cameras , because , you know what , they ’ re very dishonest people . … Disgusting reporters , horrible people . Sure , some are nice . … They ’ re scum , absolute scum . Remember that . Scum .
AMY GOODMAN : So you have Trump referring to the media as “ lying , ” “ dishonest , ” “ disgusting , ” “ scum. ” And then you point out , for example , questioning the press ’ s motives , like talking about The Washington Post ’ s publisher , Jeff Bezos , head of Amazon . Talk about that .
ROBERT REICH : Again , this is unprecedented . We have a president-elect of the United States who comes up with ulterior motives for why a major news outlet , like The Washington Post , might be critical of him . He says Jeff Bezos , who is the publisher of The Washington Post , also from Amazon , is somehow worried about an antitrust action and therefore doesn ’ t want Trump to be president or didn ’ t want Trump to be president , is worried about Trump . This finding of ulterior motives , of assigning particular strange and irrelevant reasons why an outpost of the press might actually be criticizing Donald Trump is an effort , it seems to me , to undermine the credibility of the press , to cause the public to doubt what they are reading .
And Donald Trump , remember , lives in a fact-free universe . This is somebody who , even after the election , has said that , for example , he won by a landslide , when we know that he won—he didn ’ t win by a landslide ; in fact , Hillary Clinton came out with almost 3 million more votes , popular votes , than Donald Trump . He says there was massive voter fraud . We know there—there was no evidence of massive voter fraud . He says that the homicide rate is up 45 percent . We know that the homicide rate is actually down 50 percent . But if in a fact-free world , unless the free press , unless we have a media that is capable of correcting the record , then we have a president who can say almost anything to justify whatever he wants to do . That , again , is a very , very dangerous situation in a democracy .
AMY GOODMAN : As you point out , you said that Jeffrey Bezos , the publisher of The Washington Post , the founder of Amazon—Donald Trump said The Washington Post wrote negative things about him because Bezos , quote , “ thinks I would go after him for antitrust . ”
ROBERT REICH : When Donald Trump goes after Jeffrey Bezos , the publisher of The Washington Post , because of some—some notion that Amazon and Bezos are worried about a possible antitrust action that Trump might inspire , that is designed to undermine the credibility , in the public ’ s mind , of anything that The Washington Post might publish . It is an absurd allegation . There is no reason to believe that the Post 's reporting turns upon Jeff Bezos 's concern about Amazon and any antitrust issues . But , you see , by creating this kind of conspiracy theory or this kind of paranoid notion about the press and planting it in the public ’ s mind , the public , or at least a portion of the public , is led to think that anything that The Washington Post , or another paper whose credibility the president-elect tries to undermine , says is [ not ] justified or is [ not ] true . And again , that is terribly dangerous in a democracy .
AMY GOODMAN : Or he might be threatening the reverse . By saying that , he ’ s saying , “ I could go after him on issues of antitrust . ”
ROBERT REICH : Absolutely . He ’ s signaling to the press that he also has the power , whether it ’ s antitrust or it is the IRS or the FBI or whatever , whatever he is going to be directly or indirectly in command of , he is also signaling to the press that he has that kind of power .
AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to read to you something from Politico . It says , “ Donald Trump ’ s campaign struck a deal with Sinclair Broadcast Group during the campaign to try and secure better media coverage , his son-in-law Jared Kushner told business executives Friday in Manhattan . Kushner said the agreement with Sinclair , which owns television stations across the country in many swing states and often packages news for their affiliates to run , gave them more access to Trump and the campaign , according to six people who heard his remarks . In exchange , Sinclair would broadcast their Trump interviews across the country without commentary , Kushner said. ” Your concerns about this , Robert Reich ?
ROBERT REICH : Well , every president in every press room in every White House does make tacit—has tacit understandings with the press . You know , you get this interview with the president if—and it will be an exclusive interview , but—and we ’ re not going to allow anybody else to have that interview , but you ’ ve got to—you ’ ve got to give him that time to say his piece . That ’ s not unusual . What ’ s very unusual , though , is when a White House strikes a deal with a news outlet not to comment on what the president might be saying at a rally or any other event . That basically is a gag order . I mean , that is an agreement by the press not to have an opinion , not to express itself , not to point out to the public anything , not to even provide any facts to the public that might be important in terms of understanding the context of a presidential event or what a president says . That , again , is terribly dangerous in a democracy . It actually creates—it undermines the independence and the freedom of the press .
AMY GOODMAN : In number four of “ Trump ’ s Seven Techniques to Control the Media , ” you talk about condemning satirical or critical comments . I wanted to go to a clip of Saturday Night Live . DONALD TRUMP : [ played by Alec Baldwin ] Kellyanne , I just retweeted the best tweet . I mean , wow , what a great , smart tweet . SECURITY ADVISER 1 : [ played by Kenan Thompson ] Mr. Trump , we ’ re in a security briefing . DONALD TRUMP : I know , but this could not wait . It was from a young man named Seth . He ’ s 16 . He ’ s in high school , and I really did retweet him . Seriously , this is real . KELLYANNE CONWAY : [ played by Kate McKinnon ] He really did do this . SECURITY ADVISER 1 : Well , sir , you ’ re the president-elect , so I guess you can do whatever you want , but we ’ d really like to fill you in on Syria . DONALD TRUMP : God , Seth seems so cool . His Twitter bio says he wants to make America great again . SECURITY ADVISER 2 : [ played by Alex Moffat ] That is cool , sir . DONALD TRUMP : It also says he loves the Anaheim Ducks . KELLYANNE CONWAY : OK , see , there is a reason , actually , that Donald tweets so much . He does it to distract the media from his business conflicts and all the very scary people in his Cabinet . SECURITY ADVISER 1 : Oh , that does make sense . SECURITY ADVISER 2 : Very clever , sir . DONALD TRUMP : Actually , that ’ s not why I do it . I do it because my brain is bad .
AMY GOODMAN : That , of course , Alec Baldwin playing Donald Trump , as he continues to do now after the election , as he did before . There are many who felt if this had started earlier on , that Trump never would have made it to this point , or perhaps if Jon Stewart was still doing The Daily Show or Stephen Colbert still on Comedy Central . But this issue of satire and Donald Trump tweeting , after that—after the scene we just played , Trump tweeting , “ It is a totally one-sided , biased show—nothing funny at all . Equal time for us ? ” How serious this is , Robert Reich .
ROBERT REICH : Well , on one level , it simply reveals a very thin-skinned and vindictive person on the part of Donald Trump , who doesn ’ t have any sense of humor . But on a deeper level , there are some real dangers here , because a president , an administration , particularly when the administration and Congress are of the same party , does have some power , in terms of the Federal Communications Commission and other agencies , that could make it difficult for a particular broadcaster to function . And by saying “ equal time for our side , ” that ’ s a kind of ironic comment , because the equal time rule by the FCC is gone . Donald Trump really dominated all of the news coverage during the campaign , was given free time by the media .
Satire also is probably one of the most effective means of criticizing any—any person in power , whether that person is elected or is a—just takes power . Traditionally , through time , satire has been incredibly useful and important . To criticize people who are using satire , again , in a very , very fundamental way , turns the public—potentially turns the public against these individuals . Donald Trump has tweeted against Alec Baldwin specifically and personally . And those personal tweets could potentially have some damage . I do know that people who have criticized Donald Trump in various ways , and then Donald Trump has tweeted against them , have , in turn , received threats , including death threats , from some of Trump ’ s followers . We don ’ t want to have in this country that kind of chilling effect on free speech or on satire or any form of free speech .
AMY GOODMAN : We ’ ll be back with UC Berkeley professor Robert Reich , former labor secretary under President Clinton , in a minute .
AMY GOODMAN : “ Natural Blue ” by Julie Byrne , here on ███ ! , democracynow.org , The War and Peace Report . We are speaking to former Labor Secretary Robert Reich , who recently wrote a piece headlined “ Trump ’ s Seven Techniques to Control the Media. ” I asked him about Donald Trump ’ s response to what happened when Vice President-elect Mike Pence attended the Broadway hit Hamilton shortly after the election . At the end of the show , actor Brandon Victor Dixon , who plays Aaron Burr , read a message for Pence from the stage .
BRANDON VICTOR DIXON : Vice President-elect Pence , we welcome you , and we truly thank you for joining us here at Hamilton : An American Musical . We really do . We , sir , we , are of the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us , our planet , our children , our parents , or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights , sir . But we truly hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and to work on behalf of all of us . All of us .
AMY GOODMAN : Donald Trump responded to the Hamilton message by tweeting , “ The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man , Mike Pence . Apologize ! ” I asked former Labor Secretary Robert Reich to respond .
ROBERT REICH : There was nothing about that note , as I read about it and read the content of that note , that was harassing . In fact , it was very dignified , very modest . It simply expressed the cast ’ s hope , because the cast of that Broadway show is very diverse , multiracial , multiethnic , their hope that the Trump administration would be sensitive to their concerns about not being hateful and not promoting racism . And for Donald Trump to jump on that cast and to say that they owe Michael Pence an apology and that this was in some way inappropriate also has a potential to chill freedom of speech .
If any other set of performers want to say something that is slightly critical , or at least signal their discontent in some way with the Trump administration , are they going to be faced with a deluge of similar tweets or similar criticisms ? And what is the consequence of those tweets and criticisms not only in terms of audiences in the future—I don ’ t think there ’ s any problem of Hamilton getting a very , very large audience , but what about playwrights and casts and producers that are struggling to attract audiences or are worried about—even about threats that may come back to them because of Donald Trump ’ s outrage ? You see how delicate this all is , Amy .
Our freedom of the press depends on a lot of tacit norms and understandings between people in power—the president , a president-elect—and the public at large and the press itself . The press is called the fourth estate . It ’ s called the fourth estate because it has almost governmental functions , in terms of being outside the government but being able to criticize what is happening in the government , so the public is aware of potential problems . Without that freedom of the press , as the framers of the Constitution understood , we can not have a fully functioning democracy .
AMY GOODMAN : Your number five in “ Trump ’ s Seven Techniques to Control the Media ” is threatening the media directly , threatening to sue . For example , what The New York Times wrote about him when it came to his tax returns and when it came , as well , to accusations that women made of him directly assaulting them .
ROBERT REICH : Donald Trump ’ s mentor for many years , when he was a younger man , was a fellow named Roy Cohn , a lawyer in New York who was also an assistant—had been an assistant to Senator Joe McCarthy during the—McCarthy ’ s witch hunts , communist witch hunts , in the 1950s . What Roy Cohn did always , over and over again , was sue people , issued lawsuits , libelous lawsuits often , when there was anything in the paper that was critical of Roy Cohn or his clients . Donald Trump apparently internalized it and has a history of mounting lawsuits .
But when you are a president-elect or when you ’ re a candidate , and certainly when you ’ re president , you can not go around trying to intimidate the press and issuing lawsuits or threatening lawsuits because they say something that you don ’ t like about them . And this is what Trump did during the campaign . He also has threatened to expand the libel laws , making it easier , he says , for somebody like him to sue the media . And you , again—presumably , that lawsuit would be based upon something that the media reported that he did not like to be reported , didn ’ t want to be reported . Again , a very , very dangerous threat .
AMY GOODMAN : Number six is limiting media access . You point out Trump hasn ’ t had a news conference since July , when he famously called on Russia to hack Hillary Clinton ’ s email . Let ’ s take a listen . DONALD TRUMP : Russia , if you ’ re listening , I hope you ’ re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing . I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press .
AMY GOODMAN : So that ’ s Donald Trump at his last news conference , and he hasn ’ t held one since . He ’ s also said that , as president , he won ’ t necessarily be having daily press briefings—you know , his press secretary . But you talk out—about how he ’ s blocked the media from traveling with him . You talk about his first conversation with Putin , where it actually first was reported . It wasn ’ t in the United States .
ROBERT REICH : Yes , it ’ s interesting and indicative that that first conversation with Putin , which took place right after he was elected , was reported by the Kremlin first , not by any United States media . Donald Trump doesn ’ t like the media . He doesn ’ t want to be confronted by the media . He doesn ’ t want to have news conferences . Three days after he was elected , Barack Obama had his first news conference . Three days after he was elected and the Supreme Court decided that election , George W. Bush had his first news conference . Donald Trump has not had a news conference since July . He hasn ’ t had any news conference since he was elected .
You see , what he wants to avoid here is being ganged up on . He is desperately afraid that there might be a variety of questions coming from various news organizations about the same set of issues , and that would make him look and feel less powerful . And so , like many—and I use this word advisedly—many dictators or tyrants in history , who don ’ t want to have news conferences , they don ’ t want to be bombarded with questions from the press , Donald Trump is avoiding the possibility that he will have many different news outlets asking him and pummeling him with questions . He doesn ’ t want that possibility .
AMY GOODMAN : And finally , you talk about bypassing the media and communicating with the public directly , as he does with tweets , as he does with his rallies , which he seems to be continuing—in fact , just this past weekend , another victory rally . I wanted to play a clip . PRESIDENT-ELECT DONALD TRUMP : Michelle Obama said yesterday that there ’ s no hope . But I assume she was talking about the past , not the future , because , I ’ m telling you , we have tremendous hope .
AMY GOODMAN : That was Donald Trump this weekend at yet another victory rally , which he used to attack Michelle Obama , the first lady . Robert Reich ?

AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I’m Amy Goodman. In the United States, protests broke out around the country Monday as the 538 electors of the Electoral College met in their respective state capitals and decisively voted to make Donald Trump the 45th president of the United States. Trump received 304 votes, well over the threshold of 270 necessary for him to become the next president. His Democratic challenger, Hillary Clinton, won 227 votes. Trump is scheduled to be sworn in as president one month from today, on January 20th.

We spend the rest of the hour with Robert Reich, who served as labor secretary under President Bill Clinton. Reich, who now teaches at University of California, Berkeley, has emerged as one of Donald Trump’s most vocal critics. He recently wrote a piece headlined “Trump’s Seven Techniques to Control the Media.” I interviewed him yesterday and began by asking him what he thinks Donald Trump represents.

ROBERT REICH: Well, Donald Trump, besides, in my view, not being qualified to be president and, actually, on the campaign trail and even after the campaign was over advocating, legitimizing and enabling people to be quite hateful in America, if they were already leaning in that direction, Donald Trump also does not have any understanding of a democracy. And if anything, his leanings are toward tyranny. And by “tyranny,” I simply mean someone who absorbs the trappings of power but doesn’t understand that he, in a democracy, is a public servant. He is working for us; we are not working for him. And in many ways, Donald Trump seems to be indifferent, at best, to the democratic process. He, for example, treats the press—and we need a free and independent press. Every democracy requires a free and independent press to report on what the powerful are doing. Trump continues to denigrate the press and to bypass it whenever he has any opportunity.

AMY GOODMAN: So, specifically get into this issue of the press. You wrote a fascinating piece saying, as you’ve said now, “Democracy depends on an independent press, which is why all tyrants try to squelch it. They use seven techniques that, worryingly, President-elect Donald Trump already employs.” Go in detail into these seven techniques, beginning with berating the media.

ROBERT REICH: Donald Trump has, almost from the beginning of his campaign, and certainly in the—and he’s continued it—in the post-election period, to denigrate and berate the media. He holds rallies, and he talks about the dishonest media. He uses adjectives like “scum” and “scoundrel” to describe the media. He picks out individual members of the press who have criticized him, and talks about them in very critical terms or mocks them. This is not the habit of a democratic—democratically elected president. We’ve had presidents who have been upset by particular reports. Harry Truman, for example, was very upset when his—when the media reported—a particular reporter criticized his daughter’s singing, and he had some quite stern words about that reporter. But we’ve never before had a president or president-elect who has taken the media on so directly and so negatively and tried to plant in the public’s mind—and I think this is the real danger, Amy—trying to plant in the public’s mind the notion that the press is the enemy itself. If the public doesn’t believe in a free and independent press, then we’re in a kind of fact-free universe, because—and also a president is immune from criticism. And I think that’s, consciously or not, what Donald Trump is seeking.

AMY GOODMAN: Your number two point of techniques that Trump has used to control the media, “Blacklist critical media.” During the campaign, he blacklisted news outlets, like pulling The Washington Post's credentials. I was surprised at the time that other reporters on the campaign trail covering Trump didn't jointly say, “If they are not allowed in, we will not report on you. We will not go in, either.”

ROBERT REICH: I was surprised, as well. And what the media certainly needs to do is stand up for itself and stand up for other members of the media. Now, I understand media—you know, the situation today is very competitive, and there are a lot of media outlets that are worried about losing readership and so forth. But it is very important for the media to stand for a free and independent media. He’s announced, for example, that his White House press room, when and if he ever has a news conference, will be—no longer be assigned. The media will no longer be assigned of seats. They will be—they will actually be assigned—those seats will be assigned by the White House press room, not by the media who cover the White House. This may seem like a small detail.

AMY GOODMAN: You’re saying by Trump’s people. No, it’s not a small detail at all, but you’re saying by Trump’s detail—

ROBERT REICH: Yes.

AMY GOODMAN: —and not the White House Press Association.

ROBERT REICH: Exactly. Instead the White House Press Association, Trump’s own office, his own detail, will be assigning those seats. And there, again, is a dangerous precedent, in terms of undermining the freedom and the independence of the press. Donald Trump looks at the press the same way he looks at everything else, “the art of the deal.” If he can strike a deal that will give the press something, or a particular member of the press or particular newspaper or news outlet an advantage, then he expects something in return, in terms of favorable coverage. But that’s not the way it’s supposed to work in the United States or in any democracy. That’s why we have a strict demarcation between the press and those in power.

AMY GOODMAN: Number three in your list of seven techniques to control the media, “Turning the public against the media.” I want to go to a clip of Donald Trump. DONALD TRUMP: You know my opinion of the media. It’s very low. … The press are liars. They’re terrible people. … And the media—look at all those people back there: scavengers. They’re like scavengers. … Show 'em the crowd, press. Show ’em the crowd. Show ’em the crowd. Look, they're not turning the cameras. They don’t even turn the cameras. They don’t even turn the cameras, because, you know what, they’re very dishonest people. … Disgusting reporters, horrible people. Sure, some are nice. … They’re scum, absolute scum. Remember that. Scum.

AMY GOODMAN: So you have Trump referring to the media as “lying,” “dishonest,” “disgusting,” “scum.” And then you point out, for example, questioning the press’s motives, like talking about The Washington Post’s publisher, Jeff Bezos, head of Amazon. Talk about that.

ROBERT REICH: Again, this is unprecedented. We have a president-elect of the United States who comes up with ulterior motives for why a major news outlet, like The Washington Post, might be critical of him. He says Jeff Bezos, who is the publisher of The Washington Post, also from Amazon, is somehow worried about an antitrust action and therefore doesn’t want Trump to be president or didn’t want Trump to be president, is worried about Trump. This finding of ulterior motives, of assigning particular strange and irrelevant reasons why an outpost of the press might actually be criticizing Donald Trump is an effort, it seems to me, to undermine the credibility of the press, to cause the public to doubt what they are reading.

And Donald Trump, remember, lives in a fact-free universe. This is somebody who, even after the election, has said that, for example, he won by a landslide, when we know that he won—he didn’t win by a landslide; in fact, Hillary Clinton came out with almost 3 million more votes, popular votes, than Donald Trump. He says there was massive voter fraud. We know there—there was no evidence of massive voter fraud. He says that the homicide rate is up 45 percent. We know that the homicide rate is actually down 50 percent. But if in a fact-free world, unless the free press, unless we have a media that is capable of correcting the record, then we have a president who can say almost anything to justify whatever he wants to do. That, again, is a very, very dangerous situation in a democracy.

AMY GOODMAN: As you point out, you said that Jeffrey Bezos, the publisher of The Washington Post, the founder of Amazon—Donald Trump said The Washington Post wrote negative things about him because Bezos, quote, “thinks I would go after him for antitrust.”

ROBERT REICH: When Donald Trump goes after Jeffrey Bezos, the publisher of The Washington Post, because of some—some notion that Amazon and Bezos are worried about a possible antitrust action that Trump might inspire, that is designed to undermine the credibility, in the public’s mind, of anything that The Washington Post might publish. It is an absurd allegation. There is no reason to believe that the Post's reporting turns upon Jeff Bezos's concern about Amazon and any antitrust issues. But, you see, by creating this kind of conspiracy theory or this kind of paranoid notion about the press and planting it in the public’s mind, the public, or at least a portion of the public, is led to think that anything that The Washington Post, or another paper whose credibility the president-elect tries to undermine, says is [not] justified or is [not] true. And again, that is terribly dangerous in a democracy.

AMY GOODMAN: Or he might be threatening the reverse. By saying that, he’s saying, “I could go after him on issues of antitrust.”

ROBERT REICH: Absolutely. He’s signaling to the press that he also has the power, whether it’s antitrust or it is the IRS or the FBI or whatever, whatever he is going to be directly or indirectly in command of, he is also signaling to the press that he has that kind of power.

AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to read to you something from Politico. It says, “Donald Trump’s campaign struck a deal with Sinclair Broadcast Group during the campaign to try and secure better media coverage, his son-in-law Jared Kushner told business executives Friday in Manhattan. Kushner said the agreement with Sinclair, which owns television stations across the country in many swing states and often packages news for their affiliates to run, gave them more access to Trump and the campaign, according to six people who heard his remarks. In exchange, Sinclair would broadcast their Trump interviews across the country without commentary, Kushner said.” Your concerns about this, Robert Reich?

ROBERT REICH: Well, every president in every press room in every White House does make tacit—has tacit understandings with the press. You know, you get this interview with the president if—and it will be an exclusive interview, but—and we’re not going to allow anybody else to have that interview, but you’ve got to—you’ve got to give him that time to say his piece. That’s not unusual. What’s very unusual, though, is when a White House strikes a deal with a news outlet not to comment on what the president might be saying at a rally or any other event. That basically is a gag order. I mean, that is an agreement by the press not to have an opinion, not to express itself, not to point out to the public anything, not to even provide any facts to the public that might be important in terms of understanding the context of a presidential event or what a president says. That, again, is terribly dangerous in a democracy. It actually creates—it undermines the independence and the freedom of the press.

AMY GOODMAN: In number four of “Trump’s Seven Techniques to Control the Media,” you talk about condemning satirical or critical comments. I wanted to go to a clip of Saturday Night Live. DONALD TRUMP: [played by Alec Baldwin] Kellyanne, I just retweeted the best tweet. I mean, wow, what a great, smart tweet. SECURITY ADVISER 1: [played by Kenan Thompson] Mr. Trump, we’re in a security briefing. DONALD TRUMP: I know, but this could not wait. It was from a young man named Seth. He’s 16. He’s in high school, and I really did retweet him. Seriously, this is real. KELLYANNE CONWAY: [played by Kate McKinnon] He really did do this. SECURITY ADVISER 1: Well, sir, you’re the president-elect, so I guess you can do whatever you want, but we’d really like to fill you in on Syria. DONALD TRUMP: God, Seth seems so cool. His Twitter bio says he wants to make America great again. SECURITY ADVISER 2: [played by Alex Moffat] That is cool, sir. DONALD TRUMP: It also says he loves the Anaheim Ducks. KELLYANNE CONWAY: OK, see, there is a reason, actually, that Donald tweets so much. He does it to distract the media from his business conflicts and all the very scary people in his Cabinet. SECURITY ADVISER 1: Oh, that does make sense. SECURITY ADVISER 2: Very clever, sir. DONALD TRUMP: Actually, that’s not why I do it. I do it because my brain is bad.

AMY GOODMAN: That, of course, Alec Baldwin playing Donald Trump, as he continues to do now after the election, as he did before. There are many who felt if this had started earlier on, that Trump never would have made it to this point, or perhaps if Jon Stewart was still doing The Daily Show or Stephen Colbert still on Comedy Central. But this issue of satire and Donald Trump tweeting, after that—after the scene we just played, Trump tweeting, “It is a totally one-sided, biased show—nothing funny at all. Equal time for us?” How serious this is, Robert Reich.

ROBERT REICH: Well, on one level, it simply reveals a very thin-skinned and vindictive person on the part of Donald Trump, who doesn’t have any sense of humor. But on a deeper level, there are some real dangers here, because a president, an administration, particularly when the administration and Congress are of the same party, does have some power, in terms of the Federal Communications Commission and other agencies, that could make it difficult for a particular broadcaster to function. And by saying “equal time for our side,” that’s a kind of ironic comment, because the equal time rule by the FCC is gone. Donald Trump really dominated all of the news coverage during the campaign, was given free time by the media.

Satire also is probably one of the most effective means of criticizing any—any person in power, whether that person is elected or is a—just takes power. Traditionally, through time, satire has been incredibly useful and important. To criticize people who are using satire, again, in a very, very fundamental way, turns the public—potentially turns the public against these individuals. Donald Trump has tweeted against Alec Baldwin specifically and personally. And those personal tweets could potentially have some damage. I do know that people who have criticized Donald Trump in various ways, and then Donald Trump has tweeted against them, have, in turn, received threats, including death threats, from some of Trump’s followers. We don’t want to have in this country that kind of chilling effect on free speech or on satire or any form of free speech.

AMY GOODMAN: We’ll be back with UC Berkeley professor Robert Reich, former labor secretary under President Clinton, in a minute.

[break]

AMY GOODMAN: “Natural Blue” by Julie Byrne, here on Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. We are speaking to former Labor Secretary Robert Reich, who recently wrote a piece headlined “Trump’s Seven Techniques to Control the Media.” I asked him about Donald Trump’s response to what happened when Vice President-elect Mike Pence attended the Broadway hit Hamilton shortly after the election. At the end of the show, actor Brandon Victor Dixon, who plays Aaron Burr, read a message for Pence from the stage.

BRANDON VICTOR DIXON: Vice President-elect Pence, we welcome you, and we truly thank you for joining us here at Hamilton: An American Musical. We really do. We, sir, we, are of the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights, sir. But we truly hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and to work on behalf of all of us. All of us.

AMY GOODMAN: Donald Trump responded to the Hamilton message by tweeting, “The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize!” I asked former Labor Secretary Robert Reich to respond.

ROBERT REICH: There was nothing about that note, as I read about it and read the content of that note, that was harassing. In fact, it was very dignified, very modest. It simply expressed the cast’s hope, because the cast of that Broadway show is very diverse, multiracial, multiethnic, their hope that the Trump administration would be sensitive to their concerns about not being hateful and not promoting racism. And for Donald Trump to jump on that cast and to say that they owe Michael Pence an apology and that this was in some way inappropriate also has a potential to chill freedom of speech.

If any other set of performers want to say something that is slightly critical, or at least signal their discontent in some way with the Trump administration, are they going to be faced with a deluge of similar tweets or similar criticisms? And what is the consequence of those tweets and criticisms not only in terms of audiences in the future—I don’t think there’s any problem of Hamilton getting a very, very large audience, but what about playwrights and casts and producers that are struggling to attract audiences or are worried about—even about threats that may come back to them because of Donald Trump’s outrage? You see how delicate this all is, Amy.

Our freedom of the press depends on a lot of tacit norms and understandings between people in power—the president, a president-elect—and the public at large and the press itself. The press is called the fourth estate. It’s called the fourth estate because it has almost governmental functions, in terms of being outside the government but being able to criticize what is happening in the government, so the public is aware of potential problems. Without that freedom of the press, as the framers of the Constitution understood, we cannot have a fully functioning democracy.

AMY GOODMAN: Your number five in “Trump’s Seven Techniques to Control the Media” is threatening the media directly, threatening to sue. For example, what The New York Times wrote about him when it came to his tax returns and when it came, as well, to accusations that women made of him directly assaulting them.

ROBERT REICH: Donald Trump’s mentor for many years, when he was a younger man, was a fellow named Roy Cohn, a lawyer in New York who was also an assistant—had been an assistant to Senator Joe McCarthy during the—McCarthy’s witch hunts, communist witch hunts, in the 1950s. What Roy Cohn did always, over and over again, was sue people, issued lawsuits, libelous lawsuits often, when there was anything in the paper that was critical of Roy Cohn or his clients. Donald Trump apparently internalized it and has a history of mounting lawsuits.

But when you are a president-elect or when you’re a candidate, and certainly when you’re president, you cannot go around trying to intimidate the press and issuing lawsuits or threatening lawsuits because they say something that you don’t like about them. And this is what Trump did during the campaign. He also has threatened to expand the libel laws, making it easier, he says, for somebody like him to sue the media. And you, again—presumably, that lawsuit would be based upon something that the media reported that he did not like to be reported, didn’t want to be reported. Again, a very, very dangerous threat.

AMY GOODMAN: Number six is limiting media access. You point out Trump hasn’t had a news conference since July, when he famously called on Russia to hack Hillary Clinton’s email. Let’s take a listen. DONALD TRUMP: Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.

AMY GOODMAN: So that’s Donald Trump at his last news conference, and he hasn’t held one since. He’s also said that, as president, he won’t necessarily be having daily press briefings—you know, his press secretary. But you talk out—about how he’s blocked the media from traveling with him. You talk about his first conversation with Putin, where it actually first was reported. It wasn’t in the United States.

ROBERT REICH: Yes, it’s interesting and indicative that that first conversation with Putin, which took place right after he was elected, was reported by the Kremlin first, not by any United States media. Donald Trump doesn’t like the media. He doesn’t want to be confronted by the media. He doesn’t want to have news conferences. Three days after he was elected, Barack Obama had his first news conference. Three days after he was elected and the Supreme Court decided that election, George W. Bush had his first news conference. Donald Trump has not had a news conference since July. He hasn’t had any news conference since he was elected.

You see, what he wants to avoid here is being ganged up on. He is desperately afraid that there might be a variety of questions coming from various news organizations about the same set of issues, and that would make him look and feel less powerful. And so, like many—and I use this word advisedly—many dictators or tyrants in history, who don’t want to have news conferences, they don’t want to be bombarded with questions from the press, Donald Trump is avoiding the possibility that he will have many different news outlets asking him and pummeling him with questions. He doesn’t want that possibility.

AMY GOODMAN: And finally, you talk about bypassing the media and communicating with the public directly, as he does with tweets, as he does with his rallies, which he seems to be continuing—in fact, just this past weekend, another victory rally. I wanted to play a clip. PRESIDENT-ELECT DONALD TRUMP: Michelle Obama said yesterday that there’s no hope. But I assume she was talking about the past, not the future, because, I’m telling you, we have tremendous hope.

AMY GOODMAN: That was Donald Trump this weekend at yet another victory rally, which he used to attack Michelle Obama, the first lady. Robert Reich?

ROBERT REICH: Donald Trump’s modus operandi seems to be to communicate directly with followers and with the public through tweets and through rallies. And he’s signaled that he wants to continue to use rallies even after January 20th, when he becomes president. The problem for the free press is that the more you have a president who is communicating directly through tweets and rallies, the less able are the press or is the media to be able to intermediate. I mean, the word “media” comes from the term “intermediation,” which is speaking truth to power. It’s actually intermediating between the powerful and the public, so that the powerful can be held accountable, so that they can be asked questions on behalf of the public, so that there can be criticism voiced, where individual members of the public don’t have the power to do that. They are just sort of a very, very large group of individuals who—none of whom has the power to talk back. That’s why the intermediaries, the media, are so important.",www.democracynow.org,left,YnbS5SxcWzwGp6Ie

The spot , “ Coup , ” attacked the whistleblower process as a “ coup. ” It features a clip of Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R-S.C. ) on Fox News claiming that the complaint is based on a hearsay and that it is a “ set up. ” “ It ’ s nothing short of a coup and it must be stopped , ” a narrator says .
“ Our company accepts political and advocacy advertising across the political spectrum , ” a company spokesperson said . “ Advertisers must substantiate all factual claims made in their ads . We can not accept this ad as it contains statements of fact that are not true . ”
The ad also had been targeted to air on Turner Sports , which also is rejecting it .
The spokesperson said that the ad “ contains assertions of fact about the whistleblower complaint that have been refuted by the Intelligence Inspector General . In addition , it is inaccurate to use the word ‘ coup ’ to describe a constitutionally prescribed legal process . ”
The spokesperson said that they did accept an ad from Trump called “ Changing Things ” that was accepted because “ it meets our commercial clearance standards . ”
Meanwhile , Joe Biden ’ s campaign is urging Fox News to follow CNN in rejecting a Trump campaign ad , “ Biden Corruption , ” arguing that it “ states falsely that Vice President Biden offered Ukraine $ 1 billion to fire the prosecutor investigating a company affiliated with his son . ”
“ The allegation of corrupt motive has been demonstrated to be completely false , ” Campaign Manager Greg Schultz wrote in a letter to Fox News General Counsel Lily Chaffee .
“ Though the Trump campaign is prepared to fabricate outright lies , you station ’ s airwaves should not be used to disseminate them . We are putting you on notice about the absolute falsity of the ad ’ s claims , and we expect that you will reject it . ”
Schultz also wrote that it the network does permit the ad , “ you are acting with the understanding that the Trump campaign is using your facilities to mislead your viewers . ”
Schultz attached news stories that have debunked the claims made against Biden .
A Fox News spokesperson said , “ We are not in the business of censoring ads from candidates on either side of the aisle . Vice President Joe Biden has a standing invitation to appear on any of our platforms. ” The network did accept an ad that ran as part of Democrat Tom Steyer ’ s Need to Impeach campaign .

“ CNN is rejecting the ad , as it does not meet our advertising standards , ” a network spokeswoman said . “ Specifically , in addition to disparaging CNN and its journalists , the ad makes assertions that have been proven demonstrably false by various news outlets , including CNN . ”
In the ad , called “ Biden Corruption , ” a narrator says , “ Joe Biden promised Ukraine a billion dollars if they fire the prosecutor investigating his son ’ s company . ”
But Biden had criticized the prosecutor at the center of the claim , Victor Shokin , for not doing enough to fight corruption in the country , and other international leaders and organizations also were calling for the prosecutor to be removed .

Media coverage of the crisis in Puerto Rico has been dismal since the hurricane hit; even when outlets reported on major scandals about the mismanaged recovery, the coverage was negligible and faded quickly.

NEW YORK ( AP ) — Here ’ s a point to ponder : To what extent is Fox News Channel ’ s Tucker Carlson responsible for President Donald Trump stepping away from a potential war with Iran ?
From his prime-time perch on the top-rated cable network , Carlson has advocated restraint in dealing with Iran , and resisted cheerleading the Trump-ordered drone killing of Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani .
Shortly after the story of Iran ’ s counter-attack broke on Tuesday , Carlson hosted a show that mixed coverage of the story as details became known , emphasizing early reports of a lack of American casualties , and interviews with experts on the Middle East . Some of those guests pointed out the dangers of spiraling escalation .

NEW YORK (AP) — Here’s a point to ponder: To what extent is Fox News Channel’s Tucker Carlson responsible for President Donald Trump stepping away from a potential war with Iran?

From his prime-time perch on the top-rated cable network, Carlson has advocated restraint in dealing with Iran, and resisted cheerleading the Trump-ordered drone killing of Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani.

Shortly after the story of Iran’s counter-attack broke on Tuesday, Carlson hosted a show that mixed coverage of the story as details became known, emphasizing early reports of a lack of American casualties, and interviews with experts on the Middle East. Some of those guests pointed out the dangers of spiraling escalation.

“I continue to believe the president doesn’t want a full-blown war,” Carlson said. “Some around him might, but I think most sober people don’t want that.”

Trump, who announced his decision not to retaliate against Iran’s missile strikes in a nationally televised address 14 hours later, told some close to him that he watched Carlson’s show, according to BuzzFeed News. He told confidants in recent days that Carlson’s strong advocacy not to escalate the situation in Iran played a role in his decision-making, two White House officials and Republicans close to the West Wing told The Associated Press on Thursday.

Trump keeps a close eye on how his base responds to policy decisions, feeling their beliefs are often reflected and influenced by Fox News hosts. His Twitter feed reflects how he keeps close tabs on Fox, and he tweeted a link to a Carlson piece on Monday night.

The president often consults with Fox News hosts off-air, including Carlson. Carlson was seen among the president’s entourage this past summer when he visited the demilitarized zone between North Korea and South Korea. He conducted an interview with Trump that was later shown on Fox.

Following Trump’s announcement on Wednesday, Carlson said that “we’re back from the brink.” He played a clip of the president’s speech where he said that a pause in hostilities between Iran and the United States was a very good thing for the world.

“That’s a big claim but in this case it is not an overstatement,” Carlson said.

His show moved on to a new cause, in this case encouraging the U.S. to leave neighboring Iraq.

He was calm on Tuesday’s show, at a time there was breathless coverage elsewhere of the missile attack. A succession of guests threw cold water on the idea of further retaliation. Gil Barndollar of Defense Priorities suggested Americans were kidding themselves if they expected to incite a regime-change movement in Iran. With Kelley Vlahos, executive editor of The American Conservative magazine, they speculated on the role of Democrats and Trump staffers who didn’t have the president’s best interests in mind in advocating war with Iran. Trump was reminded that he was elected on a pledge to get Americans out of foreign entanglements.

A frequent Carlson guest, retired Army Col. Douglas MacGregor, said a war without public support could not succeed. He said further destabilization in the Middle East would have disastrous effects.

“If you destroy Iran, you will get ISIS times one hundred,” he said.

Fox News anchor Bret Baier came on Carlson’s show to suggest that the moment was Trump’s biggest test as a leader.

Carlson’s show contrasted with a more bellicose approach by the Fox personality who followed him on the air, Sean Hannity. Hannity, a more loyal Trump supporter, backed the attack that killed Soleimani. While Hannity didn’t advocate all-out war with Iran, he suggested that nation was about to be hit with the full force of the American military. “You don’t get to do what they did tonight,” Hannity said on Tuesday’s show.

A.J. Bauer, a New York University professor who is an expert on conservative media, said he could not judge what kind of impact Carlson’s program had on Trump’s decision. He noted that it was consistent with other times where Trump had resisted more extensive foreign entanglements.

Instead, Bauer found the different opinions expressed by Hannity and Carlson to exemplify how Fox must step carefully with an audience that reflects conflicting strains within the conservative movement, between a hawkish military approach and an “America first” attitude that resists overseas adventurism.

Yesterday’s story of a National Security Council in “turmoil,” filled with staffers who “struggle to make policy” to fit President Trump’s tweets?

Facebook 's General Counsel Colin Stretch outlined the change in a 12-page letter sent Monday to Republican Sen. John Thune , chairman of the commerce committee , which oversees the Internet and consumer protections .
The move comes less than a week after Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg met with Glenn Beck and more than a dozen other conservative commentators to address concerns stemming from a report in the tech blog Gizmodo . The Gizmodo report , which relied on a single anonymous former Facebook worker with self-described conservative leanings , claimed that Facebook downplays conservative news subjects on its trending feature .
As part of the changes outlined Monday , Facebook will stop looking to news outlets like The Wall Street Journal , Huffington Post and Drudge Report to automatically nominate topics for its trending feature . It also automatically nominates topics based on a spike in user posts about a subject .
`` In our meetings last week , we received feedback that any list — even a good one — inherently raises questions of which publications are included versus which are not , '' said Facebook spokeswoman Jodi Seth . `` Based on this feedback , we felt that the best approach would be to clear up this issue by removing these lists entirely and focus on surfacing the conversation on Facebook . ''
Trending topics are seen on the right side of the screen on computers , or after tapping on the search bar in a mobile app .
As part of its review , Facebook found that members of the team working on trending topics could temporarily suppress topics if news outlets were n't reporting on them enough .
But said it found no evidence of systemic political bias , though it could n't discount that a lone wolf might be able to game its system .
`` It is impossible to fully exclude the possibility that , over the years of the feature 's existence , a specific reviewer took isolated actions with an improper motive , '' it said .
Thune said in a statement he found Facebook 's response `` encouraging '' though it revealed that its trending topics feature `` relied on human judgment , and not just an automated process , more than previously acknowledged . ''
Brent Bozell , the president of the conservative Media Research Center and who attended last week 's meeting , applauded the change .
`` Facebook was relying on a preponderance of liberal and leftist 'news ' organs . By not relying on any specific news outlets , Facebook returns to its neutral roots , '' he said in a statement .","Facebook says it is dropping its reliance on news outlets to help determine what gets posted as a ""trending topic"" on the giant social network, a move adopted after a backlash over a report saying it suppressed conservative views.

As part of the changes outlined Monday, Facebook will stop looking to news outlets like The Wall Street Journal, Huffington Post and Drudge Report to automatically nominate topics for its trending feature. It also automatically nominates topics based on a spike in user posts about a subject.

""In our meetings last week, we received feedback that any list — even a good one — inherently raises questions of which publications are included versus which are not,"" said Facebook spokeswoman Jodi Seth. ""Based on this feedback, we felt that the best approach would be to clear up this issue by removing these lists entirely and focus on surfacing the conversation on Facebook.""

Trending topics are seen on the right side of the screen on computers, or after tapping on the search bar in a mobile app.

As part of its review, Facebook found that members of the team working on trending topics could temporarily suppress topics if news outlets weren't reporting on them enough.

But said it found no evidence of systemic political bias, though it couldn't discount that a lone wolf might be able to game its system.

""It is impossible to fully exclude the possibility that, over the years of the feature's existence, a specific reviewer took isolated actions with an improper motive,"" it said.

Thune said in a statement he found Facebook's response ""encouraging"" though it revealed that its trending topics feature ""relied on human judgment, and not just an automated process, more than previously acknowledged.""

Brent Bozell, the president of the conservative Media Research Center and who attended last week's meeting, applauded the change.

""Facebook was relying on a preponderance of liberal and leftist 'news' organs. By not relying on any specific news outlets, Facebook returns to its neutral roots,"" he said in a statement.",www.foxnews.com,right,4HEUKSrrekceN5AP

The media is sinking to Donald Trump's level.

Reeling from their inability to stop his election, envious of his power to make people believe his most ridiculous statements, and rinsed by a needy mood for self-soothing, the media and other American institutions are greeting the era of Trump by lowering their ethical and professional standards and indulging in attention-seeking hysteria. However cathartic it may be, the effect is suicidal for the media and dangerous for the nation.

Just witness the undignified, stupid press conference that the president-elect gave yesterday. The result was that Trump's denunciation of ""fake news"" and the subsequent media outrage crowded out stories about the conflicts of interest that may bedevil Trump or his nominee for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson.

Here's how it happened.

On Tuesday evening, BuzzFeed published a document that supposedly revealed deep ties between Trump and Russia and included fantastical, salacious details. BuzzFeed's rationale for releasing this document as news is that it was reportedly given to them by someone who claims to be a British ex-spook and worked up this memo as part of an anti-Trump opposition research effort for a Republican rival. The document contained obvious howlers and details that BuzzFeed could have vetted to ascertain how non-credible this ""intelligence"" was. Editor-in-chief Ben Smith ludicrously beat his chest about the ""characteristically ferocious reporting"" his outfit does. And yet the article had to admit that BuzzFeed reporters ""have been investigating various alleged facts in the dossier but have not verified or falsified them.""

The effect of BuzzFeed's item was not that journalists, elected officials, and intelligence agents were sharing a load of ridiculous tosh with each other, but that they were sharing something of indeterminate value. Maybe it's trash, maybe it's the smoking gun. BuzzFeed invited readers to judge for themselves.

The context for this immense error of judgment makes it worse. Earlier in the week, The Wall Street Journal's editor-in-chief Gerard Baker responded to a question about headlines or stories that report on what Trump says without attaching an assessment of its veracity by arguing, ""I think it's then up to the reader to make up their own mind."" Journalists lined up to condemn him on social media and across other news sites.

""Fake news will become more sophisticated,"" Smith warned. ""And powerful filter bubbles will drive competing narratives from parallel universes of facts."" While acknowledging that Trump would drive the news in the U.S., Smith promised BuzzFeed would endeavor to ""[r]eport something nobody else has found or observed, clearly, fairly, and credibly."" It seems clear BuzzFeed didn't do that in this case because the target was Trump. Obviously it would have a higher standard of qualifying or vetting a dossier of unvetted GOP opposition research on Barack Obama.

It's not the first time that a highly regarded media outlet has run with a conspiracy theory that involved Trump and Russia. It's not even the first time one ran after being passed over by other media outlets. Shortly before the election, Slate ran a piece suggesting that Trump maintained a kind of secret digital revolving door with Russia. More skeptical and tech savvy reporters found that the likelier explanation was that it was a chatty email marketing server.

Some commentators have attributed the appearance of the BuzzFeed story to a retaliation campaign against Trump by America's intelligence agencies. If this is true, it's even more dangerous. Elected leaders assert civilian control over the the state. If people in these agencies dislike the president so much, they should resign in protest, not use their offices to inflict damage on him.

Of course it is tempting to play dirty pool with Trump. A journalist who thinks he is halting the rise of fascism in America will of course find plenty of excuses for sinking to Trump's level. Trump lies and enflames all the time. Trump spread the delegitimizing and racist conspiracy theory that his predecessor was born in Kenya. He encouraged his supporters in ""Lock Her Up"" chants against Hillary Clinton, which was both inflammatory and a lie he had no intention of prosecuting.

But our institutions can't temporarily suspend the very standards that grant them credibility and expect to survive.

Besides, it's foolish as a strategy. Trump doesn't just duck under ethical norms in an emergency; he relishes his total freedom from them. His whole persona and affect is one of candor, of lying to you and winking at you even as he demands you believe him. In the weird way humans calculate virtue, this works to Trump's advantage. His dishonesty comes across as authentic and constitutive. The media's dishonesty will come across as hypocritical and treacherous. The dishonesty of the intelligence services might come across as treasonous.

If his adversaries in the press or within the government think they can outlast and outwit him by adopting the shameless ethic of reality TV, they are grievously mistaken. If the Trump era is as bad as his worst critics insist, the most important commodity going forward is personal and professional integrity.

Saunders, Daniel J.

And earlier this week Carlson did the public two important services .
First , he provided a measure of accountability , where virtually no one else would , in savaging “ vulture capitalist ” and GOP mega-donor Paul Singer for what the latter did to the town of Sidney , Nebraska , in 2015 . Singer bought stock in the hunting-and-fishing-gear retailer Cabela ’ s , and from his fresh seat on the company ’ s board he cajoled its management into agreeing on the company ’ s sale to Bass Pro Shops .

Ace of Spades offers a must-read treatment of this story in a post written just after Carlson shined a spotlight on the Singer–Sidney mess , including asking the question why Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse , who seems to pride himself on being a thoughtful , caring Republican , didn ’ t seem to have a problem with the Cabela ’ s sellout ( coinciding , of course , with a max-out donation by Singer to his campaign ) .
But after he was finished with that essential piece of business , Carlson landed an outstanding interview with a reporter for the Nation , a not-particularly-conservative publication . But Aaron Maté had a lot to say that strayed from the last week ’ s D.C. media narrative on Ukraine , which more or less consumed U.S. Sen. John Kennedy ( R-LA ) , who committed the grievous error of basing his public statements on what he thought were established facts .
Specifically , Kennedy had commented that there was evidence the 2016 U.S. presidential election didn ’ t just bear the mark of Russian meddling but that individuals in Ukraine had also left their fingerprints on the process .
This wasn ’ t controversial all that long ago , you know . CBS News , back in 2017 :
It wasn ’ t so much the Clinton campaign , per se , but a Democratic operative working with the Democratic National Committee did reach out to the Ukrainian government in an attempt to get damaging information about the Trump campaign . That operative ’ s name is Alexandra Chalupa , a Ukrainian-American former Clinton White House aide who was tasked with ethnic outreach on behalf of the Democratic Party . As Vogel reported , she knew about Paul Manafort ’ s extensive connections to the pro-Russian regime of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych , and decided to dig deeper into possible connections between Moscow and the Trump campaign . As part of that effort , she discussed Manafort with the high-ranking officials at the Ukrainian embassy in Washington , D.C . The Democratic National Committee denies that it was ever in contact with the Ukrainian government .
Yanukovych was the guy Paul Manafort was working for before President Trump brought him on as his campaign manager , which probably wasn ’ t the best decision he ever made . But the Democrats absolutely reached out to Chalupa in an effort to politically monetize that relationship with Yanukovych ’ s successor Petro Poroshenko against Trump , and when Yanukovych was tossed out of power in 2014 , the regime that followed was , through Chalupa , without question dancing with Hillary Clinton ’ s campaign . Hot Air ’ s Ed Morrissey , writing at the Week back in 2017 , did a good job of chronicling what the Clinton camp was up to with Ukraine , among other things :
Even more to the point , no experienced campaign would allow senior members to meet with a source without ensuring it would be productive first . As an example , recall that the Democrats worked with a foreign government to dig for dirt on Trump , too . Politico ‘ s Kenneth Vogel and David Stern reported in early January that the DNC contacted officials from the Ukrainian government for their own oppo research efforts . These contacts did not involve cut-outs , as Veselnitskaya may or may not have been , but did directly assist in searching for damaging information that could be used in the election . But where Trump ’ s own flesh and blood was involved in clandestine meetings , the DNC was careful to keep Clinton and her family at arm ’ s length , handling the connections to Ukrainian officials through operative Alexandra Chalupa . Chalupa , whose work included engaging with expatriate Democratic voters , suspected Manafort was using his Russian connections to boost Trump . According to Politico , she began coordinating with officials at Ukraine ’ s Washington embassy to expedite her research , in the hopes of provoking Congress into holding a hearing before the election about Russian contact with the Trump campaign .
We could provide a lot more in the way of references proving that Clinton and the Democrats were using Ukrainian sources to get dirt on Trump . And no , it ’ s hardly beyond the pale to describe the Ukrainian cooperation in those efforts as “ meddling . ”
Especially when it has never been proven that the Russians provided WikiLeaks with the Democratic National Committee ’ s emails , which is the central allegation behind the Trump–Russia narrative the Democrats inflicted on the country for two-plus years before it collapsed earlier this year . The only “ evidence ” that has ever been proffered toward that narrative was a judgment by intelligence agencies we now know were compromised by anti-Trump actors both at the top and in middle management , but without any public showing of evidence of Russian hacking . WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has never wavered from his insistence that the DNC emails were not given to him by the Russians , and it ’ s never been proven those emails were hacked rather than leaked .
That last bit is important because it ’ s a bit of accepted wisdom in Washington that has informed a narrative that somehow Trump ’ s election was illegitimate and the product of foreign influence — without which there would be zero basis for the Democrats ’ current impeachment narrative . Fundamentally , this comes down to a familiar refrain : it isn ’ t news when foreign actors help Democrats get elected in American presidential elections ; it ’ s only interesting when there are indications foreigners might not help the Dems . Consider the case of George Nader , for example , which virtually none of the mainstream media organs bothered to cover .
But when Kennedy brought up what was commonly understood back in 2017 , that the Ukrainians were helping the Democrats to expose Manafort as a supposedly Russia-friendly tool for Putin to control Trump , and when he cast it as meddling in the election , something any reasonable person would have to credit as at least a valid take on the situation , he found himself trashed for his trouble .
As Carlson ’ s segment noted , such Establishment notables as Nicolle Wallace and Charlie Sykes , who we are supposed to believe are “ Republicans , ” began casting Kennedy as a Russian asset ( Wallace , whose intellectual candlepower is of a level making it certain she was merely saying what someone at MSNBC told her to say , might be excused for such inanity ; Sykes is less excusable ) . Worse , Sen. Mitt Romney rebuked Kennedy for suggesting Ukraine played a role in the 2016 election .
Of course , there is almost nothing that Mitt Romney isn ’ t capable of turning septic for the Republican Party . He has proven that with perfect regularity since 2006 . The question is when the GOP and the people of Utah will finally flush this excrescent and odious malefactor out of our body politic once and for all .
The Washington media smelled the chum in the water left by the Never Trump crowd , and by Tuesday Kennedy had decided to cut bait on the Ukrainian-meddling narrative . He said he was finished talking about it , which didn ’ t stop some of the same media organs that had covered the story just 24 months before from hounding him about the “ conspiracy theories ” he was supposedly pushing .
If you ’ re reading this and concluding that the entire thing is stupid , congratulations — you ’ re paying attention . But until Carlson came along to bring someone from the Nation of all places to provide some sane analysis to the hysteria , the media narrative assaulting Kennedy was unchallenged .
Kudos to Kennedy for being willing to take the slings and arrows of the spinning liars inside the Beltway , at least for a while , and kudos to Carlson for setting the record straight . There isn ’ t enough actual honesty in any of this impeachment process , with its various clearly mendacious narratives , and when there are people of good faith willing to punch holes in the fetid web of slime woven by the Democrats and their media allies , those of us who care about the truth should stand with them .","Tucker Carlson is rapidly becoming America’s most important television journalist, because Carlson is willing, where no others are, to call out the abject lies emanating from the mainstream Beltway spin machine.

Yanukovych was the guy Paul Manafort was working for before President Trump brought him on as his campaign manager, which probably wasn’t the best decision he ever made. But the Democrats absolutely reached out to Chalupa in an effort to politically monetize that relationship with Yanukovych’s successor Petro Poroshenko against Trump, and when Yanukovych was tossed out of power in 2014, the regime that followed was, through Chalupa, without question dancing with Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Hot Air’s Ed Morrissey, writing at the Week back in 2017, did a good job of chronicling what the Clinton camp was up to with Ukraine, among other things:

Even more to the point, no experienced campaign would allow senior members to meet with a source without ensuring it would be productive first. As an example, recall that the Democrats worked with a foreign government to dig for dirt on Trump, too. Politico‘s Kenneth Vogel and David Stern reported in early January that the DNC contacted officials from the Ukrainian government for their own oppo research efforts. These contacts did not involve cut-outs, as Veselnitskaya may or may not have been, but did directly assist in searching for damaging information that could be used in the election. But where Trump’s own flesh and blood was involved in clandestine meetings, the DNC was careful to keep Clinton and her family at arm’s length, handling the connections to Ukrainian officials through operative Alexandra Chalupa. Chalupa, whose work included engaging with expatriate Democratic voters, suspected Manafort was using his Russian connections to boost Trump. According to Politico, she began coordinating with officials at Ukraine’s Washington embassy to expedite her research, in the hopes of provoking Congress into holding a hearing before the election about Russian contact with the Trump campaign.

We could provide a lot more in the way of references proving that Clinton and the Democrats were using Ukrainian sources to get dirt on Trump. And no, it’s hardly beyond the pale to describe the Ukrainian cooperation in those efforts as “meddling.”

Especially when it has never been proven that the Russians provided WikiLeaks with the Democratic National Committee’s emails, which is the central allegation behind the Trump–Russia narrative the Democrats inflicted on the country for two-plus years before it collapsed earlier this year. The only “evidence” that has ever been proffered toward that narrative was a judgment by intelligence agencies we now know were compromised by anti-Trump actors both at the top and in middle management, but without any public showing of evidence of Russian hacking. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has never wavered from his insistence that the DNC emails were not given to him by the Russians, and it’s never been proven those emails were hacked rather than leaked.

That last bit is important because it’s a bit of accepted wisdom in Washington that has informed a narrative that somehow Trump’s election was illegitimate and the product of foreign influence — without which there would be zero basis for the Democrats’ current impeachment narrative. Fundamentally, this comes down to a familiar refrain: it isn’t news when foreign actors help Democrats get elected in American presidential elections; it’s only interesting when there are indications foreigners might not help the Dems. Consider the case of George Nader, for example, which virtually none of the mainstream media organs bothered to cover.

But when Kennedy brought up what was commonly understood back in 2017, that the Ukrainians were helping the Democrats to expose Manafort as a supposedly Russia-friendly tool for Putin to control Trump, and when he cast it as meddling in the election, something any reasonable person would have to credit as at least a valid take on the situation, he found himself trashed for his trouble.

As Carlson’s segment noted, such Establishment notables as Nicolle Wallace and Charlie Sykes, who we are supposed to believe are “Republicans,” began casting Kennedy as a Russian asset (Wallace, whose intellectual candlepower is of a level making it certain she was merely saying what someone at MSNBC told her to say, might be excused for such inanity; Sykes is less excusable). Worse, Sen. Mitt Romney rebuked Kennedy for suggesting Ukraine played a role in the 2016 election.

Of course, there is almost nothing that Mitt Romney isn’t capable of turning septic for the Republican Party. He has proven that with perfect regularity since 2006. The question is when the GOP and the people of Utah will finally flush this excrescent and odious malefactor out of our body politic once and for all.

The Washington media smelled the chum in the water left by the Never Trump crowd, and by Tuesday Kennedy had decided to cut bait on the Ukrainian-meddling narrative. He said he was finished talking about it, which didn’t stop some of the same media organs that had covered the story just 24 months before from hounding him about the “conspiracy theories” he was supposedly pushing.

If you’re reading this and concluding that the entire thing is stupid, congratulations — you’re paying attention. But until Carlson came along to bring someone from the Nation of all places to provide some sane analysis to the hysteria, the media narrative assaulting Kennedy was unchallenged.

Kudos to Kennedy for being willing to take the slings and arrows of the spinning liars inside the Beltway, at least for a while, and kudos to Carlson for setting the record straight. There isn’t enough actual honesty in any of this impeachment process, with its various clearly mendacious narratives, and when there are people of good faith willing to punch holes in the fetid web of slime woven by the Democrats and their media allies, those of us who care about the truth should stand with them.",www.spectator.org,right,LaPET3qfgVvHDN3e

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Well, don't you love it? Pope Francis is once again rankling conservatives: this time he's taking on guns! The Holy Father's on a pastoral trip in Turran (sic), uh, Turin, and he says people who manufacture guns and weapons and call themselves Christians are hypocrites! That's the pope talking.

He's getting around, making the rounds on the right I'd say, the Holy Father. We'll be right back.

Following a brief commercial break, Matthews turned his evening's discussion panel to the matter of the role that the debate over gun rights might play in the 2016 presidential race, particularly in light of the Dylann Roof's deadly spree shooting last week at Emanuel AME church in Charleston, South Carolina.

At one point in the discussion, Matthews and company discussed how Republicans generally favor waiting periods for obtaining an abortion, but oppose them for purchasing a handgun. That's when Matthews dismissively wondered why in the world anyone would be in such a rush to buy a gun and left-wing panelist David Corn of Mother Jones magazine relished the notion of Republicans having to hit back at a popular pope on the gun rights issue rather than say Hillary Clinton, a safer partisan target:

DAVID CORN: The Republican party wants a waiting period for any woman who wants an abortion, yet they hate waiting periods for guns and they try to fight those things. They try to-- CHRIS MATTHEWS: Who needs a gun that fast? CORN: Well, that's the question. Who needs a gun that fast? I mean, they always come up with arguments. Someone who is in danger, you know, it's the good guy or good gal with a gun myth. And what the pope said was really rather interesting. Because he wasn't talking about gun control, he was talking about guns as an act of violence-- MATTHEWS: How many guns do we have in this country right now? CORN: Several hundred million. And how it is immoral-- MATTHEWS: More guns than people, right, we're like New Zealanders with sheep, only instead of sheep, we have more guns. CORN: Well, I really want to see how Wayne LaPierre and the NRA now have to take on the pope. It's one thing to take on Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama. MATTHEWS: Oh, they'll do it the way Jeb did it the other day. PERRY BACON: Dismiss him completely. MATTHEWS: This isn't, he's out of his lane.

Far be it for Chris Matthews to have any logical consistency in his politics. Back in November 2009, Matthews badgered a Catholic bishop for clergy who dare to tell pro-choice Democratic Catholics that they are morally obligated to oppose abortion.

The story starts with Tom Godat, an electrician who voted for Trump as the “lesser of two evils.” So his disappointment level didn’t have far to drop. Yet we’re told in an omniscient tone that he is “a little embarrassed” about his vote, even though the caption accompanying his photo reads, “Tom Godat has voted for Democrats in the past but now wants to give Trump a chance.” Apparently the caption writer and the reporter didn’t sufficiently collude on the piece.

Emotional testimony: Jon Stewart, first responders, give emotional testimony before Congress on 9/11 victim fund

CLOSE Jon Stewart delivers a statement chiding members of Congress for not showing up to a hearing on reauthorizing the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund. USA TODAY

In response to Stewart's criticism of members of Congress for not initially showing up for the hearing, McConnell added that it ""frequently happens because members have a lot of things going on at the same time.""

Stewart shot back, saying, ""No, Mitch McConnell, I am not bent out of shape! I am in fine shape...I am bent out of shape for them,"" referring to the first responders.

In response to McConnell's comments on the members' absences, Stewart said sarcastically, ""I didn't mean to interrupt them with their JOBS!""

Stewart, the former host of the ""Daily Show,"" then addressed McConnell directly.

“Senator, you're not good at this argument thing. Basically we're saying you love the 9/11 community when they serve your political purposes, but when they’re in urgent need, you slow-walk, you dither. You used it as a political pawn to get other things you want, and you don’t get the job done completely, and your answer to that charge is, ‘Yeah, duh, we’re Congress. That’s how we do.'”

Stewart called on McConnell to meet with the 9/11 community ""tomorrow as soon as possible,"" saying ""you can pass this thing as a standalone bill tomorrow. Meet with them. I'm begging you.""

The reauthorization bill, which currently has 320 bipartisan House cosponsors, is expected to pass the House. It passed the House Judiciary Committee on June 12 and now goes to consideration by the full House. However, it is unclear if it will pass the Republican-controlled Senate. Previous renewal attempts faced opposition from Senate Republicans who objected to the price tag of reauthorization legislation.

Under Bannon’s leadership, Breitbart has championed Trump’s rise while adopting a provocative and combative tone toward the press, the GOP’s congressional leadership and others who have criticized or questioned the nominee.

Bringing Bannon into the Trump tent will almost certainly lead to a new chapter in the fight between Trump and the media, which is already engaged in a fierce debate over how to cover the GOP nominee.

“The press has declared Armageddon on Trump and Trump is responding with Armageddon and all-out warfare,” said Armstrong Williams, a conservative media investor and radio personality who is close friends with Bannon.

Trump benefitted greatly from the media’s wall-to-wall coverage of his campaign during the GOP primaries, with one study finding he’d received $2 billion in free exposure as he ran roughshod over the deepest field of Republicans to ever run for president.



The rise of Trump also boosted the fortunes of media companies, which have enjoyed elevated ratings and web traffic.

More recently, however, the relationship between Trump and the media has soured as his poll numbers have plummeted and television anchors and reporters alike have taken an increasingly skeptical tone in their coverage.

The GOP nominee says he is running against a “crooked media” that he believes is hell-bent on sinking his campaign.

Some of Trump’s conservative allies say the GOP nominee is to blame for the media frenzy and negative coverage that has enveloped him, though even critics of Trump have acknowledged a shift in coverage.

And remember , this is supposed to be a new era , with a four-star general running a much tighter ship .
As a journalist I thrive on being able to find out what ’ s going on behind the scenes . But in this administration I continue to be amazed at how much stuff is whispered to reporters in furtherance of personal agendas .
Anthony Scaramucci , who came in as communications director with loud proclamations about firing leakers , was himself the target of a gusher of leaks after being fired Monday by chief of staff John Kelly . One unnamed White House official told Politico , “ No way could he work with Kelly . His antics over the past week were crazy by any standard. ” An official also described the Mooch as constantly reminding aides in meetings that he wasn ’ t “ one of them . ''
This also speaks to the Beltway ’ s kick- ’ em-when-they ’ re-down culture in which everyone piles on when you ’ re down , even though Scaramucci suffered from self-inflicted wounds . Thus , when Reince Priebus was ousted , someone leaked that President Trump once asked him to come in and kill a fly .
CNN hit Kelly with a rough story on his first day at the White House . Quoting unnamed sources , the network said Kelly , as Homeland Security chief , `` was so upset with how President Donald Trump handled the firing of FBI Director James Comey that Kelly called Comey afterward and said he was considering resigning . ''
It was not clear how serious Kelly was , CNN said , but Comey urged him by phone not to resign . Obviously this may create some awkwardness with his new boss .
In a potentially more serious piece than those involving internal backbiting , the Washington Post reported Monday night that the president “ personally dictated a statement ” about his son and that June 2016 meeting with several Russians .
The statement to the New York Times said that Donald Trump Jr. ( along with Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort ) and the Russian lawyer had “ primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children . ”
That turned out to be so limited as to be misleading , as became clear when the Times obtained more information and Don Jr. had to put out a second statement acknowledging that he ’ d been told the lawyer , Natalia Veselnitskaya , had damaging information on Hillary Clinton that Russia ’ s “ government ” wanted to share with the campaign . This was confirmed when Don Jr. released a series of emails before the Times could publish them .
Kellyanne Conway told `` Special Report '' that Trump said `` he weighed in , like any father would . ''
I ’ ve previously reported that the president ’ s son wanted to make a fuller disclosure at the outset but was essentially overruled . The importance of this leak is that the blame previously fell on senior White House officials who were working on the statement while flying back from the G-20 meeting . Plus , it contradicts an earlier denial from Jay Sekulow , the president ’ s lawyer . Sekulow now says “ the characterizations are misinformed , inaccurate , and not pertinent . ”
The Post even quotes an anonymous presidential adviser as saying , “ Now someone can claim he ’ s the one who attempted to mislead. ” It doesn ’ t exactly sound like this adviser has Trump ’ s best interests at heart .
History would suggest there ’ s no way to stop leaks . Richard Nixon failed , even after creating the “ plumbers ” unit , a covert investigative group whose techniques included burglary .
The big difference in this administration is that the president is often damaged by these leaks and they sometimes include classified information . And there ’ s no sign that these leaks will recede any time soon .","Washington’s leaky culture appears to be unstoppable.

CNN hit Kelly with a rough story on his first day at the White House. Quoting unnamed sources, the network said Kelly, as Homeland Security chief, ""was so upset with how President Donald Trump handled the firing of FBI Director James Comey that Kelly called Comey afterward and said he was considering resigning.""



It was not clear how serious Kelly was, CNN said, but Comey urged him by phone not to resign. Obviously this may create some awkwardness with his new boss.

In a potentially more serious piece than those involving internal backbiting, the Washington Post reported Monday night that the president “personally dictated a statement” about his son and that June 2016 meeting with several Russians.

The statement to the New York Times said that Donald Trump Jr. (along with Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort) and the Russian lawyer had “primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children.”

That turned out to be so limited as to be misleading, as became clear when the Times obtained more information and Don Jr. had to put out a second statement acknowledging that he’d been told the lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, had damaging information on Hillary Clinton that Russia’s “government” wanted to share with the campaign. This was confirmed when Don Jr. released a series of emails before the Times could publish them.

Kellyanne Conway told ""Special Report"" that Trump said ""he weighed in, like any father would.""

I’ve previously reported that the president’s son wanted to make a fuller disclosure at the outset but was essentially overruled. The importance of this leak is that the blame previously fell on senior White House officials who were working on the statement while flying back from the G-20 meeting. Plus, it contradicts an earlier denial from Jay Sekulow, the president’s lawyer. Sekulow now says “the characterizations are misinformed, inaccurate, and not pertinent.”

The Post even quotes an anonymous presidential adviser as saying, “Now someone can claim he’s the one who attempted to mislead.” It doesn’t exactly sound like this adviser has Trump’s best interests at heart.



History would suggest there’s no way to stop leaks. Richard Nixon failed, even after creating the “plumbers” unit, a covert investigative group whose techniques included burglary.

The big difference in this administration is that the president is often damaged by these leaks and they sometimes include classified information. And there’s no sign that these leaks will recede any time soon.",www.foxnews.com,right,efUlcSptG22liD9u

We talk a lot about the left/right divide in political media . But we don ’ t talk enough about the more fundamental divide that precedes and , in some ways , causes it : the interested/uninterested divide .
In All the News That ’ s Fit to Sell , economist James Hamilton writes , “ News emerges not from individuals seeking to improve the functioning of democracy but from readers seeking diversion , reporters forging careers , and owners searching for profits. ” That ’ s a bit more cynical than I ’ d be — a lot of us really do want to improve the functioning of democracy — but as a description of the overall economic system that surrounds our work , it ’ s useful . You can ’ t understand the news without understanding the financial and audience forces that shape it . The first thing to appreciate is that those forces have changed , and changed dramatically , in recent decades .
Consider the options available to eager political news consumers in 1995 . They might have had a hometown paper or two , a handful of radio stations , the three nightly newscasts , the newly launched CNN , and , if they were really hardcore , a couple of magazine subscriptions .
Fast-forward a decade . Those same consumers could fire up Internet Explorer and read almost any newspaper in the country — and most of the major newspapers of the world — online . For political opinion , they had a dizzying array of magazines , any op-ed page they chose , and , all of a sudden , a countless number of blogs . On television , CNN had been joined by Fox News and MSNBC . On radio , satellite began crowding the airwaves with more political commentary . In pockets , the launch of the iPod kicked off the age of podcasting . And the quantity of available political information has only multiplied since then . Never in human history has it been remotely possible to be this politically informed .
In most models of democratic politics , information is the constraint . Voters don ’ t have the time or energy to read thick tomes of political theory and keep themselves updated on every act of Congress , so they ’ re dependent on the political professionals — elected officials , campaign operatives , party staffers , lobbyists , pundits — who do . What follows from this model is tantalizing : If information ceases to be scarce , if it becomes freely and easily available to all , the fundamental problem afflicting democratic systems would be solved .
Over the past decade , the dreams of democratic theorists everywhere actually came true . The internet made information abundant . The rise of online news gave Americans access to more information — vastly more information , orders of magnitude more information — than they had ever had before . And yet surveys showed we weren ’ t , on average , any more politically informed . Nor were we any more involved : Voter participation didn ’ t show a boost from the democratization of political information . Why ?
In the early aughts , Princeton political scientist Markus Prior set out to unravel this apparent paradox . The way he resolved the problem is , in retrospect , obvious .
Yes , there were more cable news channels , but they were dwarfed in number by the channels that had no interest whatsoever in news — channels that served up round-the-clock cooking , home repair , travel , comedy , cartoons , tech , classic films . The key factor now , Prior argued , was not access to political information but interest .
Yes , you could read the political coverage of any newspaper or magazine in the country online , but you could also read so much more nonpolitical coverage . The explosion in political media was more than matched by the explosion in media covering music , television , diets , health , video games , rock climbing , spirituality , celebrity breakups , sports , gardening , cat pictures , genealogical records — really , everything .
The key factor now , Prior argued , was not access to political information but interest in political information . He made his point by comparing it to television . Like the internet , television multiplied the amount of information available to people , and it spread like wildfire . But unlike the internet , television , at least in its early years , offered little choice . You might own a television because you refused to miss I Love Lucy , but if you had the TV on in the evening , you ended up sitting through the news anyway . Similarly , you might subscribe to the newspaper for the sports page , but that meant seeing the political stories on A1 . Politics was bundled alongside everything else , and even the uninterested were pushed to consume political news .
The digital revolution offered access to unimaginably vast vistas of information , but , just as important , it offered access to unimaginably more choice . And that explosion of choice widened that interested/uninterested divide . Greater choices let the devotees learn more and the uninterested know less .
To test this , Prior surveyed more than 2,300 people about their content preferences and their political knowledge . And because he was conducting this survey in 2002 and 2003 , the early years of the internet and still reasonably early for cable , he was able to survey people who had internet access , those who had cable access , those who had both , and those who had neither .
Content preferences — which is to say , how much people wanted to consume political information versus how much they wanted to consume other forms of entertainment — had little effect on the knowledge of those without cable and internet access . Even if you wanted more political information , you didn ’ t have easy access to it , so the interest didn ’ t translate cleanly into information .
What the digital information revolution offered wasn ’ t just more information but more choice of information
But among those with cable and internet access , the difference in political knowledge between those with the highest and lowest interest in cable news was 27 percent . That dwarfed the difference in political knowledge between people with the highest and lowest levels of schooling . “ In a high-choice environment , people ’ s content preferences become better predictors of political learning than even their level of education , ” Prior wrote .
Prior was conducting this research in the early 2000s , before Facebook and Twitter , before mobile internet and YouTube algorithms , before MSNBC ’ s leftward turn , before BuzzFeed and HuffPost , before Breitbart and the alt-right , before ███ . The internet has become much better at learning what we want and giving us more of it since then . The competition for audience , and the threat to journalistic business models , has become much more intense since then . And all of this has changed both how political news is produced and how it ’ s consumed .
In an age of choice , political journalism is a business that serves people interested in political news and that tries to create more people interested in political news . And to be interested in politics is , for most people , to choose a side . How could it be otherwise ? The differences between the parties and their coalitions are profound . They are ideological , geographic , demographic , temperamental . Whether your side wins or loses is a literal matter of life and death — perhaps not for you , but , given the stakes for health insurance and foreign policy , certainly for someone .
In today ’ s media sphere , where the explosion of choices has made it possible to get the political media you really want , it ’ s expressed itself in polarized media that attaches to political identity , conflict , and celebrity . That is to say , it expresses itself in journalism and commentary that is more directly about the question of why your side should win and the other side should lose .
I ’ ve produced a lot of this kind of journalism . I cover politics because I think policy is important , which is to say , because I think who wins and who loses policy fights is important . And , obviously , my views on those questions are rational , judicious , disinterested , and objectively correct . The problem is lots of other people are doing that kind of work , too , and some of them come to different conclusions than I do .
But rather than argue over who ’ s right , I want to step back and look at how a political media system increasingly organized around that axis deepens political identity , hardens polarization , and raises the political stakes .
The simplest measure for assessing political journalism is whether it ’ s giving those who follow it a more accurate understanding of American politics . As one disturbing window into this question , consider a fascinating study published by Douglas Ahler and Gaurav Sood in 2018 .
In it , Ahler and Sood conducted a survey asking people “ to estimate the percentage of Democrats who are black , atheist or agnostic , union members , and gay , lesbian , or bisexual , and the percentage of Republicans who are evangelical , 65 or older , Southern , and earn over $ 250,000 per year. ” They were asking , in other words , how much people thought the composition of the parties fit the caricatures of the parties .
Misperceptions were particularly high when people were asked to describe the other party . Democrats believed 44 percent of Republicans earned more than $ 250,000 a year ; it ’ s actually 2 percent . Republicans believed that 38 percent of Democrats were gay , lesbian , or bisexual ; the correct answer is about 6 percent . Democrats believed that more than four in 10 Republicans are seniors ; in truth , seniors make up about 20 percent of the GOP . Republicans believed that 46 percent of Democrats are black and 44 percent belong to a union ; in reality , about 24 percent of Democrats are black and less than 11 percent belong to a union .
Here ’ s the kicker : As the charts below show , the more political media people consumed , the more mistaken they were , in general , about the other party . This is a damning result : The more political media you absorb , the more warped your perspective of the other side becomes .
The old line on local reporting was “ If it bleeds , it leads. ” For political reporting , the principle is “ If it outrages , it leads. ” And outrage is deeply connected to identity — we are outraged when members of other groups threaten our group and violate our values . As such , polarized media doesn ’ t emphasize commonalities , it weaponizes differences ; it doesn ’ t focus on the best of the other side , it threatens you with the worst .
As that last paragraph suggests , I ’ m about to step into some dangerous territory , so let me say this clearly : I ’ m not asserting moral equivalence , and in the book this article is adapted from , I have much more to say about the ways and reasons the left and the right — including their media spheres — have diverged .
But virtually everyone in political media is competing for audience attention and loyalty amid a cacophony of choices . We all make different decisions about how to compete for that audience , but since we are all trying to attract other human beings , there are certain similarities in our approach .
Historically , not only did the audience have less choice in what media to consume , the media didn ’ t have much information about the audience . The networks had ratings . The newspapers had subscription renewals . Everyone received letters . But that was it .
I used to regularly guest-host on cable news . The emotional rhythm of that workday crested at 4 pm , when the Nielsen numbers came out and everyone stopped to compare how their show did against the competition . If you beat your competitors , you could rest easy . If you didn ’ t , you had to worry . And if you lost a few times in a row , you ’ d start getting calls from upstairs . Maybe your programming should stick closer to the news of the day . Maybe you needed shorter intros , or longer intros , or more guests , or more heat .
Cable news is journalism , but it ’ s also a business . Chris Hayes , who anchors MSNBC ’ s 8 pm newscast and is among the most thoughtful , civic-minded journalists in the industry , referenced a Will Ferrell joke from Anchorman 2 on his podcast , saying , “ What if instead of telling people the things they need to know , we tell them what they want to know ? ” That is , he says , “ the creation story of cable news . ”
“ At some level , ” he continued , “ we ’ re wedding DJs . And the wedding DJ ’ s job is to get you on the floor. ” The point is not that this leaves no room for serious journalism . As Hayes says , there are good wedding DJs and bad wedding DJs , and the work of being a cable news host is making sure you ’ re one of the good ones . But this is the business context in which cable news decisions are made .
Then came the rise of real-time digital analytics . Every digital newsroom in the country , including ███ , subscribes to some service or another that tracks traffic in a gamified , constantly updating interface . The most influential is Chartbeat , which shows you every article on your site , indicates the number of people on each article at any given second , and colors the dots representing those people to tell you how they found the article . Green dots mean they found you through a search engine . Purple dots mean they came from a social network , usually Facebook , Twitter , or Reddit . It ’ s pure pleasure to watch the display for an article you worked hard on fill with dots .
But we don ’ t just want people to read our work . We want people to spread our work — to be so moved by what we wrote or said that they log on to Facebook and share it with their friends or head over to Reddit and try to tell the world . That ’ s how you get those dots to multiply . But people don ’ t share quiet voices . They share loud voices . They share work that moves them , that helps them express to their friends who they are and how they feel . Social platforms are about curating and expressing a public-facing identity . They ’ re about saying , “ I ’ m a person who cares about this , likes that , and loathes this other thing. ” They are about signaling the groups you belong to and , just as important , the groups you don ’ t belong to .
The rise of BuzzFeed made this subtext into text . Its co-founder and CEO , Jonah Peretti , originally built BuzzFeed on the side as a skunkworks for experimenting with how viral content spread online . The answer soon became clear : Identity is the slingshot .
“ A classic early BuzzFeed post , and later video , was ‘ 13 Struggles All Left-Handers Know to Be True , ’ ” Peretti tells me . “ Another early classic was ‘ Signs You Were Raised by Immigrant Parents. ’ That one ’ s a racial identity but also an immigrant identity . ”
There are so many more . One of BuzzFeed ’ s most popular series was “ X Things Only a Y Would Understand. ” A Google search for those keywords brings up articles like “ 14 Things Only Anxious People Will Understand , ” “ 19 Things Only People With Fibromyalgia Will Understand , ” “ 53 Things Only ’ 80s Girls Can Understand , ” “ 30 Things Everyone Who Went to College Will Understand , ” “ 27 Struggles You ’ ll Only Understand If You Were Born Before 1995 , ” “ 38 Things Only Someone Who Was a Scout Would Know , ” “ 19 Comics Only Night Owls Will Understand , ” “ 19 Things You ’ ll Only Understand if You Had Strict Parents , ” “ 18 Photos That Only People Who Had Braces Will Understand . ”
This is identity media in its purest form . Sharing the scouting article says you were a Scout , and you were a serious enough Scout to understand the signifiers and experiences that only Scouts had . To post that article on Facebook is to make a statement about who you are , who your group is , and , just as important , who is excluded .
In political media , identity is affirmed and activated with slightly more oblique headlines . But the underlying dynamic is the same : This public figure that you and everyone in your group loathe said something awful . This poll came out saying you and your group are going to win or , better yet , that your out-group is going to lose . This slashing column explains why you ’ re right about everything and why your opponents are wrong .
A lot of these pieces are accurate , and some of them are genuinely useful . I have written many of them myself , and edited countless more . But cumulatively , it ’ s a sharp change from the days in which most political content people saw was self-consciously trying to avoid offending anyone . The stories that thrive when your business model is a local monopoly that needs a news product that ’ s appealing to every kind of person who might shop at a department store are different from the stories that thrive when your business model is people who strongly agree with your stories sharing them with their friends .
Identities are malleable things . They can be activated or kept dormant , strengthened or weakened , created or left in the void . The flood of identity-oriented content deepens the identities it repeatedly triggers , confirms , or threatens .
Many of us who wrote about politics on the internet before the rise of social media lament the feeling that something has been lost , that a space that once felt fresh and generative now feels toxic and narrow . In her book Trick Mirror , Jia Tolentino offers a description of what changed that feels right to me , which is that social media shifted the “ organizing principle ” of online discourse :
The early internet had been constructed around lines of affinity and openness . But when the internet moved to an organizing principle of opposition , much of what had formerly been surprising and rewarding and curious became tedious , noxious , and grim . This shift partly reflects basic social physics . Having a mutual enemy is a quick way to make a friend—we learn this as early as elementary school—and politically , it ’ s much easier to organize people against something than it is to unite them in an affirmative vision . And , within the economy of attention , conflict always gets more people to look .
When I entered journalism , the term of art for pieces infused with perspective was “ opinion journalism. ” The point of the work was to convey an opinion . Nowadays , I think a lot of it is closer to “ identity journalism ” — the effect of the work , given the social channels through which it ’ s consumed , is to reinforce an identity .
But an identity , once adopted , is harder to change than an opinion . An identity that binds you into a community you care about is costly and painful to abandon , and the mind will go to great lengths to avoid abandoning it . So the more media people see that encourages them to think of themselves as part of a group , and the more they publicly proclaim — through sharing and liking and following and subscribing — that they are part of a group , the deeper that identity roots and the more resistant the underlying views become to change .
Many people worry that modern media generates polarization by locking us into echo chambers . We ’ ve cocooned ourselves into hearing information that only tells us how right we are , and that ’ s making us more extreme .
There is an optimistic theory embedded in this story : If only we crossed the informational aisle , our enmity and polarization would ebb .
Beginning in October 2017 , a group of political scientists and sociologists decided to test this theory . In the largest study of its kind conducted , they paid 1,220 regular Twitter users who identified as either Democrats or Republicans to follow a bot retweeting elected officials , media figures , and opinion leaders from the other side . The participants took regular surveys asking about their views on 10 issues ranging from immigration to government waste to corporate profits to LGBTQ acceptance .
The result of the month-long exposure to popular , authoritative voices from the other side of the aisle was that respondents became more , not less , polarized . “ We find that Republicans who followed a liberal Twitter bot became substantially more conservative posttreatment , ” write the authors . “ Democrats exhibited slight increases in liberal attitudes after following a conservative Twitter bot , although these effects are not statistically significant . ”
The difference between the Democratic and Republican responses is interesting and merits more study . But the key finding is that neither group responded to exposure to the other side by moderating its own views . In both cases , hearing contrary opinions drove partisans not just to a deeper certainty in the rightness of their cause , but to more polarized policy positions — Republicans became more conservative rather than more liberal , and Democrats , if anything happened at all , became more liberal rather than more conservative .
I spoke to Christopher Bail , one of the study ’ s authors and the head of Duke University ’ s Polarization Lab . “ For a long time , people have been assuming that exposing people to opposing views creates the opportunity for moderation , ” he told me . “ If I could humbly claim to figure out one thing , it ’ s that that ’ s not a simple process . If Twitter tweaks its algorithms to put one Republican for every nine Democrats in your Twitter feed , that won ’ t increase moderation . ”
There is evidence that structuring positive , collaborative interactions can promote understanding . But very little in either political media or social media is designed for positive interactions with the other side . Most political media isn ’ t even designed for persuasion . For all the reasons we ’ ve discussed , the bulk of opinionated political media is written for the side that already agrees with the author , and most partisan elected officials are tweeting to their supporters , who follow them and fundraise for them , rather than to their critics , who don ’ t .
When we talk about political media , we tend to cut a sharp line between the political elites who create the media and the audience that consumes it . But that ’ s a mistake . No one consumes more political , and politicized , media than political elites . This is part of the reason political media has an enormous effect on politics , even though only a small fraction of the country regularly consumes it .
Politicians are increasingly addicted to Twitter , with the president being only the most prominent example . Fox News has whipped the Republican Party into a number of government shutdowns , and much of Trump ’ s most offensive rhetoric comes on a direct conveyor belt from conservative media feeding him conspiracies that he transforms into presidential proclamations .
Indeed , the impeachment effort House Democrats launched against Trump stems from Trump believing a set of anti-Biden conspiracies pushed by Breitbart editor-at-large Peter Schweizer and heavily promoted on Fox News . Most Americans had never heard of Hunter Biden , much less followed vague insinuations about Ukrainian prosecutors . But the president was sufficiently persuaded that he threw the weight of his administration into an investigation , setting off a chain of events that changed American political history and further polarized the country .
Politics is , first and foremost , driven by the people who pay the most attention and wield the most power — and those people opt in to extraordinarily politicized media . They then create the political system they perceive .
Journalists are hardly immune to these forces . We become more polarized , and more polarizing , when we start spending our time in polarizing environments . I have seen it in myself , and I have watched it in others : When we ’ re going for retweets , or when our main form of audience feedback is coming from highly partisan social media users , it subtly but importantly warps our news judgment . It changes who we cover and what stories we chase . And when we cover politics in a more polarized way , anticipating or absorbing the tastes of a more polarized audience , we create a more polarized political reality .
The news is supposed to be a mirror held up to the world , but the world is far too vast to fit in our mirror . The fundamental thing the media does all day , every day , is decide what to cover — decide , that is , what is newsworthy .
Here ’ s the dilemma : to decide what to cover is to become the shaper of the news rather than a mirror held up to the news . It makes journalists actors rather than observers . It annihilates our fundamental conception of ourselves . And yet it ’ s the most important decision we make . If we decide to give more coverage to Hillary Clinton ’ s emails than to her policy proposals — which is what we did — then we make her emails more important to the public ’ s understanding of her character and potential presidency than her policy proposals . In doing so , we shape not just the news but the election , and thus the country .
While I ’ m critical of the specific decision my industry made in that case , this problem is inescapable . The news media isn ’ t just an actor in politics . It ’ s arguably the most powerful actor in politics . It ’ s the primary intermediary between what politicians do and what the public knows . The way we try to get around this is by conceptually outsourcing the decisions about what we cover to the idea of newsworthiness . If we simply cover what ’ s newsworthy , then we ’ re not the ones making those decisions — it ’ s the neutral , external judgment of news worthiness that bears responsibility . The problem is that no one , anywhere , has a rigorous definition of newsworthiness , much less a definition that they actually follow .
A simple example comes in the treatment of presidential and pre-presidential rhetoric . On some level , anything that the president says , or that a plausible candidate for president says , is newsworthy . Yet only a small minority of what is said by presidential candidates , or even presidents , gets covered as major news .
When President Obama gave a speech on manufacturing policy at an Ohio steel mill and when Sen. Marco Rubio held a town hall discussing higher education costs in New Hampshire , they struggled to get the press to take notice . Trump , meanwhile , routinely gets cable networks to air his rallies live by lying flagrantly , lobbing racist and sexist insults , and generally behaving outrageously . Whether this is strategy or intuition , the result is the same : Trump hacked the media ’ s true definition of newsworthiness , and it lets him control the agenda . This was true well before he won the presidency — indeed , it might be why he won the presidency .
In their book Identity Crisis , political scientists John Sides , Lynn Vavreck , and Michael Tesler find that “ from May 1 , 2015 , to April 30 , 2016 , Trump ’ s median share of cable news mentions was 52 percent. ” There were 17 Republican candidates running for president , so Trump was getting more than half of all the media coverage , with the other 16 candidates splitting the remainder .
It gets worse . “ Trump received 78 percent of all coverage on CNN between Aug. 24 and Sept. 4 , 2015 , ” and by November 2015 , “ Trump had received more evening network news coverage—234 minutes—than the entire Democratic field . By contrast , Ted Cruz had received seven minutes. ” This was a choice the media made , and not for the best reasons . In February 2016 , for instance , the chair of CBS said of Donald Trump ’ s candidacy , and the ratings it drew , “ it may not be good for America , but it ’ s damn good for CBS . ... It ’ s a terrible thing to say , but bring it on , Donald . Keep going . ”
Sides , Vavreck , and Tesler argue that in a chaotic , crowded primary , the media coverage Trump received was crucial to legitimizing his campaign : “ Republican voters had received no clear signal about who the front-runner was or should be . The resulting uncertainty meant that this signal needed to come from somewhere else . It was news media coverage that would fill this void. ” The coverage of Trump also made it impossible for his challengers to get their messages heard .
As president , his rambling monologues , which are unusually detached from both factual rigor and his administration ’ s policymaking decisions , are treated as worthier of airtime than the more careful , factual , and policy-predictive speeches of his predecessors .
“ Journalism academics have always known that newsworthiness , as the American press defines it , isn ’ t a system with any coherence to it , ” Jay Rosen , a journalism professor at New York University , told me . “ It doesn ’ t make any sense . It ’ s just a list of factors that occasionally come together to produce news . There ’ s no real logic to it , other than it ’ s a list of things that can make something news . The advantage of it is that it leaves maximum leeway for editors to say , ‘ This is news , ’ and , ‘ That ’ s not news , ’ and so it ’ s news if a journalist decides it ’ s news . ”
In practice , judgments of newsworthiness are often contagious ; nothing obscures the fact that a decision is being made quite like everyone else making it , too . In the modern era , a shortcut to newsworthiness is social media virality ; if people are already talking about a story or a tweet , that makes it newsworthy almost by definition .
This can lead the country into odd , angry cul-de-sacs . I remember returning from an offline vacation only to find the entire political media at war over a viral video in which students from Covington Catholic High School wearing MAGA hats appeared to harass Nathan Phillips , a Native American elder playing a drum . In the original video , which took place during a protest at the National Mall in Washington , DC , the teens were seemingly mocking , smirking , and making tomahawk chop motions at Phillips . A longer video muddied the waters , offering evidence that the teens were harassed by members of the fringe Black Israelites group beforehand . Soon enough , the media was filled with takes and counter-takes , and President Trump was weighing in . “ Nick Sandmann and the students of Covington have become symbols of Fake News and how evil it can be , ” he tweeted .
Nick Sandmann and the students of Covington have become symbols of Fake News and how evil it can be . They have captivated the attention of the world , and I know they will use it for the good - maybe even to bring people together . It started off unpleasant , but can end in a dream ! — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) January 22 , 2019
What was striking , walking into this debate without the ( dis ) advantage of being present for its initial escalation , was how angry everyone was over something that objectively didn ’ t matter . How was this newsworthy ?
The answer was that it had been dominating social media all weekend , and that had made it newsworthy . And why had it dominated social media ? Because it was a perfect collision of political identities : MAGA-hatted teenagers against a peaceful , drumming Native American elder . Liberal news outlets turning the country against conservative , Christian children from a religious school . It was an object lesson in how social media ’ s preference for identitarian conflict focuses the media on identitarian conflicts , even when those collisions are almost comically obscure .
These are dynamics that Trump exploits daily . He weaponizes outrageousness , offensiveness , and identity cues to capture a share of political coverage unknown in the modern era . He ’ s shown that in a competitive media environment — particularly one responsive to social platforms — you can dominate the media by lobbing grenades into our deepest social divides .
The media is how most Americans get their information about politics and politicians , and if the media is tilting , or being tilted , toward certain kinds of political stories and figures , then the political system will tilt in that direction , too .
Trump is a product of the tilting , but he is not the first , and he will not be the last . The political media is biased , but not toward the left or right so much as toward loud , outrageous , colorful , inspirational , confrontational . It is biased toward the political stories and figures who activate our identities , because it is biased toward and dependent on the fraction of the country with the most intense political identities .

We talk a lot about the left/right divide in political media. But we don’t talk enough about the more fundamental divide that precedes and, in some ways, causes it: the interested/uninterested divide.

In All the News That’s Fit to Sell, economist James Hamilton writes, “News emerges not from individuals seeking to improve the functioning of democracy but from readers seeking diversion, reporters forging careers, and owners searching for profits.” That’s a bit more cynical than I’d be — a lot of us really do want to improve the functioning of democracy — but as a description of the overall economic system that surrounds our work, it’s useful. You can’t understand the news without understanding the financial and audience forces that shape it. The first thing to appreciate is that those forces have changed, and changed dramatically, in recent decades.

Consider the options available to eager political news consumers in 1995. They might have had a hometown paper or two, a handful of radio stations, the three nightly newscasts, the newly launched CNN, and, if they were really hardcore, a couple of magazine subscriptions.

Fast-forward a decade. Those same consumers could fire up Internet Explorer and read almost any newspaper in the country — and most of the major newspapers of the world — online. For political opinion, they had a dizzying array of magazines, any op-ed page they chose, and, all of a sudden, a countless number of blogs. On television, CNN had been joined by Fox News and MSNBC. On radio, satellite began crowding the airwaves with more political commentary. In pockets, the launch of the iPod kicked off the age of podcasting. And the quantity of available political information has only multiplied since then. Never in human history has it been remotely possible to be this politically informed.

In most models of democratic politics, information is the constraint. Voters don’t have the time or energy to read thick tomes of political theory and keep themselves updated on every act of Congress, so they’re dependent on the political professionals — elected officials, campaign operatives, party staffers, lobbyists, pundits — who do. What follows from this model is tantalizing: If information ceases to be scarce, if it becomes freely and easily available to all, the fundamental problem afflicting democratic systems would be solved.

Over the past decade, the dreams of democratic theorists everywhere actually came true. The internet made information abundant. The rise of online news gave Americans access to more information — vastly more information, orders of magnitude more information — than they had ever had before. And yet surveys showed we weren’t, on average, any more politically informed. Nor were we any more involved: Voter participation didn’t show a boost from the democratization of political information. Why?

How choice changes media

In the early aughts, Princeton political scientist Markus Prior set out to unravel this apparent paradox. The way he resolved the problem is, in retrospect, obvious.

Yes, there were more cable news channels, but they were dwarfed in number by the channels that had no interest whatsoever in news — channels that served up round-the-clock cooking, home repair, travel, comedy, cartoons, tech, classic films. The key factor now, Prior argued, was not access to political information but interest.

Yes, you could read the political coverage of any newspaper or magazine in the country online, but you could also read so much more nonpolitical coverage. The explosion in political media was more than matched by the explosion in media covering music, television, diets, health, video games, rock climbing, spirituality, celebrity breakups, sports, gardening, cat pictures, genealogical records — really, everything.

The key factor now, Prior argued, was not access to political information but interest in political information. He made his point by comparing it to television. Like the internet, television multiplied the amount of information available to people, and it spread like wildfire. But unlike the internet, television, at least in its early years, offered little choice. You might own a television because you refused to miss I Love Lucy, but if you had the TV on in the evening, you ended up sitting through the news anyway. Similarly, you might subscribe to the newspaper for the sports page, but that meant seeing the political stories on A1. Politics was bundled alongside everything else, and even the uninterested were pushed to consume political news.

The digital revolution offered access to unimaginably vast vistas of information, but, just as important, it offered access to unimaginably more choice. And that explosion of choice widened that interested/uninterested divide. Greater choices let the devotees learn more and the uninterested know less.

To test this, Prior surveyed more than 2,300 people about their content preferences and their political knowledge. And because he was conducting this survey in 2002 and 2003, the early years of the internet and still reasonably early for cable, he was able to survey people who had internet access, those who had cable access, those who had both, and those who had neither.

Content preferences — which is to say, how much people wanted to consume political information versus how much they wanted to consume other forms of entertainment — had little effect on the knowledge of those without cable and internet access. Even if you wanted more political information, you didn’t have easy access to it, so the interest didn’t translate cleanly into information.

What the digital information revolution offered wasn’t just more information but more choice of information

But among those with cable and internet access, the difference in political knowledge between those with the highest and lowest interest in cable news was 27 percent. That dwarfed the difference in political knowledge between people with the highest and lowest levels of schooling. “In a high-choice environment, people’s content preferences become better predictors of political learning than even their level of education,” Prior wrote.

Prior was conducting this research in the early 2000s, before Facebook and Twitter, before mobile internet and YouTube algorithms, before MSNBC’s leftward turn, before BuzzFeed and HuffPost, before Breitbart and the alt-right, before Vox. The internet has become much better at learning what we want and giving us more of it since then. The competition for audience, and the threat to journalistic business models, has become much more intense since then. And all of this has changed both how political news is produced and how it’s consumed.

Political media is for the politically invested

In an age of choice, political journalism is a business that serves people interested in political news and that tries to create more people interested in political news. And to be interested in politics is, for most people, to choose a side. How could it be otherwise? The differences between the parties and their coalitions are profound. They are ideological, geographic, demographic, temperamental. Whether your side wins or loses is a literal matter of life and death — perhaps not for you, but, given the stakes for health insurance and foreign policy, certainly for someone.

In today’s media sphere, where the explosion of choices has made it possible to get the political media you really want, it’s expressed itself in polarized media that attaches to political identity, conflict, and celebrity. That is to say, it expresses itself in journalism and commentary that is more directly about the question of why your side should win and the other side should lose.

I’ve produced a lot of this kind of journalism. I cover politics because I think policy is important, which is to say, because I think who wins and who loses policy fights is important. And, obviously, my views on those questions are rational, judicious, disinterested, and objectively correct. The problem is lots of other people are doing that kind of work, too, and some of them come to different conclusions than I do.

But rather than argue over who’s right, I want to step back and look at how a political media system increasingly organized around that axis deepens political identity, hardens polarization, and raises the political stakes.

The simplest measure for assessing political journalism is whether it’s giving those who follow it a more accurate understanding of American politics. As one disturbing window into this question, consider a fascinating study published by Douglas Ahler and Gaurav Sood in 2018.

In it, Ahler and Sood conducted a survey asking people “to estimate the percentage of Democrats who are black, atheist or agnostic, union members, and gay, lesbian, or bisexual, and the percentage of Republicans who are evangelical, 65 or older, Southern, and earn over $250,000 per year.” They were asking, in other words, how much people thought the composition of the parties fit the caricatures of the parties.

Misperceptions were particularly high when people were asked to describe the other party. Democrats believed 44 percent of Republicans earned more than $250,000 a year; it’s actually 2 percent. Republicans believed that 38 percent of Democrats were gay, lesbian, or bisexual; the correct answer is about 6 percent. Democrats believed that more than four in 10 Republicans are seniors; in truth, seniors make up about 20 percent of the GOP. Republicans believed that 46 percent of Democrats are black and 44 percent belong to a union; in reality, about 24 percent of Democrats are black and less than 11 percent belong to a union.

Here’s the kicker: As the charts below show, the more political media people consumed, the more mistaken they were, in general, about the other party. This is a damning result: The more political media you absorb, the more warped your perspective of the other side becomes.

The old line on local reporting was “If it bleeds, it leads.” For political reporting, the principle is “If it outrages, it leads.” And outrage is deeply connected to identity — we are outraged when members of other groups threaten our group and violate our values. As such, polarized media doesn’t emphasize commonalities, it weaponizes differences; it doesn’t focus on the best of the other side, it threatens you with the worst.

As that last paragraph suggests, I’m about to step into some dangerous territory, so let me say this clearly: I’m not asserting moral equivalence, and in the book this article is adapted from, I have much more to say about the ways and reasons the left and the right — including their media spheres — have diverged.

But virtually everyone in political media is competing for audience attention and loyalty amid a cacophony of choices. We all make different decisions about how to compete for that audience, but since we are all trying to attract other human beings, there are certain similarities in our approach.

Why audience-driven media is identitarian media

Historically, not only did the audience have less choice in what media to consume, the media didn’t have much information about the audience. The networks had ratings. The newspapers had subscription renewals. Everyone received letters. But that was it.

I used to regularly guest-host on cable news. The emotional rhythm of that workday crested at 4 pm, when the Nielsen numbers came out and everyone stopped to compare how their show did against the competition. If you beat your competitors, you could rest easy. If you didn’t, you had to worry. And if you lost a few times in a row, you’d start getting calls from upstairs. Maybe your programming should stick closer to the news of the day. Maybe you needed shorter intros, or longer intros, or more guests, or more heat.

Cable news is journalism, but it’s also a business. Chris Hayes, who anchors MSNBC’s 8 pm newscast and is among the most thoughtful, civic-minded journalists in the industry, referenced a Will Ferrell joke from Anchorman 2 on his podcast, saying, “What if instead of telling people the things they need to know, we tell them what they want to know?” That is, he says, “the creation story of cable news.”

“At some level,” he continued, “we’re wedding DJs. And the wedding DJ’s job is to get you on the floor.” The point is not that this leaves no room for serious journalism. As Hayes says, there are good wedding DJs and bad wedding DJs, and the work of being a cable news host is making sure you’re one of the good ones. But this is the business context in which cable news decisions are made.

Then came the rise of real-time digital analytics. Every digital newsroom in the country, including Vox, subscribes to some service or another that tracks traffic in a gamified, constantly updating interface. The most influential is Chartbeat, which shows you every article on your site, indicates the number of people on each article at any given second, and colors the dots representing those people to tell you how they found the article. Green dots mean they found you through a search engine. Purple dots mean they came from a social network, usually Facebook, Twitter, or Reddit. It’s pure pleasure to watch the display for an article you worked hard on fill with dots.

But we don’t just want people to read our work. We want people to spread our work — to be so moved by what we wrote or said that they log on to Facebook and share it with their friends or head over to Reddit and try to tell the world. That’s how you get those dots to multiply. But people don’t share quiet voices. They share loud voices. They share work that moves them, that helps them express to their friends who they are and how they feel. Social platforms are about curating and expressing a public-facing identity. They’re about saying, “I’m a person who cares about this, likes that, and loathes this other thing.” They are about signaling the groups you belong to and, just as important, the groups you don’t belong to.

BuzzFeed’s secret: Identity = virality

The rise of BuzzFeed made this subtext into text. Its co-founder and CEO, Jonah Peretti, originally built BuzzFeed on the side as a skunkworks for experimenting with how viral content spread online. The answer soon became clear: Identity is the slingshot.

“A classic early BuzzFeed post, and later video, was ‘13 Struggles All Left-Handers Know to Be True,’” Peretti tells me. “Another early classic was ‘Signs You Were Raised by Immigrant Parents.’ That one’s a racial identity but also an immigrant identity.”

There are so many more. One of BuzzFeed’s most popular series was “X Things Only a Y Would Understand.” A Google search for those keywords brings up articles like “14 Things Only Anxious People Will Understand,” “19 Things Only People With Fibromyalgia Will Understand,” “53 Things Only ’80s Girls Can Understand,” “30 Things Everyone Who Went to College Will Understand,” “27 Struggles You’ll Only Understand If You Were Born Before 1995,” “38 Things Only Someone Who Was a Scout Would Know,” “19 Comics Only Night Owls Will Understand,” “19 Things You’ll Only Understand if You Had Strict Parents,” “18 Photos That Only People Who Had Braces Will Understand.”

This is identity media in its purest form. Sharing the scouting article says you were a Scout, and you were a serious enough Scout to understand the signifiers and experiences that only Scouts had. To post that article on Facebook is to make a statement about who you are, who your group is, and, just as important, who is excluded.

In political media, identity is affirmed and activated with slightly more oblique headlines. But the underlying dynamic is the same: This public figure that you and everyone in your group loathe said something awful. This poll came out saying you and your group are going to win or, better yet, that your out-group is going to lose. This slashing column explains why you’re right about everything and why your opponents are wrong.

A lot of these pieces are accurate, and some of them are genuinely useful. I have written many of them myself, and edited countless more. But cumulatively, it’s a sharp change from the days in which most political content people saw was self-consciously trying to avoid offending anyone. The stories that thrive when your business model is a local monopoly that needs a news product that’s appealing to every kind of person who might shop at a department store are different from the stories that thrive when your business model is people who strongly agree with your stories sharing them with their friends.

Identities are malleable things. They can be activated or kept dormant, strengthened or weakened, created or left in the void. The flood of identity-oriented content deepens the identities it repeatedly triggers, confirms, or threatens.

Many of us who wrote about politics on the internet before the rise of social media lament the feeling that something has been lost, that a space that once felt fresh and generative now feels toxic and narrow. In her book Trick Mirror, Jia Tolentino offers a description of what changed that feels right to me, which is that social media shifted the “organizing principle” of online discourse:

The early internet had been constructed around lines of affinity and openness. But when the internet moved to an organizing principle of opposition, much of what had formerly been surprising and rewarding and curious became tedious, noxious, and grim. This shift partly reflects basic social physics. Having a mutual enemy is a quick way to make a friend—we learn this as early as elementary school—and politically, it’s much easier to organize people against something than it is to unite them in an affirmative vision. And, within the economy of attention, conflict always gets more people to look.

When I entered journalism, the term of art for pieces infused with perspective was “opinion journalism.” The point of the work was to convey an opinion. Nowadays, I think a lot of it is closer to “identity journalism” — the effect of the work, given the social channels through which it’s consumed, is to reinforce an identity.

But an identity, once adopted, is harder to change than an opinion. An identity that binds you into a community you care about is costly and painful to abandon, and the mind will go to great lengths to avoid abandoning it. So the more media people see that encourages them to think of themselves as part of a group, and the more they publicly proclaim — through sharing and liking and following and subscribing — that they are part of a group, the deeper that identity roots and the more resistant the underlying views become to change.

Reading the other side doesn’t change our minds

Many people worry that modern media generates polarization by locking us into echo chambers. We’ve cocooned ourselves into hearing information that only tells us how right we are, and that’s making us more extreme.

There is an optimistic theory embedded in this story: If only we crossed the informational aisle, our enmity and polarization would ebb.

Beginning in October 2017, a group of political scientists and sociologists decided to test this theory. In the largest study of its kind conducted, they paid 1,220 regular Twitter users who identified as either Democrats or Republicans to follow a bot retweeting elected officials, media figures, and opinion leaders from the other side. The participants took regular surveys asking about their views on 10 issues ranging from immigration to government waste to corporate profits to LGBTQ acceptance.

The result of the month-long exposure to popular, authoritative voices from the other side of the aisle was that respondents became more, not less, polarized. “We find that Republicans who followed a liberal Twitter bot became substantially more conservative posttreatment,” write the authors. “Democrats exhibited slight increases in liberal attitudes after following a conservative Twitter bot, although these effects are not statistically significant.”

The difference between the Democratic and Republican responses is interesting and merits more study. But the key finding is that neither group responded to exposure to the other side by moderating its own views. In both cases, hearing contrary opinions drove partisans not just to a deeper certainty in the rightness of their cause, but to more polarized policy positions — Republicans became more conservative rather than more liberal, and Democrats, if anything happened at all, became more liberal rather than more conservative.

I spoke to Christopher Bail, one of the study’s authors and the head of Duke University’s Polarization Lab. “For a long time, people have been assuming that exposing people to opposing views creates the opportunity for moderation,” he told me. “If I could humbly claim to figure out one thing, it’s that that’s not a simple process. If Twitter tweaks its algorithms to put one Republican for every nine Democrats in your Twitter feed, that won’t increase moderation.”

There is evidence that structuring positive, collaborative interactions can promote understanding. But very little in either political media or social media is designed for positive interactions with the other side. Most political media isn’t even designed for persuasion. For all the reasons we’ve discussed, the bulk of opinionated political media is written for the side that already agrees with the author, and most partisan elected officials are tweeting to their supporters, who follow them and fundraise for them, rather than to their critics, who don’t.

When we talk about political media, we tend to cut a sharp line between the political elites who create the media and the audience that consumes it. But that’s a mistake. No one consumes more political, and politicized, media than political elites. This is part of the reason political media has an enormous effect on politics, even though only a small fraction of the country regularly consumes it.

Politicians are increasingly addicted to Twitter, with the president being only the most prominent example. Fox News has whipped the Republican Party into a number of government shutdowns, and much of Trump’s most offensive rhetoric comes on a direct conveyor belt from conservative media feeding him conspiracies that he transforms into presidential proclamations.

Indeed, the impeachment effort House Democrats launched against Trump stems from Trump believing a set of anti-Biden conspiracies pushed by Breitbart editor-at-large Peter Schweizer and heavily promoted on Fox News. Most Americans had never heard of Hunter Biden, much less followed vague insinuations about Ukrainian prosecutors. But the president was sufficiently persuaded that he threw the weight of his administration into an investigation, setting off a chain of events that changed American political history and further polarized the country.

Politics is, first and foremost, driven by the people who pay the most attention and wield the most power — and those people opt in to extraordinarily politicized media. They then create the political system they perceive.

Journalists are hardly immune to these forces. We become more polarized, and more polarizing, when we start spending our time in polarizing environments. I have seen it in myself, and I have watched it in others: When we’re going for retweets, or when our main form of audience feedback is coming from highly partisan social media users, it subtly but importantly warps our news judgment. It changes who we cover and what stories we chase. And when we cover politics in a more polarized way, anticipating or absorbing the tastes of a more polarized audience, we create a more polarized political reality.

The media creates, it doesn’t just reflect

The news is supposed to be a mirror held up to the world, but the world is far too vast to fit in our mirror. The fundamental thing the media does all day, every day, is decide what to cover — decide, that is, what is newsworthy.

Here’s the dilemma: to decide what to cover is to become the shaper of the news rather than a mirror held up to the news. It makes journalists actors rather than observers. It annihilates our fundamental conception of ourselves. And yet it’s the most important decision we make. If we decide to give more coverage to Hillary Clinton’s emails than to her policy proposals — which is what we did — then we make her emails more important to the public’s understanding of her character and potential presidency than her policy proposals. In doing so, we shape not just the news but the election, and thus the country.

While I’m critical of the specific decision my industry made in that case, this problem is inescapable. The news media isn’t just an actor in politics. It’s arguably the most powerful actor in politics. It’s the primary intermediary between what politicians do and what the public knows. The way we try to get around this is by conceptually outsourcing the decisions about what we cover to the idea of newsworthiness. If we simply cover what’s newsworthy, then we’re not the ones making those decisions — it’s the neutral, external judgment of news worthiness that bears responsibility. The problem is that no one, anywhere, has a rigorous definition of newsworthiness, much less a definition that they actually follow.

A simple example comes in the treatment of presidential and pre-presidential rhetoric. On some level, anything that the president says, or that a plausible candidate for president says, is newsworthy. Yet only a small minority of what is said by presidential candidates, or even presidents, gets covered as major news.

When President Obama gave a speech on manufacturing policy at an Ohio steel mill and when Sen. Marco Rubio held a town hall discussing higher education costs in New Hampshire, they struggled to get the press to take notice. Trump, meanwhile, routinely gets cable networks to air his rallies live by lying flagrantly, lobbing racist and sexist insults, and generally behaving outrageously. Whether this is strategy or intuition, the result is the same: Trump hacked the media’s true definition of newsworthiness, and it lets him control the agenda. This was true well before he won the presidency — indeed, it might be why he won the presidency.

In their book Identity Crisis, political scientists John Sides, Lynn Vavreck, and Michael Tesler find that “from May 1, 2015, to April 30, 2016, Trump’s median share of cable news mentions was 52 percent.” There were 17 Republican candidates running for president, so Trump was getting more than half of all the media coverage, with the other 16 candidates splitting the remainder.

It gets worse. “Trump received 78 percent of all coverage on CNN between Aug. 24 and Sept. 4, 2015,” and by November 2015, “Trump had received more evening network news coverage—234 minutes—than the entire Democratic field. By contrast, Ted Cruz had received seven minutes.” This was a choice the media made, and not for the best reasons. In February 2016, for instance, the chair of CBS said of Donald Trump’s candidacy, and the ratings it drew, “it may not be good for America, but it’s damn good for CBS. ... It’s a terrible thing to say, but bring it on, Donald. Keep going.”

Sides, Vavreck, and Tesler argue that in a chaotic, crowded primary, the media coverage Trump received was crucial to legitimizing his campaign: “Republican voters had received no clear signal about who the front-runner was or should be. The resulting uncertainty meant that this signal needed to come from somewhere else. It was news media coverage that would fill this void.” The coverage of Trump also made it impossible for his challengers to get their messages heard.

As president, his rambling monologues, which are unusually detached from both factual rigor and his administration’s policymaking decisions, are treated as worthier of airtime than the more careful, factual, and policy-predictive speeches of his predecessors.

“Journalism academics have always known that newsworthiness, as the American press defines it, isn’t a system with any coherence to it,” Jay Rosen, a journalism professor at New York University, told me. “It doesn’t make any sense. It’s just a list of factors that occasionally come together to produce news. There’s no real logic to it, other than it’s a list of things that can make something news. The advantage of it is that it leaves maximum leeway for editors to say, ‘This is news,’ and, ‘That’s not news,’ and so it’s news if a journalist decides it’s news.”

In practice, judgments of newsworthiness are often contagious; nothing obscures the fact that a decision is being made quite like everyone else making it, too. In the modern era, a shortcut to newsworthiness is social media virality; if people are already talking about a story or a tweet, that makes it newsworthy almost by definition.

This can lead the country into odd, angry cul-de-sacs. I remember returning from an offline vacation only to find the entire political media at war over a viral video in which students from Covington Catholic High School wearing MAGA hats appeared to harass Nathan Phillips, a Native American elder playing a drum. In the original video, which took place during a protest at the National Mall in Washington, DC, the teens were seemingly mocking, smirking, and making tomahawk chop motions at Phillips. A longer video muddied the waters, offering evidence that the teens were harassed by members of the fringe Black Israelites group beforehand. Soon enough, the media was filled with takes and counter-takes, and President Trump was weighing in. “Nick Sandmann and the students of Covington have become symbols of Fake News and how evil it can be,” he tweeted.

Nick Sandmann and the students of Covington have become symbols of Fake News and how evil it can be. They have captivated the attention of the world, and I know they will use it for the good - maybe even to bring people together. It started off unpleasant, but can end in a dream! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 22, 2019

What was striking, walking into this debate without the (dis)advantage of being present for its initial escalation, was how angry everyone was over something that objectively didn’t matter. How was this newsworthy?

The answer was that it had been dominating social media all weekend, and that had made it newsworthy. And why had it dominated social media? Because it was a perfect collision of political identities: MAGA-hatted teenagers against a peaceful, drumming Native American elder. Liberal news outlets turning the country against conservative, Christian children from a religious school. It was an object lesson in how social media’s preference for identitarian conflict focuses the media on identitarian conflicts, even when those collisions are almost comically obscure.

These are dynamics that Trump exploits daily. He weaponizes outrageousness, offensiveness, and identity cues to capture a share of political coverage unknown in the modern era. He’s shown that in a competitive media environment — particularly one responsive to social platforms — you can dominate the media by lobbing grenades into our deepest social divides.

The media is how most Americans get their information about politics and politicians, and if the media is tilting, or being tilted, toward certain kinds of political stories and figures, then the political system will tilt in that direction, too.

Trump is a product of the tilting, but he is not the first, and he will not be the last. The political media is biased, but not toward the left or right so much as toward loud, outrageous, colorful, inspirational, confrontational. It is biased toward the political stories and figures who activate our identities, because it is biased toward and dependent on the fraction of the country with the most intense political identities.

The upshot was not , of course , that the illegal killing was kind of a big deal or that the person who authorized it — Donald Trump — had potentially set the stage for calamity and bloodshed of untold proportions . Rather , the crucial point to focus on was the “ polarized reaction by American news outlets . ”
Trotted out to confirm the severity of the situation was one William A. Jacobson of Cornell Law School , who bemoaned the sad state of the “ liberal media ” : “ Take any topic and they portray Trump as irresponsible and ignorant . This time those portrayals are on steroids , with Trump being portrayed as a warmonger surrounded by sycophants isolated from reality . ”
In reality , the oft-invoked allegation of “ polarization ” in the media and the broader political establishment hardly holds water ; it ’ s like arguing that 21 degrees Fahrenheit and 22 degrees Fahrenheit are polar opposites . Just recall , for example , that time Trump fired cruise missiles at Syria and the liberal media thought it was pretty much the most exciting thing to have ever happened .
A glance at media coverage of the Soleimani assassination also fails to produce much evidence of a fanatical anti-Trump campaign . The lead paragraph of a New York Times article about the “ Master of Iran ’ s Intrigue ” is devoted to establishing how Soleimani was “ behind hundreds of American deaths in Iraq and waves of militia attacks against Israel. ” The second paragraph reiterates that he was a “ powerful and shadowy . . . spymaster at the head of Iran ’ s security machinery . ”
In other words : he deserved it . And never mind that the United States has been behind countless thousands of Iraqi deaths in Iraq or that — as the article later reveals — the “ waves of militia attacks ” took place during the brutal twenty-two-year military occupation of south Lebanon by Israel , which also boasts the distinction of having slaughtered tens of thousands of people in that country .
When you ’ re not actually in the business of speaking truth to power , some things are better left unsaid .
The New York Times article also mentions that Soleimani and other Iranian officials were “ designated as terrorists by the United States and Israel in 2011 , accused of a plot to kill the ambassador of Saudi Arabia . . . in Washington. ” Although that whole alleged plot has been soundly debunked , it bears raising the question : if the United States assassinated an Iranian official on foreign soil , doesn ’ t that qualify as terrorism ?
The Washington Post opinion section , meanwhile , offered the analysis that , in killing Soleimani , Trump competently “ enforce [ d ] the red line he drew on Iran ” — i.e. , everything is Iran ’ s fault , and if the country “ miscalculates again , then the regime has been warned : Next time , the target will likely be Iran . ”
This is not to say there has been no media criticism — there has been — but the problem is that the concern over the fallout of Trump ’ s bellicose act has to do primarily with the possibility of Iranian retaliation against the US military , US “ assets , ” and US “ interests. ” Yet these three components of US empire are precisely what have helped made life hell for Iranians , from the 1953 CIA-orchestrated coup against Mohammad Mossadegh — which enabled a lengthy reign of terror by the torture-happy shah , an overzealous purchaser of US weaponry — to the current crippling sanctions regime , a form of warfare in its own right .
Furthermore , seeing as the media has devoted much time lately to cheerleading for war with Iran — perpetuating the nuclear weapons myth and engaging in a general vilification of all things Iranian , much like in the run-up to the Iraq War — it ’ s not clear why anyone should be particularly shocked by the assassination .
And while Fox News may prefer to despair over toxic media polarization and the allegedly vast ideological chasm between Republicans and Democrats , let ’ s not forget that years before John Bolton advocated — on the pages of the New York Times — to “ bomb Iran , ” Hillary Clinton threatened to “ totally obliterate ” the country .
The Democratic reaction to Trump ’ s latest stunt has been disingenuous at best . As Sarah Lazare and Michael Arria point out over at In These Times , Democratic ruckus over the manner in which the president has chosen to go to battle with Iran — without congressional approval — “ belie [ s ] Democrats ’ role in helping lay the groundwork for the growing confrontation ” in the first place . The $ 738 billion defense bill for 2020 , for instance , was passed with Democratic support after being purged of two amendments : one “ to block funding for a war with Iran barring congressional approval , ” and one to repeal the existing “ Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists , ” which Trump administration officials have “ suggested . . . may give them authority to go to war with Iran . ”
Democrats like Joe Biden have made sure to qualify their objections to Trump ’ s supposed recklessness with an affirmation of Soleimani ’ s diabolical , terroristic nature and the justice that was supposedly achieved by eradicating him from the face of the earth .
As Trump and his accomplices — including his de facto allies in the Democratic Party — pursue isolation from reality to the lethal detriment of the rest of the world , who knows when they ’ ll finally cross a red line of their own .","In the aftermath of the United States’ latest war crime — the assassination-by-drone strike in Baghdad of Qassem Soleimani, head of the Quds Force of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps — Fox News decided to educate its audience on the proper takeaway from the episode.

Well, yeah.

In reality, the oft-invoked allegation of “polarization” in the media and the broader political establishment hardly holds water; it’s like arguing that 21 degrees Fahrenheit and 22 degrees Fahrenheit are polar opposites. Just recall, for example, that time Trump fired cruise missiles at Syria and the liberal media thought it was pretty much the most exciting thing to have ever happened.

A glance at media coverage of the Soleimani assassination also fails to produce much evidence of a fanatical anti-Trump campaign. The lead paragraph of a New York Times article about the “Master of Iran’s Intrigue” is devoted to establishing how Soleimani was “behind hundreds of American deaths in Iraq and waves of militia attacks against Israel.” The second paragraph reiterates that he was a “powerful and shadowy . . . spymaster at the head of Iran’s security machinery.”

In other words: he deserved it. And never mind that the United States has been behind countless thousands of Iraqi deaths in Iraq or that — as the article later reveals — the “waves of militia attacks” took place during the brutal twenty-two-year military occupation of south Lebanon by Israel, which also boasts the distinction of having slaughtered tens of thousands of people in that country.

When you’re not actually in the business of speaking truth to power, some things are better left unsaid.

The New York Times article also mentions that Soleimani and other Iranian officials were “designated as terrorists by the United States and Israel in 2011, accused of a plot to kill the ambassador of Saudi Arabia . . . in Washington.” Although that whole alleged plot has been soundly debunked, it bears raising the question: if the United States assassinated an Iranian official on foreign soil, doesn’t that qualify as terrorism?

The Washington Post opinion section, meanwhile, offered the analysis that, in killing Soleimani, Trump competently “enforce[d] the red line he drew on Iran” — i.e., everything is Iran’s fault, and if the country “miscalculates again, then the regime has been warned: Next time, the target will likely be Iran.”

This is not to say there has been no media criticism — there has been — but the problem is that the concern over the fallout of Trump’s bellicose act has to do primarily with the possibility of Iranian retaliation against the US military, US “assets,” and US “interests.” Yet these three components of US empire are precisely what have helped made life hell for Iranians, from the 1953 CIA-orchestrated coup against Mohammad Mossadegh — which enabled a lengthy reign of terror by the torture-happy shah, an overzealous purchaser of US weaponry — to the current crippling sanctions regime, a form of warfare in its own right.

Furthermore, seeing as the media has devoted much time lately to cheerleading for war with Iran — perpetuating the nuclear weapons myth and engaging in a general vilification of all things Iranian, much like in the run-up to the Iraq War — it’s not clear why anyone should be particularly shocked by the assassination.

And while Fox News may prefer to despair over toxic media polarization and the allegedly vast ideological chasm between Republicans and Democrats, let’s not forget that years before John Bolton advocated — on the pages of the New York Times — to “bomb Iran,” Hillary Clinton threatened to “totally obliterate” the country.

The Democratic reaction to Trump’s latest stunt has been disingenuous at best. As Sarah Lazare and Michael Arria point out over at In These Times , Democratic ruckus over the manner in which the president has chosen to go to battle with Iran — without congressional approval — “belie[s] Democrats’ role in helping lay the groundwork for the growing confrontation” in the first place. The $738 billion defense bill for 2020, for instance, was passed with Democratic support after being purged of two amendments: one “to block funding for a war with Iran barring congressional approval,” and one to repeal the existing “Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists,” which Trump administration officials have “suggested . . . may give them authority to go to war with Iran.”

Democrats like Joe Biden have made sure to qualify their objections to Trump’s supposed recklessness with an affirmation of Soleimani’s diabolical, terroristic nature and the justice that was supposedly achieved by eradicating him from the face of the earth.

As Trump and his accomplices — including his de facto allies in the Democratic Party — pursue isolation from reality to the lethal detriment of the rest of the world, who knows when they’ll finally cross a red line of their own.",www.jacobinmag.com,left,Zbo6Qfc2Ymo2xU3W

Google News and Google News search engine results appear to show a “strong preference” for media organizations that are on the left of the political spectrum, a new report finds.

The report from the media technology group AllSides, out Tuesday, analyzed Google News’ homepage and search engine results from the news page over a two-week period and determined that news outlets with a ""left"" bias were more often prominently displayed.

But the study found no evidence Google had intentionally altered search results for the purpose of “suppressing voices of conservatives,” as President Donald Trump has previously stated.

Trump has previously claimed that Google and other search engines are “rigged” against him.

""Google search results for 'Trump News' shows only the viewing/reporting of Fake News Media,"" Trump tweeted Aug. 28. The administration has said the president was considering regulations against the tech giant.

The prescreened questions from the audience also included six from a neutral position ( 8 from Tapper ) , but 12 from the left ( 1 from Tapper ) .
The first question was from Jackson State University doctoral candidate Christopher Lane who asked Warren about how she was going to convince white Republicans to vote for her when they were to dumb to vote in their own interest :
Mississippi is a deeply red state and one of the poorest states in the country . Yet many white poor and working-class citizens continue to vote against their economic interests . What message , if any , do you have that may resonate with them that may encourage them to vote for you ?
The next two questions were from women who wanted to know about how Warren planned to unify the country after President Trump brought about an increase in hate crimes , and what her plan was for some form of reparations .
The first question from the right came from high school history teacher Paul Buckley :
Conservatives are using the socialist label as a means of attack . So how and to what degree will your policies encourage the traditional value of self-reliance offering financially challenged a hand up but not a handout .

( … ) MARY CRUMP : Thank you , Senator Warren , for being here . How do you plan to make sure the extremely rich pay their fair taxes ?
Of course , there was the obligatory , “ What is your position on the impeachment of Donald Trump ? ”
Warren also got a question from the audience about encouraging alternative energy . It was one of the few questions Tapper asked a follow up for and it was to tee her up to promote increasing the gas tax . “ And as you know , the federal gas tax has not been raised since 1993 , leaving many states to fend for themselves to maintain the roads and bridges . Would you support theoretically raising the gas tax to pay for the infrastructure needs ? ” Warren was not for it because it disproportionally landed on poorer folks .
A question Tapper refused to ask a follow up for was this scorcher from lawyer and U.S. Army Reserve Officer Brennan Breeland :
Good evening , Senator . How do you respond to people who think that , regardless of the underlying facts , the way you handled the question of your Native American heritage was tone deaf , offensive , and indicative of a lack of presidential tact ?
Tapper really should have pressed Warren because in her answer she suggested she never received any career benefit from her claims of Native American heritage , when we know that to false .

Instead, it was an internal Department of Justice investigation lead by inspector general Michael Horowitz that led to McCabe's dismissal.

What does the narrative say?

In the immediate aftermath of Attorney General Jeff Session's decision to dismiss McCabe, the media have propagated the narrative that McCabe's termination was a political decision made to appease President Donald Trump.

On Saturday, the media were full of stories that pushed the angle that McCabe's firing was political and Trump is to blame. Indeed, those whose comments were most widely shared and reported by the media blamed Trump and framed the story as another move by the White House to obstruct special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.

MSNBC host Joe Scarborough tweeted: ""Everything goes back to Trump obstructing justice and undermining the investigation into his shameful behavior. Now he’s pressured the Attorney General of the United States to fire a 24 year FBI veteran...""

The comments of former CIA Director John Brennan were some of the most shared. He claimed Trump used McCabe as a ""scapegoat.""

Eric Holder, attorney general under former President Barack Obama, levied similar claimed to those made by Brennan and Scarborough.

CNN's Chris Cillizaa added to the hysteria:

Despite all of the claims and hysteria centering on Trump and his disdain for Mueller's investigation, the truth of why McCabe was fired just days before his planned retirement has nothing at all to do with the president.

What's the truth?

Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired McCabe upon a recommendation from the FBI’s Office of Professional Responsibility to terminate McCabe's employment.

According to the Wall Street Journal, the OPR made the recommendation based on findings from IG Horowitz's investigation, who discovered McCabe ""authorized the disclosure of sensitive information to a Wall Street Journal reporter about the investigation into the Clinton Foundation.""

Flynn, Jeffrey Lord, Mary Wishing, R. Emmett Tyrrell, John Glynn","Hillary famously shouted during the throes of the campaign , “ Why am I not up by 50 points ? ” No doubt the media feels similar rage as it pores over Trump ’ s latest job approval numbers , which have actually gone up since February , according to CNN : “ 42 % approve of Trump , highest in 11 months. ” The CNN correspondent , grudgingly reporting these numbers , chalked Trump ’ s staying power up to the “ economy . ”
But in a reversal of the Clintonian adage , it is not the economy , stupid , around CNN these days . It is the sex scandal . Womanizing pundits and louche-living hosts profess shock at Trump ’ s behavior . They act like it is all so incomprehensible to them . Jeffrey Toobin likes to crank up his wind machine about Trump ’ s lack of integrity , but not so long ago Toobin ’ s squalid personal life was tabloid fodder . He was cheating on his wife with former CNN correspondent Jeff Greenfield ’ s daughter , impregnated her , then ( unsuccessfully ) put pressure on her to get an abortion , according to the New York Daily News in 2010 .
“ Jeff and Casey [ Greenfield ] saw each other off and on over the years , ” says one source . “ She was married to someone else for two years . After her divorce , she started seeing Jeff again . He said he was going to leave his wife for her . But , by then , Casey had begun to distrust him . She suspected he had several other mistresses. ” In 2008 , when Greenfield became pregnant , and when she told Toobin the news , he offered her “ money if she ’ d have an abortion , ” says a source . He also allegedly offered to pay for her to have another child later via a sperm donor . “ When Casey wouldn ’ t have an abortion , Jeff told her she was going to regret it , that she shouldn ’ t expect any help from him , ” claims another source . Greenfield underwent a risky DNA test while pregnant , but Toobin didn ’ t provide his sample and stopped talking to her , according to sources . On the day she gave birth , Greenfield e-mailed Toobin , inviting him to meet his son , Rory . A source says Toobin didn ’ t reply .
The restoration of Lizza to his punditry duties marks quite a turnabout from December , when his employer issued this statement : “ The New Yorker recently learned that Ryan Lizza engaged in what we believe was improper sexual conduct . We have reviewed the matter and , as a result , have severed ties with Lizza . Due to a request for privacy , we are not commenting further. ” Lizza ’ s name popped up in the controversial and once-privately circulated “ Sh—y Media Men ” list with the cryptic allegation of being “ creepy af in the dms , ” apparently a reference to unwanted direct messages on Twitter .
But why should any of this stop CNN from providing near-hourly coverage of whatever Trump was up to eleven years ago ? It is still not clear what exactly that entails . Maybe Toobin could enlighten us on whether or not a single consensual act qualifies as an “ affair ” to be enumerated among feminism ’ s index of patriarchal offenses . It was humorous to see the greasy lawyer of Stormy Daniels insisting on the relevance of her story while simultaneously describing his opposition research for Rahm Emanuel as old news . Why , he hadn ’ t talked to Emanuel “ since 2007 , ” he said . In other words , the year after Stormy Daniels said she trysted with Trump . Naturally , he wasn ’ t pressed on the matter .
But what about the non-disclosure payment ? Surely , we can get Trump on that , salivated the media — the same media that has been doling those payments out for years . How many non-disclosure agreements has Jeff Zucker overseen ? And isn ’ t this the same media that yawned at the news of Bill Clinton giving Gennifer Flowers state jobs down in Arkansas ? The same media that pooh-poohed the significance of Clinton ’ s boon companion Vernon Jordan generating job interviews for Monica Lewinsky ?
The media ’ s coverage of Trump is like a nuisance suit that never ends . But instead of finishing Trump off , it wins him enduring sympathy . People turn on CNN and see correspondents who have divorced each other ( John King and Dana Bash ) reporting with such gravity about Trump ’ s broken vows and what all of that means for poor Melania , right before , of course , they humiliate her anew by whipping up yet another report on Stormy Daniels .
How can anybody take these frauds seriously ? Watching a decadent ruling class ’ s shunning of Trump , the American public finds itself in the position of Nick Carraway in The Great Gatsby . They can see at once Trump ’ s flaws and his supposed betters ’ even greater ones .","Hillary famously shouted during the throes of the campaign, “Why am I not up by 50 points?” No doubt the media feels similar rage as it pores over Trump’s latest job approval numbers, which have actually gone up since February, according to CNN: “42% approve of Trump, highest in 11 months.” The CNN correspondent, grudgingly reporting these numbers, chalked Trump’s staying power up to the “economy.”

But in a reversal of the Clintonian adage, it is not the economy, stupid, around CNN these days. It is the sex scandal. Womanizing pundits and louche-living hosts profess shock at Trump’s behavior. They act like it is all so incomprehensible to them. Jeffrey Toobin likes to crank up his wind machine about Trump’s lack of integrity, but not so long ago Toobin’s squalid personal life was tabloid fodder. He was cheating on his wife with former CNN correspondent Jeff Greenfield’s daughter, impregnated her, then (unsuccessfully) put pressure on her to get an abortion, according to the New York Daily News in 2010.

“Jeff and Casey [Greenfield] saw each other off and on over the years,” says one source. “She was married to someone else for two years. After her divorce, she started seeing Jeff again. He said he was going to leave his wife for her. But, by then, Casey had begun to distrust him. She suspected he had several other mistresses.” In 2008, when Greenfield became pregnant, and when she told Toobin the news, he offered her “money if she’d have an abortion,” says a source. He also allegedly offered to pay for her to have another child later via a sperm donor. “When Casey wouldn’t have an abortion, Jeff told her she was going to regret it, that she shouldn’t expect any help from him,” claims another source. Greenfield underwent a risky DNA test while pregnant, but Toobin didn’t provide his sample and stopped talking to her, according to sources. On the day she gave birth, Greenfield e-mailed Toobin, inviting him to meet his son, Rory. A source says Toobin didn’t reply.

How come the angry gods of me-too feminism haven’t gotten around to smiting Toobin? Oh, that’s right. He works for CNN. He enjoys that special immunity accorded members of the self-appointed ruling class. The Toobins look out for each other. Just ask Ryan Lizza, who resurfaced at CNN after the New Yorker sacked him for alleged goatishness, prompting the Washington Post to note:

The restoration of Lizza to his punditry duties marks quite a turnabout from December, when his employer issued this statement: “The New Yorker recently learned that Ryan Lizza engaged in what we believe was improper sexual conduct. We have reviewed the matter and, as a result, have severed ties with Lizza. Due to a request for privacy, we are not commenting further.” Lizza’s name popped up in the controversial and once-privately circulated “Sh—y Media Men” list with the cryptic allegation of being “creepy af in the dms,” apparently a reference to unwanted direct messages on Twitter.

But why should any of this stop CNN from providing near-hourly coverage of whatever Trump was up to eleven years ago? It is still not clear what exactly that entails. Maybe Toobin could enlighten us on whether or not a single consensual act qualifies as an “affair” to be enumerated among feminism’s index of patriarchal offenses. It was humorous to see the greasy lawyer of Stormy Daniels insisting on the relevance of her story while simultaneously describing his opposition research for Rahm Emanuel as old news. Why, he hadn’t talked to Emanuel “since 2007,” he said. In other words, the year after Stormy Daniels said she trysted with Trump. Naturally, he wasn’t pressed on the matter.

But what about the non-disclosure payment? Surely, we can get Trump on that, salivated the media — the same media that has been doling those payments out for years. How many non-disclosure agreements has Jeff Zucker overseen? And isn’t this the same media that yawned at the news of Bill Clinton giving Gennifer Flowers state jobs down in Arkansas? The same media that pooh-poohed the significance of Clinton’s boon companion Vernon Jordan generating job interviews for Monica Lewinsky?

The media’s coverage of Trump is like a nuisance suit that never ends. But instead of finishing Trump off, it wins him enduring sympathy. People turn on CNN and see correspondents who have divorced each other (John King and Dana Bash) reporting with such gravity about Trump’s broken vows and what all of that means for poor Melania, right before, of course, they humiliate her anew by whipping up yet another report on Stormy Daniels.

“I've addressed this question, I've addressed my personal feelings. I'm here to speak on behalf of the president. He's made his comments clear,” Sanders told Acosta during the televised briefing.

The exchange highlighted the us-versus-them mentality that has festered in the administration and in parts of the media in the 18 months since Trump took office.

Trump has been a president like no other, bending the truth as he sees fit and talking to supporters and bypassing the media with his Twitter account.

Coverage of Trump has become a 24-hour affair with no precedent, as the White House constantly stirs up stories that can both feed outrage about Trump, and fuel anger among the president’s supporters over how he is treated by the press.

It was clear during ABC ’ s World News Tonight that they were going to twist the cheering crowd as proof that even Republicans supported government controlled healthcare . “ Now , to the race for 2020 tonight , and the fiery town hall . Bernie Sanders on Fox News . And the question about health care in America , it drew a huge response from the audience , ” hyped sensationalist anchor David Muir .
ABC congressional correspondent Mary Bruce was full of energy as she explained how Sanders was “ at a town hall on the President 's favorite network ” and “ asked voters to embrace one of his most progressive ideas : Medicare for all . ”
She played a soundbite of town hall co-moderator Bret Baier conducting an impromptu poll of the Pennsylvania audience to see support for Sanders ’ plan :
I want to ask the audience a question , if you could raise your hands here , show of hands of how many people get their insurance from work , private insurance , right now . How many get it from private insurance ? Okay . Now , of those , who many are willing to transition to what the Senator says , a government-run system . [ Audience members cheer ]
“ His Medicare for all plan , often criticized by Republicans , got an enthusiastic response last night from audience members of both parties , ” boasted CBS political correspondent Ed O ’ Keefe on Evening News .
Even though Bruce also noted that the audience was made up of “ Democrats and Republicans ” , neither correspondent shared a soundbite of Baier explaining how “ this audience has a lot of Democrats in it . It has Republicans , independents , democratic socialists , [ and ] conservatives. ” In fact , ABC cut off a soundbite just as Baier was making that point .
As CNN admittedly does with their Democratic town halls , the Fox News town hall crowd seemed more weighted for those voting in the Democratic primaries and caucuses . While ABC and CBS were trying to make hay out of the cheers and the raised hands , they failed to mention that there were plenty in the crowd that didn ’ t do either .
So , given the facts of the situation , it becomes clear these networks were looking to mislead their viewers about the situation and who was actually cheering . As further evidence of that intent , ABC 's on-screen headline read : `` Memorable Moment : Sanders draws unexpected support for health plan '' ( pictured above ) .

It was clear during ABC’s World News Tonight that they were going to twist the cheering crowd as proof that even Republicans supported government controlled healthcare. “Now, to the race for 2020 tonight, and the fiery town hall. Bernie Sanders on Fox News. And the question about health care in America, it drew a huge response from the audience,” hyped sensationalist anchor David Muir.

ABC congressional correspondent Mary Bruce was full of energy as she explained how Sanders was “at a town hall on the President's favorite network” and “asked voters to embrace one of his most progressive ideas: Medicare for all.”

She played a soundbite of town hall co-moderator Bret Baier conducting an impromptu poll of the Pennsylvania audience to see support for Sanders’ plan:

I want to ask the audience a question, if you could raise your hands here, show of hands of how many people get their insurance from work, private insurance, right now. How many get it from private insurance? Okay. Now, of those, who many are willing to transition to what the Senator says, a government-run system. [Audience members cheer]

“His Medicare for all plan, often criticized by Republicans, got an enthusiastic response last night from audience members of both parties,” boasted CBS political correspondent Ed O’Keefe on Evening News.

Even though Bruce also noted that the audience was made up of “Democrats and Republicans”, neither correspondent shared a soundbite of Baier explaining how “this audience has a lot of Democrats in it. It has Republicans, independents, democratic socialists, [and] conservatives.” In fact, ABC cut off a soundbite just as Baier was making that point.

As CNN admittedly does with their Democratic town halls, the Fox News town hall crowd seemed more weighted for those voting in the Democratic primaries and caucuses. While ABC and CBS were trying to make hay out of the cheers and the raised hands, they failed to mention that there were plenty in the crowd that didn’t do either.

So, given the facts of the situation, it becomes clear these networks were looking to mislead their viewers about the situation and who was actually cheering. As further evidence of that intent, ABC's on-screen headline read: ""Memorable Moment: Sanders draws unexpected support for health plan"" (pictured above).

He ’ s spent the preceding hour typing out edits to his script with slightly hunched posture , raising his eyebrows at his keyboard and reading his monologue to himself to test its accuracy and its cadence . The computers behind him—clad in giant white shells , they look like robots from the Star Wars universe—are each manned by researchers . Several of them are scanning their email and news sites , one is looking at @ realdonaldtrump on Twitter . And Smith , wired with an earpiece to the control room , is periodically issuing commands—to those researchers , to the producers who call his desk phone , to the air around him . “ We need to get a statement from Israeli police , ” he says , looking to bulk up a wire report about Benjamin Netanyahu . “ That ’ ll give the Jerusalem bureau something to do . ”
Shepard Smith at Fox News ' offices in New York , Thursday , March 1 , 2018 . Andres Kudacki for TIME
When the countdown to Smith ’ s hour of airtime arrives at 2:59 , it ’ s just a number . Smith silently sits at his anchor chair , watching White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders field questions from reporters in what ’ s become a near-daily occurrence : his show is getting pre-empted by the most popular political drama in America . He scrolls through his phone , then leans forward on his elbows ready for Sanders to wrap . When she does , he kicks off his show a few minutes late with discussion of the “ brand-new timeline ” Sanders offered for the scandal of the day . Much of his script now useless , Smith does the work of writing and editing as he speaks .
The president has scrambled the day-to-day lives of everyone in the news business , not least of which those at the network with which Donald Trump begins every morning . As Fox has tacked further to the right in its opinion programming , Smith ’ s role has at times seemed like a challenge . Being the old-fashioned anchorman and reporter at a network known for new-fashioned provocation and opinion may be the hardest job at Fox News , and one Smith mused about walking away from over the course of two interviews this winter . On March 15 , the network announced Smith would stay and that he had signed a multiyear contract renewal . Which means Smith is going to have many more chances to tell viewers what they don ’ t want to hear .
“ I can remember a time , ” the 54-year-old anchor says after taping has wrapped at 4 p.m. , “ when we would do a rundown in the morning and , probably , that ’ s what would happen. ” Those around him are feeling the Trump era as well . “ I ’ m tired , ” says Kim Rosenberg , the network ’ s vice-president of news and Smith ’ s producer and friend . “ The news cycle goes through many evolutions during the day . Trump will tweet or they ’ ll add a news conference or the White House briefing will be pushed back three times , and the news cycle changes . ”
Now , his show is often eaten into by the White House ’ s televised press briefings . “ Even now , it still boggles my mind that the next time Sarah Huckabee Sanders is on , over a year into a presidency , that it is something that all three networks will take live , ” says Jay Wallace , the network ’ s president of news since 2017 and Smith ’ s former executive producer . “ That ’ s unheard-of. ” Having hustled in his early career and established his bona fides as an anchor after that , Smith would seem to be at a point where he could enjoy the status , visibility , and routine schedule a marquee anchor enjoys . Instead , Sanders , and her boss , have created a climate of uncertainty that ’ s forced Smith to improvise .
Smith , a Mississippi native who retains the lilt and the flattened sentence endings of rural hometown Holly Springs , began his career as a local news-affiliate reporter in Florida . He joined Fox News at its founding in 1996 and eventually came to have both daytime and evening broadcasts . In 1999 , he launched The Fox Report , the network ’ s flagship newscast and its version of what the broadcast networks do at 6:30 p.m. Smith became Fox ’ s closest analogue to the classic voice-of-God newsman . In 2013 , the evening show was cancelled . “ There used to be a thought that , hey , we need a nightly newscast later in the day , ” says Wallace . “ Those patterns have changed , just with the way we consume media. ” Now Fox ’ s night-time slate is dominated by opinion—the fire-breathing sort practiced by Tucker Carlson at eight , Sean Hannity at nine , and Laura Ingraham at ten .
Their coexistence with Smith is increasingly uneasy . In November 2017 , Smith briskly and effectively debunked the “ Uranium One ” conspiracy theory , a particular bugbear of Hannity ’ s . Reporting live on the air in the hours after the February school shooting in Parkland , Fla. , Smith read a list of schools that had endured fatal gun violence since Columbine . And this month , Smith said on-air that the president , who ’ d called for raising the age limit for buying firearms , had caved under political pressure : “ The president told the kids at Parkland , ‘ I ’ ll go strong on this , I ’ ll work on this age thing , ’ ” Smith said . “ And then he met with the NRA. ” Smith ’ s treatment of these stories—and how that treatment differs from his opinion-host colleagues ’ —hasn ’ t gone unnoticed . Hannity , who wove the Uranium One scandal into his ongoing saga of Hillary Clinton ’ s mendacity , has called Smith “ so anti-Trump . ”
Smith says he ’ s unbothered by the divergence between his reporting and Fox ’ s opinion slate . “ We serve different masters . We work for different reporting chains , we have different rules . They don ’ t really have rules on the opinion side . They can say whatever they want . If it ’ s their opinion . I don ’ t really watch a lot of opinion programming . I ’ m busy. ” He laughs , enigmatic punctuation that may indicate he ’ d been trying for a bon mot , or might just be a Mississippi-nice way of indicating he ’ s said what he ’ s going to say , bless my heart .
But Smith isn ’ t kidding when he says he ’ s busy . He has his hour and leads the unit of 17 staffers that breaks into coverage when major news occurs . He ’ s the person Fox News viewers see during a hurricane , or a school shooting . “ I ’ ve been telling people about what ’ s happening for a long , long , long time , ” Smith says . He takes a long and considered pause . “ I know that when something big happens , people turn to us . I think people always will . People who maybe aren ’ t with us all the time who aren ’ t regular watchers , maybe there is some sort of confusion about what ’ s opinion and what ’ s news , but I think our audience understands the difference and comes to us when they need us . ”
Unlike some portion of the audience that reflexively switches on Fox News , Smith is disengaged by politics . “ I get it , ” he says , “ that some of our opinion programming is there strictly to be entertaining . I get that . I don ’ t work there . I wouldn ’ t work there . I don ’ t want to sit around and yell at each other and talk about your philosophy and my philosophy . That sounds horrible to me. ” He cites his values growing up : “ You don ’ t talk about your money , you don ’ t talk about your politics , and you don ’ t talk about your sex . Right now , everyone wants to talk about those things , and I ’ m not one of them . Not going to do it . ”
This becomes clear in our first meeting when I broach his personal life ; Smith , who ’ d been dogged by rumors for much of his career , publicly acknowledged he is gay in 2017 . “ I think that ’ s the part you like , ” he shoots back when I ask if his boyfriend of six years works in the news business . Some of the honey drips away from his drawl . “ I don ’ t mind talking about it . It ’ s just , you know , that ’ s just my personal life . And I ’ m not hiding anything . I have a longtime boyfriend and we ’ re as happy as we can be and we live a very normal life and go to dinner and go to games and see his family and see my family . It ’ s great for us . But I can ’ t imagine anyone else finding it interesting . ”
Smith isn ’ t the only anchor to profess a desire to avoid becoming the story , but his commitment to facts over feeling makes him an unusual fit for an era defined by news personalities . His opinion colleagues , geared to thrive in contentious times , fit the tenor of the moment more naturally . That he ’ s , to some portion of the Fox audience , become despised for telling them what they don ’ t want to hear is a frustrating part of the job . “ It depends on what you ’ re looking for , ” he says . “ Are you looking for news and information so that you can make decisions about your life and your family ? Or are you looking for your worldview to be confirmed ? For that second kind of viewer , when the facts fly in the face of your worldview , that can be unsettling . Sometimes , then , they don ’ t like me . And there are other times when the facts work beautifully with their worldview . Then , they ’ re very happy . ”
From its earliest days , Fox News has dazzled with its commitment to showmanship , from glimmering studios to vervy transitions between stories to well-put-together anchors ( a role the trim , tan and neatly groomed Smith fits into tidily ) . Wallace sees the network ’ s main competition as the entertainment industry . “ People may turn on the network and get pissed at whoever ’ s on , but the storytelling that we have and the way that we break stories down is so important and compelling , they don ’ t leave , ” he says . “ And when they do leave , they ’ re probably going to turn on Netflix . ”
What doesn ’ t show onscreen is just how much has changed since 2016 . The late Fox News Chairman and CEO Roger Ailes was forced to resign in July of that year for an alleged pattern of sexual assault in the workplace . ( He died in 2017 . ) Smith describes that period as “ the hardest time in my professional life . We were in Cleveland at the [ Republican ] Convention as our professional world was collapsing around us . We had become the news. ” The newsroom where researchers , reporters , and digital staff work was recently renovated with substantial input from 21st Century Fox and Fox News Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch . Completed only weeks before I visit , the revamp created an open office . The clear sightlines , with busy young reporters tapping away under various illuminated screens , is a powerful reminder of just what came before . Fox and other TV outlets were closed-door environments in which secrets could fester .
Fox News has been forced to grapple with systemic changes outside its doors , too . The network , which long prized a reputation earned in the Clinton era as a brash insurgent , is now the primary newsfeed for the President . Smith doesn ’ t know or profess to care if Trump watches his reporting . “ I have no idea . I hope not , I hope he ’ s busy . The president says he doesn ’ t have much time for television , I ’ ve heard him say that. ” Don ’ t we know Trump watches Fox ’ s morning opinion broadcast ? “ I know that he watches Fox & Friends in the morning , because he often tweets about it . But those aren ’ t the things I concern myself with . I try to find out what ’ s happening , as opposed to just listening to what they ’ re saying. ” Smith also shuts out the ascendant voices that have recently outflanked Fox ’ s opinion journalists on the right : Does he read the website Breitbart or listen to provocateur Alex Jones ? “ Nope , ” he says .
But many of the viewers he ’ s trying to reach do . And they ’ re not shy about their disapproval when Smith calls out a fiction . On my second visit to Smith ’ s studio , he alludes to this feedback : “ Wait ‘ til you see your reader email after this piece. ” He leaves his show ’ s Twitter account to his team , but says he is aware of how strongly voiced the critiques are .
Despite being the cable-news ratings leader , Fox News ’ audience is also old . The median Fox News viewer in 2017 was 65 overall , the same as MSNBC , and 66 in primetime , the highest of all cable news networks . “ I think that our audience skews conservative . We learn about our audience through research and data , ” says Smith . A 2014 study by Pew Research Center indicated Fox News was the most-trusted news source for “ consistently conservative ” viewers , edging out the Wall Street Journal , Breitbart , and the Drudge Report .
Smith ’ s generally straight-news broadcast doesn ’ t frequently upset those viewers ’ senses of self . But breaking news has a way of shaking up established agendas . The day after my first visit was the day of the school shooting in Parkland , Fl . News of the incident broke as Smith was preparing to go to air . Once again , the pace of events scrambled a plan that was already pretty seat-of-pants . Smith took to the air for three hours , during which he listed the shootings and asked , “ Why can ’ t they put the best and the brightest together to research it and figure it out and help us stop it ? [ We ’ re ] failing our children . ”
The question resonated in part because Smith was , at that moment , the voice most widely heard . Perpetually ahead in the ratings , he was being watched by 3.3 million viewers in the 5 p.m. hour , compared to just under 1.6 million watching Wolf Blitzer on CNN . Smith ’ s critics , he says , told him that reading the list of schools was “ political . You ’ re making this political. ” Smith denies the charge : “ I guess , I know , that there are people who come at everything in a political way . I don ’ t . I ’ ve never really liked politics . I ’ ve always said that I thought politics in America was weird and creepy , and lacked a connection to reality . ”
On our first meeting , Smith had been energized : “ It ’ s more challenging , ” he says of reporting during the Trump presidency , “ and more challenging is more fun. ” On our second , he seemed depleted . Bringing up walking away from the news desk was less an idle threat and more of a contingency plan for coping with a different America . Describing the response he ’ s received lately , Smith says “ if we start making changes , if ratings go down or viewers scream too much and we make changes to accommodate , we are in extreme dereliction of duty . I can not do it . I will not do it . I ’ ll quit . I ’ ll stop doing it completely . ”
He ’ s decided to stay in some part because the times are so precarious . In his telling , before he signed his new contract , he was nervous about what would come on Fox ’ s air after he left . “ To stop doing it would be bad because I think that there is a need for it and I know the degree to which we care about it and focus on it and we want it to be as perfect as it can be . And I wonder , if I stopped delivering the facts , what would go in its place in this place that is most watched , most listened , most viewed , most trusted ? I don ’ t know . ”
On Smith ’ s primetime show , he used to do light stories from time to time . Wallace , the head of Fox News , noted that Smith is a weather obsessive : “ We were somewhere in L.A. and he told me some weird fact that there are 19 weather zones within two blocks in West Hollywood , and I was like , why do you know that worthless knowledge ? ” Asked to name one of Smith ’ s favorite stories , his executive producer Jon Glenn recalls the 2015 incident in which two llamas ran through suburban Phoenix . “ I know we ’ re all going through this whole long journey of politics , ” Glenn says , “ but look , there are some freaking llamas running down the street in Arizona ! ”
Smith remembers this fondly too . “ We would try to be entertaining with them , because I always felt like you should get some dessert with the meal . That seems like an eternity ago. ” The people tuning into Fox and writing him emails and tweets don ’ t want dessert in the form of a cute story . More and more , they seem to crave red meat , an appetite that much on Fox News ’ air has helped to nurture . But Smith can ’ t brook shifting his reporting . “ I think we have to make the wall between news and opinion as high and as thick and as impenetrable as possible . And I try to do that . And if I were doing this , there would be a lot more fact-based reporting , but it ’ s available for people who want it . I don ’ t know how badly they want it . ”
Now the pressures are greater , and the landscape is bleaker . Smith may still be seeing things he ’ d never expected , but they all tend to be on one beat . “ I miss doing that thing I used to do but I like this thing I ’ m doing now , ” he says . “ I just wish everyone weren ’ t so angry about it all . I wish that we could have lighter moments and not always be on guard with each other. ” Even as he signs on for years to come , a solution seems to Smith far away . “ We ’ re not living normal lives , ” he says . “ We ’ re ingesting a lot more than I think is healthy. ” Which means ? “ This isn ’ t going to just go away , ” he says . “ It ’ s going to get worse . ”","In a Manhattan Fox News studio on a recent Tuesday in February, Shepard Smith sits ready to begin taping his 3 p.m. newscast.

And this month, Smith said on-air that the president, who’d called for raising the age limit for buying firearms, had caved under political pressure: “The president told the kids at Parkland, ‘I’ll go strong on this, I’ll work on this age thing,’” Smith said. “And then he met with the NRA.” Smith’s treatment of these stories—and how that treatment differs from his opinion-host colleagues’—hasn’t gone unnoticed. Hannity, who wove the Uranium One scandal into his ongoing saga of Hillary Clinton’s mendacity, has called Smith “so anti-Trump.”

Smith says he’s unbothered by the divergence between his reporting and Fox’s opinion slate. “We serve different masters. We work for different reporting chains, we have different rules. They don’t really have rules on the opinion side. They can say whatever they want. If it’s their opinion. I don’t really watch a lot of opinion programming. I’m busy.” He laughs, enigmatic punctuation that may indicate he’d been trying for a bon mot, or might just be a Mississippi-nice way of indicating he’s said what he’s going to say, bless my heart.

But Smith isn’t kidding when he says he’s busy. He has his hour and leads the unit of 17 staffers that breaks into coverage when major news occurs. He’s the person Fox News viewers see during a hurricane, or a school shooting. “I’ve been telling people about what’s happening for a long, long, long time,” Smith says. He takes a long and considered pause. “I know that when something big happens, people turn to us. I think people always will. People who maybe aren’t with us all the time who aren’t regular watchers, maybe there is some sort of confusion about what’s opinion and what’s news, but I think our audience understands the difference and comes to us when they need us.”

Unlike some portion of the audience that reflexively switches on Fox News, Smith is disengaged by politics. “I get it,” he says, “that some of our opinion programming is there strictly to be entertaining. I get that. I don’t work there. I wouldn’t work there. I don’t want to sit around and yell at each other and talk about your philosophy and my philosophy. That sounds horrible to me.” He cites his values growing up: “You don’t talk about your money, you don’t talk about your politics, and you don’t talk about your sex. Right now, everyone wants to talk about those things, and I’m not one of them. Not going to do it.”

This becomes clear in our first meeting when I broach his personal life; Smith, who’d been dogged by rumors for much of his career, publicly acknowledged he is gay in 2017. “I think that’s the part you like,” he shoots back when I ask if his boyfriend of six years works in the news business. Some of the honey drips away from his drawl. “I don’t mind talking about it. It’s just, you know, that’s just my personal life. And I’m not hiding anything. I have a longtime boyfriend and we’re as happy as we can be and we live a very normal life and go to dinner and go to games and see his family and see my family. It’s great for us. But I can’t imagine anyone else finding it interesting.”

Smith isn’t the only anchor to profess a desire to avoid becoming the story, but his commitment to facts over feeling makes him an unusual fit for an era defined by news personalities. His opinion colleagues, geared to thrive in contentious times, fit the tenor of the moment more naturally. That he’s, to some portion of the Fox audience, become despised for telling them what they don’t want to hear is a frustrating part of the job. “It depends on what you’re looking for,” he says. “Are you looking for news and information so that you can make decisions about your life and your family? Or are you looking for your worldview to be confirmed? For that second kind of viewer, when the facts fly in the face of your worldview, that can be unsettling. Sometimes, then, they don’t like me. And there are other times when the facts work beautifully with their worldview. Then, they’re very happy.”

From its earliest days, Fox News has dazzled with its commitment to showmanship, from glimmering studios to vervy transitions between stories to well-put-together anchors (a role the trim, tan and neatly groomed Smith fits into tidily). Wallace sees the network’s main competition as the entertainment industry. “People may turn on the network and get pissed at whoever’s on, but the storytelling that we have and the way that we break stories down is so important and compelling, they don’t leave,” he says. “And when they do leave, they’re probably going to turn on Netflix.”

What doesn’t show onscreen is just how much has changed since 2016. The late Fox News Chairman and CEO Roger Ailes was forced to resign in July of that year for an alleged pattern of sexual assault in the workplace. (He died in 2017.) Smith describes that period as “the hardest time in my professional life. We were in Cleveland at the [Republican] Convention as our professional world was collapsing around us. We had become the news.” The newsroom where researchers, reporters, and digital staff work was recently renovated with substantial input from 21st Century Fox and Fox News Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch. Completed only weeks before I visit, the revamp created an open office. The clear sightlines, with busy young reporters tapping away under various illuminated screens, is a powerful reminder of just what came before. Fox and other TV outlets were closed-door environments in which secrets could fester.

Fox News has been forced to grapple with systemic changes outside its doors, too. The network, which long prized a reputation earned in the Clinton era as a brash insurgent, is now the primary newsfeed for the President. Smith doesn’t know or profess to care if Trump watches his reporting. “I have no idea. I hope not, I hope he’s busy. The president says he doesn’t have much time for television, I’ve heard him say that.” Don’t we know Trump watches Fox’s morning opinion broadcast? “I know that he watches Fox & Friends in the morning, because he often tweets about it. But those aren’t the things I concern myself with. I try to find out what’s happening, as opposed to just listening to what they’re saying.” Smith also shuts out the ascendant voices that have recently outflanked Fox’s opinion journalists on the right: Does he read the website Breitbart or listen to provocateur Alex Jones? “Nope,” he says.

But many of the viewers he’s trying to reach do. And they’re not shy about their disapproval when Smith calls out a fiction. On my second visit to Smith’s studio, he alludes to this feedback: “Wait ‘til you see your reader email after this piece.” He leaves his show’s Twitter account to his team, but says he is aware of how strongly voiced the critiques are.

Despite being the cable-news ratings leader, Fox News’ audience is also old. The median Fox News viewer in 2017 was 65 overall, the same as MSNBC, and 66 in primetime, the highest of all cable news networks. “I think that our audience skews conservative. We learn about our audience through research and data,” says Smith. A 2014 study by Pew Research Center indicated Fox News was the most-trusted news source for “consistently conservative” viewers, edging out the Wall Street Journal, Breitbart, and the Drudge Report.

Smith’s generally straight-news broadcast doesn’t frequently upset those viewers’ senses of self. But breaking news has a way of shaking up established agendas. The day after my first visit was the day of the school shooting in Parkland, Fl. News of the incident broke as Smith was preparing to go to air. Once again, the pace of events scrambled a plan that was already pretty seat-of-pants. Smith took to the air for three hours, during which he listed the shootings and asked, “Why can’t they put the best and the brightest together to research it and figure it out and help us stop it? [We’re] failing our children.”

The question resonated in part because Smith was, at that moment, the voice most widely heard. Perpetually ahead in the ratings, he was being watched by 3.3 million viewers in the 5 p.m. hour, compared to just under 1.6 million watching Wolf Blitzer on CNN. Smith’s critics, he says, told him that reading the list of schools was “ political. You’re making this political.” Smith denies the charge: “I guess, I know, that there are people who come at everything in a political way. I don’t. I’ve never really liked politics. I’ve always said that I thought politics in America was weird and creepy, and lacked a connection to reality.”

On our first meeting, Smith had been energized: “It’s more challenging,” he says of reporting during the Trump presidency, “and more challenging is more fun.” On our second, he seemed depleted. Bringing up walking away from the news desk was less an idle threat and more of a contingency plan for coping with a different America. Describing the response he’s received lately, Smith says “if we start making changes, if ratings go down or viewers scream too much and we make changes to accommodate, we are in extreme dereliction of duty. I cannot do it. I will not do it. I’ll quit. I’ll stop doing it completely.”

Andres Kudacki for TIME

He’s decided to stay in some part because the times are so precarious. In his telling, before he signed his new contract, he was nervous about what would come on Fox’s air after he left. “To stop doing it would be bad because I think that there is a need for it and I know the degree to which we care about it and focus on it and we want it to be as perfect as it can be. And I wonder, if I stopped delivering the facts, what would go in its place in this place that is most watched, most listened, most viewed, most trusted? I don’t know.”

On Smith’s primetime show, he used to do light stories from time to time. Wallace, the head of Fox News, noted that Smith is a weather obsessive: “We were somewhere in L.A. and he told me some weird fact that there are 19 weather zones within two blocks in West Hollywood, and I was like, why do you know that worthless knowledge?” Asked to name one of Smith’s favorite stories, his executive producer Jon Glenn recalls the 2015 incident in which two llamas ran through suburban Phoenix. “I know we’re all going through this whole long journey of politics,” Glenn says, “but look, there are some freaking llamas running down the street in Arizona!”

Smith remembers this fondly too. “We would try to be entertaining with them, because I always felt like you should get some dessert with the meal. That seems like an eternity ago.” The people tuning into Fox and writing him emails and tweets don’t want dessert in the form of a cute story. More and more, they seem to crave red meat, an appetite that much on Fox News’ air has helped to nurture. But Smith can’t brook shifting his reporting. “I think we have to make the wall between news and opinion as high and as thick and as impenetrable as possible. And I try to do that. And if I were doing this, there would be a lot more fact-based reporting, but it’s available for people who want it. I don’t know how badly they want it.”

Now the pressures are greater, and the landscape is bleaker. Smith may still be seeing things he’d never expected, but they all tend to be on one beat. “I miss doing that thing I used to do but I like this thing I’m doing now,” he says. “I just wish everyone weren’t so angry about it all. I wish that we could have lighter moments and not always be on guard with each other.” Even as he signs on for years to come, a solution seems to Smith far away. “We’re not living normal lives,” he says. “We’re ingesting a lot more than I think is healthy.” Which means? “This isn’t going to just go away,” he says. “It’s going to get worse.”

media_bias,USA TODAY,1,https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/04/29/joe-biden-sexual-assault-allegation-tara-reade-column/3046962001/,Why I'm skeptical about Reade's sexual assault claim against Biden: Ex-prosecutor,2020-04-29,,"During 28 years as a state and federal prosecutor , I prosecuted a lot of sexual assault cases . The vast majority came early in my career , when I was a young attorney at a prosecutor ’ s office outside Detroit .
A year ago , Tara Reade accused former Vice President Joe Biden of touching her shoulder and neck in a way that made her uncomfortable , when she worked for him as a staff assistant in 1993 . Then last month , Reade told an interviewer that Biden stuck his hand under her skirt and forcibly penetrated her with his fingers . Biden denies the allegation .
When women make allegations of sexual assault , my default response is to believe them . But as the news media have investigated Reade ’ s allegations , I ’ ve become increasingly skeptical . Here are some of the reasons why :
►Delayed reporting … twice . Reade waited 27 years to publicly report her allegation that Biden sexually assaulted her . I understand that victims of sexual assault often do not come forward immediately because recounting the most violent and degrading experience of their lives , to a bunch of strangers , is the proverbial insult to injury . That so many women were willing to wait in my dreary government office , as I ran to the restroom to pull myself together after listening to their stories , is a testament to their fortitude .
Even so , it is reasonable to consider a 27-year reporting delay when assessing the believability of any criminal allegation . More significant perhaps , is Reade ’ s decision to sit down with a newspaper last year and accuse Biden of touching her in a sexual way that made her uncomfortable — but neglect to mention her claim that he forcibly penetrated her with his fingers .
As a lawyer and victims ’ rights advocate , Reade was better equipped than most to appreciate that dramatic changes in sexual assault allegations severely undercut an accuser ’ s credibility — especially when the change is from an uncomfortable shoulder touch to vaginal penetration .
►Implausible explanation for changing story . When Reade went public with her sexual assault allegation in March , she said she wanted to do it in an interview with The Union newspaper in California last April . She said the reporter ’ s tone made her feel uncomfortable and `` I just really got shut down ” and did n't tell the whole story .
It is hard to believe a reporter would discourage this kind of scoop . Regardless , it 's also hard to accept that it took Reade 12 months to find another reporter eager to break that bombshell story . This unlikely explanation damages her credibility .
►People who contradict Reade ’ s claim . After the alleged assault , Reade said she complained about Biden 's harassment to Marianne Baker , Biden ’ s executive assistant , as well as to top aides Dennis Toner and Ted Kaufman . All three Biden staffers recently told The New York Times that she made no complaint to them .
And they did not offer the standard , noncommittal “ I don ’ t remember any such complaint. ” The denials were firm . “ She did not come to me . If she had , I would have remembered her , ” Kaufman said . Toner made a similar statement . And from Baker : “ I never once witnessed , or heard of , or received , any reports of inappropriate conduct ( by Biden ) , period . '' Baker said such a complaint , had Reade made it , `` would have left a searing impression on me as a woman professional , and as a manager . ”
►Missing formal complaint . Reade told The Times she filed a written complaint against Biden with the Senate personnel office . But The Times could not find any complaint . When The Times asked Reade for a copy of the complaint , she said she did not have it . Yet she maintained and provided a copy of her 1993 Senate employment records .
It is odd that Reade kept a copy of her employment records but did not keep a copy of a complaint documenting criminal conduct by a man whose improprieties changed “ the trajectory ” of her life . It ’ s equally odd The Times was unable to find a copy of the alleged Senate complaint .
►Memory lapse . Reade has said that she can not remember the date , time or exact location of the alleged assault , except that it occurred in a “ semiprivate ” area in corridors connecting Senate buildings . After I left the Justice Department , I was appointed by the federal court in Los Angeles to represent indigent defendants . The first thing that comes to mind from my defense attorney perspective is that Reade ’ s amnesia about specifics makes it impossible for Biden to go through records and prove he could not have committed the assault , because he was somewhere else at the time .
For instance , if Reade alleged Biden assaulted her on the afternoon of June 3 , 1993 , Biden might be able to prove he was on the Senate floor or at the dentist . Her memory lapses could easily be perceived as bulletproofing a false allegation .
►The lie about losing her job . Reade told The Union that Biden wanted her to serve drinks at an event . After she refused , `` she felt pushed out and left Biden 's employ , '' the newspaper said last April . But Reade claimed this month in her Times interview that after she filed a sexual harassment complaint with the Senate personnel office , she faced retaliation and was fired by Biden ’ s chief of staff .
Leaving a job after refusing to serve drinks at a Biden fundraiser is vastly different than being fired as retaliation for filing a sexual harassment complaint with the Senate . The disparity raises questions about Reade ’ s credibility and account of events .
►Compliments for Biden . In the 1990s , Biden worked to pass the Violence Against Women Act . In 2017 , on multiple occasions , Reade retweeted or “ liked ” praise for Biden and his work combating sexual assault . In the same year , Reade tweeted other compliments of Biden , including : “ My old boss speaks truth . Listen. ” It is bizarre that Reade would publicly laud Biden for combating the very thing she would later accuse him of doing to her .
►Rejecting Biden , embracing Sanders . By this January , Reade was all in for presidential candidate Bernie Sanders . Her unwavering support was accompanied by an unbridled attack on Biden . In an article on Medium , Reade referred to Biden as “ the blue version of Trump. ” Reade also pushed a Sanders/Elizabeth Warren ticket , while complaining that the Democratic National Committee was trying to “ shove ” Biden “ down Democrat voters throats . ”
Despite her effusive 2017 praise for Biden ’ s efforts on behalf of women , after pledging her support to Sanders , Reade turned on Biden and contradicted all she said before . She claimed that her decision to publicly accuse Biden of inappropriately touching her was due to “ the hypocrisy that Biden is supposed to be the champion of women ’ s rights . ”
►Love of Russia and Putin . During 2017 when Reade was praising Biden , she was condemning Russian leader Vladimir Putin ’ s efforts to hijack American democracy in the 2016 election . This changed in November 2018 , when Reade trashed the United States as a country of “ hypocrisy and imperialism ” and “ not a democracy at all but a corporate autocracy . ”
Reade ’ s distaste for America closely tracked her new infatuation with Russia and Putin . She referred to Putin as a “ genius ” with an athletic prowess that “ is intoxicating to American women. ” Then there ’ s this gem : “ President Putin has an alluring combination of strength with gentleness . His sensuous image projects his love for life , the embodiment of grace while facing adversity . ”
In March 2019 , Reade essentially dismissed the idea of Russian interference in the 2016 American presidential election as hype . She said she loved Russia and her Russian relatives — and `` like most women across the world , I like President Putin … a lot , his shirt on or shirt off . ”
Believe all women ? Now that Reade has accused Joe Biden of sexual assault , never mind .
Pivoting again this month , Reade said that she “ did not support Putin , and that her comments were pulled out of context from a novel she was writing , ” according to The Times . The quotations above , however , are from political opinion pieces she published , and she did not offer any other `` context '' to The Times .
Reade 's writings shed light on her political alliance with Sanders , who has a long history of ties to Russia and whose stump speech is focused largely on his position that American inequality is due to a corporate autocracy . But at a very minimum , Reade 's wild shifts in political ideology and her sexual infatuation with a brutal dictator of a foreign adversary raise questions about her emotional stability .
►Suspect timing . For 27 years , Reade did not publicly accuse Biden of sexually assaulting her . But then Biden 's string of March primary victories threw Sanders off his seemingly unstoppable path to the Democratic nomination . On March 25 , as Sanders was pondering his political future , Reade finally went public with her claim . The confluence of Reade ’ s support of Sanders , distaste for the traditional American democracy epitomized by Biden , and the timing of her allegation should give pause to even the most strident Biden critics .
►The Larry King call . Last week , new `` evidence '' surfaced : a recorded call by an anonymous woman to CNN 's `` Larry King Live '' show in 1993 . Reade says the caller was her mother , who 's now deceased . Assuming Reade is correct , her mother said : `` I ’ m wondering what a staffer would do besides go to the press in Washington ? My daughter has just left there after working for a prominent senator , and could not get through with her problems at all , and the only thing she could have done was go to the press , and she chose not to do it out of respect for him . ''
As a prosecutor , this would not make me happy . Given that the call was anonymous , Reade ’ s mother should have felt comfortable relaying the worst version of events . When trying to obtain someone ’ s assistance , people typically do not downplay the seriousness of an incident . They exaggerate it . That Reade ’ s mother said nothing about her daughter being sexually assaulted would lead many reasonable people to conclude that sexual assault was not the problem that prompted the call to King .
Reade ’ s mother also said her daughter did not go to the press with her problem “ out of respect ” for the senator . I ’ ve never met a woman who stayed silent out of “ respect ” for the man who sexually assaulted her . And it is inconceivable that a mother would learn of her daughter ’ s sexual assault and suggest that respect for the assailant is what stands between a life of painful silence and justice .
The `` out of respect '' explanation sounds more like an office squabble with staff that resulted in leaving the job . Indeed , in last year 's interview with The Washington Post , Reade laid the blame on Biden ’ s staff for “ bullying ” her . She also said , “ I want to emphasize : It ’ s not him . It ’ s the people around him . ”
►Statements to others . Reade ’ s brother , Collin Moulton , told The Post recently that he remembers Reade telling him Biden inappropriately touched her neck and shoulders . He said nothing about a sexual assault until a few days later , when he texted The Post that he remembered Reade saying Biden put his hand `` under her clothes . ”
That Reade ’ s brother neglected to remember the most important part of her allegation initially could lead people to believe he recounted his Post interview to Reade , was told he left out the most important part , and texted it to The Post to avoid a discussion about why he failed to mention it in the first place .
In interviews with The Times , one friend of Reade ’ s said Reade told her she was sexually assaulted by Biden . Another friend said Reade told her that Biden touched her inappropriately . Both friends insisted that The Times maintain their anonymity .
On Monday , Business Insider published an interview with a friend of Reade ’ s who said that in 1995 or 1996 , Reade told her she was assaulted by Biden . Insider called this friend , Lynda LaCasse , the “ first person to independently corroborate , in detail and on the record , that Reade had told others about her assault allegations contemporaneously . ”
But Reade alleged she was assaulted in 1993 . Telling a friend two or three years later is not contemporaneous . Legal references to a contemporaneous recounting typically refer to hours or days — the point being that facts are still fresh in a person 's mind and the statement is more likely to be accurate .
The Insider also quoted a colleague of Reade ’ s in the mid-1990s , Lorraine Sanchez , who said Reade told her she had been sexually harassed by a former boss . Reade did not mention Biden by name and did not provide details of the alleged harassment .
In prior interviews , Reade gave what appeared be an exhaustive list of people she told of the alleged assault . Neither of the women who talked to Business Insider were on that list .
The problem with statements from friends is that the information they recount is only as good as the information given to them . Let ’ s say Reade left her job because she was angry about being asked to serve drinks or because she was fired for a legitimate reason . If she tried to save face by telling friends that she left because she was sexually assaulted , that ’ s all her friends would know and all they could repeat .
Prior statements made by a sexual assault victim can carry some weight , but only if the accuser is credible . In Reade ’ s case , the statements coming from her friends are only of value if people believe Reade can be relied on to tell the truth , regardless of the light in which it paints her .
►Lack of other sexual assault allegations . Last year , several women claimed that Biden made them uncomfortable with things like a shoulder touch or a hug . ( I wrote a column critical of one such allegation by Lucy Flores . ) The Times and Post found no allegation of sexual assault against Biden except Reade 's .
It is possible that in his 77 years , Biden committed one sexual assault and it was against Reade . But in my experience , men who commit a sexual assault are accused more than once ... like Donald Trump , who has had more than a dozen allegations of sexual assault leveled against him and who was recorded bragging about grabbing women ’ s genitalia .
►What remains . There are no third-party eyewitnesses or videos to support Tara Reade ’ s allegation that she was assaulted by Joe Biden . No one but Reade and Biden know whether an assault occurred . This is typical of sexual assault allegations . Jurors , in this case the voting public , have to consider the facts and circumstances to assess whether Reade ’ s allegation is credible . To do that , they have to determine whether Reade herself is believable .
I ’ ve dreaded writing this piece because I do not want it to be used as a guidebook to dismantling legitimate allegations of sexual assault . But not every claim of sexual assault is legitimate . During almost three decades as a prosecutor , I can remember dismissing two cases because I felt the defendant had not committed the charged crime . One of those cases was a rape charge .
Reopen the Biden campaign : Ramp up social media and name a vice president now .
The facts of that case made me question the credibility of the woman who claimed she was raped . In the end , she acknowledged that she fabricated the allegation after her boyfriend caught her with a man with whom she was having an affair .
I know that “ Believe Women ” is the mantra of the new decade . It is a response to a century of ignoring and excusing men ’ s sexual assaults against women . But men and women alike should not be forced to blindly accept every allegation of sexual assault for fear of being labeled a misogynist or enabler .
We can support the # MeToo movement and not support allegations of sexual assault that do not ring true . If these two positions can not coexist , the movement is no more than a hit squad . That ’ s not how I see the # MeToo movement . It ’ s too important , for too many victims of sexual assault and their allies , to be no more than that .

This changed in November 2018, when Reade trashed the United States as a country of “hypocrisy and imperialism” and “not a democracy at all but a corporate autocracy.”

Reade’s distaste for America closely tracked her new infatuation with Russia and Putin. She referred to Putin as a “genius” with an athletic prowess that “is intoxicating to American women.” Then there’s this gem: “President Putin has an alluring combination of strength with gentleness. His sensuous image projects his love for life, the embodiment of grace while facing adversity.”

In March 2019, Reade essentially dismissed the idea of Russian interference in the 2016 American presidential election as hype. She said she loved Russia and her Russian relatives — and ""like most women across the world, I like President Putin … a lot, his shirt on or shirt off.”

Believe all women?Now that Reade has accused Joe Biden of sexual assault, never mind.

Pivoting again this month, Reade said that she “did not support Putin, and that her comments were pulled out of context from a novel she was writing,” according to The Times. The quotations above, however, are from political opinion pieces she published, and she did not offer any other ""context"" to The Times.

Reade's writings shed light on her political alliance with Sanders, who has a long history of ties to Russia and whose stump speech is focused largely on his position that American inequality is due to a corporate autocracy. But at a very minimum, Reade's wild shifts in political ideology and her sexual infatuation with a brutal dictator of a foreign adversary raise questions about her emotional stability.

►Suspect timing. For 27 years, Reade did not publicly accuse Biden of sexually assaulting her. But then Biden's string of March primary victories threw Sanders off his seemingly unstoppable path to the Democratic nomination. On March 25, as Sanders was pondering his political future, Reade finally went public with her claim. The confluence of Reade’s support of Sanders, distaste for the traditional American democracy epitomized by Biden, and the timing of her allegation should give pause to even the most strident Biden critics.

►The Larry King call. Last week, new ""evidence"" surfaced: a recorded call by an anonymous woman to CNN's ""Larry King Live"" show in 1993. Reade says the caller was her mother, who's now deceased. Assuming Reade is correct, her mother said: ""I’m wondering what a staffer would do besides go to the press in Washington? My daughter has just left there after working for a prominent senator, and could not get through with her problems at all, and the only thing she could have done was go to the press, and she chose not to do it out of respect for him.""

As a prosecutor, this would not make me happy. Given that the call was anonymous, Reade’s mother should have felt comfortable relaying the worst version of events. When trying to obtain someone’s assistance, people typically do not downplay the seriousness of an incident. They exaggerate it. That Reade’s mother said nothing about her daughter being sexually assaulted would lead many reasonable people to conclude that sexual assault was not the problem that prompted the call to King.

Reade’s mother also said her daughter did not go to the press with her problem “out of respect” for the senator. I’ve never met a woman who stayed silent out of “respect” for the man who sexually assaulted her. And it is inconceivable that a mother would learn of her daughter’s sexual assault and suggest that respect for the assailant is what stands between a life of painful silence and justice.

The ""out of respect"" explanation sounds more like an office squabble with staff that resulted in leaving the job. Indeed, in last year's interview with The Washington Post, Reade laid the blame on Biden’s staff for “bullying” her. She also said, “I want to emphasize: It’s not him. It’s the people around him.”

►Statements to others. Reade’s brother, Collin Moulton, told The Post recently that he remembers Reade telling him Biden inappropriately touched her neck and shoulders. He said nothing about a sexual assault until a few days later, when he texted The Post that he remembered Reade saying Biden put his hand ""under her clothes.”

That Reade’s brother neglected to remember the most important part of her allegation initially could lead people to believe he recounted his Post interview to Reade, was told he left out the most important part, and texted it to The Post to avoid a discussion about why he failed to mention it in the first place.

In interviews with The Times, one friend of Reade’s said Reade told her she was sexually assaulted by Biden. Another friend said Reade told her that Biden touched her inappropriately. Both friends insisted that The Times maintain their anonymity.

On Monday, Business Insider published an interview with a friend of Reade’s who said that in 1995 or 1996, Reade told her she was assaulted by Biden. Insider called this friend, Lynda LaCasse, the “first person to independently corroborate, in detail and on the record, that Reade had told others about her assault allegations contemporaneously.”

But Reade alleged she was assaulted in 1993. Telling a friend two or three years later is not contemporaneous. Legal references to a contemporaneous recounting typically refer to hours or days — the point being that facts are still fresh in a person's mind and the statement is more likely to be accurate.

The Insider also quoted a colleague of Reade’s in the mid-1990s, Lorraine Sanchez, who said Reade told her she had been sexually harassed by a former boss. Reade did not mention Biden by name and did not provide details of the alleged harassment.

In prior interviews, Reade gave what appeared be an exhaustive list of people she told of the alleged assault. Neither of the women who talked to Business Insider were on that list.

The problem with statements from friends is that the information they recount is only as good as the information given to them. Let’s say Reade left her job because she was angry about being asked to serve drinks or because she was fired for a legitimate reason. If she tried to save face by telling friends that she left because she was sexually assaulted, that’s all her friends would know and all they could repeat.

Prior statements made by a sexual assault victim can carry some weight, but only if the accuser is credible. In Reade’s case, the statements coming from her friends are only of value if people believe Reade can be relied on to tell the truth, regardless of the light in which it paints her.

►Lack of other sexual assault allegations. Last year, several women claimed that Biden made them uncomfortable with things like a shoulder touch or a hug. (I wrote a column critical of one such allegation by Lucy Flores.) The Times and Post found no allegation of sexual assault against Biden except Reade's.

It is possible that in his 77 years, Biden committed one sexual assault and it was against Reade. But in my experience, men who commit a sexual assault are accused more than once ... like Donald Trump, who has had more than a dozen allegations of sexual assault leveled against him and who was recorded bragging about grabbing women’s genitalia.

►What remains. There are no third-party eyewitnesses or videos to support Tara Reade’s allegation that she was assaulted by Joe Biden. No one but Reade and Biden know whether an assault occurred. This is typical of sexual assault allegations. Jurors, in this case the voting public, have to consider the facts and circumstances to assess whether Reade’s allegation is credible. To do that, they have to determine whether Reade herself is believable.

I’ve dreaded writing this piece because I do not want it to be used as a guidebook to dismantling legitimate allegations of sexual assault. But not every claim of sexual assault is legitimate. During almost three decades as a prosecutor, I can remember dismissing two cases because I felt the defendant had not committed the charged crime. One of those cases was a rape charge.

Reopen the Biden campaign: Ramp up social media and name a vice president now.

The facts of that case made me question the credibility of the woman who claimed she was raped. In the end, she acknowledged that she fabricated the allegation after her boyfriend caught her with a man with whom she was having an affair.

I know that “Believe Women” is the mantra of the new decade. It is a response to a century of ignoring and excusing men’s sexual assaults against women. But men and women alike should not be forced to blindly accept every allegation of sexual assault for fear of being labeled a misogynist or enabler.

We can support the #MeToo movement and not support allegations of sexual assault that do not ring true. If these two positions cannot coexist, the movement is no more than a hit squad. That’s not how I see the #MeToo movement. It’s too important, for too many victims of sexual assault and their allies, to be no more than that.

President Barack Obama is damaging his presidency, weakening America’s standing in the world, and displaying “inexplicable” incompetence.

The media figure making those accusations isn’t Bill O’Reilly or Rush Limbaugh, Charles Krauthammer or Glenn Beck. The critic doesn’t host a right-wing talk show, anchor a Fox News program, or write for the pages of the Weekly Standard. In fact, he’s not even a conservative.

It’s Joe Klein, the Time Magazine political columnist. “Obama has lost some serious altitude: In the world, with the Congress, and most importantly with the American people,” Klein, a veteran journalist and political moderate, told POLITICO.

Klein isn’t alone: In recent months, and especially since the start of the Syria mess, Obama has been enduring some of the toughest and most widespread press criticism of his four-and-a-half years as president. It isn’t just coming from the usual suspects on the right. Increasingly, the skepticism is coming from the center and even from the left — from White House reporters, progressive editorial boards, foreign policy experts and MSNBC hosts.

And Obama has mostly himself to blame for the recent wave of media negativity (although the Republicans have been glad to lend a hand). To hear the press tell it, his handling of the Syria crisis has been confusing and contradictory at best, making him appear weak on the international stage. His administration’s persecution of whistleblowers and surveillance of the press are at odds with the promises he made as a candidate. His inability to push a progressive agenda through congress makes him appear ineffective.

That outlet was prominently in the news this week thanks to its “ bombshell ” story about President Trump and Michael Cohen : a story that , like so many others of its kind , blew up in its face , this time when the typically mute Robert Mueller ’ s office took the extremely rare step to label its key claims “ inaccurate. ” But in homage to BuzzFeed ’ s past viral glory , following are the top ten worst media failures in two-plus-years of Trump/Russia reporting . They are listed in reverse order , as measured by the magnitude of the embarrassment , the hysteria they generated on social media and cable news , the level of journalistic recklessness that produced them , and the amount of damage and danger they caused . This list was extremely difficult to compile in part because news outlets ( particularly CNN and MSNBC ) often delete from the internet the video segments of their most embarrassing moments . Even more challenging was the fact that the number of worthy nominees is so large that highly meritorious entrees had to be excluded , but are acknowledged at the end with ( dis ) honorable mention status . Note that all of these “ errors ” go only in one direction : namely , exaggerating the grave threat posed by Moscow and the Trump circle ’ s connection to it . It ’ s inevitable that media outlets will make mistakes on complex stories . If that ’ s being done in good faith , one would expect the errors would be roughly 50/50 in terms of the agenda served by the false stories . That is most definitely not the case here . Just as was true in 2002 and 2003 , when the media clearly wanted to exaggerate the threat posed by Saddam Hussein and thus all of its “ errors ” went in that direction , virtually all of its major “ errors ” in this story are devoted to the same agenda and script : 10 .

1 . Donald Trump Jr. Was Offered Advanced Access to the WikiLeaks Email Archive ( CNN/MSNBC ) The morning of December 9 , 2017 , launched one of the most humiliating spectacles in the history of the U.S. media . With a tone so grave and bombastic that it is impossible to overstate , CNN went on the air and announced a major exclusive : Donald Trump , Jr. was offered by email advanced access to the trove of DNC and Podesta emails published by WikiLeaks – meaning before those emails were made public . Within an hour , MSNBC ’ s Ken Dilanian , using a tone somehow even more unhinged , purported to have “ independently confirmed ” this mammoth , blockbuster scoop , which , they said , would have been the smoking gun showing collusion between the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks over the hacked emails ( while the YouTube clips have been removed , you can still watch one of the amazing MSNBC videos here ) . There was , alas , just one small problem with this massive , blockbuster story : it was totally and completely false . The email which Trump , Jr. received that directed him to the WikiLeaks archive was sent after WikiLeaks published it online for the whole world to see , not before . Rather than some super secretive operative giving Trump , Jr. advanced access , as both CNN and MSNBC told the public for hours they had confirmed , it was instead just some totally pedestrian message from a random member of the public suggesting Trump , Jr. review documents the whole world was already talking about . All of the anonymous sources CNN and MSNBC cited somehow all got the date of the email wrong . To date , when asked how they both could have gotten such a massive story so completely wrong in the same way , both CNN and MSNBC have adopted the posture of the CIA by maintaining complete silence and refusing to explain how it could possibly be that all of their “ multiple , independent sources ” got the date wrong on the email in the same way , to be as incriminating – and false – as possible . Nor , needless to say , will they identify their sources who , in concert , fed them such inflammatory and utterly false information . Sadly , CNN and MSNBC have deleted most traces of the most humiliating videos from the internet , including demanding that YouTube remove copies . But enough survives to document just what a monumental , horrifying , and utterly inexcusable debacle this was . Particularly amazing is the clip of the CNN reporter ( see below ) having to admit the error for the first time , as he awkwardly struggles to pretend that it ’ s not the massive , horrific debacle that it so obviously is :
Knowingly soliciting or receiving anything of value from a foreign national for campaign purposes violates the Federal Election Campaign Act .

CNN is leading the way in bashing BuzzFeed but it 's worth remembering CNN had a humiliation at least as big & bad : when they yelled that Trump Jr. had advanced access to the WL archive ( ! ) : all based on a wrong date .

That outlet was prominently in the news this week thanks to its “bombshell” story about President Trump and Michael Cohen: a story that, like so many others of its kind, blew up in its face, this time when the typically mute Robert Mueller’s office took the extremely rare step to label its key claims “inaccurate.” But in homage to BuzzFeed’s past viral glory, following are the top ten worst media failures in two-plus-years of Trump/Russia reporting. They are listed in reverse order, as measured by the magnitude of the embarrassment, the hysteria they generated on social media and cable news, the level of journalistic recklessness that produced them, and the amount of damage and danger they caused. This list was extremely difficult to compile in part because news outlets (particularly CNN and MSNBC) often delete from the internet the video segments of their most embarrassing moments. Even more challenging was the fact that the number of worthy nominees is so large that highly meritorious entrees had to be excluded, but are acknowledged at the end with (dis)honorable mention status. Note that all of these “errors” go only in one direction: namely, exaggerating the grave threat posed by Moscow and the Trump circle’s connection to it. It’s inevitable that media outlets will make mistakes on complex stories. If that’s being done in good faith, one would expect the errors would be roughly 50/50 in terms of the agenda served by the false stories. That is most definitely not the case here. Just as was true in 2002 and 2003, when the media clearly wanted to exaggerate the threat posed by Saddam Hussein and thus all of its “errors” went in that direction, virtually all of its major “errors” in this story are devoted to the same agenda and script: 10. RT Hacked Into and Took Over C-SPAN (Fortune) On June 12, 2017, Fortune claimed that RT had hacked into and taken over C-SPAN and that C-SPAN “confirmed” it had been hacked. The whole story was false:

9. Russian Hackers Invaded the U.S. Electricity Grid to Deny Vermonters Heat During the Winter (WashPost) On December 30, 2016, the Washington Post reported that “Russian hackers penetrated the U.S. electricity grid through a utility in Vermont,” causing predictable outrage and panic, along with threats from U.S. political leaders. But then they kept diluting the story with editor’s notes – to admit that the malware was found on a laptop not connected to the U.S. electric grid at all – until finally acknowledging, days later, that the whole story was false, since the malware had nothing to do with Russia or with the U.S. electric grid:

8. A New, Deranged, Anonymous Group Declares Mainstream Political Sites on the Left and Right to be Russian Propaganda Outlets and WashPost Touts its Report to Claim Massive Kremlin Infiltration of the Internet (WashPost) On November 24, 2016, the Washington Post published one of the most inflammatory, sensationalistic stories to date about Russian infiltration into U.S. politics using social media, accusing “more than 200 websites” of being “routine peddlers of Russian propaganda during the election season, with combined audiences of at least 15 million Americans.” It added: “stories planted or promoted by the disinformation campaign [on Facebook] were viewed more than 213 million times.” Unfortunately for the paper, those statistics were provided by a new, anonymous group that reached these conclusions by classifying long-time, well-known sites – from the Drudge Report to Clinton-critical left-wing websites such as Truthout, Black Agenda Report, Truthdig, and Naked Capitalism, as well as libertarian venues such as Antiwar.com and the Ron Paul Institute. – as “Russian propaganda outlets,” producing one of the longest Editor’s Note in memory appended to the top of the article (but not until two weeks later, long after the story was mindlessly spread all throughout the media ecosystem):

7. Trump Aide Anthony Scaramucci is Involved in a Russian Hedge Fund Under Senate Investigation (CNN) On June 22, 2017, CNN reported that Trump aide Anthony Scaramucci was involved with the Russian Direct Investment Fund, under Senate investigation. He was not. CNN retracted the story and forced the three reporters who published it to leave the network.

6. Russia Attacked U.S. “Diplomats” (i.e. Spies) at the Cuban Embassy Using a Super-Sophisticated Sonic Microwave Weapon (NBC/MSNBC/CIA) On September 11, 2017, NBC News and MSNBC spread all over its airwaves a claim from its notorious CIA puppet Ken Dilanian that Russia was behind a series of dastardly attacks on U.S. personnel at the Embassy in Cuba using a sonic or microwave weapon so sophisticated and cunning that Pentagon and CIA scientists had no idea what to make of it. But then teams of neurologists began calling into doubt that these personnel had suffered any brain injuries at all – that instead they appear to have experienced collective psychosomatic symptoms – and then biologists published findings that the “strange sounds” the U.S. “diplomats” reported hearing were identical to those emitted by a common Caribbean male cricket during mating season.

4. Paul Manafort Visited Julian Assange Three Times in the Ecuadorian Embassy and Nobody Noticed (Guardian/Luke Harding) On November 27, 2018, the Guardian published a major “bombshell” that Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort had somehow managed to sneak inside one of the world’s most surveilled buildings, the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, and visit Julian Assange on three different occasions. Cable and online commentators exploded. Seven weeks later, no other media outlet has confirmed this; no video or photographic evidence has emerged; the Guardian refuses to answer any questions; its leading editors have virtually gone into hiding; other media outlets have expressed serious doubts about its veracity; and an Ecuadorian official who worked at the embassy has called the story a complete fake:

3. CNN Explicitly Lied About Lanny Davis Being Its Source – For a Story Whose Substance Was Also False: Cohen Would Testify that Trump Knew in Advance About the Trump Tower Meeting (CNN) On July 27, 2018, CNN published a blockbuster story: that Michael Cohen was prepared to tell Robert Mueller that President Trump knew in advanced about the Trump Tower meeting. There were, however, two problems with this story: first, CNN got caught blatantly lying when its reporters claimed that “contacted by CNN, one of Cohen’s attorneys, Lanny Davis, declined to comment” (in fact, Davis was one of CNN’s key sources, if not its only source, for this story), and second, numerous other outlets retracted the story after the source, Davis, admitted it was a lie. CNN, however, to this date has refused to do either:

If you tell me something awful about Chris Hayes or Rachel Maddow , I ’ ll likely give it some credibility . I ’ ll look into it for myself and figure it out , but if you tell me Maddow is abusive to her maid or Hayes treats his show staff like indentured servant then for a second I ’ d probably think , “ That figures . ”
If I looked into it and couldn ’ t find anything or found it was from some random website or an anonymous tweet , I ’ d realize how crazy it was and be thankful I ’ d kept this “ information ” to myself .
But the initial impulse to believe it would be there . And I know I ’ m not unique .
Sadly , too many so-called adults involved in politics don ’ t share my willingness to keep my powder dry until I ’ ve verified information or at least found it from a credible source . A large portion of those people happen to be on the left . Many have media credentials .
When California Senator Dianne Feinstein spread vicious gossip this week about Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh from an anonymous source who won ’ t come forward and doesn ’ t want to be identified , it was Gere ’ s gerbil all over again .
The gossip spread and grew on social media . So-called “ news ” outlets wrote stories featuring rumors and wild speculation . They filled in the blanks with their own biases because it just HAD TO BE TRUE .
It was a disgusting smear tactic used as a desperate attempt to win a lost battle launched by a desperate politician being challenged from her left . And while conservatives said , “ If you have something , show me the proof , ” liberals declared there was no need for proof . They wanted it to be true so badly they made it so in their heads .
The Kavanaugh story wasn ’ t alone . This week saw another fake story about United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley and $ 52,000 taxpayer dollars . The waste was committed by the Obama administration at a time they knew Hillary Clinton was going to win and their extravagance would never be reported . Since Trump won , the New York Times implied it was Haley ’ s decision , naming her in the headline and burying the truth in paragraph six . Since most people don ’ t read beyond the headlines , the rumor born by the Times spread quickly .
The Times eventually added a note to the piece clarifying that Haley had nothing to do with the purchase . It didn ’ t clarify how the “ unfair impression , ” as they called it , came to be in the first place . But we know how it did – they found a way to write a story that reflected negatively on someone they disagree with politically and they took their shot . Many of the “ journalists ” who declared Haley a near-criminal didn ’ t even bother to explain .
The “ clarification ” came hours later . The lie had already metastasized and now resides in the heads of millions of liberals who “ knew ” she was corrupt because she wasn ’ t one of them . If the fact that the Obama administration was the guilty party ever finds its way into their fertile minds it won ’ t take root , it can ’ t . It doesn ’ t fit with what they want to believe .
Once something is on social media it becomes true for those willing to believe it . Whether it is or not isn ’ t even a secondary consideration . And in the age of President Donald Trump , liberals are willing and wanting to believe anything negative about anyone with an “ R ” as their political affiliation . This week gave us many examples . Next week is bound to bring more .
I detail this and similar tactics in my book , “ Outrage , INC. : How the Liberal Mob Ruined Science , Journalism , and Hollywood. ” I discuss my book with conservative icon Brent Bozell from the Media Research Center on CSPAN-2 ’ s Book TV program “ After Words ” today ( Sunday ) at 6:00 pm , 9:00 pm , and midnight eastern time . A full hour of me and Brent discussing the book and how progressive liberals have ruined these important institutions . Check it out , and order a copy of the book today . You ’ ll like both of them . Then tweet me your thoughts at @ derekahunter , I ’ m curious to read them . My wife and I are moving this weekend , we need a little more room before baby number 2 is born next month , and I need the distraction from a life in boxes .

If you tell me something awful about Chris Hayes or Rachel Maddow, I’ll likely give it some credibility. I’ll look into it for myself and figure it out, but if you tell me Maddow is abusive to her maid or Hayes treats his show staff like indentured servant then for a second I’d probably think, “That figures.”

If I looked into it and couldn’t find anything or found it was from some random website or an anonymous tweet, I’d realize how crazy it was and be thankful I’d kept this “information” to myself.

But the initial impulse to believe it would be there. And I know I’m not unique.

Sadly, too many so-called adults involved in politics don’t share my willingness to keep my powder dry until I’ve verified information or at least found it from a credible source. A large portion of those people happen to be on the left. Many have media credentials.

When California Senator Dianne Feinstein spread vicious gossip this week about Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh from an anonymous source who won’t come forward and doesn’t want to be identified, it was Gere’s gerbil all over again.

The gossip spread and grew on social media. So-called “news” outlets wrote stories featuring rumors and wild speculation. They filled in the blanks with their own biases because it just HAD TO BE TRUE.

It was a disgusting smear tactic used as a desperate attempt to win a lost battle launched by a desperate politician being challenged from her left. And while conservatives said, “If you have something, show me the proof,” liberals declared there was no need for proof. They wanted it to be true so badly they made it so in their heads.

The Kavanaugh story wasn’t alone. This week saw another fake story about United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley and $52,000 taxpayer dollars. The waste was committed by the Obama administration at a time they knew Hillary Clinton was going to win and their extravagance would never be reported. Since Trump won, the New York Times implied it was Haley’s decision, naming her in the headline and burying the truth in paragraph six. Since most people don’t read beyond the headlines, the rumor born by the Times spread quickly.

The Times eventually added a note to the piece clarifying that Haley had nothing to do with the purchase. It didn’t clarify how the “unfair impression,” as they called it, came to be in the first place. But we know how it did – they found a way to write a story that reflected negatively on someone they disagree with politically and they took their shot. Many of the “journalists” who declared Haley a near-criminal didn’t even bother to explain.

The “clarification” came hours later. The lie had already metastasized and now resides in the heads of millions of liberals who “knew” she was corrupt because she wasn’t one of them. If the fact that the Obama administration was the guilty party ever finds its way into their fertile minds it won’t take root, it can’t. It doesn’t fit with what they want to believe.

Once something is on social media it becomes true for those willing to believe it. Whether it is or not isn’t even a secondary consideration. And in the age of President Donald Trump, liberals are willing and wanting to believe anything negative about anyone with an “R” as their political affiliation. This week gave us many examples. Next week is bound to bring more.

I detail this and similar tactics in my book, “Outrage, INC.: How the Liberal Mob Ruined Science, Journalism, and Hollywood.” I discuss my book with conservative icon Brent Bozell from the Media Research Center on CSPAN-2’s Book TV program “After Words” today (Sunday) at 6:00 pm, 9:00 pm, and midnight eastern time. A full hour of me and Brent discussing the book and how progressive liberals have ruined these important institutions. Check it out, and order a copy of the book today. You’ll like both of them. Then tweet me your thoughts at @derekahunter, I’m curious to read them. My wife and I are moving this weekend, we need a little more room before baby number 2 is born next month, and I need the distraction from a life in boxes. Also, check out the interview I conducted with retired Army Ranger and bestselling author of “Outlaw Platoon” Sean Parnell on my podcast. It was a blast. Thanks for reading, back to the boxes for me…",www.townhall.com,right,EyF7IfhT7yyuROyx

Donald Trump was very good for the fake news business
Back on November 3 , Craig Silverman and Lawrence Alexander published a blockbuster story about the Macedonian teenagers who were running a range of pro-Trump fake news websites and making good money by doing it . Amusingly , the group was all concentrated in an obscure town called Veles , where local English-speaking youths worked together on pro-Trump propaganda .
The story made it clear that political convictions had nothing to do with the operation . Pro-Trump fake news was a moneymaking scheme and nothing more .
“ Earlier in the year , ” the reporters explained , “ some in Veles experimented with left-leaning or pro–Bernie Sanders content , but nothing performed as well on Facebook as Trump content . ”
Trump was good for the fake news business in part for the exact same reason he ’ s been good for the real news business — he ’ s a fascinating person and a skilled entertainer , whose unlikely rise to the presidency has been just flat-out weird . But he was also good for the fake news business for the specific reason that the real news about him was generally bad . In the real world , Trump did not receive any unexpected endorsements . On the contrary , the real news was that he pointedly failed to secure the endorsements of living former Republican Party presidents , about a dozen sitting Republican senators , and a wide range of other party elders .
What ’ s more , Trump ’ s support among conservative intellectuals , writers , and pundits was shockingly low for a Republican Party nominee .
And yet from the moment that Trump secured the GOP nomination , it was inevitable that tens of millions of Americans would vote for him even if he lost . That essentially created an underserved market of people psychologically predisposed to click on and share Trump-friendly news stories that outlets committed to accurate reporting were not generating .
After the election , a follow-up report from Silverman concluded that the most popular fake news stories had actually been more popular than the most popular real news about the election .
The revelation that fake news stories had become very popular during the election and that successful fake news stories were disproportionately pro-Trump , along with Trump ’ s unexpected election win , led to an enormous surge of interest in the topic of fake news .
One consequence of this was a growing interest in the idea that Facebook could and should do something to make its platform less polluted by fake news stories . Facebook itself has indicated that it is going to take steps in this direction , and it ’ s at least somewhat likely that we will end up looking back on the summer of 2016 as a temporary heyday of publishing deliberately false stories as a business strategy .
At the same time , “ fake news ” as a concept metastasized in two different directions .
One , exemplified by Craig Timberg ’ s November 24 Washington Post story “ Russian propaganda effort helped spread ‘ fake news ’ during election , experts say , ” moved away from a narrative in which Donald Trump was central to the fake news business model and toward a narrative in which fake news was central to Trump ’ s political success . Timberg ’ s story was heavily based on a report from a somewhat mysterious organization called PropOrNot , which “ identifies more than 200 websites as routine peddlers of Russian propaganda during the election season. ” Timberg reported that “ PropOrNot estimates that stories planted or promoted by the disinformation campaign were viewed more than 213 million times . ”
This rather striking conclusion turns out to have been generated by describing a fairly wide array of left-wing websites — including Naked Capitalism , Truthout , Truthdig , Consortium News , and CounterPunch — as belonging on a list alongside Russian state-owned media and fake news sites .
That led to the other direction , in which the term “ fake news ” has ( like its predecessor “ clickbait ” ) rapidly been watered down into a general term of disapprobation . Many jokingly referred to Timberg ’ s own story as an example of “ fake news. ” And now on Twitter , the hashtag # FakeNews is used indiscriminately , primarily by Trump fans , to refer to any news or opinion piece that they dislike .
The notion of an actual fake news story in which a person deliberately makes up a false story calculated for maximal virality has rapidly faded into the background .
While the Trump campaign was great for the fake news industry , the implication that fake news was critical to Trump ’ s electoral victory seems unsupported . The election was close enough that everything mattered , so it ’ s certainly possible that white Catholics who were duped into believing that Pope Francis had endorsed Trump swung three crucial swing states .
But it also seems clear that the impact of fake news , whatever it may have been , was minor compared with the impact — for good or for ill — of the traditional news media .
A team of researchers working for Gallup found that what Americans heard about Clinton during the campaign was overwhelmingly information related to emails . By contrast , they found , “ Americans ' reports of what they have read , seen or heard about Donald Trump over this same period have been more varied and related to his campaign activities and statements . ”
The stories about Clinton ’ s email server , the separate spate of stories about Clinton Foundation emails revealed through Freedom of Information Act requests , and the third spate of stories about emails stolen from John Podesta ’ s email account were not fake news .
They were very real stories that totally normal mainstream media organizations chose to make the focal point of their coverage of the 2016 campaign . This coverage , though extremely extensive , did an extraordinarily poor job of explaining the actual legal issue at stake in the server matter . Network television newscasts from ABC , NBC , and CBS chose to devote three times as much airtime to Clinton ’ s email server as they gave to all policy issues combined . The Associated Press ran a major investigative story into Clinton Foundation influence peddling that treated a meeting with a Nobel Peace Prize winner as evidence of an insidious pay-to-play scheme . The New York Times did a Clinton Foundation investigation that treated Bill Clinton successfully rescuing American hostages from North Korea as scandalous . The fact that public health experts believe the Clinton Foundation saved millions of lives , by contrast , played extremely little role in 2016 campaign coverage .
For Clinton and her closest allies and supporters , “ fake news ” makes a convenient boogeyman because it paints her essentially as a victim of circumstances beyond her control .
Whatever one makes of the media coverage of her email server and of the continued operations of the Clinton Foundation , those are both things that she really did do and that if she could go back in time she almost certainly would have handled differently .
By the same token , for journalists working at mainstream establishments , the focus on “ fake news ” is a convenient way to connect the dots between an electoral outcome most journalists deplore and larger trends in technology and media economics that most journalists also deplore .
But it was real news from establishment outlets that made the difference in this campaign . It was CNN that decided to sideline its usual stable of conservative pundits in favor of a Trump-friendly roster of Jeffrey Lord , Kayleigh McEnany , and Corey Lewandowski . It was network television news that decided Clinton ’ s private email server was a more important thing to cover than the policy stakes in the 2016 election . It was the New York Times that decided to dedicate 100 percent of its above-the-fold space to articles about James Comey ’ s content-free letter updating Congress on the discovery of new evidence in the email case that turned out to amount to nothing .
The sum total of this media coverage — real stories based on editorial decisions about how to weight and present real facts — was to give the public the impression that two similarly ethically flawed candidates were running against each other in an election with low policy stakes . The reporters and editors responsible for that coverage can reasonably ( if a bit absurdly ) consider themselves proud of the work that led the public to that conclusion , or they can consider themselves ashamed of it . But the idea that voters were moved by fake stories about the pope rather than all-too-real ones about email servers is a preposterous evasion .","Speaking in early December at a ceremony to honor Harry Reid’s retirement from the US Senate, Hillary Clinton took aim at a target that would have been totally unfamiliar to audiences as recently as the summer of 2016: fake news.

media_bias,Vanity Fair,0,http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/09/roger-ailes-fox-news-final-days,INSIDE THE FINAL DAYS OF ROGER AILES’S REIGN AT FOX NEWS,,"Condé Nast, Sarah Elliso, Sarah Ellison, Katey Rich","In the morning of July 6 , James and Lachlan Murdoch were on opposite sides of Sun Valley , Idaho . Lachlan was finishing a workout at the decidedly downtown Ketchum YMCA . James was hiking down a bike trail after attending an early-morning session at the annual Allen & Co. conference . Every July , the conference jams the small Friedman Memorial Airport with the Gulfstream jets of the world ’ s media and technology billionaires , who gather in the ski town to negotiate their own preservation . James and Lachlan had both attended the conference before , but they were always in the shadow of their father , Rupert Murdoch . This year was different . For the first time , they were there on their own terms , at least for the moment , and it might have felt as if they were finally operating by their own rules .
At a little after 10 A.M. , Mountain time , Lachlan pulled out his cell phone and dialed Julie Henderson , the executive vice president and chief communications officer at 21st Century Fox , the Murdoch family company , to check in . “ Have you seen the suit ? ” she asked . “ What suit ? ” he replied . Henderson explained that Gretchen Carlson , a former co-host of Fox & Friends , had sued Roger Ailes personally for sexual harassment .
Lachlan dialed James , who had been named C.E.O . of 21st Century Fox a little more than a year earlier . Lachlan , the older of the two , had contented himself with the role of executive co-chairman of Fox and co-chairman of its sister company , News Corp. “ Have you seen the lawsuit against Roger ? , ” Lachlan asked . James had not . The brothers had been rivals much of their lives , vying for the attention and good opinion of their father , the founder and executive chairman of both companies . The relationship between Rupert , who is now 85 , and his sons could be complicated . It could also be oddly corporate . It took a meal at the Allen conference in July 2013 for the three men to get together and hammer out how they would all share power at the top of the Murdoch companies . Rupert always did what he thought made sense for the business , and the sons sometimes ended up as collateral damage . Lachlan , for instance , had left for Australia in 2005 after Rupert sided with Ailes over his son in a Fox Television dispute . Rupert had always been protective of the boys , but it was not always clear that they were his top priority .
Now , unexpectedly , the sons were facing a test together : one of their father ’ s closest deputies was being accused of a very serious offense . The brothers had a long and fractious relationship with this man . James ’ s wife , Kathryn Murdoch , found Ailes particularly distasteful . When their promotions had been announced , in 2015 , Ailes had publicly said that he would continue reporting directly to Rupert , only to be brought up short : he would , in fact , have to report to Rupert ’ s sons . And at this moment , in July , as a crisis arose , Rupert himself was unavailable : he was in the air , on his way back from France , where he had been spending time on his boat in the Mediterranean with his fourth wife , Jerry Hall . What came next proved easier to accomplish because Rupert Murdoch was not immediately there to weigh in .
James and Lachlan agreed to meet back at the Sun Valley Resort , just north of Dollar Mountain , where they were staying , courtesy of Allen & Co. Julie Henderson forwarded the lawsuit to them and to Gerson Zweifach , the general counsel of 21st Century Fox , who was at his desk in New York . By Murdoch standards , Zweifach was a new hire . He had joined the company in 2012 , lured away from Williams & Connolly as Murdoch desperately sought help in containing the phone-hacking scandal in Britain , which was enveloping his newspapers there . The group arranged a conference call . Zweifach then contacted Fox News to ask about the circumstances of Carlson ’ s departure . He didn ’ t know Carlson or many of the other personalities at Fox News , which operated with great autonomy within the broader media conglomerate . Part of the reason for that was the nature of Murdoch ’ s laissez-faire approach to management , but part of it was also the nature of Roger Ailes , who fiercely guarded his business and his control over it . “ Leave him alone , ” Rupert used to say about Ailes , according to a former top executive . “ He knows what he ’ s doing . ”","I. “Leave Him Alone”

Henderson explained that Gretchen Carlson, a former co-host of Fox & Friends, had sued Roger Ailes personally for sexual harassment.

Lachlan dialed James, who had been named C.E.O. of 21st Century Fox a little more than a year earlier. Lachlan, the older of the two, had contented himself with the role of executive co-chairman of Fox and co-chairman of its sister company, News Corp. “Have you seen the lawsuit against Roger?,” Lachlan asked. James had not. The brothers had been rivals much of their lives, vying for the attention and good opinion of their father, the founder and executive chairman of both companies. The relationship between Rupert, who is now 85, and his sons could be complicated. It could also be oddly corporate. It took a meal at the Allen conference in July 2013 for the three men to get together and hammer out how they would all share power at the top of the Murdoch companies. Rupert always did what he thought made sense for the business, and the sons sometimes ended up as collateral damage. Lachlan, for instance, had left for Australia in 2005 after Rupert sided with Ailes over his son in a Fox Television dispute. Rupert had always been protective of the boys, but it was not always clear that they were his top priority.

Now, unexpectedly, the sons were facing a test together: one of their father’s closest deputies was being accused of a very serious offense. The brothers had a long and fractious relationship with this man. James’s wife, Kathryn Murdoch, found Ailes particularly distasteful. When their promotions had been announced, in 2015, Ailes had publicly said that he would continue reporting directly to Rupert, only to be brought up short: he would, in fact, have to report to Rupert’s sons. And at this moment, in July, as a crisis arose, Rupert himself was unavailable: he was in the air, on his way back from France, where he had been spending time on his boat in the Mediterranean with his fourth wife, Jerry Hall. What came next proved easier to accomplish because Rupert Murdoch was not immediately there to weigh in.

James and Lachlan agreed to meet back at the Sun Valley Resort, just north of Dollar Mountain, where they were staying, courtesy of Allen & Co. Julie Henderson forwarded the lawsuit to them and to Gerson Zweifach, the general counsel of 21st Century Fox, who was at his desk in New York. By Murdoch standards, Zweifach was a new hire. He had joined the company in 2012, lured away from Williams & Connolly as Murdoch desperately sought help in containing the phone-hacking scandal in Britain, which was enveloping his newspapers there. The group arranged a conference call. Zweifach then contacted Fox News to ask about the circumstances of Carlson’s departure. He didn’t know Carlson or many of the other personalities at Fox News, which operated with great autonomy within the broader media conglomerate. Part of the reason for that was the nature of Murdoch’s laissez-faire approach to management, but part of it was also the nature of Roger Ailes, who fiercely guarded his business and his control over it. “Leave him alone,” Rupert used to say about Ailes, according to a former top executive. “He knows what he’s doing.”",www.vanityfair.com,left,FyaSvh2icjpheEPF

John Daniszewski , the Associated Press vice president for standards , told the AP ’ s reporters and the countless journalists across the industry who use its stylebook to be clear about what the alt-right is to readers .
In a November 28 blog post with the new guidance , he wrote that a story ’ s initial reference of the “ alt-right ” — always in quotation marks — should be accompanied by a description to help readers understand that it is “ an offshoot of conservatism mixing racism , white nationalism and populism , ” or , to put it plainly , “ a white nationalist movement . ”
The New York Times was even stronger , instructing its writers to put the phrase in quotes or preface it with “ so-called. ” They must then clearly express what the group stands for , every single time , avoiding even letting the phrase stand alone without its link to white nationalism — even in a headline . Assistant masthead editor Clifford Levy shared the text of the new rules December 2 .
Let ’ s avoid using “ alt-right ” in isolation , without an explanation ( which means it will rarely be appropriate in headlines ) . We don ’ t need to adopt one-size-fits-all boilerplate , but any description can touch on some key elements , based on our own reporting about the “ alt-right ” : It ’ s a racist , far-right fringe movement that embraces an ideology of white nationalism and is anti-immigrant , anti-Semitic and anti-feminist . It is highly decentralized but has a wide online presence . Followers rail against multiculturalism and what they see as “ political correctness. ” So , for example , we might describe someone as “ a leader of the so-called alt-right , a far-right fringe movement that embraces white nationalism and a range of racist and anti-immigrant positions . ”
Guidelines from the AP , Times , and several others have arrived not a moment too soon . The alt-right movement had been earning plenty of attention throughout the election cycle , especially for its members ’ fervent support for Donald Trump .
But it was thrust into the spotlight the weekend after the election , when the National Policy Institute held an alt-right conference in Washington , DC . There , its leader Richard Spencer delivered remarks calling America “ a white country designed for ourselves and our posterity. ” In a video shared by the Atlantic , Trump ’ s victory and Spencer ’ s statements were cheered by the crowd with Nazi salutes and chants of , “ Hail Trump , hail our people , hail victory ! ” That Sunday evening , Trump announced his chief strategist and senior counselor would be Breitbart News editor Steve Bannon , who once bragged that his publication was “ the platform for the alt-right . ”
It quickly became undeniable that the alt-right was no longer a small-time fringe group that lived on Twitter and 4chan — it had evolved into a formidable movement with political clout in the White House , all while openly spouting messages of white supremacy , xenophobia , misogyny , and other extreme ideas . News organizations know their decisions about how to describe a modern group with an age-old racist message will shape how Americans understood it .
Journalists are weighing tradition and clarity when writing about the alt-right
Journalists can ’ t just use any words and description they want : They ’ re bound by professional ethics , tradition , and a strong incentive to avoid libel suits that could result if subjects are mischaracterized . That ’ s why a crime is always “ alleged ” unless there ’ s been a conviction , and even a confessed killer isn ’ t a “ murderer ” unless a court has said so . The result : In many cases , words used in reporting can seem weak compared with harsher terms that would resonate more with audiences and that many would argue are the truth .
Similarly , there ’ s a strong tradition in journalism of using the names that people and organizations want to be known by . “ It comes from the ideal of reporting the news as it is , not what you want it to be , ” Paul Levinson , a professor of media and communications studies at Fordham University , said .
In the case of “ alt-right , ” white nationalist Richard Spencer is credited with coining the term for the largely internet-based movement when he launched his Alternative Right blog in 2010 . Its core ideals are defined by white nationalism , racist ideas around white identity , and the preservation of Western civilization .
As ███ ’ s Dylan Mathews has reported , the so-called alt-right is a loose , online-based group that also includes people like libertarians and neoreactionaries in its ranks . A close look reveals it ’ s “ the product of the intersection of a longstanding , long-marginalized part of the conservative movement with both the most high-minded and the basest elements of internet culture . This and other distinctions , he argues , make it more complicated than warmed-over white supremacy .
But according to the Southern Poverty Law Center , the differences are insignificant . In fact , the name is one key part of a package , along with neat dressing and a clean-cut appearance , that makes the alt-right seem more palatable — and maybe even inviting — to those fed up with status quo conservatism . “ We have to look good , ” Spencer once told Salon ’ s Lauren Fox , explaining that no one would want to join a movement that appeared “ crazed or ugly or vicious or just stupid. ” In the SPLC ’ s view , the innocuous name and efforts to appear sophisticated have a clear goal : to make a kind of extreme racism that is generally regarded as destructive and immoral appear mainstream .
That ’ s why Sophie Bjork-James , a postdoctoral anthropology fellow at Vanderbilt University who studies contemporary white supremacist movements , says she ’ s “ very passionate about this idea that we need to be very careful with that term . ‘ Alt-right ’ sounds much more palatable than ‘ neo-Nazi. ’ It is an attempt at reframing a violent ideology as a palatable political position . ”
Despite concerns over the alt-right ’ s deceptive branding , many publications have found it sufficient to call the alt-right by its desired , Spencer-created name . Sometimes they ’ ll add that it is “ associated with ” or “ connected to ” white nationalism , white supremacy , or neo-Nazism — and sometimes they won ’ t .
Take , for example , the Washington Post ’ s November 22 profile of Spencer , which waited a few paragraphs after it first mentioned the phrase “ alt-right ” to mention that the group wanted to create an “ ethno-state ” that would banish minorities , and described the way critics characterized the “ alt-right ” — racist , white supremacist , neo-Nazi — but presented the characterizations as perspectives rather than facts . Or the November 23 New York Post story that called Spencer a white nationalist but described the alt-right in its chosen words : “ an independent organization dedicated to the heritage , identity , and future of people of European descent in the United States , and around the world . ”
“ Any effort to assign a different label to them can be at best challenging and at worst misleading and dangerous , ” said David Boardman , dean of the school of media and communication at Temple University . At the same time , he says , `` alt-right '' seems “ a woefully soft descriptor for the radical positions of this movement . ”
That ’ s why suddenly seeing “ alt-right ” everywhere ( without the “ white nationalist ” clarification , especially ) may be doing a disservice to readers . “ To call this the alt-right without defining it as white supremacist ideology is to normalize that ideology , ” said Bjork-James .
The problem isn ’ t just that shirking the “ white nationalist ” descriptor would leave readers less than fully informed . It ’ s that without this description , “ alt-right ” distracts from the agendas of those like Spencer in a way that may attract and radicalize new supporters .
“ My concern is that if we help to normalize these ideas as just part of the political spectrum , then it can make it seem less radical than they are and less connected to racial violence — because if people espouse racist ideas and racial rhetoric , there ’ s always some kind of a correlation to racist violence , ” Bjork-James said . “ And if we don ’ t describe them for what they are , we ’ re kind of giving other white people a path to think these are legitimate ideas and a chance that more white people will become radicalized in adopting these ideas . ”
Anti-hate activists and scholars of far-right movements aren ’ t the only ones who have these concerns or who have criticized the media for , in their view , giving in to the alt-right ’ s desire to look good .
Author Jodi Picoult and journalist Soledad O ’ Brien were among the many who used Twitter to urge that Spencer and his ilk be called “ neo-Nazis ” or “ white supremacists . ”

At least one publication , ThinkProgress , has decided to drop “ alt-right ” almost altogether . “ ThinkProgress will no longer treat ‘ alt-right ’ as an accurate descriptor of either a movement or its members , ” its editors wrote on November 22 . “ We will only use the name when quoting others . When appending our own description to men like Spencer and groups like NPI , we will use terms we consider more accurate , such as ‘ white nationalist ’ or ‘ white supremacist . ’ ”
There are journalism experts who agree that this would be the right move , even for more mainstream publications . Deborah Gump , director of the journalism program at the University of Delaware , says publications should drop “ alt-right ” completely : “ I ’ d suggest avoiding the term altogether . Don ’ t label . Explain a person or a group by their actions and statements . Let the facts speak for themselves , ” she said , pointing out that even Spencer himself once admitted in an interview with NPR that “ in some ways the ‘ alt-right ’ is arbitrary . ”
As Jeff Cohen , a media critic and associate professor of journalism at Ithaca College , pointed out , journalists actually do have some leeway to decide when replacing or rejecting names is appropriate .
“ An abject case was the US invasion of Iraq , which was dubbed ‘ Operation Iraqi Freedom ’ by the White House and Pentagon , and a couple of the cable news channels adopted that name as their very own name for their invasion coverage , ” he said . “ By contrast , some groups or movements are not afforded the right to name themselves — for example , you might see mainstream media reporting on ‘ a self-described democratic socialist ’ group or individual , as if to raise doubts about the legitimacy of the self-description . ”
What makes the difference ? In Cohen ’ s view , the degree to which political movements or groups or enterprises are allowed by mainstream media to get away with their own self-identification has to do with one main factor : “ how ‘ establishment ’ those groups are or how much those groups intimidate mainstream media . ”
Boardman from Temple University said there is , in fact , precedent for news organizations rejecting a self-assigned label , particularly when that label is politically loaded . One example is the term “ pro-life , ” which is the preferred label of many groups who oppose abortion rights . “ While most news outlets used that term in earlier decades , most now reject it in favor of ‘ anti-abortion ’ or ‘ anti–abortion rights ’ or ‘ anti-choice , ’ ” he said .
So far , no major , mainstream publications have abandoned or replaced “ alt-right ” in this way — but none have said they won ’ t link the alt-right to white nationalism either .
It looks like the growing consensus in the industry hovers around Cohen ’ s view : “ It would not seem unethical for skeptical or independent-minded news outlets to use phrases such as ‘ a white racist organization that describes itself as alt-right , ’ or ‘ a white supremacist group that describes itself as alt-right , ’ ” he said . This mirrors the AP ’ s commitment not to “ limit ourselves to letting such groups define themselves , ” instead reporting “ their actions , associations , history and positions to reveal their actual beliefs and philosophy , as well as how others see them . ”
For now , it seems that major publications will continue to use the term “ alt-right. ” That ’ s arguably a win for the group ’ s branding and recruitment goals . But there ’ s also a growing commitment to make it plain to readers what this modern name attempts to conceal : an age-old set of chilling beliefs and policy goals — the threats of which don ’ t change with labels .","Two of the standard-bearers for style and ethics across the news industry sent a message to journalists everywhere last week: When reporting about the group that’s dubbed itself “the alternative right,” make it clear that their movement isn’t simply a hip new twist on conservatism — and that, in fact, its racist beliefs and goals demand comparisons to America’s most infamous kind of hate groups.

John Daniszewski, the Associated Press vice president for standards, told the AP’s reporters and the countless journalists across the industry who use its stylebook to be clear about what the alt-right is to readers.

In a November 28 blog post with the new guidance, he wrote that a story’s initial reference of the “alt-right” — always in quotation marks — should be accompanied by a description to help readers understand that it is “an offshoot of conservatism mixing racism, white nationalism and populism,” or, to put it plainly, “a white nationalist movement.”

The New York Times was even stronger, instructing its writers to put the phrase in quotes or preface it with “so-called.” They must then clearly express what the group stands for, every single time, avoiding even letting the phrase stand alone without its link to white nationalism — even in a headline. Assistant masthead editor Clifford Levy shared the text of the new rules December 2.

media_bias,Politico,0,http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/11/donald-trump-conservative-media-charlie-sykes-214483,Donald Trump and the Rise of Alt-Reality Media,2016-11-25,"Jack Shafer, Natasha Bertrand, Charles Sykes","Charles Sykes is a conservative talk show host in Milwaukee , Wisconsin . He is currently working on a book entitled How the Right Lost Its Mind .
Earlier this year , I argued that the conservative movement did not merely have a Donald Trump problem—it had a media problem . As Trump slouched toward the nomination , he was backed by a conservative media that had successfully created an alternative reality bubble around his candidacy . When Trump claimed that “ thousands '' of Muslims in New Jersey had celebrated the attacks on 9/11 , for instance , callers to my show lined up to provide supporting evidence the only source of which was an echo chamber of partisan bloggers ; listeners chimed in with evidence they had seen on Facebook linking Ted Cruz ’ s father to the JFK assassination . Of course , we know the origin of that “ evidence ” was the National Enquirer . Crowd-sourcing has its limits .
As a # NeverTrumper , I had hoped that the election would prompt a moment of reckoning and introspection , not merely about conservative values but also the role of the conservative media . As someone who has spent much of his career promoting conservative values on my radio show , I was depending on it .
Clearly , that is not going to happen now . In fact , it ’ s going to get a lot worse .
Trump ’ s victory means that the most extreme and recklessly irresponsible voices on the right now feel emboldened and empowered . And more worrisome than that , they have an ally in the White House . For years , Rush Limbaugh has gibed about what he calls the “ state-controlled media ” —the fawning liberal news outlets that Limbaugh has long decried for their lack of critical coverage of President Barack Obama—but we may be about to see what one actually looks like—an alt-reality news outlet operating from within 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue . The new media will not only provide propaganda cover for the administration , but also direct the fire of a loose confederation of conservative outlets against critics and dissenters . Already , Fox ’ s Sean Hannity has urged Trump to freeze out the mainstream media and talk directly to the nation .
The “ fake news ” that we are now obsessing over is only the latest leading indicator of the perils of our new post-truth media/political world . Indeed , what we learned this year was that the walls are down , the gatekeepers dismissed , the norms and standards of journalism and fact-based discourse trashed .
All of this was a long time coming . For years , conservatives criticized the bias and double standards of the mainstream media ( and much of that criticism was richly deserved ) . Over the years , I used my own radio show on many occasions to call out the many failures of the liberal media . But the cumulative effect of the attacks was to delegitimize those outlets altogether and essentially destroy much of the right ’ s immunity to false information . The media ’ s rather dramatic failure to get the election right this year has made it only easier for Trump ’ s supporters to ignore anything that happens outside the right ’ s bubble .
So what is this brave new conservative media going to look like ? Probably more like Alex Jones than National Review . The appointment of Breitbart ’ s Steve Bannon as chief adviser to the president-elect was the new regime ’ s implicit imprimatur on the new conservative media . But perhaps the most revealing moment was Trump ’ s reported call , on the Monday after the election , to Infowars ’ Alex Jones to thank him for his support in the campaign .
Jones is not your garden-variety conspiracy theorist . He is a 9/11 truther , who believes the U.S. government conspired in the attacks to justify the creation of a police state . He has suggested that the government also may have been behind the bombings in Oklahoma City , which killed 168 people , and at the Boston Marathon , which killed three . And he has repeatedly suggested that the Sandy Hook shootings were a “ hoax , ” “ synthetic ” and “ completely fake. ” He also thinks the government wants to “ encourage homosexuality so people don ’ t have children ” and said that Hillary Clinton was “ a frickin ' demon and she stinks and so does Obama . ”
Jones has claimed that he has 5 million daily listeners to his radio shows , which he simulcasts on his website and extends through his YouTube channel . The Drudge Report routinely links to his stories . “ I think Alex Jones may be the single most important voice in the alternative conservative media , ” says Trump whisperer Roger Stone , who describes the conspiracy theorist as “ a valuable asset ” who will “ rally the people around President Trump ’ s legislative program . ”
When he called recently , the newly elected president of the United States promised Jones to return to his show . The Washington Post called the promise “ an extraordinary gesture for an incoming president whose schedule is packed with calls from world leaders and the enormous task of overseeing the transition. ” Perhaps more disturbing was the realization that the president-elect listens to this guy .
It ’ s possible that a Trump loss would have led to an exorcism of the worst elements of the conservative media . But they saw Trump ’ s victory as their victory too .

That was always a potent weapon , but now that one of the most aggressive godfathers of the movement has an office in the White House , the stakes have been dramatically raised .
In the past , the White House has had to be concerned about a more or less adversarial media , but we now have a president who will be able to call upon a passionately loyal alternative media to attack his enemies and provide air cover in adversity . Hannity made his role in this alternative media clear when he recommended that Trump fundamentally alter the White House ’ s relationship with the independent media . “ So until members of the media come clean about colluding with the Clinton campaign and admit that they knowingly broke every ethical standard they are supposed to uphold , ” he said , “ they should not have the privilege , they should not have the responsibility , of covering the president on behalf of you , the American people .

Don ’ t expect the same from the rest of the right media . We are already seeing the pivot from hosts and outlets who had insisted that because the election was a “ binary ” choice they had to downplay Trump ’ s flaws and instead attack Clinton . But , they promised , after the election they would hold Trump accountable . And , surprisingly , after Trump backed off his pledge to prosecute Clinton , Breitbart ran a headline calling it a “ broken promise. ” But whatever their pledges of independence and skepticism , the centrifugal forces of the newly emboldened right media are already proving too strong .
For the most part , conservative talkers quickly fell into line defending Bannon and ignoring Jones . At the conservative website Hotair.com , writer Jazz Shaw not only defended Trump ’ s pick of Bannon , but also lashed out at Trump critic David French , whom , Shaw writes , “ makes sure to work in the buzzword 'alt-right , ' as so many other Never Trumpers continue to do. ” He then dismisses concerns about the white nationalist movement , saying that the term was “ dredged up from the gutters of the internet and injected into the common parlance as a tool to smear Trump. ” ( Actually , the alt-right is quite real , as its leaders will tell you themselves . )
But Shaw ’ s larger point is that Trump critics now need to fall in line , stat . Before the election , critics of Trump were accused of trying to elect Clinton .

He is currently working on a book entitled How the Right Lost Its Mind.

Earlier this year, I argued that the conservative movement did not merely have a Donald Trump problem—it had a media problem. As Trump slouched toward the nomination, he was backed by a conservative media that had successfully created an alternative reality bubble around his candidacy. When Trump claimed that “thousands"" of Muslims in New Jersey had celebrated the attacks on 9/11, for instance, callers to my show lined up to provide supporting evidence the only source of which was an echo chamber of partisan bloggers; listeners chimed in with evidence they had seen on Facebook linking Ted Cruz’s father to the JFK assassination. Of course, we know the origin of that “evidence” was the National Enquirer. Crowd-sourcing has its limits.

As a #NeverTrumper, I had hoped that the election would prompt a moment of reckoning and introspection, not merely about conservative values but also the role of the conservative media. As someone who has spent much of his career promoting conservative values on my radio show, I was depending on it.

Story Continued Below

Clearly, that is not going to happen now. In fact, it’s going to get a lot worse.

Trump’s victory means that the most extreme and recklessly irresponsible voices on the right now feel emboldened and empowered. And more worrisome than that, they have an ally in the White House. For years, Rush Limbaugh has gibed about what he calls the “state-controlled media”—the fawning liberal news outlets that Limbaugh has long decried for their lack of critical coverage of President Barack Obama—but we may be about to see what one actually looks like—an alt-reality news outlet operating from within 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. The new media will not only provide propaganda cover for the administration, but also direct the fire of a loose confederation of conservative outlets against critics and dissenters. Already, Fox’s Sean Hannity has urged Trump to freeze out the mainstream media and talk directly to the nation.

The “fake news” that we are now obsessing over is only the latest leading indicator of the perils of our new post-truth media/political world. Indeed, what we learned this year was that the walls are down, the gatekeepers dismissed, the norms and standards of journalism and fact-based discourse trashed.

All of this was a long time coming. For years, conservatives criticized the bias and double standards of the mainstream media (and much of that criticism was richly deserved). Over the years, I used my own radio show on many occasions to call out the many failures of the liberal media. But the cumulative effect of the attacks was to delegitimize those outlets altogether and essentially destroy much of the right’s immunity to false information. The media’s rather dramatic failure to get the election right this year has made it only easier for Trump’s supporters to ignore anything that happens outside the right’s bubble.

So what is this brave new conservative media going to look like? Probably more like Alex Jones than National Review. The appointment of Breitbart’s Steve Bannon as chief adviser to the president-elect was the new regime’s implicit imprimatur on the new conservative media. But perhaps the most revealing moment was Trump’s reported call, on the Monday after the election, to Infowars’ Alex Jones to thank him for his support in the campaign.

Jones is not your garden-variety conspiracy theorist. He is a 9/11 truther, who believes the U.S. government conspired in the attacks to justify the creation of a police state. He has suggested that the government also may have been behind the bombings in Oklahoma City, which killed 168 people, and at the Boston Marathon, which killed three. And he has repeatedly suggested that the Sandy Hook shootings were a “hoax,” “synthetic” and “completely fake.” He also thinks the government wants to “encourage homosexuality so people don’t have children” and said that Hillary Clinton was “a frickin' demon and she stinks and so does Obama.”

Jones has claimed that he has 5 million daily listeners to his radio shows, which he simulcasts on his website and extends through his YouTube channel. The Drudge Report routinely links to his stories. “I think Alex Jones may be the single most important voice in the alternative conservative media,” says Trump whisperer Roger Stone, who describes the conspiracy theorist as “a valuable asset” who will “rally the people around President Trump’s legislative program.”

When he called recently, the newly elected president of the United States promised Jones to return to his show. The Washington Post called the promise “an extraordinary gesture for an incoming president whose schedule is packed with calls from world leaders and the enormous task of overseeing the transition.” Perhaps more disturbing was the realization that the president-elect listens to this guy.

It’s possible that a Trump loss would have led to an exorcism of the worst elements of the conservative media. But they saw Trump’s victory as their victory too. The newly weaponized conservative media genuinely believe that they have changed the paradigm of media coverage. In the new alt-reality bubble, negative information simply no longer penetrates; gaffes and scandals can be snuffed out, ignored, or spun; counternarratives can be launched. Trump has proven that a candidate could be immune to the narratives, criticism and fact-checking of the mainstream media. This was, after all, a campaign in which a presidential candidate trafficked in “scoops” from the National Enquirer. And got away with it.

No wonder “fake news” could flourish in this environment.

“Honestly,” Paul Horner, one of the creators of fake news, told the Washington Post last week, “people are definitely dumber. They just keep passing stuff around. Nobody fact-checks anything anymore—I mean, that’s how Trump got elected. He just said whatever he wanted, and people believed everything, and when the things he said turned out not to be true, people didn’t care because they’d already accepted it. It’s real scary. I’ve never seen anything like it.”

So when, three days before the election, a fake news site posted: “FBI Agent Suspected in Hillary Email Leaks Found Dead,” the story went viral, getting 560,000 shares on Facebook alone. Similar bogus stories were shared millions of times during the campaign. But this didn’t happen in a vacuum: Such stories fit easily into a media ecosystem that embraced an Alex Jones.

Ted Cruz .
It was easy to forget how controversial a figure Mandela once had been . People who referred to him in death as a communist or terrorist , or refused to pay him proper homage , were derided as marginal figures .
By the time of his death , Mandela 's greatness had become one of those rare topics about which media outlets felt no need to reflect any sort of dissenting opinion .
`` There 's an area of issues in society that we recognize in some way does n't need diversity , '' says Stephen Ward , a professor of journalism ethics at the University of Oregon . `` We can be one-sided , in a way . ''
Some subjects that invite no debate — like the world being round , or the evils of child molestation — seem like timeless truths . But many of them , such as Mandela 's storied role in changing South African society or the cause of civil rights in this country , had once been among the most contentious issues of the day .
As topics move from being controversial to receiving consensus approval , that raises a question about the nature of those judgments : do media outlets drive that shift , or merely reflect it ?
The 50th anniversary of the March on Washington last August was treated as a civic holiday , with three presidents in attendance and the issuance of a commemorative postage stamp . No reputable news outlet felt any need to quote someone holding a pro-segregationist point of view .
The original March on Washington , at which Martin Luther King delivered his famous `` I Have a Dream '' speech , was a bit different .
`` That sense that something remarkable had just happened was not shared everywhere , '' Gene Roberts and Hank Klibanoff write in The Race Beat : The Press , the Civil Rights Struggle and the Awakening of a Nation . `` The Clarion-Ledger in Jackson put on its cover a photograph showing the litter left behind and the headline 'Washington Is Clean Again With Negro Trash Removed . ' ''
Once federal laws were enacted protecting the rights of African-Americans to vote and prohibiting discrimination in public accommodations , politicians who had fervently opposed such changes essentially gave up .
After they stopped talking about the need for segregation , media outlets stopped treating that viewpoint as legitimate .
`` Those who were fighting an emerging consensus decide it 's no longer politically worthwhile to do so , '' says Daniel Hallin , a communication professor at the University of California , San Diego . `` At that point , journalists no longer feel there 's a dispute to cover . ''
That 's what often happens , Hallin says . Journalists reflect the balance of opinion among political elites , which in some cases shifts over time toward consensus .
`` Journalists do key on how the balance of political forces is seen , '' he says . `` If it looks like a battle is lost , it 's usually treated as lost . It 's different than treating it as a live battle . ''
Journalists do have a bias toward conflict — but do they have perfect timing ? Can they catch the exact moment whena society agrees that conflicting points of view no longer merit discussion ?
Supporters of same-sex marriage are convinced their position will eventually look like that of civil rights supporters in the 1960s , something history will judge to have been incontrovertibly right . The San Francisco Chronicle seems to believe that moment has already arrived .
When the Supreme Court issued twin rulings in favor of gay marriage last June , the Chronicle ran a banner headline on its front page trumpeting `` Double Victory , '' kicking off a large package of celebratory coverage .
Remember , one of the court cases threw out a California ban on gay marriage that had been approved by state voters just five years earlier . Nevertheless , Audrey Cooper , the managing editor of the Chronicle , says her paper 's coverage was `` perfectly appropriate . ''
She says on some issues , being `` right '' occasionally means being in the vanguard of change .
`` A media that hides behind the misguided notion that accuracy means giving equal weight to two opposing sides is not what this country needs or deserves , '' Cooper says . `` I do n't aim to have a newspaper that offends no one . I aim to have a newspaper that stimulates thought and debate while prioritizing accurate journalism . ''
Even if gay marriage supporters do have history on their side , they 're not there yet . Opinion has been moving in favor of same-sex marriage rights , but only a slim majority of Americans favor gay marriage at this point .
At any rate , tides can turn . Issues on which there was once no real disagreement can rise up to become matters worth fighting about .
That has happened already with same-sex marriage — supporters of which were mocked as fringe figures just a couple of decades ago .
And it can happen with matters on which there seems to be no room for debate . Namely , scientific theories .
The whole point of science is that ideas can be tested and verified independently . Yet that does n't mean they 'll maintain a political consensus .
Fewer Americans accept that human activity is linked to climate change than was the case a decade ago , even as the science becomes ever more certain . And a poll released Monday by the Pew Research Center showed that belief in evolution has dropped substantially since 2009 among Republicans .
Ward , the Oregon professor , says what 's important for journalists is to reflect `` an appropriate diversity of voices . ''
If enough Americans believe something , they ca n't be dismissed as fringe elements . `` The idea in political situations that there 's one truth just beggars belief , '' he says .
Yet when it comes to science , Ward says media outlets need to distinguish between public opinion polls and the scientific consensus . Falsely `` balanced '' stories — regarding vaccine safety , for example — can cause real harm .
Some outlets state bluntly there is a need for them to exercise judgment . And certainly it 's often proved worthwhile for journalists to remain skeptical when everyone else seems to have agreed on the `` truth '' about a matter .
`` Saying 'there 's no sign humans have caused climate change ' is not stating an opinion , it 's asserting a factual inaccuracy , '' writes Paul Thornton , the letters editor for the Los Angeles Times , defending the paper 's policy to deny climate-change deniers a forum .
But that does n't mean people wo n't write letters , or complain when the paper wo n't run them . On all sorts of issues , there are interest groups and ordinary citizens who adhere strongly to viewpoints that society at large seems to have dismissed .
In the age of Twitter , their voices can be loud .
`` On a lot of things , it 's much harder to achieve consensus , partly because you have partisan media which are often actively working to keep controversies alive that might otherwise die , '' says Hallin , the UCSD communication professor .","How Media Outlets Sometimes Agree To Agree

When former South African President Nelson Mandela died last month, he was celebrated around the world, lauded in this country by politicians who range as far apart on the ideological spectrum as President Obama and Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz.

It was easy to forget how controversial a figure Mandela once had been. People who referred to him in death as a communist or terrorist, or refused to pay him proper homage, were derided as marginal figures.

By the time of his death, Mandela's greatness had become one of those rare topics about which media outlets felt no need to reflect any sort of dissenting opinion.

""There's an area of issues in society that we recognize in some way doesn't need diversity,"" says Stephen Ward, a professor of journalism ethics at the University of Oregon. ""We can be one-sided, in a way.""

Some subjects that invite no debate — like the world being round, or the evils of child molestation — seem like timeless truths. But many of them, such as Mandela's storied role in changing South African society or the cause of civil rights in this country, had once been among the most contentious issues of the day.

As topics move from being controversial to receiving consensus approval, that raises a question about the nature of those judgments: do media outlets drive that shift, or merely reflect it?

Moving Toward Consensus

The 50th anniversary of the March on Washington last August was treated as a civic holiday, with three presidents in attendance and the issuance of a commemorative postage stamp. No reputable news outlet felt any need to quote someone holding a pro-segregationist point of view.

The original March on Washington, at which Martin Luther King delivered his famous ""I Have a Dream"" speech, was a bit different.

""That sense that something remarkable had just happened was not shared everywhere,"" Gene Roberts and Hank Klibanoff write in The Race Beat: The Press, the Civil Rights Struggle and the Awakening of a Nation. ""The Clarion-Ledger in Jackson put on its cover a photograph showing the litter left behind and the headline 'Washington Is Clean Again With Negro Trash Removed.'""

Once federal laws were enacted protecting the rights of African-Americans to vote and prohibiting discrimination in public accommodations, politicians who had fervently opposed such changes essentially gave up.

After they stopped talking about the need for segregation, media outlets stopped treating that viewpoint as legitimate.

""Those who were fighting an emerging consensus decide it's no longer politically worthwhile to do so,"" says Daniel Hallin, a communication professor at the University of California, San Diego. ""At that point, journalists no longer feel there's a dispute to cover.""

Leading From Behind

That's what often happens, Hallin says. Journalists reflect the balance of opinion among political elites, which in some cases shifts over time toward consensus.

""Journalists do key on how the balance of political forces is seen,"" he says. ""If it looks like a battle is lost, it's usually treated as lost. It's different than treating it as a live battle.""

Journalists do have a bias toward conflict — but do they have perfect timing? Can they catch the exact moment whena society agrees that conflicting points of view no longer merit discussion?

Supporters of same-sex marriage are convinced their position will eventually look like that of civil rights supporters in the 1960s, something history will judge to have been incontrovertibly right. The San Francisco Chronicle seems to believe that moment has already arrived.

When the Supreme Court issued twin rulings in favor of gay marriage last June, the Chronicle ran a banner headline on its front page trumpeting ""Double Victory,"" kicking off a large package of celebratory coverage.

Remember, one of the court cases threw out a California ban on gay marriage that had been approved by state voters just five years earlier. Nevertheless, Audrey Cooper, the managing editor of the Chronicle, says her paper's coverage was ""perfectly appropriate.""

She says on some issues, being ""right"" occasionally means being in the vanguard of change.

""A media that hides behind the misguided notion that accuracy means giving equal weight to two opposing sides is not what this country needs or deserves,"" Cooper says. ""I don't aim to have a newspaper that offends no one. I aim to have a newspaper that stimulates thought and debate while prioritizing accurate journalism.""

The Problem With Science

Even if gay marriage supporters do have history on their side, they're not there yet. Opinion has been moving in favor of same-sex marriage rights, but only a slim majority of Americans favor gay marriage at this point.

At any rate, tides can turn. Issues on which there was once no real disagreement can rise up to become matters worth fighting about.

That has happened already with same-sex marriage — supporters of which were mocked as fringe figures just a couple of decades ago.

And it can happen with matters on which there seems to be no room for debate. Namely, scientific theories.

The whole point of science is that ideas can be tested and verified independently. Yet that doesn't mean they'll maintain a political consensus.

Fewer Americans accept that human activity is linked to climate change than was the case a decade ago, even as the science becomes ever more certain. And a poll released Monday by the Pew Research Center showed that belief in evolution has dropped substantially since 2009 among Republicans.

Hearing Many Voices

Ward, the Oregon professor, says what's important for journalists is to reflect ""an appropriate diversity of voices.""

If enough Americans believe something, they can't be dismissed as fringe elements. ""The idea in political situations that there's one truth just beggars belief,"" he says.

Yet when it comes to science, Ward says media outlets need to distinguish between public opinion polls and the scientific consensus. Falsely ""balanced"" stories — regarding vaccine safety, for example — can cause real harm.

Some outlets state bluntly there is a need for them to exercise judgment. And certainly it's often proved worthwhile for journalists to remain skeptical when everyone else seems to have agreed on the ""truth"" about a matter.

""Saying 'there's no sign humans have caused climate change' is not stating an opinion, it's asserting a factual inaccuracy,"" writes Paul Thornton, the letters editor for the Los Angeles Times, defending the paper's policy to deny climate-change deniers a forum.

But that doesn't mean people won't write letters, or complain when the paper won't run them. On all sorts of issues, there are interest groups and ordinary citizens who adhere strongly to viewpoints that society at large seems to have dismissed.

In the age of Twitter, their voices can be loud.

""On a lot of things, it's much harder to achieve consensus, partly because you have partisan media which are often actively working to keep controversies alive that might otherwise die,"" says Hallin, the UCSD communication professor.",www.npr.org,center,esJZIHuskLb2H6UW

That remarkable fact underscores how virtually unchallenged Clinton has been on the advertising airwaves , as Democratic and Republican strategists alike say she has gone deeper into the election calendar than any non-incumbent president they can remember in the modern era without sustained , paid opposition on television .
Donald Trump began buying his first TV ads late last week , a nearly $ 5 million buy across four battleground states , contrasting his immigration plans with Clinton ’ s . But Trump waited for more than 100 days after he became the presumptive GOP nominee to buy his first anti-Clinton ad — more days than he now has left until the November election . And even as he has taken to TV , Trump and his allies are being out-advertised by Clinton and her super PAC supporters .
So far , Clinton has had to withstand in the general election less than one-third of the $ 50 million that Rubio ’ s campaign claimed he faced in negative ads during the GOP primary . She ’ s endured so little in paid attacks that some current Senate candidates have actually faced a bigger barrage of negative ads in their states than Clinton has nationwide .
“ It ’ s astounding that there would be no serious advertising after he secured the nomination , ” Bob Shrum , a Democratic strategist and veteran of multiple presidential campaigns , said of Trump and the Republicans . “ It ’ s so minor compared to what happened to other campaigns in other years . ”
Trump , of course , has run his campaign like no other candidate in other years , relying heavily on his celebrity and media to broadcast his message to the public for free . His ability to dominate cable and the media conversation proved potent in the primaries and has given him an unparalleled megaphone during the early stages of the general election to broadcast his “ Crooked Hillary ” broadsides against Clinton .
Still , the disparity in paid advertising — where campaigns can deliver targeted , succinct messages repetitively — is striking .
According to Advertising Analytics , a firm which tracks both the number and content of all political ads aired on broadcast television and national cable , Clinton and her main super PAC had run more than 110,000 ads since she became the presumptive Democratic nominee , as of the end of last week .

First , she faced a primary opponent , Bernie Sanders , who eschewed negative campaigning . Sanders spent more on TV ads as of mid-May than any other presidential candidate , according to the Wesleyan Media Project , but had not attacked Clinton by name in any of his more than $ 73 million in television ads , though some took indirect swipes at her , such as for speaking fees .
Second , the Republicans nominated a self-described billionaire who had not built a fundraising apparatus during the primary and refused to tap his personal fortune for ads after he secured the nomination . “ Do I want to sell a couple of buildings and self-fund ? ” Trump said on MSNBC on May 3 , his first full day as the presumptive nominee . “ I don ’ t know that I want to do that . ”
Third , Trump ’ s rise turned off the Republican groups that had bought the most television ads in the 2012 presidential race , including the political network of billionaires Charles and David Koch and the Crossroads groups affiliated with GOP strategist Karl Rove .

Bob Dole broke as he entered the general election . Dole lost that race and the Republican Party abandoned him in October in an effort to save GOP control of Congress .
But , unlike her husband in 1996 , Hillary Clinton first navigated a competitive primary without negative TV ads and has achieved a dramatic TV edge in the general election without the advantages of incumbency . Other than the limited spots from pro-Trump groups since May , Clinton was mentioned in advertisements during the GOP primary , when some super PACs and Republicans , such as Ted Cruz , used attacks on her to promote their own candidacies .

They 're approximately 20 percent accurate . While this list would have held water prior to the Supreme Court 's 2010 decision in Citizens United v. FEC , The Hill places undue value on social media .
`` Twitter , Snapchat and other social media tools are also playing a role in the race , '' the story argues for Zuckerberg 's influence , `` but they do not have the reach of Facebook . ''
If `` likes , posts , comments and shares '' were a valid metric , Bernie Sanders would be king of the world right now .
Citizens United invalidated any sort of grassroots political buzz ( e.g . Sanders ) . Even the master of media manipulation , Donald Trump , wo n't be able to translate his Twitter-momentum into a general election win against establishment collage Hillary Clinton , unless he can unite the GOP behind him .
The ability of nonprofits to accept unlimited individual donations to push a political agenda is far more important than whether or not the `` money-losing '' Huffington Post covers Trump under its `` entertainment '' or `` politics '' section .
So-called dark money , in conjunction with a wide-reaching `` mouthpiece , '' paves the road to the Oval Office -- and even a brilliant John Oliver expose ca n't change that .
Special interest groups -- like the NRA -- can scrounge up a good chunk of change for the candidate most likely to maintain the status quo , but Super PACs are the best source of dark money .
PACs have the added benefit of keeping their donors anonymous , which is a nice feature for people who do n't want their tennis partners to know they bet on the wrong horse or , worse yet , backed Trump .
As the face of the Koch Brothers — the infamous proprietors of libertarian-leaning Freedom Partners Action Fund -- Charles Koch deals with the client-facing aspects of Koch PR .
In an interview with ABC on Sunday , Charles Koch explained his and his brother David 's decision to withhold their much-coveted endorsement of the remaining candidates . In so doing , Charles condemned what he called a `` two-tiered system '' ( i.e . a regressive tax ) and suggested Hillary Clinton might make a better president than Cruz or Trump .

Over the weekend, The Hill published its list of ""Five Internet powerbrokers who could shape the election"": They selected Mark Zuckerberg, Matt Drudge, John Oliver, Arianna Huffington and Erin Hill.

They're approximately 20 percent accurate. While this list would have held water prior to the Supreme Court's 2010 decision in Citizens United v. FEC, The Hill places undue value on social media.

""Twitter, Snapchat and other social media tools are also playing a role in the race,"" the story argues for Zuckerberg's influence, ""but they do not have the reach of Facebook.""

If ""likes, posts, comments and shares"" were a valid metric, Bernie Sanders would be king of the world right now.

Citizens United invalidated any sort of grassroots political buzz (e.g. Sanders). Even the master of media manipulation, Donald Trump, won't be able to translate his Twitter-momentum into a general election win against establishment collage Hillary Clinton, unless he can unite the GOP behind him.

The ability of nonprofits to accept unlimited individual donations to push a political agenda is far more important than whether or not the ""money-losing"" Huffington Post covers Trump under its ""entertainment"" or ""politics"" section.

So-called dark money, in conjunction with a wide-reaching ""mouthpiece,"" paves the road to the Oval Office -- and even a brilliant John Oliver expose can't change that.

Special interest groups -- like the NRA -- can scrounge up a good chunk of change for the candidate most likely to maintain the status quo, but Super PACs are the best source of dark money.

PACs have the added benefit of keeping their donors anonymous, which is a nice feature for people who don't want their tennis partners to know they bet on the wrong horse or, worse yet, backed Trump.

Charles Koch:

As the face of the Koch Brothers — the infamous proprietors of libertarian-leaning Freedom Partners Action Fund -- Charles Koch deals with the client-facing aspects of Koch PR.

In an interview with ABC on Sunday, Charles Koch explained his and his brother David's decision to withhold their much-coveted endorsement of the remaining candidates. In so doing, Charles condemned what he called a ""two-tiered system"" (i.e. a regressive tax) and suggested Hillary Clinton might make a better president than Cruz or Trump.

Koch's Hillary support isn't necessarily as out-of-left-field as it may seem, considering the brothers' recent embrace of criminal justice reform.

There's a limit to how far PAC money can keep a candidate afloat (e.g. Jeb! Bush and Li'l Marco Rubio). For lack of a less conspiratorial word, every special interest needs a mouthpiece.

Not a known political financier, Amazon's Jeff Bezos took a less direct route to political influence in purchasing the Washington Post in 2013. And though WaPo is a humongous organization, editorial leanings in the media tend to have a top-down effect.

Despite his nearly $55 billion net worth, Bezos has donated relatively small amounts to Democrats ($28,000) and Republicans ($4,000). Some, however, claim he's similar to other tech entrepreneurs who support a libertarian, small-government platform.

Matt Drudge:

(Note: Drudge was on the Hill's list, too. He's undisputedly good at shaping the national political narrative.)

As the namesake of prominent news aggregation site, Drudge Report, Matt Drudge wields his right-wing influence through the careful curation of what appears on the site's homepage.

In their book, ""The Way to Win,"" Mark Halperin and John F. Harris call Drudge ""the single most influential purveyor of information about American politics"" for his role in John Kerry's loss in 2004.

The left works overtime to control everyone’s sense of reality. They have lost the hearts and minds of Americans so all they can do now is arrange various public Kabuki dramas insisting that America (and Americans by default) are no good and not worth standing for.

For a media that remain pathologically fixated on their hatred for the president, having to cover other news is anathema to them. Who knows, events they could cover might help President Trump; or if they stop attacking him for a few days people might have a moment to consider the president without him being slathered in media crazy sauce.

So, as Mr. Trump received praise for guiding the nation through hurricanes, which played a part in his approval ratings rise, it’s no surprise the left lurched forward and decided more racial division and complaining about America were necessary.

“Taking a knee” has become the new “Hands up, don’t shoot” scenario for liberal activists. As their hero Hillary Clinton wanders around the country continuing her “Tour J’accuse,” major league football players decided to kneel (again) during Sunday’s football games.

Despite the wall-to-wall coverage of the “protest,” the fact of the matter is, it wasn’t much of a protest at all. The Daily Caller reports only 12 percent of NFL players sat or kneeled during the anthem. That’s the story, but one you won’t hear from the legacy media.

A scramble to smear the president is all this is. They choose to cover the contrived NFL protest about inequality, but where are they covering another weekend of bloodshed in Chicago? Forty people were shot this past weekend in Chicago, with 12 fatalities.

Then there was a mass shooting at a Christian church in Antioch, Tennessee. The horror happened on Sunday. The media hasn’t really been interested in the murdered woman and seven seriously injured because they had their multimillionaire football players kneeling and complaining about Mr. Trump.

I have anchored the evening news for KMEX, Univision’s Spanish-language local station in Los Angeles, for the last eight years. The first thing that surprised me when I started was the station’s approach to community-oriented journalism. Before coming to Univision, I had a narrower interpretation of television coverage: I saw a journalist’s sole task as reporting the news, not offering guidance to help viewers navigate their daily lives. KMEX has taught me otherwise.

Over my first few months on the job at the city’s most popular network (in any language), I saw my assignment desk colleagues transform calls from our viewers into specific news stories. The plight of a family wrongly evicted became an investigative series. A complaint about pollution turned into a story that uncovered malfeasance by a recycling company. The news team’s commitment, I soon learned, extended into territory that might not be strictly considered journalism but rather a sort of companionship—a mission to offer guidance for a mostly immigrant audience, in need of help navigating their adoptive country. This role also extended beyond TV: We gave the community financial advice, organized education fairs, or promoted free health clinics.

This form of local news has been particularly relevant during the coronavirus pandemic. “Univision has always been a trusted source of news and information,” news director Marco Flores told me. “Our community calls the assignment desk before they call the police. This kind of loyalty is a privilege, but also a huge responsibility and one we don’t take lightly.” The current crisis brought this duty into pristine focus. Over the past couple of months, we have dedicated our newscasts almost exclusively to the very specific needs of a community that is undergoing a seismic upheaval.

After local and state officials in California first put quarantine rules into effect, we held a Facebook Live chat to address the community’s concerns and, hopefully, alleviate its fears. The number of questions overwhelmed us. Some left me heartbroken. Many viewers agonized over how they would make rent or what they would do if their landlord tried to evict them. Others wanted help understanding what exactly an “essential” job was or whether they would be getting any sort of relief from the government. Many explained a distressing choice: try to wait out the pandemic and risk losing everything they had patiently built since immigrating, or pack their belongings and return to their countries of origin, closing the door on their American dream.

For the majority of our audience—and the country’s immigrant community as a whole—these questions are not rhetorical. Though many work jobs deemed essential by the government itself, such as health care services and those involved in the nation’s food supply, undocumented workers are now deeply vulnerable, left out of any relief from Washington’s massive stimulus package. It is up to local news teams like the one I am part of to offer concrete and urgent answers.

It is an enormous responsibility, and one that comes as our own jobs have been utterly transformed.

Like most local operations across the country, KMEX’s team has had to reinvent the way it broadcasts the news. There are fewer people in the newsroom. What once was a lively morning editorial meeting, with the smell of coffee and the occasional Porto’s pastries, has now turned into a multiscreen Zoom discussion. In these times of social distancing, newsgathering has taken precedence over technical quality. Interviews that were once done in person are now conducted via Skype, Zoom, or FaceTime. While still important, the audiovisual crispness of these interactions is no longer an absolute priority.

We have gotten used to seeing colleagues and interviewees in less than stellar lighting or without crystal-clear sound. My co-anchor, Andrea González, spent the first couple of weeks working from home, transforming her living room into a small studio, using her cellphone as a camera and a streaming device through a magical app called LiveU. Other reporters have done so as well, me included. This is just a precaution; thankfully, none of us has fallen ill. But the news hasn’t stopped. On the contrary, it’s more urgent than ever, and that urgency has forced us to innovate.

We begin every day with the coldest of news items: the daily numbers, the evolution of the terrifying contagion curve. But our rhythm and editorial approach is now very different. Where before we would feature story after story documenting local events, we now feature extended question-and-answer sessions with epidemiologists, mental health professionals, or personal finance experts. We routinely call in to Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti’s press conference and ask him a question, in Spanish, from the studio.

We have also helped convey the importance of social distancing and basic hygiene measures. Veteran reporter Oswaldo Borraez, who usually covers the crime beat, is now focusing on news stories around quarantine awareness. “What we cover and how we cover things now might mean the difference between having access to food, medicine, or basic sustenance for our community,” Borraez told me. “It’s a unique moment, and what we do now will determine where things go tomorrow.”

Borraez brings this resolve to his daily work in the field. His story tags—that brief comment after the news story airs—have become a reliable and much-needed daily lesson on the new normal from a reliable source; like many of my colleagues, Borraez has been on our viewers’ screens for decades. When he reports, people listen. When he admonishes, people listen even more.

A couple of days ago, I ran into Pablo, a baker who works at our local convenience store. We were both wearing face masks. “I hardly recognized you,” he said, amused. We shared a laugh, and then Pablo told me he was grateful. He had tuned in to a discussion I had conducted about the need to take the coronavirus seriously. He told me he had liked my alien invasion example: In the first few days, in a last-ditch effort to convince the audience of the risk of contagion, I had noted that if the virus were a more visible enemy, aliens for instance, we wouldn’t question its veracity, however ludicrous the adversary seemed. “I also liked how you said that nurses and doctors are now like soldiers in a war,” he told me. “That helped my family understand.”

The exchange inspired me.

In the past few days, KMEX has begun airing a different kind of story. Amid the anguish, the station’s assignment desk has heard stories of survival and solidarity: a taquero taking his truck to a local hospital, a young Hispanic entrepreneur reinventing her company to manufacture face masks.

It will be, I hope, part of our future role. We have helped our audience through the storm. Much will need to be rebuilt. Now, we must help them find solace in the presence of others and, when the time comes, help them make sense of the world after the virus.

Shane Day , Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency ’ s National Center for Medical Intelligence ( NCMI ) , issued a statement on Wednesday countering ABC News ’ claim that his agency laid out coronavirus concerns in a November intelligence report .
The report , released by ABC News Wednesday morning , claimed : “ U.S . intelligence officials were warning that a contagion was sweeping through China ’ s Wuhan region , changing the patterns of life and business and posing a threat to the population , according to four sources briefed on the secret reporting . ”
“ Two officials familiar with the document ’ s contents ” reportedly told ABC that those concerns “ were detailed in a November intelligence report by the military ’ s National Center for Medical Intelligence ( NCMI ) . ”

Shane Day, Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency’s National Center for Medical Intelligence (NCMI), issued a statement on Wednesday countering ABC News’ claim that his agency laid out coronavirus concerns in a November intelligence report.

The report, released by ABC News Wednesday morning, claimed: “U.S. intelligence officials were warning that a contagion was sweeping through China’s Wuhan region, changing the patterns of life and business and posing a threat to the population, according to four sources briefed on the secret reporting.”

“Two officials familiar with the document’s contents” reportedly told ABC that those concerns “were detailed in a November intelligence report by the military’s National Center for Medical Intelligence (NCMI).”

From the ABC News story:

The report was the result of analysis of wire and computer intercepts, coupled with satellite images. It raised alarms because an out-of-control disease would pose a serious threat to U.S. forces in Asia — forces that depend on the NCMI’s work. And it paints a picture of an American government that could have ramped up mitigation and containment efforts far earlier to prepare for a crisis poised to come home. ‘Analysts concluded it could be a cataclysmic event,’ one of the sources said of the NCMI’s report. ‘It was then briefed multiple times to’ the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon’s Joint Staff and the White House.

The sources told the news outlet that a “detailed explanation of the problem” appeared in President Donald Trump’s “Daily Brief of intelligence matters in early January.”

“The timeline of the intel side of this may be further back than we’re discussing,” a source reportedly told ABC. “But this was definitely being briefed beginning at the end of November as something the military needed to take a posture on.” (RELATED: FLASHBACK Jan. 14: WHO Tells Everyone Don’t Worry Because China Says Coronavirus Isn’t Contagious)

Will it be climate change activist Greta Thunberg ? The Whistleblower ? Nancy Pelosi ? The choice is yours to make .
On Monday , the magazine unveiled its short list of finalists on NBC ’ s “ Today , ” which included more than a few of President Trump ’ s friends and foes — including Greta Thunberg , soccer star Megan Rapinoe , and the infamous whistleblower who helped prompt the ongoing House impeachment proceedings .
“ The teen activist has become a prominent face in the fight to save the environment in the face of climate change , ” the outlet said of Thunberg . “ The 16-year-old from Sweden was the catalyst in a host of student-led strikes involving more than a million students across the world in the last two years when she began spending her school days protesting outside the Swedish parliament . ”
When speaking of “ The Whistleblower , ” “ Today ” described the mysterious fellow as an “ anonymous CIA officer shook up the U.S. government by triggering the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump . ”
If the whistleblower were selected , it would be the second time since 2002 that the magazine selected whistleblowers for the top slot .
“ A group of whistleblowers were previously selected for the honor by TIME in 2002 for bringing to light the massive accounting scandals at Enron and Worldcom as well as the FBI ’ s mishandling of information from the 9/11 attacks , ” reported the outlet .
Also included on the list is none other than LGBT icon soccer player Megan Rapinoe , who became the most notoriously left-wing athlete since Colin Kaepernick after helping lead the U.S. to victory in the FIFA Women ’ s World Cup .
“ Rapinoe also sparred with President Donald Trump during the World Cup run after saying she would never visit the White House if the team won the tournament , ” the outlet said of Rapinoe . “ She also has been an outspoken advocate for LGBTQ rights since publicly coming out as gay in 2012 and has joined with her teammates on the U.S. women ’ s national team to fight to receive equal pay with the U.S. men ’ s national team . ”
Of those listed by TIME , the most unifying pick that all Americans would perhaps rally behind is the Hong Kong protesters :
Waves of demonstrations have swept across the special administrative region of China in response to proposed amendments to Hong Kong ’ s extradition law . The change would allow the Hong Kong government to extradite people to mainland China , where human rights groups have said citizens are often arbitrarily imprisoned for speaking out against the government . Critics of the bill have viewed it as the Chinese government in Beijing trying to exert more control over Hong Kong . The protests began in earnest in June , when more than a million people protested against the bill in front of Hong Kong ’ s legislature , with police firing rubber bullets and tear gas into the crowd . The bill has been indefinitely suspended , but pro-democracy protests have continued for months , including a transportation strike and demonstrators taking over the Hong Kong airport . They also have demanded that the nearly 5,000 protesters who have been arrested be released as well as universal suffrage for Hong Kong citizens .
Should TIME select the Hong Kong protesters , it would be a bold move and signify the magazine ’ s willingness to buck the current cultural trend of catering to the Chinese government .

Edgar Maddison Welch , 28 , told the New York Times in a Wednesday videoconference that the online articles he read about Comet Ping Pong pizzeria – which linked the supposed ring to Hillary Clinton – left him with the “ impression something nefarious was happening ” and he wanted to “ really able to look into it . ”
Court documents showed that Welch entered the eatery and fired an AR-15 rifle several times inside the restaurant but later exited with his hands up . He surrendered to police when he found no signs of children being held as sex slaves .
`` I just wanted to do some good and went about it the wrong way , '' he told the newspaper .
While Welch acknowledged that his “ intel ” on the restaurant was not 100 percent , he refused to dismiss that what he had read online was untrue , conceding only that there were no children `` inside that dwelling . ''
He also rejected the term “ fake news ” believing that it diminishes stories shared outside the mainstream media .
Welch told the newspaper he started driving to Washington from his Salisbury , N.C. , home intending only to give the restaurant a `` closer look . '' But while on the way , he said he felt his `` heart breaking over the thought of innocent people suffering . ''
Welch would not say why he brought an AR-15 into the pizza shop and fired it , the newspaper reported .
On Thursday , a judge delayed a preliminary hearing for Welch . His public defender requested the delay , saying she needed more time to investigate the case . He will be back in court Tuesday .
Welch appears to have lived an aimless life that became turbulent in the weeks before he was drawn to the nation 's capital by a fake news story .
Friends and family say he is a well-meaning father of two girls who wanted to be a firefighter . But he also unnerved some with his religious fervor and sometimes had trouble detaching himself from the internet .
In the weeks before his Washington arrest , there were other signs of turbulence . In late October , Welch struck a teenage pedestrian with his car in his hometown , requiring the boy to be airlifted to a hospital , according to a police report that said he was n't immediately charged . More recently , days before he drove to Washington , he was dropped from the rolls of a volunteer fire department .
In past years , he was convicted of drunken driving and minor drug charges .
But the one constant , friends and family say , was his love for his two young daughters .
`` He 's a father and a very loving man , very concerned about children , '' said his aunt Tajuana Tadlock , adding : `` He 's not a vigilante , by no check of the words . ''
Tadlock said Welch 's parents have n't been able to talk to him to ask what he was thinking , and the family 's only information comes from the news and the public defender .
In recent years , Welch often mentioned his Christian faith . Interspersed with Facebook posts about his daughters are the registered Republican 's musings on the Bible and religion .
Danielle Tillman of Raleigh said she met Welch a few months ago and has known his current girlfriend for years . She recalls Welch made her uncomfortable while talking at length about religion . At one point , he grabbed her hand and prayed , asking for `` the demons to come out of me , '' she said .
Welch 's family has roots in the Salisbury area , where his father and grandfather served in local government , according to the Salisbury Post . Friends say he attended West Rowan High School . A woman at the family 's property declined to answer questions this week .
Around age 18 , Welch pleaded guilty to misdemeanor drug possession charges in neighboring Cabarrus County , according to online records of the January 2007 offense .
Welch enrolled at Cape Fear Community College in Wilmington , but court records say he did n't graduate .
On a break from college in 2009 , Welch was interviewed by the Salisbury Post after he made it halfway through a hike of the 500-mile Colorado Trail . He told the newspaper the hike helped him overcome an addiction to the internet .
`` It 's a good feeling , going solo , '' he told the newspaper . `` There 's something spiritual about it . ''
In April 2013 , Welch was charged with impaired driving with a blood-alcohol content of .09 , court records show . He pleaded guilty , was sentenced to probation and community service and underwent alcohol counseling .
Rowan County records show that after a short marriage , his wife filed for divorce in November 2014 . The thin file does n't say why they split up . The divorce complaint was dismissed in 2015 after neither attended a scheduled hearing . Documents related to his arrest say they remain separated , and his two children live with him .
Welch twice served briefly as a volunteer firefighter , and his aunt said he was recently taking classes needed to get a paying job as a firefighter .
Locke Fire Chief Rusty Alexander said Welch barely showed up at the fire station after joining in 2012 , and lasted about six months .
`` He tried it , and basically it was n't for him , '' Alexander said .
In May 2016 , Welch became a volunteer firefighter in the town of Spencer , Chief Gray Grubb said . Grubb said Welch stopped attending training sessions and did n't answer alarms , so he was removed from the active roster Nov. 30 .

media_bias,Salon,0,http://www.salon.com/2014/02/19/sunday_shows_climate_disgrace_cluelessness_and_false_balance_could_cost_lives/,Sunday shows' climate disgrace: Cluelessness and false balance could cost lives,2014-02-19,,"Sunday shows ' climate disgrace : Cluelessness and false balance could cost lives From using the wrong words , to hosting the wrong people , to questioning science , these shows are doing real damage
Now that the East Coast and parts of the Southern U.S. have been battered over and over again with extreme weather this winter , and while California is in the midst of its worst and longest drought on historical record , the Sunday `` news '' shows , all at once , decided this week to cover what they describe as `` climate change '' -- or , in the words of NBC 's `` Meet the Press '' host , David Gregory , `` The Politics of Weather . ''
All four of the major Sunday `` news '' shows -- - NBC 's `` Meet the Press , '' ABC 's `` This Week , '' CBS ' `` Face the Nation '' and Fox 's `` Fox 'News ' Sunday '' -- - covered the matter in various ( lousy ) ways .
Out of all four of them , just `` This Week '' and `` Face the Nation '' bothered to book an actual climate scientist to take part in the conversation with their various bevies of political and journalistic deniers and non-scientists . Only `` Face the Nation '' offered a one-on-one with a climate scientist before then bringing on the denier .
Gregory , whom Esquire 's Charlie Pierce aptly described as a `` noodlebrained bag of useless flesh , '' tipped his hand last Friday by announcing excitedly via Twitter that `` MTP '' would be `` debating climate change '' on this week 's show with Rep. Marsha Blackburn , R-Tenn. , one of Congress ' top carbon industry proponents and global warming deniers and Bill Nye `` The Science Guy , '' a mechanical engineer turned TV science personality . No actual climate scientists necessary , apparently , to `` debate '' climate change in `` Meet the Press '' World .
Pierce called the embarrassing exchange `` every bit as grim as you can imagine , '' and it certainly was . Here 's just part of his scathing , dead-on-the-money response to it ...
Yesterday , and I am not exaggerating a bit here , David Gregory and the Meet The Press gang presented the definitive argument not only for their mutual expulsion from the company of sentient primates , but also the single best example of why the entire elite political class of this country is one day going to be subject to a massive class-action negligence suit on the part of whatever rodents are left . Let us stipulate from the outset -- among the people who actually know what they 're talking about , there is no debate about climate change . None . It is occurring . Humans are exacerbating it at an unacceptable rate and , if something is n't done , beachfront property in Indianapolis one day is going to be at a premium . Neither political party has shown itself overly willing to confront this reality , but only one of them mocks the science and slanders the scientists .
Pierce responds to Blackburn 's idiotic word salad about `` hypotheses or theories or unproven sciences , '' to say : `` Hypothesis . Theories . Unproven sciences . While England drowns and Australia burns and California dies of thirst . ''
We 've discussed the record rains and flooding in Great Britain several times of late on our Green News Report and on a television appearance last week on RT America , but we have n't written about it much here . Last week , in response to the unrelenting extreme weather and storm surges swamping much of Southern England , Great Britain 's conservative Prime Minister David Cameron was forced to promise : `` The Government will do everything it can to coordinate the nation 's resources . If money needs to be spent , it will be spent . If resources are required , we will provide them . If the military can help , they will be there . ''
The very next day , Cameron promised as he announced the deployment of the U.K. military to build a 60-meter-high sea wall in one area of the country : `` Money is no object in this relief effort . Whatever money is needed for it , will be spent . ''
He went on to explain that in yet another area , Somerset , `` There have been more than 65 million cubic meters of flood water . There is now around 3 million tons of water being pumped out every day . The equivalent of three Wembley Stadiums . ''
If you 're wondering what all those `` scientists '' and their crazy talk of `` sea rise '' are about , here are just a few seconds of video from over the weekend in Newlyn , Cornwall ( video that the U.S. news networks apparently have n't bothered to show you ) ...
Yes , even actual conservatives now , such as Cameron , have come to appreciate the dangers of global warming , even if it is only after disaster has struck his constituents , only after they are forced to deal with its costly consequences . And those consequences are becoming more and more costly by the year . Globally , in 2013 , according to a recent report by reinsurance group Aon Benfield , we had the most extreme weather events in history that caused damage of $ 1 billion or more each , with 41 such events . `` That 's one more than the previous set in 2010 , '' notes Climate Central 's Brian Kahn , detailing the steady and costly increase in such catastrophes over recent decades .
In the bargain , actual conservatives in this country may also like to not notice that failure to prepare for extreme weather events hastened by global warming has cost the U.S. some $ 1.15 trillion over the past 30 years , according to the Department of Homeland Security 's secretary for policy last week . He added , during his congressional testimony , that it 's expected to cost at least another trillion over the coming decades .
But why bother doing anything about it ? Denial is much easier , if much more costly .
On Sunday , NBC and Fox `` News '' and the others were giving airtime to jackasses like Wall Street Journal 's Kimberly Strassel to explain the reason scientists use the term `` climate change '' now instead of `` global warming . '' ( In fact , they do n't . Both terms have long been used , with climate change used even earlier than global warming , though Republican and Fox `` News '' contributor Frank Luntz famously wrote a memo urging the GOP to use `` climate change '' instead of `` global warming , '' because he thought it was less frightening . ) Strassel 's answer to Chris Wallace 's straw man question about why it 's `` climate change '' now instead of `` global warming '' : Because `` you could n't prove that there was much global warming anymore , you know . ''
Really ? Tell that to the people of Australia , where they were recently forced to add a new color to their weather maps to denote newly extreme heat ; where there were 203 heat-related deaths in Victoria alone last month ; and where the frequency of such heat waves has now `` surpasse [ d ] levels previously predicted for 2030 . ''
`` Heat waves are coming earlier , they are lasting longer and they are hotter , '' Tim Flannery of the Australian Climate Council told the Guardian yesterday in conjunction with the group 's new report on Australia 's unprecedented heat waves . `` They build up for days and before you know it , elderly people , infants and the homeless are in danger . ''
Nonetheless , the right-wing Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott still remains in denial there , last week claiming that `` there have always been tough times and lush times , '' as he refused to link the nation 's record heat and wildfires and drought to climate change . Not enough dead people there yet , apparently .
`` We 're not looking at these things in a linked-up way , '' Flannery told the Guardian in response to Abbott 's denial . `` We do n't seem to recognise the relationship between the number and intensity of heatwaves on bushfires , and the impact on droughts ... and people do n't want to face the truth .
`` Governments have a responsibility to keep Australians safe from dangers such as climate change . You need to be explicit about that threat . We have yet to see that policy yet , '' he said .
In this country , of course , we have n't seen it either . Here , even the non-wingnut journalists have now been cowed into not linking the human use of fossil fuels to global warming .
Despite the fact that 97 percent of the 4,000 scientific studies on the cause of global warming over the past 20 years have found that human activity is to blame for warmer global temperatures , non-wingnuts like NBC weatherman Al Roker offer viewers nonsense such as : `` Is it a natural cycle ? Is it due to human interference or human conditions that we have created ? That remains open to debate . But there is no doubt the climate is changing . ''
No , humanity 's contribution to climate change does not remain open to debate , at least if you bother to listen to the vast consensus of the world 's climate scientists for the past several decades . But what do they know ? And why should anybody want to include them on a network news show 's `` debate '' about climate change ?
`` What Roker 's doing here is what you might call skepticism-once-removed , '' the Wire 's Philip Bump explains in his fact-check of Sunday 's `` MTP '' `` debate . '' `` He 's too smart and too prominent to deny that climate change exists , but he also does n't want to get nasty emails from people who hate the idea that anyone would say climate change exists ... Roker is wrong . ''
But rather than climate scientists , better to offer views of TV-friendly weathermen like Roker and mechanical scientists like Nye and offer viewers the sage wisdom of Republican denialists like Blackburn and North Carolina 's Gov . Pat McCrory ( the 28-year former executive of Duke Energy ) who appeared on two different Sunday shows this week ( neither of which bothered to ask him about North Carolina 's recent massive coal ash spill by Duke Energy ) and `` balance '' that with folks like Fox 's version of a `` liberal , '' Kirsten Powers and NBC 's Chuck Todd .
Powers explained on Sunday that while global warming `` has become very much an article of faith on the left '' ( no , Kirsten , science is not `` faith '' ) , it 's probably best to not talk about it all very much . We should just call for `` reducing carbon emissions '' because , `` whether you believe in climate change or not , I think [ that ] is something that people should be able to get behind . ''
`` I mean , less pollution is definitely a good thing , '' declared Powers , so as not to explain the truth too much to sensitive fossil fuel propagandized viewers . `` So that might be a better way to make the argument rather than claiming that climate change is the cause of every single thing that happens with the weather . ''
Naturally , over on NBC , Todd agreed with the general let's-not-upset-everybody notion . He suggested on the `` Meet the Press '' roundtable on Sunday that maybe it 's better to keep the actual causes of this whole human-caused global warming thing to ourselves .
`` I wonder if there 's too much -- you know , I know some environmentalists are frustrated with that portion of the debate -- but maybe you steer away from it and say , it does n't matter , '' Todd advised . Who cares why it 's happening ? ! Better to just discuss what we 'll need to do now to mitigate it . He 'd like to `` table that part of the debate '' regarding how we might make it all less horrific .
`` We have to tackle this infrastructure problem . You got to build different higher seawalls in some places . We 're going to have to figure out a different way to distribute water in California ... and the federal government is going to have to pay for this ... pay for all these things . And so I wonder if everybody should say , you know what ? Let 's table this debate . We know what 's happening . Table that part of the debate because when you do that , then it becomes this like clubbing each other with -- with -- with political argument that takes away from what we have to do . ''
`` How , precisely , would this policy approach work ? '' Pierce asked rhetorically . `` 'We will spend a few billion to build state-of-the-art seawalls but we wo n't bother giving a reason for why we 're doing it . We 're going to rearrange radically the way 38 million people get their water and we 'll be apolitically vague when people ask why they woke up one morning with a fking aqueduct in their backyard . ' ''

''","Sunday shows' climate disgrace: Cluelessness and false balance could cost lives From using the wrong words, to hosting the wrong people, to questioning science, these shows are doing real damage

Now that the East Coast and parts of the Southern U.S. have been battered over and over again with extreme weather this winter, and while California is in the midst of its worst and longest drought on historical record, the Sunday ""news"" shows, all at once, decided this week to cover what they describe as ""climate change"" -- or, in the words of NBC's ""Meet the Press"" host, David Gregory, ""The Politics of Weather.""

All four of the major Sunday ""news"" shows --- NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" ABC's ""This Week,"" CBS' ""Face the Nation"" and Fox's ""Fox 'News' Sunday"" --- covered the matter in various (lousy) ways.

Out of all four of them, just ""This Week"" and ""Face the Nation"" bothered to book an actual climate scientist to take part in the conversation with their various bevies of political and journalistic deniers and non-scientists. Only ""Face the Nation"" offered a one-on-one with a climate scientist before then bringing on the denier.

Gregory, whom Esquire's Charlie Pierce aptly described as a ""noodlebrained bag of useless flesh,"" tipped his hand last Friday by announcing excitedly via Twitter that ""MTP"" would be ""debating climate change"" on this week's show with Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., one of Congress' top carbon industry proponents and global warming deniers and Bill Nye ""The Science Guy,"" a mechanical engineer turned TV science personality. No actual climate scientists necessary, apparently, to ""debate"" climate change in ""Meet the Press"" World.

Pierce called the embarrassing exchange ""every bit as grim as you can imagine,"" and it certainly was. Here's just part of his scathing, dead-on-the-money response to it ...

Yesterday, and I am not exaggerating a bit here, David Gregory and the Meet The Press gang presented the definitive argument not only for their mutual expulsion from the company of sentient primates, but also the single best example of why the entire elite political class of this country is one day going to be subject to a massive class-action negligence suit on the part of whatever rodents are left. Let us stipulate from the outset -- among the people who actually know what they're talking about, there is no debate about climate change. None. It is occurring. Humans are exacerbating it at an unacceptable rate and, if something isn't done, beachfront property in Indianapolis one day is going to be at a premium. Neither political party has shown itself overly willing to confront this reality, but only one of them mocks the science and slanders the scientists.

Pierce responds to Blackburn's idiotic word salad about ""hypotheses or theories or unproven sciences,"" to say: ""Hypothesis. Theories. Unproven sciences. While England drowns and Australia burns and California dies of thirst.""

We've discussed the record rains and flooding in Great Britain several times of late on our Green News Report and on a television appearance last week on RT America, but we haven't written about it much here. Last week, in response to the unrelenting extreme weather and storm surges swamping much of Southern England, Great Britain's conservative Prime Minister David Cameron was forced to promise: ""The Government will do everything it can to coordinate the nation's resources. If money needs to be spent, it will be spent. If resources are required, we will provide them. If the military can help, they will be there.""

The very next day, Cameron promised as he announced the deployment of the U.K. military to build a 60-meter-high sea wall in one area of the country: ""Money is no object in this relief effort. Whatever money is needed for it, will be spent.""

He went on to explain that in yet another area, Somerset, ""There have been more than 65 million cubic meters of flood water. There is now around 3 million tons of water being pumped out every day. The equivalent of three Wembley Stadiums.""

If you're wondering what all those ""scientists"" and their crazy talk of ""sea rise"" are about, here are just a few seconds of video from over the weekend in Newlyn, Cornwall (video that the U.S. news networks apparently haven't bothered to show you) ...

Yes, even actual conservatives now, such as Cameron, have come to appreciate the dangers of global warming, even if it is only after disaster has struck his constituents, only after they are forced to deal with its costly consequences. And those consequences are becoming more and more costly by the year. Globally, in 2013, according to a recent report by reinsurance group Aon Benfield, we had the most extreme weather events in history that caused damage of $1 billion or more each, with 41 such events. ""That's one more than the previous set in 2010,"" notes Climate Central's Brian Kahn, detailing the steady and costly increase in such catastrophes over recent decades.

In the bargain, actual conservatives in this country may also like to not notice that failure to prepare for extreme weather events hastened by global warming has cost the U.S. some $1.15 trillion over the past 30 years, according to the Department of Homeland Security's secretary for policy last week. He added, during his congressional testimony, that it's expected to cost at least another trillion over the coming decades.

But why bother doing anything about it? Denial is much easier, if much more costly.

On Sunday, NBC and Fox ""News"" and the others were giving airtime to jackasses like Wall Street Journal's Kimberly Strassel to explain the reason scientists use the term ""climate change"" now instead of ""global warming."" (In fact, they don't. Both terms have long been used, with climate change used even earlier than global warming, though Republican and Fox ""News"" contributor Frank Luntz famously wrote a memo urging the GOP to use ""climate change"" instead of ""global warming,"" because he thought it was less frightening.) Strassel's answer to Chris Wallace's straw man question about why it's ""climate change"" now instead of ""global warming"": Because ""you couldn't prove that there was much global warming anymore, you know.""

Really? Tell that to the people of Australia, where they were recently forced to add a new color to their weather maps to denote newly extreme heat; where there were 203 heat-related deaths in Victoria alone last month; and where the frequency of such heat waves has now ""surpasse[d] levels previously predicted for 2030.""

""Heat waves are coming earlier, they are lasting longer and they are hotter,"" Tim Flannery of the Australian Climate Council told the Guardian yesterday in conjunction with the group's new report on Australia's unprecedented heat waves. ""They build up for days and before you know it, elderly people, infants and the homeless are in danger.""

Nonetheless, the right-wing Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott still remains in denial there, last week claiming that ""there have always been tough times and lush times,"" as he refused to link the nation's record heat and wildfires and drought to climate change. Not enough dead people there yet, apparently.

Advertisement:

""We're not looking at these things in a linked-up way,"" Flannery told the Guardian in response to Abbott's denial. ""We don't seem to recognise the relationship between the number and intensity of heatwaves on bushfires, and the impact on droughts ... and people don't want to face the truth.

""Governments have a responsibility to keep Australians safe from dangers such as climate change. You need to be explicit about that threat. We have yet to see that policy yet,"" he said.

In this country, of course, we haven't seen it either. Here, even the non-wingnut journalists have now been cowed into not linking the human use of fossil fuels to global warming.

Despite the fact that 97 percent of the 4,000 scientific studies on the cause of global warming over the past 20 years have found that human activity is to blame for warmer global temperatures, non-wingnuts like NBC weatherman Al Roker offer viewers nonsense such as: ""Is it a natural cycle? Is it due to human interference or human conditions that we have created? That remains open to debate. But there is no doubt the climate is changing.""

Advertisement:

No, humanity's contribution to climate change does not remain open to debate, at least if you bother to listen to the vast consensus of the world's climate scientists for the past several decades. But what do they know? And why should anybody want to include them on a network news show's ""debate"" about climate change?

""What Roker's doing here is what you might call skepticism-once-removed,"" the Wire's Philip Bump explains in his fact-check of Sunday's ""MTP"" ""debate."" ""He's too smart and too prominent to deny that climate change exists, but he also doesn't want to get nasty emails from people who hate the idea that anyone would say climate change exists ... Roker is wrong.""

But rather than climate scientists, better to offer views of TV-friendly weathermen like Roker and mechanical scientists like Nye and offer viewers the sage wisdom of Republican denialists like Blackburn and North Carolina's Gov. Pat McCrory (the 28-year former executive of Duke Energy) who appeared on two different Sunday shows this week (neither of which bothered to ask him about North Carolina's recent massive coal ash spill by Duke Energy) and ""balance"" that with folks like Fox's version of a ""liberal,"" Kirsten Powers and NBC's Chuck Todd.

Powers explained on Sunday that while global warming ""has become very much an article of faith on the left"" (no, Kirsten, science is not ""faith""), it's probably best to not talk about it all very much. We should just call for ""reducing carbon emissions"" because, ""whether you believe in climate change or not, I think [that] is something that people should be able to get behind.""

Advertisement:

""I mean, less pollution is definitely a good thing,"" declared Powers, so as not to explain the truth too much to sensitive fossil fuel propagandized viewers. ""So that might be a better way to make the argument rather than claiming that climate change is the cause of every single thing that happens with the weather.""

Naturally, over on NBC, Todd agreed with the general let's-not-upset-everybody notion. He suggested on the ""Meet the Press"" roundtable on Sunday that maybe it's better to keep the actual causes of this whole human-caused global warming thing to ourselves.

""I wonder if there's too much -- you know, I know some environmentalists are frustrated with that portion of the debate -- but maybe you steer away from it and say, it doesn't matter,"" Todd advised. Who cares why it's happening?! Better to just discuss what we'll need to do now to mitigate it. He'd like to ""table that part of the debate"" regarding how we might make it all less horrific.

""We have to tackle this infrastructure problem. You got to build different higher seawalls in some places. We're going to have to figure out a different way to distribute water in California ... and the federal government is going to have to pay for this ... pay for all these things. And so I wonder if everybody should say, you know what? Let's table this debate. We know what's happening. Table that part of the debate because when you do that, then it becomes this like clubbing each other with -- with -- with political argument that takes away from what we have to do.""

Advertisement:

Esquire's Pierce found Todd's suggestion particularly absurd.

""How, precisely, would this policy approach work?"" Pierce asked rhetorically. ""'We will spend a few billion to build state-of-the-art seawalls but we won't bother giving a reason for why we're doing it. We're going to rearrange radically the way 38 million people get their water and we'll be apolitically vague when people ask why they woke up one morning with a fking aqueduct in their backyard.'""

Apparently, the important thing is that the Sunday ""news"" shows either don't mention climate change at all, or if they do, have deniers and non-climate scientists talk about it, and when they finally do talk about it, maybe it's better to just not mention the reason for it at all. That way nobody -- especially the fossil fuel industry, which is a huge sponsor of all the network news outlets and most of our elected officials in Congress -- will have to discuss reality and scare those sensitive viewers and voters with actual information.

media_bias,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/2018/4/13/17194396/james-comey-book-higher-loyalty-hero,Why James Comey isn’t the hero you think he is,2018-04-13,"Alex Ward, Hannah Brown, Jen Kirby, Peter Kafka, Matthew Yglesias, Sean Collins, German Lopez","Back in October 2016 , Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D-CA ) called then-FBI Director James Comey ’ s decision to look into new Hillary Clinton emails just days before the election “ appalling. ” Her comment reflected the general sentiment among Democrats at the time .
But in May 2017 , President Donald Trump fired Comey because the FBI wouldn ’ t end an investigation into a former top Trump aide ’ s Russia ties . Democrats , almost in unison , openly warned that dismissing Comey meant Trump may have tried to obstruct justice . And after reports surfaced that Trump had called Comey a “ nut job , ” Feinstein herself defended the former FBI director , saying that “ Comey is no way , shape , or form a nut job . ”
As Comey now sits down for high-profile interview after high-profile interview — like he did on ABC on April 15 — to promote his new book , expect the good feelings from Democrats and the media alike to keep coming .
Comey ’ s new memoir , A Higher Loyalty , is due to come out on Tuesday . In it , highly critical of Trump , and the tome will assuredly inspire more Comey fandom on television , radio , and print . It may lead to even more arguments , like Damon Linker ’ s in the Week last June , “ that the former FBI director is a bona fide American hero . ”
But painting Comey that way misses a lot . He led the FBI when the bureau possibly mishandled its investigation into Clinton ’ s use of a private email server when she was secretary of state , perhaps costing Hillary Clinton the election . He was also the FBI director when he oversaw increased surveillance of Muslim communities and a culture of suspicion against Muslims and used suspect methods to stop terrorists .
Put together , as the Washington Post ’ s Margaret Sullivan noted on March 31 , Comey is undeserving of the veneration and softball questions he will surely field in the coming days in response to his much-hyped new book . That , in part , is because he did a successful job at cultivating his holier-than-thou persona , says Matthew Miller , a top Justice Department spokesperson in the Obama administration .
“ He wanted to position himself as the hero , ” Miller told me , “ the man of integrity who was going to tell the American people how it is — the last virgin in town . ”
The problem , though , is that the media fell for it .
At around 11 am on July 5 , 2016 , then-FBI Director Comey gave a surprise televised address — thrusting him into the national spotlight .
“ This will be an unusual statement in at least a couple ways , ” he admitted from the FBI ’ s lectern . “ I am going to include more detail about our process than I ordinarily would , because I think the American people deserve those details in a case of intense public interest . ”
The “ case ” in question was the FBI ’ s probe into Clinton ’ s use of a personal email server to conduct State Department business . Investigators wanted to know if Clinton had handled classified information on an insecure network , which could make it easier for foreign adversaries to steal top secrets .
But Comey recommended no criminal charges to the Justice Department , instead reprimanding her as “ extremely careless ” after finding 110 emails containing classified information among the 30,000 reviewed messages .
The following day , then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch accepted Comey ’ s choice not to charge Clinton . ( Lynch had just days before that decision met with Bill Clinton on an Arizona tarmac , leading to calls for her recusal from the case . ) Comey , in effect , closed the case .
According to an April 2017 New York Times report about Comey ’ s actions during the election , he chose this approach for a few reasons . First , to let those people within the FBI who were upset with Clinton ’ s conduct know that Comey heard and understood their concerns . But second , and most importantly , he aimed to shield the bureau from GOP-led attacks that the FBI took it easy on Clinton .
Those attacks came anyway . “ This announcement defies explanation . No one should be above the law , ” House Speaker Paul Ryan tweeted after Comey ’ s remarks . “ It appears damage is being done to the rule of law . ”
But the more controversial moment came three months later . As part of a probe into former Rep. Anthony Weiner ’ s ( D-NY ) sexually explicit conversations with a minor , the FBI found some of Clinton ’ s emails on his laptop . That was no coincidence : Huma Abedin , Weiner ’ s wife and a close Clinton aide at the State Department , backed up thousands of emails on her husband ’ s computer . Some agents believed Clinton had hid emails from them , adding to suspicions that the messages on Weiner ’ s laptop might just be the missing emails .
And then on October 28 , Comey informed Congress of what happened in a letter : “ In connection with an unrelated case , the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation . ”
It was the “ October surprise ” many feared — the reopening of an investigation into Clinton just 11 days before the election . According to polling expert Nate Silver , Comey changed the vote ’ s outcome by making the probe ’ s restart public :
Clinton ’ s standing in the polls fell sharply . She ’ d led Trump by 5.9 percentage points in FiveThirtyEight ’ s popular vote projection at 12:01 a.m. on Oct. 28 . A week later — after polls had time to fully reflect the letter — her lead had declined to 2.9 percentage points . That is to say , there was a shift of about 3 percentage points against Clinton . ... In the average swing state , Clinton ’ s lead declined from 4.5 percentage points at the start of Oct. 28 to just 1.7 percentage points on Nov. 4 . If the polls were off even slightly , Trump could be headed to the White House .
Silver ’ s chart dramatically shows the effect the letter seemed to have on the election .
To be clear , the problem here is not that Comey ’ s actions helped Trump beat Clinton . It ’ s that his actions likely had an impact on the election . The FBI is chiefly an apolitical institution , carrying out investigations regardless of the political moment . So for Comey to act the way he did — especially at the time that he did — made it seem like he overstepped his mandate .
“ The way he handled the Clinton investigation was seriously flawed and arguably a firing offense , ” Miller , the former top DOJ spokesperson , told me .
Comey wrestles with his decision in the new book . “ It is entirely possible that , because I was making decisions in an environment where Hillary Clinton was sure to be the next president , my concern about making her an illegitimate president by concealing the restarted investigation bore greater weight than it would have if the election appeared closer or if Donald Trump were ahead in all polls , ” he writes . “ But I don ’ t know . ”
Let ’ s be clear about what he ’ s saying : Comey admits Clinton ’ s lead in late October may have influenced his decision to reopen the probe and let the public know about it . That means he possibly allowed politics to dictate his actions — which looks really bad for the FBI director .
But Miller thinks Comey ’ s view of himself also played a part . “ He ’ s a man of integrity , but he very much believes he ’ s a man of integrity and often thinks he ’ s the only honest man in the room , ” he told me . “ At some point , that self-confidence crosses a line into self-righteousness . ”
Comey ’ s imprint on the election results is bad enough . The Justice Department ’ s inspector general will look into , and soon adjudicate on , how the FBI handled the Clinton probe . But you also just need to look at Comey ’ s time running the FBI to know he ’ s not Mr . Perfect .
Comey led the FBI for four years — and has faced a fair amount of criticism for his time there .
For one , Muslims working at the FBI felt their fellow agents put them under a microscope . Most notably , these employees felt the FBI would overly scrutinize them because of their heritage .
Former FBI employee Said “ Sam ” Barodi , according to the Guardian , detailed how some white FBI officials were openly Islamophobic , said Islam was to blame for acts of terrorism , and that some colleagues didn ’ t abide by the Constitution .
“ I would not advise anyone to work for the FBI under these circumstances . Fuck , stay away . It is not worth it . It is cancer , ” Barodi told the Guardian . “ Muslim employees in federal law enforcement , ” he continued , “ are the target . ”
But that ’ s not all . Comey also expanded the use of sting operations to catch would-be terrorists before they struck , and some of the practices were suspect . Last May , the Intercept reported that agents “ busted ” a mentally ill homeless man for claiming he had connections to ISIS . In a similar case , an informant also gave a homeless man $ 40 so he could buy the weapons — machetes , knives — he said he needed to carry out the attack .
Meanwhile , those stings didn ’ t stop actual terrorists . As the Intercept notes , the FBI looked at least twice at the man who eventually killed nearly 50 people and wounded another 50 at an Orlando nightclub in June 2016 . The FBI , apparently , didn ’ t consider the man a threat during its investigations .
And when the FBI charged the creator of the child porn dark website Playpen last year , the bureau didn ’ t shut down the service . That reversed the practice Robert Mueller — Comey ’ s predecessor and now the special counsel looking into possible Trump-Russia ties — started . Still , the FBI made hundreds of arrests in the US and around the world throughout the case , while also identifying or rescuing nearly 300 sexually abused children .
In short , Comey wasn ’ t exactly an exemplary leader when he was in charge of the FBI . Yet the “ Comey is a hero ” myth persists — though perhaps that says more about us than him .
Why we see Comey as a hero — but shouldn ’ t
The impulse to lionize Comey comes from the fact that he stood up to Trump .
When Trump demanded Comey pledge his loyalty to him , the FBI director declined . After Trump fired Comey last May , Comey revealed that he kept contemporaneous notes about his interactions with the president and made parts of them public . He also testified under oath during a high-profile Senate hearing last June , in which he shockingly called the president a liar .
Put together , this makes Comey stands out as a seemingly noble figure in the middle of the whole Trump-Russia mess , where Mueller ’ s probe has already found that high-level Trump campaign officials committed crimes .
But if you take a second look , that ’ s a pretty low bar . Comey may seem like the closest thing this drama has to a hero — except for maybe Mueller himself — but that doesn ’ t mean the media should forget his complicated past , and treat him like one .","Back in October 2016, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) called then-FBI Director James Comey’s decision to look into new Hillary Clinton emails just days before the election “appalling.” Her comment reflected the general sentiment among Democrats at the time.

Comey wasn’t a stellar FBI director

Why we see Comey as a hero — but shouldn’t

The impulse to lionize Comey comes from the fact that he stood up to Trump.

When Trump demanded Comey pledge his loyalty to him, the FBI director declined. After Trump fired Comey last May, Comey revealed that he kept contemporaneous notes about his interactions with the president and made parts of them public. He also testified under oath during a high-profile Senate hearing last June, in which he shockingly called the president a liar.

Put together, this makes Comey stands out as a seemingly noble figure in the middle of the whole Trump-Russia mess, where Mueller’s probe has already found that high-level Trump campaign officials committed crimes.

But if you take a second look, that’s a pretty low bar. Comey may seem like the closest thing this drama has to a hero — except for maybe Mueller himself — but that doesn’t mean the media should forget his complicated past, and treat him like one.",www.vox.com,left,LNYpRp5Sd3YLhWlC

That won't be easy.,2016-12-16,"Timothy B. Lee, Zack Beauchamp, Hannah Brown, Jen Kirby, Peter Kafka, Matthew Yglesias, Sean Collins","In the wake of the 2016 election , Facebook had a problem . A lot of people thought the site had done too little to combat fake news . At the same time , Facebook was desperate to maintain its reputation as a politically innocuous technology company . If it started directly declaring certain news stories fake , it would inevitably be drawn into emotionally charged political fights , damaging its credibility with partisans in the process .
So instead of trying to identify fake news itself , Facebook is outsourcing the work to third parties . Initially , five fact-checking organizations — Snopes , PolitiFact , Factcheck.org , ABC News , and the Associated Press — will be asked to review questionable articles and render a verdict about their veracity . If an article is rated false by these organizations , it will be marked as “ disputed ” and be pushed lower in a user ’ s newsfeed .
That puts some distance between Facebook and the politically charged question of what counts as fake news . But it ’ s not clear if this will be sufficient to mollify critics — predominantly on the right — who object to the very concept of trying to weed fake news out of the newsfeed .
At the same time , Facebook is giving fact-checking organizations a kind of power they ’ ve never had before : the power to publicly brand other websites ’ stories as “ disputed ” and push them down in Facebook users ’ newsfeeds . Facebook ’ s new fact-checking system is going to subject these organizations — some of them quite small — to an unprecedented amount of public scrutiny .
The problem is that — especially in the middle of a political campaign — what ’ s a “ fact ” is often hotly disputed .
“ PolitiFact consistently calls Republicans liars at two or three times the rate of Democrats , ” wrote Mark Hemingway in the conservative Weekly Standard in 2013 . “ Its individual judgments are regularly erroneous in ways that make it hard not to suspect the organization has a serious problem with political bias. ” In a Friday piece reacting to Facebook ’ s announcement , Hemingway wrote that PolitiFact “ might well be the most biased news organization in America . ”
Of course , fact-checking organizations deny that they ’ re biased . “ Our challenge to folks who say PolitiFact is biased is : ‘ Give me examples , ’ ” says Aaron Sharockman of PolitiFact , a fact-checking group associated with the Tampa Bay Times . “ Often we get a lot of silence back . ”
But PolitiFact ’ s conservative critics say they ’ re happy to supply examples of apparent bias . In a recent critique of fact-checking websites at Current Affairs , Nathan Robinson pointed out a case where PolitiFact had rated as “ mostly false ” Donald Trump ’ s claim that “ windmills are killing hundreds and hundreds of eagles. ” PolitiFact interpreted this as a claim that windmills are killing hundreds of eagles per year , which is probably false .
But as Robinson points out , Trump didn ’ t say “ per year , ” and over multiple years windmills almost certainly have killed hundreds of eagles . And PolitiFact ’ s nitpicking of Trump ’ s statements contrasts with the more generous attitude it sometimes takes toward the statements of other politicians .
For example , PolitiFact rated as “ mostly false ” Donald Trump ’ s claim that the real unemployment rate among black people ages 18 to 24 was 59 percent . Trump was likely referring to the fact that the employment-to-population ratio for black youths was 41 percent , leaving 59 percent outside the workforce . But that ’ s a different figure from the unemployment rate .
Yet when Bernie Sanders made a very similar mistake a year earlier , claiming that the “ real unemployment rate ” among teens ages 17 to 20 was 51 percent , PolitiFact rated this “ mostly true. ” True , Sanders was using the wrong terminology , it said , but the larger point Sanders was making was basically true : Young black people were having more trouble finding work than young white people . This , of course , was also the point Trump tried to make a year later , but PolitiFact was not in such a forgiving mood when he made this particular gaffe .
“ Critics point to one or two or three or even 10 statements over a nine-year span , ” Sharockman says , but he points out that his organization has conducted more than 13,000 fact-checks in its history . He argues that the isolated examples conservatives like to cite don ’ t reflect the organization ’ s larger body of work .
Sharockman also says that PolitiFact ’ s critics are not limited to the right . Liberal cable TV host Rachel Maddow has devoted several segments to blasting the organization for what she views as mistakes . For example , PolitiFact initially rated Marco Rubio ’ s claim that most Americans are conservative “ mostly true , ” even though most polls show that a mere plurality — but not a majority — of voters describe themselves that way . Maddow thinks the claim should have been rated false — PolitiFact eventually modified its rating to “ half true . ”
“ People on the edges of a particular ideology — I think this applies in both directions — they see the world in much starker terms than PolitiFact does , ” Sharockman says . “ For a lot of really partisan conservatives , and for progressive liberals , they see things as true and false and do n't believe there are shades of gray in between . ”
Of the fact-checking groups selected by Facebook , PolitiFact is the one that has drawn the most ire from conservatives . This may be because its mission of vetting the statements of candidates for office regularly puts it in the middle of partisan political disputes . Factcheck.org has a mission similar to PolitiFact ’ s but has not drawn as much conservative criticism .
Another Facebook-selected group , Snopes , is more focused on debunking urban legends and bogus email forwards — sometimes , but not always , about politics . The final two groups , the AP and ABC News , are conventional news organizations .
The optimistic case for Facebook ’ s fact-checking project is that identifying fake news is an easier and less politically fraught problem than determining when politicians are lying . A common problem for fact-checkers is that their calls are often tied up with the merits of the underlying issues candidates are arguing about .
In a 2012 piece , for example , Hemingway faulted PolitiFact for giving Mitt Romney a “ pants on fire ” rating for claiming that Obama was planning to gut the work requirements of the 1996 welfare reform law . Unsurprisingly , a conservative expert thought Romney ’ s characterization of Obama ’ s proposal was fair game , while more liberal experts thought Romney ’ s criticism was unfair .
It might seem like identifying fake news — at least the kind that ’ s made up out of whole cloth — would be more straightforward .
But if you dig a little deeper into real fake-news controversies , you quickly find that distinguishing real stories from fake ones can require the same kinds of subjective judgment calls required to distinguish between politicians ’ truthful statements and their lies .
Consider , for example , BuzzFeed ’ s list of the five biggest fake news stories in the three months before the election . The top story , Pope Francis endorsing Donald Trump , is obviously fake . But the second and third stories claim that WikiLeaks emails show Hillary Clinton selling weapons to ISIS , and here the verdict isn ’ t so clear .
Snopes examined this claim and found that it contained a “ mixture ” of true and false claims . There is zero evidence that Clinton directly and knowingly sold weapons to ISIS , Snopes concluded . But WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has claimed that leaked documents show Clinton ’ s State Department selling weapons to militants in Libya , some of which ultimately ended up in the hands of ISIS fighters .
Assange ’ s evidence for this claim seems flimsy . But this doesn ’ t seem like “ fake news ” in the sense of being deliberately made up . Whoever wrote that story may have really believed that Clinton ’ s policies led to ISIS fighters getting US weapons .
Another story that was widely branded as fake news claimed that Pepsi CEO Indra Nooyi told Trump supporters to “ take their business elsewhere ” a few days after the election . Nooyi never actually said those words . But she did make comments expressing dismay at Trump ’ s election — comments that conservative sites quickly reported on . In a newsgathering game of telephone , one publication paraphrased Nooyi as telling people to take their business elsewhere , which others then misinterpreted as a direct quotation .
Snopes rated this “ mostly false ” but acknowledged it wasn ’ t completely false — Pepsi ’ s CEO really had made negative comments about Trump ’ s election . And it ’ s not obvious that anyone was trying to be deceptive here ; it was just extremely sloppy journalism .
When they evaluate articles for Facebook , these organizations won ’ t have a “ half true ” or “ mostly false ” option . They ’ re going to have to decide which news stories to rate as fake — thereby branding them as “ disputed ” in the Facebook newsfeed — and which ones to leave alone .
Sharockman says PolitiFact plans to be very conservative about this .
“ We 're looking for clear calls , ” he says . “ We 're going to look for things that we think are not close. ” If an article has shades of gray , he says , PolitiFact will skip it .
But of course , what looks like a shade of gray to one person might look like a clear falsehood to others . No matter what PolitiFact and other fact-checking organizations do , they ’ re likely to make someone unhappy .","In the wake of the 2016 election, Facebook had a problem.

His mother , Jill Tahmooressi , has been a frequent guest on Fox News . Seventy-four Tea Party Congress members have signed on to a letter demanding his release from a Mexican jail and demanding that Barack Obama close the border until Tahmooressi is released . His story has been covered extensively on Fox News and on conservative websites , including Drudge Report , WorldNetDaily and Breitbart .
All of them echo Tahmooressi 's claim that it was a simple mistake that he entered Mexico with a a fully loaded AR-15 5.56 caliber assault-style rifle , a chrome-plated 1911 model Colt .45 caliber pistol , a 12-gauge shotgun , extra clips for the rifle and the pistol and 457 rounds of ammunition . It was an accident , the result of a wrong turn . But like Cliven Bundy and other recent conservative heroes , on closer inspection there are serious problems with Tahmooressi 's story .
Some facts are not in dispute . Andrew Tahmooressi served two tours in Iraq and Afghanistan and was promoted to sergeant before being honorably discharged from the Marine Corps . A native of Weston , Florida , he had recently moved to the San Diego area to receive treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder at the VA hospital in La Jolla . On March 31 , Tahmooressi parked his pickup truck and walked across the border at the El Chaparral crossing from San Ysidro , California , to Tijuana , Mexico . He spent the day in Tijuana and later that night returned to the American side of the border . Then he got into his truck and drove back across the border , where he was arrested at 10:30 p.m. by Mexican authorities .
Tahmooressi and his mother have both consistently claimed that he was driving south on I-5 from La Jolla , on the way to have dinner with friends in San Ysidro , when he missed the last exit before the border and accidentally crossed into Mexico . The first problem with this story is he now admits that he had parked his truck at a lot just north of the border earlier in the day and walked into Tijuana .
That means when he walked back across the border to his truck , he was already as far south as it is possible to be and still be in the U.S . The second problem is the San Ysidro crossing is the busiest land border crossing in the world . It is large , well-marked and brightly lit at night on both sides . Even had he been driving south on I-5 , which we now know he was n't , I-5 is a multilane freeway with numerous signs and ample opportunities to exit and turn around . Even had he somehow missed all of these , there are clearly marked turnaround lines only a few yards from the border .
In the past week new evidence has turned up , including cellphone records and a hotel receipt , that casts even more doubt on Tahmooressi 's story . Far from being unfamiliar with the San Ysidro crossing , as he originally claimed , cellphone and ATM records show that he had crossed the border five or six times in recent weeks . He has now admitted as much , saying he went to visit a Tijuana woman who works in the notorious Zona de Tolerancia , Tijuana 's red light district , with whom he was developing a relationship .
Thanks to a receipt , a copy of which was published in the Tijuana news weekly Zeta , we now know that Tahmooressi had taken a room at the Hotel Nelson , a $ 24 a night `` hot sheet '' hotel on the edge of the Zona de Tolerancia . His mother has confirmed that the receipt is authentic , but claims that Tahmooressi was afraid to spend the night there , which is why he returned to San Ysidro .
In the wake of this new evidence , Tahmooressi has secured new counsel to represent him , his third attorney in four months . Jill Tahmooressi , who had been ever present on Fox News and social media , has gone silent and returned to Florida . A press event scheduled for last week in San Diego to garner support for Tahmooressi was abruptly canceled without explanation . In the meantime , larger signs have been installed at approaches to the border warning that guns are illegal in Mexico and highlighting turnaround areas .
I have a personal interest in this story because I know this border crossing well . The first time I crossed the border at San Ysidro was 37 years ago . I 've crossed the border in both directions dozens of times since , by day and by night . I find it hard to believe , impossible to believe , that one could cross the border accidentally in either direction . This is n't some dusty one-lane crossing between Presidio , Texas , and Ojinaga , where I 've also crossed in both directions and where in days past there might be nobody on duty on either side at night .
If Tahmooressi did not make a wrong turn and cross the border accidentally , as the preponderance of evidence suggests , why would he try to enter Mexico with a small arsenal and hundreds of rounds of ammunition ?
Whatever his reasons , one thing seems sure . Barring a decision by the Mexican government to pardon him , which seems unlikely at this point , it looks like Andrew Tahmooressi could spend a long time in a Mexican prison . It also seems certain that once again the conservative media machine has backed the wrong pony and sold its consumers a story that , to put it mildly , is simply not true . Whatever his intentions were , it 's highly unlikely that this troubled young man suffering PTSD will find the help he needs in a Mexican prison .
Update : At an evidentiary hearing last week , presided over by Judge Victor Octavio Luna Escobedo , Tahmooressi 's attorney , Fernando Benitez , began to lay out his defense . In Benitez 's questioning of the border guards it became clear that he believes the best hope for acquittal is to claim that proper procedures were not followed . Mexican authorities strenuously denied this claim , testifying that standard protocol was strictly followed and that Tahmooressi 's rights under Mexican law were protected at all times .
Both sides said the trial is likely to last at least until November . Tahmooressi 's attorney has asked that a videotape be entered into evidence , hoping the tape , which the defense has not seen , will show the search of Tahmooressi 's truck was somehow illegal . Experts on Mexican law say this is a long shot , but as Tahmooressi is facing a mandatory seven to 14 years in prison , his attorney told reporters his only hope was to secure an outright acquittal .

media_bias,The Nation,0,https://www.thenation.com/article/society/coronavirus-trump-racism/,The Media Is Helping Spread Trump’s Coronavirus Racism,2020-03-20,"Elie Mystal, Dave Zirin, Katrina Vanden Heuvel, Calvin Trillin, Susie Linfield, Joshua Leifer, Mychal Denzel Smith","Faced with mounting pressure over the spread of the coronavirus and his administration ’ s sluggish response to the global pandemic , Donald Trump has gone running for his one true drug . That drug is “ racism , ” and he ’ s ingesting it with a chaser called “ xenophobia. ” Ad Policy
Trump is now blatantly blaming the coronavirus on China . Instead of calling it by its scientific name , Covid-19 , Trump is now using a geographic nickname ( there ’ s no need to repeat it ) and saying that the disease “ comes from China. ” Meanwhile , bigoted Republican senators , like John Cornyn from Texas , are making the connection more explicit , framing Chinese culture and dietary habits as the “ source ” of a string of modern diseases . Cornyn ’ s cultural chauvinism conveniently leaves out how our own dietary habits , which look strange to many parts of the world , contribute to the spread of everything from mad cow disease , in England , to E. coli right here . I wonder if the senator from Texas would have liked it if we called E. coli the “ American Pooping Cowboy Plague . ”
But their hypocrisy doesn ’ t matter . What does matter is that Trump and a number of Republicans are using these terms to distract people from the administration ’ s incompetent response to the virus . They ’ re giving Trump ’ s aggrieved white base somebody else to blame for our problems .
Their words are working . AAPI people from all states and backgrounds are sharing stories of hate and vitriol directed at them and their children . One man told me on Twitter that people are calling his kids “ coronavirus ” at school . An Asian man was sprayed with Febreze on the New York City subway .

Faced with mounting pressure over the spread of the coronavirus and his administration’s sluggish response to the global pandemic, Donald Trump has gone running for his one true drug. That drug is “racism,” and he’s ingesting it with a chaser called “xenophobia.” Ad Policy

Trump is now blatantly blaming the coronavirus on China. Instead of calling it by its scientific name, Covid-19, Trump is now using a geographic nickname (there’s no need to repeat it) and saying that the disease “comes from China.” Meanwhile, bigoted Republican senators, like John Cornyn from Texas, are making the connection more explicit, framing Chinese culture and dietary habits as the “source” of a string of modern diseases. Cornyn’s cultural chauvinism conveniently leaves out how our own dietary habits, which look strange to many parts of the world, contribute to the spread of everything from mad cow disease, in England, to E. coli right here. I wonder if the senator from Texas would have liked it if we called E. coli the “American Pooping Cowboy Plague.”

But their hypocrisy doesn’t matter. What does matter is that Trump and a number of Republicans are using these terms to distract people from the administration’s incompetent response to the virus. They’re giving Trump’s aggrieved white base somebody else to blame for our problems.

Their words are working. AAPI people from all states and backgrounds are sharing stories of hate and vitriol directed at them and their children. One man told me on Twitter that people are calling his kids “coronavirus” at school. An Asian man was sprayed with Febreze on the New York City subway. The NYPD arrested a 13-year-old for allegedly assaulting a 59-year-old man while making anti-Asian comments and shouting something about coronavirus.

If the media were doing their job, this would be the story: The president of the United States is putting lives at risk during a global pandemic by inciting violence against fellow Americans. If Trump were incorrectly blaming the coronavirus on “millionaires and billionaires,” and rich white people were getting beat up on the subway, the press would be all over him to answer for his hateful, divisive rhetoric.

media_bias,"John Gable, AllSides Founder",2,https://onlinejournalismblog.com/2017/02/20/fake-news-allsides-filter-bubbles-john-gable/,OPINION: AllSides’s John Gable: from the Dark Ages of the internet to bursting bubbles,2017-02-20,Andrew Brightwell,"As part of a series of articles on the innovators tackling the filter bubble phenomenon , Andrew Brightwell interviews John Gable , founder and CEO of AllSides , a website that has devised its own way to present alternative perspectives on American news .
When a man who helped build the first successful web browser says there ’ s something wrong with the Internet , it probably pays to listen .
John Gable ’ s diagnosis has authority : he has more than 30 years in the tech business , including stints at Microsoft , AOL and as a product manager for Netscape Navigator .
Now he is founder and CEO of AllSides Inc , a news website with a distinct mission . Visit AllSides.com and it offers the news you ’ d expect on any US politics site , except that its lead stories include a choice of articles : one from the left , centre and right .
“ The headlines are so radically different that even reading [ them together ] tells you more about that topic than reading one story all the way through . ”
On first visiting AllSides I find myself drawn in directions I don ’ t normally take – towards right-wing pieces , from sites like the National Review , the Washington Times or Fox News .
This is AllSides ’ intention : to push the comfortably certain in new directions . With The Echo Chamber Club and Read Across The Aisle , AllSides is at the vanguard of a movement against political polarisation of the web .
When you click on one story you ’ re offered a range of alternatives . Browsing AllSides is like an odyssey through American political opinion .
“ We think that the best way to serve humanity is a free flow of information . And when you talk about something that ’ s false , fake news or something like that , we have always solved it by showing the report that says it ’ s fake news right next to it . ”
But it ’ s just the start . AllSides plans to fix the whole of the web , starting with news .
For John , the seeds of the Internet ’ s demise were evident even when hopes it would usher in a new era of openness and democracy remained unblemished .
Speaking over Skype from his office in the San Francisco Bay Area , he says :
“ I gave a speech in January of ‘ 97 saying I was afraid it might not work out that way ; that , as a result of the overwhelming information from the Internet and the way we connect , we may actually be trained to think in terms of categories or discriminate in new ways . ”
So it has proved . Following Donald Trump ’ s election , critics have attacked Google and Facebook for their part in a breakdown of veracity and civility in public discourse .
At the heart of their critiques are the concepts of fake news and ‘ filter bubbles ’ , in which social media users are insulated from views they ’ ll find disagreeable .
“ We are less informed today than we were 10 years ago , even 200 years ago , on controversial topics . I ’ d say we are more confidently ignorant , because we hear a small piece of the answer so many times that we ’ re convinced that ’ s correct . ”
John tells me that by inferring authority from the number of links a web page attracts , the Internet is vulnerable to distortion .
“ To deal with all this overwhelming information , Google started with the idea of references in libraries , so if this is cited by a lot of different sources , it must be a good one . “ Well , for controversial subjects it ’ s [ polarised content ] that becomes what is most popular . ”
Those who shout loudest and rudest win out , because they are more likely to attract attention and , therefore , links .
“ A third of the clicks from a Google search page go to the number-one result ; 92 per cent go to the first page , ” he says .
Recent history leaves us unprepared for the consequences . John mentions Walter Cronkite , a US news anchor of the 60s , 70s and 80s , who is synonymous with unblinking trust for the news .
“ Walter Cronkite was the aberration . What people didn ’ t realise was that back in history we recognised that the media was biased . And if you wanted to understand , you had to look at different points of view . People understood that . ”
John likens today ’ s age of Internet disruption to the arrival of the printing press , which he says also resulted in wild speculation , rumour and violence .
“ Not until society had learned how to use that new earth-shattering technology did things get better and the Reformation happened . “ I believe we ’ re in the Dark Ages of the Internet , when it comes to controversial topics . ”
AllSides has been going for a little more than four years ; not long enough to start a new enlightenment , but enough to shed a little light .
That has started with the development of a patented ‘ crowd-driven ’ political bias rating .
Visitors to the site are invited to take part in a blind rating of news publishers ’ politics , after their own bias is tested to enable a representative sample .
John says it took trial and error to arrive at the system , with AllSides first using a Wikipedia model that relied on crowd-sourced editing and writing .
“ We found that that was too slow . That the information flow online is so quick that you can ’ t have a bunch of people write about it and think about it . ”
The site identifies five grades of political view : Left , lean-left , centre , lean-right , and right .
In the interests of transparency , AllSides publishes its staff members ’ ratings . ( John , who once worked for the Republican party , is rated as lean-right . )
A system that makes bias transparent isn ’ t without controversy . Many journalists insist reporting is politically neutral . John says the chief editor of one prominent ‘ liberal ’ publication simply couldn ’ t accept that his output could be rated .
“ His basic argument was that the news is either right or wrong . And the idea that there was any bias in anything they or anybody did was… I mean he really was sweating and turning red and stuff . ”
Such encounters are uncommon , however , and away from journalism the bias rating offers advantages .
John explains that AllSides is used by teachers in 38 out of 50 US states .
“ If [ teachers ] bring up politics , there are two big things that frighten them . One is that their class themselves will get very divided and angry of each other , so you create chaos in the classroom . The other is that parents and administrators will charge them for being biased in one way or another . “ And that ’ s a very big concern . We remove both of those problems . ”
The site has also proved popular with visitors from outside the US , who John says come for a unique perspective on US politics by seeing all sides of the argument .
No doubt foreign visitor numbers grew in the wake of Donald Trump ’ s victory , and the preceding ill-tempered electoral race , which in turn has piqued interest in the site ’ s mission .
“ Certainly six months before the election we had to explain filter bubbles , and how that was a problem . Now people explain it to us . ”
This offers new opportunities . To date , the site has had more than 2.2 million unique visitors , but is sustained by donations , “ thousands of hours of free work ” and John ’ s own funds .
“ Before [ the election ] we would go to some venture capitalists or funders and they ’ d be like , ‘ oh that ’ s nice. ’ Now we have them calling us , which has not happened before . “ So we are scrambling , frankly , to build a business model , to raise the money to take this big-time . ”
But John says a long term income strategy is likely to include affiliate selling and advertising .
“ It ’ s the old kind of mantra from news journalism early on , where news never made money , news was only used to sell classifieds . And we ’ ll do the same kind of thing . “ But there are lots of things we will not do . The click-baiting things that you see a lot of journalists do , I think that a lot of media companies have an addiction to bad media practices that help them make a little bit more money this next week or next month , but ultimately kills their credibility . ”
Such a strategy will benefit from the site ’ s high Google rankings and build on topic-specific ‘ evergreen ’ content about political issues that AllSides writes itself .
John isn ’ t yet happy with AllSides ’ mobile experience , but the site is already most popular among Millennials . He says young people are more likely to change their behaviour on learning of a bias , but are also more vulnerable to filter bubbles . That ’ s because they mostly get their news from Facebook and other social media .
“ It ’ s kind of getting news by accident . When you get news by accident you ’ re getting bubbled . You ’ re in a serious filter bubble . “ If you ’ re just getting it as it comes to you , you ’ re being very brainwashed in one way or another . ”
The site also has a dialogue section , where it allows readers to join debates on chosen subjects – and has been trialling video conversations with small groups .
“ Now we ’ re trying to figure out a way to show it to the rest of the world and let other people in participate in it . ”
John says AllSides wants to find partners in the UK and elsewhere to develop the website for different territories .
“ It ’ s a big problem and we do have a unique way of solving it that other people haven ’ t figured out yet . ”
After interviewing John , Mark Zuckerberg , Facebook ’ s CEO , publishes a 5,000-plus word broadside on ‘ Building Global Community ’ . He shares some of his thoughts on how the company plans to tackle filter bubbles and fake news , warning there ’ s no quick fix .
“ Research shows that some of the most obvious ideas , like showing people an article from the opposite perspective , actually deepen polarisation by framing other perspectives as foreign . “ A more effective approach is to show a range of perspectives , let people see where their views are on a spectrum and come to a conclusion on what they think is right . ”
It ’ s striking how similar this is to AllSides ’ approach , so I ask John if they have had any contact .
He says they have networked with some people at the firm and are hoping to have more in-depth conversations soon . He ’ s also pleased with Zuckerberg ’ s approach .
“ We have seen other groups jump into this space recently and , despite good intentions , make the kinds of mistakes that Zuckerberg describes . “ We are happy to see Facebook taking this seriously and looking more deeply at the problem rather than just taking some short-term , knee-jerk steps that might not have good long term consequences . ”","As part of a series of articles on the innovators tackling the filter bubble phenomenon, Andrew Brightwell interviews John Gable, founder and CEO of AllSides, a website that has devised its own way to present alternative perspectives on American news.

But it’s just the start. AllSides plans to fix the whole of the web, starting with news.

Linking failure

For John, the seeds of the Internet’s demise were evident even when hopes it would usher in a new era of openness and democracy remained unblemished.

Speaking over Skype from his office in the San Francisco Bay Area, he says:

“I gave a speech in January of ‘97 saying I was afraid it might not work out that way; that, as a result of the overwhelming information from the Internet and the way we connect, we may actually be trained to think in terms of categories or discriminate in new ways.”

So it has proved. Following Donald Trump’s election, critics have attacked Google and Facebook for their part in a breakdown of veracity and civility in public discourse.

At the heart of their critiques are the concepts of fake news and ‘filter bubbles’, in which social media users are insulated from views they’ll find disagreeable.

“We are less informed today than we were 10 years ago, even 200 years ago, on controversial topics. I’d say we are more confidently ignorant, because we hear a small piece of the answer so many times that we’re convinced that’s correct.”

The Dark Ages of the Internet

John tells me that by inferring authority from the number of links a web page attracts, the Internet is vulnerable to distortion.

“To deal with all this overwhelming information, Google started with the idea of references in libraries, so if this is cited by a lot of different sources, it must be a good one. “Well, for controversial subjects it’s [polarised content] that becomes what is most popular.”

Those who shout loudest and rudest win out, because they are more likely to attract attention and, therefore, links.

“A third of the clicks from a Google search page go to the number-one result; 92 per cent go to the first page,” he says.

Recent history leaves us unprepared for the consequences. John mentions Walter Cronkite, a US news anchor of the 60s, 70s and 80s, who is synonymous with unblinking trust for the news.

“Walter Cronkite was the aberration. What people didn’t realise was that back in history we recognised that the media was biased. And if you wanted to understand, you had to look at different points of view. People understood that.”

John likens today’s age of Internet disruption to the arrival of the printing press, which he says also resulted in wild speculation, rumour and violence.

“Not until society had learned how to use that new earth-shattering technology did things get better and the Reformation happened. “I believe we’re in the Dark Ages of the Internet, when it comes to controversial topics.”

The ratings game

AllSides has been going for a little more than four years; not long enough to start a new enlightenment, but enough to shed a little light.

That has started with the development of a patented ‘crowd-driven’ political bias rating.

Visitors to the site are invited to take part in a blind rating of news publishers’ politics, after their own bias is tested to enable a representative sample.

John says it took trial and error to arrive at the system, with AllSides first using a Wikipedia model that relied on crowd-sourced editing and writing.

“We found that that was too slow. That the information flow online is so quick that you can’t have a bunch of people write about it and think about it.”

The site identifies five grades of political view: Left, lean-left, centre, lean-right, and right.

In the interests of transparency, AllSides publishes its staff members’ ratings. (John, who once worked for the Republican party, is rated as lean-right.)

A system that makes bias transparent isn’t without controversy. Many journalists insist reporting is politically neutral. John says the chief editor of one prominent ‘liberal’ publication simply couldn’t accept that his output could be rated.

“His basic argument was that the news is either right or wrong. And the idea that there was any bias in anything they or anybody did was… I mean he really was sweating and turning red and stuff.”

Such encounters are uncommon, however, and away from journalism the bias rating offers advantages.

No doubt foreign visitor numbers grew in the wake of Donald Trump’s victory, and the preceding ill-tempered electoral race, which in turn has piqued interest in the site’s mission.

“Certainly six months before the election we had to explain filter bubbles, and how that was a problem. Now people explain it to us.”

This offers new opportunities. To date, the site has had more than 2.2 million unique visitors, but is sustained by donations, “thousands of hours of free work” and John’s own funds.

“Before [the election] we would go to some venture capitalists or funders and they’d be like, ‘oh that’s nice.’ Now we have them calling us, which has not happened before. “So we are scrambling, frankly, to build a business model, to raise the money to take this big-time.”

But John says a long term income strategy is likely to include affiliate selling and advertising.

“It’s the old kind of mantra from news journalism early on, where news never made money, news was only used to sell classifieds. And we’ll do the same kind of thing. “But there are lots of things we will not do. The click-baiting things that you see a lot of journalists do, I think that a lot of media companies have an addiction to bad media practices that help them make a little bit more money this next week or next month, but ultimately kills their credibility.”

Such a strategy will benefit from the site’s high Google rankings and build on topic-specific ‘evergreen’ content about political issues that AllSides writes itself.

Starting the conversation

John isn’t yet happy with AllSides’ mobile experience, but the site is already most popular among Millennials. He says young people are more likely to change their behaviour on learning of a bias, but are also more vulnerable to filter bubbles. That’s because they mostly get their news from Facebook and other social media.

“It’s kind of getting news by accident. When you get news by accident you’re getting bubbled. You’re in a serious filter bubble. “If you’re just getting it as it comes to you, you’re being very brainwashed in one way or another.”

The site also has a dialogue section, where it allows readers to join debates on chosen subjects – and has been trialling video conversations with small groups.

“Now we’re trying to figure out a way to show it to the rest of the world and let other people in participate in it.”

John says AllSides wants to find partners in the UK and elsewhere to develop the website for different territories.

“It’s a big problem and we do have a unique way of solving it that other people haven’t figured out yet.”

Post script: The Facebook connection

After interviewing John, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s CEO, publishes a 5,000-plus word broadside on ‘Building Global Community’. He shares some of his thoughts on how the company plans to tackle filter bubbles and fake news, warning there’s no quick fix.

“Research shows that some of the most obvious ideas, like showing people an article from the opposite perspective, actually deepen polarisation by framing other perspectives as foreign. “A more effective approach is to show a range of perspectives, let people see where their views are on a spectrum and come to a conclusion on what they think is right.”

It’s striking how similar this is to AllSides’ approach, so I ask John if they have had any contact.

He says they have networked with some people at the firm and are hoping to have more in-depth conversations soon. He’s also pleased with Zuckerberg’s approach.

“We have seen other groups jump into this space recently and, despite good intentions, make the kinds of mistakes that Zuckerberg describes. “We are happy to see Facebook taking this seriously and looking more deeply at the problem rather than just taking some short-term, knee-jerk steps that might not have good long term consequences.”

Despite Their Claims, China Has Not Beaten the Coronavirus

Nobody Wants to Be Dependent upon Chinese Imports Anymore

Meanwhile, the United States isn’t the only country that suddenly finds the thought of being dependent upon Chinese exports of medical equipment and supplies unacceptable:

Suga’s remarks reflect something much broader than a temporary policy response to the current crisis.

Does the Chinese government look and sound like a group of leaders that are confident that they are winning the battle of world opinion? They’re banning Australian beef imports after Australia called for an inquiry into the origin of the outbreak. A Chinese coast-guard ship intentionally rammed and sank a Vietnamese fishing vessel last month. Chinese coast-guard ships are straying into Japanese territorial waters.

Does this county look stable to you? Or does China look like a powder keg, with a lot of angry people who have a whole lot of good reasons to be angry? And does the government in Beijing look like a bunch of strategic masterminds, or do they look like they have only one play in their playbook: attempting to steer public anger into angry nationalism, over and over and over again?

Trust Only Those Who Get Arrested

Finally, elsewhere in China, a new study out of the Shandong First Medical University concludes, “Our paper shows very clearly that these events occur naturally in wildlife. This provides strong evidence against SARS-CoV-2 being a laboratory escape.”

Notice that the Chinese authorities want to blur the line between “occurred naturally in wildlife” and “laboratory escape.” You can take naturally occurring viruses into a lab, either as part of a sample or as part of a research animal, and then that virus can get out of that lab — either through the accidental infection of a lab worker, or through the improper disposal of biological material. This literally happened twice separately with SARS in a laboratory in Beijing in 2004.

I can understand why a Chinese scientist would insist a laboratory mistake is impossible. Zhang Xuezhong, a prominent Chinese legal scholar, argued on social media that restrictions on freedom of expression had made it more difficult for the country to contain the outbreak, and criticized the Chinese government’s arrest and suppression of Wuhan doctor Li Wenliang. He promptly got detained by police for a day and later released.

With consequences as fast and dire as that, do you think any Chinese scientist is going to admit, “yes, mistakes happen, and this virus could have been one of ours”?

My guess is that unless you’re making a deliberate effort to keep up with news out of China, you haven’t heard much about any of these developments.

You’ve probably heard about that restaurant in Colorado that was open and crowded on Mother’s Day. You’ve probably heard about the president and vice president not wearing masks. You may have heard about Twitter establishing new rules to fight disinformation about the coronavirus — but you probably haven’t heard that those rules won’t apply to the January World Health Organization tweets declaring that the virus could not be spread from one human to another.

We have a national media — news pages, editorial pages, radio, television, web, and cable news — that is just clogged with people who know how to tell one story and who only want to tell one story: “Democrats are the good guys, Republicans are the bad guys.” Even if you agreed with that — I obviously don’t — the world is way more complicated than that. When a story like this virus and China come along, they can only perceive the events through that preexisting lens.

ADDENDUM: Because you’re probably looking for things to look forward to: Baseball will probably be back sometime around July 4; the film version of Hamilton is coming to Disney+ this July 3; Disney still intends to release the live-action “Mulan” in theaters in July; and the second season of “The Mandalorian” will arrive as scheduled in October.",www.nationalreview.com,right,iqd3rbCnrAs1ydh3

Unfair, Unbalanced

In a comparative study of the two tragedies published in 1991, political scientist Robert Entman points out that with KAL 007, the angle taken by the US media “emphasized the moral bankruptcy and guilt of the perpetrating nation.” With Iran Air 655, “the frame de-emphasized guilt and focused on the complex problems of operating military high technology.”

In the two weeks after destruction, KAL 007 got far more coverage than Iran Air 655: 51 pages for KAL 007 compared with 20 for Iran Air 655 in Time and Newsweek; and 286 articles compared with 102 in The New York Times.

But when the missile was American, the tone changed; there was no talk of atrocities or intentionality, and the language became passive, as if the massacre had no perpetrator. Newsweek’s headline was “Why it happened” (July 18, 1988). Time put a story about travel to Mars on its front cover, relegating Iran Air 655 to inside pages under “What went wrong in the Gulf.” For KAL 007, the most common terms used in The Washington Post and The New York Times were “brutal[ly],” “barbaric/barbarous,” “deliberate[ly],” “murderous”; for Iran Air 655 they were “mistaken[ly],” “tragic[ally],” “fatal[ly],” “understandable,” “justified.” Does one need to be told when journalists wrote of “innocent human beings,” “269 stories of personal poignancy” and “loved ones,” and when, more soberly, they referred to “passengers,” “travelers,” and “those who died”?

After the high point of his inauguration , I ’ d say Obama has gotten pretty rough coverage that fairly mirrors the rough passage of his fifth year in office . This has been capped by the last two months , with the ObamaCare fiasco dominating the coverage and casting doubt on the competence of the president and his team .
Even the improvements made to the health care website hasn ’ t spared the Obama team fresh criticism that some of the information being submitted to insurance companies is inaccurate , which could leave many without coverage .
And the lack of a significant domestic accomplishment leaves Obama ’ s defenders with few talking points . You know you ’ re having time when the only relief you get is talking to the Iranians about nukes ( and even that agreement is proving a tough sell on the Hill ) .
Now , thanks to a journalistic convention , Obama is starting to get hit by a new wave of negative press . As we head into the Christmas season , the pundits are easing into their year-end wrap-ups , and are turning thumbs-down on the president ’ s tenure .
“ By almost any measure , this has been a lost year for Obama on the domestic front , ” says the Washington Post ’ s Dan Balz . “ The flawed rollout of the health-care law , the most important initiative of his tenure , has been a huge setback . His main legislative efforts have either disappeared or are stalled . The economy continues to improve , but the fruits have been unevenly distributed . The government shutdown damaged the opposition , but the president ’ s ratings also are at record lows .
“ This is hardly what Obama could have envisioned as he looked toward his second term in the weeks after his reelection . ”
Balz is always measured in his judgments , so that amounts to a serious slam .
Chuck Todd and his co-authors at MSNBC echo the tone :
“ It ’ s worth recapping how rough 2013 has been for President Obama . The struggles with the federal website ( more on that below ) have dominated the last two months , and have sent his approval ratings to new lows . But before that , it was the damaging NSA/Snowden leaks . Before that , it was the IRS-Benghazi-leak stories ( which have definitely lost their punch since the summer ) . And before that , it was the failure to get gun-control through the U.S. Senate . ”
And Politico has this telling quote from GOP strategist Alex Castellanos about the impact on Hillary :
“ Hillary Clinton is the life raft on Obama ’ s sinking ship : Obama ’ s troops would be a lot less likely to abandon ship if she wasn ’ t around . Hillary has to separate from Obama to win the general election but has to hug him close to win the nomination . If she leaves any room in the primaries between Obama and her own candidacy , she creates an opening for Elizabeth Warren . It ’ s going to be a tough call to figure out how close to hug the leper . ”
So according to this admittedly partisan analysis , the prospect of Hillary winning in 2016 is helping Barack in 2013 because she ’ s his former secretary of State .
But is it helping Hillary ? Another Politico piece—this one about Chuck Hagel—contains this revealing comment from a former Bill Clinton defense official who recently turned down a Pentagon job :
“ To some extent you are seeing the Clinton effect . Why take the risks of working in a second Obama administration , when you can make $ 300,000 in the private sector and then go work for Hillary ? ”
Because she might not win ? Besides , Obama still has three years to go . And National Journal ’ s Ron Fournier , who has been harping on Obama ’ s lack of leadership , says :
“ President Obama needs to fire himself . Not literally , of course , but practically : He needs to shake up his team so thoroughly that the new blood imposes change on how he manages the federal bureaucracy and leads .
“ A series of self-inflicted wounds during his fifth year in office , capped by the botched launch of the Affordable Care Act , have Americans questioning the president 's competence and credibility . ”
We ’ ll give the final word to First Read , with its inevitable Chuck Todd college football reference :
“ But here ’ s the thing about politics : It can change in the blink of an eye . Who ’ s up can go down ; who ’ s down can go up . And as we found out on Saturday , someone can run back a missed field goal kick 108 yards for an improbable come-from-behind victory . ”
If the odds of the president bouncing back are the same as that crazy play that won Auburn the game , he ’ s in trouble .
The New York Times ’ decision to illustrate a story about breast cancer in Israel with a front-page photo of a victim ’ s breasts , with a partially exposed nipple , has kicked up quite a debate . I said on “ Media Buzz ” that I thought the picture went too far and seemed a provocative departure for the Gray Lady .
Now the unnamed 28-year-old has put out a statement , carried by Public Editor Margaret Sullivan :
“ When I first saw the photo I did not find it either provocative or inappropriate . I thought it was powerful and told my story – I am a proud , young Jewish woman who had breast cancer , and I have a scar that proves it .

The Woman Behind the Breast Photo

The New York Times’ decision to illustrate a story about breast cancer in Israel with a front-page photo of a victim’s breasts, with a partially exposed nipple, has kicked up quite a debate. I said on “Media Buzz” that I thought the picture went too far and seemed a provocative departure for the Gray Lady.

Now the unnamed 28-year-old has put out a statement, carried by Public Editor Margaret Sullivan:

“When I first saw the photo I did not find it either provocative or inappropriate. I thought it was powerful and told my story – I am a proud, young Jewish woman who had breast cancer, and I have a scar that proves it.

“I am not ashamed or embarrassed by the scar. Most of my breast was not exposed and the small part that was does not make the picture ‘cheap.’ I think it’s very artistic.

“I didn’t expect such controversy around the photo – but I’m glad the photo caused an impact since I believe that there should be more awareness about breast cancer, genetic testing, the conflict of ‘what to do’ with a positive result, etc.

“I agreed to publish the photo since I wanted to raise awareness, but I decided to leave my identity unknown because I didn’t want to become famous because I had cancer. The cancer I fought this past year is a part of me, but it’s not who I am. It’s not me. In addition, this photo was taken spontaneously and I didn’t consult my close family beforehand, so I preferred to stay unknown.

“In response to some readers’ comment on the tattoo I have on my body, I come from a family of Holocaust survivors.”

Whatever the journalistic propriety of the decision, I’m glad to get the perspective of the woman involved.

Booker Bashful?

This made me laugh.

“Cory Booker Shuns Spotlight,” blares the Politico headline.

And what is the lead anecdote showing that after one entire month in office, the New Jersey senator is keeping a low profile?

After coming off the floor on the vote to change the filibuster rule, he blew off a Politico reporter: “I got a lot of thoughts, but I’m not going to share them right now.”

I mean, how dare he?

It 's now a party . ''
To which the unfortunate soul who had been watching MSNBC since Super Tuesday morning — it me — could only answer , `` Define what you mean , sir , by 'party . ' ''
From the perspective of a very tired observer at home , Williams ' usage of the term associated with frivolity and celebration seemed to be pushing it a bit . He could not have been talking about unity among the Democrats , not as of the latest hours on Tuesday and early Wednesday .
The earliest numbers pointed to a split between Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden , with the former presumed to be the frontrunner headed into this primary slugfest and the latter thought to be all but dead until a few days ago .
Based on what was happening onscreen , Williams was referring to the candidates ' razor thin margin of votes in Texas , where Sanders led for a time until Biden overtook him ; NBC finally called Biden as the projected winner close at to 2 a.m. Eastern . California was projected to go to Sanders .
Even special coverage co-anchor Rachel Maddow seemed uncharacteristically less-than-animated as Biden 's shocking competitiveness drew out calls for projected winners in Massachusetts , which the former veep won in an upset over Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren — quite the blow , considering Massachusetts is her home state . By around 10 p.m.m PT , or 1 a.m . ET for the news team , `` The Rachel Maddow Show '' host honestly looked like she 'd rather be anywhere else .
We sympathize . Tough as it must be to facilitate hours upon hours of MSNBC primaries coverage , it 's even more deflating to watch hour after hour knowing that the best-case scenario would have been ousted anchor Chris Matthews 's or Chuck Todd 's nightmare , otherwise known as Sanders clinching the nomination . Todd 's part in MSNBC 's coverage shrank as the day headed into prime-time which , given what happened to the host of `` Hardball '' a day ago and viewers ' general disdain for the guy these days , is understandable .
On the other hand , that would have caused a little bit more spark in the form of apoplectic fits on the part of its contributors such as Rev . Al Sharpton or Democratic strategist James Carville , who took a moment for saluting South Carolina congressman and House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn as the guy who `` literally saved the Democratic Party . ''
And while I would n't go as far as to accuse MSNBC of being in the bag for any single candidate prior to Tuesday night and early Wednesday morning , the general mood at witnessing Biden 's strong showing on Tuesday could most accurately be characterized as `` pleasant surprise . '' The only person who appeared to be partying was Steve Kornacki , multimedia anchor , data analyst and Lord of the Interactive Graphics Screen .
All election nights place Kornacki in his element , as he rolls up his sleeves and dashes about , circling districts and vigorously walking viewers through scenarios involving vote totals on the district level . With Matthews gone it fell to Kornacki to pump some life into the place with his increasingly animated assessments of `` Too Close to Call '' states , and why a rout they thought would favor a Democratic socialist went to an establishment-friendly moderate .
Candidate political analyst and `` Deadline : White House '' host Nicolle Wallace underscored the important of Biden 's unexpected gains , reminded viewers he was `` flat broke '' and has n't had a single ad on the air .
`` The Democratic establishment had essentially turned their back on Joe Biden before Saturday night , '' Wallace offered . What changed ? The suspended election campaigns of former Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and their subsequent endorsements helped a bit ; Klobuchar 's was seen as key to Biden 's Minnesota primary victory .
There was also the long-talked about ability for Biden to attract support from the party 's African America base . Carville specifically cited Clyburn 's endorsement of Biden as crucial to his wins in South Carolina and other Southern states before turning to a bit of premature grave dancing . `` I think we 're going to see obviously Bloomberg and Warren are not long for this world … I 'd like someone on the panel to weigh in on this . We might see Democrats starting to ask Sanders , 'let 's do n't drag this thing out any more than we have to . ' ''
Political analysts far savvier than yours truly will have more strongly sourced breakdowns as to how something that the average person who 's been paying attention would have guessed would happen did happen .
MSNBC host Joy Reid concisely summarized the prevailing theory by saying , `` Think of Joe Biden as being like Coca Cola , right ? So if I have Coca Cola , and you make a soda , I still have Coca Cola . It 's very difficult to change that brand . Biden has a known brand , particularly to the voters who really handed it to him tonight , which is Black voters . ''
Much earlier in the day , however , the anchors cited `` the invisible hand of Barack Obama '' in providing Biden with a last-minute boost , as if Obama were Mr. Wizard or some DC Comics all-powerful being from Oa . This played off an NBC News article citing `` people close to Obama '' and other unnamed Democratic sources referencing the former president 's `` hidden hand '' and alluding to the hidden machinations of the Democratic elite .
There may be something to that . But it 's more likely that , as Reid says , the Biden Brand is more familiar to a larger swath of the population , leading primary voters to cast their votes for him as opposed to Sanders or Warren .
Among viewers searching for evidence of a Warren media blackout , MSNBC did little to assuage their concerns or debunk their complaints . They covered the night as a two-way race between Biden and Sanders , with Bloomberg pressing into the top three here and there . The numbers backed up this tale , save for with the Massachusetts results , which producers again skewed by showing only the two men in competition , leaving Maddow to hit the pause button and point out emphatically that Warren still had a strong showing in the exit polls , before asking why MSNBC was treating her as if she were not in contention .
That 's also a fair question considering that earlier in its broadcast coverage the network cut to a Warren campaign top to hear her speech , only to cut away mid-run .

Given the record of secrecy , duplicity , and coverup by the Communist government of China , there is little cause to take those official figures at anything close to face value . Nevertheless , Western media organizations , the World Health Organization , and the United Nations have taken to referring to China 's numbers as “ confirmed cases ” comparable to cases in other countries with more open societies and transparent governments , giving the impression that China has largely conquered the virus .
The Chinese government department responsible for tracking statistics during the crisis is the National Health Commission of the People 's Republic of China . The commission 's website has been publishing daily updates since late January . From the first report on January 25 , the number of cases of the now-named COVID-19 virus skyrocketed from 1,287 to 17,205 in just over a week . At that point , according to the commission , 189,583 people had “ been identified as having had close contact with infected patients . ”
On top of this , the commission acknowledged on January 26 that “ More than 5 million people have left Wuhan due to the Spring Festival and epidemic [ . ] ” From all appearances , the “ epidemic ” was poised to sweep the nation of 1.3 billion people , exacerbated by the timing : an annual festival that typically generates nearly 3 billion trips , the “ largest annual human migration in the world . ”
Against all odds , however , the National Health Commission of China , a little more than six weeks later , reported no new domestically acquired cases , attributing every new case as “ imported ” by those returning to China . Over the last half of March , despite the massive dispersion of Chinese citizens from the epicenter of the virus , Wuhan , the commission has reported barely one new domestically acquired case per day . While in mid-March , 683,281 people had “ been identified as having had close contact with infected patients ” with “ 9,144 are now under medical observation , ” new cases remained a trickle .
Despite compelling reasons for incredulity at China 's official figures , on March 16 , the United Nations published an article titled “ China shows COVID-19 Coronavirus can be ‘ stopped in its tracks. ’ ” The article is based on an interview with a “ WHO Representative in the country , Dr. Gauden Galea . ”
“ It is an epidemic that has been nipped as it was growing and stopped in its tracks . This is very clear from the data that we have , as well as the observations that we can see in society in general , ” he told UN News in Beijing on Saturday .
But based on the same article , Dr. Galea has been in Beijing during the course of China 's battle with COVID-19 , except for a quick trip to Wuhan on January 21-22 before the city was even locked down and the outbreak was still muted . The U.N. article goes on to say : “ At the time , there was no overwhelming demand on the health services , though the situation had changed when Chinese and international health experts conducted a joint mission a month later. ” A “ joint mission , ” indicating that the Chinese government would have maintained its control over WHO 's access to data and physical sites .
Various media organizations have similarly relied on China 's numbers for some pretty dramatic headlines . On March 18 , the New York Times declared : “ China Hits a Coronavirus Milestone : No New Local Infections. ” While the article notes in passing that Chinese “ officials initially concealed and mismanaged the outbreak , ” it goes on to flatly assert that “ Beijing ’ s sledgehammer approach ... worked to quickly lower the number of infections [ . ] ” Axios headlined a similar report “ No new coronavirus cases in Wuhan , China , where global pandemic began , ” while NPR went with ” China Reports No New Domestic Cases , But Battles Coronavirus Imported From Abroad . ”
Eight days later , the Times , again based on China 's “ confirmed ” numbers , told the world that , “ The U.S. Now Leads the World in Confirmed Coronavirus Cases. ” While the article says that “ The Times is engaged in a comprehensive effort to track the details of every confirmed case in the United States , collecting information from federal , state and local officials , ” apparently the Times applied considerably less rigor to acquire information on China .
On Monday , however , came news that China 's numbers have indeed been incomplete . The Wall Street Journal reported that “ China said more than 1,500 people who were infected with the virus but haven ’ t shown symptoms weren ’ t included in its national tally of confirmed cases. ” While other countries are struggling to keep up with statistics on cases , the change so late in China 's experience with the virus raises further questions about China 's transparency , especially in light of some of the drastic measures the Communist government took early on to hush up the extent and seriousness of the epidemic .
If the past is any indication , the Chinese government will continue to hide the true consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak in that country as best it can .

“ This is perhaps the most on-message moment of Donald Trump ’ s presidency today . We were all wondering if he would veer from his remarks , go off of his script but he stayed on script , stayed on message and , I think , rose to the moment , ” Acosta said on CNN immediately following the speech .
JIM ACOSTA 'S CNN ROLE FURTHER MUDDLED BY UPCOMING BOOK : 'YOU CAN ’ T TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIM AND A PAID PUNDIT
The CNN White House reporter is often combative with Trump and members of his administration but praised Trump ’ s remark that the men who stormed the beach are among the greatest Americans who have ever lived .
“ That could not be more of a fact check true , ” Acosta said . “ It was really one of those moments that Donald Trump needed to rise to in order to , I think , walk away from the cemetery , walk away from this hallowed ground and have people back at home saying , ‘ You know what , no matter what I think about the current president of the United States , he said the right thing at Normandy . He did the right thing at Normandy . ’ ”

Acosta then said Trump “ hit all of the right moments ” when paying respect to the D-Day heroes .
Over on MSNBC , recurrent Trump critic Scarborough echoed Acosta ’ s thoughts .
“ [ Trump ] delivered what , again , I believe is the strongest speech of his presidency , ” Scarborough said , noting that it was a “ beautiful moment ” when Trump acknowledged that many of the troops feel the “ heroes were the ones that never came back ” but the survivors formed a remarkable generation .
‘ UNMASKED ’ BOOK RANKS MEDIA MEMBERS WHO HATE PRESIDENT TRUMP THE MOST , FROM JIM ACOSTA TO MIKA BRZEZINSKI
Viewers on the pair of liberal networks were presumably shocked , as Acosta and Scarborough typically condemn Trump ’ s every step . Acosta even has a book coming out titled , “ The Enemy of the People : A Dangerous Time to Tell the Truth in America , ” which is billed as “ an explosive , first-hand account of the dangers [ Acosta ] faces reporting on the current White House while fighting on the front lines in President Trump ’ s war on truth ” as “ public enemy number one . ”
Acosta , who has raised eyebrows inside CNN for blurring the line between reporter and pundit , was recently named the media member who “ hates ” Trump the most by “ Unmasked — Big Media 's War Against Trump ” authors L. Brent Bozell III and Tim Graham of the Media Research Center .
“ He would proudly wear the moniker of the face of the Resistance if it was bestowed on him by us , but we won ’ t do that . No man in the world of journalism has made a mockery of his profession quite like this man , ” Bozell and Graham wrote .
MSNBC ’ s “ Morning Joe ” duo Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski share the second spot on the list of media members who clearly loathe the president . The married co-hosts were famously tight with Trump before eventually turning on him . They now criticize the president on a regular basis , but Scarborough had nothing but positive remarks about Trump ’ s D-Day speech .","President Trump’s speech on Thursday honoring the brave Allied fighters who ""stood in the fires of hell"" on the 75th anniversary of D-Day drew unexpected acclaim from two of his biggest mainstream media critics: CNN’s Jim Acosta and MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough.

Over on MSNBC, recurrent Trump critic Scarborough echoed Acosta’s thoughts.

“[Trump] delivered what, again, I believe is the strongest speech of his presidency,” Scarborough said, noting that it was a “beautiful moment” when Trump acknowledged that many of the troops feel the “heroes were the ones that never came back” but the survivors formed a remarkable generation.

‘UNMASKED’ BOOK RANKS MEDIA MEMBERS WHO HATE PRESIDENT TRUMP THE MOST, FROM JIM ACOSTA TO MIKA BRZEZINSKI

Viewers on the pair of liberal networks were presumably shocked, as Acosta and Scarborough typically condemn Trump’s every step. Acosta even has a book coming out titled, “The Enemy of the People: A Dangerous Time to Tell the Truth in America,” which is billed as “an explosive, first-hand account of the dangers [Acosta] faces reporting on the current White House while fighting on the front lines in President Trump’s war on truth” as “public enemy number one.”

Acosta, who has raised eyebrows inside CNN for blurring the line between reporter and pundit, was recently named the media member who “hates” Trump the most by “Unmasked — Big Media's War Against Trump” authors L. Brent Bozell III and Tim Graham of the Media Research Center.

“He would proudly wear the moniker of the face of the Resistance if it was bestowed on him by us, but we won’t do that. No man in the world of journalism has made a mockery of his profession quite like this man,” Bozell and Graham wrote.

MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” duo Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski share the second spot on the list of media members who clearly loathe the president. The married co-hosts were famously tight with Trump before eventually turning on him. They now criticize the president on a regular basis, but Scarborough had nothing but positive remarks about Trump’s D-Day speech.

Media companies have long griped about the Alphabet Inc. unit ’ s dominance of the digital advertising market , but few are as outspoken -- or as influential -- as Murdoch ’ s News Corp .
The company , which publishes the Wall Street Journal and the Times of London , among other papers , has complained to regulators around the world that Google is abusing its power in the $ 330 billion digital ad market and siphoning revenue that should be going to media companies .
The campaign has had its share of victories . The European Union has levied billions of dollars in fines against Google and Australia has moved to force the company to pay for news . But action in the U.S. , Google ’ s biggest market , has been elusive since enforcers closed an antitrust investigation seven years ago .
That ’ s about to change : The Justice Department , led by Attorney General William Barr , is preparing to file an antitrust lawsuit against the company , according to a person familiar with the matter . News Corp. representatives have met privately with the Justice Department about the investigation .
Last week , a trade group for news organizations that is chaired by a senior News Corp. executive published a research paper outlining how Google has leveraged its dominance to take publishers ’ content and drive traffic without compensating them under copyright laws . The trade group , the News Media Alliance , sent the report to the Justice Department .
When it comes to the power of America ’ s tech giants , President Donald Trump and Murdoch are on the same page . As News Corp. chases Google around the world with claims the company is abusing its dominance , Trump has repeatedly lashed out against the internet search giant and its tech peers , complaining last month that they are controlled by the “ Radical Left . ”
While Trump recently criticized Murdoch ’ s Fox News for “ doing nothing ” to help him get elected in November , the network features some of the president ’ s most strident defenders , particularly in the face of his biggest crises like the coronavirus outbreak and the nationwide protests that gripped U.S. cities in the wake of George Floyd ’ s death in Minneapolis .
News Corp. , the Justice Department and Google all declined to comment about News Corp. ’ s campaign . Google has previously said that advertisers and publishers have a lot of choices for the advertising technology they use and that competition is “ flourishing . ”
Since he took over the Justice Department in early 2019 , Barr has been Trump ’ s most reliable foot-soldier in the effort to corral Google and its big-tech rivals . He opened a broad inquiry into whether they are thwarting competition -- then took a hands-on role in shaping the investigation . Last fall , after the Justice Department had announced the investigation , Barr met with Murdoch in New York , according to the New York Times .
The attorney general tipped his hand at his January 2019 confirmation hearing when he said : “ I think a lot of people wonder how such huge behemoths that now exist in Silicon Valley have taken shape under the nose of the antitrust enforcers . ”
When he learned in May 2019 that Makan Delrahim , his antitrust chief , had agreed to open inquiries into Google and Apple Inc. while handing over Facebook Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. to the Federal Trade Commission , Barr was miffed , according to a person familiar with the matter . Two months later , the Justice Department announced wide-ranging reviews of the top social media , retail and search platforms , effectively grabbing authority over all four tech giants and doing an end-run around the agreement with the FTC .
Barr also assigned his No . 2 , Jeffrey Rosen , to oversee the probes . Rosen last fall brought on Ryan Shores , a seasoned antitrust litigator from Shearman & Sterling LLP , as a senior adviser in the tech company probes .
Barr , who clashed with tech companies over open-internet rules as general counsel at Verizon Communications Inc. and its predecessor from 1994 to 2008 , advocates reining in the liability shield the tech companies enjoy for content on their platforms , a protection Trump is also trying to undermine . Last week , Barr proposed a broad reform to that immunity .
A Justice Department lawsuit against Google could potentially do what Murdoch and other publishers have long sought : disrupt Google ’ s hold over the digital advertising market and the revenue that comes with it . While any case could take years to play out , it carries the risk of forcing Google to split off parts or all of its advertising business .
“ Publishers , particularly quality publishers that invest in content , haven ’ t believed the digital advertising ecosystem works for them for a long time , ” said David Chavern , the president of the News Media Alliance , which represents news organizations , including News Corp. “ The whole system is designed so you can ’ t follow the money . All we know is we ’ re not getting enough of it . ”
The risk is high for Google . In the last major monopoly case brought by the U.S. -- the 1998 lawsuit the Bill Clinton administration pursued against Microsoft Corp. -- a judge initially ordered the breakup of the software company . That decision was overturned on appeal in 2001 and the George W. Bush administration settled the matter in 2002 , with Microsoft agreeing to court supervision for nine years .
At issue for publishers is that Google owns much of the technology that delivers ads across the web , acting as the intermediary between advertisers and web publishers and collecting fees along the way in what is sometimes called the “ ad tech tax . ”
Publishers have little choice but to go through Google . Its technology acts as the gatekeeper to about 90 % of advertising space that websites sell using automated systems , according to a paper issued last month outlining how Google may be violating antitrust laws in the digital ad market . That figure excludes so-called walled gardens like Amazon and Facebook , which use their own ad technology .
“ The publishers are trying to monetize their content and they only have one choice in how to do that , which is Google , ” said Yale University economist Fiona Scott Morton , one of the paper ’ s authors . Publishers also compete against Google ’ s YouTube to sell ad space . When a company depends on its direct competitor for revenue , “ that ’ s a problem , ” she said .
The coronavirus outbreak has raised the stakes for publishers , which have been battered by a drop in advertising revenue , leading to layoffs , furloughs and pay cuts across the industry .
Among publishers , News Corp. has been one of the most vocal about that lack of choice and the costs publishers incur as a result . In addition to meeting with Justice Department officials about Google , News Corp. has also testified in Congress about the company ’ s power over digital advertising .
“ Dominant platforms take the overwhelming majority of advertising revenue without making any investment in the production of the news , ” David Pitofsky , News Corp. ’ s general counsel , told the House antitrust subcommittee last year . The panel is investigating Google , including its conduct in the digital advertising market , and other technology platforms . “ As a result , one of the pillars of the news industry ’ s business model , advertising revenue , is crumbling , ” he said .
State attorneys general are also preparing to file an antitrust lawsuit against Google . News Corp. has made several campaign donations to Republican state attorneys general who have been outspoken about Google , according to data compiled by the National Institute on Money in Politics , which tracks donations .
News Corp. ’ s political action committee donated $ 2,000 to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton less than two months before Paxton announced a multistate investigation into Google last year . It gave a total of $ 3,500 during 2018 and 2019 to Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry , who complained at a gathering of attorneys general last year that Google “ gets to pick the winners and losers because the system is rigged in their favor and rife with conflicts. ” Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes received $ 1,000 from News Corp. in February 2016 , less than a month after he called on the FTC to revisit its closed investigation of Google . News Corp. donated another $ 2,500 to Reyes in July 2018 , just as Republican attorneys general were speaking out about tech companies .
News Corp. has other ties to the states . Cristina Caffarra , an economist at consulting firm Charles River Associates who has worked for the company , is assisting Texas in its investigation of Google . Caffarra declined to comment on her role in the inquiry and Paxton , Reyes and Landry didn ’ t immediately respond to requests for comment on the donations .
One of the central disputes between Google and news publishers is how much of every advertising dollar actually ends up with publishers once it travels through Google ’ s technology , which facilitates the buying and selling of ad space between advertisers and websites .
In his House testimony , Pitofsky cited a test conducted by the Guardian newspaper in the U.K. that found just 30 cents of every dollar spent by an advertiser goes to the publisher , while the rest goes to the ad-tech infrastructure that delivers the ads . Pitofsky didn ’ t specifically identify Google as taking the other 70 cents .
Google says the opposite is true on the revenue split : Publishers receive about 70 % of what advertisers pay . In its most recent annual report , Google removed that estimate but says it ’ s still accurate . Google ’ s estimate is backed up by a 2019 report by research firm eMarketer , which found publishers receive about 67 % .
Other analysts have found different estimates . A study issued in May that PricewaterhouseCoopers conducted for British advertiser trade group ISBA found publishers received about half the money spent by advertisers . Of the other half , 34 % went to various fees and 15 % couldn ’ t be accounted for .
Chavern from the News Media Alliance said even without Fox ’ s support for Trump , Google would be battling antitrust scrutiny now that lawmakers in both parties are raising concerns about the dominance of America ’ s tech giants .
“ Murdoch gets outsized attention because he ’ s a person people know and he ’ s been willing to be vocal in a way that other people haven ’ t , but he ’ s not the only one who ’ s been complaining , ” he said .","Media mogul Rupert Murdoch is on the cusp of his biggest win yet in his war against Google: a Justice Department antitrust lawsuit against the internet giant.

And I think that in this era reporters have been thrust into a position where, you know, we are not only calling balls and strikes but we are calling fouls.""

Reid's story ended with Acosta complaining that Sarah Sanders is now taking questions in the driveway at the White House, and not as much in the briefing room, and defending his yelling one more time.

ACOSTA: I don't want that way of life to change for us, so yeah, it's worth fighting for. Yeah, it's worth shouting questions to make sure that they are held accountable on this sort of thing. I feel very strongly about it. I want my kids to grow up in a country where, you know, we can still shout questions at the president. he can take it. He's the president, right? He can handle it.

But could Acosta handle tough questions to hold him accountable? He wasn't really getting them on CBS.",www.newsbusters.org,right,8cdizApaJGLvhaXh

But the crusading privacy journalist has plenty of complimentary things to say about how the Fox prime-time host conducts herself on air.

“She has a lower tolerance for being fed incoherent tripe from her own side than the average cable news TV host,” Greenwald said in an email. “Most Fox and MSNBC hosts treat even the most blatant idiocy with respect if it advances their party’s political agenda for the vapid cable news partisan controversy of the day.

That’s high praise considering the source. But it’s in keeping with the raves that Kelly is winning less than a year since the debut of her solo show, “The Kelly File,” which airs at 9 p.m. weekdays.

Kelly’s career is red hot right now, and she’s achieved an unusual status for a host in the middle of the often-ideological cable new wars: Kelly’s earning respect across the political divide. She prods interview subjects whether they’re from the left or the right, at times treating them like hostile witnesses; her questions are pointed, and she’s quick to interrupt an answer that’s off point or meandering — no matter who it’s from.

Members of Congress who have been interviewed commend her lively style; competing producers praise the content on her show; even left-leaning journalists like Greenwald, among others, say they have to respect Kelly’s forceful challenges to the right; and former colleagues and media watchers say she’s just got that “X factor” — the mix of qualities that produce a cable news superstar.

His claim was in jest , but a former Facebook employee ’ s contention that the site ’ s “ news curators ” routinely omitted popular conservative news from its “ trending news ” feed has reignited a long-running debate about online news , media bias , and what political scientists say is a trend toward increasing political polarization .
For what 's increasingly a primary news source for its 1 billion daily users , Facebook could be a significant influence on what is considered true in a US election year .
In a report published Monday by the tech site Gizmodo , the employee alleged that news stories featured on Facebook were selected from a small pool of trusted news sources , such as The New York Times , the BBC , or the Guardian , at the exclusion of several others .
Facebook has denied the report , saying it doesn ’ t censor particular articles and enforces “ rigorous guidelines ” to bar reviewers from doing so .
“ I don ’ t know where that ’ s coming from , ” a Facebook spokesperson tells The ███ .
The company has faced questions about its influence on politics in the past – comments by chief executive Mark Zuckerberg aimed at Donald Trump led to speculation that the site would seek to influence the 2016 election , while a tweet from a Facebook board member that appeared to endorse colonialism in India became part of a movement to bar its Free Basics site from the country .
The allegations about the news curators , who were described by Gizmodo as a “ small group of young journalists , primarily educated at Ivy League or private East Coast universities ” – could further challenge the site ’ s longstanding claims of technological neutrality .
“ I was really surprised , ” says Jason Gainous , a professor of political science at the University of Louisville . “ I hadn ’ t even thought about that possibility . I know their algorithm filters out based on user preferences but the idea that they ’ re actually filtering out their trending stories , this is not good news for them . ”
If it is occurring , such filtering could potentially alter the views of conservative users , some say .
“ People tend to select information matching their political beliefs . If Facebook were systematically favoring one political perspective over another , then it would challenge this trend for those on one side of the political aisle , ” writes Natalie Jomini Stroud , an associate professor of communication at the University of Texas at Austin who directs the Engaging News Project , in an e-mail to the Monitor .
The former Facebook news curator ’ s claim , which was contested by other curators interviewed by Gizmodo and The Guardian , sparked a firestorm of criticism from some conservative news sites . But the growing polarization of our news consumption may not require help from social media . Instead , it may be an outgrowth of the manner in which we consume our news , experts say .
With trust in government peaking in the mid-1960s and a decline in belief in established information sources , including the news media , many Americans have increasingly become polarized in their political views and self-selected into like-minded communities , says Bill Bishop , a journalist and author of “ The Big Sort : Why the Clustering of Like-Minded America is Tearing Us Apart . ”
That `` clustering '' tendency may be further enabled by social networking sites , which continue to usurp broadcast news and newspapers as a key central destination for news . But there are some distinctions in how users seek out news online on different platforms .
A study from the Pew Research Center found that more than half of users of both Facebook and Twitter used the platforms as a news source for events beyond their friends and family .
But while Twitter is seen primarily as a tool for keeping up with breaking news and following their favorite outlets , reporters , and commentators , Facebook functions more as a forum . Its users were more likely to post and respond to content about government and politics .
Could trending news stories actually impact users ’ political views ? It ’ s still hard to tell .
“ There is research suggesting that those selecting like-minded partisan media hold more polarized political views . It ’ s not clear to me whether the ‘ Trending ’ feature would have the same effect , ” writes Stroud , the communication professor in Texas . `` What may be more likely is that the ‘ Trending ’ feature influences what issues people believe are most important , ” she says .
Accusations of bias could be worsened by the fact that Facebook ’ s news feeds are lightly tailored . The trending feed also has some differences from what users see on their personal news feed , the Facebook spokesperson says .
Trending topics are generated through what users are talking about on the site , then “ lightly curated ” by Facebook ’ s review team , the company 's spokesperson tells the Monitor .
“ Popular topics are first surfaced by an algorithm , then audited by review team members to confirm that the topics are in fact trending news in the real world and not , for example , similar-sounding topics or misnomers , ” writes Tom Stocky , Facebook ’ s vice president of search , in a post on the site on Monday .
Mr. Stocky also disputes a contention that the news curators artificially “ injected ” stories into the trending feed , including adding stories about the civil rights movement # BlackLivesMatter when they were not trending .
“ Facebook does not allow or advise our reviewers to systematically discriminate against sources of any ideological origin and we 've designed our tools to make that technically not feasible . At the same time , our reviewers ' actions are logged and reviewed , and violating our guidelines is a fireable offense , ” he writes .
Instead , Facebook has argued that the types of stories that people see on the site are based mostly on who users ’ friends are and what they share , not the site ’ s algorithm .
Using data from more than 10 million users , researchers from the company found the site ’ s algorithm reduces so-called cross-cutting material – or content that runs counter to a user ’ s own political views – by slightly less than 1 percent . A user ’ s own “ filter bubble ” of friends , by contrast , reduces such content by about 4 percent .
By design , Facebook encourages users to self-select , with political views playing a key role , says Mr. Bishop .
“ They ’ ve built a site that is profitable because it caters to people ’ s need to self-express and curate and refine their images and individual brands , and they do that within groups where they feel comfortable because everyone is like them . It ’ s the site for our time , ” he says .
Additionally , some users are making conscious decisions to attempt to influence what types of content will appear in their own news feeds .
Several “ folk theories ” – including a “ Narcissus Theory ” that users will see more from friends similar to them and a perspective that suggests Facebook is all powerful and unknowable – shaped how some users manipulated the site , says Karrie Karahalios , an associate professor of computer science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign .
Dr. Karahalios and several colleagues collected these folk theories together in a recently published paper by giving users access to an interface disclosing “ seams ” that provided hints into how Facebook ’ s algorithm works .

Increasing dominance of online news

That ""clustering"" tendency may be further enabled by social networking sites, which continue to usurp broadcast news and newspapers as a key central destination for news. But there are some distinctions in how users seek out news online on different platforms.

A study from the Pew Research Center found that more than half of users of both Facebook and Twitter used the platforms as a news source for events beyond their friends and family.

But while Twitter is seen primarily as a tool for keeping up with breaking news and following their favorite outlets, reporters, and commentators, Facebook functions more as a forum. Its users were more likely to post and respond to content about government and politics.

It’s not clear to me whether the ‘Trending’ feature would have the same effect,” writes Stroud, the communication professor in Texas. ""What may be more likely is that the ‘Trending’ feature influences what issues people believe are most important,” she says.

Gaming the news feed, or just personal preference?

Accusations of bias could be worsened by the fact that Facebook’s news feeds are lightly tailored. The trending feed also has some differences from what users see on their personal news feed, the Facebook spokesperson says.

Trending topics are generated through what users are talking about on the site, then “lightly curated” by Facebook’s review team, the company's spokesperson tells the Monitor.

“Popular topics are first surfaced by an algorithm, then audited by review team members to confirm that the topics are in fact trending news in the real world and not, for example, similar-sounding topics or misnomers,” writes Tom Stocky, Facebook’s vice president of search, in a post on the site on Monday.

Mr. Stocky also disputes a contention that the news curators artificially “injected” stories into the trending feed, including adding stories about the civil rights movement #BlackLivesMatter when they were not trending.

By design, Facebook encourages users to self-select, with political views playing a key role, says Mr. Bishop.

“They’ve built a site that is profitable because it caters to people’s need to self-express and curate and refine their images and individual brands, and they do that within groups where they feel comfortable because everyone is like them. It’s the site for our time,” he says.

Additionally, some users are making conscious decisions to attempt to influence what types of content will appear in their own news feeds.

Several “folk theories” – including a “Narcissus Theory” that users will see more from friends similar to them and a perspective that suggests Facebook is all powerful and unknowable – shaped how some users manipulated the site, says Karrie Karahalios, an associate professor of computer science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

Dr. Karahalios and several colleagues collected these folk theories together in a recently published paper by giving users access to an interface disclosing “seams” that provided hints into how Facebook’s algorithm works.

“We found that it got people thinking a little bit more and it got them to try things on Facebook that they wouldn’t have thought of before, they had a bit more knowledge and they had a tool set available to them that they could put action into their news feed,” she says.

The RNC sought to install more “conservatives in the moderator’s chair” because conservatives still are nursing grudges against some of the 2012 primary debate moderators. When ABC’s George Stephanopoulos pressed Mitt Romney on whether “states have the right to ban contraception,” conservatives blamed the “liberal media” for asking an irrelevant question. When CNN’s John King opened a debate by asking Newt Gingrich about allegations leveled by his ex-wife, Gingrich brought the crowd to its feet by chastising King and lambasting “the elite media protecting Barack Obama by attacking Republicans.”

At least in those instances, Republicans could try the “blame the media” strategy to limit the damage. This year, when Republicans shoot themselves in the foot on the debate stage, they won’t have that option.

The recent gaffes on Fox News by Republican candidates are not because Fox News journalists are suddenly out to get Republicans. It’s because even a softball question can trip up a candidate not ready for prime time. Megyn Kelly’s interview of Jeb Bush was the journalistic equivalent of a warm hug. Her simple Iraq question—“Knowing what we know now, would you have authorized the invasion?”—was only a couple of notches tougher than Katie Couric’s “What newspapers and magazines did you regularly read?”

After Jeb’s initial answer, which skipped past the hindsight premise, Kelly conversationally and neutrally asked for a clarification, “You don't think it was a mistake?” When Jeb was done, she breezily moved on to a new line of questioning well-suited for Fox: “Do you feel that America's place in the world has diminished under President Obama?”

But Fox News teased the Iraq clip before the full interview aired, sparking a media firestorm. Rivals Chris Christie and Ted Cruz, both fervent hawks, jumped in front of the microphone to proclaim they would not have invaded. Influential conservative radio talker Laura Ingraham was incredulous: “You have to have [a nominee] who says, ‘Look, I’m a Republican but I’m not an idiot … I learn from the past.’”

Trying to clean up his mess a couple of days later, Bush ran to what should have been safe ground, Fox News’ Sean Hannity. The host functioned less as a journalist than as a friend helping a friend in need. He first suggested “the media” interpreted Bush wrong and so “I wanted to see if I could clarify that.” After Bush failed to actually clarify, Hannity threw him a second lifeline, “So in other words, with 20/20 hindsight, you would make a different decision.” Bush whiffed the softball, saying, “I don’t know what that decision would have been.”

At a time when Americans needed credible information on what is literally a matter of life and death , the network and its right-wing media associates chose instead to propagandize their audiences .
Right-wing media had a particular responsibility to their audiences at that moment . Conservative leaders spent decades denouncing the press as perniciously liberal and standing up their own news outlets for their supporters to consume instead . The strategy worked : Rank-and-file Republicans came to deeply distrust mainstream news sources ; right-wing talk radio , Fox , and a variety of other outlets became profitable and influential businesses ; and the right gained immense political power .

By providing real information about the coming crisis and the steps their audience members could take to reduce it , they could have saved lives .
But the most powerful members of the right-wing media didn ’ t step up . Instead , they worked to counteract increasing public concern about coronavirus and defend Trump ’ s response . Limbaugh repeatedly compared COVID-19 to the common cold and denounced efforts to curtail its spread such as quarantines . He said “ the American left , the Democrat Party , the media ” are just trying to control people , and that these efforts are “ made-to-order for [ their ] objectives. ” Hannity said that people raising concerns about the disease were trying to “ bludgeon Trump with this new hoax. ” Numerous Fox personalities claimed that , in the words of the network ’ s medical correspondent , the “ worst case scenario ” for coronavirus is that “ it could be the flu. ” Fox Business host Trish Regan described Democrats as using coronavirus as “ yet another attempt to impeach the president ” ( she subsequently lost her show ) . These arguments were made over and over again by people who had unique credibility among conservatives .
Those on the right who did take the disease seriously were fighting against the tide .
Worst of all , Trump himself was caught up in -- and fed -- the propaganda effort , creating a sinister feedback loop to play down the virus ’ s risks . Fox in particular is stocked with sometime-presidential advisers who have tremendous influence on public affairs because Trump watches their shows . If that Fox Cabinet had taken coronavirus seriously from its earliest days , perhaps they could have gotten Trump to take it seriously as well . They didn ’ t . Now the country is struggling to catch up to the disease , and polls show Republicans are much less likely to be treating it as an issue of concern . Conservative media owed their audience better than this .
Now , with the virus on the verge of extracting a terrible toll on the American public , the tone in the right-wing media is shifting . But don ’ t expect the rising concern to bring with it soul-searching about what conservative media outlets did in the early days of the pandemic .
“ A reporter asked me today why conservatives were initially so skeptical of the threat of the coronavirus , ” former House Speaker and Fox contributor Newt Gingrich tweeted Monday . “ One of the dangerous consequences of having a totally dishonest left wing news media was that most Americans discounted their hysteria as phony . ”
For Trumpian conservatives , everything is the media ’ s fault , even the failures of the edifice they set up to displace it .","It is good that Fox personalities appear to finally recognize the gravity of the situation.

He said “the American left, the Democrat Party, the media” are just trying to control people, and that these efforts are “made-to-order for [their] objectives.” Hannity said that people raising concerns about the disease were trying to “bludgeon Trump with this new hoax.” Numerous Fox personalities claimed that, in the words of the network’s medical correspondent, the “worst case scenario” for coronavirus is that “it could be the flu.” Fox Business host Trish Regan described Democrats as using coronavirus as “yet another attempt to impeach the president” (she subsequently lost her show). These arguments were made over and over again by people who had unique credibility among conservatives.

Those on the right who did take the disease seriously were fighting against the tide.

Worst of all, Trump himself was caught up in -- and fed -- the propaganda effort, creating a sinister feedback loop to play down the virus’s risks. Fox in particular is stocked with sometime-presidential advisers who have tremendous influence on public affairs because Trump watches their shows. If that Fox Cabinet had taken coronavirus seriously from its earliest days, perhaps they could have gotten Trump to take it seriously as well. They didn’t. Now the country is struggling to catch up to the disease, and polls show Republicans are much less likely to be treating it as an issue of concern. Conservative media owed their audience better than this.

Now, with the virus on the verge of extracting a terrible toll on the American public, the tone in the right-wing media is shifting. But don’t expect the rising concern to bring with it soul-searching about what conservative media outlets did in the early days of the pandemic.

“A reporter asked me today why conservatives were initially so skeptical of the threat of the coronavirus,” former House Speaker and Fox contributor Newt Gingrich tweeted Monday. “One of the dangerous consequences of having a totally dishonest left wing news media was that most Americans discounted their hysteria as phony.”

For Trumpian conservatives, everything is the media’s fault, even the failures of the edifice they set up to displace it.",www.mediamatters.org,left,Cvc7NdPJafOlXa3r

Jack Shafer is Politico’s senior media writer.

In recent months, New York Times readers brave enough to open the paper’s op-ed pages have been staggered to find opinions there. Yes, opinions!

The initial shock came in April, when Bret Stephens, a refugee from the Wall Street Journal opinion pages, took up residence at the Times, bringing with him his contrarian views on climate change. The Guardian spoke for injured readers everywhere with a piece headlined “NY Times Hired a Hippie Puncher to Give Climate Obstructionists Cover.” The inevitable Change.org petition calling for Stephens’ sacking went up, gathering tens of thousands of signatures, and Times reporters and editors savaged him on Twitter. Compounding the grievance was Michael Kinsley’s opinion series “Say Something Nice About Donald Trump,” which elicited angry letters to the editor and ridicule from Newsweek, Fusion (now Splinter) and, of course, Twitter. (Disclosure: Kinsley was my boss more than a decade ago.)

Story Continued Below

Over the summer, umbrage fever spread to conservatives exposed to the “Red Century” series, the paper’s continuing op-ed exploration of “the history and legacy of Communism, 100 years after the Russian Revolution.” Why is the Times rehabilitating Communism, one Federalist writer asked, instead of dealing “forthrightly with the horrors of the Soviet regime”? Another Federalist writer called “Red Century” a “bizarre nostalgia series about communist dictatorships.” Among the stories the Federalist took exception to were “Why Women Had Better Sex Under Socialism,” “Thanks to Mom, the Marxist Revolutionary” and “When Communism Inspired Americans.” “The ghost of Walter Duranty still lives at the New York Times,” the Federalist’s Inez Feltscher wrote.

It was the left’s turn to cry this week, as the page published an op-ed by Erik Prince, the founder of the Blackwater mercenary army and Betsy DeVos’ brother. Prince proposed a potentially self-dealing solution to the Afghanistan stalemate: A mercenary army of about 6,000 to assist an American Special Operations force of 2,000. The New Republic disparaged the piece as a Prince sales pitch. Huffington Post Editor in Chief Lydia Polgreen tweeted, “Unbowed, a newspaper continues to flog its lousy opinion piece.” Also taking exception to the Times’ editorial judgment were writers at Slate and GQ. New York magazine took the easy route, scraping Twitter for the inevitable parody headlines.

As susceptible as the next guy to hating the Times for running pieces I disagree with, I used as kindling to start a trash fire the recent Times page in which K-Sue Park informed the ACLU it needed to rethink free speech. Then, guided by a 2010 article about the history of the Times op-ed page written by University of Maine professor of journalism Michael Socolow, I returned to my senses. His deeply researched piece, “A Profitable Public Sphere: The Creation of the New York Times Op-Ed Page,” demonstrates that from the time its top editors started thinking about adding an op-ed section in the early 1960s, the whole idea was to trigger reader insurrections with outrageous views.

Before the Times op-ed page debuted on Sept. 21, 1970, obituaries occupied the page opposite the editorials. John B. Oakes, the Times editor who almost willed the page into existence, believed that a newspaper’s “deepest responsibility” was to make readers think. “The minute we begin to insist that everyone think the same way we think, our democratic way of life is in danger,” he said in a 1954 speech.

As the Times op-ed page took shape, its editors assembled a list of prospective authors and subjects they could address. One list, preserved in the Harrison Salisbury Papers at Columbia University, proposes soliciting pieces from Communist Party USA head Gus Hall, John Bircher Society leader Robert Welch, oil man and right-winger H.L. Hunt, labor radical Harry Bridges and revolutionary Angela Davis. The page’s concept was to express ideas and opinions the reader couldn’t find on the editorial page or elsewhere in the newspaper. The range and ambition of the page were such that one of the early editors on the page, John Van Doorn, tried (and failed) to hire Tupac Shakur’s mother, Afeni Shakur, as an editor in 1971, as Socolow writes elsewhere.

In an invitation to novelist Walker Percy to write for the section, Times editor Herbert Mitgang made explicit the page’s appetite for the notorious. “The most successful pieces have been highly individualistic, opinionated, and pungent,” Mitgang wrote. “[Y]ou will not get arrested if the piece is also witty.” Noam Chomsky, who took an assignment, filed a way-overlong draft and resisted all efforts to cut it before withdrawing the piece. “For some reason, I find it enormously more difficult to write 700 words than 7,000—a typical professorial defect, I suppose,” Chomsky wrote.

Even before the page got started, the paper was making outré assignments. In the early months of 1970, it asked General Curtis LeMay, an ultra-hawk, to write on the role of the Air Force in Vietnam and “whether it should be doing more, less, or something different to expedite the war.” (He didn’t.) A couple of months before the formal op-ed page got started, Vice President Spiro T.

MERRILL BROWN: There is no evidence to support the assertion that serious-minded straight-forward breaking news coverage on television will either produce good television or numbers.

FOLKENFLIK: Brown helped to create Court TV and was a top executive at MSNBC's start.

BROWN: All of these folks have tried breaking news and unless there's a plane going down, an election coming, or a celebrity trial, you don't see mass numbers of people coming to cable news.

FOLKENFLIK: Brown predicts even well-financed corporate chiefs in Doha will want competitive ratings and will ultimately cut a huge check to hire a big-name anchor such as Diane Sawyer. But anchor Joie Chen, formerly of CBS and CNN, says that's not in the DNA of this new organization.

JOIE CHEN: We are a platform for stories and storytellers and storytelling. We are not a platform for stars and celebrities.

FOLKENFLIK: When CNN founder Ted Turner essentially invented cable news, he said the news was the star. More than three decades later, Al Jazeera America is betting a lot of money he was right. David Folkenflik, NPR News.

She challenged Ryan 's arguments that the bill 's tax cuts will encourage investment by businesses and wo n't explode the deficit .
Independent analyses , however , have found that the cuts will largely benefit corporations and wealthy Americans .
The `` Today '' show host Savannah Guthrie did n't mince words Wednesday in challenging House Speaker Paul Ryan 's argument that the GOP tax bill will spur enough economic growth to make up for an explosion in the deficit .
Guthrie told Ryan that many CEOs have said they do n't plan to use money saved from tax cuts to reinvest in their businesses , create jobs , and raise workers ' wages , contrary to what the GOP has touted as effects of the bill , expected to be enacted as soon as Wednesday after a final vote in the House .
Instead , she said , they 'll `` do stock buybacks '' and `` line the pockets of shareholders . ''
Guthrie quoted Michael Bloomberg , the billionaire businessman and former New York City mayor who wrote in an op-ed last week that it was `` pure fantasy to think that the tax bill will lead to significantly higher wages and growth . ''
She then asked Ryan , `` Are you living in a fantasy world ? ''
Ryan , who has long advocated deep cuts to taxes and government spending , responded by citing surveys of business owners — the vast majority of whom , he argued , would do `` just what we say : reinvest in their workers , reinvest in their factories , pay people more money , higher wages . ''
`` The data is really clear , '' Ryan said , adding that `` it 's not a question of if , it 's a question of how much '' workers will benefit from the bill 's cutting the corporate tax rate to 21 % from the current 35 % .
Guthrie then played a clip of Gary Cohn , the former Goldman Sachs executive who now heads the National Economic Council , at a conference last month with CEOs , who were asked whether they 'd increase investments in their businesses as a result of the GOP tax bill .
Just a smattering of the CEOs ' hands went up , leaving Cohn to awkwardly ask , `` Why are n't the other hands up ? ''
Guthrie told Ryan on Wednesday : `` The fact of the matter is corporations are already sitting on a ton of cash . They have record profits : $ 2.3 trillion . Why are n't they raising wages and creating jobs now ? ''
Ryan responded that much of this cash was currently `` trapped overseas and can not come back into our economy to be reinvested because of our tax laws . ''
`` We know that if we fix these tax laws we will get reinvestment back in this economy , '' he said . `` Every study under the sun shows us : You lower the tax rates , make us more competitive , you will see faster economic growth in America . ''
But in 2004 , when a so-called tax holiday most recently occurred , roughly 80 % of the cash brought back into the US went to fund stock buybacks . The vast majority — 65 % — of respondents to a recent Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey of 302 US companies said that they would pay down debt with the money they would save or repatriate under the tax bill .
Forty-six percent of respondents said at least a portion of the repatriated money would be spent on stock buybacks , which help achieve immediate share appreciation and signal to investors that a company views its stock as undervalued . Just 35 % said they would spend the money on capital expenditures , or investments in their businesses .
Guthrie also challenged Ryan , whom she described as `` a longtime budget hawk , '' to defend the nearly $ 1.5 trillion that independent analyses have found the GOP tax cuts will add to the deficit over the next decade .
But when Guthrie asked whether the economic growth that the GOP says the tax cuts will create would make up for the loss in the government 's tax revenue , Ryan said that was impossible to predict .
`` Nobody knows the answer to that question because that 's in the future , '' Ryan said . `` But what we do know is that this will increase economic growth . ''

Yet , when asked how their news media are doing on reporting different political issues fairly , people are far more mixed in their sentiments , with many saying their media do not deliver . And , in many countries , there are sharp political differences in views of the media – with the largest gap among Americans .
To build off ███ ’ s earlier findings about U.S. news media habits and attitudes , this new cross-national survey begins to study these dynamics globally . The survey finds that a median of 75 % across 38 countries say it is never acceptable for a news organization to favor one political party over others when reporting the news . Just 20 % say this is sometimes okay . People in Europe show the greatest opposition to political bias in their news , including 89 % in Spain and 88 % in Greece who think this is unacceptable . In the United States , 78 % say the news media should never favor one political party over another . In only five countries do at least three-in-ten believe it is okay to favor one side .
What is a median ? Throughout this report , median percentages are used to help readers see overall patterns . The median is the middle number in a list of figures sorted in ascending or descending order . In a survey of 38 countries , the median result is the average of the 19th and 20th figures on a list of country-level findings ranked in order .
In addition to medians of respondents across the survey ’ s 38 countries , this report sometimes refers to the median among a specific subset of respondents and/or countries by region or economic grouping . For example , we can look at a median across the seven Asian-Pacific countries , where the median is the fourth figure when the countries are listed from highest to lowest . We can also calculate the medians across 10 European nations , five Middle East-North African nations , six sub-Saharan African nations and seven Latin American nations .
While publics around the globe place a premium on politically unbiased news media , this is precisely the performance area , among four asked about , where publics are least likely to say their news media are doing well . A median of only 52 % across the 38 nations polled say the news media in their country do a good job of reporting on political issues fairly , while 44 % say they do not . And although majorities of the public in 18 countries say their news media are performing well in this area , attitudes are more negative in the remaining 20 nations surveyed . The most critical are Spain , Greece , South Korea , Lebanon and Chile , where at least six-in-ten say their news media do not do well on reporting the news fairly .
News media receive considerably higher marks in other performance areas . Broad majorities say their news media do a good job of covering the most important stories ( median of 73 % ) , reporting the news accurately ( 62 % ) , and reporting news about government leaders and officials ( 59 % ) . People in sub-Saharan Africa and the Asia-Pacific are more satisfied with their news media , while Latin Americans are the most critical . The U.S. public tends to fall roughly in the middle across the different performance areas asked about .
News media rated highest for covering important issues , lowest for reporting on politics fairly
Within countries , political identification tends to be the strongest divider of media attitudes , more so than education , age or gender .
Political party systems vary considerably across countries , but one consistent measure for comparing political divides is support for the governing party or parties . Individuals who identify with the governing party or parties are categorized as supporters , everyone else as nonsupporters . In the U.S. , this means that people who identify with the Republican Party , which currently controls all branches of the federal government , are considered governing party supporters . People who identify with the Democratic Party , say they are independent , identify with some other party or do not identify with any political party are categorized as nonsupporters . ( For more details on the categorization , please see Appendix B . )
Using this approach , large gaps in ratings of the media emerge between governing party supporters and nonsupporters . On the question of whether their news media cover political issues fairly , for example , partisan differences appear in 20 of the 38 countries surveyed . In five countries , the gap is at least 20 percentage points , with the largest by far in the U.S. at 34 percentage points . The next highest partisan gap is in Israel , with a 26-point difference .
The U.S. is also one of only a few countries where governing party supporters are less satisfied with their news media than are nonsupporters . In most countries , people who support the political party currently in power are more satisfied with the performance of their news media than those who do not support the governing party . For example , in Sweden , the Social Democratic Party and the Green Party are the two parties that currently form the governing coalition in the country . About eight-in-ten Swedes ( 82 % ) who identify with these two parties say their news media do a good job of covering political issues fairly . Just 58 % of Swedes who do not identify with these two parties agree .
The partisan gaps found in the survey indicate that , rather than being consistently tied to a particular ideological position , satisfaction with the news media across the globe is more closely related to support for the party in power – whether that party is left or right . Public satisfaction with the news media also links closely to trust in one ’ s national government and a sense that the economy is doing well , which reinforces the point that , for most countries surveyed here , satisfaction with the media aligns with satisfaction on other country conditions rather than along a left-right spectrum .
These are among the major findings of a ███ survey conducted among 41,953 respondents in 38 countries from Feb. 16 to May 8 , 2017 . In addition to the topics discussed above , the study also focuses on individuals ’ use of the internet and social media to get news , as well as the types of news people follow .
Online news is making inroads in many countries around the world
Digital technology is influencing news habits across the globe , though its use is still far from universal . Overall , a median of 42 % among the 38 countries surveyed say they get news on the internet at least once a day . In 14 countries , half or more adults get news online daily .
In general , internet access has been shown to be higher in wealthier countries , and this plays out to a greater likelihood of using the internet for news as well . For example , 61 % in Australia – which had a 2015 gross domestic product ( GDP ) per capita of $ 46,271 – get news at least once a day through the internet . Just 20 % in Senegal , with a GDP per capita of $ 2,421 , do the same .
The survey also asked a separate question about how often people get news specifically on social media sites . Unlike getting news on the internet generally , the percentage that gets news on social media is not strongly related to country wealth . In fact , the median percentages of people who get news at least once a day through social media are about the same in emerging and developing economies as in advanced ones ( 33 % and 36 % , respectively ) . Overall , a global median of 35 % get news daily through social media , with the highest levels in South Korea ( 57 % ) , Lebanon ( 52 % ) and Argentina ( 51 % ) .
What are advanced , emerging and developing countries ? For this report , we grouped countries into three economic categories : “ advanced , ” “ emerging ” and “ developing. ” In creating our economic classification of the countries in this report , we relied on multiple sources and criteria . Specifically , we were guided by : World Bank income classifications ; classifications of emerging markets by other multinational organizations , such as the International Monetary Fund ; per capita gross domestic product ( GDP ) ; total size of the country ’ s economy , as measured by GDP ; and average GDP growth between 2010 and 2015 . For more information , see Appendix C .
Public is highly engaged with news , but more so with news that ’ s close to home
Overall interest in the news has implications for how news media landscapes develop alongside technological change . Large majorities around the world say they follow national and local news closely ( global medians of 86 % and 78 % respectively ) . In all 38 countries , more than two-thirds say this of news about their own country . The same is true of news about their city or town in 32 countries .
People are much less interested in news about other countries ( global median of 57 % ) . In only six countries do more than two-thirds say they pay close attention to news about the rest of the world . People outside of the U.S. express a similarly low level of interest in news specifically about the U.S. ( 48 % ) .
Young more likely to get news online ; older people more likely to follow the news overall
Across all 38 countries , young people – those ages 18 to 29 – are more likely to get news online than adults 50 and older . In 11 countries , the age gap is 35 percentage points or greater .
At the same time , older people tend to be more interested in the various types of news asked about than the younger generation . The biggest gaps are in news about one ’ s own city or town . In 20 countries , people ages 50 and older are significantly more likely than people younger than 30 to closely follow local news . The age gap is at least 15 percentage points in 11 of the countries . Only in the Philippines and Brazil is the pattern reversed ; there , young people are more likely to follow local news .
For international news , age is less of a factor . In general , men and those with more education are more likely to follow international news .","Publics around the world overwhelmingly agree that the news media should be unbiased in their coverage of political issues, according to a new Pew Research Center survey of 38 countries. Yet, when asked how their news media are doing on reporting different political issues fairly, people are far more mixed in their sentiments, with many saying their media do not deliver. And, in many countries, there are sharp political differences in views of the media – with the largest gap among Americans.

To build off Pew Research Center’s earlier findings about U.S. news media habits and attitudes, this new cross-national survey begins to study these dynamics globally. The survey finds that a median of 75% across 38 countries say it is never acceptable for a news organization to favor one political party over others when reporting the news. Just 20% say this is sometimes okay. People in Europe show the greatest opposition to political bias in their news, including 89% in Spain and 88% in Greece who think this is unacceptable. In the United States, 78% say the news media should never favor one political party over another. In only five countries do at least three-in-ten believe it is okay to favor one side.

What is a median? Throughout this report, median percentages are used to help readers see overall patterns. The median is the middle number in a list of figures sorted in ascending or descending order. In a survey of 38 countries, the median result is the average of the 19th and 20th figures on a list of country-level findings ranked in order.

In addition to medians of respondents across the survey’s 38 countries, this report sometimes refers to the median among a specific subset of respondents and/or countries by region or economic grouping. For example, we can look at a median across the seven Asian-Pacific countries, where the median is the fourth figure when the countries are listed from highest to lowest. We can also calculate the medians across 10 European nations, five Middle East-North African nations, six sub-Saharan African nations and seven Latin American nations.

While publics around the globe place a premium on politically unbiased news media, this is precisely the performance area, among four asked about, where publics are least likely to say their news media are doing well. A median of only 52% across the 38 nations polled say the news media in their country do a good job of reporting on political issues fairly, while 44% say they do not. And although majorities of the public in 18 countries say their news media are performing well in this area, attitudes are more negative in the remaining 20 nations surveyed. The most critical are Spain, Greece, South Korea, Lebanon and Chile, where at least six-in-ten say their news media do not do well on reporting the news fairly.

News media receive considerably higher marks in other performance areas. Broad majorities say their news media do a good job of covering the most important stories (median of 73%), reporting the news accurately (62%), and reporting news about government leaders and officials (59%). People in sub-Saharan Africa and the Asia-Pacific are more satisfied with their news media, while Latin Americans are the most critical. The U.S. public tends to fall roughly in the middle across the different performance areas asked about.

News media rated highest for covering important issues, lowest for reporting on politics fairly

Within countries, political identification tends to be the strongest divider of media attitudes, more so than education, age or gender.

Political party systems vary considerably across countries, but one consistent measure for comparing political divides is support for the governing party or parties. Individuals who identify with the governing party or parties are categorized as supporters, everyone else as nonsupporters. In the U.S., this means that people who identify with the Republican Party, which currently controls all branches of the federal government, are considered governing party supporters. People who identify with the Democratic Party, say they are independent, identify with some other party or do not identify with any political party are categorized as nonsupporters. (For more details on the categorization, please see Appendix B.)

Using this approach, large gaps in ratings of the media emerge between governing party supporters and nonsupporters. On the question of whether their news media cover political issues fairly, for example, partisan differences appear in 20 of the 38 countries surveyed. In five countries, the gap is at least 20 percentage points, with the largest by far in the U.S. at 34 percentage points. The next highest partisan gap is in Israel, with a 26-point difference.

The U.S. is also one of only a few countries where governing party supporters are less satisfied with their news media than are nonsupporters. In most countries, people who support the political party currently in power are more satisfied with the performance of their news media than those who do not support the governing party. For example, in Sweden, the Social Democratic Party and the Green Party are the two parties that currently form the governing coalition in the country. About eight-in-ten Swedes (82%) who identify with these two parties say their news media do a good job of covering political issues fairly. Just 58% of Swedes who do not identify with these two parties agree.

The partisan gaps found in the survey indicate that, rather than being consistently tied to a particular ideological position, satisfaction with the news media across the globe is more closely related to support for the party in power – whether that party is left or right. Public satisfaction with the news media also links closely to trust in one’s national government and a sense that the economy is doing well, which reinforces the point that, for most countries surveyed here, satisfaction with the media aligns with satisfaction on other country conditions rather than along a left-right spectrum.

These are among the major findings of a Pew Research Center survey conducted among 41,953 respondents in 38 countries from Feb. 16 to May 8, 2017. In addition to the topics discussed above, the study also focuses on individuals’ use of the internet and social media to get news, as well as the types of news people follow.

Public is highly engaged with news, but more so with news that’s close to home

Overall interest in the news has implications for how news media landscapes develop alongside technological change. Large majorities around the world say they follow national and local news closely (global medians of 86% and 78% respectively). In all 38 countries, more than two-thirds say this of news about their own country. The same is true of news about their city or town in 32 countries.

People are much less interested in news about other countries (global median of 57%). In only six countries do more than two-thirds say they pay close attention to news about the rest of the world.

Wolf Blizter: The texts between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, they are so damning. David Chalian: They are Wolf which is why-what Gloria’s laying out here-yes that is Strzok’s mission today-is try to walk this line of “I have personal political views. It didn’t impact my work at all.” That may be true, but when he says that those texts “not indicative of bias”-that’s just flat wrong on its face. It is indicative of bias.

He did not follow that rule, and so now he’s in this position. Gloria’s right to note that he remains defiant. He has not apologized in any way for this behavior or expressing these things. He’s just trying to make this case, but I think it’s a tough case for him to make because of the simple nature of those texts.

The reasons for that are unclear . “ I suspect that part of it has to do with the rise of constant 24-hour news , ” Mr. Westwood said , “ and also the shift that we ’ ve unfortunately gone through in which elections are more or less now a permanent state of affairs . ”
To find out more about the consequences of that polarization , Mr. Westwood , along with Shanto Iyengar , a Stanford professor who studies political communication , embarked on a series of experiments . They found something quite shocking : Not only did party identity turn out to affect people ’ s behavior and decision making broadly , even on apolitical subjects , but according to their data it also had more influence on the way Americans behaved than race did .
That is a sea change in the role of partisanship in public life , Mr. Westwood said .
“ Partisanship , for a long period of time , wasn ’ t viewed as part of who we are , ” he said . “ It wasn ’ t core to our identity . It was just an ancillary trait . But in the modern era we view party identity as something akin to gender , ethnicity or race — the core traits that we use to describe ourselves to others . ”
That has made the personal political . “ Politics has become so important that people select relationships on that basis , ” Mr. Iyengar said . For instance , it has become quite rare for Democrats to marry Republicans , according to the same Westwood/Iyengar paper , which cited a finding in a 2009 survey of married couples that only 9 percent consisted of Democrat-Republican pairs . And it has become more rare for children to have a different party affiliation from their parents .
But it has also made the political personal . Today , political parties are no longer just the people who are supposed to govern the way you want . They are a team to support , and a tribe to feel a part of . And the public ’ s view of politics is becoming more and more zero-sum : It ’ s about helping their team win , and making sure the other team loses .
Partisan tribalism makes people more inclined to seek out and believe stories that justify their pre-existing partisan biases , whether or not they are true .
“ If I ’ m a rabid Trump voter and I don ’ t know much about public affairs , and I see something about some scandal about Hillary Clinton ’ s aides being involved in an assassination attempt , or that story about the pope endorsing Trump , then I ’ d be inclined to believe it , ” Mr. Iyengar said . “ This is reinforcing my beliefs about the value of a Trump candidacy . ”","Since then, that polarization has grown even stronger. The reasons for that are unclear. “I suspect that part of it has to do with the rise of constant 24-hour news,” Mr. Westwood said, “and also the shift that we’ve unfortunately gone through in which elections are more or less now a permanent state of affairs.”

“Partisanship, for a long period of time, wasn’t viewed as part of who we are,” he said. “It wasn’t core to our identity. It was just an ancillary trait. But in the modern era we view party identity as something akin to gender, ethnicity or race — the core traits that we use to describe ourselves to others.”

That has made the personal political. “Politics has become so important that people select relationships on that basis,” Mr. Iyengar said. For instance, it has become quite rare for Democrats to marry Republicans, according to the same Westwood/Iyengar paper, which cited a finding in a 2009 survey of married couples that only 9 percent consisted of Democrat-Republican pairs. And it has become more rare for children to have a different party affiliation from their parents.

But it has also made the political personal. Today, political parties are no longer just the people who are supposed to govern the way you want. They are a team to support, and a tribe to feel a part of. And the public’s view of politics is becoming more and more zero-sum: It’s about helping their team win, and making sure the other team loses.

How partisan bias fuels fake news

Partisan tribalism makes people more inclined to seek out and believe stories that justify their pre-existing partisan biases, whether or not they are true.

“If I’m a rabid Trump voter and I don’t know much about public affairs, and I see something about some scandal about Hillary Clinton’s aides being involved in an assassination attempt, or that story about the pope endorsing Trump, then I’d be inclined to believe it,” Mr. Iyengar said. “This is reinforcing my beliefs about the value of a Trump candidacy.”",www.nytimes.com,left,LkVrBoI8CqZnpPUB

According to the hacked Podesta emails, Brazile had tipped the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign about questions that would be asked in the primary debates, giving one of her incriminating emails the subject head, “From time to time I get the questions in advance.” In another email, she gave a sneak peek of a question that would be asked by a Flint “woman with a rash,” and would inquire of Clinton what she would do for Flint as president.

What Brazile did was wrong. Although CNN hired her to advance and defend the Democratic Party’s case in the endless hours of news talk the cable networks air, nothing can justify directly screwing one of the interests she collects pay from—CNN—in the process. She didn’t reduce the primary debates to a shambles, but she did violate an implied oath that the partisanship that got her the gig in the first place would not include such open-and-shut chicanery. Shame on Brazile. May she never suit up for paid verbal combat in the green room again.

TV hires these people and their ilk not for their spellbinding political insights but because they’re known quantities who will provide safe and predictable idle talk. By dividing their partisan contributors between Republicans and Democrats, TV creates the illusion of impartiality and inclusion. The contributors take the job because it’s easy—anybody can fill the air with platitudes and generalization, and all that face-time makes them more marketable on the lecture circuit. Working as a paid pundit is such a good deal, the contributors tend to conform to the expectations of the producers putting on the show. They hit their marks, fill the dead spaces with palaver, keep the commercials from bumping into one another, and sit at attention until called on—or interrupt should the show stall.

Not every TV contributor moment is a complete botch. Most of these people, with the exception of Lewandowski, know something about politics. Much more than you do. Much, much more than I do. But it’s not in, say, David Axelrod’s interests to share a damaging insight about Barack Obama, the horse he rode to prominence on. Almost to a one, the contributors pull punches and dilute the political conversation to the weakest of teas so the people in the bar and riding the elliptical trainers at the gym don’t have to strain to follow the Punch and Judy of it all.

What transpires during the paid contributor segments isn’t journalism. It isn’t politics. And it’s rarely even entertaining. I’d call it the worst sort of tasteless soy filler, only that would be an insult to soy, which is nutritious. There’s no reason outside of pragmatism that justifies their continued employment on the news shows.

Instead of deploying political hacks, the news shows would be smarter to hire journalists whose job it would be to extract meaningful information from the political hacks. Under my scheme, the Braziles and Carvilles and Palins could still be interviewed on TV, but they couldn’t draw pay—and they’d have to have something worthy to say or accept having the camera cut away from them.

Donna Brazile is probably sipping a cocktail tonight somewhere in Washington, wondering what hit her. CNN hired her to be a partisan, although not as much as her real employer, and what can be more partisan than leaking valuable political intelligence to help your side?

CHICAGO — It's come to this.

A transportation reporter for the Associated Press was told by federal government sources that they would be fired if they provided information to the journalist, AP Washington Bureau Chief Sally Buzbee says.

Not for turning over classified information a la Edward Snowden. Not for giving up the innermost secrets of the CIA or the NSA.

For furnishing information about the oh-so-sensitive world of transportation.

It's been clear for some time that the Obama administration has a terrible record when it comes to transparency. (Never mind that candidate Barack Obama vowed his would be the most transparent administration ever.)

But a couple of panel discussions Wednesday at the joint convention of the American Society of News Editors and Associated Press Media Editors suggest things are worse than we knew and doing nothing but getting more awful.

Equally alarming, Team Obama seems to have written a road map that others are eagerly following. The information spigot is increasingly being turned off by state and local governments, universities and sports teams, according to journalists who spoke Wednesday as well as ASNE legal counsel Kevin Goldberg, who says the problem goes all the way down to high schools. ""There is a concerted effort,"" he says.

This isn't simply inside baseball for frustrated journalists. It's a serious problem for the American people when they can't find out what their government is doing and must depend on propaganda-style government handouts, in which everything is rosy and not a discouraging word is heard.

It's widely agreed by journalists who cover the Obama administration that it has the worst record of all time when it comes to freedom of information. ""There is a serious problem with access across the federal government,"" Buzbee says, adding that the situation has ""worsened significantly in the last few years.""

Says AP Executive Editor Kathleen Carroll, ""(President George W.) Bush was bad. Obama's worse.""

REM RIEDER: An important crusade for open government

The problems go far beyond gagged transportation sources. Buzbee has a long list of infractions, including: few opportunities to take photographs or video of Obama appearances (the administration likes to distribute its own); no photos or video of bombers taking off for sorties against the Islamic State and no embedded journalists on hand; a massive blackout on information about Guantanamo; unprecedented ferocity in prosecuting national security leaks designed to intimidate journalists and chill sources.

And the get-tough approach is having an impact. ""It's harder to get sources to believe that we can protect them,"" says AP senior managing editor Mike Oreskes.

But the information crisis has spread far beyond the Beltway, says AP Managing Editor for U.S. News Brian Carovillano, infecting state and local governments and institutions of higher learning. ""It's the most difficult climate we've seen,"" he says.

Carovillano points to New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who also ran as a big transparency guy, then tried unsuccessfully to have his swearing-in closed to the press. But, says Carovillano, Hizzoner has since barred the media from 53 events, and on some days his entire schedule is off-limits.

And there is no limit to the absurdity. Outgoing ASNE President David Boardman, the former Seattle Times editor who is now dean of the Temple University School of Media and Communication, recalls a time when the University of Washington wanted to limit the number of tweets at sporting events.

So what's the answer? The news media have to battle back on every front. They should refuse to run government photos and video. Reporters should constantly push back as hard as they can. News outlets should be ready to challenge unreasonable restraint in court. And the industry must band together in a full-fledged campaign against government secrecy.

And they must do their best to educate the people about why this is their problem. Because the American public — and American democracy — are the losers when the electorate can't get the information it needs to make informed decisions.

REM RIEDER: Don't make reporter testify against a source

Oh, and one more thing, says New York Times reporter James Risen, the convention's keynote speaker, who faces jail time for refusing to ID a confidential source: The best idea is to do even more hard-edged investigative reporting, to find out more things the government doesn't want you to know. That, he said, would amount to a ""brushback pitch.""

""If there's not pushback,"" he says, the authorities are going to ""keep doing what they are doing.""

“The press covered Hillary Clinton like the next president of the United States. The press covered Donald Trump like a future trivia question (and a ratings cash cow),” Mr. Poniewozik wrote.

The issue of “false balance” came up frequently during the campaign, and some observers argued that the press felt a need to compensate for negative stories about Mr. Trump with critical articles about Mrs. Clinton (which Trump supporters often argued did not receive enough attention.)

Margaret Sullivan, media columnist at the Washington Post, wrote that the media “helped [Mr. Trump] tremendously” thanks to “ridiculous emphasis put on every development about Hillary Clinton’s email practices, including the waffling of FBI Director James B. Comey.”

As news companies embark on their post-mortems, social giants like Facebook, Snapchat and Twitter may also want to look inward about their roles in shaping public opinion during the campaign, even if they prefer to think of themselves as tech companies rather than powerful media behemoths.

So what’s a social media user to do? Katy Byron, the editor and program manager of MediaWise, advises online readers to ask three simple questions: Who is behind the information? What is the evidence? And what are other sources saying?

Draft rumors are nothing new, says University of Southern California historian Nicholas Cull. But modern technology confounds our efforts to tell fact from fiction. “We’re living in one of those dangerous moments right now,” he says.

The killing of Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani of Iran on Jan. 3 sent waves of diplomatic uncertainty throughout the Middle East.

One prominent series of rumors circulating on social media claimed that the United States had instituted the draft.

Truth, it is often said, is the first casualty of war, and in the wake of the assassination of Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani of Iran on Jan. 3, misinformation ran rampant.

In the days following the U.S.-led drone strike, the White House’s rationales for the attack shifted wildly.

A fog of misinformation

One rumor claimed that the U.S. had instituted the draft. Another rumor claimed that LGBT people were exempt. Another claimed that felons were exempt. By the end of the day of the drone strike, the servers for the U.S. Selective Service System’s website had crashed.

“The two-day period after the news broke were very confusing to young people,” says Katy Byron, the editor and program manager of MediaWise, a Poynter Institute for Media Studies project aimed at helping teenagers identify online misinformation.

Professor Cull points out that draft rumors are nothing new; a prevalent rumor in the spring of 1942 claimed Jews were exempt. But, he says, modern technology confounds our efforts to tell fact from fiction. “We’re living in one of those dangerous moments right now. [There is a] tremendous instability from the overlap of social media and big data-powered targeting of social media that we are in the process of learning to deal with.”

Programmed to spread

Misinformation on social media presents a thorny problem. Recommendation algorithms, like the kind that determine what appears in your Facebook newsfeed or YouTube’s “up next” list, cannot by themselves distinguish truth from lies. All they can do is measure how people “engage” with the content: whether they scroll past it or linger on it, whether they click on the thumbs, hearts, or other icons associated with the post, and how much time they spend interacting with it.

This algorithmic agnosticism often leads to perverse results. Social networks assign higher ranks to content that prompts more engagement, regardless of whether the content is true or whether it improves the engager’s life. And the more highly ranked a piece of content is, the more likely people will see it. That means that, if you come across a Facebook post that you think is false and you write a thoughtful point-by-point rebuttal of it, you’ve made it more likely that the misinformation will appear in more peoples’ Facebook news feeds.

What’s more, today’s media landscape is immeasurably more fragmented than it was in 1967. To reach its audience, misinformation – and its deliberate subset, disinformation – no longer needs to travel the highways afforded by the major news outlets; instead, it can travel the backroads created by niche targeting. That means that what you see may not be what everyone else, including professional fact-checkers, see.

“You don’t have the right to not have your speech known about just because you’re trying to hide it from someone,” he says.

How to respond?

If you spot misinformation in your news feed, one option, Professor Cull suggests, might be to go outside the infrastructure. In other words, if a friend posts a false news report on Twitter, instead of responding via Twitter and inadvertently boosting engagement to the original post, you could send that friend an email instead.

By many accounts , this is not going to be easy . Recently Lee Bebout , a professor at Arizona State University , was viciously attacked by white supremacist groups for offering a course titled “ US Race Theory and the Problem with Whiteness , ” and again Fox played a major role in fanning the flames of racist reaction :
The class , which began on Jan. 12 , received national attention Jan. 23 when Fox News correspondent Elisabeth Hasselbeck called the course `` quite unfair , and wrong and pointed '' on Fox & Friends . Lauren Clark , an ASU junior who is not in the class or in the English program , said on the show that the class `` suggests an entire race is the problem . '' The segment ignited a media frenzy , and Bebout began receiving hate mail the day it aired , according to a police report . Over the next two months , Bebout received at least 70 hostile e-mails from opponents of the class , according to records provided by ASU .
As a young student not in the class or even in the English program ( and that might explain a lot ) Ms. Clark should probably not be faulted too much for reading past the actual title of the course -- it was “ whiteness , '' not “ whites ” — but the fact that the supposed adults at Fox could not manage to think twice , or simply think , is telling . Again , it was more to their interest to drum up hatred based on a false charge , and sit back as the situation got uglier and more violent .
On Jan. 29 , someone distributed fliers on the driveways of Bebout 's and others ' homes in his neighborhood with `` Anti-White '' printed over his face and reading `` Arizona State University is Anti-White , '' according to Tempe police . The act of putting the flier on Bebout 's driveway constituted misdemeanor harassment , the report said . The fliers were labeled `` National Youth Front . '' NYF is a `` youth organization dedicated to the preservation of all White people , '' according to the website for the group , which has a Phoenix chapter of unknown size . The group is characterized as a `` newly formed youth wing of the White nationalist American Freedom Party '' by the Southern Poverty Law Center , an Alabama-based civil-rights organization… In February , commenters on white-supremacist websites posted a photo of Bebout with his family , along with disparaging comments , his contact information and other personal details .
One should note that Dylann Roof was enamored of such groups .
Three years ago , in 2012 , CNN ran a story titled “ Has ‘ whiteness studies ’ run its course in colleges ? ” The question was prompted by the fact of Obama ’ s election and what that supposedly signaled : a “ post-racial ” era . But its conclusion is what is most interesting now , as we contemplate Charleston , McKinney , Texas , and Ferguson , Missouri , and all the other recent manifestations of virulent racism :
Some believe the idea of racism is shifting entirely . A 2008 poll by USA Today/Gallup and showed that 40 % of adults in America think racism against white people is widespread in the United States . A study published last year said that whites increasingly believe that bias against whites is a bigger problem than bias against blacks .
The mass murders at Charleston , and certainly what happened in McKinney , show that this skewed reasoning is on the rise , and the Larger Fox Network is doing all it can to profit from this . And this means that we need to develop a strong and consolidated set of strategies to fight it . Besides strengthening anti-racist education , we need to turn to the rest of the media , outside Fox and its ilk .
This is absolutely essential ; mainstream and other news venues must not weaken their attention to the systemic nature of racism in America . We need to continue to file our commentaries consistently , and have our voices heard . We need to call out all the lies the Larger Fox Network spreads and more . It is not enough to ridicule them — we need to present a correct and accurate rebuttal to what they say . And more than that , we need news outlets to give us the space and time to get our viewpoints out there , even if it is not part of a major headline-grabbing news story . This is much more than a “ story ” ; racism and white supremacy are disgraceful and utterly destructive parts of our national history . We need to read about that history , and learn from it . The alternative looks very bloody .","There has been some speculation as to whether Dylann Roof is insane, or was so at the time of the shooting at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina.

NYF is a ""youth organization dedicated to the preservation of all White people,"" according to the website for the group, which has a Phoenix chapter of unknown size. The group is characterized as a ""newly formed youth wing of the White nationalist American Freedom Party"" by the Southern Poverty Law Center, an Alabama-based civil-rights organization… In February, commenters on white-supremacist websites posted a photo of Bebout with his family, along with disparaging comments, his contact information and other personal details.

One should note that Dylann Roof was enamored of such groups.

Three years ago, in 2012, CNN ran a story titled “Has ‘whiteness studies’ run its course in colleges?” The question was prompted by the fact of Obama’s election and what that supposedly signaled: a “post-racial” era. But its conclusion is what is most interesting now, as we contemplate Charleston, McKinney, Texas, and Ferguson, Missouri, and all the other recent manifestations of virulent racism:

Some believe the idea of racism is shifting entirely. A 2008 poll by USA Today/Gallup and showed that 40% of adults in America think racism against white people is widespread in the United States. A study published last year said that whites increasingly believe that bias against whites is a bigger problem than bias against blacks.

The mass murders at Charleston, and certainly what happened in McKinney, show that this skewed reasoning is on the rise, and the Larger Fox Network is doing all it can to profit from this. And this means that we need to develop a strong and consolidated set of strategies to fight it. Besides strengthening anti-racist education, we need to turn to the rest of the media, outside Fox and its ilk.

This is absolutely essential; mainstream and other news venues must not weaken their attention to the systemic nature of racism in America. We need to continue to file our commentaries consistently, and have our voices heard. We need to call out all the lies the Larger Fox Network spreads and more. It is not enough to ridicule them — we need to present a correct and accurate rebuttal to what they say. And more than that, we need news outlets to give us the space and time to get our viewpoints out there, even if it is not part of a major headline-grabbing news story. This is much more than a “story”; racism and white supremacy are disgraceful and utterly destructive parts of our national history. We need to read about that history, and learn from it. The alternative looks very bloody.",www.salon.com,left,Q9rd9ChCJd8yFDrV

At Urbana , I met dozens of people who were dedicating their lives to the mission , spreading the good news of Jesus , of course , but doing so through a life of charity and compassion for others : staffing remote hospitals , building homes for the homeless and , in one case , flying a “ powered parachute ” over miles of uninhabited jungle in the western Congo to bring a little bit of entertainment , education and relief to some of the remotest villages you could imagine .

Facebook announced steps Thursday to stem the spread of `` fake news '' on its website , which has taken fire for easing the spread of blatantly false information to voters during the 2016 campaign .
Among other steps , the social network said it will start flagging `` the worst of the worst '' hoaxes shared on the site , which draws more than a billion users in an average day .
`` We 're committed to doing our part , '' said Facebook Vice President of Product Development Adam Mosseri in a post announcing the move . `` It 's important to us that the stories you see on Facebook are authentic and meaningful . ''
The company 's new approach relies on the work of nonpartisan fact checkers assembled under the banner of the Poynter International Fact-Checking Network , a global project of the media institute that also owns the Tampa Bay Times .
Under the new system , when Facebook users attempt to post a story that Poynter-affiliated fact checkers have rebutted , they 'll get a pop-up saying , `` Before you share this story , you might want to know that independent fact-checkers disputed its accuracy . '' If the user opts to go ahead , the post will still appear on their friends ' News Feeds , but it will be tagged with red danger-style signal indicating its veracity is in dispute — with a link to a fact checker 's debunking .
In a story in ███ last week , Alexios Mantzarlis , director and editor of the Poynter Institute 's International Fact-Checking Network , said that while `` Facebook has completely turbo-powered fake news sites ... it 's also probably the first platform that could measure how these things spread , and how we could push back . ''
Among the other steps Facebook is taking is to make it easier for users to alert both Facebook and their fellow users that something they see on the site seems fake ; the reports on flagged stories , says Facebook , will be fed back to the fact checkers to make it easier for them to target their efforts .
With this plan , Facebook is leaning heavily on a small number of fact checkers . The members of the so-called Big Three in American fact checking — FactCheck.org , PolitiFact and The Washington Post 's Fact Checkers — employ fewer than 20 people .
Facebook 's experiment , too , may spark concern from those who argue that those third-party fact checkers come to the effort with their own biases and lenses .
The Poynter network , according to Mantzarlis , has no formal membership , though some 40 organizations around the world have signed onto its code of principles . The project gets funding from , among others , Google , the Omidyar Network , the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Open Society Foundations .
Facebook has already found itself the target of political ire for its curating of news , most notably after a report surfaced of the company stripping right-leaning news from the site 's `` trending '' box . That episode was a particular affront to conservatives , who complain they are treated unfairly by so-called mainstream news organizations and have turned to social media as a favored platform .
Mark Zuckerberg has resisted both the idea that `` fake news '' on Facebook had anything to do with the outcome of the 2016 election and that Facebook is a media company . But Thursday 's announcement — along with an earlier post detailing his work-in-progress thinking on tackling the challenges posed by online hoaxes — suggest that he 's seeing the topic as a more serious threat .
The risks of being cast as an online gatekeeper might be tempered by the company 's focus on what Mosseri , the Facebook vice president , calls `` the clear hoaxes spread by spammers for their own gain . '' Researchers say that addressing even a handful of viral posts can significantly reduce the amount of false material appearing on the social network .
`` Let 's not underestimate how important it is to act on the biggest fakes , '' Mantzarlis previously told ███ .
Facebook said Thursday that it will also be trying out a handful of other ways of facing off with fake news , like preventing flagged stories from being used as the basis of ads and weakening the News Feed-ranking of stories that users are less likely to share after reading — a possible signal , the company has said , that users feel that the story is misleading .
`` We believe in giving people a voice and that we can not become arbiters of truth ourselves , so we 're approaching this problem carefully , '' wrote Mosseri in his post . `` We 'll learn from these tests , and iterate and extend them over time .

Among the other steps Facebook is taking is to make it easier for users to alert both Facebook and their fellow users that something they see on the site seems fake; the reports on flagged stories, says Facebook, will be fed back to the fact checkers to make it easier for them to target their efforts.

With this plan, Facebook is leaning heavily on a small number of fact checkers. The members of the so-called Big Three in American fact checking — FactCheck.org, PolitiFact and The Washington Post's Fact Checkers — employ fewer than 20 people.

Facebook's experiment, too, may spark concern from those who argue that those third-party fact checkers come to the effort with their own biases and lenses.

The Poynter network, according to Mantzarlis, has no formal membership, though some 40 organizations around the world have signed onto its code of principles. The project gets funding from, among others, Google, the Omidyar Network, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Open Society Foundations.

Facebook has already found itself the target of political ire for its curating of news, most notably after a report surfaced of the company stripping right-leaning news from the site's ""trending"" box. That episode was a particular affront to conservatives, who complain they are treated unfairly by so-called mainstream news organizations and have turned to social media as a favored platform.

Mark Zuckerberg has resisted both the idea that ""fake news"" on Facebook had anything to do with the outcome of the 2016 election and that Facebook is a media company. But Thursday's announcement — along with an earlier post detailing his work-in-progress thinking on tackling the challenges posed by online hoaxes — suggest that he's seeing the topic as a more serious threat.

The risks of being cast as an online gatekeeper might be tempered by the company's focus on what Mosseri, the Facebook vice president, calls ""the clear hoaxes spread by spammers for their own gain."" Researchers say that addressing even a handful of viral posts can significantly reduce the amount of false material appearing on the social network.

""Let's not underestimate how important it is to act on the biggest fakes,"" Mantzarlis previously told POLITICO.

Facebook said Thursday that it will also be trying out a handful of other ways of facing off with fake news, like preventing flagged stories from being used as the basis of ads and weakening the News Feed-ranking of stories that users are less likely to share after reading — a possible signal, the company has said, that users feel that the story is misleading.

""We believe in giving people a voice and that we cannot become arbiters of truth ourselves, so we're approaching this problem carefully,"" wrote Mosseri in his post. ""We'll learn from these tests, and iterate and extend them over time.""",www.politico.com,left,8Fm1Q11hvzm7KTwq

Boo.

The scariest thing this Halloween has nothing to do with witches and goblins or even the Munsters remake (ugh). The scariest thing in America right now is the continued awful economy.

An incumbent president running for re-election in a down economy – we’ve heard that story before. Only when we heard it last time, George W. Bush was running for re-election in 2004 and the economy was in remarkably fine shape.

That horror story hasn’t been told by the major media according to a soon-to-be-released report from the Media Research Center titled “Upside Down Economics.” The report shows the reality of two different elections and how ABC, CBS and NBC chose to depict the Bush economy as doing badly and ignored or downplay the many faults of the Obama economic record.

Lee, Zack Beauchamp, Hannah Brown, Jen Kirby, Peter Kafka, Matthew Yglesias, Sean Collins","News stories are supposed to help ordinary voters understand the world around them . But in the 2016 election , news stories online too often had the opposite effect . Stories rocketed around the internet that were misleading , sloppily reported , or in some cases totally made up .
Over the course of 2016 , Facebook users learned that the pope endorsed Donald Trump ( he didn ’ t ) , that a Democratic operative was murdered after agreeing to testify against Hillary Clinton ( it never happened ) , that Bill Clinton raped a 13-year-old girl ( a total fabrication ) , and many other totally bogus “ news ” stories . Stories like this thrive on Facebook because Facebook ’ s algorithm prioritizes “ engagement ” — and a reliable way to get readers to engage is by making up outrageous nonsense about politicians they don ’ t like .
A big problem here is that the internet has broken down the traditional distinction between professional news-gathering and amateur rumor-mongering . On the internet , the “ Denver Guardian ” — a fake news site designed to look like a real Colorado newspaper — can reach a wide audience as easily as real news organizations like the Denver Post , the New York Times , and Fox News .
Since last week ’ s election , there has been a fierce debate about whether the flood of fake news — much of it prejudicial to Hillary Clinton — could have swung the election to Donald Trump . Internet giants are coming under increasing pressure to do something about the problem .
On Monday , Google announced that it was going to cut fake news sites off from access to its vast advertising network , depriving them of a key revenue source . Facebook quickly followed suit with its own ad network .
At the same time , CEO Mark Zuckerberg has signaled reluctance to have Facebook become more active in weeding out fake news stories . He described it as “ a pretty crazy idea ” to think fake news on Facebook could have swayed the election . He says Facebook will look for new ways to stop the spread of fake news , but he also argues that “ we must proceed very carefully ” and that Facebook must be “ extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth ourselves . ”
The importance of this issue is only going to grow over time . More and more people are getting their news from the internet , putting more and more power in the hands of companies like Google , Twitter , and especially Facebook . The leaders of those companies are going to be under increasing pressure to use that power wisely .
In the 1990s and early 2000s , it was common to think of the internet as a decentralized , even anarchic , place where no one was really in charge . Online-only news organizations were still in their infancy , so that most people either got their news from traditional sources like newspapers or cable news shows , or else they went to the home pages of conventional news organizations like the New York Times , the Atlantic , or Fox News .
The rise of social media sites has changed things in two major ways .
First , social media has drastically lowered barriers to entry in the news business . It has always been easy for anyone to publish a website , of course . But as news consumption is increasingly driven by social media sharing , it ’ s becoming easier than ever for no-name sites to reach a big audience .
At the same time , a handful of big tech companies — Twitter , Google , and especially Facebook — have gained a huge and growing influence over what news people see . 44 percent of US adults tell pollsters they got news from Facebook in 2016 . That ’ s vastly larger than other news-focused social media sites like Twitter ( 9 percent ) and Reddit ( 2 percent ) . And while many people get their news from television programs or newspapers , those media are divided among many competing news organizations . This means that Facebook has a larger influence over ordinary Americans ’ media diets than almost any other news organization .
Normally we think that organizations with a lot of power have an obligation to use that power responsibly . But the leaders of the largest technology companies have resisted thinking of themselves in those terms . They like to think of their sites as neutral platforms that help users share information with each other — without the company making value judgments of its own .
But this isn ’ t how power works . When an authority figure turns a blind eye to a problem that ’ s happening under his watch , the problem doesn ’ t go away . It festers , often becoming an even bigger problem over time .
Fake news is a problem , but we don ’ t know how big it is
The problem of fake news is so new that we don ’ t have definitive data on how big of a problem it is . But there are some reasons to think it could be very significant .
We know that low-quality news stories have proliferated on Facebook . For example , investigations by BuzzFeed and the Guardian found that a group of cynical Macedonian hucksters had created dozens of right-wing news sites that publish low-quality pro-Trump news stories . Some are plagiarized from other conservative news sites . Others appear to be totally made up , with headlines like “ Proof surfaces that Obama was born in Kenya , ” “ Bill Clinton ’ s sex tape just leaked , ” and “ Pope Francis forbids Catholics from voting for Hillary ! ”
“ Yes , the info in the blogs is bad , false , and misleading but the rationale is that ‘ if it gets the people to click on it and engage , then use it , ’ ” a Macedonian student told BuzzFeed .
Other fake news is generated by partisan bloggers taking news tidbits out of context and drawing totally wrong conclusions from them . For example , some confused conservative bloggers misread a leaked email from Clinton adviser John Podesta as evidence that Democrats were manipulating public poll results . In fact , Democrats were using a standard polling technique called oversampling on Democrats ’ own internal polls — but that didn ’ t stop the story from spreading among online conservatives .
And fake news hasn ’ t only circulated on the right-hand side of the political spectrum . A story about Pope Francis endorsing Bernie Sanders was also made up .
As the internet ’ s most popular news source , Facebook appears to have the biggest fake news problem . But it ’ s not a problem that only afflicts Facebook . In the wake of last week ’ s election , one of the top search results on Google was a post claiming that Trump won the popular vote — he didn ’ t .
Facebook is worried about being seen as biased against conservatives
Publicly , Facebook ’ s CEO has downplayed the site ’ s role in distributing fake news online . But privately , there ’ s a raging debate inside Facebook about how it could do more .
BuzzFeed reports that some Facebook employees are frustrated by Zuckerberg ’ s blasé response to concerns about fake news on the social media platform .
“ What ’ s crazy is for him to come out and dismiss it like that , ” one anonymous engineer wrote , according to BuzzFeed . “ He knows , and those of us at the company know , that fake news ran wild on our platform during the entire campaign season . ”
One reason Facebook ’ s management has been so cautious on this issue is that it ’ s still smarting from the controversy earlier this year over Facebook ’ s trending news feature . Until this summer , Facebook employed a team of professional journalists to curate the trending news box that appeared in the right-hand rail next to the Facebook newsfeed .
Then in May , one of Facebook ’ s trending news editors told Gizmodo that the team was routinely suppressing trending stories that slanted in a conservative direction . That caused a massive backlash , including questions from Republicans in Congress about Facebook ’ s editorial policies . This led to Facebook terminating the entire trending news team . Today , Facebook uses software to choose which headlines appear in this box .
But with the human editors gone , Facebook had a new problem : It started to see fake stories showing up in the trending box . Facebook ’ s trending news algorithm simply wasn ’ t sophisticated enough to distinguish an accurate news story from an inaccurate one .
The current debate over fake news on Facebook can be seen as a much broader version of the same controversy . Nobody is going to defend fake news per se . But once you start injecting human editorial judgment into content decisions , questions of bias are inevitably going to come up .
This is a particularly tricky issue because it ’ s not easy to draw a line between articles that are totally fake and articles that are just highly misleading or based on shoddy reporting .
For example , after BuzzFeed reported that 43 percent of articles from a hyperpartisan site called Right Wing News were either “ mostly false ” or a “ mix of true and false , ” the site ’ s editor insisted that many of the articles classified as false were actually accurate . One story claimed that the Clinton Foundation devoted only 10 percent of its revenue to charity , a figure it got from a Federalist article that only counted grants to third-party organizations , not charitable activities carried out by the Clinton Foundation itself , in calculating total charitable spending .
It seems pretty clear that the Federalist and Right Wing News are in the wrong here . It ’ s not reasonable to count a foundation ’ s own charitable programs as overhead . But if Facebook were to classify this story as fake news and ban it from the site , some conservatives are going to see that as evidence of left-wing bias .
Also , any effort to weed out fake news at Facebook ’ s scale is going to lead to some straight-up mistakes . If these mistakes disproportionately target conservative viewpoints , that ’ s going to create a backlash that will hurt Facebook ’ s brand with tens of millions of conservative Facebook users .
“ This is an area where I believe we must proceed very carefully , ” Zuckerberg wrote in a Sunday Facebook post . He argued that many stories “ express an opinion that many will disagree with and flag as incorrect even when factual . I am confident we can find ways for our community to tell us what content is most meaningful , but I believe we must be extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth ourselves . ”
Most of the discussion about how Facebook could address fake news has assumed that the goal is to banish fake news from the platforms . But there are a couple of other approaches that might ultimately work better .
One is that rather than banning fake news , Facebook could give a boost to high-quality news . It ’ s hard to say whether Right Wing News is a fake news site , but it ’ s easy to say that the New York Times and the Washington Times are legitimate news sources . And Facebook ’ s newsfeed algorithm decides which news stories to show users first . Giving high-quality news sources a bonus in the newsfeed algorithm could improve the average quality of news users read without Facebook having to make tricky judgments about which news is and isn ’ t fake .
A second approach would be to change how Facebook presents dubious news stories instead of banning them outright . Right now , when users post a link , Facebook expands that into a “ card ” showing an image , headline , and short sentence describing the article . This format is standardized so that a New York Times article is formatted in the same way as an article from a no-name blog .
But Facebook could change that . Instead of presenting an identical summary card for every link , it could present different kinds of cards — or no card at all — depending on the perceived quality of the source . Credible news sources could show full cards like they do now . Less credible sources could show smaller cards — or no cards at all .
And Facebook could hire a team of fact-checkers to examine the most widely-shared stories . If a story checks out , Facebook could show an icon verifying that the story is authentic . If it doesn ’ t check out , Facebook could include a prominent link to a story explaining that the story is inaccurate . Users would still be free to read the story and disagree with Facebook ’ s verdict . But they ’ d at least be aware that a particular article ’ s claim is disputed .
Ultimately , some level of controversy is inevitable for a topic this political . Any effort to crack down on fake news is going to generate a certain amount of backlash from people whose stories are labeled as bogus . But critics say Zuckerberg has an obligation to try to do something to stem the flood of fake news on his platform .","News stories are supposed to help ordinary voters understand the world around them.

Over the course of 2016, Facebook users learned that the pope endorsed Donald Trump (he didn’t), that a Democratic operative was murdered after agreeing to testify against Hillary Clinton (it never happened), that Bill Clinton raped a 13-year-old girl (a total fabrication), and many other totally bogus “news” stories. Stories like this thrive on Facebook because Facebook’s algorithm prioritizes “engagement” — and a reliable way to get readers to engage is by making up outrageous nonsense about politicians they don’t like.

A big problem here is that the internet has broken down the traditional distinction between professional news-gathering and amateur rumor-mongering. On the internet, the “Denver Guardian” — a fake news site designed to look like a real Colorado newspaper — can reach a wide audience as easily as real news organizations like the Denver Post, the New York Times, and Fox News.

Since last week’s election, there has been a fierce debate about whether the flood of fake news — much of it prejudicial to Hillary Clinton — could have swung the election to Donald Trump. Internet giants are coming under increasing pressure to do something about the problem.

On Monday, Google announced that it was going to cut fake news sites off from access to its vast advertising network, depriving them of a key revenue source. Facebook quickly followed suit with its own ad network.

At the same time, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has signaled reluctance to have Facebook become more active in weeding out fake news stories. He described it as “a pretty crazy idea” to think fake news on Facebook could have swayed the election. He says Facebook will look for new ways to stop the spread of fake news, but he also argues that “we must proceed very carefully” and that Facebook must be “extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth ourselves.”

The importance of this issue is only going to grow over time. More and more people are getting their news from the internet, putting more and more power in the hands of companies like Google, Twitter, and especially Facebook. The leaders of those companies are going to be under increasing pressure to use that power wisely.

The internet is growing up

In the 1990s and early 2000s, it was common to think of the internet as a decentralized, even anarchic, place where no one was really in charge. Online-only news organizations were still in their infancy, so that most people either got their news from traditional sources like newspapers or cable news shows, or else they went to the home pages of conventional news organizations like the New York Times, the Atlantic, or Fox News.

The rise of social media sites has changed things in two major ways.

First, social media has drastically lowered barriers to entry in the news business. It has always been easy for anyone to publish a website, of course. But as news consumption is increasingly driven by social media sharing, it’s becoming easier than ever for no-name sites to reach a big audience.

At the same time, a handful of big tech companies — Twitter, Google, and especially Facebook — have gained a huge and growing influence over what news people see. 44 percent of US adults tell pollsters they got news from Facebook in 2016. That’s vastly larger than other news-focused social media sites like Twitter (9 percent) and Reddit (2 percent). And while many people get their news from television programs or newspapers, those media are divided among many competing news organizations. This means that Facebook has a larger influence over ordinary Americans’ media diets than almost any other news organization.

Normally we think that organizations with a lot of power have an obligation to use that power responsibly. But the leaders of the largest technology companies have resisted thinking of themselves in those terms. They like to think of their sites as neutral platforms that help users share information with each other — without the company making value judgments of its own.

But this isn’t how power works. When an authority figure turns a blind eye to a problem that’s happening under his watch, the problem doesn’t go away. It festers, often becoming an even bigger problem over time.

Fake news is a problem, but we don’t know how big it is

The problem of fake news is so new that we don’t have definitive data on how big of a problem it is. But there are some reasons to think it could be very significant.

We know that low-quality news stories have proliferated on Facebook. For example, investigations by BuzzFeed and the Guardian found that a group of cynical Macedonian hucksters had created dozens of right-wing news sites that publish low-quality pro-Trump news stories. Some are plagiarized from other conservative news sites. Others appear to be totally made up, with headlines like “Proof surfaces that Obama was born in Kenya,” “Bill Clinton’s sex tape just leaked,” and “Pope Francis forbids Catholics from voting for Hillary!”

“Yes, the info in the blogs is bad, false, and misleading but the rationale is that ‘if it gets the people to click on it and engage, then use it,’” a Macedonian student told BuzzFeed.

Other fake news is generated by partisan bloggers taking news tidbits out of context and drawing totally wrong conclusions from them. For example, some confused conservative bloggers misread a leaked email from Clinton adviser John Podesta as evidence that Democrats were manipulating public poll results. In fact, Democrats were using a standard polling technique called oversampling on Democrats’ own internal polls — but that didn’t stop the story from spreading among online conservatives.

And fake news hasn’t only circulated on the right-hand side of the political spectrum. A story about Pope Francis endorsing Bernie Sanders was also made up.

As the internet’s most popular news source, Facebook appears to have the biggest fake news problem. But it’s not a problem that only afflicts Facebook. In the wake of last week’s election, one of the top search results on Google was a post claiming that Trump won the popular vote — he didn’t.

Facebook is worried about being seen as biased against conservatives

Publicly, Facebook’s CEO has downplayed the site’s role in distributing fake news online. But privately, there’s a raging debate inside Facebook about how it could do more.

BuzzFeed reports that some Facebook employees are frustrated by Zuckerberg’s blasé response to concerns about fake news on the social media platform.

“What’s crazy is for him to come out and dismiss it like that,” one anonymous engineer wrote, according to BuzzFeed. “He knows, and those of us at the company know, that fake news ran wild on our platform during the entire campaign season.”

One reason Facebook’s management has been so cautious on this issue is that it’s still smarting from the controversy earlier this year over Facebook’s trending news feature. Until this summer, Facebook employed a team of professional journalists to curate the trending news box that appeared in the right-hand rail next to the Facebook newsfeed.

Then in May, one of Facebook’s trending news editors told Gizmodo that the team was routinely suppressing trending stories that slanted in a conservative direction. That caused a massive backlash, including questions from Republicans in Congress about Facebook’s editorial policies. This led to Facebook terminating the entire trending news team. Today, Facebook uses software to choose which headlines appear in this box.

But with the human editors gone, Facebook had a new problem: It started to see fake stories showing up in the trending box. Facebook’s trending news algorithm simply wasn’t sophisticated enough to distinguish an accurate news story from an inaccurate one.

The current debate over fake news on Facebook can be seen as a much broader version of the same controversy. Nobody is going to defend fake news per se. But once you start injecting human editorial judgment into content decisions, questions of bias are inevitably going to come up.

This is a particularly tricky issue because it’s not easy to draw a line between articles that are totally fake and articles that are just highly misleading or based on shoddy reporting.

For example, after BuzzFeed reported that 43 percent of articles from a hyperpartisan site called Right Wing News were either “mostly false” or a “mix of true and false,” the site’s editor insisted that many of the articles classified as false were actually accurate. One story claimed that the Clinton Foundation devoted only 10 percent of its revenue to charity, a figure it got from a Federalist article that only counted grants to third-party organizations, not charitable activities carried out by the Clinton Foundation itself, in calculating total charitable spending.

It seems pretty clear that the Federalist and Right Wing News are in the wrong here. It’s not reasonable to count a foundation’s own charitable programs as overhead. But if Facebook were to classify this story as fake news and ban it from the site, some conservatives are going to see that as evidence of left-wing bias.

Also, any effort to weed out fake news at Facebook’s scale is going to lead to some straight-up mistakes. If these mistakes disproportionately target conservative viewpoints, that’s going to create a backlash that will hurt Facebook’s brand with tens of millions of conservative Facebook users.

“This is an area where I believe we must proceed very carefully,” Zuckerberg wrote in a Sunday Facebook post. He argued that many stories “express an opinion that many will disagree with and flag as incorrect even when factual. I am confident we can find ways for our community to tell us what content is most meaningful, but I believe we must be extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth ourselves.”

Banning fake news might be the wrong approach

Most of the discussion about how Facebook could address fake news has assumed that the goal is to banish fake news from the platforms. But there are a couple of other approaches that might ultimately work better.

One is that rather than banning fake news, Facebook could give a boost to high-quality news. It’s hard to say whether Right Wing News is a fake news site, but it’s easy to say that the New York Times and the Washington Times are legitimate news sources. And Facebook’s newsfeed algorithm decides which news stories to show users first. Giving high-quality news sources a bonus in the newsfeed algorithm could improve the average quality of news users read without Facebook having to make tricky judgments about which news is and isn’t fake.

A second approach would be to change how Facebook presents dubious news stories instead of banning them outright. Right now, when users post a link, Facebook expands that into a “card” showing an image, headline, and short sentence describing the article. This format is standardized so that a New York Times article is formatted in the same way as an article from a no-name blog.

But Facebook could change that. Instead of presenting an identical summary card for every link, it could present different kinds of cards — or no card at all — depending on the perceived quality of the source. Credible news sources could show full cards like they do now. Less credible sources could show smaller cards — or no cards at all.

And Facebook could hire a team of fact-checkers to examine the most widely-shared stories. If a story checks out, Facebook could show an icon verifying that the story is authentic. If it doesn’t check out, Facebook could include a prominent link to a story explaining that the story is inaccurate. Users would still be free to read the story and disagree with Facebook’s verdict. But they’d at least be aware that a particular article’s claim is disputed.

Ultimately, some level of controversy is inevitable for a topic this political. Any effort to crack down on fake news is going to generate a certain amount of backlash from people whose stories are labeled as bogus.
