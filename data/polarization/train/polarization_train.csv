Now a new study co-authored by MIT economist David Autor ( along with non-MIT colleagues David Dorn , Gordon Hanson , and Kaveh Majlesi ) identifies a political effect from this economic process . From 2002 through 2010 , in U.S. congressional districts particularly affected by job losses due to trade , elected members of the House of Representatives becamemore ideologically extreme , with moderates consistently losing out in both parties .

Q . Your new working paper establishes a strong relationship between job losses in the U.S. due to global trade , and political changes in the U.S. Congress — but the phenomenon at work is not what many people might guess . What did you find ?
A. There ’ s been a 30-year trend of rising polarization in the U.S. Congress . A lot of areas economically affected by rising trade exposure , especially in the South , have also been moving politically to the right . We wondered if these economic shocks might be contributing to the political factionalization . There are multiple ways this could work . One would be an anti-incumbent effect : It ’ s well established that politicians are punished for bad economic outcomes . But we don ’ t find that . Another possibility might be that the effects of trade shocks would just strongly favor one party over another . But the answer there is also no , not really .
However , if you look at ideology rather than party , you do see very sharp movements . But they ’ re movements across ideological space . So moderate Democrats and moderate Republicans are being voted out of office in trade-exposed areas and being replaced with much more ideologically ardent substitutes . A lot of these gains are on the right . But that ’ s not entirely the case . If you look at initially Democratic voting districts , you see a very sharp movement to the left — as well as , to some degree , gains for Republicans in some of those districts . So you see this polarization occurring where moderates of both parties are being removed in trade-affected areas , and are being replaced by candidates who win by smaller margins and have more ideological views .
Q . Is it fair to say this also corresponds to the ethnic composition of the voters in these congressional districts ? And what accounts for this subtle wrinkle in the findings , in which a few of these districts do flip from the Democrats to the Republicans ?
A . We haven ’ t done an overwhelming number of ethnic breakdowns , but the one we did that we thought was useful , was that we broke districts into those where the majority of the population was non-Hispanic white , and those where less than half of the population was non-Hispanic white . There are only 66 districts in the study [ out of 435 in Congress ] which are majority-minority . But in those cases you see very sharp movements to the left . By contrast , in the areas that are majority non-Hispanic white , all the movement is to the right : Moderate Democrats are removed from office , moderate Republicans are removed from office to a lesser extent , and conservative Republicans make enormous gains . And there are no gains for Democrats .
Q . In terms of voter beliefs , what is the mechanism here ? What explains how such similar types of job losses due to trade lead to such divergent political outcomes ?
A . Imagine you have two groups of people , liberals and conservatives , and they share the same objective : They want workers to be employed and protected from the shocks of globalization . And then you have a big [ trade ] shock , and a lot of people lose employment . You might think everyone should converge on what we should do about that . But you can have a setting where beliefs are sufficiently disjointed , such that the same information is interpreted in completely different ways by people observing it . Say I ’ m a liberal Democrat and I want workers to be protected . A trade shock might lead me to say , “ This confirms what I suspected .

You might say , “ This confirms what I suspected , that we need strong nationalistic policies [ such as tariffs ] to protect our workers. ” People are responding in a schismatic sense to the same underlying phenomena .

In the aftermath of the horror of the Charlottesville riot, there’s been less condemnation by the media and the left of the neo-Nazi that is charged with murdering Heather Heyer and injuring at least 19 others than there has been of President Trump.

Americans know full well the environment of hate and violence that identity politics has served us. It has manifested in many ways, including last year during a peaceful Black Lives Matter march in Dallas when an African-American military veteran murdered five police officers. Officials said the sniper was determined to kill as many white officers as possible.

In June, the nation was shocked with the attempted assassination of more than 20 Republican members of Congress. A deranged liberal political activist and Bernie Sanders supporter seriously injured Rep. Steve Scalise and wounded four others.

Now, despite the left and its media cohorts attempting to cast the riot as one-sided, neo-Nazis, the Klan and a Trump-hating anarchist group called “Antifa” gathered in Charlottesville with the intention of doing violence to each other. The end result was the killing of Ms. Heyer, and a related helicopter crash killing two Virginia State Police officers.

Instead of addressing our increasingly toxic political and social environment, the answer for the media and the political class was to pour more gas on the fire.

Suddenly, Mr. Trump was responsible for the carnage, and even worse, the Nazis on-site in Charlottesville were his base (we’re told), ergo all Mr. Trump’s supporters are Nazis, too. The intent from the start was to conflate the president and all conservatives with white supremacy and the obscenity in Charlottesville.

Markos Moulitsas, a leftist activist, Democratic Party operative and co-founder of Vox media, has been cheering on this agenda, and made the new liberal narrative clear on Twitter: “NRA and American conservatives/Nazis are one and the same.”

Sen. Bernard Sanders tweeted, “Do I think the president bares [sic] some responsibility for what happened Charlottesville? Absolutely, yes.” He eventually deleted that and settled on, “The message President Trump sent out to racists and neo-Nazis all over the country this past weekend is this is okay.”

A strange approach for a man whose former campaign volunteer and supporter tried to assassinate Mr. Scalise and so many others. By Mr. Sanders’ logic, he bears personal responsibility for that heinous attack, as well.

In addition to the Jew-hating white supremacists in Charlottesville, there was a group called Antifa, a Trump-hating group of violent anarchists. They say they fight against “fascists.” What they do is destroy property, burn down buildings, attack people they don’t like and use urine bombs on the police and others.

In a piece titled “The Roots of Left Wing Violence,” the National Review explains, “Antifa have emerged as the militant fringe of #TheResistance against Donald Trump — who, they maintain, is a fascist, ushering into power a fascist regime. In Washington, D.C., Antifa spent the morning of Inauguration Day lighting trash cans on fire, throwing rocks and bottles at police officers, setting ablaze a limousine, and tossing chunks of pavement through the windows of several businesses. On February 1, Antifa set fires and stormed buildings at the University of California, Berkeley to prevent an appearance by Breitbart provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos. (They succeeded.) In April, they threatened violence if Ann Coulter spoke on the campus; when the university and local law enforcement refused to find a secure location for her to speak, she withdrew, saying the situation was too dangerous.”

In June, Antifa attacked police in Portland, Oregon, as the police worked to keep white supremacists and Antifa fascists separated during a protest. Willamette Week reported, “Portland Police Chief Mike Marshman said today that riot cops pushed antifascist and anarchist protesters out of downtown parks June 4 after the protesters used slingshots to launch balloons filled with urine, feces and unknown chemicals into police ranks.” Other weapons seized included hammers, scissors and bricks.

In Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, an Antifa protester was arrested for allegedly stabbing a police horse in the neck with a flagpole. The anarchist was “with a group of Antifa demonstrators at the march when she attacked a police horse named Samson with a flagpole that had a silver nail attached at the top. [Lisa] Simon hit Samson in the side of the neck,” the Daily Caller reported. The horse recovered.

Because nothing says anti-fascist like throwing urine and feces at people and stabbing horses in the neck.

As the left and their media enablers work to smear every Trump supporter as a Nazi, the fact of the matter is this: Antifa no more represents the average liberal than neo-Nazis and the Klan represent conservatives, including those who support the president.

The concerted effort by the so-called “Resistance” to further divide this nation is disgusting and dangerous. By singularly focusing on such a craven goal of race hatred and suspicion, and conflating white supremacists with all Trump voters, they not only ignore the real issue of the danger of identity politics, they contribute to it.

polarization,Wikipedia,1,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization_(politics),Polarization (politics),,,"In politics , polarization ( or polarisation ) can refer to the divergence of political attitudes to ideological extremes . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Almost all discussions of polarization in political science consider polarization in the context of political parties and democratic systems of government . When polarization occurs in a two-party system , like the United States , moderate voices often lose power and influence . [ 1 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ]
Political polarization refers to the cases in which an individual 's stance on a given issue , policy , or person is more likely to be strictly defined by their identification with a particular political party ( e.g. , Democrat or Republican ) or ideology ( e.g. , liberal or conservative ) . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] According to DiMaggio et al . ( 1996 ) , `` Polarization is both a state and a process . Polarization as a state refers to the extent to which opinions on an issue are opposed in relation to some theoretical maximum . Polarization as a process refers to the increase in such opposition over time . `` [ 1 ] Some political scientists argue that polarization requires divergence on a broad range of issues based on a consistent set of beliefs . [ 1 ] [ 3 ] Others argue polarization occurs when there are stark partisan or ideological divides , even if the opinion is polarized only on a few issues . [ 2 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ]
Political scientists typically distinguish between two types of political polarization : elite polarization and popular polarization . `` Elite polarization '' refers to the polarization of political elites , like party organizers and elected officials , while `` popular polarization '' ( or mass polarization ) refers to the polarization in the electorate and general public . In either context , opinions and policy positions are characterized by strict adherence to party lines . Elite polarization and popular polarization can occur at the same time or independent of each other . A central issue in the study of political polarization is investigating the relationship between elite polarization and popular polarization , particularly any causal relationships between the two . [ 3 ] [ 5 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ]
Political polarization in the United States House of Representatives ( DW-Nominate scores )
Elite polarization refers to polarization in the party-in-government and party-as-organization . [ 2 ] It occurs when party members ( both elected government officials and activists within the party organization itself ) grow more internally homogenous on policy positions and more divergent relative to members of other parties . Polarized political parties are internally cohesive , unified , programmatic , and ideologically distinct ; they are typically found in a parliamentary system of democratic governance . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ]
In a two-party system like the U.S. , a polarized legislature has two important characteristics : first , there is little-to-no ideological overlap between members of the two parties ; and second , almost all conflict over legislation and policies is split across the broad liberal/conservative ideological divide . This leads to the conflation of political parties and ideologies ( i.e. , Democrat and Republican become nearly perfect synonyms for liberal and conservative ) and the collapse of the ideological center . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ]
The vast majority of studies on elite polarization focus on legislative and deliberative bodies . For many years , political scientists measured polarization by examining the ratings of party members published by interest groups , but now , most analyze roll-call voting patterns to determine trends in party-line voting and party unity . [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Many political scientists studying American politics rely on Poole and Rosenthal 's DW-NOMINATE scores , which assign a single liberal-conservative score to each congressperson , enabling comparisons of members from different Congresses . There is much more research on polarization in Congress than on polarization in the other branches of government or in state governments . [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 9 ] Azzimonti 's political polarization index is more comprehensive instead because it is based on media coverage of newspaper articles reporting political disagreement about policy in all branches of government . [ 14 ] Recent work by Gentzkow , Shapiro , and Taddy has used the text of the Congressional Record to document differences in speech patterns between Republicans and Democrats as a measure of polarization . They find that polarization has increased dramatically since 1994 . [ 15 ]
Popular polarization , or mass polarization , occurs when the electorate 's attitudes towards political issues , policies , and people are starkly divided along partisan lines . Members of the electorate and general public typically become less moderate in cases of popular polarization . [ 5 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 16 ] In the U.S. , media accounts typically simplify popular polarization to a divide between red states and blue states or a `` culture war '' between values-voters and progressives . Political scientists , though , generally agree that such accounts are too simplistic and ignore the complex factors that can account for polarization . [ 9 ] [ 17 ] Many political scientists consider political polarization a top-down process , in which elite polarization leads to – or at least precedes – popular polarization . [ 18 ] However , polarization among elites does not necessarily produce polarization within the electorate , and polarized electoral choices can often reflect elite polarization rather than voters ' preferences . [ 3 ] [ 5 ] [ 8 ] [ 10 ] [ 16 ]
Political scientists studying popular polarization typically rely on data from opinion polls and election surveys . They look for trends in respondents ' opinions on a given issue , their voting history , and their political ideology ( conservative , liberal , moderate , etc . ) , and they try to relate those trends to respondents ' party identification and other potentially polarizing factors ( like geographic location or income bracket ) . [ 1 ] [ 8 ] Political scientists typically limit their inquiry to issues and questions that have been constant over time , in order to compare the present day to what the political climate has historically been . [ 16 ] Oft-cited public opinion polls in the U.S. include those run by the Pew Research Center and Gallup , Inc. , while political scientists also rely on more academic surveys , like the General Social Survey and the election surveys and `` feeling thermometer '' polls conducted by National Election Studies . [ 3 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 16 ]
There are various causes of political polarization and these include political parties , redistricting , the public 's political ideology , and the mass media .
Some scholars argue that diverging parties has been one of the major driving forces of polarization as policy platforms have become more distant . This theory is based on recent trends in the United States Congress , where the majority party prioritizes the positions that are most aligned with its party platform and political ideology . [ 19 ] The adoption of more ideologically distinct positions by political parties can cause polarization among both elites and the electorate . For example , after the passage of the Voting Rights Act , the number of conservative Democrats in Congress decreased , while the number of conservative Republicans increased . Within the electorate during the 1970s , Southern Democrats shifted toward the Republican Party , showing polarization among both the elites and the electorate of both main parties . [ 4 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ]
Political scientists have shown politicians have an incentive to advance and support polarized positions . [ 22 ] These argue that during the early 1990s , the Republican Party used polarizing tactics to become the majority party in the United States House of Representatives—which political scientists Thomas E. Mann and Norman Ornstein refer to as Newt Gingrich 's `` guerrilla war . `` [ 4 ] What political scientists have found is that moderates are less likely to run than are candidates who are in line with party doctrine , otherwise known as `` party fit . `` [ 23 ] Other theories state politicians who cater to more extreme groups within their party tend to be more successful , helping them stay in office while simultaneously pulling their constituency toward a polar extreme . [ 24 ] A study by Nicholson ( 2012 ) found voters are more polarized by contentious statements from leaders of the opposing party than from the leaders of their own party . As a result , political leaders may be more likely to take polarized stances . [ 25 ]
With regards to multiparty systems , Giovanni Sartori ( 1966 , 1976 ) claims the splitting of ideologies in the public constituency causes further divides within the political parties of the countries . He theorizes that the extremism of public ideological movement is the basis for the creation of highly polarized multiparty systems . Sartori named this polarizing phenomenon polarized pluralism and claimed it would lead to further polarization in many opposing directions ( as opposed to in simply two directions , as in a polarized two-party system ) over policy issues . [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] Polarization in multiparty systems can also be defined along two ideological extremes , like in the case of India in the 1970s . Ideological splits within a number of India 's major parties resulted in two polarized coalitions on the right and left , each consisting of multiple political parties . [ 29 ]
Political fund-raisers and donors can also exert significant influence and control over legislators . Party leaders are expected to be productive fund-raisers , in order to support the party 's campaigns . After Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission , special interests in the U.S. were able to greatly impact elections through increased undisclosed spending , notably through Super political action committees . Some , such as Washington Post opinion writer Robert Kaiser , argued this allowed wealthy people , corporations , unions , and other groups to push the parties ' policy platforms toward ideological extremes , resulting in a state of greater polarization . [ 4 ] [ 30 ] Other scholars , such as Raymond J . La Raja and David L. Wiltse , note that this does not necessarily hold true for mass donors to political campaigns . These scholars argue a single donor who is polarized and contributes large sums to a campaign does not seem to usually drive a politician toward political extremes . [ 31 ] [ 32 ]
In democracies and other representative governments , citizens vote for the political actors who will represent them . Some scholars argue that political polarization reflects the public 's ideology and voting preferences . [ 21 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] Dixit and Weibull ( 2007 ) claim that political polarization is a natural and regular phenomenon . They argue that there is a link between public differences in ideology and the polarization of representatives , but that an increase in preference differences is usually temporary and ultimately results in compromise . [ 36 ]
Morris P. Fiorina ( 2006 , 2008 ) posits the hypothesis that polarization is a phenomenon which does not hold for the public , and instead is formulated by commentators to draw further division in government . [ 3 ] [ 17 ] [ 37 ] Other studies indicate that cultural differences focusing on ideological movements and geographical polarization within the United States constituency is correlated with rises in overall political polarization between 1972 and 2004 . [ 6 ] [ 38 ]
Religious , ethnic , and other cultural divides within the public have often influenced the emergence of polarization . According to Layman et al . ( 2005 ) , the ideological split between U.S. Republicans and Democrats also crosses into the religious cultural divide . They claim that Democrats have generally become more moderate in religious views whereas Republicans have become more traditionalist . For example , political scientists have shown that in the United States , voters who identify as Republican are more likely to vote for a strongly evangelical candidate than Democratic voters . [ 39 ] This correlates with the rise in polarization in the United States . [ 40 ] Another theory contends that religion does not contribute to full-group polarization , but rather , coalition and party activist polarization causes party shifts toward a political extreme . [ 41 ]
In some post-colonial countries , the public may be polarized along ethnic divides that remain from the colonial regime . [ 42 ] In South Africa in the late 1980s , members of the conservative , pro-apartheid National Party of South Africa were no longer supportive of apartheid , and , therefore , no longer ideologically aligned with their party . Dutch Afrikaners , white English , and native Africans split based on racial divisions , causing polarization along ethnic lines . [ 43 ] [ 44 ]
Economic inequality can also motivate the polarization of the public . For example , in post-World War I Germany , the Communist Workers Party , and the National Socialists , a fascist party , emerged as the dominant political ideologies and proposed to address Germany 's economic problems in drastically different ways . [ 26 ] [ 27 ] In Venezuela in the late 20th century , the entrance of the oil industry into the local economy caused economic disparities that led to sharp ideological divides . As a result , the disenfranchised working class aligned with extreme socialist leader Hugo Chávez . [ 45 ]
The impact of redistricting -- potentially through Gerrymandering or the manipulation of electoral borders to favor a political party -- on political polarization in the United States has been found to be minimal in research by leading political scientists . The logic for this minimal effect is twofold : first , gerrymandering is typically accomplished by packing opposition voters into a minority of congressional districts in a region , while distributing the preferred party 's voters over a majority of districts by a slimmer majority than otherwise would have existed . The result of this is that the number of competitive congressional districts would be expected to increase , and in competitive districts representatives have to compete with the other party for the median voter , who tends to be more ideologically moderate . Second , political polarization has also occurred in the Senate , which does not experience redistricting because Senators represent fixed geographical units , i.e . states . [ 46 ] [ 47 ] The argument that redistricting , through gerrymandering , would contribute to political polarization is based on the idea that new non-competitive districts created would lead to the election of extremist candidates representing the supermajority party , with no accountability to the voice of the minority . One difficulty in testing this hypothesis is to disentangle gerrymandering effects from natural geographical sorting through individuals moving to congressional districts with a similar ideological makeup to their own . Carson et al . ( 2007 ) , has found that redistricting has contributed to the greater level of polarization in the House of Representatives than in the Senate , however that this effect has been `` relatively modest '' . [ 48 ] Politically motivated redistricting has been associated with the rise in partisanship in the U.S. House of Representatives between 1992 and 1994 . [ 49 ] [ 50 ]
The mass media has grown as an institution over the past half-century . Political scientists argue that this has particularly affected the voting public in the last three decades , as previously less partisan viewers are given more polarized news media choices . The mass media 's current , fragmented , high-choice environment has induced a movement of the audience from more even-toned political programming to more antagonistic and one-sided broadcasts and articles . These programs tend to appeal to partisan viewers who watch the polarized programming as a self-confirming source for their ideologies . [ 4 ] [ 8 ] [ 51 ] Countries with less diversified but emerging media markets , such as China and South Korea , have become more polarized due to the diversification of political media . [ 52 ] [ 53 ] In addition , most search engines and social networks ( e.g. , Google , Facebook ) now utilize computer algorithms as filters , which personalize web content based on a user 's search history , location , and previous clicking patterns , creating more polarized access to information . [ 54 ] This method of personalizing web content results in filter bubbles , a term coined by digital activist Eli Pariser that refers to the polarized ideological bubbles that are created by computer algorithms filtering out unrelated information and opposing views . [ 55 ]
A 2011 study found ideological segregation of online news consumption is lower than the segregation of most offline news consumption and lower than the segregation of face-to-face interactions . [ 56 ] This suggests that the filter bubbles effects of online media consumption are exaggerated . Other research also shows that online media does not contribute to the increased polarization of opinions . [ 57 ]
A 2017 study found that providing people with impartial , objective information has the potential to reduce political polarization , but the effect of information on polarization is highly sensitive to contextual factors . [ 58 ] Specifically , polarization over government spending was reduced when people were provided with a `` Taxpayer Receipt , '' but not when they were also asked how they wanted the money to be spent . This suggests that subtle factors like the mood and tone of partisan news sources may have a large effect on how the same information is interpreted .
The implications of political polarization `` are not entirely clear and may include some benefits as well as detrimental consequences . `` [ 59 ] While its exact effects are disputed , it clearly alters the political process and the political composition of the general public . [ 3 ] [ 6 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ] Solomon Messing and Sean J.

Negative effects of polarization on the United States Congress include increased gridlock and partisanship at the cost of quality and quantity of passed legislation . [ 59 ] [ 63 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ] [ 66 ] It also incentivizes stall tactics and closed rules , such as filibusters on non-contentious issues and excluding minority party members from committee deliberations . [ 4 ] [ 59 ] [ 67 ] These strategies hamper transparency , oversight , and the government 's ability to handle long-term domestic issues , especially those regarding the distribution of benefits . [ 63 ] Further , they foster animosity , as majority parties lose bipartisan and legislative coordination trying to expedite legislation to overcome them . [ 4 ] [ 66 ]
Some scholars claim that political polarization is not so pervasive or destructive in influence , contending that partisan agreement is the historical trend in Congress and still frequent in the modern era , including on bills of political importance . [ 68 ] [ 69 ] [ 70 ] Some studies have found approximately 80 % of House bills passed in the modern era to have had support from both parties . [ 68 ]
Opinions on polarization 's effects on the public are mixed . Some argue that the growing polarization in government has directly contributed to political polarization in the electorate , [ 9 ] but this is not unanimous . [ 68 ] [ 71 ]
Some scholars argue that polarization lowers public interest in politics , party identification and voter turnout . [ 9 ] It encourages confrontational dynamics between parties that can lower overall public trust and approval in government . [ 72 ] , and causes the public to perceive the general political debate as less civil , [ 9 ] [ 63 ] which can alienate voters . More polarized candidates , especially when voters are n't aware of the increase , also tend to be less representative of the public 's wishes . [ 9 ] [ 63 ] [ 72 ]
On the other hand , others assert that elite polarization has galvanized the public 's political participation in the United States , citing greater voting and nonvoting participation , engagement and investment in campaigns , and increased positive attitude toward government responsiveness . [ 72 ] [ 73 ] Polarized parties become more ideologically unified , furthering voter knowledge about their positions and increasing their standard to similarly-aligned voters . [ 9 ] [ 73 ]
As Mann and Ornstein argue , political polarization and the proliferation of media sources have `` reinforce [ d ] tribal divisions , while enhancing a climate where facts are no longer driving the debate and deliberation , nor are they shared by the larger public . `` [ 4 ] As other scholars have argued , the media often support and provoke the stall and closed rules tactics that disrupt regular policy procedure . [ 4 ] [ 74 ]
While the media are not immune to general public opinion and reduced polarization allows them to appeal to a larger audience , [ 75 ] polarized environments make it easier for the media and interest groups to hold elected officials more accountable for their policy promises and positions , [ 59 ] [ 74 ] generally healthy for democracy . [ 59 ]
Judicial systems can also be affected by the implications of political polarization . For the United States , in particular , polarization lowers confirmation rates of judges ; [ 67 ] In 2012 , the confirmation rate of presidential circuit court appointments was approximately 50 % as opposed to the above 90 % rate in the late 1970s and early 1980s . [ 4 ] More polarized parties have more aggressively blocked nominees and used tactics to hinder executive agendas . [ 67 ] [ 76 ] Political scientist Sarah Binder ( 2000 ) argues that `` senatorial intolerance for the opposing party ’ s nominees is itself a function of polarization . `` [ 67 ] Negative consequences of this include higher vacancy rates on appellate courts , longer case-processing times and increased caseloads for judges . [ 4 ] [ 65 ] [ 67 ]
Political scientists argue that in highly polarized periods , nominees become less reflective of the moderate voter as `` polarization impacts the appointment and ideological tenor of new federal judges . `` [ 67 ] It also influences the politics of senatorial advice and consent , giving partisan presidents the power to appoint judges far to the left or right of center on the federal bench , obstructing the legitimacy of the judicial branch . [ 65 ] [ 67 ]
Ultimately , the increasing presence of ideology in a judicial system impacts the judiciary 's credibility . [ 59 ] Polarization can generate strong partisan critiques of federal judges , which can damage the public perception of the justice system and the legitimacy of the courts as nonpartisan legal arbiters . [ 67 ] [ 77 ]
Political polarization can undercut unified agreement on foreign policy and harm a nation 's international standing ; [ 59 ] [ 78 ] divisiveness on foreign affairs strengthens enemies , discourages allies and destabilize a nation 's determination . [ 59 ]
Political scientists point to two primary implications of polarization with regards to the foreign policy of the United States '' . First , when the United States conducts relations abroad and appears divided , allies are less likely to trust its promises , enemies are more likely to predict its weaknesses , and uncertainty as to the country 's position in world affairs rises . [ 78 ] [ 79 ] [ 80 ] Second , elite opinion has a significant impact on the public 's perception and understanding of foreign policy , [ 79 ] a field where Americans have less prior knowledge to rely on . [ 78 ] [ 79 ] [ 81 ]
Outside of the U.S. , there are plenty of modern day examples of polarization in politics . A bulk of the research into global polarization comes from Europe . One example includes Pasokification in Greece . This is the trend from a shift from the center-left to a more far-left stance . Pasokification was caused by the Greek populous growing dissatisfied with the country 's centrist , left wing party and how they handled the Great Recession and the austerity measures the European Union put in place during recovery . [ 82 ] Although the shift further to the left was a massive benefits to the liberal population in Greece , the results in Greece ( as well as other nations like Germany , Sweden and Italy ) have not been able to sustain themselves . Parties who have made the shift left have recently shown a decline in the voting booths , evidence their supporters are uneasy of the future . [ 83 ]
The shift in Greece to the far-left is similar to the shift in countries like Poland , France and the U.K. to more far-right conservative positions . In those countries , there is heavy anti-Islam sentiment and the rise of populist commentary . The general population of the right in these countries tends to hold onto these more aggressive stances and pulls the parties further to the right . These stances include populist messages with Islamophobic , isolationist , and anti-LGBTQ language . [ 84 ] [ 85 ] Much of the polarization in these nations leads to either a more socialist left wing party , or more nationalist right wing party . These more polarized parties grow from the discontent of more moderate parties inability to provide progressive changes in either direction .
There have long been numerous scholarly debates that argue over the concept of political polarization , both in whether it is valid , and how it can accurately be measured . There are four primary arguments against the validity of political polarization : 1 ) Limitations of the Two-Party System , 2 ) Issue Partisanship , 3 ) Cultural Differences , and 4 ) Westernized Focuses .
By solely acknowledging voting patterns , one can not make an accurate conclusion as to the presence or absence of political polarization , because in the United States , there is a limited number of presidential candidates in the two-party system . To assume that the majority of voters are mostly or completely in agreement with the plethora of political issues within their party is a false assumption . [ 86 ] [ 11 ] [ 87 ] Despite contrary beliefs , there are many liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats in the U.S. who have differing political beliefs within their parties . However , these voters most often align with their party because of the limited choice of candidates , and to do otherwise ( i.e . vote for a third-party candidate ) is perceived as a waste of time . [ 86 ] [ 11 ]
Despite various claims that argue American society is more polarized today than leading up to the U.S. Civil War , [ 6 ] numerous scholars explain that much evidence shows there is a relatively stable public opinion on the majority of sociopolitical issues . [ 2 ] [ 17 ] [ 88 ] Where the most polarization exists , rather , is in the `` hot topic '' or `` sensitive '' issues ( e.g . abortion , gay marriage , U.S. involvement in war ) . [ 9 ] [ 89 ] Over-reliance on focusing on opinions regarding social issues to draw conclusion about political polarization is not a valid measurement to fully represent the concept . [ 3 ] [ 17 ]
In regard to views on public policies , Fiorina and Abrams ( 2008 ) found virtually no evidence of an increase in widespread political polarization over the past thirty years . Nonetheless , many scholars explain that it is not an increase in ideological coherence among individuals which separates them ; it is the partisan extremism ( i.e . Democrat v. Republican ) which eventually separates voters into one party or the other . [ 2 ] [ 90 ] [ 91 ]
Proponents of the cultural differences argument are critical of political polarization because of numerous factors , influences , and demographics . [ 38 ] [ 92 ] [ 93 ] Among voter demographic features , there is much evidence of race , sex , age , and educational attainment as being some of the main influences in voting behaviors . [ 94 ] In addition to these factors , the geographic region often plays a major role in voting behavior . [ 92 ] [ 93 ] Lastly , one 's socioeconomic status is a reliable predictor of voting behavior . [ 94 ] [ 95 ] The combination of these factors and influences compel researchers to reconsider the causes of political polarization .
Much like many academic studies , political polarization scholars often are too narrowly focused within one nation and , thus , make broad generalizations regarding the concept from a national study . To have a better picture of the presence or absence of political polarization , scholars must consider widening the scope of their studies to the international contexts . [ 96 ] [ 97 ]","In politics, polarization (or polarisation) can refer to the divergence of political attitudes to ideological extremes.[1][2][3] Almost all discussions of polarization in political science consider polarization in the context of political parties and democratic systems of government. When polarization occurs in a two-party system, like the United States, moderate voices often lose power and influence.[1][4][5]

Definitions and measurements [ edit ]

Political polarization refers to the cases in which an individual's stance on a given issue, policy, or person is more likely to be strictly defined by their identification with a particular political party (e.g., Democrat or Republican) or ideology (e.g., liberal or conservative).[1][2][3][6][7] According to DiMaggio et al. (1996), ""Polarization is both a state and a process. Polarization as a state refers to the extent to which opinions on an issue are opposed in relation to some theoretical maximum. Polarization as a process refers to the increase in such opposition over time.""[1] Some political scientists argue that polarization requires divergence on a broad range of issues based on a consistent set of beliefs.[1][3] Others argue polarization occurs when there are stark partisan or ideological divides, even if the opinion is polarized only on a few issues.[2][6][7]

Political scientists typically distinguish between two types of political polarization: elite polarization and popular polarization. ""Elite polarization"" refers to the polarization of political elites, like party organizers and elected officials, while ""popular polarization"" (or mass polarization) refers to the polarization in the electorate and general public. In either context, opinions and policy positions are characterized by strict adherence to party lines. Elite polarization and popular polarization can occur at the same time or independent of each other. A central issue in the study of political polarization is investigating the relationship between elite polarization and popular polarization, particularly any causal relationships between the two.[3][5][8][9][10]

Elite polarization [ edit ]

Political polarization in the United States House of Representatives (DW-Nominate scores)

Elite polarization refers to polarization in the party-in-government and party-as-organization.[2] It occurs when party members (both elected government officials and activists within the party organization itself) grow more internally homogenous on policy positions and more divergent relative to members of other parties. Polarized political parties are internally cohesive, unified, programmatic, and ideologically distinct; they are typically found in a parliamentary system of democratic governance.[4][5][9][10]

In a two-party system like the U.S., a polarized legislature has two important characteristics: first, there is little-to-no ideological overlap between members of the two parties; and second, almost all conflict over legislation and policies is split across the broad liberal/conservative ideological divide. This leads to the conflation of political parties and ideologies (i.e., Democrat and Republican become nearly perfect synonyms for liberal and conservative) and the collapse of the ideological center.[4][5][9][10]

The vast majority of studies on elite polarization focus on legislative and deliberative bodies. For many years, political scientists measured polarization by examining the ratings of party members published by interest groups, but now, most analyze roll-call voting patterns to determine trends in party-line voting and party unity.[11][12] Many political scientists studying American politics rely on Poole and Rosenthal's DW-NOMINATE scores, which assign a single liberal-conservative score to each congressperson, enabling comparisons of members from different Congresses. There is much more research on polarization in Congress than on polarization in the other branches of government or in state governments.[12][13][9] Azzimonti's political polarization index is more comprehensive instead because it is based on media coverage of newspaper articles reporting political disagreement about policy in all branches of government.[14] Recent work by Gentzkow, Shapiro, and Taddy has used the text of the Congressional Record to document differences in speech patterns between Republicans and Democrats as a measure of polarization. They find that polarization has increased dramatically since 1994.[15]

Popular polarization [ edit ]

Popular polarization, or mass polarization, occurs when the electorate's attitudes towards political issues, policies, and people are starkly divided along partisan lines. Members of the electorate and general public typically become less moderate in cases of popular polarization.[5][9][10][16] In the U.S., media accounts typically simplify popular polarization to a divide between red states and blue states or a ""culture war"" between values-voters and progressives. Political scientists, though, generally agree that such accounts are too simplistic and ignore the complex factors that can account for polarization.[9][17] Many political scientists consider political polarization a top-down process, in which elite polarization leads to – or at least precedes – popular polarization. [18] However, polarization among elites does not necessarily produce polarization within the electorate, and polarized electoral choices can often reflect elite polarization rather than voters' preferences.[3][5][8][10][16]

Political scientists studying popular polarization typically rely on data from opinion polls and election surveys. They look for trends in respondents' opinions on a given issue, their voting history, and their political ideology (conservative, liberal, moderate, etc.), and they try to relate those trends to respondents' party identification and other potentially polarizing factors (like geographic location or income bracket).[1][8] Political scientists typically limit their inquiry to issues and questions that have been constant over time, in order to compare the present day to what the political climate has historically been.[16] Oft-cited public opinion polls in the U.S. include those run by the Pew Research Center and Gallup, Inc., while political scientists also rely on more academic surveys, like the General Social Survey and the election surveys and ""feeling thermometer"" polls conducted by National Election Studies.[3][9][10][16]

Causes [ edit ]

There are various causes of political polarization and these include political parties, redistricting, the public's political ideology, and the mass media.

Party polarization [ edit ]

Some scholars argue that diverging parties has been one of the major driving forces of polarization as policy platforms have become more distant. This theory is based on recent trends in the United States Congress, where the majority party prioritizes the positions that are most aligned with its party platform and political ideology.[19] The adoption of more ideologically distinct positions by political parties can cause polarization among both elites and the electorate. For example, after the passage of the Voting Rights Act, the number of conservative Democrats in Congress decreased, while the number of conservative Republicans increased. Within the electorate during the 1970s, Southern Democrats shifted toward the Republican Party, showing polarization among both the elites and the electorate of both main parties.[4][20][21]

Political scientists have shown politicians have an incentive to advance and support polarized positions.[22] These argue that during the early 1990s, the Republican Party used polarizing tactics to become the majority party in the United States House of Representatives—which political scientists Thomas E. Mann and Norman Ornstein refer to as Newt Gingrich's ""guerrilla war.""[4] What political scientists have found is that moderates are less likely to run than are candidates who are in line with party doctrine, otherwise known as ""party fit.""[23]Other theories state politicians who cater to more extreme groups within their party tend to be more successful, helping them stay in office while simultaneously pulling their constituency toward a polar extreme.[24] A study by Nicholson (2012) found voters are more polarized by contentious statements from leaders of the opposing party than from the leaders of their own party. As a result, political leaders may be more likely to take polarized stances.[25]

With regards to multiparty systems, Giovanni Sartori (1966, 1976) claims the splitting of ideologies in the public constituency causes further divides within the political parties of the countries. He theorizes that the extremism of public ideological movement is the basis for the creation of highly polarized multiparty systems. Sartori named this polarizing phenomenon polarized pluralism and claimed it would lead to further polarization in many opposing directions (as opposed to in simply two directions, as in a polarized two-party system) over policy issues.[26][27][28] Polarization in multiparty systems can also be defined along two ideological extremes, like in the case of India in the 1970s. Ideological splits within a number of India's major parties resulted in two polarized coalitions on the right and left, each consisting of multiple political parties.[29]

Political fund-raisers and donors can also exert significant influence and control over legislators. Party leaders are expected to be productive fund-raisers, in order to support the party's campaigns. After Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, special interests in the U.S. were able to greatly impact elections through increased undisclosed spending, notably through Super political action committees. Some, such as Washington Post opinion writer Robert Kaiser, argued this allowed wealthy people, corporations, unions, and other groups to push the parties' policy platforms toward ideological extremes, resulting in a state of greater polarization.[4][30] Other scholars, such as Raymond J. La Raja and David L. Wiltse, note that this does not necessarily hold true for mass donors to political campaigns. These scholars argue a single donor who is polarized and contributes large sums to a campaign does not seem to usually drive a politician toward political extremes.[31][32]

The public [ edit ]

In democracies and other representative governments, citizens vote for the political actors who will represent them. Some scholars argue that political polarization reflects the public's ideology and voting preferences.[21][33][34][35] Dixit and Weibull (2007) claim that political polarization is a natural and regular phenomenon. They argue that there is a link between public differences in ideology and the polarization of representatives, but that an increase in preference differences is usually temporary and ultimately results in compromise.[36]

Morris P. Fiorina (2006, 2008) posits the hypothesis that polarization is a phenomenon which does not hold for the public, and instead is formulated by commentators to draw further division in government.[3][17][37] Other studies indicate that cultural differences focusing on ideological movements and geographical polarization within the United States constituency is correlated with rises in overall political polarization between 1972 and 2004.[6][38]

Religious, ethnic, and other cultural divides within the public have often influenced the emergence of polarization. According to Layman et al. (2005), the ideological split between U.S. Republicans and Democrats also crosses into the religious cultural divide. They claim that Democrats have generally become more moderate in religious views whereas Republicans have become more traditionalist. For example, political scientists have shown that in the United States, voters who identify as Republican are more likely to vote for a strongly evangelical candidate than Democratic voters.[39] This correlates with the rise in polarization in the United States.[40] Another theory contends that religion does not contribute to full-group polarization, but rather, coalition and party activist polarization causes party shifts toward a political extreme.[41]

In some post-colonial countries, the public may be polarized along ethnic divides that remain from the colonial regime.[42] In South Africa in the late 1980s, members of the conservative, pro-apartheid National Party of South Africa were no longer supportive of apartheid, and, therefore, no longer ideologically aligned with their party. Dutch Afrikaners, white English, and native Africans split based on racial divisions, causing polarization along ethnic lines.[43][44]

Economic inequality can also motivate the polarization of the public. For example, in post-World War I Germany, the Communist Workers Party, and the National Socialists, a fascist party, emerged as the dominant political ideologies and proposed to address Germany's economic problems in drastically different ways.[26][27] In Venezuela in the late 20th century, the entrance of the oil industry into the local economy caused economic disparities that led to sharp ideological divides. As a result, the disenfranchised working class aligned with extreme socialist leader Hugo Chávez.[45]

Redistricting [ edit ]

The impact of redistricting--potentially through Gerrymandering or the manipulation of electoral borders to favor a political party--on political polarization in the United States has been found to be minimal in research by leading political scientists. The logic for this minimal effect is twofold: first, gerrymandering is typically accomplished by packing opposition voters into a minority of congressional districts in a region, while distributing the preferred party's voters over a majority of districts by a slimmer majority than otherwise would have existed. The result of this is that the number of competitive congressional districts would be expected to increase, and in competitive districts representatives have to compete with the other party for the median voter, who tends to be more ideologically moderate. Second, political polarization has also occurred in the Senate, which does not experience redistricting because Senators represent fixed geographical units, i.e. states. [46][47] The argument that redistricting, through gerrymandering, would contribute to political polarization is based on the idea that new non-competitive districts created would lead to the election of extremist candidates representing the supermajority party, with no accountability to the voice of the minority. One difficulty in testing this hypothesis is to disentangle gerrymandering effects from natural geographical sorting through individuals moving to congressional districts with a similar ideological makeup to their own. Carson et al. (2007), has found that redistricting has contributed to the greater level of polarization in the House of Representatives than in the Senate, however that this effect has been ""relatively modest"". [48] Politically motivated redistricting has been associated with the rise in partisanship in the U.S. House of Representatives between 1992 and 1994.[49][50]

The media [ edit ]

The mass media has grown as an institution over the past half-century. Political scientists argue that this has particularly affected the voting public in the last three decades, as previously less partisan viewers are given more polarized news media choices. The mass media's current, fragmented, high-choice environment has induced a movement of the audience from more even-toned political programming to more antagonistic and one-sided broadcasts and articles. These programs tend to appeal to partisan viewers who watch the polarized programming as a self-confirming source for their ideologies.[4][8][51] Countries with less diversified but emerging media markets, such as China and South Korea, have become more polarized due to the diversification of political media.[52][53] In addition, most search engines and social networks (e.g., Google, Facebook) now utilize computer algorithms as filters, which personalize web content based on a user's search history, location, and previous clicking patterns, creating more polarized access to information.[54] This method of personalizing web content results in filter bubbles, a term coined by digital activist Eli Pariser that refers to the polarized ideological bubbles that are created by computer algorithms filtering out unrelated information and opposing views.[55]

A 2011 study found ideological segregation of online news consumption is lower than the segregation of most offline news consumption and lower than the segregation of face-to-face interactions.[56] This suggests that the filter bubbles effects of online media consumption are exaggerated. Other research also shows that online media does not contribute to the increased polarization of opinions.[57]

A 2017 study found that providing people with impartial, objective information has the potential to reduce political polarization, but the effect of information on polarization is highly sensitive to contextual factors. [58] Specifically, polarization over government spending was reduced when people were provided with a ""Taxpayer Receipt,"" but not when they were also asked how they wanted the money to be spent. This suggests that subtle factors like the mood and tone of partisan news sources may have a large effect on how the same information is interpreted.

Effects [ edit ]

The implications of political polarization ""are not entirely clear and may include some benefits as well as detrimental consequences.""[59] While its exact effects are disputed, it clearly alters the political process and the political composition of the general public.[3][6][60][61] Solomon Messing and Sean J. Westwood state that individuals do not necessarily become polarized through media because they choose their own exposure, which tends to already align with their views.[62]

United States Congress [ edit ]

Negative effects of polarization on the United States Congress include increased gridlock and partisanship at the cost of quality and quantity of passed legislation.[59][63][64][65][66] It also incentivizes stall tactics and closed rules, such as filibusters on non-contentious issues and excluding minority party members from committee deliberations.[4][59][67] These strategies hamper transparency, oversight, and the government's ability to handle long-term domestic issues, especially those regarding the distribution of benefits.[63] Further, they foster animosity, as majority parties lose bipartisan and legislative coordination trying to expedite legislation to overcome them.[4][66]

Some scholars claim that political polarization is not so pervasive or destructive in influence, contending that partisan agreement is the historical trend in Congress and still frequent in the modern era, including on bills of political importance.[68][69][70] Some studies have found approximately 80% of House bills passed in the modern era to have had support from both parties.[68]

The public [ edit ]

Opinions on polarization's effects on the public are mixed. Some argue that the growing polarization in government has directly contributed to political polarization in the electorate,[9] but this is not unanimous.[68][71]

Some scholars argue that polarization lowers public interest in politics, party identification and voter turnout.[9] It encourages confrontational dynamics between parties that can lower overall public trust and approval in government.[72], and causes the public to perceive the general political debate as less civil,[9][63] which can alienate voters. More polarized candidates, especially when voters aren't aware of the increase, also tend to be less representative of the public's wishes.[9][63][72]

On the other hand, others assert that elite polarization has galvanized the public's political participation in the United States, citing greater voting and nonvoting participation, engagement and investment in campaigns, and increased positive attitude toward government responsiveness.[72][73] Polarized parties become more ideologically unified, furthering voter knowledge about their positions and increasing their standard to similarly-aligned voters.[9][73]

The media [ edit ]

As Mann and Ornstein argue, political polarization and the proliferation of media sources have ""reinforce[d] tribal divisions, while enhancing a climate where facts are no longer driving the debate and deliberation, nor are they shared by the larger public.""[4] As other scholars have argued, the media often support and provoke the stall and closed rules tactics that disrupt regular policy procedure.[4][74]

While the media are not immune to general public opinion and reduced polarization allows them to appeal to a larger audience,[75] polarized environments make it easier for the media and interest groups to hold elected officials more accountable for their policy promises and positions,[59][74] generally healthy for democracy.[59]

Judicial systems [ edit ]

Judicial systems can also be affected by the implications of political polarization. For the United States, in particular, polarization lowers confirmation rates of judges;[67] In 2012, the confirmation rate of presidential circuit court appointments was approximately 50% as opposed to the above 90% rate in the late 1970s and early 1980s.[4] More polarized parties have more aggressively blocked nominees and used tactics to hinder executive agendas.[67][76] Political scientist Sarah Binder (2000) argues that ""senatorial intolerance for the opposing party’s nominees is itself a function of polarization.""[67] Negative consequences of this include higher vacancy rates on appellate courts, longer case-processing times and increased caseloads for judges.[4][65][67]

Political scientists argue that in highly polarized periods, nominees become less reflective of the moderate voter as ""polarization impacts the appointment and ideological tenor of new federal judges.""[67] It also influences the politics of senatorial advice and consent, giving partisan presidents the power to appoint judges far to the left or right of center on the federal bench, obstructing the legitimacy of the judicial branch.[65][67]

Ultimately, the increasing presence of ideology in a judicial system impacts the judiciary's credibility.[59] Polarization can generate strong partisan critiques of federal judges, which can damage the public perception of the justice system and the legitimacy of the courts as nonpartisan legal arbiters.[67][77]

Foreign policy [ edit ]

Political polarization can undercut unified agreement on foreign policy and harm a nation's international standing;[59][78] divisiveness on foreign affairs strengthens enemies, discourages allies and destabilize a nation's determination.[59]

Political scientists point to two primary implications of polarization with regards to the foreign policy of the United States"". First, when the United States conducts relations abroad and appears divided, allies are less likely to trust its promises, enemies are more likely to predict its weaknesses, and uncertainty as to the country's position in world affairs rises.[78][79][80] Second, elite opinion has a significant impact on the public's perception and understanding of foreign policy,[79] a field where Americans have less prior knowledge to rely on.[78][79][81]

Global Perspective [ edit ]

Outside of the U.S., there are plenty of modern day examples of polarization in politics. A bulk of the research into global polarization comes from Europe. One example includes Pasokification in Greece. This is the trend from a shift from the center-left to a more far-left stance. Pasokification was caused by the Greek populous growing dissatisfied with the country's centrist, left wing party and how they handled the Great Recession and the austerity measures the European Union put in place during recovery.[82] Although the shift further to the left was a massive benefits to the liberal population in Greece, the results in Greece (as well as other nations like Germany, Sweden and Italy) have not been able to sustain themselves. Parties who have made the shift left have recently shown a decline in the voting booths, evidence their supporters are uneasy of the future.[83]

The shift in Greece to the far-left is similar to the shift in countries like Poland, France and the U.K. to more far-right conservative positions. In those countries, there is heavy anti-Islam sentiment and the rise of populist commentary. The general population of the right in these countries tends to hold onto these more aggressive stances and pulls the parties further to the right. These stances include populist messages with Islamophobic, isolationist, and anti-LGBTQ language.[84][85] Much of the polarization in these nations leads to either a more socialist left wing party, or more nationalist right wing party. These more polarized parties grow from the discontent of more moderate parties inability to provide progressive changes in either direction.

Critiques [ edit ]

There have long been numerous scholarly debates that argue over the concept of political polarization, both in whether it is valid, and how it can accurately be measured. There are four primary arguments against the validity of political polarization: 1) Limitations of the Two-Party System, 2) Issue Partisanship, 3) Cultural Differences, and 4) Westernized Focuses.

Limitations of the two-party system [ edit ]

By solely acknowledging voting patterns, one cannot make an accurate conclusion as to the presence or absence of political polarization, because in the United States, there is a limited number of presidential candidates in the two-party system. To assume that the majority of voters are mostly or completely in agreement with the plethora of political issues within their party is a false assumption.[86][11][87] Despite contrary beliefs, there are many liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats in the U.S. who have differing political beliefs within their parties. However, these voters most often align with their party because of the limited choice of candidates, and to do otherwise (i.e. vote for a third-party candidate) is perceived as a waste of time.[86][11]

Issue partisanship [ edit ]

Despite various claims that argue American society is more polarized today than leading up to the U.S. Civil War,[6] numerous scholars explain that much evidence shows there is a relatively stable public opinion on the majority of sociopolitical issues.[2][17][88] Where the most polarization exists, rather, is in the ""hot topic"" or ""sensitive"" issues (e.g. abortion, gay marriage, U.S. involvement in war).[9][89] Over-reliance on focusing on opinions regarding social issues to draw conclusion about political polarization is not a valid measurement to fully represent the concept.[3][17]

In regard to views on public policies, Fiorina and Abrams (2008) found virtually no evidence of an increase in widespread political polarization over the past thirty years. Nonetheless, many scholars explain that it is not an increase in ideological coherence among individuals which separates them; it is the partisan extremism (i.e. Democrat v. Republican) which eventually separates voters into one party or the other.[2][90][91]

Cultural differences [ edit ]

Proponents of the cultural differences argument are critical of political polarization because of numerous factors, influences, and demographics.[38][92][93] Among voter demographic features, there is much evidence of race, sex, age, and educational attainment as being some of the main influences in voting behaviors.[94] In addition to these factors, the geographic region often plays a major role in voting behavior.[92][93] Lastly, one's socioeconomic status is a reliable predictor of voting behavior.[94][95] The combination of these factors and influences compel researchers to reconsider the causes of political polarization.

Westernized focus [ edit ]

Much like many academic studies, political polarization scholars often are too narrowly focused within one nation and, thus, make broad generalizations regarding the concept from a national study. To have a better picture of the presence or absence of political polarization, scholars must consider widening the scope of their studies to the international contexts.[96][97]

Here's how we can do it.",2020-03-20,,"Something extraordinary happened in the Middle East . In the wake of this global pandemic , Palestinians and Israelis put aside their differences and pledged to work together to stop the spread of COVID-19 .
It should be a lesson to all of us : if these two adversaries can find a way to stop fighting , why can ’ t Americans ?
Crises have a way of bringing us together but , unfortunately , partisanship is alive and well in the United States . A recent Reuters poll found that four in 10 Democrats view the pandemic as a threat while just two in 10 Republicans agree . Meanwhile , a Quinnipiac poll found similarly sharp divides when it came to the president ’ s coronavirus response .
To be sure , collaboration hasn ’ t been nonexistent . House Democrats and Republicans came together to pass a financial aid bill that awaits consideration in the Senate and there appears to be bipartisan support for sending stimulus money to Americans . But too many pundits and politicians are still using COVID-19 as an excuse to push partisan politics .
Legitimate concerns have been raised about how the Trump administration has handled the response to COVID-19 but telling the president that he needs to “ shut up ” only serves to inflame an already tense situation . Likewise , calling Vice President Joe Biden a “ rotting corpse ” is the kind of juvenile name-calling that has no place in government during a time of national crisis .
Shared humanity is what brought Palestinians and Israelis together and it can do the same for us . We lead an organization , Common Ground Committee , dedicated to highlighting what brings us together . Here are attributes Americans — from the halls of Congress to newsrooms to the streets of our cities and towns — should adopt in discussions about COVID-19 to focus our efforts on getting through this challenge .
According to the World Health Organization , there is about 142 times more disinformation about COVID-19 than there is legitimate information . Much of that comes from erroneous social media posts , but it ’ s also a reminder that we need to leave our media echo chambers .
According to Pew , Republicans were more likely to trust Fox News than any other media source , while Democrats gravitated toward CNN and MSNBC . At a recent Common Ground Committee forum , we brought together Fox News ’ Chris Wallace and The New York Times ’ Maggie Haberman .

Something extraordinary happened in the Middle East. In the wake of this global pandemic, Palestinians and Israelis put aside their differences and pledged to work together to stop the spread of COVID-19.

It should be a lesson to all of us: if these two adversaries can find a way to stop fighting, why can’t Americans?

Crises have a way of bringing us together but, unfortunately, partisanship is alive and well in the United States. A recent Reuters poll found that four in 10 Democrats view the pandemic as a threat while just two in 10 Republicans agree. Meanwhile, a Quinnipiac poll found similarly sharp divides when it came to the president’s coronavirus response.

To be sure, collaboration hasn’t been nonexistent. House Democrats and Republicans came together to pass a financial aid bill that awaits consideration in the Senate and there appears to be bipartisan support for sending stimulus money to Americans. But too many pundits and politicians are still using COVID-19 as an excuse to push partisan politics.

Legitimate concerns have been raised about how the Trump administration has handled the response to COVID-19 but telling the president that he needs to “shut up” only serves to inflame an already tense situation. Likewise, calling Vice President Joe Biden a “rotting corpse” is the kind of juvenile name-calling that has no place in government during a time of national crisis.

Shared humanity is what brought Palestinians and Israelis together and it can do the same for us. We lead an organization, Common Ground Committee, dedicated to highlighting what brings us together. Here are attributes Americans — from the halls of Congress to newsrooms to the streets of our cities and towns — should adopt in discussions about COVID-19 to focus our efforts on getting through this challenge.

Use and accept facts

According to the World Health Organization, there is about 142 times more disinformation about COVID-19 than there is legitimate information. Much of that comes from erroneous social media posts, but it’s also a reminder that we need to leave our media echo chambers.

According to Pew, Republicans were more likely to trust Fox News than any other media source, while Democrats gravitated toward CNN and MSNBC. At a recent Common Ground Committee forum, we brought together Fox News’ Chris Wallace and The New York Times’ Maggie Haberman. One of the most important points they agreed on was the need to improve our media literacy.

Talking it out:Learning to discuss complicated issues ahead of the election

We want to hear from you: Be a part of the solution to finding solutions. Tell us here.

As information about COVID-19 spreads, consider the source of any information you share. Make sure it is sourced from a recognized authority such as WHO rather than someone with an agenda.

Commit to seek agreement, solutions

In times like these we must shelve ideological battles and focus on solving the problem. Approach discussions about coronavirus with an objective of trying to agree on how we can best solve the crisis and make the mental commitment not to push a partisan agenda. That’s what past members of the Trump and Obama administrations did when they came together to call for the government to increase the federal Medicaid matching rate.

We’re not going to agree on everything. Nor should we. But political objectives should not be a barrier to obtaining and sharing accurate information, and productive debate, especially when Americans are looking to their leaders for stability and solutions.

Identify and set aside personal biases

We all carry personal beliefs, biases and opinions. As conversations about the outbreak continue, be aware of yours. Be willing to test them against new information and recognize when they may be closing your thoughts to other views. Most important, be respectful of people’s fears and concerns, even if you don’t agree they are merited.

If you have a friend or family member concerned by the administration’s response to COVID-19 your first instinct should not be to lash out because you agree with the president. Instead, take the time to understand why they are concerned. You may not ultimately agree, but you will both better understand each other’s perspectives and thereby help each other make better decisions in this uncertain environment.

If two peoples who have a history as violent as Palestinians and Israelis can find a way to put their differences aside, there is no reason we can’t do the same. Agreeing on bipartisan legislation was a great first step. Now we need to put political views and objectives on the backburner and focus on doing what is necessary to help ourselves and others successfully make it through this pandemic.

We all can do this. Let’s make a pledge, across the political spectrum, to drop political agendas and work together.

`` Matthew Horn , a software engineer from Boulder , Colo. , canceled Christmas plans with his family in Texas .

A number of people who voted for Trump called my show to tell me that their daughters had informed them that they would no longer allow their parents to see their grandchildren . And one man sent me an email reporting that his brother-in-law 's mother told him that she `` no longer had a son . ''
All of this raises an obvious question : Why is this phenomenon of cutting off contact with friends and relatives so one-sided ? Why do n't we hear about conservatives shunning friends and relatives who supported Hillary Clinton ? After all , almost every conservative considered Clinton to be ethically and morally challenged . And most believed that another four years of left-wing rule would complete what Barack Obama promised he would do in 2008 if he were elected president -- `` fundamentally ( transform ) the United States of America . ''
In other words , conservatives were not one whit less fearful of Clinton and the Democrats than Democrats were of Trump and Republicans .
Yet virtually no conservatives cut off contact with friends , let alone parents , who supported Clinton .
Here are 10 reasons left-wingers cut Trump voters from their lives .
1 . Just like our universities shut out conservative ideas and speakers , more and more individuals on the left now shut out conservative friends and relatives as well as conservative ideas .
2 . Many , if not most , leftists have been indoctrinated with leftism their entire lives .

3 . Most left-wing positions are emotion-based . That 's a major reason people who hold leftist views will sever relations with people they previously cared for or even loved . Their emotions ( in this case , irrational fear and hatred ) simply overwhelm them .
4 . Since Karl Marx , leftists have loved ideas more than people . All Trump voters who have been cut off by children , in-laws and lifelong friends now know how true that is .
5 . People on the right think that most people on the left are wrong ; people on the left think that most people on the right are evil . Decades of labeling conservative positions as `` hateful '' and labeling conservative individuals as `` sexist , '' `` intolerant , '' `` xenophobic , '' `` homophobic , '' `` racist '' and `` bigoted '' have had their desired effect .
6 . The left associates human decency not so much with personal integrity as with having correct -- i.e . progressive -- political positions . Therefore , if you do n't hold progressive positions , you lack decency . Ask your left-wing friends if they 'd rather their high school son or daughter cheat on tests or support Trump .
7 . Most individuals on the left are irreligious , so the commandment `` Honor your father and your mother '' means nothing to those who have cut off relations with parents because they voted for Trump .
8 . Unlike conservatives , politics gives most leftists ' lives meaning . Climate change is a good example . For leftists , fighting carbon emissions means saving human existence on Earth . Now , how often does anyone get a chance to literally save the world ?

Many Hillary Clinton voters have ceased communicating with friends, and even family members, who voted for Donald Trump. It is so common that The New York Times published a front-page article on the subject headlined, ""Political Divide Splits Relationships -- and Thanksgiving, Too.""

The article begins with three stories:

""Matthew Horn, a software engineer from Boulder, Colo., canceled Christmas plans with his family in Texas. Nancy Sundin, a social worker in Spokane, Wash., has called off Thanksgiving with her mother and brother. Ruth Dorancy, a software designer in Chicago, decided to move her wedding so that her fiancé's grandmother and aunt, strong Trump supporters from Florida, could not attend.""

The Times acknowledges that this phenomenon is one-sided, saying, ""Democrats have dug in their heels, and in some cases are refusing to sit across the table from relatives who voted for President-elect Donald J. Trump.""

A number of people who voted for Trump called my show to tell me that their daughters had informed them that they would no longer allow their parents to see their grandchildren. And one man sent me an email reporting that his brother-in-law's mother told him that she ""no longer had a son.""

All of this raises an obvious question: Why is this phenomenon of cutting off contact with friends and relatives so one-sided? Why don't we hear about conservatives shunning friends and relatives who supported Hillary Clinton? After all, almost every conservative considered Clinton to be ethically and morally challenged. And most believed that another four years of left-wing rule would complete what Barack Obama promised he would do in 2008 if he were elected president -- ""fundamentally (transform) the United States of America.""

In other words, conservatives were not one whit less fearful of Clinton and the Democrats than Democrats were of Trump and Republicans.

Yet virtually no conservatives cut off contact with friends, let alone parents, who supported Clinton.

Here are 10 reasons left-wingers cut Trump voters from their lives.

1. Just like our universities shut out conservative ideas and speakers, more and more individuals on the left now shut out conservative friends and relatives as well as conservative ideas.

2. Many, if not most, leftists have been indoctrinated with leftism their entire lives.

This is easily shown.

There are far more conservatives who read articles, listen to and watch broadcasts of the left and have studied under left-wing teachers than there are people on the left who have read, listened to or watched anything of the right or taken classes with conservative instructors.

As a result, those on the left really believe that those on the right are all SIXHIRB: sexist, intolerant, xenophobic, homophobic, Islamophobic, racist and bigoted. Not to mention misogynistic and transphobic.

3. Most left-wing positions are emotion-based. That's a major reason people who hold leftist views will sever relations with people they previously cared for or even loved. Their emotions (in this case, irrational fear and hatred) simply overwhelm them.

4. Since Karl Marx, leftists have loved ideas more than people. All Trump voters who have been cut off by children, in-laws and lifelong friends now know how true that is.

5. People on the right think that most people on the left are wrong; people on the left think that most people on the right are evil. Decades of labeling conservative positions as ""hateful"" and labeling conservative individuals as ""sexist,"" ""intolerant,"" ""xenophobic,"" ""homophobic,"" ""racist"" and ""bigoted"" have had their desired effect.

6. The left associates human decency not so much with personal integrity as with having correct -- i.e. progressive -- political positions. Therefore, if you don't hold progressive positions, you lack decency. Ask your left-wing friends if they'd rather their high school son or daughter cheat on tests or support Trump.

7. Most individuals on the left are irreligious, so the commandment ""Honor your father and your mother"" means nothing to those who have cut off relations with parents because they voted for Trump.

8. Unlike conservatives, politics gives most leftists' lives meaning. Climate change is a good example. For leftists, fighting carbon emissions means saving human existence on Earth. Now, how often does anyone get a chance to literally save the world? Therefore, to most leftists, if you voted for Trump, you have both negated their reason for living and are literally destroying planet Earth. Why would they have Thanksgiving or Christmas with such a person?

9. The left tends toward the totalitarian. And every totalitarian ideology seeks to weaken the bonds between children and parents. The left seeks to dilute parental authority and replace it with school authority and government authority. So when your children sever their bond with you because you voted for Trump, they are acting like the good totalitarians the left has molded.

10. While there are kind and mean individuals on both sides of the political spectrum, as a result of all of the above, there are more mean people on the left than on the right. What other word than ""mean"" would anyone use to describe a daughter who banished her parents from their grandchildren's lives because of their vote?

I wish none of this were true. But there is a way to prove me wrong: Re-friend your friends and relatives who voted for Trump, and tell everyone who has ended relations with family members -- especially with parents -- to reach out to them and welcome them back into their lives.

I know people don ’ t like to use those terms . But I think it ’ s scary . ”
Mrs. O ’ Connell is a registered Democrat . She voted for Bill Clinton twice . But she has drifted away from the party over what she said was a move from its middle-class economic roots toward identity politics . She remembers Mr. Clinton giving a speech about the dangers of illegal immigration . Mr. Trump was lambasted for offering some of the same ideas , she said .
“ The Democratic Party has changed so much that I don ’ t even recognize it anymore , ” she said . “ These people are destroying our democracy . They are scarier to me than these Islamic terrorists . I feel absolutely disgusted with them and their antics . It strengthens people ’ s resolve in wanting to support President Trump . It really does . ”

I know people don’t like to use those terms. But I think it’s scary.”

Mrs. O’Connell is a registered Democrat. She voted for Bill Clinton twice. But she has drifted away from the party over what she said was a move from its middle-class economic roots toward identity politics. She remembers Mr. Clinton giving a speech about the dangers of illegal immigration. Mr. Trump was lambasted for offering some of the same ideas, she said.

“The Democratic Party has changed so much that I don’t even recognize it anymore,” she said. “These people are destroying our democracy. They are scarier to me than these Islamic terrorists. I feel absolutely disgusted with them and their antics. It strengthens people’s resolve in wanting to support President Trump. It really does.”

Mr. Medford compares Mr. Trump to a jalopy.

“It’s like I need to get from Charleston to Atlanta, and suddenly the most beat-up car on earth shows up and says, ‘Do you need a ride?’ I think, wow, if I had any other way to get there, I’d choose it. But there’s only this terrible car. And it might not even make it.”

Amid disturbing reports that explosive devices were sent to some of the president's top political enemies by one or more unknown persons, Trump’s critics say he has a reckless penchant for, at a minimum, celebrating violence against his enemies — and, at worst, inciting it.

“ It ’ s one of the few regrets of my presidency , ” he said , “ that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better . ”
He shouldn ’ t be too hard on himself , in my view . When it comes to stirring “ rancor and suspicion , ” he had plenty of assistance from his stubbornly resistant conservative adversaries .
I am not one to complain , as many Obama supporters do , that the nation ’ s first black president has had a rougher road than any previous president . Who can forget the blizzard of allegations , myths and rumors that were showered on Bill and Hillary Clinton during his presidency ?
Expect more of the same if his wife is nominated for the presidency this year , as expected .
Obama should have expected no less , as I wrote at the time of his first inaugural : Nobody promised him a rose garden , except for the big official one behind the White House .
Sure , both parties try to block their rivals ’ agendas . That ’ s politics .
But as Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein point out in their book , “ It ’ s Even Worse than It Looks : How the American Constitutional System Collided with the New Politics of Extremism , ” there has been a glaring difference in recent years in Congress .
While today ’ s congressional Democrats will boast about their ability to work with Republicans to get things done , Mann and Ornstein point out , Republicans who work across the aisle risk condemnation and even primary election challenges from fellow Republicans .
The result has been gridlock , shutdowns , saber rattling and brinkmanship , emboldened by a Republican race to the farthest-right positions .
Small wonder , then , that Obama called for an end to gerrymandering , a system that , as Obama said , draws “ congressional districts so that politicians can pick their voters and not the other way around . ”
Nevertheless , Obama ’ s own rise benefited from a gerrymander in the Illinois Senate , as Ryan Lizza chronicled in The New Yorker in 2008 . Political scientists also disagree on how much gerrymandering contributes to polarization compared to other factors .
Obama also called for campaign-finance reform , even though he made the reforms passed after the Watergate scandal obsolete in 2008 when he raised more money over the Internet than he would have been allowed had he accepted federal matching funds .
The fact is Obama , burdened by the triple-header of two wars and a recession , never got anything resembling a break from conservative Republicans .
Quite the opposite : A Tea Party movement that long had been a small , easily ignored rump group suddenly exploded in national growth , prominence and influence .
Was that Obama ’ s fault ? Has his presidency actually made relations between the races and other groups more angry than before ? Or is it that having a black president makes some people , as Obama in his second memoir quotes an unnamed Illinois politician state senator as putting it , “ feel more white ? ”
I suspect the latter . Yes , Obama might have done more to reach out to his opposition . He had more of a chance before Democrats lost control of both houses of Congress .
But , as the president said , he can not heal the divide alone . The rest of us have to do our part .
In that sense , I admire the other most-quoted speech of the evening , the Republican response by South Carolina governor Nikki Haley . She took a lot of heat from fellow Republicans for her not-too-subtle criticism of Republican front-runner Donald Trump , in particular , for his divisive rhetoric .
She was even called a RINO , a “ Republican in Name Only , ” for criticizing Trump , who was easily identified despite her omitting his name . Conservative columnist-author Ann Coulter even tweeted that Haley , a native-born American child of Indian Sikh parents , should be deported .
Yet , Haley set the sort of standard for civil discourse that establishment mainstream Republicans are trying , despite Trump ’ s antics , to revive .
“ Some people think that you have to be the loudest voice in the room to make a difference . That is just not true , ” she said . “ Often , the best thing we can do is turn down the volume .
“ When the sound is quieter , you can actually hear what someone else is saying . And that can make a world of difference . ”
Indeed , it can . I hope Washington tries it again soon .","Considering the stubbornness of his opposition, I thought President Barack Obama was being quite generous in expressing “regrets” over his role in Washington’s dysfunction.

“It’s one of the few regrets of my presidency,” he said, “that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better.”

He shouldn’t be too hard on himself, in my view. When it comes to stirring “rancor and suspicion,” he had plenty of assistance from his stubbornly resistant conservative adversaries.

I am not one to complain, as many Obama supporters do, that the nation’s first black president has had a rougher road than any previous president. Who can forget the blizzard of allegations, myths and rumors that were showered on Bill and Hillary Clinton during his presidency?

But as Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein point out in their book, “It’s Even Worse than It Looks: How the American Constitutional System Collided with the New Politics of Extremism,” there has been a glaring difference in recent years in Congress.

While today’s congressional Democrats will boast about their ability to work with Republicans to get things done, Mann and Ornstein point out, Republicans who work across the aisle risk condemnation and even primary election challenges from fellow Republicans.

The result has been gridlock, shutdowns, saber rattling and brinkmanship, emboldened by a Republican race to the farthest-right positions.

Small wonder, then, that Obama called for an end to gerrymandering, a system that, as Obama said, draws “congressional districts so that politicians can pick their voters and not the other way around.”

Nevertheless, Obama’s own rise benefited from a gerrymander in the Illinois Senate, as Ryan Lizza chronicled in The New Yorker in 2008. Political scientists also disagree on how much gerrymandering contributes to polarization compared to other factors.

Obama also called for campaign-finance reform, even though he made the reforms passed after the Watergate scandal obsolete in 2008 when he raised more money over the Internet than he would have been allowed had he accepted federal matching funds.

The fact is Obama, burdened by the triple-header of two wars and a recession, never got anything resembling a break from conservative Republicans.

Quite the opposite: A Tea Party movement that long had been a small, easily ignored rump group suddenly exploded in national growth, prominence and influence.

Was that Obama’s fault? Has his presidency actually made relations between the races and other groups more angry than before? Or is it that having a black president makes some people, as Obama in his second memoir quotes an unnamed Illinois politician state senator as putting it, “feel more white?”

I suspect the latter. Yes, Obama might have done more to reach out to his opposition. He had more of a chance before Democrats lost control of both houses of Congress.

But, as the president said, he cannot heal the divide alone. The rest of us have to do our part.

In that sense, I admire the other most-quoted speech of the evening, the Republican response by South Carolina governor Nikki Haley. She took a lot of heat from fellow Republicans for her not-too-subtle criticism of Republican front-runner Donald Trump, in particular, for his divisive rhetoric.

She was even called a RINO, a “Republican in Name Only,” for criticizing Trump, who was easily identified despite her omitting his name. Conservative columnist-author Ann Coulter even tweeted that Haley, a native-born American child of Indian Sikh parents, should be deported.

Yet, Haley set the sort of standard for civil discourse that establishment mainstream Republicans are trying, despite Trump’s antics, to revive.

“Some people think that you have to be the loudest voice in the room to make a difference. That is just not true,” she said. “Often, the best thing we can do is turn down the volume.

“When the sound is quieter, you can actually hear what someone else is saying. And that can make a world of difference.”

Indeed, it can. I hope Washington tries it again soon.

Apparently , the question , `` Who started it ? '' means nothing to the journalists , politicians and NFL players , coaches and owners who call the president `` divisive . ''
So , before discussing Trump 's reaction , our fellow Americans on the left need to answer some pretty simple questions : Has the behavior of those athletes has been divisive ? Is kneeling while tens of thousands of people are standing divisive ? Is publicly showing contempt for the American flag for which innumerable Americans risked their lives , were terribly injured , or died divisive ?
The answers are so obvious that if someone denies that those actions are divisive , it inevitably raises another question :
First , most people on the left think that they are centrists , or at most center-liberal . Therefore , they deem whatever they believe to be normative and deem whoever differs with them to be divisive and ultimately extremist .
This is true for every issue . Take same-sex marriage . Redefining marriage to include two people of the same sex was the most radical change in the history of the family -- far more radical than , say , banning polygamy .

On the contrary , people on the left believe that all those who wanted to retain the only definition of marriage any society has ever had -- the union between the two sexes -- are divisive and extremist .

Because the left dominates the news media, the entertainment media and academia, Americans are swimming -- actually, drowning -- in an ocean of lies.

Here are a few examples:

America oppresses its minorities.

America oppresses women.

Universities have a culture of rape.

There are more than two genders.

All cultures are morally and culturally equal.

Hurricanes Harvey and Irma were caused, or made more intense, by global warming.

Israel is the villain in the Middle East conflict.

Western civilization is a euphemism for ""white supremacy.""

The moment that inspired psychology professor Jeremy Frimer’s latest research happened a while back, in the middle of a casual chat with one of his colleagues, a liberal philosophy professor, about what it means to be intellectually humble.

polarization,HotAir,2,http://hotair.com/archives/2015/02/09/it-turns-out-californias-tinkering-with-elections-only-made-polarization-worse/,Shock: California’s reformers only made things worse,2015-02-09,"Noah Rothman, Jazz Shaw, Ed Morrissey, John Sexton, Karen Townsend","They say that the perfect is often the enemy of the good . In the pursuit of perfection , California ’ s fiddlers and tinkerers possessed with an outsize sense of their historical significance have gone and made an imperfect but functional system worse .
Among the historically illiterate , political partisanship and vitriol in government are not only modern phenomena , but they are also the singular obstacle preventing human progress . Adherents to a bizarre theology , which holds that political polarization today is worse than it has ever been and the people ’ s representatives in both Congress and state legislatures are uniquely dysfunctional as a result , have undertaken to incrementally remake the nation ’ s electoral system .
It is this point of view that led some states , including California , to reform the reapportionment process in the hopes of removing the influence legislators have over it . In some circles , merely invoking the term “ gerrymandering ” serves as a substitute for an argument . Many assert that the decennial process of redistricting is hopelessly corrupt , and it has led to the frustration of the public ’ s desires . Don ’ t read too much into the fact that gerrymander reform ’ s popularity coincides with the decline of the New Deal Democratic coalition .
It was not long after California reformed the redistricting process by creating a supposedly impartial independent commission to oversee it that observers learned that reapportionment was still subject to manipulation .
“ The citizens ’ commission had pledged to create districts based on testimony from the communities themselves , not from parties or statewide political players . To get around that , Democrats surreptitiously enlisted local voters , elected officials , labor unions and community groups to testify in support of configurations that coincided with the party ’ s interests , ” read a 2011 ProPublica report . “ When they appeared before the commission , those groups identified themselves as ordinary Californians and did not disclose their ties to the party . One woman who purported to represent the Asian community of the San Gabriel Valley was actually a lobbyist who grew up in rural Idaho , and lives in Sacramento . ”
Formerly popular independent redistricting commissions are under assault across the country as state-level political leaders learn that these bodies are not walled off from the interests of the legislatures they seek to remake .
Similarly , the desire to fix that which was never broken has resulted in a unique electoral reform in California : A top-two primary system in which the two candidates who receive the most votes , regardless of party affiliation , advance to the general election .

In the pursuit of perfection, California’s fiddlers and tinkerers possessed with an outsize sense of their historical significance have gone and made an imperfect but functional system worse.

Among the historically illiterate, political partisanship and vitriol in government are not only modern phenomena, but they are also the singular obstacle preventing human progress. Adherents to a bizarre theology, which holds that political polarization today is worse than it has ever been and the people’s representatives in both Congress and state legislatures are uniquely dysfunctional as a result, have undertaken to incrementally remake the nation’s electoral system.

It is this point of view that led some states, including California, to reform the reapportionment process in the hopes of removing the influence legislators have over it. In some circles, merely invoking the term “gerrymandering” serves as a substitute for an argument. Many assert that the decennial process of redistricting is hopelessly corrupt, and it has led to the frustration of the public’s desires. Don’t read too much into the fact that gerrymander reform’s popularity coincides with the decline of the New Deal Democratic coalition.

It was not long after California reformed the redistricting process by creating a supposedly impartial independent commission to oversee it that observers learned that reapportionment was still subject to manipulation.

“The citizens’ commission had pledged to create districts based on testimony from the communities themselves, not from parties or statewide political players. To get around that, Democrats surreptitiously enlisted local voters, elected officials, labor unions and community groups to testify in support of configurations that coincided with the party’s interests,” read a 2011 ProPublica report. “When they appeared before the commission, those groups identified themselves as ordinary Californians and did not disclose their ties to the party. One woman who purported to represent the Asian community of the San Gabriel Valley was actually a lobbyist who grew up in rural Idaho, and lives in Sacramento.”

Like life itself, corruption finds a way.

Formerly popular independent redistricting commissions are under assault across the country as state-level political leaders learn that these bodies are not walled off from the interests of the legislatures they seek to remake.

Similarly, the desire to fix that which was never broken has resulted in a unique electoral reform in California: A top-two primary system in which the two candidates who receive the most votes, regardless of party affiliation, advance to the general election.

“Absent the need to appease the most puritanical elements of the major parties, the thinking went, candidates would broaden their appeal to the many voters in the middle,” The Los Angeles Times reporter Mark Barabak summarized. “Voila! A more harmonious, pragmatic and productive Legislature.”

Well, something funny happened on the way to utopia.

“New academic research, published Sunday by the California Journal of Politics & Policy, found that voters were just as apt to support candidates representing the same partisan poles as they were before the election rules changed — that is, if they even bothered voting,” the report continued.

According to research published by the Institute of Governmental Studies at UC Berkeley, the new rules have not resulted in a dramatic increase in crossover voters. Fewer than 6 percent of Democrats and less than 8 percent of Republicans reportedly supported a candidate from the opposing party in the 2012 state Assembly races. Those partisans who were shut out of the general election when two Democrats or two Republicans advanced to the general election tended just to stay home on Election Day. The hapless theorists who suggested that a top-two primary system would draw in the disinterested voter were dismayed to learn that this voter continues to cling stubbornly to his disinterest. The 2014 primary in California only saw a quarter of the state’s registered voters turn out, the lowest in the state’s history.

“Proponents of the ballot measure didn’t necessarily mislead people,” Barabak concludes. “But they seem to have invested more hope than merited in the virtues of their transformative surgery.”

While this reporter correctly chides the reformers for their undue faith in their own ability to remake the American electoral system, he diagnoses the problem incorrectly. Barabak avers that this reform must “overcome” both “widespread ignorance” and “apathy among California voters” in order to be successful. This self-flattering expression of fealty to an erroneous shibboleth is precisely what gave birth to this misguided reform in the first place. Barabak had just concluded observing that voters were less apathetic in a pre-reform era and that their supposed “ignorance,” exemplified apparently in their desire to support candidates occupying the fringes of political thought, was unchanged as a result of this reform. If anything, this phenomenon was exacerbated as candidates vying for seats in partisan districts shunned unnecessary moderation in order to appeal to a smaller, more ideologically homogenous electorate.

Several of its leaders have departed under allegations of racist or misogynist behavior in the workplace .

That view has been spread via the Southern Poverty Law Center and its influential Hatewatch project .

In the past month , three key leaders have either been fired or resigned amid allegations of racism and misogyny in the workplace – an irony for an organization founded to fight those impulses .

Hints of a moral crisis in an organization founded to uphold civil rights may extend beyond the office . Critics have raised concerns that its efforts to root out extremism are , in some part , based on “ selling the idea of Southern intolerance to a do-gooder Yankee donor base ” that supports a $ 741 million trust fund , as a former SPLC staffer wrote in The New Yorker magazine .
Out of a modernist six-story edifice set against Montgomery ’ s modest skyline , the SPLC manages a platoon of lawyers to litigate civil rights complaints . A smaller group is its outward face : the Intelligence Project , widely quoted publisher of Hatewatch , which tracks extremism throughout the U.S .
SPLC ’ s bankrupting of the Ku Klux Klan has been widely reported , and the group gained still more prominence as it tracked racists and bigots from the Clinton through Obama eras .
But with the Trump election , it took on fresh stature . Last year , it helped force several conservative commentators – including conspiracy theorist Alex Jones , who is currently being sued by parents of slain Sandy Hook children for spreading conspiracy theories that their children ’ s murders were all a hoax – off mainstream social media platforms . It routinely assists law enforcement , including the FBI , in tracking hate groups , and has been ringing alarm bells about a rising tide of white nationalist violence .

In recent years , the Intelligence Project has apologized to Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson for listing him on an extremist watch . It also paid out millions in a libel settlement to a man it misidentified as an anti-Muslim extremist .
And critics have blamed the SPLC ’ s labeling as extremists mainstream figures like author Charles Murray – who posited in the “ Bell Curve ” the widely debunked theory that there may be genetic differences between the races – as contributing to hostility toward free speech on college campuses .
And then two weeks ago , a bombshell : The center suddenly announced the firing of co-founder Morris Dees . Late last month , president Richard Cohen and several other principals resigned .

Last week , the center hired Tina Tchen , Michelle Obama ’ s former chief of staff , to help overhaul its workplace culture . On Wednesday , it announced that an SPLC board member , former juvenile court judge Karen Baynes-Dunning , is taking over as interim CEO .
“ It ’ s clear that our mission and our work combating hate and extremism are as needed as ever , so the vital work of the Intelligence Project goes on , ” an SPLC spokesperson writes in an email . “ Like all parts of the SPLC , we ’ re eager to see Tina Tchen ’ s review process continue and look forward to making any changes needed to ensure we have a workplace that reflects our highest values . ”
The news led to eye-opening shellackings from news organizations that routinely use the SPLC ’ s findings to fuel stories . The Los Angeles Times and The New Yorker were among those that published tough critiques .
But a gentler charge , says Professor Stock , who teaches American studies at Connecticut College in New London , is that the SPLC applies what moral philosophers call a “ hero standard ” to group membership – the idea , for example , that those not actively trying to rescue Jews during the Holocaust were bad people . That high bar of virtue means that the SPLC ’ s brush sometimes splatters non-extremist Americans .
The organization understands that “ there is a danger labeling groups as hate groups when we ’ re in such a fragmented , polarized , and nuanced sociopolitical climate , ” said Brian Levin , former associate director for legal affairs of the SPLC ’ s Klanwatch/Militia Task Force , in a conversation before the shake-up .
But it ’ s the “ gray areas ” between free speech and violence-inspiring hatred where extremism can flourish – and where hate-watch groups can skate onto thin ice , says extremism expert J.M . Berger .
Last year , the Intelligence Project listed a man named Vince Buckles as a leader of the secessionist and increasingly militant League of the South in Louisiana . Mr. Buckles was at one point a cast member on the “ Sons of Guns ” reality TV show .
At the time , Hatewatch editor Heidi Beirich told the Monitor ’ s Christa Case Bryant that it stood by its reporting . She said Mr. Buckles “ downplayed his role ” because “ this guy had a lot to lose by the disclosure of this . I know he was at some league events . ”
Reached last year by the Monitor at his gun shop in Louisiana , Mr. Buckles acknowledged that he had been at a league event in New Orleans . But he says all he did was pay a membership fee to the League of the South .
He denies being a racist , claiming his gun shop is one of only a few in his parts of Louisiana that actively caters to a black clientele . For Mr. Buckles , at least , it ’ s like he woke up one day to find his reputation at stake for simply holding what he sees as traditional American views .
“ The growing rise of left-wing politics means that stuff that used to be center of the road is now right-wing , ” says Mr. Buckles . “ Bill Clinton ’ s policies are not that different from Trump , but Trump is a Nazi and Clinton was a Democrat hero . It ’ s a very , very left shift . We thought this was healed , but now we have seen that it is not healed . ”
Painting Americans like Mr. Buckles and Mr. Mulch as nationalist revolutionaries underscores the lack of a hard definition of extremism , complicated by the difficulty of a majority-white nation to address a surge of white nationalism , argues Mr. Berger , author of “ Jihad Joe , ” in an email .
In many ways , he says , the Supreme Court ’ s definition of pornography – “ I know it when I see it ” – has become the mainstream standard for extremism . “ And it ’ s not a healthy one. ” In his view , the extremism label should only be applied to groups that base their existence on the promotion of hostile action against another group .
“ If ‘ extremist ’ is just a label for someone you disagree with , then it ’ s a pretty useless label , ” says Mr. Berger .

Would these protests — which many health leaders said they support — also turn out to be virus super-spreading events ?
But a new study by a nationwide research team that includes a University of Colorado Denver professor has found something surprising : The protests may have slowed the overall spread of the coronavirus in cities with large demonstrations , including Denver .
“ We think that what ’ s going on is it ’ s the people who are not going to protest are staying away , ” said Andrew Friedson , the CU-Denver professor who is one of the paper ’ s co-authors . “ The overall effect for the entire city is more social distancing because people are avoiding the protests . ”
Friedson ’ s specialty is economics — specifically the economics of health care . The field of COVID-19 research now contains a multitude of subspecialties , and it has often been economists leading the way in understanding how people are changing their behaviors in response to the pandemic .

As the protests built , Friedson said he and his colleagues took note of the rising concerns about virus ’ spread . He said they also realized they had the ability to answer that question — using official coronavirus case counts and the anonymous , aggregated cell phone data that has become the gold standard for tracking societal shifts in movement .
The team worked quickly and published their findings earlier this month as a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper — meaning it has not yet been peer-reviewed .
“ I ’ m someone who likes to get the answers out , ” Friedson said . “ There are a lot of people who say , ‘ Well I think it should happen or I think this should happen , ’ and it ’ s nice to have some numbers to inform these decision-making processes . ”
The paper comes as officials in Colorado and other states are concerned about rising infections , especially among young people .
New infections among young people have contributed significantly to Colorado ’ s uptick in cases in recent days — a rise that reversed a weeks-long trend of falling case numbers and has put Colorado back onto the list of potential coronavirus problem spots . Meanwhile , the number of new infections among older Coloradans has dropped .

With the July 4 holiday approaching , Gov . Jared Polis and county health officials have pleaded with people to be responsible and avoid large gatherings .
“ We don ’ t have the direct causation of this uptick , ” Polis told reporters last week , noting that there is evidence that some young people who are part of an outbreak in Boulder had attended protests while other outbreaks are tied to social gatherings . “ And we hope this is a trend that is reversed in our state . ”
On Monday , a spokesman for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said that , while the state has now seen rising numbers of new cases for two consecutive weeks , “ we have not seen any clear association between the protests and an increase in cases . ”
The spokesman , Ian Dickson , said the uptick in infections “ may be partly due to some Coloradans changing their behavior — especially socializing in larger groups , sometimes without proper distancing or mask wearing . ”
Friedson said his paper doesn ’ t try to figure out whether the protests spread the virus among the people at the protest . Instead , he said the research took the bigger-picture view : What did the protests mean for overall transmission of the virus within the entire community ?
The study looked at 315 American cities with populations of more than 100,000 and found that 281 of those cities saw protests . The remaining 34 cities that did not see protests — which , at the time , included Aurora — were used as a control group against which to measure the impact of the protests .
The researchers found that protests correlated with a net increase in overall stay-at-home behavior in cities where they occurred — and the increase was larger in cities that saw more sustained protests or reports of violence .
Protesters in Denver ’ s Capitol Hill neighborhood on Saturday , June 6 , 2020 . ( Jesse Paul . ███ )
Friedson said he and his colleagues were a bit surprised at first . The protests in many cities , including Denver , were massive , drawing tens of thousands of people out to march . But they occurred in cities with hundreds of thousands to millions of residents .
“ We started thinking about it a little more and we thought , ‘ Oh my gosh we ’ re capturing everybody else , ’ ” he said .
The paper also found that , with greater social distancing , COVID case growth slowed in cities with protests from what would be expected — but not by a statistically significant amount . There may be other explanations for the trends , the study ’ s authors note . Overall , though , they say the data show that any resurgence in coronavirus cases can ’ t be pinned entirely on the protests .
“ Public speech and public health did not trade off against each other in this case , ” the authors wrote in the paper .
But Friedson said there is one last important thing to keep in mind about this study : It ’ s not a green light for governments to fully reopen bars , concert venues and other places where people gather in large numbers . The key to the researcher ’ s conclusions is that the protests , while receiving lots of support , were ultimately things most people decided to avoid . That ’ s not true of many other large gatherings .
‘ An outdoor wedding doesn ’ t generate avoidance behavior ; we ’ re measuring avoidance behavior , ” Friedson said . “ People don ’ t say , ‘ Oh man , there ’ s an outdoor wedding next door , we should stay home . ’ ”

Would these protests — which many health leaders said they support — also turn out to be virus super-spreading events?

But a new study by a nationwide research team that includes a University of Colorado Denver professor has found something surprising: The protests may have slowed the overall spread of the coronavirus in cities with large demonstrations, including Denver.

“We think that what’s going on is it’s the people who are not going to protest are staying away,” said Andrew Friedson, the CU-Denver professor who is one of the paper’s co-authors. “The overall effect for the entire city is more social distancing because people are avoiding the protests.”

“It’s nice to have some numbers”

Friedson’s specialty is economics — specifically the economics of health care. The field of COVID-19 research now contains a multitude of subspecialties, and it has often been economists leading the way in understanding how people are changing their behaviors in response to the pandemic.

As the protests built, Friedson said he and his colleagues took note of the rising concerns about virus’ spread. He said they also realized they had the ability to answer that question — using official coronavirus case counts and the anonymous, aggregated cell phone data that has become the gold standard for tracking societal shifts in movement.

The team worked quickly and published their findings earlier this month as a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper — meaning it has not yet been peer-reviewed.

“I’m someone who likes to get the answers out,” Friedson said. “There are a lot of people who say, ‘Well I think it should happen or I think this should happen,’ and it’s nice to have some numbers to inform these decision-making processes.”

Rising cases, rising worries

The paper comes as officials in Colorado and other states are concerned about rising infections, especially among young people.

New infections among young people have contributed significantly to Colorado’s uptick in cases in recent days — a rise that reversed a weeks-long trend of falling case numbers and has put Colorado back onto the list of potential coronavirus problem spots. Meanwhile, the number of new infections among older Coloradans has dropped.

With the July 4 holiday approaching, Gov. Jared Polis and county health officials have pleaded with people to be responsible and avoid large gatherings.

“We don’t have the direct causation of this uptick,” Polis told reporters last week, noting that there is evidence that some young people who are part of an outbreak in Boulder had attended protests while other outbreaks are tied to social gatherings. “And we hope this is a trend that is reversed in our state.”

On Monday, a spokesman for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said that, while the state has now seen rising numbers of new cases for two consecutive weeks, “we have not seen any clear association between the protests and an increase in cases.”

The spokesman, Ian Dickson, said the uptick in infections “may be partly due to some Coloradans changing their behavior — especially socializing in larger groups, sometimes without proper distancing or mask wearing.”

Friedson said his paper doesn’t try to figure out whether the protests spread the virus among the people at the protest. Instead, he said the research took the bigger-picture view: What did the protests mean for overall transmission of the virus within the entire community?

The study looked at 315 American cities with populations of more than 100,000 and found that 281 of those cities saw protests. The remaining 34 cities that did not see protests — which, at the time, included Aurora — were used as a control group against which to measure the impact of the protests.

The researchers found that protests correlated with a net increase in overall stay-at-home behavior in cities where they occurred — and the increase was larger in cities that saw more sustained protests or reports of violence.

Not a green light

Friedson said he and his colleagues were a bit surprised at first. The protests in many cities, including Denver, were massive, drawing tens of thousands of people out to march. But they occurred in cities with hundreds of thousands to millions of residents.

“We started thinking about it a little more and we thought, ‘Oh my gosh we’re capturing everybody else,’” he said.

The paper also found that, with greater social distancing, COVID case growth slowed in cities with protests from what would be expected — but not by a statistically significant amount. There may be other explanations for the trends, the study’s authors note. Overall, though, they say the data show that any resurgence in coronavirus cases can’t be pinned entirely on the protests.

“Public speech and public health did not trade off against each other in this case,” the authors wrote in the paper.

But Friedson said there is one last important thing to keep in mind about this study: It’s not a green light for governments to fully reopen bars, concert venues and other places where people gather in large numbers. The key to the researcher’s conclusions is that the protests, while receiving lots of support, were ultimately things most people decided to avoid. That’s not true of many other large gatherings.

‘An outdoor wedding doesn’t generate avoidance behavior; we’re measuring avoidance behavior,” Friedson said. “People don’t say, ‘Oh man, there’s an outdoor wedding next door, we should stay home.’”

After the deadly shooting in Tucson that wounded Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in 2011, many people erroneously and instantaneously blamed Sarah Palin, Michele Bachmann and others on the right for their violent or ""eliminationist"" rhetoric.

In the wake of that tragedy, President Obama called for civility. ""At a time when we are far too eager to lay the blame for all that ails the world at the feet of those who think differently than we do,"" Obama said a few days after the shooting, ""it's important for us to pause for a moment and make sure that we are talking with each other in a way that heals, not a way that wounds.""

But now the Pew Research Center has come along to try to make sense of just what Americans are thinking , with a new edition of its study of Americans ' political typology — its first since 2014 .
Pew 's analysis stands out from standard polls because it does n't simply sort Americans by demographic factors like age , race , and gender , and instead finds divisions within political parties that don ’ t fall along typical lines . To them , it ’ s not all about Hillary voters versus Bernie voters , or Trump populists versus establishment Republicans — what people actually believe creates divisions that are more complicated than that .
Instead , in surveys this summer of about 5,000 people , Pew asked respondents several ideological questions , and then used statistical techniques to try to figure out the clearest way to divide respondents ’ views into a series of coherent groups . The questions present respondents with a stark choice between two very different options :
The actual survey respondents could also volunteer that they ’ re unsure or don ’ t know . Still , it 's true that this format does n't allow for much moderation or nuance . But in a system with two major parties ( and a media environment that often lacks nuance ) , your choice about which statement you most agree with — or which one you ’ re most repelled by — can be very revealing . Here ’ s what Pew found .
1 ) Pew splits the politically engaged public into eight groups
In analyzing how the responses differed , Pew ended up dividing politically engaged voters into eight groups . Among Republicans , the “ Core Conservatives ” — traditional GOP voters — is the largest and most engaged group . “ Country First Conservatives , ” who we might think of as anti-immigration Trump fans , are relatively small in comparison . Then , two GOP-leaning groups that tend to get less attention in punditry are “ Market Skeptic Republicans , ” who stand out for their concern about the economic system favoring the powerful , and “ New Era Enterprisers ” ( they ’ re pretty moderate on social issues but economically conservative ) .
For Democrats , meanwhile , the party ’ s base is represented by “ Solid Liberals. ” But Pew also concludes there are blocs of “ Opportunity Democrats ” ( who are less concerned with discrimination and tend to have a more optimistic view of how hard work can lead to success ) , “ Disaffected Democrats ” ( who think the American dream is out of reach and are generally cynical about the system ) , and “ Devout and Diverse ” ( kind of a grab bag of mostly Democrat-leaning voters who are more conservative on one issue or another ) . Finally , there are “ Bystanders ” who aren ’ t engaged in the political process at all .
2 ) The most ideologically polarized subgroups are the most politically engaged subgroups
Want to know why US politics is so polarized ? Look at the above charts . They show three different measures of political engagement — whether people say they follow political news , whether they say they vote , and whether they think it matters who controls Congress .
On all three , the groups that are most likely to care are the solid liberals and the core conservatives — the groups that are most ideological and furthest apart from each other on their actual views . So when it comes to both winning primaries and mobilizing the base to turn out in the general election , that ’ s who the parties cater to most .
3 ) On the importance of racial discrimination , there ’ s incredible partisan polarization — but also a split among Democrats
The sheer amount of polarization in how Democratic- and Republican-leaning subgroups respond to questions about race is stark — and that polarization is greatest among “ solid liberals ” and “ core conservatives , ” the most politically engaged groups .
Eighty-four percent of solid liberals think racism is a big problem , while only 26 percent of core conservatives do . Ninety-one percent of solid liberals say they think discrimination is “ the main reason blacks can ’ t get ahead ”
Note on the bottom of the chart , though , that Democrats aren ’ t completely united on race either . That question was framed as a binary choice between “ racial discrimination is the main reason why many black people can ’ t get ahead these days , ” and “ blacks who can ’ t get ahead in this country are mostly responsible for their own condition . ”
Solid liberals overwhelmingly agreed with the former statement , while responses from the other three Democratic-leaning subgroups were much more mixed . ( And solid liberals also happen to be the most heavily white Democratic-leaning subgroup , so this discrepancy isn ’ t necessarily about white Democrats downplaying the importance of race . )
4 ) Most solid liberals say they have trouble even being friends with Trump voters
Solid liberals really , really do not like Donald Trump — so much so that 55 percent of them say that if a friend of theirs voted for Trump , it would strain their friendship . It ’ s a dramatic result that stands out a great deal . ( There ’ s no real counterpart for it among how Republican-leaning voters say they ’ d react to a Hillary Clinton-supporting friend . )
5 ) Most Americans — including a good chunk of Republicans — want corporate taxes raised , not lowered
The Republican Party has convinced itself that passing an enormous corporate tax cut is their best hope for success in the 2018 midterms . But far more actual voters seem to want corporate taxes to go up , not down — and a significant chunk of those voters are Republican .
Overall , support for lowering corporate taxes comes overwhelmingly from core conservatives . Two of the other right-leaning groups are split on the matter , and respondents categorized in another GOP-leaning group — “ Market Skeptical Republicans ” — are far more likely to say they want corporate taxes raised . So perhaps the Republican tax bill will be more divisive among the GOP coalition than many expect .
6 ) It ’ s only a vocal minority of Americans who are anti-immigrant
Another question in the survey asked respondents whether immigrants “ are a burden on our country because they take our jobs , housing , and health care , ” or whether they “ strengthen our country because of their hard work and talents. ” And 65 percent of overall respondents said they agreed with the latter statement , while only 26 percent agreed with the former one .
Yet the view of immigrants as a burden is completely overwhelming among one Republican-leaning subgroup — “ Country First Conservatives. ” Those “ Market Skeptical Republicans ” who don ’ t want a corporate tax cut also tend to view immigrants as a problem .

Anthony Watts , who runs the Watts Up With That blog , listed some of the threats to criminalize skeptics under the headline , “ Hate on Display — climate activists go bonkers over # Irma and nonexistent climate connection . ”
Climate Depot ’ s Marc Morano said the heightened vitriol aimed at those who dispute the link between climate change and extreme weather events is a sign that the global warming narrative is losing steam with the public and policymakers .
“ Activists have been frustrated with record number of polar bears , no acceleration of sea level , the Pause , no trends or declining trends in extreme weather and the public ’ s apathy , ” said Mr. Morano , whose book “ The Politically Incorrect Guide to Climate Change ” is slated to be released in February .
“ Trump has added to all of that , and we are now seeing them blow their gaskets in frustration , ” he said .
Given the heated exchanges fueled by the two hurricanes , the climate change debate is clearly far from resolved .
President Trump has said he plans to pull out of the 2015 Paris climate agreement , drawing an outcry from those who argue that rising greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are driving higher temperatures and natural disasters such as drought , wildfires and hurricanes .
“ The effects of climate change are no longer subtle . We are seeing them play out before us here and now . And they will only worsen if we fail to act , ” said a Sept. 7 op-ed in The Washington Post co-authored by Penn State climatologist Michael E. Mann .
White House homeland security adviser Tom Bossert deflected questions at a Monday press briefing about whether Harvey and Irma were caused or made worse by human-driven climate change , saying that “ causality is outside of my ability to analyze right now . ”
“ I will tell you that we continue to take seriously the climate change , not the cause of it , but the things that we observe , ” Mr. Bossert said . “ And so there ’ s rising floodwaters — I think 1 inch every 10 years in Tampa — things that would require prudent mitigation measures . ”
Meanwhile , Pope Francis said the two Category 4 storms offer proof of catastrophic climate change , even though they are the first two major hurricanes to make landfall on the U.S. mainland in 12 years .
“ You can see the effects of climate change with your own eyes , and scientists tell us clearly the way forward , ” said the pontiff , adding that leaders have a “ moral responsibility ” to take action .
An analysis by Colorado State University meteorologist Philip Klotzbach found that the latest hurricanes weren ’ t unprecedented in terms of their power upon making landfall in the U.S .
His chart showed that Irma made landfall in Florida at 929 mb , or millibars , tying it for the seventh most powerful storm to hit the mainland since record-keeping began in the 1850s .
In Texas , Hurricane Harvey ranked 17th at 938 mb , placing it in a three-way tie with an 1898 Georgia hurricane and Hurricane Hazel in 1954 .
The push to prosecute climate skeptics comes even though the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has concluded that it is “ premature to conclude that human activities — and particularly greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming — have already had a detectable impact on Atlantic hurricane or tropical cyclone activity . ”
“ That said , human activities may have already caused changes that are not yet detectable , ” said the Aug. 30 statement .
On the other side is billionaire Richard Branson , owner of Virgin Airlines , who rode out Irma on his private island in the British Virgin Islands and cited the hurricanes as evidence of human-caused global warming .
“ Man-made climate change is contributing to increasingly strong hurricanes causing unprecedented damage , ” Mr. Branson said in a Friday statement . “ The whole world should be scrambling to get on top of the climate change issue before it is too late for this generation , let alone the generations to come . ”
Mr. Watts said the air pressure graphic should prompt global warming activists to take a deep breath .
“ With Irma ranked 7th , and Harvey ranked 18th , it ’ s going to be tough for climate alarmists to try connecting these two storms to being driven by CO2/global warming , ” Mr. Watts said in a post . “ But they ’ ll do it anyway . ”","Calls to punish global warming skepticism as a criminal offense have surged in the aftermath of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, but it hasn’t discouraged climate scientists like Judith Curry.

Anthony Watts, who runs the Watts Up With That blog, listed some of the threats to criminalize skeptics under the headline, “Hate on Display — climate activists go bonkers over #Irma and nonexistent climate connection.”

Climate Depot’s Marc Morano said the heightened vitriol aimed at those who dispute the link between climate change and extreme weather events is a sign that the global warming narrative is losing steam with the public and policymakers.

“Activists have been frustrated with record number of polar bears, no acceleration of sea level, the Pause, no trends or declining trends in extreme weather and the public’s apathy,” said Mr. Morano, whose book “The Politically Incorrect Guide to Climate Change” is slated to be released in February.

“Trump has added to all of that, and we are now seeing them blow their gaskets in frustration,” he said.

Given the heated exchanges fueled by the two hurricanes, the climate change debate is clearly far from resolved.

President Trump has said he plans to pull out of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, drawing an outcry from those who argue that rising greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are driving higher temperatures and natural disasters such as drought, wildfires and hurricanes.

“The effects of climate change are no longer subtle. We are seeing them play out before us here and now. And they will only worsen if we fail to act,” said a Sept. 7 op-ed in The Washington Post co-authored by Penn State climatologist Michael E. Mann.

White House homeland security adviser Tom Bossert deflected questions at a Monday press briefing about whether Harvey and Irma were caused or made worse by human-driven climate change, saying that “causality is outside of my ability to analyze right now.”

“I will tell you that we continue to take seriously the climate change, not the cause of it, but the things that we observe,” Mr. Bossert said. “And so there’s rising floodwaters — I think 1 inch every 10 years in Tampa — things that would require prudent mitigation measures.”

Meanwhile, Pope Francis said the two Category 4 storms offer proof of catastrophic climate change, even though they are the first two major hurricanes to make landfall on the U.S. mainland in 12 years.

“You can see the effects of climate change with your own eyes, and scientists tell us clearly the way forward,” said the pontiff, adding that leaders have a “moral responsibility” to take action.

An analysis by Colorado State University meteorologist Philip Klotzbach found that the latest hurricanes weren’t unprecedented in terms of their power upon making landfall in the U.S.

His chart showed that Irma made landfall in Florida at 929 mb, or millibars, tying it for the seventh most powerful storm to hit the mainland since record-keeping began in the 1850s.

In Texas, Hurricane Harvey ranked 17th at 938 mb, placing it in a three-way tie with an 1898 Georgia hurricane and Hurricane Hazel in 1954.

The push to prosecute climate skeptics comes even though the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has concluded that it is “premature to conclude that human activities — and particularly greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming — have already had a detectable impact on Atlantic hurricane or tropical cyclone activity.”

“That said, human activities may have already caused changes that are not yet detectable,” said the Aug. 30 statement.

On the other side is billionaire Richard Branson, owner of Virgin Airlines, who rode out Irma on his private island in the British Virgin Islands and cited the hurricanes as evidence of human-caused global warming.

“Man-made climate change is contributing to increasingly strong hurricanes causing unprecedented damage,” Mr. Branson said in a Friday statement. “The whole world should be scrambling to get on top of the climate change issue before it is too late for this generation, let alone the generations to come.”

Mr. Watts said the air pressure graphic should prompt global warming activists to take a deep breath.

“With Irma ranked 7th, and Harvey ranked 18th, it’s going to be tough for climate alarmists to try connecting these two storms to being driven by CO2/global warming,” Mr. Watts said in a post. “But they’ll do it anyway.”

Miller, Robert Verbruggen, Jerry Hendrix, Charles Krauthammer, Christopher Caldwell","We have now had more than two clear years since the votes for Brexit and Trump . And although most Brexit voters dislike the tendency to link the events , the two are unavoidably intertwined .
A neutral way to interpret both surprise results was to describe them as “ disruptions. ” But very swiftly a range of carefully pejorative terms ( “ populist , ” “ reactive , ” etc . ) came to be deployed to suggest that these disruptions were not morally neutral . Soon a counter-narrative was adopted that went much further .
It was the identical nature of the pushback in both countries that was immediately striking . Shortly after the Brexit vote , the British public was inundated with media claims of “ spikes ” in racist incidents , “ hate crimes , ” and more . Whatever way people had voted , this was genuinely alarming . Had such beasts lain dormant that they had now been unleashed simply because more people ticked the box marked “ Leave ” than did “ Remain ” ? Two months after the Brexit vote , a 40-year-old Polish man was murdered in Essex . The press and pro–European Union politicians pounced on it . The Guardian claimed that the killing “ exposes the reality of post-referendum racism. ” Even the conservative Telegraph asserted that the killing raised fears that “ migrants are being targeted in post-Brexit hate-crimes. ” The head of the EU Commission blamed the murder on “ galloping populism . ”
By the time that the man ’ s 16-year-old killer was convicted of his murder one year later , the story had fallen out of the news . Before the trial it had become clear that the killing was the result of nothing more than a pointless , late-night street row , awful , terrible , and with lessons of its own to impart . But the victim ’ s race had nothing to do with it . Neither did the British public ’ s decision to vote Leave .
Still , the narrative continued . The enthusiasm for the “ outbreak of racism ” line was such that whatever facts or counter-arguments emerged to the contrary , the “ spike ” in hate crimes was clung to as an article of faith . It vindicated the worst suspicions of Remainers and cowed many Leavers . That the police had been urging people to report “ hate crimes ” during this period ( the police generally find it more restful to investigate online offense-taking than , say , deal with the upsurge in knife crime ) was ignored . The narrative of “ racist vote leads to upsurge in racism ” was too useful to be dispensed with .
Precisely the same claim was pumped into the American system after the election of Donald Trump . A collection of offhand , occasionally off-color quotations were characterized as flagrant “ dog whistles. ” One joke about Mexicans — unwise though it was for a candidate — was declared to be a racist assault on all Mexicans . And once that link was made , it was the smallest of steps to pronounce the vote for Trump “ racist ” and some sort of green light for real racists . Politicians and pundits tied a spate of bomb threats made against Jewish community centers in the U.S. and abroad in January 2017 to the inauguration of President Trump . A congressman blamed Trump supporters for the threats , and commentators issued dark warnings that these forces would come for everyone next . Two months later arrests were made of two men — one a journalist formerly with the far-left website The Intercept , the other an Israeli-American man with mental-health problems . Few people were detained by such details . The stories fit a far bigger pattern . Unlike the leaders of Brexit , the president does sometimes use language that is loose and objectionable , but nothing to allow the “ Trump encourages anti-Semitism ” narrative to thrive as it has done .
Nor has the rise in alleged hate crimes been limited to ethnic minorities . In both post-referendum Britain and post-election America , other groups were alleged to have got caught up in all this primordial outbreak of “ hate. ” The Guardian ( again ) claimed that “ homophobic attacks in UK rose 147 % in three months after Brexit vote. ” Why ? It made no sense whatsoever . Why would the British people vote to leave the European Union and celebrate by attacking gays ? Unless the European Union could be said to be the only restraining force on an otherwise unalloyedly bigoted populace ( a theme that was convenient for certain campaigners to claim ) . In fact the data on which the Guardian and others based their reports did not concern criminal convictions or even hate-crime reports but came from a single online survey carried out by an LGBT charity and voluntarily replied to by a few hundred people who may or may not have been gay .
Precisely the same smear was rolled out in the U.S. Because Donald Trump represented everything that was bigoted , obviously his election would lead to an outpouring of every type of bigotry . When Washington Post journalist Jonathan Capehart broke down in tears in a television interview just after the election , he declared that as a black man but also as a gay man he was “ frightened ” by the future that the Trump election would bring . That LGBT people were “ scared ” by the Trump victory was the perfect narrative . In the months and years that followed , various groups and media outlets continued to push onto Americans the story that they had already pushed onto the British . Anti-LGBT hate crime was now everywhere and always “ on the rise. ” And we all knew who was to blame . The sewers had opened , and these were just some of the visible results .
Of course none of this is to say that racist or homophobic acts do not occur . But a causal connection between those real events that do occur and two political events of 2016 has simply not been proven . It is a claim that it is targeted solely and purposefully to further one political contention : that the 2016 results legitimized hate and that therefore countering those results is the only thing for any decent person to do .
But the “ rise in hate ” narrative has not been the only one to span the Atlantic since 2016 . Another — it only grows with time — is that the results of the Brexit and Trump elections were illegitimate because they were “ stolen ” or “ influenced ” from abroad . This idea , which has had multiple manifestations , motivates a deep and ongoing effort to claim that the two results are in this way not merely illegitimate but linked .
In the U.K. , those who opposed the Brexit vote early on tried to pick up trails that would enable them to allege that the vote was suspect . But those efforts didn ’ t properly get under way until the Trump election , at which point people on both sides of the Atlantic who had an interest in casting doubts on the election results worked tirelessly to make a connection between an electoral surprise and a hostile foreign power . Of course elections have been disputed before . Swinging chads divided America almost 20 years ago . And yet the latest claims of electoral illegitimacy don ’ t come from one recount in Florida . They appear to able to come from almost anywhere , although those opposed to the 2016 votes have consistently focused their attentions on Russia .
In the U.S. , the most high-profile effort to prove the case has obviously been the Mueller investigation — an investigation that , in the manner of U.S. special-prosecutor investigations , is duty-bound to find something to justify its creation . In the U.K. , multiple journalists and parliamentary committees have investigated similar claims . But few have got anything remotely like evidence . Researchers at Oxford University last year looked into the claims of Russian interference in the Brexit vote . They found a grand total of 105 Russian-linked Twitter accounts that had been tweeting ahead of the vote . Twitter itself said that only one Russian-linked account had spent any money ahead of the vote ( buying just six advertisements ) , and a number of the Russian-linked accounts turned out to be tweeting in favor of Remain . To believe that the Brexit vote was swayed by a small number of Russian bots rather than decades of British disillusionment with the EU ’ s mission creep is a delusion of the highest order .
And yet it goes on . After the Twitter-bots claims fizzled , we had the saga of Cambridge Analytica , this even though the official Leave campaign at no stage hired the firm to do any work for it . For the past 18 months the claim that one data company ( again , in the words of the Guardian ) “ hijacked ” British democracy and then hacked the American election has been pumped remorselessly into our bodies politic .
Yet the Cambridge Analytica story was never about one firm . It was about an attempt to draw the dots that could be connected to prove that Russia had swayed the vote . And if it could be proved that Russia directed , hacked , or otherwise stole either of the 2016 votes , then obviously they not only would be illegitimate but ought rightly to be rerun .
A suggestion that the facts may not be on the side of the people making these claims can be partially demonstrated by the retreat of the claims themselves . Both in America and in Britain , the claims started with allegations of vote-rigging , including actual hacking of the vote . Then they moved on to social-media influencing . Now the search is for evidence that anyone connected with either the Trump or the Brexit campaign was in some way influenced or compromised by Russian money .
In the U.S. this search obviously now rotates around what connections Donald Trump Jr. did or did not have with a Russian in the course of the campaign . In the U.K. it has reduced to whether the principal funder of Leave EU , the unofficial Leave campaign , had Russian business connections . The idea that a financier of a group that did not even win the distinction of becoming the officially designated Leave campaign would nevertheless have the power to swing the referendum is now the basis of weekly strings of conjecture , suggestion , and hyperbole by Remainers in the U.K. And even though the story continues to retreat ever further from the political center of the Leave campaign , still the drip-drip of nearly unfollowable claims suggests to some that these past two years could yet be undone .
For my own part , despite having seen some of this up close , I have not written on these matters for more than two years . I do so now only because it seems to me that there are several lessons to take from these events .
The first is that it is now clear that the Brexit vote and the Trump election are hugely important milestones in both democracies , not because of what has or has not been achieved but because both constitute the first democratic mandate in either country that an elite in each country has refused to accept . I say “ an elite ” rather than “ the elite ” because my experience is that there is never one single entity of people who can control affairs . Nonetheless , in America and Britain , exceptionally powerful figures in influential positions ( in politics , the media , and much more ) decided that they could not accept the verdict of the people and chose to utilize precisely the same playbook ( “ racism , ” “ hate crime , ” “ Russia , ” “ Cambridge Analytica ” ) to undo or at least undermine the judgment of the people .
The second observation is what an unbelievably unwise and wasted opportunity this already looks to have been . If you were an anti-Trump strategist or a pro-EU campaigner , you might have taken all sorts of things from the results of 2016 . In the U.K. you could have tried to work out why the EU had been so unappealing to the British public for so many years that , even with the opt-outs and carve-outs that we had up until the vote ( and despite the uncertainty that a win for Leave was always going to cause ) , most of the public wanted out of the whole damn thing . Why had the “ experts ” become so little trusted by the public ? What could be done to rebuild that trust ? What might the EU do to show that it was not an un-listening monolith but an adaptive and helpful partner ? How might you in the decades to come persuade , rather than trick , the people into once again being inside the EU ?
An interested party in the States might try to work out why , even though every allegation and claim in the book is thrown at Donald Trump , and despite his possession of character defects that are visible at a glance , the public still voted for him . Why had the GOP and Democrats lost their hold ? What justifiable concerns and unaddressed problems did Middle America suffer ? Were there any lessons to be learned from the last time a Republican had been in the White House ? Or could we continue to pretend ( as in Britain ) that the grown-ups had done such a terrific job that the voters had no reason not to just hand over the keys once again to a leading member of one of the ruling families ?
Even now almost none of this reflection seems to have occurred , on either side of the Atlantic . And if there is one reason , it is that , even after all this time , instead of accepting the votes and trying to learn from them , elites have expended almost all their available energies trying to pretend that the voters in 2016 were bad or duped . The past two years could have been spent trying to learn something or build something . Instead , the best minds of Left and Right have spent their time making claims of “ racism , ” “ Russia , ” and “ Cambridge Analytica . ”
The final observation I would make is that all of this has gone to create a phenomenon that I have come to think of as snowplow politics . As after any other vote or election , after the Brexit and Trump votes a process should have started in which the road ahead became populated . Obviously , by their nature , elections and referendums divide . But after the verdict is in , public-minded men and women put themselves forward to help the country in whatever way they can . People in the commentariat make criticisms where they are founded and ( less commonly ) extol successes . Around their dinner tables and social gatherings , members of the public argue the merits or pitfalls of different people and policies .
Only in the past two years has this act of commingling become all but impossible . Because any time that anybody attempts to inhabit what would be the middle of the road , this great snowplow is driven straight at them . For the time being , the snowplow continues to operate on the gasoline provided by allegations such as those listed above . If you praise a particular policy of Donald Trump ’ s , you are not praising that policy but legitimizing racism , or misogyny , or Russian influence , or a hundred other things . If you are among the many people who voted Remain but decided to spend the period since 2016 accepting the vote and seeing the advantages that could come from it , you were not being pragmatic . You were encouraging hate crime , homophobia , and the hacking of your elections by foreign powers . Instead of just inhabiting what should be the normal terrain of political acceptance , you have become an accessory to a crime .
Offer the merest hint of an ameliorative or conciliatory position in public or private and the snowplow will be driven at you with the intention of flinging you back onto whatever side of the road you started out on . American pundits and politicians can not even celebrate the current success of the economy or job market without the snowplow coming at them . Britain ’ s best pro-EU minds , including statesmen and negotiators with decades of experience , did not rally around and spend the past two years helping their country . Instead they waited for the occasional TV opportunity and then used spittle-inflected fury to denounce anyone who had accepted a reality they could not — hoping thereby to empty the middle of the road of any and all pedestrians .
People often talk about the increasing divide in our politics . But they do not recognize the cause . The cause is that even after all this time the process of acceptance , healing , and mending has not even started . Instead our societies are stuck , and seem intent on staying stuck , in this period of denial and rage . Perhaps Mueller will find that Vladimir Putin personally organized the election of Donald Trump . Perhaps somebody somewhere in the non-official Leave campaign didn ’ t declare all his earnings once . It is impossible to know for certain , but it seems unlikely in the former case and unimpressive in the latter .
What we can now see is that these past two years have come at a terrible opportunity cost . Our countries , and our elites in particular , could have accepted the new reality and acted on it with good faith , in the interests of their country . Instead a precedent has been set that will not end in this electoral cycle or any other in the coming years : a situation in which accepting the results of a vote becomes a matter of choice and the idea that the public ’ s decision is final moves from being a convention to a quirk . Our politics has been rancid before . But rarely has a component so toxic been released from such a height as this ongoing failure , as we start 2019 , to accept that 2016 happened at all .","A wall in London (Dan Kitwood/Getty Images)

Trump, Brexit, and the divides deepening between us

We have now had more than two clear years since the votes for Brexit and Trump. And although most Brexit voters dislike the tendency to link the events, the two are unavoidably intertwined.

A neutral way to interpret both surprise results was to describe them as “disruptions.” But very swiftly a range of carefully pejorative terms (“populist,” “reactive,” etc.) came to be deployed to suggest that these disruptions were not morally neutral. Soon a counter-narrative was adopted that went much further.

Offer the merest hint of an ameliorative or conciliatory position in public or private and the snowplow will be driven at you with the intention of flinging you back onto whatever side of the road you started out on. American pundits and politicians cannot even celebrate the current success of the economy or job market without the snowplow coming at them. Britain’s best pro-EU minds, including statesmen and negotiators with decades of experience, did not rally around and spend the past two years helping their country. Instead they waited for the occasional TV opportunity and then used spittle-inflected fury to denounce anyone who had accepted a reality they could not — hoping thereby to empty the middle of the road of any and all pedestrians.

People often talk about the increasing divide in our politics. But they do not recognize the cause. The cause is that even after all this time the process of acceptance, healing, and mending has not even started. Instead our societies are stuck, and seem intent on staying stuck, in this period of denial and rage. Perhaps Mueller will find that Vladimir Putin personally organized the election of Donald Trump. Perhaps somebody somewhere in the non-official Leave campaign didn’t declare all his earnings once. It is impossible to know for certain, but it seems unlikely in the former case and unimpressive in the latter.

What we can now see is that these past two years have come at a terrible opportunity cost. Our countries, and our elites in particular, could have accepted the new reality and acted on it with good faith, in the interests of their country. Instead a precedent has been set that will not end in this electoral cycle or any other in the coming years: a situation in which accepting the results of a vote becomes a matter of choice and the idea that the public’s decision is final moves from being a convention to a quirk. Our politics has been rancid before. But rarely has a component so toxic been released from such a height as this ongoing failure, as we start 2019, to accept that 2016 happened at all.",www.nationalreview.com,right,EaTyYAdenCntfTNV

polarization,Reason,2,https://reason.com/2020/03/08/just-how-good-is-trumps-economy-anyway/,"Just How Good Is Trump's Economy, Anyway?",2020-03-08,"Veronique De Rugy, Elizabeth Nolan Brown, Eugene Volokh, Josh Blackman, Mike Riggs, Charles Oliver, Peter Suderman, Katie Herzog, J.D. Tuccille","If Donald Trump has his way in November 's presidential election , he 'll coast to victory on the strength of the economy .
The U.S. job market , President Trump tweeted in September , currently has its `` all time best unemployment numbers , especially for Blacks , Hispanics , Asians & Women . '' Those numbers , which only grew stronger in the final months of the year , followed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( TCJA ) , the 2017 law that Trump has , with typical hyperbole , described as `` the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history . ''
Even as the president faced a trial in the U.S. Senate , the stock market was up , unemployment was down , and average families were earning more than ever before . The week the Senate held its final vote in the impeachment trial , he delivered a State of the Union address that opened with an extended brag about the strength of the nation 's economy , which he called `` the best it has ever been . '' That is why Trump 's 2020 campaign message can be condensed into a single tweet : `` How do you impeach '' —or in the electoral case , beat— '' a President who has helped create perhaps the greatest economy in the history of our Country ? ''
For his Democratic rivals , the answer is to downplay the economy 's gains or to deny its strength altogether . At one Democratic primary debate last year , candidates were asked what they would say to a voter who dislikes Trump but likes his economy . Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I–Vt . ) rejected the premise , saying that for ordinary people , the economy `` ai n't great . '' Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( D–Mass . ) dismissed economic gains as a `` rise in corporate profits '' that are `` not being felt by millions of families across the country . '' Former Vice President Joe Biden insisted , `` The middle class is getting killed . The middle class is getting crushed . ''
In the run-up to the 2020 election , then , even the economy has become a partisan issue . As Amber Wichowsky , a political scientist at Marquette University who has studied how economic issues affect voters ' political views , recently told The New York Times , `` Partisans have a strong desire to interpret the economy in a way that benefits their 'team . ' ''
Yet there are real , nonpartisan answers to be found in the countless economic data points that paint a picture of America 's economic health . And those data tell us that in many respects , the state of our economy is strong in ways that can be attributed to Trump administration policies . The stock indices are at historic highs . JPMorgan Chase predicts another 8 percent increase in the value of the S & P 500 in 2020 as the economy `` reaccelerates . '' Meanwhile , Goldman Sachs Research forecasts steady U.S. gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth of 2.3 percent through this year .
At the same time , the economy has notable weaknesses—some of which are a product of Trump 's actions as well . In short , neither simple partisan narrative tells the full story .
The job situation under Trump is a clear success . The unemployment rate just hit a 50-year low , real wages are up , and job creation looks good—especially when compared with expectations . In its latest forecast before the 2016 election , the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) projected that the economy would add 1.9 million jobs in the next three years . In fact , according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics , the first 35 months of the Trump administration saw the economy add almost 6.7 million jobs , beating the forecast by more than 350 percent .
That figure should be kept in perspective . As it happens , during the same period in President George W. Bush 's second term , the economy gained 6 million jobs . In the aftermath of the Great Recession , during the first 35 months of President Barack Obama 's second term , the economy added 6.8 million jobs .
Overall , though , Trump 's numbers are very good , especially considering that the economy is in its 11th straight year of expansion . That 's no small achievement : The longer an expansion lasts , the harder it is to add jobs . And during the last 50 years , the economy has experienced a contraction , on average , every seven years . Under Trump , this run of economic expansion has lasted far longer than is typical .
These strong numbers have prompted many to declare the 2017 TCJA , which slashed tax rates for individuals and corporations while increasing the deficit by an estimated $ 1.5 trillion over a decade , an unmitigated success .
Although it was unwise to lower taxes without significantly cutting spending , the legislation itself was probably positive on net—particularly its reduction of America 's unusually high corporate tax rate . Defenders , however , made a mistake by framing the tax cut as a major relief for the middle class .
The middle class was n't and still is n't shouldering very much of the income-tax burden : Most income taxes are paid by higher-income earners . In 2013 , the share of federal income taxes paid by the highest-earning 10 percent of the population was roughly 70 percent , while the share of federal income taxes paid by the bottom 90 percent of income earners was about 30 percent , according to research from the Tax Foundation based on IRS data .
In addition , other key provisions of the law—like doubling the standard deduction and adding new tax credits for the middle class—were never likely to provide much economic boost .
A more promising approach to producing growth would have been to pair the corporate tax reduction from 35 percent to 21 percent with a provision allowing firms to immediately write off the cost of new equipment . In theory , those changes would spur investments , causing wages over time to rise . At the time , however , conservative advocates for the tax cuts argued that reductions in the individual side were necessary to get the support necessary to pass such large corporate tax relief . The corporate tax cuts were viewed as politically impossible without some reduction for the middle class .
It did n't work out that way . As American Enterprise Institute 's James Pethokoukis recently wrote , `` The Trump tax cuts are looking like failed politics . They 're not popular , polls suggest , and most people do n't think they got a tax cut . ''
One possible ███ for the disappointing public reaction : dramatic predictions made by many proponents that could n't possibly hold up . For example , Trump surrogates and other supporters said the TCJA would , among other things , produce annual economic growth from 3 percent to 6 percent , boost average household incomes by at least $ 4,000 a year , and pay for themselves by increasing revenues overall . They also often implied that the impact would be immediate . The optimism was reinforced when a number of firms announced bonuses and higher pay initiatives shortly after the passage of the tax reform .
Compared with the administration and its boosters , most economists and investors had much more modest expectations for the TCJA . They knew that it would take time for the corporate tax cut to deliver growth and wage increases and that the payoff might become visible only months or years down the road . That 's because the best case for the corporate tax cuts was never that companies would use their extra cash in the short term to raise workers ' wages , extend paid leave , or offer other employee benefits . Nor was it that they would suddenly add many more workers to their payrolls .
The real case for the corporate tax cut was more subtle : Lowering marginal tax rates on investment gives companies an incentive to earn more taxable income , thus leading them to invest in other businesses as well as in upgrading and expanding their facilities . This additional investment , in turn , raises workers ' productivity and ultimately leads to higher wages . But it 's a process that takes time .
Nearly two years later , we can start to look back and determine if any of these things have happened . The U.S. economy definitely grew—but not at the 3 percent ( or more ) annual rate predicted by the administration . In 2018 , the year after the TCJA was adopted , the economy grew by 2.9 percent . This was an improvement from 2016 and 2017 but roughly in line with 2014 and 2015 . We do n't yet have final numbers for 2019 , but GDP growth is expected to be around 2.2 percent , giving an average growth rate of 2.5 percent for Trump 's first three years in office—similar to the first three years of Obama 's second term .
How much of the growth in output can be attributed to the tax cuts ? Most estimates suggest that in 2018 , the TCJA increased GDP by 0.3 percent to 0.5 percent , while the CBO projects that the increase will be 0.6 percent for 2019 .
When it comes to investment growth , assessing the impact of the law gets more complicated . But the answer matters a great deal , since a boost in investment is one of the main channels by which the tax reform was supposed to deliver economic and wage growth .
As it turns out , investment did accelerate significantly in 2018 . Wages also grew by 3 percent—a boost that mostly benefited workers at the bottom of the income distribution . Yet that 's a far cry from the 7.8 percent wage growth that would have been needed in order for the TCJA to deliver on its promise of a $ 4,000 increase in average household income , according to The Wall Street Journal .
Moreover , the investment uptick did n't last . Data from the Federal Reserve of St. Louis Research Division show that capital investment growth has been falling since fall 2018 . Correlation is not causation , so this does n't mean that the tax cuts are the ███ investment fell . But it does raise some doubt about claims that the cuts would cause a significant increase in investment—an outcome that proponents of the corporate tax cut , including me , predicted .
Several things could be going on . First , it 's worth noting that in both pre– and post–tax cut forecasts , business investment had been projected to slow down . In other words , investment in 2018 was beating the forecast . So this could simply be a return to the predicted trend . Second , the growth in capital expenditures could be taking longer than expected to materialize . Third , the effects of the tax cuts on investments could be undercut by non-TCJA factors , such as lower oil prices or the grounding of Boeing 's 737 MAX airliners .
Another strong countervailing force , of course , could be the president 's trade war . According to the Tax Foundation , the tariffs have reduced long-run GDP by 0.26 percent . The erratic announcements of tariffs , the resulting increase in costs for many American producers , and the predictable retaliation by foreign governments all slowed global growth and negatively affected business confidence in 2019 . In turn , many companies were obliged to freeze projects or to defer investment plans . One recent study from the Federal Reserve found that any benefits U.S. manufacturers might have gained from reduced foreign competition were probably canceled out by the effects of retaliatory tariffs abroad and more expensive goods at home .
In other words , without the TCJA , the trade war—which has produced a recession in manufacturing—would almost certainly have dampened capital expenditures even further than it did .
Trump 's trade war is n't the only policy this administration has pursued with the potential to moderate or cancel out the beneficial effects of the 2017 tax cuts . Overspending is another .
In 2016 , right before Trump took office , federal spending was $ 3.9 trillion . Two years later , that number had risen to $ 4.1 trillion . During the same period , the federal deficit grew from $ 585 billion to almost $ 1 trillion—with trillion-dollar deficits expected to continue for years to come . Total expenditures for this year include at least $ 28 billion in bailout payments to farmers to make up for the pain inflicted by the trade war .
The president is not fully responsible for this spending frenzy ; Congress has failed to abide by its own budget processes for years and has made a series of bipartisan deals to raise both domestic and military spending . But Trump 's utter lack of interest in fiscal discipline—including repeatedly declaring that he wo n't touch Social Security and Medicare , the biggest long-term drivers of the federal debt—seems to have encouraged Republicans in Congress , who were happy enough to overspend anyway , to completely abandon any pretense of fiscal responsibility .
All of this fueled an expansion in the federal debt from $ 19 trillion at the beginning of 2016 to $ 22 trillion at the end of 2018 . It 's unclear how big a toll this red ink has taken on the economy , but I am quite certain it has had one . In the wake of the financial crisis , economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff published a paper called `` Growth in a Time of Debt , '' which concluded that when gross debt as a share of GDP increases beyond 90 percent , economic growth slows . The paper was widely cited among commentators , academics , and politicians in the debate surrounding austerity and fiscal policy in debt-burdened economies . Unfortunately , some data errors allowed skeptics to discredit Reinhart and Rogoff 's findings .
A recent review of the literature , however , reveals that high government debt ratios do have negative effects on economic growth rates . The question of how much growth is lost from higher debt remains a matter of debate . But there 's little doubt that over time , carrying large amounts of public debt has damaging economic effects .
What about deregulation ? In his first week in office , Trump issued Executive Order 13771 , titled `` Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs , '' which requires that `` for every new regulation issued , at least two prior regulations be identified for elimination , and that the cost of planned regulations be prudently managed and controlled through a budgeting process . ''
The White House claims that `` under the President 's leadership , the Administration has cut 8 and a half regulations for every new rule , far exceeding his promise to cut two regulations for every new one . '' The Council of Economic Advisers ( CEA ) estimates that after five to 10 years , this new approach to federal regulation will have raised real incomes by $ 3,100 per household per year .
This sort of claim is hard to check , and it seems overly optimistic . Still , Federal Register data compiled by the Center for Regulatory Studies at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University , where I work , reveals that the total number of federal regulations has indeed stalled in recent years .
That is a positive trajectory compared to the Obama administration . Yet simply counting the rules does n't fully capture their impact . The number of economically significant regulations is growing more today than it did under President Ronald Reagan . It may be that the Trump administration picked the low-hanging fruit in 2017 and 2018 and has now reached its deregulatory potential . But this raises some doubt as to how much wage growth we can really expect to result from Trump 's deregulation efforts .
If economic performance is what ultimately decides national elections , November should be a cakewalk for Trump . While the 2017 tax cuts did n't deliver the results promised by the president and his magical-thinking supporters , the administration has delivered some continued economic expansion , some job creation , and some investment growth , followed by some wage increases . Time will tell how durable those benefits are .
Does it matter , politically speaking ? In fact , there is some ███ to think that voters prioritize economics above other issues . According to a new survey from CNBC , when asked what `` matters the most to you right now , '' 24 percent of Americans cite jobs and the economy , first among all responses , ahead of health care , immigration , and the environment .
Historically , the state of the economy is one of the best predictors of presidential elections . And today , most people are feeling pretty good : Only 21 percent of Americans say they 're worse off now than they were four years ago . Although the latest RealClearPolitics polling average shows that 56 percent of Americans think the country is going in the wrong direction , that result is better than the 62 percent Americans who were pessimistic in November 2016 .
Yet according to the CNBC poll , only 34 percent of Americans say the next presidential election will be about the economy . The current levels of ideological division may seriously diminish the potency of `` the state of the economy '' as a predictive variable in 2020 , since partisan voters are likely to interpret the economic information available to them in a way that suits their political beliefs . The truth is that no one knows what the economic performance of the last four years means for the president 's re-election chances .
Trump 's legacy will probably not depend on how the economy fares during his presidency . I suspect he will be remembered more for his lack of ethics , his juvenile language , his online bullying , his callous immigration policy , his admiration for foreign despots , his personal insecurities , his payment of hush money to a porn star—and , of course , for being impeached .
But there is little question that the Trump economy is , at least as of the first days of 2020 , doing well . While presidents tend to have less control over economic outcomes than they—or the public—like to believe , at least some of the current success is due to policies implemented by this administration . Then again , Trump inherited an economy that was already in reasonably good shape . He has mostly managed not to mess it up .
For all of Trump 's many failures to grasp economic principles ( especially when it comes to the trade war ) , he exhibits no desire to be a full-scale social engineer . His worst economic instincts reflect standard-issue 17th century mercantilist fallacies . Humankind has flirted with , and often fallen head-over-heels in love with , these fallacies for centuries . They are damaging . They are maddening . And they 're inexcusable in the modern era . But they do n't represent the sort of calamitous wholesale restructuring of the economy promoted by the likes of Sens . Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren .
In short , the president is a protectionist spendthrift . But he is not a socialist or a grand economic designer of any kind . And these days , that goes a long way toward keeping entrepreneurs and investors happy to create and compete in U.S. markets .
This does n't make Trump a free marketeer or even a decent president . But it does help to explain the continued support he receives from the business community , which in turn explains—at least in part—the stock market 's current buoyancy .
We are lucky to have an incredibly rich , resilient , and robust economy . The American economic system is not a delicate flower rooted in shallow or nutrient-poor institutional soil . Instead , it is a hardy oak , deeply planted in ground that 's fed and watered by well-maintained institutions under which property and contract rights are reasonably secure and risk taking and innovation are generally rewarded . As long as our economy continues to be open and free , it is likely to keep growing .","If Donald Trump has his way in November's presidential election, he'll coast to victory on the strength of the economy.

The U.S. job market, President Trump tweeted in September, currently has its ""all time best unemployment numbers, especially for Blacks, Hispanics, Asians & Women."" Those numbers, which only grew stronger in the final months of the year, followed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), the 2017 law that Trump has, with typical hyperbole, described as ""the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history.""

Even as the president faced a trial in the U.S. Senate, the stock market was up, unemployment was down, and average families were earning more than ever before. The week the Senate held its final vote in the impeachment trial, he delivered a State of the Union address that opened with an extended brag about the strength of the nation's economy, which he called ""the best it has ever been."" That is why Trump's 2020 campaign message can be condensed into a single tweet: ""How do you impeach""—or in the electoral case, beat—""a President who has helped create perhaps the greatest economy in the history of our Country?""

For his Democratic rivals, the answer is to downplay the economy's gains or to deny its strength altogether. At one Democratic primary debate last year, candidates were asked what they would say to a voter who dislikes Trump but likes his economy. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I–Vt.) rejected the premise, saying that for ordinary people, the economy ""ain't great."" Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D–Mass.) dismissed economic gains as a ""rise in corporate profits"" that are ""not being felt by millions of families across the country."" Former Vice President Joe Biden insisted, ""The middle class is getting killed. The middle class is getting crushed.""

In the run-up to the 2020 election, then, even the economy has become a partisan issue. As Amber Wichowsky, a political scientist at Marquette University who has studied how economic issues affect voters' political views, recently told The New York Times, ""Partisans have a strong desire to interpret the economy in a way that benefits their 'team.'""

Yet there are real, nonpartisan answers to be found in the countless economic data points that paint a picture of America's economic health. And those data tell us that in many respects, the state of our economy is strong in ways that can be attributed to Trump administration policies. The stock indices are at historic highs. JPMorgan Chase predicts another 8 percent increase in the value of the S&P 500 in 2020 as the economy ""reaccelerates."" Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs Research forecasts steady U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 2.3 percent through this year.

At the same time, the economy has notable weaknesses—some of which are a product of Trump's actions as well. In short, neither simple partisan narrative tells the full story.

Jobs

The job situation under Trump is a clear success. The unemployment rate just hit a 50-year low, real wages are up, and job creation looks good—especially when compared with expectations. In its latest forecast before the 2016 election, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected that the economy would add 1.9 million jobs in the next three years. In fact, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the first 35 months of the Trump administration saw the economy add almost 6.7 million jobs, beating the forecast by more than 350 percent.

That figure should be kept in perspective. As it happens, during the same period in President George W. Bush's second term, the economy gained 6 million jobs. In the aftermath of the Great Recession, during the first 35 months of President Barack Obama's second term, the economy added 6.8 million jobs.

Overall, though, Trump's numbers are very good, especially considering that the economy is in its 11th straight year of expansion. That's no small achievement: The longer an expansion lasts, the harder it is to add jobs. And during the last 50 years, the economy has experienced a contraction, on average, every seven years. Under Trump, this run of economic expansion has lasted far longer than is typical.

Taxes and Trade

These strong numbers have prompted many to declare the 2017 TCJA, which slashed tax rates for individuals and corporations while increasing the deficit by an estimated $1.5 trillion over a decade, an unmitigated success.

Although it was unwise to lower taxes without significantly cutting spending, the legislation itself was probably positive on net—particularly its reduction of America's unusually high corporate tax rate. Defenders, however, made a mistake by framing the tax cut as a major relief for the middle class.

The middle class wasn't and still isn't shouldering very much of the income-tax burden: Most income taxes are paid by higher-income earners. In 2013, the share of federal income taxes paid by the highest-earning 10 percent of the population was roughly 70 percent, while the share of federal income taxes paid by the bottom 90 percent of income earners was about 30 percent, according to research from the Tax Foundation based on IRS data.

In addition, other key provisions of the law—like doubling the standard deduction and adding new tax credits for the middle class—were never likely to provide much economic boost.

A more promising approach to producing growth would have been to pair the corporate tax reduction from 35 percent to 21 percent with a provision allowing firms to immediately write off the cost of new equipment. In theory, those changes would spur investments, causing wages over time to rise. At the time, however, conservative advocates for the tax cuts argued that reductions in the individual side were necessary to get the support necessary to pass such large corporate tax relief. The corporate tax cuts were viewed as politically impossible without some reduction for the middle class.

It didn't work out that way. As American Enterprise Institute's James Pethokoukis recently wrote, ""The Trump tax cuts are looking like failed politics. They're not popular, polls suggest, and most people don't think they got a tax cut.""

One possible reason for the disappointing public reaction: dramatic predictions made by many proponents that couldn't possibly hold up. For example, Trump surrogates and other supporters said the TCJA would, among other things, produce annual economic growth from 3 percent to 6 percent, boost average household incomes by at least $4,000 a year, and pay for themselves by increasing revenues overall. They also often implied that the impact would be immediate. The optimism was reinforced when a number of firms announced bonuses and higher pay initiatives shortly after the passage of the tax reform.

Compared with the administration and its boosters, most economists and investors had much more modest expectations for the TCJA. They knew that it would take time for the corporate tax cut to deliver growth and wage increases and that the payoff might become visible only months or years down the road. That's because the best case for the corporate tax cuts was never that companies would use their extra cash in the short term to raise workers' wages, extend paid leave, or offer other employee benefits. Nor was it that they would suddenly add many more workers to their payrolls.

The real case for the corporate tax cut was more subtle: Lowering marginal tax rates on investment gives companies an incentive to earn more taxable income, thus leading them to invest in other businesses as well as in upgrading and expanding their facilities. This additional investment, in turn, raises workers' productivity and ultimately leads to higher wages. But it's a process that takes time.

Nearly two years later, we can start to look back and determine if any of these things have happened. The U.S. economy definitely grew—but not at the 3 percent (or more) annual rate predicted by the administration. In 2018, the year after the TCJA was adopted, the economy grew by 2.9 percent. This was an improvement from 2016 and 2017 but roughly in line with 2014 and 2015. We don't yet have final numbers for 2019, but GDP growth is expected to be around 2.2 percent, giving an average growth rate of 2.5 percent for Trump's first three years in office—similar to the first three years of Obama's second term.

How much of the growth in output can be attributed to the tax cuts? Most estimates suggest that in 2018, the TCJA increased GDP by 0.3 percent to 0.5 percent, while the CBO projects that the increase will be 0.6 percent for 2019.

When it comes to investment growth, assessing the impact of the law gets more complicated. But the answer matters a great deal, since a boost in investment is one of the main channels by which the tax reform was supposed to deliver economic and wage growth.

As it turns out, investment did accelerate significantly in 2018. Wages also grew by 3 percent—a boost that mostly benefited workers at the bottom of the income distribution. Yet that's a far cry from the 7.8 percent wage growth that would have been needed in order for the TCJA to deliver on its promise of a $4,000 increase in average household income, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Moreover, the investment uptick didn't last. Data from the Federal Reserve of St. Louis Research Division show that capital investment growth has been falling since fall 2018. Correlation is not causation, so this doesn't mean that the tax cuts are the reason investment fell. But it does raise some doubt about claims that the cuts would cause a significant increase in investment—an outcome that proponents of the corporate tax cut, including me, predicted.

Several things could be going on. First, it's worth noting that in both pre– and post–tax cut forecasts, business investment had been projected to slow down. In other words, investment in 2018 was beating the forecast. So this could simply be a return to the predicted trend. Second, the growth in capital expenditures could be taking longer than expected to materialize. Third, the effects of the tax cuts on investments could be undercut by non-TCJA factors, such as lower oil prices or the grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX airliners.

Another strong countervailing force, of course, could be the president's trade war. According to the Tax Foundation, the tariffs have reduced long-run GDP by 0.26 percent. The erratic announcements of tariffs, the resulting increase in costs for many American producers, and the predictable retaliation by foreign governments all slowed global growth and negatively affected business confidence in 2019. In turn, many companies were obliged to freeze projects or to defer investment plans. One recent study from the Federal Reserve found that any benefits U.S. manufacturers might have gained from reduced foreign competition were probably canceled out by the effects of retaliatory tariffs abroad and more expensive goods at home.

In other words, without the TCJA, the trade war—which has produced a recession in manufacturing—would almost certainly have dampened capital expenditures even further than it did.

Debt and Deficits

Trump's trade war isn't the only policy this administration has pursued with the potential to moderate or cancel out the beneficial effects of the 2017 tax cuts. Overspending is another.

In 2016, right before Trump took office, federal spending was $3.9 trillion. Two years later, that number had risen to $4.1 trillion. During the same period, the federal deficit grew from $585 billion to almost $1 trillion—with trillion-dollar deficits expected to continue for years to come. Total expenditures for this year include at least $28 billion in bailout payments to farmers to make up for the pain inflicted by the trade war.

The president is not fully responsible for this spending frenzy; Congress has failed to abide by its own budget processes for years and has made a series of bipartisan deals to raise both domestic and military spending. But Trump's utter lack of interest in fiscal discipline—including repeatedly declaring that he won't touch Social Security and Medicare, the biggest long-term drivers of the federal debt—seems to have encouraged Republicans in Congress, who were happy enough to overspend anyway, to completely abandon any pretense of fiscal responsibility.

All of this fueled an expansion in the federal debt from $19 trillion at the beginning of 2016 to $22 trillion at the end of 2018. It's unclear how big a toll this red ink has taken on the economy, but I am quite certain it has had one. In the wake of the financial crisis, economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff published a paper called ""Growth in a Time of Debt,"" which concluded that when gross debt as a share of GDP increases beyond 90 percent, economic growth slows. The paper was widely cited among commentators, academics, and politicians in the debate surrounding austerity and fiscal policy in debt-burdened economies. Unfortunately, some data errors allowed skeptics to discredit Reinhart and Rogoff's findings.

A recent review of the literature, however, reveals that high government debt ratios do have negative effects on economic growth rates. The question of how much growth is lost from higher debt remains a matter of debate. But there's little doubt that over time, carrying large amounts of public debt has damaging economic effects.

Deregulation

What about deregulation? In his first week in office, Trump issued Executive Order 13771, titled ""Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs,"" which requires that ""for every new regulation issued, at least two prior regulations be identified for elimination, and that the cost of planned regulations be prudently managed and controlled through a budgeting process.""

The White House claims that ""under the President's leadership, the Administration has cut 8 and a half regulations for every new rule, far exceeding his promise to cut two regulations for every new one."" The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) estimates that after five to 10 years, this new approach to federal regulation will have raised real incomes by $3,100 per household per year.

This sort of claim is hard to check, and it seems overly optimistic. Still, Federal Register data compiled by the Center for Regulatory Studies at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, where I work, reveals that the total number of federal regulations has indeed stalled in recent years.

That is a positive trajectory compared to the Obama administration. Yet simply counting the rules doesn't fully capture their impact. The number of economically significant regulations is growing more today than it did under President Ronald Reagan. It may be that the Trump administration picked the low-hanging fruit in 2017 and 2018 and has now reached its deregulatory potential. But this raises some doubt as to how much wage growth we can really expect to result from Trump's deregulation efforts.

Does It Matter?

If economic performance is what ultimately decides national elections, November should be a cakewalk for Trump. While the 2017 tax cuts didn't deliver the results promised by the president and his magical-thinking supporters, the administration has delivered some continued economic expansion, some job creation, and some investment growth, followed by some wage increases. Time will tell how durable those benefits are.

Does it matter, politically speaking? In fact, there is some reason to think that voters prioritize economics above other issues. According to a new survey from CNBC, when asked what ""matters the most to you right now,"" 24 percent of Americans cite jobs and the economy, first among all responses, ahead of health care, immigration, and the environment.

Historically, the state of the economy is one of the best predictors of presidential elections. And today, most people are feeling pretty good: Only 21 percent of Americans say they're worse off now than they were four years ago. Although the latest RealClearPolitics polling average shows that 56 percent of Americans think the country is going in the wrong direction, that result is better than the 62 percent Americans who were pessimistic in November 2016.

Yet according to the CNBC poll, only 34 percent of Americans say the next presidential election will be about the economy. The current levels of ideological division may seriously diminish the potency of ""the state of the economy"" as a predictive variable in 2020, since partisan voters are likely to interpret the economic information available to them in a way that suits their political beliefs. The truth is that no one knows what the economic performance of the last four years means for the president's re-election chances.

Trump's Legacy

Trump's legacy will probably not depend on how the economy fares during his presidency. I suspect he will be remembered more for his lack of ethics, his juvenile language, his online bullying, his callous immigration policy, his admiration for foreign despots, his personal insecurities, his payment of hush money to a porn star—and, of course, for being impeached.

But there is little question that the Trump economy is, at least as of the first days of 2020, doing well. While presidents tend to have less control over economic outcomes than they—or the public—like to believe, at least some of the current success is due to policies implemented by this administration. Then again, Trump inherited an economy that was already in reasonably good shape. He has mostly managed not to mess it up.

For all of Trump's many failures to grasp economic principles (especially when it comes to the trade war), he exhibits no desire to be a full-scale social engineer. His worst economic instincts reflect standard-issue 17th century mercantilist fallacies. Humankind has flirted with, and often fallen head-over-heels in love with, these fallacies for centuries. They are damaging. They are maddening. And they're inexcusable in the modern era. But they don't represent the sort of calamitous wholesale restructuring of the economy promoted by the likes of Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.

In short, the president is a protectionist spendthrift. But he is not a socialist or a grand economic designer of any kind. And these days, that goes a long way toward keeping entrepreneurs and investors happy to create and compete in U.S. markets.

This doesn't make Trump a free marketeer or even a decent president. But it does help to explain the continued support he receives from the business community, which in turn explains—at least in part—the stock market's current buoyancy.

We are lucky to have an incredibly rich, resilient, and robust economy. The American economic system is not a delicate flower rooted in shallow or nutrient-poor institutional soil.

polarization,Daily Beast,0,http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/01/14/in-defense-of-moderation.html?via=desktop&source=twitter,In Defense of Moderation,2017-01-14,Aurelian Craiutu,"Last year ’ s presidential elections and the heated electoral campaign suggested that moderation is not a winning political tactic . To be sure , moderation did not get many people elected last November . But properly understood , moderation is actually a fighting virtue and winning card .
Interest in this old and elusive virtue has increased in the recent weeks , as we prepare for the inauguration of the new President . The title of a recent show on NPR in which I participated was “ Moderation as Democracy ’ s Key in an Age of Extremes. ” In the New York Times and Washington Post , Peter Wehner and Jennifer Rubin spoke about moderation as a potentially effective strategy of opposing Trump and making Congress less dysfunctional .
I am not sure moderation is the key to solving all our problems in our age of increased polarization and ideological intransigence . But paraphrasing Albert Camus ’ s words , I do believe that our world still needs today “ burning hearts , men who know the proper place of moderation . ”
How so ? We first need to address the prevalent skepticism toward moderation on both the left and the right .
The listeners of the NPR program were not shy at expressing their skepticism . Some questioned whether moderation is a virtue at all , while a few claimed that there is no real market today for moderation in our political system dominated by money , distrust , and greed . Others argued that ours is a time for total opposition , radicalism , and mobilization instead of moderation . “ I think I 've figured out what annoys me about today 's topic , ” one listener wrote . “ People do n't organize based on ideas of moderation . On this view , “ moderation now in the US would be called more accurately appeasement , ” an endorsement for the status quo , or simply treason . “ To be moderate is to be a bystander , ” another listener remarked . “ What we are witnessing is a fatal moral crisis of our nation . We can not normalize our current political climate by feigning moderation as a realistic tactic. ” Finally , one ( Christian ) listener went all the way to claim that moderation is , in fact , the root of all our problems today . Period .
Moderation can not possibly be at the same time the key to all our problems and their root as well . It is a notoriously slippery concept , with a long tradition behind it . So let ’ s define this often misinterpreted virtue to avoid further confusion .
Moderation is a complex , difficult , and eclectic virtue which has many faces and a distinguished tradition . The latter goes as far back as Aristotle and Plato and continues in the works of Montesquieu , James Madison , Edmund Burke , and Alexis de Tocqueville , to name only a few .
Moderation is much more than the proverbial golden mean between the extremes . It refers to several things : a certain character trait , a specific style of political action , and a unique set of institutional and constitutional arrangements . Behind all that , there is a unique political vision that may sometimes be difficult to grasp because it builds upon ideas and principles from all sides of the political spectrum . Yet , it is an original vision nonetheless .
What does it consist of ? At its core lies a certain vision of the public good that seeks to promote more inclusion , toleration , fair competition , and fewer inequalities . As trimmers who seek to keep the ship of the state on an even keel , moderates display unhesitating loyalty to limited ( and complex ) government , freedom , and the rule of law . They eschew violence and favor incremental changes to improve their communities . Nonetheless , moderation should not be narrowly identified with the political center since those committed to this virtue can exist on all aisles of the political spectrum . Some moderates prefer to locate themselves in the center while others do not .
Political moderation has often been linked to the separation and balance of powers , executive veto , and bills of rights . That is why moderates promote social and political pluralism and work to promote balance between competing values , principles , ideas , and groups in society . But in so doing , they refuse to define one single best way , paying instead close attention to nuances and hybrid solutions .

Aurelian Craiutu is Professor of Political Science at Indiana University , Bloomington , and the author of Faces of Moderation : The Art of Balance in an Age of Extremes ( Penn Press , 2017 ) .","Last year’s presidential elections and the heated electoral campaign suggested that moderation is not a winning political tactic. To be sure, moderation did not get many people elected last November. But properly understood, moderation is actually a fighting virtue and winning card.

Interest in this old and elusive virtue has increased in the recent weeks, as we prepare for the inauguration of the new President. The title of a recent show on NPR in which I participated was “Moderation as Democracy’s Key in an Age of Extremes.” In the New York Times and Washington Post, Peter Wehner and Jennifer Rubin spoke about moderation as a potentially effective strategy of opposing Trump and making Congress less dysfunctional.

I am not sure moderation is the key to solving all our problems in our age of increased polarization and ideological intransigence. But paraphrasing Albert Camus’s words, I do believe that our world still needs today “burning hearts, men who know the proper place of moderation.”

How so? We first need to address the prevalent skepticism toward moderation on both the left and the right.

The listeners of the NPR program were not shy at expressing their skepticism. Some questioned whether moderation is a virtue at all, while a few claimed that there is no real market today for moderation in our political system dominated by money, distrust, and greed. Others argued that ours is a time for total opposition, radicalism, and mobilization instead of moderation. “I think I've figured out what annoys me about today's topic,” one listener wrote. “People don't organize based on ideas of moderation. On this view, “moderation now in the US would be called more accurately appeasement,” an endorsement for the status quo, or simply treason. “To be moderate is to be a bystander,” another listener remarked. “What we are witnessing is a fatal moral crisis of our nation. We cannot normalize our current political climate by feigning moderation as a realistic tactic.” Finally, one (Christian) listener went all the way to claim that moderation is, in fact, the root of all our problems today. Period.

Moderation cannot possibly be at the same time the key to all our problems and their root as well. It is a notoriously slippery concept, with a long tradition behind it. So let’s define this often misinterpreted virtue to avoid further confusion.

Moderation is a complex, difficult, and eclectic virtue which has many faces and a distinguished tradition. The latter goes as far back as Aristotle and Plato and continues in the works of Montesquieu, James Madison, Edmund Burke, and Alexis de Tocqueville, to name only a few.

Moderation is much more than the proverbial golden mean between the extremes. It refers to several things: a certain character trait, a specific style of political action, and a unique set of institutional and constitutional arrangements. Behind all that, there is a unique political vision that may sometimes be difficult to grasp because it builds upon ideas and principles from all sides of the political spectrum. Yet, it is an original vision nonetheless.

What does it consist of? At its core lies a certain vision of the public good that seeks to promote more inclusion, toleration, fair competition, and fewer inequalities. As trimmers who seek to keep the ship of the state on an even keel, moderates display unhesitating loyalty to limited (and complex) government, freedom, and the rule of law. They eschew violence and favor incremental changes to improve their communities. Nonetheless, moderation should not be narrowly identified with the political center since those committed to this virtue can exist on all aisles of the political spectrum. Some moderates prefer to locate themselves in the center while others do not.

Political moderation has often been linked to the separation and balance of powers, executive veto, and bills of rights. That is why moderates promote social and political pluralism and work to promote balance between competing values, principles, ideas, and groups in society. But in so doing, they refuse to define one single best way, paying instead close attention to nuances and hybrid solutions. They think that gray, too, can be beautiful, as one of the heroes of my book, Adam Michnik, once memorably put it.

The moderates’s style of political action is best illustrated by their thinking politically rather than ideologically. Their opinions tend to be based on careful consideration of facts rather than on abstract moral imperatives. This way of addressing political issues is the opposite of ideological thinking, a closed system of thought based in eternal principles or infallible dogmas. As another great moderate (Raymond Aron) once said, “ in political affairs it is impossible to demonstrate truth, but one can try, on the basis of what one knows, to make sensible decisions.” The latter involve tough trade-offs and significant opportunity costs, and require constant small-scale adjustments and gradual steps. That is why moderates accept that we must learn how to cope with risks and unforeseeable consequences which simultaneously require pragmatic prudence and courage.

Another distinctive feature of the moderates’ style is their opposition to Manichaeism. Their world is not bipolar, black-and-white; it is a world made of many shades of gray (although perhaps not as many as fifty!). That is why moderates make a special effort to listen to all sides of the debate and keep the conversation open with their friends, critics, and opponents. Their invitation to dialogue and their willingness to speak to their critics demonstrate their courage and determination not to look for “safe spaces” and lukewarm solutions.

Yet, moderation is not a virtue for everyone and for all seasons. A few decades ago, another moderate, Isaiah Berlin, confessed to Kay Graham, the editor of the Washington Post: “It obviously does not do to have a political position at all unless it is a god crude, simple thing, painted in bright colors.” He was right. It is difficult to act like a moderate because that implies a complex balancing act not unlike the art of walking along a thin wire or rope. It presupposes making constant judgments about how to balance different values and address the inevitable tensions of political life.

Moderation cannot then be a substitute for pragmatic partisanship for politics cannot function without strong contestation and deep disagreement. Moderation can however bring about the civility without which our system would be entirely dysfunctional. I think that John Adams was entirely right when writing that “without the great political virtues of humility, patience, and moderation … every man in power becomes a ravenous beast of prey.”

We should not forget that moderation has always been at the heart of the American political system. It may not offer a platform for effective mass mobilization, but being a moderate is not the same as being a bystander.

Ha .. made you look.

It's pretty well-known that America's political conservatives and liberals inhabit vastly different universes. Each side has pronounced beliefs, held deeply, and there's no shortage of opinion journals (and even cable news stations) that reaffirm their respective world views.

But who's the more tolerant? Those on the political left (which prides itself on tolerance) or those on the right?

A new study by The Pew Research Center finds that ...

...

...

Liberals are less tolerant than conservatives -- based on how likely they are to unfriend or stop following on social media when their preconceptions are challenged, researchers found.

""Roughly four-in-ten consistent liberals on Facebook (44%) say they have blocked or defriended someone on social media because they disagreed with something that person posted about politics,"" Pew researchers found.

That compares to ""31 percent of consistent conservatives and just 26 percent of all Facebook users who have done the same,"" the Pew study concluded.

Some other findings from the study, which tried to gauge political polarization in the country.

Overall, consistent conservatives are:

Are tightly clustered around a single news source, far more than any other group in the survey, with

Express greater distrust than trust of 24 of the 36 news sources measured in the survey. At the same time, fully 88% of consistent conservatives trust Fox News.

Are, when on Facebook, more likely than those in other ideological groups to hear political opinions that are in line with their own views.

Are more likely to have friends who share their own political views. Two-thirds (66%) say most of their close friends share their views on government and politics.

And consistent liberals are:

Are less unified in their media loyalty; they rely on a greater range of news outlets, including some - like NPR and the New York Times- that others use far less.

Express more trust than distrust of 28 of the 36 news outlets in the survey.

Are more likely than those in other ideological groups to block or ""defriend"" someone on a social network - as well as to end a personal friendship - because of politics.

Are more likely to follow issue-based groups, rather than political parties or candidates, in their Facebook feeds.

“ Compare 2013 and [ 2018 ] and how the two presidents have acted , ” Mr. Mulvaney said on “ Fox News Sunday. ” “ I went through the middle of 2013 — I think I was on your show during that shutdown — and I will look you in the eye and tell you that President Obama wanted that shutdown . ”
Why ? “ He wanted to weaponize it . He wanted to use it politically to hurt Republicans because he thought Republicans would get blamed politically , and he wanted that shutdown , ” the budget director said .
On the other hand , said Mr. Mulvaney , “ this president has worked really , really hard to prevent the shutdown , ” citing his meetings with congressional Democrats and Republicans .

Mr. Mulvaney served in the House during the 2013 shutdown , which saw part of the federal government close from Oct. 1 to Oct. 17 after Republicans balked at funding Obamacare .
This time , Senate Republicans were unable to round up enough votes to stave off a Democratic filibuster after Democrats pushed for a deal first on issues such as a permanent fix for the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) program .
“ I don ’ t think anybody can say that this president wants this shutdown . You could not say the same thing about President Obama . In fact , I think he actually did want it , ” said Mr. Mulvaney , who heads the Office of Management and Budget .
Indeed , Republicans did take the lion ’ s share of the blame for the 2013 partial shutdown , but which party will be held responsible for this year ’ s stalemate is unclear .
A Washington Post-ABC News poll released Friday , before funding expired at 12:01 a.m. Saturday , showed that 48 percent of those surveyed found Republicans responsible versus 28 percent who blamed Democrats and 18 percent who said both .
Then again , a CNN poll released the same day showed that 56 percent said it was more important to avoid a government shutdown than to extend DACA , while 34 percent said the opposite .
Mr. Mulvaney said the Trump administration would do its best to keep the partial shutdown from affecting most Americans , such as by keeping the national parks open , as opposed to the Obama shutdown , during which he said officials “ went out of their way to make it hurt more people and to be more visible . ”
About 800,000 federal employees are slated to be furloughed , but “ most Americans won ’ t see a difference , ” he said .
“ You go to the airport on Monday , the TSA [ Transportation Safety Administration ] will still be there , ” Mr. Mulvaney said . “ The military ’ s still at work . Now they ’ re not getting paid , and that ’ s wrong , but in terms of what you will see , it will not be as dramatic as you saw in 2013 . ”","White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said Sunday the difference between the 2013 and 2018 federal shutdowns is that President Barack Obama wanted it and President Trump didn’t.

“Compare 2013 and [2018] and how the two presidents have acted,” Mr. Mulvaney said on “Fox News Sunday.” “I went through the middle of 2013 — I think I was on your show during that shutdown — and I will look you in the eye and tell you that President Obama wanted that shutdown.”

Why? “He wanted to weaponize it. He wanted to use it politically to hurt Republicans because he thought Republicans would get blamed politically, and he wanted that shutdown,” the budget director said.

On the other hand, said Mr. Mulvaney, “this president has worked really, really hard to prevent the shutdown,” citing his meetings with congressional Democrats and Republicans.

Mr. Mulvaney served in the House during the 2013 shutdown, which saw part of the federal government close from Oct. 1 to Oct. 17 after Republicans balked at funding Obamacare.

This time, Senate Republicans were unable to round up enough votes to stave off a Democratic filibuster after Democrats pushed for a deal first on issues such as a permanent fix for the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.

“I don’t think anybody can say that this president wants this shutdown. You could not say the same thing about President Obama. In fact, I think he actually did want it,” said Mr. Mulvaney, who heads the Office of Management and Budget.

Indeed, Republicans did take the lion’s share of the blame for the 2013 partial shutdown, but which party will be held responsible for this year’s stalemate is unclear.

A Washington Post-ABC News poll released Friday, before funding expired at 12:01 a.m. Saturday, showed that 48 percent of those surveyed found Republicans responsible versus 28 percent who blamed Democrats and 18 percent who said both.

Then again, a CNN poll released the same day showed that 56 percent said it was more important to avoid a government shutdown than to extend DACA, while 34 percent said the opposite.

Mr. Mulvaney said the Trump administration would do its best to keep the partial shutdown from affecting most Americans, such as by keeping the national parks open, as opposed to the Obama shutdown, during which he said officials “went out of their way to make it hurt more people and to be more visible.”

About 800,000 federal employees are slated to be furloughed, but “most Americans won’t see a difference,” he said.

“You go to the airport on Monday, the TSA [Transportation Safety Administration] will still be there,” Mr. Mulvaney said. “The military’s still at work. Now they’re not getting paid, and that’s wrong, but in terms of what you will see, it will not be as dramatic as you saw in 2013.”

In nominating conservative appellate court judge Brett Kavanaugh to succeed retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court, President Trump has done something exceedingly normal.

That in itself is noteworthy.

During the opening weeks of the Trump administration, it became commonplace for liberal political observers to intone gravely that the Trump presidency — including the new president's words, actions, hiring choices, policy priorities, and ethical conflicts — was ""not normal."" Out of this focus on the administration's divergence from the normal came a debate that continues today — about the liberal democratic ""norms"" that the president, his Cabinet, and staffers routinely violate, placing America's form of government itself in jeopardy.

Such worries are legitimate. But the tendency of Trump critics to treat everything the administration does and everything the president says as abnormal remains concerning. That's why, in a column written a week after Trump's inauguration, I urged critics to separate out the administration's normal, abnormal, and truly alarming words and deeds.

Judged by that standard, Monday night's announcement of Kavanaugh's nomination to the high court was an utterly normal moment.

This would seem to imply that the mainstream Democratic position has arrived at the point where it considers not just President Trump's most egregious statements, behavior, and policies to be a truly alarming threat to liberal democracy in America — but longstanding, mainstream Republican positions an alarming threat, too.

That raises two significant and related dangers.

The first is the problem of crying wolf. Democrats have a long history of amping up the insults about Republican presidents and would-be presidents. Reagan's a doofus. Bush is a fascist. Romney's a racist. (Of course Republicans do the same thing with Democrats, labeling a moderate, incrementalist progressive like Barack Obama a radical and a socialist.)

Unless Democrats really do believe their own five-alarm hyperbole and now actually consider a conventional conservative jurist like Brett Kavanaugh to be a serious threat to the republic.

That is the second and far more ominous danger — whether or not it's true.

If that dire assessment of the peril posed by supposedly normal Republican ideas and goals is valid, then it means that one of the country's two parties poses something like an existential threat to our form of government — somewhat like the threat that an aggressive and potentially fatal form of cancer poses to the human body from the inside.

The difference between Democratic and Republican attitudes on Covid-19 was growing . Thirty-seven percent of Democrats , but 72 percent of Republicans , said they ’ d feel comfortable getting a haircut . Twenty-eight percent of Democrats , but 65 percent of Republicans , were willing to eat in a restaurant . Eight percent of Democrats , but 31 percent of Republicans , would attend a crowded party . All in all , the Pew poll found that partisanship was the single biggest driver of attitudes toward the coronavirus — dwarfing the effects of geography , age , gender , or race .
Now America ’ s coronavirus rate is on the rise , racing into uncharted territory even as Europe , Canada , and Japan hold new case rates to about 100 per million residents , or under . This chart is a stark reminder that the outbreak we ’ re experiencing isn ’ t an inevitability of the disease , but a staggering failure of policy and public health compliance :
Behind those lines lie the obvious mistakes and elite signals : States are reopening despite meeting few of the guidelines to end lockdowns . The president is holding indoor rallies , his campaign aides removing stickers encouraging social distancing at the venue . Masks have become part of America ’ s culture war . America is headed for a disaster driven not so much by the disease as by the politics that surround it .
“ America is the global exception right now , ” says Gregorio Millett , director of public policy at amFAR . “ Just look at the EU or New Zealand or countries across Asia . These places have vastly different cultures , different geographies , different institutions , different everything — but the one thing they have in common is that everyone is following public health measures . And they ’ ve all kept this virus at bay . Our leaders decided to politicize a scientific issue and as a result , our curve looks different than the rest of the world ’ s . ”
Which raises the question : Is political polarization literally killing us ?
There are two types of polarization worth separating out here : I ’ ll call them structural polarization and discretionary polarization .

The difference between Democratic and Republican attitudes on Covid-19 was growing. Thirty-seven percent of Democrats, but 72 percent of Republicans, said they’d feel comfortable getting a haircut. Twenty-eight percent of Democrats, but 65 percent of Republicans, were willing to eat in a restaurant. Eight percent of Democrats, but 31 percent of Republicans, would attend a crowded party. All in all, the Pew poll found that partisanship was the single biggest driver of attitudes toward the coronavirus — dwarfing the effects of geography, age, gender, or race.

Now America’s coronavirus rate is on the rise, racing into uncharted territory even as Europe, Canada, and Japan hold new case rates to about 100 per million residents, or under. This chart is a stark reminder that the outbreak we’re experiencing isn’t an inevitability of the disease, but a staggering failure of policy and public health compliance:

Behind those lines lie the obvious mistakes and elite signals: States are reopening despite meeting few of the guidelines to end lockdowns. The president is holding indoor rallies, his campaign aides removing stickers encouraging social distancing at the venue. Masks have become part of America’s culture war. America is headed for a disaster driven not so much by the disease as by the politics that surround it.

“America is the global exception right now,” says Gregorio Millett, director of public policy at amFAR. “Just look at the EU or New Zealand or countries across Asia. These places have vastly different cultures, different geographies, different institutions, different everything — but the one thing they have in common is that everyone is following public health measures. And they’ve all kept this virus at bay. Our leaders decided to politicize a scientific issue and as a result, our curve looks different than the rest of the world’s.”

Which raises the question: Is political polarization literally killing us?

The two types of polarization

There are two types of polarization worth separating out here: I’ll call them structural polarization and discretionary polarization.

Structural polarization stems from the core incentives of American politics. Elections are zero-sum affairs, and voters reward the majority party for successful, popular governance. The minority party’s default tendency to oppose the majority party’s signature initiatives is an example of structural polarization. It can be resisted or overcome, but it flows from the basic structure of our political system.

Discretionary polarization reflects the idiosyncratic decisions leaders make. Take face masks, for example. In an alternative universe, where President Mitt Romney is in the final year of his second term, would there be a politicized culture war over face masks? I doubt it. President Romney would be wearing a mask and urging others to do the same, just as Sen. Romney, and many of his colleagues, are doing now.

“We must have no stigma, none, about wearing masks when we leave our homes and come near other people,” Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the Senate floor. “Wearing simple face coverings is not about protecting ourselves, it is about protecting everyone we encounter. There is nothing cowardly about common courtesy.”

There is nothing intrinsic to the structure of American politics, or the composition of the Republican Party, that made Trump turn against masks. If anything, Trump’s opposition is an act against self-interest. A successful Covid-19 response would improve Trump’s reelection prospects. Widespread mask-wearing is key to a successful Covid-19 response. That Trump refused to wear a mask while touring a factory that makes masks reflects Trumpism, not polarization.

“I think we have to place this one pretty squarely on presidential leadership,” says political theorist Danielle Allen, head of Harvard’s Safra Center for Ethics. “Polarization hasn’t helped, but polarization, in this instance, has been driven by presidential leadership.”

In this way, Covid-19 is the exception that should remind us of the rule. Public health policies — and particularly public health emergencies — have often been an area of bipartisan unity, even in polarized times.

“There’s been bipartisan support for PEPFAR, for combating malaria globally, for tons of public health initiatives,” says Jennifer Kates, director of global health and HIV policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. “And those are for epidemics that aren’t happening primarily within our borders. The fact that this is happening right here and we still have this division is a tragedy and an aberration.”

Americans trusted Trump, and he misled them

Sara Wallace Goodman, a political scientist at the University of California Irvine, has been part of a team repeatedly surveying the same group of Americans to see how their behaviors and attitudes have changed over the course of the virus. Even controlling for factors like the prevalence of the disease in the place respondents live, Wallace Goodman and her colleagues find a significant and growing partisan gap in terms of fear of the disease, perceived safety of different behaviors, and preferred policy solutions.

The key to understanding this, Wallace Goodman says, is that “when people are operating in areas of high misinformation and lack of information, they take cues. We can only be rational if our leaders are rational. If you see the president not wearing a mask in meetings, you’re going to model what he does.”

This is, from a certain perspective, reasonable: The president has more information than you do, and if you’ve decided you trust him, then it makes sense to follow his lead. Few of us — liberal mask-wearers included — have personally conducted studies on the behavior of the novel coronavirus. We, too, are taking elite cues, listening to epidemiologists and science journalists and Dr. Anthony Fauci.

The central question in a political system is whom to trust. Once that decision has been made, everything else follows. The tragedy of American politics in 2020 is that many Americans sincerely trusted an untrustworthy man. And the cost of that mistake will be devastating, for Trump’s supporters and detractors alike.

“The virus doesn’t care if you’re a Democrat or Republican or live in the US or South Korea or France,” says Kates. “When things like politics define what people are willing to do and what laws are put in place, that can have deadly consequences.”

There were always going to be arguments over how best to respond to Covid-19, but it was Trump’s choice to politicize basic public health measures like face masks, to sideline scientists and hold indoor rallies, to waste the time bought by lockdowns in petty political fights and wild tweeting sprees.

There are signs that the harms of Trump’s failures are breaking through the firewall of polarization.

Disapproval of Trump has reached new highs; former Vice President Joe Biden is leading by almost 10 points in polling averages, and Republican satisfaction with the state of the country is in a nosedive.

But in this case, the political consequences will lag the human consequences, and no matter what happens in the election, the country has at least seven months left of Trump’s leadership.

“There was nothing inevitable about the polarized response to Covid-19,” says Wallace Goodman. “This outcome is a policy choice. The unnecessary lives lost. The long-term effects we don’t even know about yet on our vital organs. It’s all a policy choice.”

Past experience is not necessarily required (especially for Republicans).

Last March, more than a year before the first primaries, more voters valued a hypothetical candidate with “experience and a proven record” (50%) than one who had “new ideas and a different approach” (43%). Just six months later, those numbers had flipped – 55% said it was more important for a candidate to have new ideas, while 37% valued experience and a proven record.

Military experience is preferred, but increasingly rare.

While the public continues to view military experience very positively, it is a trait that none of the top remaining 2016 candidates possesses. In a survey last month, 50% of Americans said they would be more likely to vote for a presidential candidate who has served in the military – the most positively viewed trait among 13 tested.

For most voters, “electability” matters less than issue positions.

Policymakers work for their constituents, so if Republican voters are generally apathetic about the tremendous threats posed by climate change, party leaders have relatively little motivation to tackle the problem (aside from the obvious, like protecting future generations and the long-term viability of their political party).

However, the public responds to cues from intellectual and cultural leaders. Were Republican leaders to start listening to climate science experts, many of their voters would likely follow suit.

Conservative media climate denial is a root problem

Public perception and priorities are also heavily influenced by the media. A 2013 study found that conservative media consumers are more likely to distrust scientific experts and reject climate science realities.

Relatedly, a new report by Media Matters on climate coverage in major American newspaper opinion pages found pervasive misinformation in the Wall Street Journal.

A study last year found that the WSJ’s biased climate coverage extended beyond its opinion pages to its news coverage as well. And during the time of the scandalous #ExxonKnew revelations, Media Matters found that the WSJ was a constant apologist for the oil company.

The WSJ readership is heavily comprised of wealthy, powerful men, and it has become an increasingly conservative paper since Rupert Murdoch purchased it. Conservative media consumers are bombarded with climate misinformation and fossil fuel industry propaganda, usually without the authors’ fossil fuel ties being disclosed.



The industry has created an echo chamber in which they control the climate messaging of conservative media and party leaders, which in turn trickles down to misinform Republican voters, growing the partisan gap on climate change. The authors of the Oklahoma State study see no easy way break through what they call the “denial countermovement”:

consisting of fossil fuel corporations and business allies like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, conservative think tanks and their funders, conservative media, and a large supporting cast of front groups, bloggers, and contrarian scientists … Does any persuasive framing strategy hold special promise for penetrating Republicans’ partisan/ideological identities? The evidence so far gives little basis for optimism.

There’s plenty of blame to go around. Republican policymakers have failed to deliver much-needed leadership on climate change, American conservatives have relied too heavily on biased media sources, and conservative media outlets like Murdoch’s WSJ have misinformed their readers.

Democrats are tackling climate change on their own

Until the fossil fuel industry’s control over conservative policymakers and media loosens, American climate action will be up to the Democratic Party. This weekend, President Obama and Chinese President Xi announced they will formally ratify the Paris climate change agreement. If she is elected president, Hillary Clinton likewise plans to rely on executive actions to tackle climate change.

But there’s a limit to what the President of the United States can do on his or her own. US Congress still controls American climate policy, or the lack thereof. As long as the conservative media continues to misinform readers and breed a conservative culture of climate denial, American efforts to tackle the threat of climate change will be constrained, and the future of human society and of the Republican Party will be endangered.

On Tuesday , DeGeneres addressed the controversy during her show . She highlighted a supportive tweet from someone who wrote , `` Seeing Ellen and George Bush together makes me have faith in America again . ''
`` Here 's the thing , '' said DeGeneres . `` I 'm friends with George Bush . In fact , I 'm friends with a lot of people who do n't share the same beliefs I have . We 're all different and I think that we 've forgotten that 's okay that we 're all different . ''

I 'm with Ellen . This perspective is sadly all-too-often absent from our current cultural dialogue , with its emphasis on canceling anyone and everyone who did or said something wrong .

It was noteworthy because of whom she was seated next to: former President George W. Bush. The pair could be seen in pictures and a video clip enjoying the afternoon together. (Their respective partners, Arrested Development actress Portia de Rossi and former first lady Laura Bush, were there too.)

In 2019, everything must be political. And so the news that DeGeneres could make it through an entire football game seated next to the odiously conservative Bush and actually have a good time made people very mad. You will not be surprised to learn that some took to social media to vent. Here is a sampling of what they had to say.

ellen degeneres is rehabilitating a war criminal and any liberal who buys into the lie that gwb is a sweet old man is a trog — hasanabi (@hasanthehun) October 8, 2019

george w bush literally ran for reelection on a constitutional amendment so @TheEllenShow would be barred from being able to marry. i know theyre both rich but that's not a mere ""difference of opinion."" thats an attempt to make one person less of a person than the other. — Oliver Willis (@owillis) October 8, 2019

This is what Bush brought Iraqi families, daily, for his oil friends. @TheEllenShow and @gwenstefani are patting themselves on the back for rainbow capitalism, comparing a war criminal to ""disagreements"" while actively sanitizing them in service of endless greed and selfishness. pic.twitter.com/dhwxZOehQi — rafael (@rafaelshimunov) October 8, 2019

On Tuesday, DeGeneres addressed the controversy during her show. She highlighted a supportive tweet from someone who wrote, ""Seeing Ellen and George Bush together makes me have faith in America again.""

""Here's the thing,"" said DeGeneres. ""I'm friends with George Bush. In fact, I'm friends with a lot of people who don't share the same beliefs I have. We're all different and I think that we've forgotten that's okay that we're all different.""

Yes, that was me at the Cowboys game with George W. Bush over the weekend. Here's the whole story. pic.twitter.com/AYiwY5gTIS — Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) October 8, 2019

""Just because I don't agree with someone on everything doesn't mean I'm not going to be friends with them,"" DeGeneres continued. ""When I say, 'Be kind to one another,' I don't mean only the people that think the same way that you do.""

I'm with Ellen. This perspective is sadly all-too-often absent from our current cultural dialogue, with its emphasis on canceling anyone and everyone who did or said something wrong. It's becoming harder and harder for people to get along with each other, and be civil toward one another, when they disagree about the issues—even though, as Reason Senior Editor Brian Doherty has persuasively argued, it's rarely a good idea to end a relationship over politics.

Something helped hold us together as a nation in 1968. Time and again, it was sports.

The two teams that met in the World Series that season — the Detroit Tigers and St. Louis Cardinals — had such stars as Al Kaline and Willie Horton, and Curt Flood and Bob Gibson. They not only excelled between the lines but also took major roles in their communities.

Horton grew up in the Detroit Jeffries Projects, only blocks away from where the worst riots since the Civil War had occurred in late July 1967, a harbinger for the “long, hot summer” to follow. Horton hurried to the scene as soon as the Tigers game was over, still dressed in his uniform. There, Horton climbed atop the hood of a car and pleaded for people to stop, to go home. Unfortunately, not enough listened. Those five days of turmoil resulted in 43 dead and 7,231 arrested.

“People like to talk about courage, throw that word around,” Denny McLain, Horton’s teammate, told me. “But that’s one of the bravest things I ever heard about.”

Integrating athletes

A generation ago, the gestures and decisions that held us together were large and small, and they were often found in sports. When the Tigers began their drive to the pennant in 1968, police soon realized that a people gathering on the streets weren’t necessarily looking for trouble. More often than not in 1968, they were clustered around someone with a transistor radio, listening to Detroit’s Ernie Harwell call the play-by-play, as the Tigers rallied 40 times in the seventh inning or later that season.

That same summer, in a different sport, Joe Namath made sure his New York Jets didn’t divide along racial lines. Sports Illustrated writer Paul Zimmerman observed that the charismatic quarterback usually sat with black teammates at the team training table, “and then a few white players joined him, and soon it becomes a mixed table. I’ve seen this happen too many times (with Namath) to assume it’s accidental.”

That’s perhaps the saving grace about sports. The games may be a diversion, but they also remind us of what can be accomplished when we come together as a people. The best teams invariably find a way to move past what can divide them and focus on a common goal. The Cardinals, Tigers, Jets and so many other champions have followed that example.

“We want you up,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo recently told sports teams in his state. “We want people to be able to watch sports. … It gives people something to do. It’s a return to normalcy.”

MLB players and owners

Despite such enthusiasm, any chance for an abbreviated season in Major League Baseball will soon end unless the players’ union and owners can solve two riddles: health assurances and payroll concerns.

The NFL appears ready to return sometime this fall, depending upon any pandemic spike. Yet some haven’t forgotten the game’s treatment of another charismatic quarterback, Colin Kaepernick. His protest — that of taking a knee — seems tame with what’s playing out in the nation now.

A different take:Sports can be the great healer, but we're not there yet

Elsewhere, more athletes are becoming involved and trying to lead. But they will have to go some to fill the footsteps from 1968. At least “50 star athletes, former athletes and coaches” supported Robert Kennedy’s presidential campaign that year, according to The New York Times, and their ranks included Hank Aaron, Bill Russell, Gale Sayers and Vince Lombardi.

Some contend that big money has irreparably altered our relationship between professional athletes and their fans. The salaries have soared so high, sports stars don’t live in our neighborhoods anymore. Indeed, in 1968, some players had to find second jobs in the off-season to make ends meet. Many served in the National Guard, such as Mickey Lolich and Nolan Ryan, while the Vietnam War raged.

Still, there is something about an epic sports game or performance that alleviates, even unites us. A half-century ago, pitcher Bob Gibson realized that “there was no escaping the pervasive realities of 1968 — the assassination, the cities burning, the social revolution.”

The Cardinals’ ace pitched his first shutout of the season the same day as Robert Kennedy’s assassination. While Gibson couldn’t decide whether that tragic event, which occurred two months after Martin Luther King Jr.’s death, “got me going or not. Without a doubt, it was an angry point in American history for black people — Dr. King’s killing jolted me; Kennedy’s infuriated me.”

Gibson would go on to post a 1.12 ERA for the season, a record in the live-ball era. Those who saw him take the mound in such tumultuous times, and the courage and conviction he exhibited, will never forget it.

The Cook Political Report says polarization is due less to gerrymandering than it is to where people choose to live.

SCOTT SIMON, HOST:

There's new data this week that may confirm this country is more polarized not only state by state but zip code by zip code, maybe even house by house and apartment by apartment. The venerable Cook Political Report says the common wisdom, of course, is that incumbents have redrawn the lines of districts - gerrymandered is the term - to favor their re-election. The number of swing districts - a term that means residents could vote for either party, not that the district has a swinging good time at parties over the weekend - has become very small. The reporters at Cook say that gerrymandering, quote, ""is only responsible for a small portion"" of what they call the swing seat decimation.

They've produced their partisan voter index for the past 20 years. And on this year's edition, out this week, they say natural geographic sorting has taken place over the past couple of decades. Liberals have moved next to liberals, conservatives next to conservatives. It used to be the rule just not to bring up politics in polite company. Now imagine a real estate ad - two-bedroom, one-and-a-half-bath, cul-de-sac, good schools, nice neighbors, no people of the other party need apply.

Our collapsed institutions have been supplanted by virtual communities.

Ever since Donald Trump touched the Orb, praise be upon it, I’ve been making “This is what you get when you touch the Orb” jokes.

If you don’t know what I’m talking about, I’ll tell you: On his trip to the Middle East in May, President Trump, along with the Saudi king and the president of Egypt, laid his hands on a glowing white orb for two minutes (which strikes me as a long time to touch an orb).

The image was like a mix of J.R.R. Tolkien and 1970s low-budget Canadian sci-fi. It looked like they were calling forth powerful eldritch energies from the chthonic depths or perhaps the forbidden zone.

Ever since then, when things have gotten weird, I’ve credited the Orb. For instance, when the Guardian reported that sex between Japanese snow monkeys and Sika deer may now constitute a new “behavioral tradition,” I tweeted, “the Orb has game, you can’t deny it.” When Roy Moore, the GOP Alabama Senate candidate, was plausibly accused of preying on teenagers and many Evangelical leaders rallied to his defense, invoking biblical justifications for groping young girls, I admired the Orb’s cunning. And when the bunkered Moore decided to give one of his only interviews to a twelve-year-old girl, I sat back and marveled at the Orb’s dark sense of humor.

But I know in my heart that it’s not the Orb’s fault things have gotten so weird, for the simple reason that rampant weirdness predates the Orb-touching by years.

I have a partial theory as to why, and it doesn’t begin with Trump. It begins with a failure of elites and the institutions they run.

Nearly three-fourths of Americans cannot identify all three branches of the federal government, according to an Annenberg Public Policy Center poll taken earlier this year. One in three Americans can’t name a single branch of government. More than a third of Americans can’t name any of their rights under the First Amendment. Multiple surveys find that Americans, particularly younger Americans, are increasingly ambivalent, or downright hostile, to free speech and democracy.

Even as knowledge of, and commitment to, our system of government has been eroding, partisan loyalty has radically intensified. Some studies find that partisan identification is now at least as predictive of behavior and attitudes as race or gender. As we lose our old meaningful attachments, we find new ones in shallow tribalism.

These trends have been in the pipeline for a long time, and while one can point a curmudgeonly finger of blame at the people, particularly these kids today, that wouldn’t be fair. Many older Americans haven’t exactly been model citizens either. Dismayed with the direction of American politics, they often grew as angry at the system as the young radicals. The real blame falls to elites of all stripes and ages — political, journalistic, economic, and educational. Every generation has a responsibility to instruct the next on what is important. As an empirical matter, they — we — failed.

The failure runs deeper, though. Throughout American history, institutions outside of the government — Alexis de Tocqueville called them “associations” — have played a vital role in binding people together and giving them a sense of meaning and rootedness. Our politics, both national and local, were always downstream of these institutions.

That intricate ecosystem has been supplanted by virtual communities, which serve not so much to educate and civilize but to reinforce pre-established beliefs. Elites who once guided media outlets, universities, and even rotary clubs to temper and channel anger have been replaced by leaders who are more like followers, chasing the online mobs wherever they want to go. And all eyes are on Washington to solve our problems. Our politics, in other words, are upstream now.

The norms we’ve come to rely on no longer match the landscape. Like Japanese snow monkeys, we’re creating new “behavioral traditions.”

In this, Trump is less an aberration than a leader for his time. In his rhetorical contempt for free speech, his ignorance of basic constitutional facts, his addiction to drama and ratings, his personalization of every political question and conflict, and his uncanny ability to bring out the same qualities in his biggest detractors, he breathes new life into H. L. Mencken’s definition of democracy as “the theory that the common people know what they want and deserve to get it good and hard.”

But what of judicial polarization ? In new research which examines polarization in the US Supreme Court since 1938 , Donald Gooch finds that this polarization has also increased , and correlates with congressional and presidential polarization . He argues that this trend is fed by shifts in ideological polarization in the Senate , and in public opinion . If it continues , he writes , polarization may lead to more frequent and powerful attacks on the Supreme Court ’ s authority and supremacy .
Scholars have long warned of a growing political schism in the American body politic . Popularized by “ Red vs. Blue ” maps in national elections , political polarization is defined as a widening divide between partisan identifiers and ideologues in the public and political elite . Political polarization is one of the most important recent developments in American politics . Concerns about political polarization in American politics focus on its potential to frustrate political accommodation , stymie political actors , clog political processes , disrupt political institutional environments and , in the extreme , spur violent social unrest . For example , the congressional polarization that emerged in the 1970s has only intensified over time . Polarization has led to greater gridlock , greater partisan rancor between the parties , and greater intraparty cohesion in congressional politics .
The majority of institutional polarization studies emphasize Congress . Judicial polarization , in contrast , is underexplored as an aspect of political polarization and as a determinant of judicial behavior . By examining individual justice polarization and ideological extremity over full tenures on the United States Supreme Court since 1938 and how Court polarization responds to polarization in coordinate institutions over the same time period , I find : strong evidence of increasing Court polarization and that Court polarization correlates with congressional and presidential polarization since the 1950s . Court polarization is a real and significant political phenomenon in America .
Figure 1 shows the normalized polarization trends in the Court ’ s institutional environment across the regimes of Chief Justices . It depicts polarization trends for the Supreme Court , the Senate ( standard deviation of senator ideology per congressional term ) , and the President vis-à-vis the Senate chamber median ( absolute difference between President ’ s ideology score and the median Senator ’ s ideology score ) . Notice the strong apparent linear trend over time in the polarization of all three institutions , interrupted only by the drop in polarization observed between the Senate chamber median and the President during the Vinson regime . The strength of the correlation between the President-Senate chamber median difference and that of Court polarization over the regimes is striking . A remarkable consistency exists in the peaks and valleys of Court polarization and the ideological distance between the President and the Senate chamber median across chief justice regimes from Hughes to Roberts .
Figure 1 – Polarization Trends in Senate , President-Senate , and Court Polarization ( JCS ) across Chief Justice Regimes
What is the most parsimonious explanation for these results ? An increasingly polarized Senate , through its advice-and-consent role , has produced a mirror image of itself on the Court . Court and Senate polarization may , in turn , be a function of polarization in the American electorate . Thus , even though the Court is somewhat insulated from democratic forces , the Court is subject to macro-polarization trends ( directly and indirectly ) through the institutional context . The Court is responsive to the polarization of entrepreneurial interest groups , such as the Federalist Society ( conservative ) and the Coalition for a Fair and Independent Judiciary ( liberal ) .
Justices evolve ideologically over time . The evidence on Court polarization suggests that ideological movement on the Court tends to be in one direction—justices tend to become more liberal the longer they are on the Court . Consider two examples : Harry Blackmun and Clarence Thomas In 1970 , Harry Blackmun served his first term on the Court . At the time , only Chief Justice Burger was more conservative than Blackmun . In his tenth term on the Court , Justice Blackmun crossed the ideological Rubicon , joining the Court ’ s left-leaning justices ( Figure 2 ) . By his final term in 1993 , Justice Blackmun was as far to the Court ’ s ideological left as he had been to the Court ’ s ideological right when he began his career . As a second example , Justice Clarence Thomas , is widely considered to be a stalwart of conservatism on the Court . He holds the extreme rightward location in the judicial common space . Even Justice Thomas , however , has evolved ideologically over his career . Unlike Blackmun , Thomas has moved further to the right . Justice Thomas ’ s absolute ideological evolution is only half that of Blackmun ’ s , but Thomas has become nearly twice as conservative as he was when he first joined the Court .
Figure 2 – Career Trends in JCS scores for Justice Thomas and Justice Blackmun
What explains this ideological drift ? These ideological sojourns are not made in a vacuum . Just as Court polarization is a function of the Court ’ s internal and external environments , individual justices are buffeted by internal and external factors during their judicial decision-making . Justices are part of the Brethren , a small clique of specialized judicial actors . Thus , they may be influenced by the strategic internal judicial environment and interpersonal justice relationships . The Court exists in a unique and competitive institutional context . This context constrains judicial behavior . Justices are responsive to mass and elite public opinion . There is strong evidence justices evolve ideologically on the Court in response to shifts in the ideological polarization in the Senate . Other external factors create leftward headwinds . The Court is responsive to legal elites and legal institutions shaping the debate over judicial policy . Institutions like the American Bar Association reflect the liberal tilt among legal professionals ; these institutions help establish a range of judicial policies acceptable to the leftward shifted legal elite . Favorable press coverage of justices becoming more liberal , the so-called “ Greenhouse Effect , ” may induce more justices to evolve in the left ideological direction . Within , justices may serve as ideological lodestones , drawing fellow justices to their own ideological viewpoint . My analysis suggests that this movement is not merely a function of drift , but rather the consequence of the political environment within which the Court makes policy . Elite polarization entrepreneurs , public opinion shaped by media coverage , and institutional constraints may all play a part in causing justices to move to the Left over their careers .
What are the implications of this analysis ? Court polarization and polarization in the Court ’ s strategic environment influence justice ideological disposition and evolution . These two types of Court polarization may have wide-ranging effects on : the judicial nomination process , the Senate judicial confirmation process , and , subsequently , the policy output of the Court . Ideological polarization influences competition between the branches over policy . Justices becoming more liberal over time influences policy debates concerning the life-tenure of justices . It could change how presidents , particularly Republican presidents , choose nominees for the Court . The emergent ideological polarization on the Court has profound implications for how the Court will figure in the national political discourse and how its interactions with polarization forces will affect the constitutional order . A polarized Court is more vulnerable to the attacks of reconstructive presidents . Presidents may take advantage of Court polarization to politicize Court decisions in a bid to detract from the Court ’ s constitutional authority and to challenge judicial supremacy .
Polarization bodes ill for the prospects of consensus among the branches on constitutional meaning . President Obama ’ s 2010 State of the Union challenge to the Supreme Court over Citizens United and Justice Alito ’ s “ not true ” rejoinder is illustrative of the Court-president conflict that polarization may engender . Polarization may lead to more frequent and more powerful attacks on judicial authority and judicial supremacy . These implications make it clear that judicial polarization is an important phenomenon of the U.S. Supreme Court and a topic ripe for further study .

polarization,Washington Post,0,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/05/15/biden-has-4-great-options-black-female-vp-one-is-his-best/,Biden has four great options for a black female running mate. One is his best.,2020-05-15,"Jonathan Capehart, Cultural Issues, Opinion Writer","Now comes the parlor game of figuring out who that black woman should be .
Biden knows how important it is to have an empowered governing partner who commands respect inside and outside the White House . That ’ s who he was as vice president to former president Barack Obama , and Biden is right to want the same for himself .
Before I list some popular choices , let me obliterate an argument that has cropped up in response to my first post . When folks say that whomever Biden selects should be the most qualified or that “ identity politics only gets you so far , ” they should be aware of how that hits the African American ear . Since Jim Crow , such sentiments have been used to question our abilities and snuff out our ambitions . No matter how brilliant we are , we are never brilliant enough in a world that still believes someone not straight or white or male ( usually all three ) is inherently unqualified for any role , let alone being a heartbeat away from the presidency .
The four black women most often mentioned as a possible Biden running mate defy that racist notion . They are worthy of the speculation .
Stacey Abrams was the Democratic leader of the Georgia House of Representatives for six years before she resigned her seat to run for governor in the 2018 election . Abrams won the Democratic nomination with 76.5 percent of the vote . Had Abrams prevailed in the general election , she would have been the first African American female governor in the United States .
Abrams lost the race to Republican Brian Kemp by just 55,000 votes . He was the Georgia secretary of state , where he oversaw elections in Georgia for eight years . In that time , according to New York magazine , Kemp went about “ purging 1.4 million voters from the rolls , placing thousands of registrations on hold , and overseeing the closure or relocation of nearly half of the state ’ s precincts and polling sites . ”
Abrams was born in Wisconsin and raised in Gulfport , Miss . Her mother was a college librarian . Her father worked in a shipyard . When Abrams was in high school , the family moved to Atlanta , where both of her parents became Methodist ministers . Abrams would get her bachelor ’ s degree from Spelman College , a masters in public administration from the University of Texas at Austin and a law degree from Yale . Abrams now runs Fair Fight , an organization she started after the governor ’ s race to focus on suppression in 20 states .
Abrams ’ s name has been on the lips of Democrats since she almost won Georgia in 2018 . She nailed one of the toughest assignments in politics when she delivered the Democratic response to Trump ’ s 2019 State of the Union address . And Abrams has been the boldest of all the potential picks in her pursuit of the vice-presidential nod . When I interviewed her at the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum last December , I asked her if she would want to do it . “ I ’ m a black woman who ’ s in a conversation about possibly being second in command to the leader of the free world , and I will not diminish my ambition or the ambition of any other women of color by saying that ’ s not something I ’ d be willing to do , ” Abrams said to thunderous applause . She has repeated some form of that answer at every opportunity ever since .
Rep. Val Demings ( D-Fla. ) has been in Congress since 2017 . The Jacksonville native , whose district includes Orlando , had a front-row seat to impeachment as a member of the House Intelligence Committee , the House Judiciary Committee and as one of the seven impeachment managers arguing the case against Trump before the Senate .
Investigating the president was no stretch for Demings . She spent 27 years in the Orlando Police Department , becoming the city ’ s first female police chief . But she wasn ’ t the first African American . That distinction belongs to her husband Jerry L. Demings , who is now the mayor of Orange County , Fla. , the first African American elected to that post . The Demingses are a Harley-Davidson-riding power couple in Florida ’ s all-important I-4 corridor whose individual achievements are the embodiment of the American dream .
The visual of a black female former police chief helping to make the case for the rule of law against the president had many in the Democratic Party in full swoon . During an interview in March , I asked Demings if she ’ d be interested in being vice president . She leaned into her blue-collar roots .
“ I grew up the daughter of a maid and a janitor . I grew up poor , black and female in the South , someone who was told a lot of times that I wasn ’ t the right color or gender . But my mother pushed me and said , ‘ No , you can make it . If you work hard and play by the rules , you can be anything you wan na be and do anything you wan na do , ’ ” Demings said . “ So the fact that my name is being called in such a special way for such an important position during such a critical time , it ’ s such an honor . ”
Sen. Kamala D. Harris ( D-Calif. ) came to Washington in 2017 after serving six years as the attorney general for California and two full terms as district attorney of San Francisco . Harris joined the race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination in January 2019 but ended her campaign in December .
Harris is the daughter of immigrants . Her late mother was a breast cancer researcher from India . Her father is an emeritus professor of economics at Stanford University from Jamaica . They divorced when Harris was 7 years old . Harris graduated from Howard University , where her identity as an African American woman was cemented . She returned to California to get her law degree at the University of California at Hastings .
In “ The Truths We Hold : An American Journey , ” Harris writes that fighting injustice was a major part of her upbringing . Her decision to become a prosecutor took her family by surprise . In an interview with Harris that I did in conjunction with her book tour in Washington in January 2019 , she said , “ I had to defend my decision like one would a thesis. ” She then made her argument before the audience , saying , “ What I tried to live in my career as a prosecutor is the understanding that , in that role , you have the power to be the voice of the most vulnerable among us . ''
Harris came to Washington with presidential buzz already around her , which only increased as she questioned Trump administration officials . She so flustered then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions at one hearing that he admitted Harris ’ s questioning “ makes me nervous . ”
Harris jumped into the race for the presidential nomination before a crowd of more than 20,000 people in her hometown of Oakland last January . ( Disclosure : My husband volunteered at that event . ) Her debate performances had memorable moments , including when Harris went after Biden over his past stance on busing . The resulting bump in polling Harris received was fleeting . She ended her campaign before a primary vote was cast . But the VP buzz grew louder . When Harris has been asked about being Biden ’ s running mate , all she will say is she would be honored .
Susan Rice was the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under President Barack Obama in his first term and then served as his national security adviser in his second term .
If you read her memoir , “ Tough Love : My story of the things worth fighting for , ” you know that Rice was reared in the elite circles of Washington . Her mother was known as the “ mother of the Pell Grant. ” Her father was a Tuskegee Airman and economist who was appointed by President Jimmy Carter as a governor of the Federal Reserve Board , the second African American to hold such a post .
A graduate of Stanford and a Rhodes Scholar with a master ’ s and a Ph.D in international relations from Oxford , Rice ’ s first foray in government was as assistant secretary of state for African affairs in the Clinton administration . She has never run for elective office . Nevertheless , she has been battle-tested in the partisan crucible of Washington and the fever swamps of Fox News . See , Benghazi .
Rice has been unsparing in her criticism of Trump ’ s response to the coronavirus and uses language that scratches deep that itch among Democrats to take the fight to the president . “ He has demonstrated utter lack of leadership , utter incompetence , ” Rice told me last month .
When I asked her what she thought about the Biden running-mate talk , Rice responded via email , “ I am honored to be among the highly accomplished women mentioned as possible VP candidates . I have great admiration for Joe Biden . Biden will be an excellent president , and I am committed to doing my utmost to help him win and govern effectively . ”
At a virtual fundraiser last month , Biden said , “ I view myself as a transition candidate. ” If elected , he would be the oldest sitting president in U.S. history and would lead a nation in desperate need of stability and leadership from the White House .

Biden must give African Americans a reason to vote . A Biden-Harris ticket is a reason to vote .","Now comes the parlor game of figuring out who that black woman should be.

Biden knows how important it is to have an empowered governing partner who commands respect inside and outside the White House. That’s who he was as vice president to former president Barack Obama, and Biden is right to want the same for himself.

Before I list some popular choices, let me obliterate an argument that has cropped up in response to my first post. When folks say that whomever Biden selects should be the most qualified or that “identity politics only gets you so far,” they should be aware of how that hits the African American ear. Since Jim Crow, such sentiments have been used to question our abilities and snuff out our ambitions. No matter how brilliant we are, we are never brilliant enough in a world that still believes someone not straight or white or male (usually all three) is inherently unqualified for any role, let alone being a heartbeat away from the presidency.

The four black women most often mentioned as a possible Biden running mate defy that racist notion. They are worthy of the speculation.

Stacey Abrams was the Democratic leader of the Georgia House of Representatives for six years before she resigned her seat to run for governor in the 2018 election. Abrams won the Democratic nomination with 76.5 percent of the vote. Had Abrams prevailed in the general election, she would have been the first African American female governor in the United States.

AD

Abrams lost the race to Republican Brian Kemp by just 55,000 votes. He was the Georgia secretary of state, where he oversaw elections in Georgia for eight years. In that time, according to New York magazine, Kemp went about “purging 1.4 million voters from the rolls, placing thousands of registrations on hold, and overseeing the closure or relocation of nearly half of the state’s precincts and polling sites.”

Abrams was born in Wisconsin and raised in Gulfport, Miss. Her mother was a college librarian. Her father worked in a shipyard. When Abrams was in high school, the family moved to Atlanta, where both of her parents became Methodist ministers. Abrams would get her bachelor’s degree from Spelman College, a masters in public administration from the University of Texas at Austin and a law degree from Yale. Abrams now runs Fair Fight, an organization she started after the governor’s race to focus on suppression in 20 states.

Why folks are talking about her

Abrams’s name has been on the lips of Democrats since she almost won Georgia in 2018. She nailed one of the toughest assignments in politics when she delivered the Democratic response to Trump’s 2019 State of the Union address. And Abrams has been the boldest of all the potential picks in her pursuit of the vice-presidential nod. When I interviewed her at the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum last December, I asked her if she would want to do it. “I’m a black woman who’s in a conversation about possibly being second in command to the leader of the free world, and I will not diminish my ambition or the ambition of any other women of color by saying that’s not something I’d be willing to do,” Abrams said to thunderous applause. She has repeated some form of that answer at every opportunity ever since.

Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.) has been in Congress since 2017. The Jacksonville native, whose district includes Orlando, had a front-row seat to impeachment as a member of the House Intelligence Committee, the House Judiciary Committee and as one of the seven impeachment managers arguing the case against Trump before the Senate.

Investigating the president was no stretch for Demings. She spent 27 years in the Orlando Police Department, becoming the city’s first female police chief. But she wasn’t the first African American. That distinction belongs to her husband Jerry L. Demings, who is now the mayor of Orange County, Fla., the first African American elected to that post. The Demingses are a Harley-Davidson-riding power couple in Florida’s all-important I-4 corridor whose individual achievements are the embodiment of the American dream.

Why folks are talking about her

The visual of a black female former police chief helping to make the case for the rule of law against the president had many in the Democratic Party in full swoon. During an interview in March, I asked Demings if she’d be interested in being vice president. She leaned into her blue-collar roots.

“I grew up the daughter of a maid and a janitor. I grew up poor, black and female in the South, someone who was told a lot of times that I wasn’t the right color or gender. But my mother pushed me and said, ‘No, you can make it. If you work hard and play by the rules, you can be anything you wanna be and do anything you wanna do,’” Demings said. “So the fact that my name is being called in such a special way for such an important position during such a critical time, it’s such an honor.”

Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) came to Washington in 2017 after serving six years as the attorney general for California and two full terms as district attorney of San Francisco. Harris joined the race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination in January 2019 but ended her campaign in December.

Harris is the daughter of immigrants. Her late mother was a breast cancer researcher from India. Her father is an emeritus professor of economics at Stanford University from Jamaica. They divorced when Harris was 7 years old. Harris graduated from Howard University, where her identity as an African American woman was cemented. She returned to California to get her law degree at the University of California at Hastings.

In “The Truths We Hold: An American Journey,” Harris writes that fighting injustice was a major part of her upbringing. Her decision to become a prosecutor took her family by surprise. In an interview with Harris that I did in conjunction with her book tour in Washington in January 2019, she said, “I had to defend my decision like one would a thesis.” She then made her argument before the audience, saying, “What I tried to live in my career as a prosecutor is the understanding that, in that role, you have the power to be the voice of the most vulnerable among us.""

Harris came to Washington with presidential buzz already around her, which only increased as she questioned Trump administration officials. She so flustered then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions at one hearing that he admitted Harris’s questioning “makes me nervous.”

Harris jumped into the race for the presidential nomination before a crowd of more than 20,000 people in her hometown of Oakland last January. (Disclosure: My husband volunteered at that event.) Her debate performances had memorable moments, including when Harris went after Biden over his past stance on busing. The resulting bump in polling Harris received was fleeting. She ended her campaign before a primary vote was cast. But the VP buzz grew louder. When Harris has been asked about being Biden’s running mate, all she will say is she would be honored.

Susan Rice was the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under President Barack Obama in his first term and then served as his national security adviser in his second term.

If you read her memoir, “Tough Love: My story of the things worth fighting for,” you know that Rice was reared in the elite circles of Washington. Her mother was known as the “mother of the Pell Grant.” Her father was a Tuskegee Airman and economist who was appointed by President Jimmy Carter as a governor of the Federal Reserve Board, the second African American to hold such a post.

A graduate of Stanford and a Rhodes Scholar with a master’s and a Ph.D in international relations from Oxford, Rice’s first foray in government was as assistant secretary of state for African affairs in the Clinton administration. She has never run for elective office. Nevertheless, she has been battle-tested in the partisan crucible of Washington and the fever swamps of Fox News. See, Benghazi.

Rice has been unsparing in her criticism of Trump’s response to the coronavirus and uses language that scratches deep that itch among Democrats to take the fight to the president. “He has demonstrated utter lack of leadership, utter incompetence,” Rice told me last month.

When I asked her what she thought about the Biden running-mate talk, Rice responded via email, “I am honored to be among the highly accomplished women mentioned as possible VP candidates. I have great admiration for Joe Biden. Biden will be an excellent president, and I am committed to doing my utmost to help him win and govern effectively.”

At a virtual fundraiser last month, Biden said, “I view myself as a transition candidate.” If elected, he would be the oldest sitting president in U.S. history and would lead a nation in desperate need of stability and leadership from the White House. Therefore, Biden needs to choose a future vice president who is young enough to embody the transition he envisions while also being a governing partner. That person has been staring us in the face for months now. Her name is Kamala Harris.

Most probability-based political and social surveys of the general public in the United States continue to be conducted by telephone. In most of these surveys, respondents are interviewed only once. This model of conducting surveys is facing serious challenges as response rates drop, costs increase and newer alternative methods present appealing alternatives.

One alternative that is hardly new, but is attracting renewed attention, is the panel survey. Panel surveys involve repeated interviews with the same pool of respondents over time. Panels have been around for decades, and high-quality, probability-based panels (those recruited through random samples of the population) are an integral part of the federal statistical system. Panels recruited through non-probability methods or “convenience” samples have found widespread applicability in the market research world. But with a very small number of notable exceptions, panels have not been widely used by organizations committed to conducting probability-based political and social surveys on a regular basis. This is changing.

Several features of panels make them an appealing alternative to one-time, “cross-sectional” surveys. The initial costs of recruiting a panel, while potentially large, can be amortized over time because the panel can yield multiple individual surveys at relatively lower marginal costs per survey. Over time, far more can be learned about the panelists’ social, demographic and political characteristics than is feasible in a single survey. Related to this, external databases of information about panelists, such as voter and consumer files, can be integrated with survey responses to yield additional insights. Panels allow for the measurement of individual-level change over time, something that is not possible with cross-sectional surveys. Moreover, panels make it relatively easy to use multiple modes of interviewing. In particular, self-administration using Web or a paper questionnaire has desirable characteristics for the measurement of many kinds of attitudes and behaviors. And perhaps most obvious, follow-up studies are ideally facilitated in a panel design.

With these advantages in mind, Pew Research Center set out in early 2014 to build a probability-based panel — the American Trends Panel — to supplement our traditional method of data collection in the U.S. — the random digit dial (RDD) telephone survey. This report describes the steps taken to build and manage the panel and our experiences with it in 2014.

Panel Models

Probability-based survey panels come in many varieties. Some attempt to be representative of the entire population, while others focus on subgroups such as teens or young adults. Some involve nearly continuous interviewing, while others may collect data once a year or even less frequently. We envisioned creating a panel of randomly selected adults that would represent the U.S. adult population and could be used for social and political surveys similar to those we conduct with cross-sectional samples. Our goal was to collect data from panelists about once per month. We wanted most surveys to be self-administered, rather than interviewer-administered.

They were then asked to rate themselves politically on a scale of one ( extremely liberal ) to seven ( extremely conservative ) , and to give their views on three hot-button issues .
`` 'Remain ' supporters felt more disillusioned , '' the researchers report , `` which in turn predicted more extreme left-wing views . ''
The second study featured 243 Americans who were surveyed the week before , and again the week after , the 2016 presidential election . On both occasions , they indicated their level of disillusionment . Their political ideology was measured by the strength of their agreement with statements such as `` Health care should be provided by our government and accessible to all . ''
`` The results of the election led to increased disillusionment levels among Clinton voters , '' the researchers write , `` which in turn predicted a shift toward a more left-wing political stance . '' In contrast , Trump voters did not feel more disillusioned , and their ideological positions remained the same .
The final study featured 234 people recruited online . Half were asked to `` think of a worldwide issue that makes you feel most disillusioned ; '' the others were instructed to ponder `` an ordinary event in your life . '' All were asked to describe the topic , and the emotions it evokes in them , in detail .
WHAT DEMOLITION DERBY REVEALS ABOUT SMALL-TOWN POLITICS AND THE TRUMP APOCALYPSE : There is no single storyline to demolition derby . Unlike a football game , there is no ground to take , no points to score . There is only mayhem and survival .
They then noted how disillusioned they were feeling , and replied to statements such as `` After ( doing this ) writing , I am motivated to find more meaning . '' Finally , they were asked how likely it was they would engage in future political activities , including those that involve illegal actions .
Not surprisingly , those who wrote about disillusionment felt that emotion more strongly than those who did not . Tellingly , they also `` reported more extreme political activism intentions . '' This was true for both liberals and conservatives .
Maher and Igou conclude that `` to halt the slide into cumulative polarization , the underlying causes of mass disillusionment should be addressed . '' That wo n't be easy : It 'll require reversing the prejudice-reinforcing media habits we 've acquired in the cable news and Internet eras , and opening ourselves to a range of ideas .
That does n't mean giving up your beliefs , but simply acknowledging that others—many others—have a different point of view .

The second study featured 243 Americans who were surveyed the week before, and again the week after, the 2016 presidential election. On both occasions, they indicated their level of disillusionment. Their political ideology was measured by the strength of their agreement with statements such as ""Health care should be provided by our government and accessible to all.""

""The results of the election led to increased disillusionment levels among Clinton voters,"" the researchers write, ""which in turn predicted a shift toward a more left-wing political stance."" In contrast, Trump voters did not feel more disillusioned, and their ideological positions remained the same.

The final study featured 234 people recruited online. Half were asked to ""think of a worldwide issue that makes you feel most disillusioned;"" the others were instructed to ponder ""an ordinary event in your life."" All were asked to describe the topic, and the emotions it evokes in them, in detail.

WHAT DEMOLITION DERBY REVEALS ABOUT SMALL-TOWN POLITICS AND THE TRUMP APOCALYPSE: There is no single storyline to demolition derby. Unlike a football game, there is no ground to take, no points to score. There is only mayhem and survival.

They then noted how disillusioned they were feeling, and replied to statements such as ""After (doing this) writing, I am motivated to find more meaning."" Finally, they were asked how likely it was they would engage in future political activities, including those that involve illegal actions.

Not surprisingly, those who wrote about disillusionment felt that emotion more strongly than those who did not. Tellingly, they also ""reported more extreme political activism intentions."" This was true for both liberals and conservatives.

Maher and Igou conclude that ""to halt the slide into cumulative polarization, the underlying causes of mass disillusionment should be addressed."" That won't be easy: It'll require reversing the prejudice-reinforcing media habits we've acquired in the cable news and Internet eras, and opening ourselves to a range of ideas.

That doesn't mean giving up your beliefs, but simply acknowledging that others—many others—have a different point of view. If our cherished assumptions about our fellow citizens are periodically challenged, the events that disprove them might not be such an attitude-hardening shock.",www.psmag.com,left,3l2ri9bTs0LgvKLO

The Democrats are late to the game. During the 2016 election cycle, Republicans expressed their anger routinely and richly. Trump himself cultivated that anger. As Ian Tuttle rightly wrote at National Review in 2015, “Many conservatives are having their Howard Beale moment: They’re mad as hell, and they don’t want to sit down and take it anymore.”

Now, anger is nothing new in politics. Anger has dominated political discourse since the times of the Bible (ask Moses how he felt about a stiff-necked people seemingly ready to throw him overboard every few weeks). And some anger is justified. If you are angry at corruption in Washington, D.C., you have every right to be. If you are angry at a heedless leviathan grasping at your wages, that anger is justified. Even if you channel that emotion in the wrong direction, we can at least understand the anger.

But something new has happened to American politics in the last few years: Politicians have realized that the simplest path to power is to humor everyone’s anger. If you take someone’s anger from them, you’ve emotionally castrated them. More important, you run the risk of driving them into the arms of someone who will feed their anger — an anger that will now turn on you for the sin of having discounted that anger in the first place.

One of the great lies of psychology, dominant since the era of Freud, is that coddling emotions leads to more emotional fulfillment. Actually, coddling emotions leads to emotional unhealthiness. It leads us to wallow in our emotions. Anger feels good — and it feels even better when someone tells you that you’re not wrong to be angry in the first place. If you crave emotional payoff, and if those around you are taught to cosset your emotions, you’re likely to engage more and more often in emotionally overwrought behavior. Bad psychologists indulge their clients’ emotional states. Good psychologists ask whether those emotional states are justified.

As social psychologist Jonathan Haidt (among others) states, cognitive behavioral therapy, a technique used to treat those with emotional disorders, is generally as effective as antidepressants for anxiety and depression. Therapy consists of identifying illogical links in a chain of thought that leads to an emotionally hazardous place. You might figure out, for example, that you’re attributing motives to someone even though you have no evidence about his motives, or that you overgeneralize, or that you’re looking only at the bad things in your life rather than at the good things as well. Once you’ve identified your own faulty thinking, you can stop the emotional runaway train.

Politicians are trained to do the opposite.

Politicians spend their lives seeking the favor of others. That means they find it wildly beneficial to nurse the emotions of constituents — the customer, of course, is always right!

Trump obviously believes his strategy of riling voters up with bigotry is effective . What ’ s striking is the political press agrees with him . “ This pure brute force from Trump could work , ” notes NBC News , “ because there is no equal response from Democrats. ” On Twitter , the New York Times ’ Maggie Haberman asserted similarly that this “ controversial , race-baiting ” rhetoric has been “ effective for him politically. ” And looking at these remarks in the context of the 2016 election , Axios asserts that “ immigration and stoking fear about Mexican immigrants propelled Trump to the White House . ”
But this conventional wisdom—that bigotry wins votes and elections—depends on imprecision around the idea of “ effective. ” The media has taken the fact that Trump became president after making those appeals as evidence they broadly work ; the fact that Republican primary voters endorsed Trump ’ s nativism and xenophobia has somehow become proof that it ’ s a viable election strategy whenever it ’ s deployed . But neither claim—and both are key assumptions made by political analysts in the Trump era—stands to serious scrutiny . And while Trump ’ s anti-immigrant rhetoric undoubtedly resonates with many Republicans , there ’ s no strong indication that it works on its own as an “ effective ” message among Americans writ large .
Republicans beyond Trump have made a similar gambit that racist insinuation will energize their supporters and move voters in their favor . In a predominantly white congressional district in upstate New York , GOP political groups have attacked Democrat Antonio Delgado , who is black , as a “ big city rapper ” who favors “ handouts ” from the government . In Florida , Republican gubernatorial candidate Ron DeSantis has attacked his black opponent , Andrew Gillum , in terms that evoke racist tropes . In California , Republican incumbent Rep. Duncan Hunter has attacked his Arab-American challenger , Ammar Campa-Najjar , as a “ security risk ” with potential ties to “ radical Islam . ”
The proof of concept behind this strategy is Trump ’ s successful election . Trump relied on racism and anti-immigrant sentiment to drive his message , the argument goes , and while it may have produced some defections among college-educated whites , it also attracted enough whites without degrees to win narrow victories in places where they formed a large share of the voting population , including Michigan , Pennsylvania , and Wisconsin .

To voters cross-pressured by cultural conservatism on one end and liberal economic views on the other , Trump promised a synthesis attuned to their identities as blue collar white Americans—they could have both .
It ’ s that synthesis which—along with Clinton ’ s stark unpopularity and extraordinary events like the FBI ’ s intervention—produced Trump ’ s victory . In its absence , Republicans have not fared nearly as well , even as they ’ ve tried to replicate the president ’ s strategy of open and explicit bigotry .
There ’ s concrete evidence of this . In the final weeks of the 2017 Virginia gubernatorial race , Republican Ed Gillespie remade himself as a demagogue by playing on white racial resentment with ads blasting Democrat Ralph Northam for “ sanctuary cities ” and the MS-13 gang .

Despite this controversy , he was favored to win , running in an electorate that hadn ’ t chosen a Democrat for statewide office in more than a decade . But a Democratic surge , and Republican disenchantment , produced a surprise win for Doug Jones , the Democratic nominee .
Most recently , the Republican candidate in the special election for Pennsylvania ’ s 18th Congressional District , Rick Saccone , described himself as “ Trump before Trump was Trump. ” He ran as an acolyte of the president in a district that politically and demographically favored the Republican Party . He lost by a slim margin to Democrat Conor Lamb .
The key difference between Trump and these candidates ? Economic messaging . Trump rejected conservative economic wisdom on retirement spending and other social programs during his presidential campaign , but neither Gillespie nor Moore nor Saccone had an economic agenda distinct from the national Republican Party .

One of the biggest stories of the election cycle is turnout ( as we 've reported a few times now ) : Republican turnout has spiked far beyond 2012 levels , and Democratic turnout has fallen off after the party 's mammoth 2008 .
The tone and the turnout are vastly different between Republicans and Democrats this year , but oddly enough , both sides have something crucial in common : their voters are far less moderate than they were in their last primaries .
Let 's start with the Republican numbers . The below chart shows the ideological difference between the Republican electorate this year and in 2012 . Each dot represents one state — so , for example , 33 percent of Vermont Republican primary voters in 2016 said they considered themselves moderate or liberal , compared to 53 percent in 2012 . That puts Vermont at negative-20 for `` somewhat conservative '' — the most extreme result we found among the 15 GOP states for which there was sufficient exit-poll data .
It 's true exit polls can have a margin of error , but there 's no mistaking a pattern here . In no state did the share of `` moderate '' and `` liberal '' GOP primary voters grow from 2012 to 2016 . ( The exit polls lumped moderate and liberal together in 2012 , so they 're not separated out here . )
Altogether , an NPR analysis finds that the share of `` somewhat conservative '' voters on the GOP side climbed by nearly 10 percentage points in 2016 over 2012 's primaries . ( That is , among the states with exit polling data for both years ) . The share who were moderate or liberal , meanwhile , fell by around 9 percentage points , and the share who were `` very conservative '' held relatively steady .
Something similar is at work on the Democratic side , as well :
The share of moderate and conservative Democratic voters was down — sometimes dramatically so — in most states that have voted thus far . Meanwhile , the share of people who are somewhat or very liberal is way up .
This year , around 60 percent of Democratic primary voters said they considered themselves `` somewhat '' or `` very liberal , '' up from around 45 percent in 2008 ( once again , among states with sufficient exit polling data for both years ) .
So interestingly , though voters on both sides are less moderate than in the last contests , Democrats this year have more decidedly moved toward the `` very liberal '' end of the spectrum . Republican voters , meanwhile , are way more `` somewhat conservative '' than in 2012 , but do n't appear to be more `` very conservative . ''
One thing to keep in mind : Republican turnout across the board is higher this year . That means there are still a few more moderate and liberal Republican primary and caucus voters this cycle than there were in the 2012 primaries — it 's just that the number of somewhat conservative Republicans shot up way more .
Likewise , Democratic turnout is down almost entirely across the board .

One of the biggest stories of the election cycle is turnout (as we've reported a few times now): Republican turnout has spiked far beyond 2012 levels, and Democratic turnout has fallen off after the party's mammoth 2008.

The tone and the turnout are vastly different between Republicans and Democrats this year, but oddly enough, both sides have something crucial in common: their voters are far less moderate than they were in their last primaries.

Let's start with the Republican numbers. The below chart shows the ideological difference between the Republican electorate this year and in 2012. Each dot represents one state — so, for example, 33 percent of Vermont Republican primary voters in 2016 said they considered themselves moderate or liberal, compared to 53 percent in 2012. That puts Vermont at negative-20 for ""somewhat conservative"" — the most extreme result we found among the 15 GOP states for which there was sufficient exit-poll data.

It's true exit polls can have a margin of error, but there's no mistaking a pattern here. In no state did the share of ""moderate"" and ""liberal"" GOP primary voters grow from 2012 to 2016. (The exit polls lumped moderate and liberal together in 2012, so they're not separated out here.)

Altogether, an NPR analysis finds that the share of ""somewhat conservative"" voters on the GOP side climbed by nearly 10 percentage points in 2016 over 2012's primaries. (That is, among the states with exit polling data for both years). The share who were moderate or liberal, meanwhile, fell by around 9 percentage points, and the share who were ""very conservative"" held relatively steady.

Something similar is at work on the Democratic side, as well:

The share of moderate and conservative Democratic voters was down — sometimes dramatically so — in most states that have voted thus far. Meanwhile, the share of people who are somewhat or very liberal is way up.

This year, around 60 percent of Democratic primary voters said they considered themselves ""somewhat"" or ""very liberal,"" up from around 45 percent in 2008 (once again, among states with sufficient exit polling data for both years).

So interestingly, though voters on both sides are less moderate than in the last contests, Democrats this year have more decidedly moved toward the ""very liberal"" end of the spectrum. Republican voters, meanwhile, are way more ""somewhat conservative"" than in 2012, but don't appear to be more ""very conservative.""

So what happened?

One thing to keep in mind: Republican turnout across the board is higher this year. That means there are still a few more moderate and liberal Republican primary and caucus voters this cycle than there were in the 2012 primaries — it's just that the number of somewhat conservative Republicans shot up way more.

Likewise, Democratic turnout is down almost entirely across the board. Interestingly, even with the sharp drop off in turnout, multiplying the exit poll data by the turnout numbers suggests that the raw number of ""very liberal"" Democratic voters is, in fact, up slightly from 2008. However, the number of moderate and conservative voters dropped off steeply. And even though the share of ""somewhat liberal"" voters is up, the raw number is also down.

But anyway: all of this could mean that a bunch of moderate and conservative Democrats who voted in 2008 stayed home this year, while a lot of those somewhat and very liberal Democrats from 2008 came out again. Likewise, it could mean that the Republican wave of turnout is driven largely by a bunch of ""somewhat conservative"" voters who weren't there in 2012.

And looking at the results so far, there are simple explanations to why this might be happening. The very-liberal Bernie Sanders is probably driving some of the turnout among very-liberal voters. It's likewise possible that the somewhat-conservative Trump is behind the bump in somewhat conservative voters in Republican primaries (while Ted Cruz does better among very conservative voters, and John Kasich gets more votes among moderates).

But then, it might not just be candidate-driven: it's possible that lots of people have simply become more conservative or liberal than they were four or eight years ago. This is also to some degree plausible, as there is evidence that Americans are getting more polarized.

In other words, there's a chicken-egg question here, with no clear answer — chances are, they're both right. To the degree that voters are more polarized, they're gravitating toward more extreme candidates. And Sanders and Trump also both happen to be very good at energizing people to turn out and vote for them.",www.npr.org,center,mBHi8DZPilNxasfp

Campaign finance laws exacerbate political polarization



They think of the campaign finance world as being divided into two groups: ""pragmatists"" and ""purists."" The pragmatists primarily want to win elections. Period. The purists are ideologically motivated. They seek to make an impact on policy, sometimes with respect to specific issues.

Both the modern parties are made up these two types, especially when we think of parties as ""extended networks"" that include activists and issue-oriented groups. The Democratic Party, for example, has pragmatists like DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, whose chief job is to help get Democrats elected.

But the party also includes purists, like NARAL Pro-Choice America, which would like to see Democrats elected but only because Democrats are likely to advance their abortion rights policy agenda. Ultimately, the purists care more about their policy than about winning elections. The Republicans have the same setup — think Reince Priebus and the National Rifle Association.

Since the pragmatists care more about winning elections than about enacting policy they have a moderating effect on politics. A pragmatist is more likely to enter coalitions, make compromises, and negotiate to settlements. Purists, on the other hand, are willing to lose elections in the name of their causes. They're less likely to engage in cooperative behavior and to seek to negotiate with the other side to resolve conflicts. In other words, the purists polarize.

Campaign finance laws directly affect the relative balance between pragmatists and purists in the parties. While there is considerable variance across the states, most campaign finance laws restrict the behavior of, and contributions to, the formal party organizations.

Ultimately, then, we've created systems of campaign finance that constrain the moderates — those who have incentives to compromise — while we've left the purists completely unregulated. Candidates, then, have incentives to court these purists because that's where the money is. This creates incentives for increasingly ideologically extreme candidates to pursue, and win, office.

It might be difficult to convince America that parties are good, but that's exactly the case. To all those Americans out there screaming for some mechanism that will help them to gain political power, represent their interests, and take government head on, we already have such organizations — they're called parties. Parties, as the research shows, are a moderating force in politics, when the formal parts of them are strong and empowered.

Political parties are a moderating force in politics



If America and political parties had a Facebook relationship status, it would be, ""It's complicated."" Parties serve an important and useful role in our politics, but they can be beguilingly frustrating and are prone to corruption. Compromise is good when you want decisions to get made, but it's terrible when it means that your side gave up something that you wanted. A century ago, in many major American cities the political parties and local governments were so enmeshed they were indistinguishable from one another.

When formal parties are hampered, candidates seek funding from organizations and individuals who have no incentive to compromise.

The evidence is compelling: Donors are polarized. Candidates attract more money by holding more extreme views. Parties tend to support ideologically moderate candidates.

Candidates rely on non-party money. Parties prefer to support moderates, but their efforts are now dwarfed by the purists. (See the above referenced book for the graphs and tables that display this evidence.)

Congratulations, America. You've done an excellent job of creating a relative non-corrupt system. Really. It's true. Stories about quid pro quos, vote buying, or direct conflicts of interests between the governed and the governing are fewer now than they ever have been. The price we've paid for this non-corruption is the gridlock, stubborn, my-way-or-the-highway politics we've all come to detest.

We probably can't (de)regulate ourselves out of the current dysfunction that is our polarized politics, but we could alleviate some of it. Campaign finance laws that strengthen the formal parties would take some of the money out of the hands of extremists by attracting away donors who may prefer to give to a party rather than a candidate or cause. Parties seek to win office, and they make compromises to get there. This moderates our politics.

Since you and I aren't in control of regulations, is there anything we can do to alleviate this problem? Indeed. Giving money directly to candidates exacerbates polarization by encouraging candidates to hold extreme views. The donor pool is polarized, and candidates will go where the money is. However, when parties are flush with funds, candidates have incentives to moderate to get access to their vast chests.

If you want to make a meaningful New Year's resolution that will help the country and not just you, then vow only to donate to the formal parties and not give a single dime this election season to individual candidates. At the national level for Democrats that would be these: DNC, DCCC, DSCC, and for Republicans, these: RNC, RNCC, NRSC.

Conway decided to answer this question by claiming that Dr. King would have hated impeachment : “ The president … agrees with many of the things that Dr. Martin Luther King stood for and agreed with for many years , including unity and equality , ” she said . “ He ’ s not the one trying to tear the country apart through an impeachment process and a lack of substance that really is very shameful at this point . ”
If this claim—that really it ’ s the impeachment process that ’ s tearing this nation apart—sounds familiar , it ’ s because it was also the lament of GOP House members as impeachment unfolded there . Yes , the day before the president ’ s impeachment trial opens in the Senate , and on the selfsame day Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell introduced rules that will , he hopes , preclude the calling of witnesses , hearing of evidence , and any other indicia of a “ trial ” in the Senate trial , the GOP has fallen perfectly in line behind the “ stop tearing the country apart ” argument as its impeachment defense . It ’ s the new authoritarian ’ s lament .
“ This is a sad day for America , ” intoned Ohio Rep. Bill Johnson , as the House debated the articles of impeachment in December , before calling for a moment of silence to memorialize the 63 million Americans who voted for Trump . As Michelle Goldberg noted at the time , “ On the surface it seems strange , this constant trumpeting of a vote total that is more than two million less than the total received by Trump ’ s opponent , Hillary Clinton . Trump didn ’ t just lose the popular vote—he lost it by a greater margin than any successful presidential candidate in American history . … But as I watched impeachment unfold , it seemed like something more than that—an assertion of whom Republicans think this country belongs to. ” The Republican howls about an unruly minority of socialists and protesters who seek the removal of this president misconstrue the fact that a majority of Americans do not agree to be governed by diktat . A new CNN poll shows that 51 percent of Americans want Trump removed from office , 74 percent of them are closely watching impeachment coverage , and 69 percent want to hear witness testimony . In other words , the majority of America does not consent to authoritarian Senate procedures and rules , and it is not some small faction of illiberal Democrats who are tearing the country apart , as Conway suggests . The majority of Americans are not willing to submit to autocracy , though we will turn to the Senate Tuesday to see if the majority of Americans ’ wishes are to be trammeled by Senate Republicans . Spoiler alert : It seems all but inevitable that they will be , which tells you a good deal about how the Senate represents American voters .
The Republican howls about an unruly minority of socialists and protesters who seek the removal of this president misconstrue the fact that a majority of Americans do not agree to be governed by diktat .
If you would like to see another example of what minority rule feels like , kindly turn your attention to the 22,000 people who showed up in Richmond , Virginia , for what is now being described in the media as a “ peaceful ” march and a triumph of peaceable assembly . Armed with assault-style weapons and body armor , militia members were seen wearing masks and carrying semi-automatic rifles outside the seat of government . The biggest star of the rally—identified by the Washington Post as Brandon Lewis—brandished his .50-caliber Barrett M82A1 rifle , as passersby expressed admiration . “ This sends a strong visual message , ” Lewis , cradling the firearm and decked out in a helmet and bulletproof vest , told the Post . “ The government is not above us . They are us. ” The Washington Post clocked another protester wearing full-body camo , with a bulletproof vest , a handgun and an AR-15–style assault rifle . The protesters were overwhelmingly white and overwhelmingly male and overwhelmingly dedicated to a vision of “ peace ” that looks like this . They were there to refuse to abide by any democratically passed gun control measures , and they stood outside the state capitol chanting First Amendment–protected threats to oust Virginia ’ s democratically elected governor . More than 100 counties , cities , and towns in Virginia have declared themselves Second Amendment sanctuaries and vowed to oppose any new “ unconstitutional restrictions ” on guns , presumably following the lead of one of Monday ’ s speakers , a county sheriff who last month promised to “ deputize ” gun owners if lawmakers continue to push gun control measures . This nullification will be attempted despite the fact that the great majority of Virginia voters actually favor Democratic proposals to limit gun access , a Washington Post–Schar School poll found in October .
Todd Gilbert , the Republican Leader of the Virginia House of Delegates , issued a statement on Jan. 10 after the decision was taken to declare a temporary state of emergency , banning all weapons from the Capitol grounds from Friday at 5 p.m. until Tuesday at 5 p.m. Gilbert ’ s statement deplored that action as “ disgusting and wrong. ” The same Todd Gilbert reversed himself on Sunday , issuing a statement opposing protesters who would spread “ white supremacist garbage , ” hate , civil unrest , or violence , after multiple white supremacists and Nazis were arrested and it became clear that there was at least a possibility of violence at the march . The threat of violence is only as serious as your most recent FBI briefing , it seems . That doesn ’ t make for a peaceful demonstration—it puts you at the mercy of the armed marchers .
But because there was no violence in the end , we are told , the rally was “ peaceful. ” As Jim Geraghty at National Review noted smugly , the threatened violence never occurred , which means that the media panic ( and apparently that of Todd Gilbert ) was overblown . The march was apparently peaceful , he writes , because “ perhaps the hateful types decided to stay away . ”
Perhaps there were violent people who decided to stay away from Richmond on Monday . But there were also nonviolent people who decided they needed to stay away from Richmond on Monday . As Garrett Epps notes , those who stayed away included many other groups who had equally compelling First Amendment statements to offer :
The Coalition to Stop Gun Violence had also planned to assemble and petition for gun-control legislation—as it had done in peaceful competition with gun-rights groups in previous years . This year , because of the threats of armed violence surrounding the gun-rights march , that gun-control demonstration had to be canceled . The delegate from Manassas , Lee Carter , the South ’ s only socialist legislator , went into hiding because of death threats . Carter had not , in fact , sponsored an anti-gun measure , but gun-rights groups spread disinformation on the internet that he had done so ; his life—and his ability to function as a legislator—was endangered .
Pages from the Legislature ’ s page program were told to stay home . Many legislators asked their staffs to stay away or work from home . The rally forced officials to reschedule the city ’ s Martin Luther King Jr. Day vigil for the first time in 28 years .

On Monday, Kellyanne Conway responded to a reporter’s question about why the president’s public schedule of events included no function to commemorate Martin Luther King Jr., on a holiday designated to honor him. Conway decided to answer this question by claiming that Dr. King would have hated impeachment: “The president … agrees with many of the things that Dr. Martin Luther King stood for and agreed with for many years, including unity and equality,” she said. “He’s not the one trying to tear the country apart through an impeachment process and a lack of substance that really is very shameful at this point.”

If this claim—that really it’s the impeachment process that’s tearing this nation apart—sounds familiar, it’s because it was also the lament of GOP House members as impeachment unfolded there. Yes, the day before the president’s impeachment trial opens in the Senate, and on the selfsame day Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell introduced rules that will, he hopes, preclude the calling of witnesses, hearing of evidence, and any other indicia of a “trial” in the Senate trial, the GOP has fallen perfectly in line behind the “stop tearing the country apart” argument as its impeachment defense. It’s the new authoritarian’s lament.

“This is a sad day for America,” intoned Ohio Rep. Bill Johnson, as the House debated the articles of impeachment in December, before calling for a moment of silence to memorialize the 63 million Americans who voted for Trump. As Michelle Goldberg noted at the time, “On the surface it seems strange, this constant trumpeting of a vote total that is more than two million less than the total received by Trump’s opponent, Hillary Clinton. Trump didn’t just lose the popular vote—he lost it by a greater margin than any successful presidential candidate in American history. … But as I watched impeachment unfold, it seemed like something more than that—an assertion of whom Republicans think this country belongs to.” The Republican howls about an unruly minority of socialists and protesters who seek the removal of this president misconstrue the fact that a majority of Americans do not agree to be governed by diktat. A new CNN poll shows that 51 percent of Americans want Trump removed from office, 74 percent of them are closely watching impeachment coverage, and 69 percent want to hear witness testimony. In other words, the majority of America does not consent to authoritarian Senate procedures and rules, and it is not some small faction of illiberal Democrats who are tearing the country apart, as Conway suggests. The majority of Americans are not willing to submit to autocracy, though we will turn to the Senate Tuesday to see if the majority of Americans’ wishes are to be trammeled by Senate Republicans. Spoiler alert: It seems all but inevitable that they will be, which tells you a good deal about how the Senate represents American voters.

The Republican howls about an unruly minority of socialists and protesters who seek the removal of this president misconstrue the fact that a majority of Americans do not agree to be governed by diktat.

If you would like to see another example of what minority rule feels like, kindly turn your attention to the 22,000 people who showed up in Richmond, Virginia, for what is now being described in the media as a “peaceful” march and a triumph of peaceable assembly. Armed with assault-style weapons and body armor, militia members were seen wearing masks and carrying semi-automatic rifles outside the seat of government. The biggest star of the rally—identified by the Washington Post as Brandon Lewis—brandished his .50-caliber Barrett M82A1 rifle, as passersby expressed admiration. “This sends a strong visual message,” Lewis, cradling the firearm and decked out in a helmet and bulletproof vest, told the Post. “The government is not above us. They are us.” The Washington Post clocked another protester wearing full-body camo, with a bulletproof vest, a handgun and an AR-15–style assault rifle. The protesters were overwhelmingly white and overwhelmingly male and overwhelmingly dedicated to a vision of “peace” that looks like this. They were there to refuse to abide by any democratically passed gun control measures, and they stood outside the state capitol chanting First Amendment–protected threats to oust Virginia’s democratically elected governor. More than 100 counties, cities, and towns in Virginia have declared themselves Second Amendment sanctuaries and vowed to oppose any new “unconstitutional restrictions” on guns, presumably following the lead of one of Monday’s speakers, a county sheriff who last month promised to “deputize” gun owners if lawmakers continue to push gun control measures. This nullification will be attempted despite the fact that the great majority of Virginia voters actually favor Democratic proposals to limit gun access, a Washington Post–Schar School poll found in October.

Todd Gilbert, the Republican Leader of the Virginia House of Delegates, issued a statement on Jan. 10 after the decision was taken to declare a temporary state of emergency, banning all weapons from the Capitol grounds from Friday at 5 p.m. until Tuesday at 5 p.m. Gilbert’s statement deplored that action as “disgusting and wrong.” The same Todd Gilbert reversed himself on Sunday, issuing a statement opposing protesters who would spread “white supremacist garbage,” hate, civil unrest, or violence, after multiple white supremacists and Nazis were arrested and it became clear that there was at least a possibility of violence at the march. The threat of violence is only as serious as your most recent FBI briefing, it seems. That doesn’t make for a peaceful demonstration—it puts you at the mercy of the armed marchers.

But because there was no violence in the end, we are told, the rally was “peaceful.” As Jim Geraghty at National Review noted smugly, the threatened violence never occurred, which means that the media panic (and apparently that of Todd Gilbert) was overblown. The march was apparently peaceful, he writes, because “perhaps the hateful types decided to stay away.”

Perhaps there were violent people who decided to stay away from Richmond on Monday. But there were also nonviolent people who decided they needed to stay away from Richmond on Monday. As Garrett Epps notes, those who stayed away included many other groups who had equally compelling First Amendment statements to offer:

The Coalition to Stop Gun Violence had also planned to assemble and petition for gun-control legislation—as it had done in peaceful competition with gun-rights groups in previous years. This year, because of the threats of armed violence surrounding the gun-rights march, that gun-control demonstration had to be canceled. The delegate from Manassas, Lee Carter, the South’s only socialist legislator, went into hiding because of death threats. Carter had not, in fact, sponsored an anti-gun measure, but gun-rights groups spread disinformation on the internet that he had done so; his life—and his ability to function as a legislator—was endangered.

Pages from the Legislature’s page program were told to stay home. Many legislators asked their staffs to stay away or work from home. The rally forced officials to reschedule the city’s Martin Luther King Jr. Day vigil for the first time in 28 years. New Virginia Majority—one of the largest progressive groups in the commonwealth—postponed its annual MLK Day of Action due to threats from armed racist groups and because “we cannot protect our people from individuals committed to acts of violence.” Mothers Demand Action stayed off the streets and held phone-banking events, and it almost goes without saying that virtually all people of color stayed home. And so a “peaceful” march, as fêted in the media and fêted by those who seek to blur the line between First Amendment speech and Second Amendment threats, will now include in its definition mass marches in which participants are armed with assault weapons, many of whom were also wearing masks. (Only one person in a mask was arrested Monday despite the fact that hundreds were masked. She was unarmed.)

The fact that nobody was harmed or worse, as occurred in Charlottesville, is likely because those who would have come to the capital to support the gun measures largely stayed home, out of fear. As Epps concluded correctly, “One group’s politics canceled those of others.” This was not a free and open exchange of ideas. It was a display of lethal military power—power restrained so long as nobody provoked it. Only one side believes that marching through city streets brandishing weapons of war is peaceful. And not only did these marchers win the public square this week—they also won the media narrative that such marches are peaceable First Amendment displays. But they are only peaceful displays so long as those who might oppose the guns rights marchers or white supremacists or Nazis stay home. Just as money counts as First Amendment free speech because it can swallow other speech, so too are guns, because they can terrorize other speech.

The minority who carried guns in Richmond overran the majority because of their lethal power. The minority that controls the Senate in D.C. seeks to overrun the majority because of electoral power. This is not liberal democracy at work. It is authoritarianism calling itself the will of the majority, but effectuated by minority power alone.",www.slate.com,left,apdeWFy7V2LUEd2J

When Facebook entered the news business in 2006 , it set out to cover its own users . Facebook had launched as a static collection of profiles , but now , every time a user uploaded a new photo or changed her favorite quote , the development surfaced in a rolling stream of updates that Facebook called the “ News Feed. ” Every status update was a “ news story ” ; the algorithm that chose which stories to boost was called “ the publisher. ” The publisher , Facebook told its users at the time , was interested in stories like “ Mark adds Britney Spears to his Favorites ” and “ your crush is single again. ” As David Kirkpatrick reported in his 2010 book The Facebook Effect , Mark Zuckerberg articulated the News Feed ’ s guiding principle to staff like so : “ A squirrel dying in front of your house may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying in Africa. ” The New York Times would cover the African conflict . The News Feed would show you the squirrel .
Now Facebook is poised to begin publishing New York Times stories directly to its own site . Last year the Pew Research Center deemed Facebook the second-most popular source for political and government news among American Internet users , just behind local TV . Facebook has officially entered the news-news business . What kinds of stories does its publisher value now ?
A new study published online in Science last week sheds some light . Three researchers , all Facebook employees , culled data from 10 million Facebook users , 7 million news articles shared on the site , and the users ’ combined 3.8 billion “ potential exposures ” to that content in order to find out how “ ideologically diverse news and opinion ” spreads ( or doesn ’ t ) among liberal and conservative users . They found that the News Feed algorithm—which has long been accused of shielding users from politically oppositional content—decreased the visibility of ideologically “ cross-cutting ” news by 8 percent for liberals and 5 percent for conservatives . From there , liberals were 6 percent less likely to click on a story from a conservative source ( like Fox News ) , while conservatives were 17 percent less likely to click over to a left-leaning site ( like the Huffington Post ) . The Facebook researchers concluded that “ [ i ] ndividual choice has a larger role in limiting exposure to ideologically cross cutting content ” than Facebook ’ s engineers do . All in all , users are “ exposed to more cross-cutting discourse in social media ” than we had all thought .
The study is a clever bit of misdirection . I don ’ t doubt its results—getting your news from Facebook isn ’ t as ideologically isolating as , say , watching Fox News or MSNBC . But its title , “ Exposure to ideologically diverse news and opinion on Facebook , ” makes Facebook sound like a pulsing marketplace of political opinion and news . Meanwhile , I ’ m scrolling down my News Feed and finding videos of Tina Fey faux-stripping and an orangutan cuddling an armful of tiger cubs . Facebook may help nudge liberals a little to the left and conservatives a little to the right , but its greatest influence over Americans is toward political disengagement .
The “ liberals ” and “ conservatives ” tracked in the Facebook study actually represent a slim slice of the site ’ s users . The study included only people who proudly complete the “ political views ” section of their profile , and just 4 percent of adult Americans on Facebook fit the bill . That ’ s a curious group to focus on , because the generation that ’ s most active on Facebook is also the least likely to identify with a political orientation . Last year ’ s Pew report on the beliefs and behaviors of millennials—81 percent of whom are on Facebook—found that a full 50 percent of millennials consider themselves politically independent . Their political “ disaffiliation ” rivals or exceeds that of any group Pew has ever studied in its 25-year existence . Instead , millennials “ are building their own networks , ” Pew concluded—not “ through political parties , organized religion or marriage ” but “ through social media. ” Facebook isn ’ t just facilitating communication between members of different political parties . It is replacing political parties .
Millennials , the New America Foundation found last year , are less likely to vote or pledge allegiance to a party , but they do engage in some “ civic uses of social media. ” ( ███ has a publishing partnership with the New America Foundation . ) Here ’ s one sad data point supporting that conclusion : Forty-four percent of millennials have “ liked ” a piece of political material on social media . Meanwhile , a study published last year in New Media & Society found that being active on Facebook does not encourage teenagers to become more politically engaged . It doesn ’ t inspire them to join protests or sign petitions or affix buttons or even post political thoughts on the Internet . But it does inspire them to spend more time entertaining themselves—chatting with friends , downloading songs , shopping online , and engaging in other “ consumerist-oriented ” activities . This is a convenient outcome for Facebook . It ’ s easy to see why Facebook would prefer young people to see Facebook as a shopping mall rather than a soapbox . These users are easier to monetize and less likely to offend .
After Eli Pariser , Upworthy CEO and the author of The Filter Bubble : What the Internet Is Hiding From You , parsed the Facebook study , he admitted that the algorithm ’ s contribution to the partisan divide was “ smaller than I ’ d have guessed. ” But he also noted that the study elided a more basic question : How does Facebook ’ s algorithm manipulate the spread of news in general ? One of the more revelatory data points embedded in the study concerns the proportion of “ hard content ” ( stories about stuff like campaigns , war , health care , and abortion ) and “ soft content ” ( links about sports , entertainment , food , gadgets , and fashion ) shared on the site . After assessing millions of links , the researchers declared over 90 percent of them soft . Really soft : Examples include a Blind Melon video , a Cyber Monday sale , and a link to a collection of inspirational photos paired with motivational quotes . And the study assessed only the content that links off of Facebook . Consider all the engagement announcements and pet photos that dominate your News Feed , and Facebook ’ s journalistic priorities appear even fluffier .
In theory , Facebook presents an unprecedented opportunity for political cross-pollination . In a 2012 study on polarization and social media , Stanford researchers cited studies dating back to 1967 showing that “ people do not encounter attitude-challenging information in large part due to their social milieu , habits , and lack of perceived benefits for seeking out such information. ” But on Facebook , users connect with friends , past friends , extended family members , co-workers , neighbors , and strangers , many of whom are likely to hold political beliefs that differ from their own . Just don ’ t expect them to talk about it on Facebook . Last year Pew studied how Americans discussed Edward Snowden ’ s leaking of NSA documents and found that while 86 percent of Americans would share their opinion among friends over dinner , only 42 percent of social media users were willing to post about it online . Americans were “ more willing to share their views if they thought their audience agreed with them. ” And the silence followed Facebook users even after they logged off : Facebookers were 50 percent less likely to discuss Snowden in person than nonusers were .
So instead of sparking political debates , Facebook users convene over the soft stuff . The Facebook researchers found that while pieces of hard news tend to circulate in ideological silos , soft content percolates across the aisle . I may scroll past one liberal friend ’ s links expressing unconditional allegiance to Hillary Clinton , but I ’ ll stop and like her video of a Great Dane puppy throwing a temper tantrum . This makes Facebook a powerful force for human connection , but a poor destination for political engagement . The Facebook Effect ’ s Kirkpatrick put a rosier spin on the situation : Now that we include Facebook on our list of legitimate news sources , he said , journalists can boast that young people are reading more news than ever before .

Although Pinker and Haidt are both self-identified liberals themselves, they also recognise that politically homogeneous bubbles do little but spread dogma. If two Twitters were to emerge, one conservative and one left-wing, that would be the result.

Conservatives and cultural libertarians are the most likely constituency to rise up, as they are the ones being predominantly targeted, but this is really a battle that should be taken up by all social media users. The Twitters and Facebooks of the world are not like the media empires of old; they are entirely reliant on users. Properly organised, users could hold them to account, in a way that would make investors sit up and listen — but they are not yet properly organised.

They should be organised, and they should be organised soon. Nothing less than the original dream of the open web, where information flows freely, unfiltered by establishment elites, is at stake. If a new class of domineering media barons is allowed to emerge, “new” media will soon look very much like the old.

Prime Minister Theresa May has accused Russia of ""planting fake stories"" online as part of a ""campaign of cyber-espionage and disruption"".

Her comments come after prominent social media accounts were exposed as Russian bots.

At the start of November, the US Senate Select Committee on Intelligence provided a list of 2,753 suspended, Russian-linked Twitter accounts.

But who is behind these bots and how do they operate?

Many bot accounts have been traced to the Internet Research Agency, in St Petersburg. The Russian government-backed agency reportedly runs social media accounts disseminating ""disinformation"".

This ""troll farm"" was exposed by a whistleblower in the New York Times in 2015. A BBC investigation has also uncovered a pro-Russia ""troll factory"" in Ukraine.

The Oxford Internet Institute - part of the University of Oxford and recipients of the Democracy award for its analysis of propaganda - says bots ""significantly impact [on]public life during important policy debates, elections, and political crises"" and ""flourished during the 2016 US presidential election"".

Catherine Rampell worries that Lake Wobegon-ness is wrecking America:

To an almost comical degree, Americans consistently evaluated their own personal lives and relationships as higher-quality than those of Americans writ large. When married respondents were asked whether they believed their own marriage had gotten better or worse over the previous two years, 43 percent said stronger, 49 percent said about the same and only 6 percent said weaker. But when those same people were asked about U.S. marriages generally, the responses flipped: Just 5 percent said they generally were getting stronger, 40 percent said about the same and 43 percent said weaker.

We see this all over the place, of course. Schools are terrible, but my local school is pretty good. Congress is hopelessly corrupt, but my representative is great. Rampell, however, thinks this is a widespread phenomenon, and it’s responsible for the dysfunction of our political system:

In a country that has become not just polarized, but also atomized; in which we root unwaveringly for our own political “teams” composed of those who look, think, vote and raise children exactly as we do; and in which we treat opposing viewpoints as motivated by malice or stupidity rather than honest disagreement, perhaps it is not so surprising that so many Americans have come down with a serious case of dictator envy, a longing for a political strongman (such as, say, Donald Trump) who will put our neighbors in their place and skirt the pluralistic niceties and nonsense of democracy.

I guess it was inevitable that this piece would somehow end with Donald Trump, since he’s the ultimate mystery to my tribe of hypereducated lefties. Still, Rampell’s point stands without him: if America’s two major tribes think the other tribe is not merely wrong, but dangerous and morally degenerate, democracy gets a lot harder. After all, the underlying prerequisite of democracy isn’t elections, it’s the peaceful transfer of power. But that only happens if both sides consider the other fundamentally legitimate and neither side fears destruction when the other side governs. If you think that Republicans are trying to enslave women’s bodies or that Democrats are secretly in league with Islamic jihadists, that peaceful transfer of power gets harder and harder.

We’re nowhere near to losing it, and the political polarization we feel today isn’t unique in American history. Unfortunately, modern media, both traditional and social, amplifies this polarization. If you watch Fox and MSNBC, you’d barely recognize that they were reporting about the same country. I come across this frequently myself when I hear about some new conservative complaint and find myself completely befuddled. What is that all about? A bit of googling usually provides an answer, and by the time it hits the blog it sounds like I’ve known about it all along. But often I haven’t. It’s been reported widely in B-list conservative outlets, but I’m pretty oblivious to those. Conservatives, however, have been getting increasingly riled up about it for months or years.

I’m perhaps not as worried about this as Rampell. Still, it’s disconcerting to know that there are so many people in both tribes who socialize solely within their own tribe and basically think of those outside it as either laughable or dangerous.

Taken to its extreme , the Filter Bubble might almost completely close users off to new ideas and information , leaving them in a digital world where their viewpoints go ever unchallenged — and contributing to political polarization .
“ Facebook Use Polarizing ? Site Begs to Differ , ” the New York Times headline read . “ You would think that if there was an echo chamber , you would not be exposed to any conflicting information , ” a data scientist who worked on the study said , “ but that ’ s not the case here . ”
But looking at the study , I came to very different conclusions . It absolutely shows that the “ filter bubble ” exists among some users , and that Facebook and its algorithms play a significant role in creating that bubble . But I can only make that claim about a small number of users that are likely not at all representative of the broader Facebook population , because Facebook relied on such an unusual sample of its users . In other words , despite the buzz this study is getting , we still don ’ t have a very good sense of how Facebook and other social-media services might or might not contribute to polarization .
As pointed out by Nathan Jurgenson , the study only looks at people who self-identify their political orientation on the site . That means it only examines 9 percent of users , a number you ’ d only see if you read through the appendix , he notes . It also only looks at Facebook users who log in four to seven days a week , and who meet a few other criteria as well . That nudges the proportion of users examined in the study down to just 4 percent , or about 10 million users .
Are those 4 percent of users representative of Facebook ’ s user base as a whole ? Well , they aren ’ t randomly sampled . We know that identifying your political affiliation is a fairly rare behavior , given that fewer than one in ten users bothers to do so . My guess is that those users are much more politically engaged and likely much more partisan than the average user , and that ’ s probably going to affect what they click on and whom they are friends with . But how and how much that matters , I can not say .
There could also be something different about those Facebook users who log in frequently — maybe they post more or leave more comments . Again , we don ’ t know . But the point is that if you want to make any broad conclusions about a big population based on a study , you need a random , representative sample . You can ’ t survey three rich guys in Greenwich and declare that “ America ’ s ” favorite food is caviar .
Social-media experts and data scientists are taking Facebook to task for not making all this clearer . “ At first , I read this quickly and I took this to mean that out of the at least 200 million Americans who have used Facebook , the researchers selected a ‘ large ’ sample that was representative of Facebook users , ” writes Christian Sandvig of the University of Michigan . “ The ‘ limitations ’ section discusses the demographics of ‘ Facebook ’ s users , ’ as would be the normal thing to do if they were sampled . There is no information about the selection procedure in the article itself . ”
But even setting aside the sample issues , the study clearly does not show that those unusual users are exposed to a diverse set of viewpoints , nudged along by the Facebook algorithm . It shows that they see a fairly skewed set of viewpoints , with the Facebook algorithm contributing to the skew . Facebook filters out about 1 in 20 “ cross-cutting ” hard-news stories for conservatives and about 1 in 13 “ cross-cutting ” hard-news stories for liberals .
Facebook attempts to distance itself from filter-bubble accusations by noting that individuals isolate themselves , too , with self-identified conservatives clicking on 17 percent fewer “ cross-cutting ” news stories than would be expected if they clicked at random , and liberals , 6 percent fewer . The company used that finding to argue that it plays less of a role than individuals themselves . But that ’ s only true for conservatives — not for liberals .
And it ’ s not clear that Facebook can or should be arguing that it plays a smaller filtering role than individuals , given how the study was conducted in the first place and given that the two findings do not seem directly comparable . “ I can not remember a worse apples to oranges comparison I ’ ve seen recently , especially since these two dynamics , algorithmic suppression and individual choice , have cumulative effects , ” writes Zeynep Tufekci of the University of North Carolina .
No , the filter bubble feels like a very real phenomenon , and Facebook has just shown that for some users , it contributes to it . On social media , we hear what we want to hear , see what we want to see , and click what we want to click .

polarization,Grist,0,http://grist.org/politics/obama-finally-understands-political-polarization-does-hillary/,Obama finally understands political polarization. Does Hillary?,2015-03-17,David Roberts,"I missed Jonathan Chait ’ s “ exit interview ” with Dan Pfeiffer , a close Obama aide since the 2008 presidential campaign , while I was out last week snowboarding and ignoring the news . It ’ s fascinating ! In it , Pfeiffer discusses some of the lessons the Obama crew has learned over the last six years .
I ( and many others ) have written many times about the decades-long trend toward deeper political polarization in the U.S. — see here , here , and here . I ( and many others ) have expressed frustration with the Obama administration ’ s persistent and futile efforts to compromise on policy goals in search of Republican cooperation . Obama came into office desperate to make good on his 2004 promise that “ there is no Red America and Blue America , ” and it led to concessions and omissions that have angered progressives and paid no political dividends .
Lately , however , the Obama crew has appeared more clueful . Particularly since the 2014 midterms , the administration has acted aggressively and unilaterally in support of its goals , disregarding and often mocking continued GOP intransigence . This has led to substantial policy progress and greater support for Obama from his own base and the public more broadly .
Pfeiffer cites three structural forces that Obama and his team initially underestimated . From Chait ’ s piece :
The first is rising polarization — “ the great sorting , ” as [ Pfeiffer ] called it — which , over a period of decades , has driven white conservatives out of the Democratic Party and moderates out of the Republican Party , creating two ideologically homogeneous political organizations . The second is the disintegration of restrictions on campaign finance , which “ gives people even more incentive to play to the far right or to a set of special-interests donors , so that one individual can basically , especially in these House races , do a $ 1 million expenditure and completely tip the balance. ” And , finally , the news media has changed so that people select only sources that will confirm their preexisting beliefs .
Combined , these trends have made communicating with Republicans impossible for Obama . Their epistemic closure is too complete and the short-term political incentives all lie in pandering to their ethno-nationalist base .
What ’ s more , the old mental model that lots of journalists and politicos have in their heads — an extreme Republican base topped by a layer of “ responsible Republicans ” who tone them down and keep them under control — is no longer accurate . The tail is wagging the dog , the “ responsible ” leaders tap dancing to the base ’ s tune . There is no one in charge .
The administration has now decided that in many cases , even adversarial bargaining fails because the Republican leadership is not capable of planning tactically . “ You have to be careful not to presume a lot of strategy for this group , ” Pfeiffer said . “ I ’ ve always believed that the fundamental , driving strategic ethos of the Republican House leadership has been , What do we do to get through the next caucus or conference without getting yelled at ? We should never assume they have a long game . We used to spend a lot of time thinking that maybe [ Republican House Speaker John ] Boehner is saying this to get himself some more room . And it ’ s like , no , that ’ s not actually the case . Usually he ’ s just saying it because he just said it or it ’ s the easiest thing to solve his immediate problem . ”
Boehner ’ s primary concern is preventing the conservative base from having his head mounted on a pike . That ’ s what guides his day-to-day decision-making , such as it is . And that is true of most Republican officeholders , especially in the House , where representatives increasingly rise to power in dark red districts where they have no need or incentive to speak to anyone beyond the base . In short , there is no plan , no method to the madness .
These larger forces swamp the effects of daily , news-cycle-based political maneuvering .
The original premise of Obama ’ s first presidential campaign was that he could reason with Republicans — or else , by staking out obviously reasonable stances , force them to moderate or be exposed as extreme and unyielding . It took years for the White House to conclude that this was false , and that , in Pfeiffer ’ s words , “ What drives 90 percent of stuff is not the small tactical decisions or the personal relationships but the big , macro-political incentives . ”
Right . Another way of saying this is that most of what political pundits focus on day-to-day is meaningless . Obama can ’ t get Republican cooperation by calling Boehner on the phone more often , or playing golf with him , or socializing more with Congress , or moderating his rhetoric , or making small-bore policy concessions . “ Leadership ” can not magically overcome powerful political incentives .
This analysis puts the administration at odds with the reading of American politics that still dominates much of Washington reporting . Many political journalists imagine that the basic tension for the White House lies between Obama ’ s liberal base and appealing to Americans at the center , who will be crucial for tipping elections . Pfeiffer believes the dynamic is , in fact , the opposite : “ The incentive structure moves from going after the diminishing middle to motivating the base. ” Ever since Republicans took control of the House four years ago , attempts to court Republicans have mostly failed while simultaneously dividing Democratic voters . Obama ’ s most politically successful maneuvers , by contrast , have all been unilateral and liberal . “ Whenever we contemplate bold progressive action , ” Pfeiffer said , “ whether that ’ s the president ’ s endorsement of marriage equality , or coming out strong on power-plant rules to reduce current pollution , on immigration , on net neutrality , you get a lot of hemming and hawing in advance about what this is going to mean : Is this going to alienate people ? Is this going to hurt the president ’ s approval ratings ? What will this mean in red states ? ” And yet , this hesitation has always proved overblown : “ There ’ s never been a time when we ’ ve taken progressive action and regretted it. ” This was deeply at odds with the lesson Bill Clinton and most of his aides ( many of whom staffed Obama ’ s administration ) had taken away from his presidency . But by the beginning of Obama ’ s second term , at least , the president seemed fully convinced . “ As we were preparing for the potential that we would lose the midterms , ” Pfeiffer told me , “ a lot of the advice we got around town was : You have to show major contrition ; heads have to roll ; you have to give some sop to the Republicans . The president ’ s view was : No , we ’ re not going to do that . We ’ re going to go out and we ’ re going to be the opposite of contrite ; we ’ re going to be aggressive in our policies and our politics . And that worked . It caused people to cheer . But that ’ s the exact opposite of the sort of advice you ’ d get in this town. ” [ my emphasis ]
This is a really big deal . It ’ s hard to overstate the strength and depth of the Washington conventional wisdom : Dems should apologize for their base , tack to the center , moderate their rhetoric , and seek compromise . That CW , decades in the making , is so deeply embedded in the heads of most older journalists and politicos that it is all but impossible to dislodge , no matter how much the evidence stacks up against it .
But if Pfeiffer is right , the dam may finally be breaking . Obama ’ s administration has been such a searingly clear demonstration of polarization that even aides shaped by the Clinton years ( when triangulation was all the rage ) have been unable to avoid its implications .
The big question , in my mind , is whether this revelation extends beyond the White House to the Democratic Party in general , most particularly to one Hillary Rodham Clinton . She recently said that she wants to transcend red and blue and reach “ a nice warm purple space where we ’ re trying to solve problems . ”
This is the very quintessence of outdated CW . It presumes a shared pool of problems that the parties are competing to solve . But the parties do not agree on what constitutes a problem . The GOP doesn ’ t think climate change is a problem — or income inequality , or the lack of worker bargaining power , or the over-militarization of foreign policy , or racism in policing . What ’ s at issue in American politics is not technocratic differences over means , but philosophical differences over ends . There is a Red America and a Blue America and they have different values and different visions for the country . The warm purple space is draining and close to empty .
Maybe Clinton thinks she has to say stuff like this . It still resonates with low-information voters ( including , for example , the Washington Post editorial page ) . And it was a big part of Obama ’ s appeal in 2008 . Perhaps it ’ s a ritual that all new presidential candidates must act out for the benefit of an electorate exhausted by the conflicts of the passing administration .
But dear Jesus , Buddha , and Allah — surely she doesn ’ t believe it . Surely she ’ s not going to run on a platform of “ Obama was too liberal and divisive and I ’ ll unite the parties by being more centrist. ” Surely . Right ?
I don ’ t know . I have no insight into Hillaryland — she remains as opaque to me now as when I first encountered her in the news 25 years ago . But I have to believe that as an intelligent observer of U.S. politics , she can ’ t still cling to the hope that partisanship can be overcome with policy compromise and centrist technocracy . I have to believe that the awakening Pfeiffer describes has filtered down to the professional operatives who will run Clinton ’ s campaign . The alternative is too dreary to contemplate .","I missed Jonathan Chait’s “exit interview” with Dan Pfeiffer, a close Obama aide since the 2008 presidential campaign, while I was out last week snowboarding and ignoring the news.

Pfeiffer believes the dynamic is, in fact, the opposite: “The incentive structure moves from going after the diminishing middle to motivating the base.” Ever since Republicans took control of the House four years ago, attempts to court Republicans have mostly failed while simultaneously dividing Democratic voters. Obama’s most politically successful maneuvers, by contrast, have all been unilateral and liberal. “Whenever we contemplate bold progressive action,” Pfeiffer said, “whether that’s the president’s endorsement of marriage equality, or coming out strong on power-plant rules to reduce current pollution, on immigration, on net neutrality, you get a lot of hemming and hawing in advance about what this is going to mean: Is this going to alienate people? Is this going to hurt the president’s approval ratings? What will this mean in red states?” And yet, this hesitation has always proved overblown: “There’s never been a time when we’ve taken progressive action and regretted it.” This was deeply at odds with the lesson Bill Clinton and most of his aides (many of whom staffed Obama’s administration) had taken away from his presidency. But by the beginning of Obama’s second term, at least, the president seemed fully convinced. “As we were preparing for the potential that we would lose the midterms,” Pfeiffer told me, “a lot of the advice we got around town was: You have to show major contrition; heads have to roll; you have to give some sop to the Republicans. The president’s view was: No, we’re not going to do that. We’re going to go out and we’re going to be the opposite of contrite; we’re going to be aggressive in our policies and our politics. And that worked. It caused people to cheer. But that’s the exact opposite of the sort of advice you’d get in this town.” [my emphasis]

This is a really big deal. It’s hard to overstate the strength and depth of the Washington conventional wisdom: Dems should apologize for their base, tack to the center, moderate their rhetoric, and seek compromise. That CW, decades in the making, is so deeply embedded in the heads of most older journalists and politicos that it is all but impossible to dislodge, no matter how much the evidence stacks up against it.

But if Pfeiffer is right, the dam may finally be breaking. Obama’s administration has been such a searingly clear demonstration of polarization that even aides shaped by the Clinton years (when triangulation was all the rage) have been unable to avoid its implications.

—

The big question, in my mind, is whether this revelation extends beyond the White House to the Democratic Party in general, most particularly to one Hillary Rodham Clinton. She recently said that she wants to transcend red and blue and reach “a nice warm purple space where we’re trying to solve problems.”

This is the very quintessence of outdated CW. It presumes a shared pool of problems that the parties are competing to solve. But the parties do not agree on what constitutes a problem. The GOP doesn’t think climate change is a problem — or income inequality, or the lack of worker bargaining power, or the over-militarization of foreign policy, or racism in policing. What’s at issue in American politics is not technocratic differences over means, but philosophical differences over ends. There is a Red America and a Blue America and they have different values and different visions for the country. The warm purple space is draining and close to empty.

Maybe Clinton thinks she has to say stuff like this. It still resonates with low-information voters (including, for example, the Washington Post editorial page). And it was a big part of Obama’s appeal in 2008. Perhaps it’s a ritual that all new presidential candidates must act out for the benefit of an electorate exhausted by the conflicts of the passing administration.

But dear Jesus, Buddha, and Allah — surely she doesn’t believe it. Surely she’s not going to run on a platform of “Obama was too liberal and divisive and I’ll unite the parties by being more centrist.” Surely. Right?

I don’t know. I have no insight into Hillaryland — she remains as opaque to me now as when I first encountered her in the news 25 years ago. But I have to believe that as an intelligent observer of U.S. politics, she can’t still cling to the hope that partisanship can be overcome with policy compromise and centrist technocracy. I have to believe that the awakening Pfeiffer describes has filtered down to the professional operatives who will run Clinton’s campaign. The alternative is too dreary to contemplate.",www.grist.org,left,kv5BMuONBsrFcKqQ

polarization,Pew Research Center,1,http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/11/12/facebook-and-twitter-as-political-forums-two-different-dynamics/,Facebook and Twitter as political forums: Two different dynamics,2014-11-12,Jeffrey Gottfried,"Last month ’ s report from the ███ on political polarization and media habits shows that social media is a prominent way people learn about government and politics . Indeed , this recent survey shows that 48 % of internet-using adults reported getting news from Facebook in the previous week , rivaling well-known news media organizations . New data released here support the notion that two of the most prominent social networking sites , Facebook and Twitter , function very differently as sources of political information .
Overall , Facebook continues to have a much larger base of users than Twitter ( with 77 % of web-using adults on Facebook compared with just 21 % on Twitter ) . Vast majorities of both Facebook users ( 86 % ) and Twitter users ( 77 % ) see at least some political content , such as posts from friends , news organizations and political leaders , and links to news stories . And a significant percentage of each – 24 % of Twitter users and 19 % of Facebook users – say political posts account for at least half of the posts they see .
But social media users who are interested in politics have different experiences on the two sites .
Four-in-ten ( 41 % ) Twitter users who are very interested in politics say that at least half of the posts that they see are political . This compares with about a quarter ( 26 % ) of highly politically-interested Facebook users who say the same .
Conversely , roughly a third ( 34 % ) of Twitter users not interested in politics say they don ’ t see any political posts in their feed , compared with about half that amount ( 18 % ) of Facebook users who are uninterested in the subject .
There could be a number of elements at play . For one , as apparent to those familiar with both sites , the nature of each platform is different in terms of who people choose to connect with and how algorithms , particularly for Facebook , affect what people see in their feed . Also , people could be using the two sites for different purposes : Facebook users could be using the platform for a wider array of social and informational activities than Twitter users . But either way , on Twitter , those who are interested in politics see a greater portion of this type of content than their brethren on Facebook , and the politically uninterested are more likely to filter it out .
Whether these differences between sites will persist is in question , though , as the type and amount of content that users see is ever changing . For example , Facebook recently announced that it was updating its news feed algorithm since current events sometimes “ aren ’ t surfaced in a timely manner , ” according to a Facebook spokeswoman . Changes such as these can continue to influence whether users are actually seeing the content they are interested in .
Correction : An earlier version of this post inaccurately cited the percent of online adults who use Twitter . It is 21 % .","Last month’s report from the Pew Research Center on political polarization and media habits shows that social media is a prominent way people learn about government and politics. Indeed, this recent survey shows that 48% of internet-using adults reported getting news from Facebook in the previous week, rivaling well-known news media organizations. New data released here support the notion that two of the most prominent social networking sites, Facebook and Twitter, function very differently as sources of political information.

Overall, Facebook continues to have a much larger base of users than Twitter (with 77% of web-using adults on Facebook compared with just 21% on Twitter). Vast majorities of both Facebook users (86%) and Twitter users (77%) see at least some political content, such as posts from friends, news organizations and political leaders, and links to news stories. And a significant percentage of each – 24% of Twitter users and 19% of Facebook users – say political posts account for at least half of the posts they see.

But social media users who are interested in politics have different experiences on the two sites.

Four-in-ten (41%) Twitter users who are very interested in politics say that at least half of the posts that they see are political. This compares with about a quarter (26%) of highly politically-interested Facebook users who say the same.

Conversely, roughly a third (34%) of Twitter users not interested in politics say they don’t see any political posts in their feed, compared with about half that amount (18%) of Facebook users who are uninterested in the subject.

There could be a number of elements at play. For one, as apparent to those familiar with both sites, the nature of each platform is different in terms of who people choose to connect with and how algorithms, particularly for Facebook, affect what people see in their feed. Also, people could be using the two sites for different purposes: Facebook users could be using the platform for a wider array of social and informational activities than Twitter users. But either way, on Twitter, those who are interested in politics see a greater portion of this type of content than their brethren on Facebook, and the politically uninterested are more likely to filter it out.

Whether these differences between sites will persist is in question, though, as the type and amount of content that users see is ever changing. For example, Facebook recently announced that it was updating its news feed algorithm since current events sometimes “aren’t surfaced in a timely manner,” according to a Facebook spokeswoman. Changes such as these can continue to influence whether users are actually seeing the content they are interested in.

America’s strengths, & a weakness. Symptoms of political rigidity. The cause of our problems. For More Information.

(1) America’s strengths, and a weakness

Nations thrive over long periods not by luck (or not just luck), but by being adaptive, innovative, and intelligent in their public policy. What nations best deserve that description today? Singapore and the Nordic nations, certainly. Germany, Korea, and China, probably.

Does this describe the USA? Our business sector has all of these qualities, as does our society with its incredible vitality. This was also true of our political regime — in the past. But somehow, sometime since WWII, our political institutions have become rigid, even stupid.

That’s bad news, since America has a different foundation than most nations. America is its political regime. We’re not defined by ethnicity, religion, economic ideology, or even geography (although many Americans confuse these things with the nation and feel alienated when they change). We’re like Athens, but more so.

… the soul of the city was the regime, the arrangements of and participation in offices, deliberation about the just and the common good, choices about war and peace, the making of laws. … {Pericles’ famous funeral oration} says nothing about the gods, or the poetry, history, sculpture or philosophy of Athens. He praises its regime and finds beauty in its political achievement … {From Allan Bloom’s Closing of the American Mind }

It has been the basis for America’s resiliency and power. But it’s a single point of failure: When our political regime weakens, the entire nation weakens.

(2) Symptoms of political rigidity

Our handling of major threats since 2001, such as jihadists and climate change, shows this rigidity. These are complex threats, whose dynamics cross multiple intellectual disciplines. Their understanding requires knowledge and experience beyond that of any small group — certainly beyond that of most bureaucrats at the senior levels of government. America has people with the necessary experience and knowledge. But instead of consulting them, our leaders quickly choose a policy response.

What do we have to show for those decisions 13 years later? We have no effective climate change policy, not even firm direction for our expensive climate science research programs. Everything remains locked in America’s political polarization. Our long war runs even worse. Our interventions in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Yemen have been bloody failures — leaving the region aflame. Our dreams of bases in strategic Afghanistan and Iraq, from which we could project power across the region, have burned way and left nothing but the casualties.

And so it goes with most of our major public policy issues. Our infrastructure rots. Our education system is among the world’s best funded and delivers slightly below-average results. Ditto for our health care system. Our defense department has a stunning inability to consistently deliver working weapons despite spending unimaginable sums (the F-35 being the logical next step in their increasingly large fiascoes).

All of these problems have been widely known for decades, even generations. Most continue despite adequate or even lavish funding. No, it’s not an inability of “government” to function. Most of our peers run these systems much better, cheaper, and with less fuss.

(3) The cause of our problems

The problem is not our governmental structure; it’s the same as has run in the sloppy but effective manner as during the Republic’s first 200 years (1789-1989). The problem is not the two-party structure; which has run in the same messy fashion since John Adams was President. It is not polarization; western governments, including ours, often have functioned with high levels of polarization.

It’s obvious to anyone paying attention that the middle class (more accurately, the upper middle class — the professional and managerial classes I call the “outer party”) are locked in a struggle with the 1% and its allies (especially the wealthy and leadership classes I call the “inner party”) for control of America. Since roughly 1980 the 1% has been winning, rewarded by an increasing share of the national income and greater control of its public and private institutions. But the cost has been to make dysfunctional our governmental machinery.

Such internal conflicts have often disrupted societies, as their political machinery fails when social cohesion is lost. For extreme examples look at Latin American nations. In the 1920s people in Europe described rich people as being “Rich as an Argentinian.” After generations of social conflict Argentina’s GDP per capita now ranks 55th, between Gabon and Croatia.

The story of Argentine economic growth in the 20th century is one of decline unparalleled in the annals of economic history. Once one of the richest and fastest growing countries in the world, Argentina is now firmly entrenched in the ranks of less-developed countries; and the Belle Epoque, the turn-of-the-century golden age, a time of rapid growth, high culture and dreams of continued prosperity, is but a dim and distant memory for most Argentines. — From “Three Phases of Argentine Economic Growth“, Alan M.

We do not believe that they are correct about that , but President Trump nonetheless should treat the Charlottesville Nazis with the same specificity with which he denounces the New York Times , John McCain , or Judge Gonzalo P.

They are also murderous . The car attack on the counter-protesters has all the hallmarks of a by-now-familiar act of terrorism , of a piece with similar attacks we have seen from Nice to London .

The pimply-faced tiki-torch gang and their media enablers have from time to time denounced this brand of conservatism as passé , and we thank them for their denunciation . You can have the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence , or you can have your ridiculous race cult . We are confident that the lunatics in Charlottesville are not very numerous .
But they are not entirely insignificant , either . Armed brawls between neo-Nazi gangs and their left-wing equivalents are , for the moment , an ordinary part of our politics . That might get worse before it gets better . Responsible parties on both sides — which , in spite of what you may see on television , still exist — can at the very least be honest about what is happening and unequivocal in their condemnation of it .

But as we have seen in the reaction from the Nazis and their allies, they do not much care about the denunciations coming from mainstream Republican figures and conservatives. They are keenly interested in what President Trump has to say, and they have taken his thus-far mealy-mouthed “both sides do it” — his refusal to reject them specifically, strongly, and by name — as tacit indulgence, as the closest thing to a public embrace that realpolitik will allow. We do not believe that they are correct about that, but President Trump nonetheless should treat the Charlottesville Nazis with the same specificity with which he denounces the New York Times, John McCain, or Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel. The president has a great gift for ridicule, and the Charlottesville Nazis are ridiculous.

They are also murderous. The car attack on the counter-protesters has all the hallmarks of a by-now-familiar act of terrorism, of a piece with similar attacks we have seen from Nice to London.

President Trump should treat the Charlottesville Nazis with the same specificity with which he denounces the New York Times.

We categorically repudiate not only the specific acts of violence but also the broader cause in which this violence was deployed. The rally in question was advertised as a project to “Unite the Right.” We flatter ourselves that we have a little something to say about that, and our answer is: No. We do not wish to be united with Jew-haters, bigots, racists, and the morally and intellectually defective specimens on such sad display in Charlottesville, waving their Nazi banners and Confederate flags.

We, too, thrill to the sight of a rebel banner: the one raised by George Washington, the one that stands for the most subversive revolutionary creed the world has ever seen — that all men are created equal and endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights. The pimply-faced tiki-torch gang and their media enablers have from time to time denounced this brand of conservatism as passé, and we thank them for their denunciation. You can have the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, or you can have your ridiculous race cult. We are confident that the lunatics in Charlottesville are not very numerous.

But they are not entirely insignificant, either. Armed brawls between neo-Nazi gangs and their left-wing equivalents are, for the moment, an ordinary part of our politics. That might get worse before it gets better. Responsible parties on both sides — which, in spite of what you may see on television, still exist — can at the very least be honest about what is happening and unequivocal in their condemnation of it. The president has a special responsibility to set an example here, and we urge him to live up to it.

The American Interest:

At least since the 2010 midterms, it’s been a liberal talking point that Republican extremism is to blame for political polarization and gridlock. In the old days, the argument goes, Republicans were a moderate party, but over the past generation the GOP has been gradually taken over by its far-right wing.

After all, Hillary Clinton has to renounce a good chunk of her husband’s positions to be competitive in the 2016 primary. Now, a paper on polarization and inequality released in August by political scientists from Princeton, Georgetown, and the University of Oregon (and highlighted this week in a Washington Postarticle) provides some empirical evidence that Democratic Party’s leftward drift is more pronounced than the GOP’s rightward drift, at least at the state level. The study’s overall argument is that income inequality has increased political polarization at the state level since the 1990s. But the authors find that that this happens more by moving state Democratic parties to the left than by moving state Republican parties to the right.

As public debate rages about issues such as immunization , Obamacare and same-sex marriage , many people try to use science to bolster their arguments . And because it 's becoming easier to test and establish facts—whether in physics , psychology or policy—many have wondered why bias and polarization have not been defeated . When people are confronted with facts , such as the well-established safety of immunization , why do these facts seem to have so little effect ?
Our recent research , published in 2015 in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology , examined a slippery way by which people get away from facts that contradict their beliefs . Of course , sometimes people just dispute the validity of specific facts . But we find that sometimes they go one step further and , as in the opening example , reframe an issue in untestable ways . This makes potential important facts and science ultimately irrelevant to the issue .
Let 's consider the issue of same-sex marriage . Facts could be relevant to whether it should be legal—for example , if data showed that children raised by same-sex parents are worse off—or just as well-off—as children raised by opposite-sex parents . But what if those facts contradict one 's views ?
We presented 174 American participants who supported or opposed same-sex marriage with ( supposed ) scientific facts that supported or disputed their position . When the facts opposed their views , our participants—on both sides of the issue—were more likely to state that same-sex marriage is n't actually about facts , it 's more a question of moral opinion . But when the facts were on their side , they more often stated that their opinions were fact-based and much less about morals . In other words , we observed something beyond the denial of particular facts : we observed a denial of the relevance of facts .
In a similar study using 117 religious participants , we had some read an article critical of religion . Believers who were especially high ( but not low ) in religiosity were more likely to turn to more untestable “ blind faith ” arguments as reasons for their beliefs than to arguments based in factual evidence , compared with those who read a neutral article .
These experiments show that when people 's beliefs are threatened , they often take flight to a land where facts do not matter . In scientific terms , their beliefs become less “ falsifiable ” because they can no longer be tested scientifically for verification or refutation .
For instance , sometimes people dispute government policies based on the argument that they do n't work . Yet if facts suggest that the policies do work , the same person might stay resolvedly against the argument based on principle . We can see this on both sides of the political spectrum , whether it 's conservatives and Obamacare or liberals and the “ surge ” in Iraq in 2007 .
One would hope that objective facts could allow people to reach consensus more easily , but American politics are more polarized than ever . Could this polarization be a consequence of feeling free of facts ?
While it is difficult to objectively test that idea , we can experimentally assess a fundamental question : When people are made to see their important beliefs as relatively less rather than more testable , does it increase polarization and commitment to desired beliefs ? Two experiments we conducted suggest so .
In an experiment with 179 Americans ( conducted during President Barack Obama 's tenure ) , we reminded roughly half of participants that much of Obama 's policy performance was empirically testable and did not remind the other half . Then participants rated Obama 's performance on five domains ( such as job creation ) . Comparing opponents and supporters of Obama , we found that the reminder of testability reduced the average polarized assessments of Obama 's performance by about 40 percent .
To further test the hypothesis that people strengthen their desired beliefs when the beliefs are free of facts , we looked at a sample of 103 participants that varied from highly to moderately religious . We found that when highly ( but not more moderately ) religious participants were told that God 's existence will always be untestable , they reported stronger desirable religious beliefs afterward ( such as the belief that God was looking out for them ) , relative to when they were told that one day science might be able to investigate God 's existence .
Together these findings show , at least in some cases , when testable facts are less a part of the discussion , people dig deeper into the beliefs they wish to have—such as viewing a politician in a certain way or believing God is constantly there to provide support . These results bear similarities to the many studies that find when facts are fuzzier , people tend to exaggerate desired beliefs .
So after examining the power of untestable beliefs , what have we learned about dealing with human psychology ? We have learned that bias is a disease and to fight it we need a healthy treatment of facts and education . We find that when facts are injected into the conversation , the symptoms of bias become less severe . But , unfortunately , we have also learned that facts can only do so much . To avoid coming to undesirable conclusions , people can fly from the facts and use other tools in their deep , belief-protecting toolbox .
With the disease of bias , then , societal immunity is better achieved when we encourage people to accept ambiguity , engage in critical thinking and reject strict ideology . This society is something the Common Core State Standards for education and at times The Daily Show are at least in theory attempting to help create . We will never eradicate bias—not from others , not from ourselves and not from society . But we can become a people more free of ideology and less free of facts .","“There was a scientific study that showed vaccines cause autism.” “Actually, the researcher in that study lost his medical license, and overwhelming research since then has shown no link between vaccines and autism.” “Well, regardless, it's still my personal right as a parent to make decisions for my child.” Does that exchange sound familiar?

Employees of MoveOn and Planned Parenthood will make different decisions with their money than the formal Democratic Party will.

Parties, it turns out, tend to support relatively moderate candidates. They do so because, as the authors note, ""parties are the sole political organization whose primary goal is to win elections."" This is a key point. Issue activists, individual donors, and others tend to back relatively extreme candidates precisely because they want those candidates to move the government in one direction or another. They have a set of issues they care about—abortion, corporate tax rates, minimum wage levels, etc.—and they fiercely want to change the direction of government on those issues. They may end up giving to candidates to reward them for their past stances on issues and to encourage them to remain steadfast to their agenda.

The formal parties, by contrast, are chiefly concerned with winning and holding majorities in Washington, D.C., and in the state capitols. They send their money where it is most needed—usually to competitive districts where relatively moderate candidates are in close races.

So what happens when you cut party funding out of the equation? That's what a lot of states have done in recent decades, placing limits on what individuals can give to parties and what parties can contribute to candidate coffers. Basically, this hurts the more moderate candidates. The money still in the system comes disproportionately from more ideologically extreme donors and goes to more polarized candidates.

Conceptually, there's an important question in here about the nature of political parties. Unlike La Raja and Schaffner, I tend to view parties more as networks. The formal party groups are only parts of these networks, as are the unions, business groups, issue activists, and others. In this view, there really shouldn't be much of a change if parties are hampered in their ability to fund campaigns. Donors will still donate, and the money will still find a way through the networks to the candidates who need it.

La Raja and Schaffner's research, however, suggests that the path the money takes does make a difference. The employees of MoveOn and Planned Parenthood and the Service Employees International Union will make different decisions with their money than the formal Democratic Party will, and that has a big impact on who gets elected and how legislatures end up being run.

polarization,Washington Times,2,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/nov/8/antifa-targets-tucker-carlson-hit-list-expands-con/,Antifa expands its hit list as political violence escalates,2018-11-08,S.A. Miller,"When a mob of left-wing antifa activists descended Wednesday night on Fox News personality Tucker Carlson ’ s D.C. home , it signaled a new phase in the political violence and angry confrontations that now are targeting the news media .
Political violence has been rising in the U.S. since 2012 , according to the Global Terrorism Database . Increasingly aggressive activists have pushed political confrontation to the limit since 2016 , accosting Republican lawmakers and Trump administration officials in restaurants and in the halls of Congress . And now they ’ re going after conservative journalists at their homes .
“ Tucker Carlson , we will fight . We know where you sleep at night ! ” the activists allied with antifa chanted outside Mr. Carlson ’ s home .
Antifa is short of anti-fascist , though the group has anarchist leanings and targets anyone perceived as not in step with a far-left agenda .
“ Here ’ s the problem . I have four children , ” Mr. Carlson , whose wife was home alone during the disturbance , told Fox News . “ I never thought twice about leaving them home alone , but this is the reaction because this group doesn ’ t like my TV show . ”
On Capitol Hill , the overheated political debate has lawmakers increasingly working under a threat of violence .
SEE ALSO : Stephen Colbert : Antifa mob at Tucker Carlson ’ s house showed ‘ monstrous cowardice ’
Capitol police say they saw a surge in protective details assigned to lawmakers earlier in the fall , when senators were facing hallway protests during the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh .
Security details were assigned to at least two Republican senators on the Judiciary Committee , Chairman Charles E. Grassley of Iowa and Jeff Flake of Arizona .
Security details typically are assigned only to members of leadership .
Senators have mostly been away from Washington since the Kavanaugh confirmation , and it ’ s not clear whether enhanced security will still be the norm .
About 2,000 threatening incidents and communications were made against members of Congress last year , according to the House Sergeant at Arms office . That ’ s nearly double the 902 threatening incidents and communications in 2016 .
Capitol Police spokeswoman Eva Maleki refused to divulge the numbers so far for 2018 .
“ Our responsibilities include consulting with member offices on security-related matters . However , we do not comment on these consultations , provide data on the number of threat investigations , or discuss how we carry out our protective responsibilities for Congress , ” she said in a statement to The ███ .
The threats have extended to anyone entering the political arena .
California psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford is still receiving death threats and has been unable to return to work more than a month after she testified to Congress against Justice Kavanaugh during confirmation hearings , according to her legal team .
The threats started when she accused Justice Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her more than 30 years ago when the two were at high school party . The allegations were never corroborated , but her testimony nearly derailed his confirmation .
Former IRS official Lois G. Lerner told a federal judge this month that she is still getting threats stemming from her role in the tea party targeting scandal of five years ago .
She has been locked in a long legal battle trying to permanently seal her old testimony about the targeting , saying she expects a new surge of threats if her actions became publicly known .
“ We are seeing more violent events recently as there seems to be a retreat from basic democratic norms , ” said American University professor Joseph Young , a scholar of terrorism and political violence .
He said President Trump ’ s attacks on the press and reluctance to denounce violence on the right doesn ’ t help but isn ’ t the main cause .
“ Some extremists do not see the value of dialogue or compromise and are concerned with the speed of change . Most importantly , when core values seem under threat , these individuals are using violence in what they perceive as a defensive action , ” he said . “ ISIS-inspired actors always cite their actions as defensive . The Pittsburgh synagogue shooter felt that his race and people were under threat . Whether this is true or not , I think these beliefs are motivating people to violent action . ”
The threats , confrontation and violence come from extremists on the left and the right .
Cesar Sayoc , a crazed supporter of Mr. Trump , is charged with sending at least 16 pipe bomb packages to people viewed as enemies of the president , including high-profile Democrats Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama and commentators at CNN .
Left-wing activist James T. Hodgkinson opened fire on a congressional Republican softball practice in June 2017 , almost killing House Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana .
Also shot were House aide Zack Barth , lobbyist Matt Mika and U.S. Capitol Police Officer Crystal Griner , who was assigned to protect Mr. Scalise .
D.C. ’ s Metropolitan Police Department is investigating the incident at Mr. Carlson ’ s home , during which the demonstrators allegedly damaged the front door .
Fox News executives called the incident at Mr. Carlson ’ s home “ reprehensible . ”
“ The violent threats and intimidation tactics toward him and his family are completely unacceptable . We as a nation have become far too intolerant of different points of view .

Political violence has been rising in the U.S. since 2012, according to the Global Terrorism Database. Increasingly aggressive activists have pushed political confrontation to the limit since 2016, accosting Republican lawmakers and Trump administration officials in restaurants and in the halls of Congress. And now they’re going after conservative journalists at their homes.

“Tucker Carlson, we will fight. We know where you sleep at night!” the activists allied with antifa chanted outside Mr. Carlson’s home.

Antifa is short of anti-fascist, though the group has anarchist leanings and targets anyone perceived as not in step with a far-left agenda.

“Here’s the problem. I have four children,” Mr. Carlson, whose wife was home alone during the disturbance, told Fox News. “I never thought twice about leaving them home alone, but this is the reaction because this group doesn’t like my TV show.”

On Capitol Hill, the overheated political debate has lawmakers increasingly working under a threat of violence.

Capitol police say they saw a surge in protective details assigned to lawmakers earlier in the fall, when senators were facing hallway protests during the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh.

Security details were assigned to at least two Republican senators on the Judiciary Committee, Chairman Charles E. Grassley of Iowa and Jeff Flake of Arizona.

Security details typically are assigned only to members of leadership.

Senators have mostly been away from Washington since the Kavanaugh confirmation, and it’s not clear whether enhanced security will still be the norm.

About 2,000 threatening incidents and communications were made against members of Congress last year, according to the House Sergeant at Arms office. That’s nearly double the 902 threatening incidents and communications in 2016.

Capitol Police spokeswoman Eva Maleki refused to divulge the numbers so far for 2018.

“Our responsibilities include consulting with member offices on security-related matters. However, we do not comment on these consultations, provide data on the number of threat investigations, or discuss how we carry out our protective responsibilities for Congress,” she said in a statement to The Washington Times.

The threats have extended to anyone entering the political arena.

California psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford is still receiving death threats and has been unable to return to work more than a month after she testified to Congress against Justice Kavanaugh during confirmation hearings, according to her legal team.

The threats started when she accused Justice Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her more than 30 years ago when the two were at high school party. The allegations were never corroborated, but her testimony nearly derailed his confirmation.

Former IRS official Lois G. Lerner told a federal judge this month that she is still getting threats stemming from her role in the tea party targeting scandal of five years ago.

She has been locked in a long legal battle trying to permanently seal her old testimony about the targeting, saying she expects a new surge of threats if her actions became publicly known.

“We are seeing more violent events recently as there seems to be a retreat from basic democratic norms,” said American University professor Joseph Young, a scholar of terrorism and political violence.

He said President Trump’s attacks on the press and reluctance to denounce violence on the right doesn’t help but isn’t the main cause.

“Some extremists do not see the value of dialogue or compromise and are concerned with the speed of change. Most importantly, when core values seem under threat, these individuals are using violence in what they perceive as a defensive action,” he said. “ISIS-inspired actors always cite their actions as defensive. The Pittsburgh synagogue shooter felt that his race and people were under threat. Whether this is true or not, I think these beliefs are motivating people to violent action.”

The threats, confrontation and violence come from extremists on the left and the right.

Cesar Sayoc, a crazed supporter of Mr. Trump, is charged with sending at least 16 pipe bomb packages to people viewed as enemies of the president, including high-profile Democrats Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama and commentators at CNN.

Left-wing activist James T. Hodgkinson opened fire on a congressional Republican softball practice in June 2017, almost killing House Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana.

Also shot were House aide Zack Barth, lobbyist Matt Mika and U.S. Capitol Police Officer Crystal Griner, who was assigned to protect Mr. Scalise.

D.C.’s Metropolitan Police Department is investigating the incident at Mr. Carlson’s home, during which the demonstrators allegedly damaged the front door.

Fox News executives called the incident at Mr. Carlson’s home “reprehensible.”

“The violent threats and intimidation tactics toward him and his family are completely unacceptable. We as a nation have become far too intolerant of different points of view. Recent events across our country clearly highlight the need for a more civil, respectful, and inclusive national conversation. Those of us in the media and in politics bear a special obligation to all Americans, to find common ground,” Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott and Fox News President Jay Wallace said in a joint statement.

It wasn’t the first time the group went after a journalist. But they usually attack reporters covering demonstrations, such as when they hurled eggs and water bottles at D.C. police and journalists during a counter-protest against the “Unite the Right 2” rally in August.

WASHINGTON ( AP ) — Political task forces Joe Biden formed with onetime rival Bernie Sanders to solidify support among the Democratic Party ’ s progressive wing recommended Wednesday that the former vice president embrace major proposals to combat climate change and institutional racism while expanding health care coverage and rebuilding a coronavirus-ravaged economy .
But they stopped short of urging Biden ’ s full endorsement of policies that could prove too divisive for some swing voters in November , like universal health coverage under “ Medicare for All ” or the sweeping Green New Deal environmental plan .
The groups , formed in May to tackle health care , immigration , education , criminal justice reform , climate change and the economy , sought to hammer out a policy road map to best defeat President Donald Trump . Their 110 pages of recommendations should help shape the policy platform Democrats will adopt during their national convention next month — even though the entire party platform adopted in 2016 ran only about 50 pages .
The task forces sought to help Biden , a center-left establishment candidate , engage skeptical progressives who ’ d backed other 2020 candidates , especially Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren , who is under consideration for Biden ’ s running mate . Biden hoped the groups would promote party unity and help him avoid a repeat of 2016 , when many Sanders supporters remained disillusioned enough that they stayed home rather than support Hillary Clinton against Trump .
They recommend that Biden commit to moving the U.S. to being fully powered by renewable energy , and meeting other key environmental benchmarks , by 2035 . That ’ s far more ambitious than the 2050 deadline he embraced during the primary . They also call for a 100-day moratorium on deportations and a series of steps to overhaul the economy in an effort to reduce economic and racial inequality .
“ While Joe Biden and I , and our supporters , have strong disagreements about some of the most important issues facing our country , we also understand that we must come together in order to defeat Donald Trump , the most dangerous president in modern American history , ” Sanders , a Vermont senator , said in a statement . Biden thanked Sanders for “ working together to unite our party , and deliver real , lasting change for generations to come . ”
Still , the recommendations don ’ t include a ban on hydraulic fracturing that could hurt Biden in the energy-producing swing state of Pennsylvania .

polarization,Slate,0,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/02/socialism-bernie-sanders-independents-general-election.html,The Great Socialism Gap,2020-02-24,William Saletan,"For the past month , the centrist Democrats running against Sen. Bernie Sanders have begged Democratic voters not to nominate him . Former Vice President Joe Biden , former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg , and Sen. Amy Klobuchar have argued that putting a socialist atop the ticket would help President Donald Trump and hurt Democratic candidates down the ballot . These warnings are well-founded , but they haven ’ t worked . Sanders has won the popular vote in Iowa , New Hampshire , and Nevada .
Why , despite the warnings , is Sanders still winning ? One reason is that a lot of people like him and what he stands for . Another reason is that other candidates are splitting the votes of moderate Democrats , leaving him with a plurality on the left . But there ’ s a third reason : Socialism doesn ’ t freak out Democratic voters the way it freaks out other Americans . On this subject , Democrats are very different not just from Republicans , but also from independents , who represent about 40 percent of Americans and about 30 percent of the electorate . Socialism is a loser among independents , and this makes it a liability in a general election . But Democrats don ’ t feel an aversion to socialism . So perhaps they don ’ t see the extent of the political danger .
The detachment starts with Sanders voters . In a September poll taken by Data for Progress , 37 percent of them identified themselves not as progressives or liberals , but as socialists , democratic socialists , or communists . Nearly all of them endorsed democratic socialism . In a January NBC/Wall Street Journal poll , most Sanders voters endorsed socialism even without the word “ democratic ” in front of it . Only 4 percent of them opposed it . These people aren ’ t likely to buy the argument that nominating a socialist is an unnecessary risk . For them , electing a socialist is the ballgame .
But the problem goes beyond Sanders supporters . Rank-and-file Democrats , as a whole , are significantly more pro-socialist than independents are . And while Republicans , conversely , are more anti-socialist than independents are , the gap between Democrats and independents , on average , is about 10 points bigger than the gap between Republicans and independents .
Over the past year , numerous national polls have asked Americans whether they view socialism positively or negatively . In every poll , Democrats lean in favor of socialism , and independents don ’ t . In every poll , the opinions of voters or of Americans in the aggregate—Democrats , independents , and Republicans combined—add up to a net rejection of socialism .
When pollsters raise specific objections to socialism , independents tend to agree with those objections . Democrats don ’ t . In a Monmouth poll taken last spring , most Democrats said socialism wouldn ’ t take away too many individual rights . But most independents ( and therefore most voters , when the answers of Democrats , independents , and Republicans were combined ) said it would . A plurality of Democrats , 50 percent to 32 percent , said socialism was compatible with American values . But most independents and voters as a whole said it wasn ’ t .
It won ’ t surprise you to hear that Democrats are far more willing than independents to support a socialist candidate . But you might be surprised by how much bigger the partisan gap is for a socialist than for other kinds of candidates . In a Gallup poll taken last month , Democrats didn ’ t differ much from independents in their stated willingness to vote for a black , female , gay , or atheist presidential nominee . For a Muslim nominee , the gap was more then 30 net percentage points . For a socialist , it was more than 60 points . Three-quarters of Democrats were willing to vote for a socialist . Most independents—and , consequently , most of the Gallup respondents—weren ’ t .
Why are Americans more likely to refuse ( or , at least , to tell pollsters that they refuse ) to vote for a socialist than for a woman or a Muslim ? Probably because socialism isn ’ t an innate characteristic or a matter of personal faith . It ’ s a doctrine about how government should intervene in the lives of other people . That makes it a legitimate reason to vote against a candidate and therefore—unlike race , sex , or religion—a legitimate factor when you ’ re considering whether to nominate a candidate other voters won ’ t support .
This chasm endangers Sanders in a general election against Trump . In an ABC/Washington Post poll taken last summer , Biden led Trump in a hypothetical matchup by 10 points . Other potential Democratic nominees tied Trump or barely led him . Sanders held a one-point lead among independents and among voters as a whole . But when respondents were asked to choose between Trump and “ a Democratic candidate who you regard as a socialist , ” the numbers shifted . Democrats , by a margin of 82 percent to 8 percent , said they ’ d support the socialist . Independents , given the same choice , went for Trump , 50 percent to 42 percent . With their support , Trump beat the hypothetical socialist , 49 percent to 43 percent .
You could argue , based on this survey , that people who say they ’ d never vote for a socialist would , in fact , vote for Sanders anyway . He polls fairly well against Trump , and he claims that if Trump attacks him as a socialist , voters will ignore the attacks , because Trump “ lies all the time. ” But Sanders isn ’ t an accused socialist . He ’ s a self-identified socialist . A follow-up survey , taken a week ago by ABC and the Post , shows that this label would hurt him . The pollsters told half their sample that “ Sanders identifies himself as a socialist , ” and they asked whether “ his being a socialist ” made respondents more or less likely to support him against Trump . For Democrats , that information was a wash or a net plus . But for independents , it was a loser . Six percent of independents said it made them more likely to support Sanders . Thirty-seven percent said it made them less likely . *
Sanders stipulates that he ’ s a “ democratic ” socialist . That distinction helps him , but mostly among Democrats . In a Yahoo News/YouGov poll taken two weeks ago , Democrats agreed that democratic socialism was different from socialism . But a plurality of independents saw no difference . ( Voters as a whole were evenly divided . ) Only 45 percent of Democrats conceded that Sanders was a socialist ; 30 percent said he wasn ’ t . But more than 60 percent of independents and voters as a whole said Sanders was a socialist . Fewer than 20 percent said he wasn ’ t .
Running as a democratic socialist isn ’ t as lethal as running as a socialist . But it ’ s still pretty bad . In an Emerson poll taken last summer , a plurality of independents ( 42 percent to 26 percent ) said they wouldn ’ t vote for a self-described democratic socialist . In a November HarrisX poll , 64 percent of independents said they ’ d never vote for a democratic socialist . In this month ’ s Yahoo News poll , a 47 percent plurality of independents said they wouldn ’ t consider voting for a presidential candidate who called himself a democratic socialist . And in the new Post/ABC poll , 33 percent of independents said they were less likely to support Sanders after hearing that he “ identifies himself as a democratic socialist. ” *
Some advocates of a Sanders nomination believe that independents aren ’ t really in play . They argue that independents lean toward one party or the other and will vote that way , so it ’ s more important to turn out the Democratic base than to fuss over voters in the middle . That belief is mistaken . In 2016 , independents voted for Trump against Hillary Clinton , 46 percent to 42 percent . In 2018 , independents voted for Democratic House candidates against Republican House candidates , 54 percent to 42 percent . In both cases , independents made the difference .
Most Americans don ’ t like the idea of moving toward socialism , regardless of how you qualify it . In a Suffolk poll taken last spring , a slight plurality of Democrats said they ’ d be “ satisfied with a presidential candidate who thinks the United States should be more socialist. ” But steep majorities of independents ( 72 percent to 18 percent ) and voters in the aggregate ( 67 percent to 22 percent ) said they wouldn ’ t . Most Republicans wouldn ’ t vote for the Democratic nominee regardless . But these grim numbers go much further .
Democrats , perhaps because they differ from the rest of the electorate in their feelings about socialism , are bad at estimating how socialism would play in a general election . Two weeks ago , in the Yahoo News poll , a 49 percent plurality of Democrats said most , nearly all , or about half of Americans would consider voting for a presidential candidate who called himself a democratic socialist . The guess was incorrect . According to the same poll , only 35 percent of voters said they ’ d consider voting for such a candidate . Democrats got it wrong .
Yes , Sanders could try to duck the word socialism and just talk about health care and education . But even if he focuses on specific proposals—leaving labels aside—he ’ ll still face a big divide between Democrats and independents . In the Yahoo News poll , only 39 percent of Democrats opposed “ eliminating private health insurance. ” Fifty-seven percent of independents opposed that idea . Democrats overwhelmingly favored “ a guaranteed annual income ” and “ forgiveness of all student loan debt. ” Independents opposed both policies .
These numbers explain why it ’ s so hard to stop Sanders in the primary , even though his opponents are correct that in a general election , his socialism would alienate independents and hurt him . The audience to whom these opponents are speaking—the Democratic primary electorate—doesn ’ t seem to want to hear it . If Sanders wins the nomination and loses the election , it won ’ t be because Republicans , on this question , falsely accused Democrats of being out of touch with America . It will be because that accusation was true .

For the past month, the centrist Democrats running against Sen. Bernie Sanders have begged Democratic voters not to nominate him. Former Vice President Joe Biden, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar have argued that putting a socialist atop the ticket would help President Donald Trump and hurt Democratic candidates down the ballot. These warnings are well-founded, but they haven’t worked. Sanders has won the popular vote in Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada.

Why, despite the warnings, is Sanders still winning? One reason is that a lot of people like him and what he stands for. Another reason is that other candidates are splitting the votes of moderate Democrats, leaving him with a plurality on the left. But there’s a third reason: Socialism doesn’t freak out Democratic voters the way it freaks out other Americans. On this subject, Democrats are very different not just from Republicans, but also from independents, who represent about 40 percent of Americans and about 30 percent of the electorate. Socialism is a loser among independents, and this makes it a liability in a general election. But Democrats don’t feel an aversion to socialism. So perhaps they don’t see the extent of the political danger.

The detachment starts with Sanders voters. In a September poll taken by Data for Progress, 37 percent of them identified themselves not as progressives or liberals, but as socialists, democratic socialists, or communists. Nearly all of them endorsed democratic socialism. In a January NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, most Sanders voters endorsed socialism even without the word “democratic” in front of it. Only 4 percent of them opposed it. These people aren’t likely to buy the argument that nominating a socialist is an unnecessary risk. For them, electing a socialist is the ballgame.

But the problem goes beyond Sanders supporters. Rank-and-file Democrats, as a whole, are significantly more pro-socialist than independents are. And while Republicans, conversely, are more anti-socialist than independents are, the gap between Democrats and independents, on average, is about 10 points bigger than the gap between Republicans and independents.

Over the past year, numerous national polls have asked Americans whether they view socialism positively or negatively. In every poll, Democrats lean in favor of socialism, and independents don’t. In every poll, the opinions of voters or of Americans in the aggregate—Democrats, independents, and Republicans combined—add up to a net rejection of socialism.

When pollsters raise specific objections to socialism, independents tend to agree with those objections. Democrats don’t. In a Monmouth poll taken last spring, most Democrats said socialism wouldn’t take away too many individual rights. But most independents (and therefore most voters, when the answers of Democrats, independents, and Republicans were combined) said it would. A plurality of Democrats, 50 percent to 32 percent, said socialism was compatible with American values. But most independents and voters as a whole said it wasn’t.

It won’t surprise you to hear that Democrats are far more willing than independents to support a socialist candidate. But you might be surprised by how much bigger the partisan gap is for a socialist than for other kinds of candidates. In a Gallup poll taken last month, Democrats didn’t differ much from independents in their stated willingness to vote for a black, female, gay, or atheist presidential nominee. For a Muslim nominee, the gap was more then 30 net percentage points. For a socialist, it was more than 60 points. Three-quarters of Democrats were willing to vote for a socialist. Most independents—and, consequently, most of the Gallup respondents—weren’t.

Why are Americans more likely to refuse (or, at least, to tell pollsters that they refuse) to vote for a socialist than for a woman or a Muslim? Probably because socialism isn’t an innate characteristic or a matter of personal faith. It’s a doctrine about how government should intervene in the lives of other people. That makes it a legitimate reason to vote against a candidate and therefore—unlike race, sex, or religion—a legitimate factor when you’re considering whether to nominate a candidate other voters won’t support.

In July, Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J. – presumably a future presidential candidate –encouraged activists to “get up in the face of some congresspeople.”

White House press secretary Sarah Sanders was driven out of a restaurant for her political beliefs. So was Kirstjen Nielsen, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Most recently, it was Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas.

And then there was the all-out character assassination campaign against Supreme Court nominee and now-Justice Brett Kavanaugh. The campaign was waged by Senate Democrats, their media allies and angry mobs intent on destroying a good man’s life.

When their campaign failed, liberal mobs resorted to pounding on the doors of the Supreme Court and continuing their disruptive tantrums.

As Republicans, we believe in treating every American with respect and dignity. We believe political differences are not an excuse for bad behavior.

We do not “kick” those with whom we disagree. Instead, we work hard to win elections and support President Trump’s agenda – one that reflects the same respect for opportunity and liberty for all.

During the Sunday campaign event, Holder encouraged Democratic activists “to be as tough as they (Republicans) are, to be as dedicated as they are, to be as committed as they are.”

Holder is right about one thing – Republicans are indeed tough, dedicated and committed.

We are tough in the face of adversity. We are dedicated to making life better for the American people. We are committed to lifting up every single community.

The results since President Trump took office speak for themselves: record low unemployment, the largest set of tax cuts in a generation, rapid deregulation and unprecedented economic growth.

The Republican Party will continue to fight for what matters most: a brighter future for our nation. And we will do so undeterred by attacks from the left. That is how we win.",www.foxnews.com,right,snSh7rszUHkGfFWI

Over time , the Republican Party has become both increasingly conservative and heavily ideological .
The second is that internal divisions within each party began to disappear . Abortion , for instance , became a partisan issue . There are few anti-abortion Democrats and few pro-choice Republicans . If such people run for political office today , they will almost certainly lose .

Voters may not be more extreme today , but they are now much better sorted in the party system . Compared to those big tent days , conservatives are much more likely to be in the Republican Party . It ’ s the same with liberals and the Democratic Party . The centrist , moderating influence within each party has disappeared .

For example , when the subject of mandatory vaccination changes from a scientific to a political issue , individuals switch their views about the science to match the views of their political party .
Party identification has increasingly become a significant way that people assess character . Before the new polarization , people disagreed with members of the opposite party but didn ’ t see them as enemies or an out-group or a threat to America .
Today , according to a number of studies ( see Liliana Mason ’ s “ Party Polarization Is Making Us More Prejudiced , ” in the Hopkins and Sides book ) , party identification is now much deeper than just a political cue . It has become a deeply engrained psychological trigger that brings out strong expressions of hostility toward opponents .

There has been a large and significant drop in the percentage of parents who are okay with their children marrying someone from the opposite political party. In 1960 only 5 percent disapproved of such marriage. In 2010 40 percent (50 percent of the Republicans, 30 percent of Democrats) disapproved.

This disapproval is part of America’s new form of political polarization. Today’s polarization is new because it takes on a different and deeper dimension. It goes well beyond incivility and difference. This new polarization is nastier and more encompassing. It is social and psychological as well as political. It goes where older forms of polarization never went before.

Political polarization itself is not new. Historically, political polarization in the U.S. has been more the rule than the exception. The period from about 1950 to the late 1970s was the only time when bipartisanship was strong. (See the essays by Nolan McCarty, David W Brady and Hahrie Han in Daniel J. Hopkins and John Sides’ “Political Polarization in American Politics.”)

No More ‘Big Tents’

To understand how polarization has changed, let’s take a brief look at its older forms. Until the 1970s the Republican and Democratic parties had significant differences, but there were enough moderates in both parties to mitigate many of these differences. Everything was not so political. Many issues, including abortion, were not seen as political issues, certainly not as partisan ones.

Now Democrats and Republicans strongly differ on packages of issues, making it impossible to pass legislation by unbundling one of these issues from the others.

But, as the public’s changing views on inter-party marriage indicates, the new polarization goes far beyond Congress.

Not Just Wrong, but Morally Bereft

Despite the increase in the number of voters who call themselves independents, party identification has become a powerful guide in new ways.

Partisanship increasingly determines a person’s positions on issues. “Voters are primarily changing their issue positions to match their partisanship rather than switching to the party that reflects their stance on issues,” wrote Nolan McCarty in “What We know and Do Not Know About our Polarized Politics,” in the Hopkins and Sides book.

Congress is no longer engaged in simply in the old form of polarization.

Hawaii May be Different

In sum, polarization has changed both in form and in breadth. There is more hate, more anger, more partisan divisiveness, and more politics. It is not much of an exaggeration to say that now everything has become political.

The new polarization is the product of some deep and long-term forces that are very difficult to change. It has taken on a psychological dimension that is very difficult to modify. Anyone who has been through therapy can tell you that.

Whether you consider Congress or the average person, the issue is far deeper than mere incivility. It is hard to be civil toward a person you hate, distrust, and want to humiliate.

This new polarization is not as evident in Hawaii because, given the weakness of the Republican Party here, there are few opportunities for it to manifest itself.

Has Hawaii changed the same way? Have those deep psychological and partisan structures developed here also?

We really can’t say because there are no such studies of Hawaii. As I have argued before, we know precious little about Hawaii’s political culture. Wouldn’t it be fascinating to know whether interparty marriage has become a bugaboo here?

If so, that could be a real problem for Republican parents because the Republican dating and mating pool is so small.

And that suggests why Hawaii may be different.

Mickler Jr. Student journalism at Georgetown can be traced as far back as 1824 to the appearance of a hand-copied publication titled “ Minerva. ” ███ , however , was distinguished from previous student publications by its intent to be a comprehensive university newspaper . The publication took its name from the phrase “ Hoya Saxa , ” which had been adopted as a common chant at Georgetown sports events in the 1890s . The popularity of the term spread as local newspapers often cited ███ , and “ Hoya ” began to be widely applied to campus organizations and to athletic groups .
Beginning in the 1940s , the publication shifted its main coverage from athletic to campus events . Weathering the Great Depression , World War II , student unrest in the 1960s and funding cuts in the 1970s , ███ has appeared almost continuously since its founding , providing a student perspective on issues and events .
In its early years , ███ published once a week , focused mainly on internal , campus affairs , promoting student organizations and school functions , and devoted a large part of its coverage to sports . In 1930 , ███ received the highest rating given to a college weekly publication by the National Collegiate Press Association .
In the late 1930s , international events began to influence content . ███ was one of the few student groups to remain active during the war years , and its pages at this time juxtapose coverage of blood drives , war bond programs and alumni casualties with details of tea dances and intramural athletics .
In the post-war era , the paper ’ s focus returned to internal campus issues , perhaps reflecting the desire of veterans , who made up most of the student body , to return to normal life . The 1950s saw the introduction of two recurring features : the Basketball Preview , which first appeared on Dec. 3 , 1957 , and the April Fools ’ issue .
One of the high points of ███ ’ s entertainment reporting came in 1964 , when one of its reporters managed to interview The Beatles , who were in Washington , D.C. , for their first live concert appearance in the United States . The interview appeared in the Feb. 20 , 1964 issue .
In the 1970s , university support for the paper fell significantly ; for example , funding was cut more than 55 percent between 1971 and 1975 . As a result , the newspaper was forced to increase its advertising fourfold and full page advertisements became common . The paper changed its format from tabloid to broadsheet in the fall of 1976 . As the Georgetown student body became more diverse , coverage of minority student groups increased , and articles on the activities and concerns of black and Jewish students appeared .
Women ’ s athletics received more detailed coverage , as did the impact of Title IX , and by the end of the decade , references to “ girls ” and “ hoyettes ” had been eliminated from the sports pages . Issues in the spring of 1973 contained coverage of attempts by gay students to organize and obtain official recognition .
The years of 1973 and 1974 saw a number of articles on the Nixon administration and the Watergate scandal . The coverage of Watergate is possibly linked to the fact that a number of players in the Watergate investigations had Georgetown connections .
In the post-Watergate era , perhaps influenced by the event , ███ began to run investigative journalism pieces . As a result , the paper went from being viewed as generally supportive of the administration to being one of the university ’ s chief antagonists . The spring of 1977 brought perhaps the most significant example of this when a story about the firing of five resident assistants led to a university hearing about the entire residential life system and , ultimately , to the resignation of both a vice president and a dean .
A number of significant changes to ███ ’ s production occurred during the 1980s . The first issue of 1980 , produced on Jan. 25 , was the first to appear without the approval of a faculty moderator who had previously been a member of the editorial board . And , after six decades of appearing once a week , ███ moved to a twice-weekly schedule beginning in the fall of 1987 . Other changes included the adoption of the current Hoya masthead in 1982 and the development of standard typefaces for headlines and copy .
The 1990s saw the consolidation and expansion of ███ ’ s entertainment coverage into a pullout arts and lifestyle section titled The Guide . The paper already had a long tradition of providing coverage and reviews of both on-campus and off-campus entertainment , with reviews of off-campus plays and movies first appearing in 1929 .
In 1998 , ███ launched a website , thehoya.com . ███ currently has one official blog , The Fourth Edition , launched in 2012 , which provides a lighthearted take on Georgetown and D.C. news . The paper ’ s other blog , Hoya Paranoia , which launched in 2008 , used to cover university athletics throughout the year as well as providing commentary on national and international sports news but stopped being used in 2016 . ███ joined Facebook in 2008 and has been on Twitter since 2009 .
In 2004 , the newspaper began its official bid to gain financial independence from the university . Late in 2004 , the newspaper launched a publicity bid to build grassroots support for the proposition ; however , the move failed to galvanize widespread support . The newspaper relaunched the campaign in early 2008 and circulated a petition that gained over 600 signatures from students and alumni . Though this campaign may have been successful , an April Fools ’ issue in 2009 put a hold on the independence movement . The issue included several articles that were perceived as racist and insensitive . The newspaper faced significant sanctions for the issue .
In a Letter From the Editor in the first issue of the fall 2010 semester , ███ acknowledged that the notorious April Fools ’ day issue of 2009 was distasteful but assured its readers that the newspaper would no longer participate in satirical issues . No April Fools ’ issues have been published since 2009 .
Negotiations for independence are currently ongoing , although ███ ’ s board of directors voted in 2010 to delay independence until the national economy and the paper ’ s financial situation becomes more favorable .","The Founding

The first issue of The Hoya was published on Jan. 14, 1920, under the editorship of Joseph R. Mickler Jr. Student journalism at Georgetown can be traced as far back as 1824 to the appearance of a hand-copied publication titled “Minerva.” The Hoya, however, was distinguished from previous student publications by its intent to be a comprehensive university newspaper. The publication took its name from the phrase “Hoya Saxa,” which had been adopted as a common chant at Georgetown sports events in the 1890s. The popularity of the term spread as local newspapers often cited The Hoya, and “Hoya” began to be widely applied to campus organizations and to athletic groups.

The First 40 Years

Beginning in the 1940s, the publication shifted its main coverage from athletic to campus events. Weathering the Great Depression, World War II, student unrest in the 1960s and funding cuts in the 1970s, The Hoya has appeared almost continuously since its founding, providing a student perspective on issues and events.

In its early years, The Hoya published once a week, focused mainly on internal, campus affairs, promoting student organizations and school functions, and devoted a large part of its coverage to sports. In 1930, The Hoya received the highest rating given to a college weekly publication by the National Collegiate Press Association.

In the late 1930s, international events began to influence content. The Hoya was one of the few student groups to remain active during the war years, and its pages at this time juxtapose coverage of blood drives, war bond programs and alumni casualties with details of tea dances and intramural athletics.

In the post-war era, the paper’s focus returned to internal campus issues, perhaps reflecting the desire of veterans, who made up most of the student body, to return to normal life. The 1950s saw the introduction of two recurring features: the Basketball Preview, which first appeared on Dec. 3, 1957, and the April Fools’ issue.

One of the high points of The Hoya’s entertainment reporting came in 1964, when one of its reporters managed to interview The Beatles, who were in Washington, D.C., for their first live concert appearance in the United States. The interview appeared in the Feb. 20, 1964 issue.

The 1970s and Watergate

In the 1970s, university support for the paper fell significantly; for example, funding was cut more than 55 percent between 1971 and 1975. As a result, the newspaper was forced to increase its advertising fourfold and full page advertisements became common. The paper changed its format from tabloid to broadsheet in the fall of 1976. As the Georgetown student body became more diverse, coverage of minority student groups increased, and articles on the activities and concerns of black and Jewish students appeared.

Women’s athletics received more detailed coverage, as did the impact of Title IX, and by the end of the decade, references to “girls” and “hoyettes” had been eliminated from the sports pages. Issues in the spring of 1973 contained coverage of attempts by gay students to organize and obtain official recognition.

The years of 1973 and 1974 saw a number of articles on the Nixon administration and the Watergate scandal. The coverage of Watergate is possibly linked to the fact that a number of players in the Watergate investigations had Georgetown connections.

In the post-Watergate era, perhaps influenced by the event, The Hoya began to run investigative journalism pieces. As a result, the paper went from being viewed as generally supportive of the administration to being one of the university’s chief antagonists. The spring of 1977 brought perhaps the most significant example of this when a story about the firing of five resident assistants led to a university hearing about the entire residential life system and, ultimately, to the resignation of both a vice president and a dean.

The 1980s and Expansion

A number of significant changes to The Hoya’s production occurred during the 1980s. The first issue of 1980, produced on Jan. 25, was the first to appear without the approval of a faculty moderator who had previously been a member of the editorial board. And, after six decades of appearing once a week, The Hoya moved to a twice-weekly schedule beginning in the fall of 1987. Other changes included the adoption of the current Hoya masthead in 1982 and the development of standard typefaces for headlines and copy.

The 1990s to Present

The 1990s saw the consolidation and expansion of The Hoya’s entertainment coverage into a pullout arts and lifestyle section titled The Guide. The paper already had a long tradition of providing coverage and reviews of both on-campus and off-campus entertainment, with reviews of off-campus plays and movies first appearing in 1929.

In 1998, The Hoya launched a website, thehoya.com. The Hoya currently has one official blog, The Fourth Edition, launched in 2012, which provides a lighthearted take on Georgetown and D.C. news. The paper’s other blog, Hoya Paranoia, which launched in 2008, used to cover university athletics throughout the year as well as providing commentary on national and international sports news but stopped being used in 2016. The Hoya joined Facebook in 2008 and has been on Twitter since 2009.

The Campaign for Independence

In 2004, the newspaper began its official bid to gain financial independence from the university. Late in 2004, the newspaper launched a publicity bid to build grassroots support for the proposition; however, the move failed to galvanize widespread support. The newspaper relaunched the campaign in early 2008 and circulated a petition that gained over 600 signatures from students and alumni. Though this campaign may have been successful, an April Fools’ issue in 2009 put a hold on the independence movement. The issue included several articles that were perceived as racist and insensitive. The newspaper faced significant sanctions for the issue.

In a Letter From the Editor in the first issue of the fall 2010 semester, The Hoya acknowledged that the notorious April Fools’ day issue of 2009 was distasteful but assured its readers that the newspaper would no longer participate in satirical issues. No April Fools’ issues have been published since 2009.

Negotiations for independence are currently ongoing, although The Hoya’s board of directors voted in 2010 to delay independence until the national economy and the paper’s financial situation becomes more favorable.",www.thehoya.com,center,rqncTUWhXMusU5BS

polarization,National Journal,1,http://www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/how-politics-breaks-our-brains-and-how-we-can-put-them-back-together-20140919,The Battle for Your Brain,,"Dave Mann, Nora Caplan-Bricker, Jason Plautz, Brianna Mcclane, Christopher Snow Hopkins, James Kitfieldfawn Johnson, Adam Mazmanian, Margot Sanger-Katz, ""Jim OSullivan""","I ’ m ly­ing in the met­al coffin of an MRI ma­chine , listen­ing to what sounds like jack­ham­mers and smelling my own breath go stale . My head is se­cured in place . I have a pan­ic but­ton . I won ’ t press it , but I do grip it tightly . Above me , faces flash on a screen .
Some are hu­man , oth­ers are dolls , and some are di­git­ally blen­ded to be something in between . It ’ s my job to fig­ure out which are which . And as I do , re­search­ers at New York Uni­versity ’ s brain-ima­ging cen­ter are track­ing what goes on in my head .
I ’ m not sick , and we ’ re not here to test my calm in the face of claus­tro­pho­bia . In­stead , I ’ m a sub­ject for re­search on a big­ger ques­tion : Is the hu­man polit­ic­al brain broken ?
The NYU team is try­ing to show that our brains are hard­wired for par­tis­an­ship and how that skews our per­cep­tions in pub­lic life . Re­search at NYU and else­where is un­der­scor­ing just how blind the “ us-versus-them ” mind-set can make people when they try to pro­cess new polit­ic­al in­form­a­tion . Once this par­tis­an­ship men­tal­ity kicks in , the brain al­most auto­mat­ic­ally pre-fil­ters facts — even non­con­tro­ver­sial ones — that of­fend our polit­ic­al sens­ib­il­it­ies .
“ Once you trip this wire , this trig­ger , this cue , that you are a part of ‘ us-versus-them , ’ it ’ s al­most like the whole brain be­comes re-co­ordin­ated in how it views people , ” says Jay Van Bavel , the lead­er of NYU ’ s So­cial Per­cep­tion and Eval­u­ation Lab .
Our tend­ency to­ward par­tis­an­ship is likely the res­ult of evol­u­tion — form­ing groups is how pre­his­tor­ic hu­mans sur­vived . That ’ s help­ful when try­ing to mas­ter an un­for­giv­ing en­vir­on­ment with Stone Age tech­no­logy . It ’ s less so when try­ing to foster a func­tion­al demo­cracy .
Un­der­stand­ing the oth­er side ’ s point of view , even if one dis­agrees with it , is cent­ral to com­prom­ise , poli­cy­mak­ing , and any hope for ci­vil­ity in civic life . So if our brains are blind­ing us to in­form­a­tion that chal­lenges our par­tis­an pre­dis­pos­i­tion , how can we hope ever to find com­mon ground ? It ’ s a chal­lenge that is stump­ing both the elect­or­ate and the elec­ted of­fi­cials who rep­res­ent them . Con­gres­sion­al hear­ings are hear­ings in name only — op­por­tun­it­ies for politi­cians to grand­stand rather than talk with each oth­er . And the polit­ic­al dis­cus­sion , even among those well versed in the is­sues , largely ex­ists in par­al­lel red and blue uni­verses , men­tal spheres with few or no com­mon facts to serve as start­ing points .
But rather than des­pair , many polit­ic­al-psy­cho­logy re­search­ers see their res­ults as reas­on for hope , and they raise a tan­tal­iz­ing pro­spect : With enough un­der­stand­ing of what ex­actly makes us so vul­ner­able to par­tis­an­ship , can we re­shape our polit­ic­al en­vir­on­ment to ac­cess the bet­ter an­gels of our neur­o­lo­gic­al nature ?
WHAT DOES ANY OF this have to do with pho­tos of dolls ? The re­search­ers are test­ing one of par­tis­an­ship ’ s more fright­en­ing fea­tures : It al­lows us , even pushes us , to de­hu­man­ize those we cat­egor­ize as “ them . ”
I ’ m tasked with dis­tin­guish­ing hu­mans from non­hu­mans , and it ’ s not as easy as it sounds . While some of the faces ap­pear to be nor­mal pho­to­graphs of men and wo­men , oth­ers are warped in­to something that would have scared me as a child — faces that look like masks . They have no creases in their pla­sticky skin , and their big , anime-style eyes shine death stares . They are dis­tinctly non­hu­man . It ’ s the ones in between that pose the prob­lem , however . A face that ’ s 90 per­cent hu­man and 10 per­cent doll is plainly seen as hu­man . But when the face is 50 per­cent doll and 50 per­cent hu­man , that ’ s where par­tis­an per­spect­ive takes over .
Re­search­ers test par­tis­an­ship by ask­ing par­ti­cipants to dis­tin­guish hu­man from non­hu­man faces . ( Journ­al of Ex­per­i­ment­al So­cial Psy­cho­logy 52 ( 2014 ) 15 ” “ 23/Hack­el et al. , JESP , 2014 ) For the first tri­al I am just shown a set of faces , but for the next run , Van Bavel in­tro­duces a twist : The faces are di­vided in­to two groups . Be­fore I see the first group , the Amer­ic­an flag flashes , and I ’ m told I ’ m look­ing at my coun­try­men . Be­fore the second , a Rus­si­an flag ap­pears . These are faces of Rus­si­ans .
As I try to as­sess which faces have a soul be­hind them , a dark fa­cet of par­tis­an psy­cho­logy sur­faces . If the face be­longs to a team mem­ber — in my case , an Amer­ic­an — I ’ m more likely to as­sign them hu­man­ity . I ’ m less in­clined to do the same for Rus­si­ans .
It ’ s not en­tirely my fault — or , at least , not the fault of any con­scious de­cisions . In­stead , it ’ s just my brain pro­cess fol­low­ing a well-worn pat­tern . When Van Bavel looks at the brain scans of people in his doll­house ex­per­i­ment , he finds that the brain re­gions used to em­path­ize with oth­ers aren ’ t as act­ive when a per­son is eval­u­at­ing faces he or she has been told be­long to the oth­er team .
HU­MANS ’ WILL­ING­NESS TO de­hu­man­ize is of­ten men­tioned along­side some of the darkest chapters of his­tory — the Holo­caust , gen­o­cide in Rwanda , the Kh­mer Rouge — when re­gimes went to great lengths to build an­ger against “ the oth­er. ” In my case , the ex­per­i­ment re­lies on a na­tion­al iden­tity re­in­forced since birth .
But to cre­ate the base “ us and them ” struc­ture , none of that is needed . The brain is so hard­wired to build such groups that Van Bavel says he can turn any­one on the street in­to a par­tis­an . “ I can do it in five minutes with a ran­dom stranger , ” he says . All it takes is a coin flip .
“ Some­body comes in­to your lab and you tell them , ‘ You ’ re part of the blue team , ’ ” he ex­plains . “ The next per­son who comes in , you flip a coin , let ’ s say it comes up the oth­er way . And you say , ‘ You ’ re on the red team. ’ “
That ’ s it . The team­mates nev­er have to meet . Or in­ter­act . There doesn ’ t need to be any­thing at stake . But with­in minutes , these in­sta-par­tis­ans like their team­mates bet­ter than they like the oth­er guys . And it shows when Van Bavel puts his sub­jects through his MRI doll­house .
Red-team mem­bers are more likely to see hu­mans when they ’ re told they ’ re look­ing at fel­low red-team faces . Blue-team mem­bers re­spond the same way . Oth­er tests re­veal that red-team mem­bers re­mem­ber red-team faces more ac­cur­ately , and if Van Bavel asks sub­jects to al­loc­ate money , red-team mem­bers will pay out more to their own . Team mem­bers also have less sym­pathy for those on the oth­er side , and even ex­per­i­ence pleas­ure while read­ing about their pain .
I ’ m not just in­side the MRI to be stumped by Rus­si­an dolls . The re­search­ers are also check­ing to see if my brain has a con­ser­vat­ive or lib­er­al shape .
The au­thor be­ing loaded in­to an MRI ma­chine . ( Reena Flores ) In 2011 , a team of Brit­ish sci­ent­ists pub­lished a pa­per that found that brain struc­tures cor­rel­ated with polit­ic­al ori­ent­a­tion . Spe­cific­ally , con­ser­vat­ives ten­ded to have lar­ger amy­g­dala areas — brain mat­ter that plays a role in fear con­di­tion­ing — than lib­er­als . The res­ults ad­ded to a body of re­search that finds con­ser­vat­ives and lib­er­als have dif­fer­ent physiolo­gic­al re­sponses to the en­vir­on­ment , and even per­ceive the world dif­fer­ently .
At NYU , they ’ re test­ing that con­clu­sion , and the mag­nets around me are meas­ur­ing the volume of my amy­g­dala . Be­fore my MRI , I took a test aimed at giv­ing me a score on the re­search­ers ’ “ sys­tem-jus­ti­fic­a­tion scale , ” a meas­ure that cor­rel­ates with one com­pon­ent of where a per­son falls on the lib­er­al-to-con­ser­vat­ive spec­trum . People who score high on sys­tem jus­ti­fic­a­tion tend to be pat­ri­ot­ic and de­fend­ers of the status quo . Those who score low tend to be the rebels . So far , with 100 par­ti­cipants , Van Bavel ’ s group is find­ing mean­ing­ful dif­fer­ences between the brains of high sys­tem-jus­ti­fi­ers and low sys­tem-jus­ti­fi­ers .
( Col­leagues joked that I might want to keep my test res­ults to my­self if I wanted to con­tin­ue work­ing as a non­par­tis­an journ­al­ist in Wash­ing­ton . But — for the re­cord — I ’ m a lab-cer­ti­fied mod­er­ate : “ Yeah , you were right in the heart of the dis­tri­bu­tion , not only in the terms of your sys­tem-jus­ti­fic­a­tion tend­en­cies but also your amy­g­dala volume is very healthy , ” Van Bavel tells me the day after , laugh­ing . )
BUT WHEN IT COMES to Amer­ic­an polit­ics , how troubled should we be by any of these find­ings ? Amer­ica ’ s par­tis­an di­vide is as old as Amer­ica ’ s demo­cracy . And it ’ s neither feas­ible nor de­sir­able to hope for a na­tion­al con­sensus on every is­sue . Even if we all worked from the same set of facts , and even if we all un­der­stood those facts per­fectly , dif­fer­ences of opin­ion would — and should — re­main . Those opin­ions are not the prob­lem . The trouble is when we ’ re so blinded by our par­tis­an­ship that it over­rides reas­on — and re­search sug­gests that is hap­pen­ing all the time .
With just a hint of par­tis­an prim­ing , an Ari­zona State Uni­versity re­search­er was able to in­stantly blind Demo­crats to a non­con­tro­ver­sial fact , lead­ing them im­me­di­ately to fail to solve the easi­est of math prob­lems . In the 2010 ex­per­i­ment , polit­ic­al sci­ent­ist Mark Ramirez asked sub­jects two sim­il­ar ques­tions . The con­trol group saw this ques­tion : “ Would you say that com­pared to 2008 , the level of un­em­ploy­ment in this coun­try has got­ten bet­ter , stayed the same , or got­ten worse ? ” A sep­ar­ate group saw this one : “ Would you say that the level of un­em­ploy­ment in this coun­try has got­ten bet­ter , stayed the same , or got­ten worse since Barack Obama was elec­ted Pres­id­ent ? ”
The key dif­fer­ence between the two : the first men­tions the time peri­od for as­sess­ing un­em­ploy­ment , while the second frames the is­sue around Pres­id­ent Obama . When asked the first ques­tion , Demo­crats and Re­pub­lic­ans re­spon­ded sim­il­arly , with most say­ing un­em­ploy­ment had re­mained about the same . But among sub­jects who got the second ques­tion , opin­ions shif­ted along par­tis­an lines : Around 60 per­cent of Demo­crats said un­em­ploy­ment had got­ten bet­ter or some­what bet­ter , and about 75 per­cent of Re­pub­lic­ans said the op­pos­ite .
In fact , the un­em­ploy­ment rate in­creased between Obama ’ s elec­tion and Ramirez ’ s study . One can ar­gue about wheth­er this is a fair frame for eval­u­at­ing this or any pres­id­ent ’ s eco­nom­ic re­cord , but from a raw-num­bers per­spect­ive , the rise in the un­em­ploy­ment rate between 2008 and 2010 is in­dis­put­able .
But even giv­ing Demo­crats that in­form­a­tion did not in­crease the ac­cur­acy of their re­sponses . Ramirez ’ s study asked some par­ti­cipants the fol­low­ing ques­tion : “ The U.S. Bur­eau of Labor Stat­ist­ics shows un­em­ploy­ment has in­creased by 4.6 per­cent since 2008 . Would you say that the level of un­em­ploy­ment in this coun­try has got­ten bet­ter , stayed the same , or got­ten worse since Barack Obama was elec­ted Pres­id­ent ? ”
Clearly , the an­swer is in the sen­tence that im­me­di­ately pre­cedes the ques­tion . But the men­tion of Obama launched a par­tis­an men­tal pro­cess that led many astray : Nearly 60 per­cent of Demo­crats said un­em­ploy­ment had lessened since Obama ’ s elec­tion .
Es­sen­tially , once Demo­crats fo­cused on Obama , most of them largely ig­nored the facts . ( About 80 per­cent of Re­pub­lic­ans got the an­swer right when it was spoon-fed to them , but Re­pub­lic­ans temp­ted to cry vic­tory should be cau­tioned that re­search­ers have found them to be sim­il­arly off base in as­sess­ing the eco­nomy when one of their own is in the Oval Of­fice . )
Ramirez ’ s ex­per­i­ment also re­veals that our bi­ases don ’ t com­pletely blind us to in­form­a­tion , however . When he gave Demo­crats the cor­rect un­em­ploy­ment stat­ist­ics , it did not change their an­swers , but it did make them less con­fid­ent in those re­sponses , as re­por­ted in a post-test ques­tion­naire . “ It tells me that people might ac­tu­ally be pro­cessing the in­form­a­tion in an un­biased way , ” Ramirez says .
The ques­tion , then , is how to amp­li­fy that un­biased pro­cessing to over­come the par­tis­an blind­ness .
BRENDAN NYHAN KNOWS just how hard it is to move that men­tal needle .
“ I had the dream of , if we give people the right in­form­a­tion , it ’ ll make a dif­fer­ence , ” says Nyhan , a polit­ic­al sci­ent­ist at Dart­mouth and con­trib­ut­or to The New York Times ‘ s The Up­shot .
But after 15 years of throw­ing facts in people ’ s faces , Nyhan has found the mat­ter to be much more com­plic­ated . In the early 2000s , he cofoun­ded the fact-check­ing web­site Spin­san­ity to com­bat the “ he said , she said ” cov­er­age he saw in the me­dia . “ I ’ m very proud of the work we did , but it did il­lus­trate how hard it was to change people ’ s minds , even among the se­lect group of people who were will­ing to take the time to read a non­par­tis­an fact-check­ing web­site , ” Nyhan said .
More re­cently , Nyhan at­temp­ted to de­bunk an ar­gu­ment that is grow­ing in pop­ular­ity but ut­terly lack­ing in sci­entif­ic sup­port : that par­ents shouldn ’ t have their chil­dren vac­cin­ated .
Nyhan and his col­lab­or­at­ors wanted to con­vince par­ents who were against vac­cin­a­tions that their op­pos­i­tion was un­foun­ded . Work­ing with a large sample of 1,759 par­ents , the team sent them a vari­ety of ma­ter­i­al , in­clud­ing pamph­lets that ex­plained the lack of evid­ence link­ing vac­cin­a­tions with aut­ism , ex­plan­a­tions of the dangers of measles , pho­tos of sick chil­dren whose dis­eases could have been pre­ven­ted , and a story about an in­fant who al­most died from in­fec­tion . Some were ap­peals to pure reas­on ; some were ap­peals to pure emo­tion .
Noth­ing worked . One of the in­ter­ven­tions — the pamph­let ex­plain­ing the lack of evid­ence — ac­tu­ally made anti-vac­cin­a­tion par­ents even less in­clined to vac­cin­ate . “ Some of the con­clu­sions of that re­search people find pretty de­press­ing , ” Nyhan says . “ My­self in­cluded . ”
In an­oth­er study , Nyhan wanted to see if he could find a real-world way to press ac­tu­al politi­cians to be bet­ter hand­lers of the facts . In the months lead­ing up to the 2012 elec­tion , Nyhan and coau­thor Jason Reifler per­formed an ex­per­i­ment on 1,169 un­wit­ting state le­gis­lat­ors . They wanted to see if fact checks could mo­tiv­ate the politi­cians to be more truth­ful . A third of the le­gis­lat­ors re­ceived a let­ter that con­tained a veiled threat . It read : “ Politi­cians who lie put their repu­ta­tions and ca­reers at risk , but only when those lies are ex­posed. ” The let­ter then re­minded the politi­cians that Poli­ti­Fact , a fact-check­ing group , op­er­ated in their state . The let­ter clearly im­plied , “ Poli­ti­Fact will be watch­ing you. ” An­oth­er third of the law­makers re­ceived a let­ter that ex­cluded ref­er­ences to fact check­ing . The last third re­ceived no let­ter .
Throughout the elec­tion cycle , Nyhan and Reifler logged the politi­cians ’ Poli­ti­Fact rat­ings ( from “ true ” to “ pants on fire ” ) . They also had a re­search as­sist­ant comb through the me­dia cov­er­age of each le­gis­lat­or , search­ing for crit­ic­al stor­ies . The res­ults , pending pub­lic­a­tion in the Amer­ic­an Journ­al of Polit­ic­al Sci­ence , were lim­ited but prom­ising . Over­all , only a very few le­gis­lat­ors — 27 out of 1,169 — were called out on lies . But of those 27 , only five had re­ceived the threat­en­ing let­ter — less than a third . That ’ s reas­on enough to re­search the idea fur­ther . “ This study was a first step , ” Nyhan says .
One way to help people look past their in­nate par­tis­an­ship ? Pay them to do it .
“ Hu­man psy­cho­logy isn ’ t go­ing to change , ” he says . “ The factors that make people vul­ner­able to mis­in­form­a­tion aren ’ t go­ing to change . But the in­cent­ives fa­cing elites can change , and we can design in­sti­tu­tions that func­tion bet­ter or worse un­der po­lar­iz­a­tion and that do a bet­ter or worse job at provid­ing in­cent­ives to make ac­cur­ate state­ments . ”
THERE ’ S AN EASI­ER WAY to help people look past their in­nate par­tis­an­ship : Pay them to do it .
A 2013 study out of Prin­ceton found that mon­et­ary in­cent­ives at­ten­u­ate the par­tis­an gap in an­swers to ques­tions about the eco­nomy . The re­search­ers de­signed an ex­per­i­ment sim­il­ar to Ramirez ’ s un­em­ploy­ment study but with a modi­fic­a­tion : Some par­ti­cipants were plainly in­formed , “ We will pay you for an­swer­ing cor­rectly. ” All it took was $ 1 or $ 2 to dra­mat­ic­ally im­prove the chances of a right an­swer , cut­ting the par­tis­an gap between Re­pub­lic­ans and Demo­crats in half — half !
Of course , a mass “ pay Amer­ic­ans to pay more at­ten­tion to facts ” cam­paign isn ’ t hap­pen­ing . So the ques­tion , then , is how do we get people to be more ob­ject­ive , without throw­ing money at them ?
Jimmy Carter dis­covered one an­swer dur­ing the 1978 peace ne­go­ti­ations between Egyp­tian Pres­id­ent An­war Sad­at and Is­raeli Prime Min­is­ter Men­a­chem Be­gin . The talks were on the brink of col­lapsing in their fi­nal hours , and the prime min­is­ter was pre­pared to walk . That ’ s when Carter dir­ec­ted his sec­ret­ary to find out all the names of Be­gin ’ s grand­chil­dren . Carter auto­graphed pho­tos for them and per­son­ally gave them to the Is­raeli lead­er . “ He had taken a blood oath that he would nev­er dis­mantle an Is­raeli set­tle­ment , ” Carter later re­called in an in­ter­view . “ He looked at those eight pho­to­graphs and tears began to run down his cheeks — and mine — as he read the names . ”
A few minutes later , Be­gin was back at the ne­go­ti­at­ing table . By ap­peal­ing to a non­polit­ic­al idea Be­gin cared about — his fam­ily — Carter was able to bring him to a place where he could bend .
In 1978 , Jimmy Carter ’ s ap­peal to Is­raeli Prime Min­is­ter Men­a­chem Be­gin ’ s sense of fam­ily kept Be­gin at the ne­go­ti­at­ing table with Egyp­tian Pres­id­ent An­war Sad­at . ( AP Photo/Bob Daugh­erty ) The tech­nique works even when world peace isn ’ t on the line . Kev­in Bin­ning , a Uni­versity of Pitt­s­burgh psy­cho­lo­gist , used it to re­shape the way par­tis­ans re­acted to a 2008 pres­id­en­tial de­bate .
Just two days be­fore the elec­tion , Bin­ning as­sembled 110 self-iden­ti­fied Re­pub­lic­ans and Demo­crats — 60 Rs and 50 Ds — to watch a re­cord­ing of a re­cent de­bate between Obama and Re­pub­lic­an nom­in­ee John Mc­Cain . Be­fore they viewed the de­bate , however , one group of par­ti­cipants was giv­en a list of non­polit­ic­al val­ues such as “ so­cial skills ” and “ cre­ativ­ity , ” and then asked to write briefly about an in­stance when their own be­ha­vi­or had em­bod­ied one of those val­ues . ( The oth­er group also wrote about non­polit­ic­al val­ues , but they were asked to write about how those might be im­port­ant to oth­er people , not about their per­son­al ex­per­i­ences . )
By hav­ing one group write about non­polit­ic­al ex­per­i­ences , Bin­ning wanted to get par­ti­cipants think­ing of them­selves as in­di­vidu­als rather than par­tis­ans . The idea was that af­firm­ing the hu­man iden­tity would make people would feel more re­cept­ive to ideas that didn ’ t align with their world­view .
It worked . When Bin­ning asked the par­ti­cipants to judge the can­did­ates ’ per­form­ances , mem­bers of that group were more likely than those in the oth­er to give a fa­vor­able rat­ing to the op­pos­i­tion can­did­ate .
“ It ’ s not like all of a sud­den I say , ‘ Well , yeah , Mc­Cain ac­tu­ally won the de­bate , ’ ” he ex­plains , “ but we might say , ‘ Well , yeah , Obama , I think he did have some good points , but Mc­Cain may have had some oth­er good points as well . I don ’ t need to just blindly em­brace Obama. ’ “
Which seems like the ideal way to con­verse about polit­ics , right ? And it wasn ’ t a one-time ef­fect . Ten days after the elec­tion , Bin­ning asked the Re­pub­lic­ans in the group what type of pres­id­ent they thought Obama would be . Those who had been part of the group that wrote per­son­ally about non­polit­ic­al val­ues be­fore watch­ing the de­bate were sig­ni­fic­antly more op­tim­ist­ic about the Obama pres­id­ency .
So how might we per­suade people to set aside their blind par­tis­an­ship in oth­er con­texts ? Let ’ s start with a for­um in which the stakes are in­fin­itely lower than at the Middle East peace talks but where the par­tis­an vit­ri­ol runs every bit as high : In­ter­net com­ment sec­tions .
Com­ment sec­tions bring out the worst in par­tis­an think­ing : ad hom­inem at­tacks , people who clearly will not be con­vinced of the oth­er side , and stub­born ar­gu­ments where users talk past one an­oth­er , not with each oth­er . But maybe the struc­ture of com­ment sec­tions , rather than the people do­ing the com­ment­ing , has turned them in­to such in­tel­lec­tu­al sew­ers — and maybe a tweak or two at the mar­gins could clean them up .
“ You can think of com­ment sec­tions as mini-in­sti­tu­tions , ” Nyhan says . “ It ’ s a con­text in which de­bate is hap­pen­ing , and if we can help people be more civil to­ward each oth­er , that might be a pos­it­ive step . ”
Talia Stroud is try­ing to take that step . As the dir­ect­or of the En­ga­ging News pro­ject at the Uni­versity of Texas ( Aus­tin ) , she leads a re­search group with the goal of mak­ing the In­ter­net more civil for polit­ics . “ It ’ s un­be­liev­ably dif­fi­cult , ” she says .
One way to start , her re­search sug­gests , is to ree­valu­ate the “ like ” but­ton , a com­mon fea­ture on com­ment threads . In the con­text of a polit­ic­al-news art­icle , “ lik­ing ” a com­ment or a post could ac­tiv­ate us-versus-them think­ing . “ Lik­ing ” something means you as­so­ci­ate with it . It re­minds people of their par­tis­an­ship . “ So we did a study where we ma­nip­u­lated wheth­er it was a ‘ like ’ but­ton or a ‘ re­spect ’ but­ton , ” Stroud says . She found that people were more will­ing to ex­press “ re­spect ” for ar­gu­ments that ran counter to their own .
It ’ s “ not ‘ I like what you ’ re say­ing ’ but ‘ I re­spect it ’ even though I might not agree with you , ” she says . “ That showed some of the power of really small things and changes that could be eas­ily im­ple­men­ted . ”
A MONTH OF SPEAK­ING TO sci­ent­ists about the polit­ic­al brain pro­duced no short­age of de­press­ing con­clu­sions . Their re­search re­veals our brains to be frus­trat­ingly in­ept at ra­tion­al , ob­ject­ive polit­ic­al dis­course . And those rev­el­a­tions come at a time when elec­ted of­fi­cials have strong in­cent­ives to stay the par­tis­an course , and when the people who elect those of­fi­cials are in­creas­ingly get­ting their polit­ic­al news through sources pre-tailored to re­in­force their opin­ions .
A scan of the au­thor ’ s brain . ( Reena Flores ) But the re­search is more than just an­oth­er ex­plan­a­tion for our cur­rent par­tis­an mor­ass . On bal­ance , it of­fers a bet­ter case for op­tim­ism — about Con­gress , about voters , about your out­spoken ex­trem­ist uncle at Thanks­giv­ing , and about the power of reas­on in demo­cracy . Be­cause the re­search is also re­veal­ing that our brains , while im­per­fect , are sur­pris­ingly flex­ible , and that they can be nudged in a bet­ter dir­ec­tion . Yes , we wall ourselves off from un­ap­peal­ing truths . But when mo­tiv­ated — by money , by the right en­vir­on­ment , by an af­firmed sense of self , by in­sti­tu­tions that value truth and ci­vil­ity — those walls come down .
Out­side of the labor­at­ory , people are put­ting that re­search in­to prac­tice , de­vel­op­ing civic for­ums with our men­tal short­com­ings in mind .
After a dis­pute over a coal plant di­vided Tal­l­a­hassee , Flor­ida , in­to furi­ously par­tis­an camps , Al­lan Katz , then a city com­mis­sion­er , de­cided he had enough . “ It was very nasty , it was very con­ten­tious , it was very per­son­al , ” Katz re­calls of the 2006 de­bates . “ Facts didn ’ t mat­ter . ”
Katz , who is also a former U.S. am­bas­sad­or to Por­tugal , joined with oth­er com­munity mem­bers to cre­ate the Vil­lage Square , which hosts events where the pub­lic is in­vited to dis­cuss on­go­ing is­sues with ex­perts and act­iv­ists . In­ci­vil­ity and non-truths are not tol­er­ated . Dur­ing de­bates , the Vil­lage Square em­ploys fact check­ers to keep people in line . “ So people couldn ’ t make s—t up , ” Katz says . There ’ s also a ci­vil­ity bell : If people start yelling , the bell is rung to re­mind them of their bet­ter nature .
For the first meet­ing , 175 people showed up . Now the Vil­lage Square is run­ning 20 pro­grams a year in Tal­l­a­hassee , and it has ex­pan­ded in­to St. Peters­burg , Kan­sas City , and Sac­ra­mento . In Tal­l­a­hassee , city of­fi­cials ask the Vil­lage Square to host pub­lic for­ums on di­vis­ive is­sues .
When people con­sider them­selves to be part of the same team , they do a much bet­ter job of drop­ping their com­bat­ive stance and pro­cessing the world through a less par­tis­an lens .
“ You ’ re not try­ing to turn lib­er­als in­to con­ser­vat­ives or vice versa , ” Katz says . “ But the only way to get people to see the oth­er point of view , even if they don ’ t agree with it , is to do it in per­son . ”
Katz and his fel­low or­gan­izers are re­ly­ing on people find­ing a com­mon hu­man­ity , and in so do­ing , he is play­ing to one of the brain ’ s great strengths : The same tri­bal cog­nit­ive pro­cesses that make it easy to turn people against one an­oth­er can also be har­nessed to bring them to­geth­er .
When people con­sider them­selves to be part of the same team , be it as Vil­lage Square par­ti­cipants , as fel­low Amer­ic­ans , or even — one might dream — as fel­low mem­bers of Con­gress , they do a much bet­ter job of drop­ping their com­bat­ive stance and pro­cessing the world through a less par­tis­an lens .
And we make those iden­tity jumps all the time , as our brains are wired to let us do .
Some­times , in the middle of his red team/blue team ex­er­cise , Van Bavel will switch a par­ti­cipant from one group to the oth­er . “ We say , ‘ Listen , there ’ s been a mis­take , you ’ re ac­tu­ally on the oth­er team , ’ ” he says . “ And the mo­ment we do , we com­pletely re­verse their em­pathy . Sud­denly , they care about every­body who is in their new in-group . ”","I’m ly­ing in the met­al coffin of an MRI ma­chine, listen­ing to what sounds like jack­ham­mers and smelling my own breath go stale. My head is se­cured in place. I have a pan­ic but­ton. I won’t press it, but I do grip it tightly. Above me, faces flash on a screen.

Some are hu­man, oth­ers are dolls, and some are di­git­ally blen­ded to be something in between. It’s my job to fig­ure out which are which. And as I do, re­search­ers at New York Uni­versity’s brain-ima­ging cen­ter are track­ing what goes on in my head.

I’m not sick, and we’re not here to test my calm in the face of claus­tro­pho­bia. In­stead, I’m a sub­ject for re­search on a big­ger ques­tion: Is the hu­man polit­ic­al brain broken?

The NYU team is try­ing to show that our brains are hard­wired for par­tis­an­ship and how that skews our per­cep­tions in pub­lic life. Re­search at NYU and else­where is un­der­scor­ing just how blind the “us-versus-them” mind-set can make people when they try to pro­cess new polit­ic­al in­form­a­tion. Once this par­tis­an­ship men­tal­ity kicks in, the brain al­most auto­mat­ic­ally pre-fil­ters facts — even non­con­tro­ver­sial ones — that of­fend our polit­ic­al sens­ib­il­it­ies.

“Once you trip this wire, this trig­ger, this cue, that you are a part of ‘us-versus-them,’ it’s al­most like the whole brain be­comes re-co­ordin­ated in how it views people,” says Jay Van Bavel, the lead­er of NYU’s So­cial Per­cep­tion and Eval­u­ation Lab.

Our tend­ency to­ward par­tis­an­ship is likely the res­ult of evol­u­tion — form­ing groups is how pre­his­tor­ic hu­mans sur­vived. That’s help­ful when try­ing to mas­ter an un­for­giv­ing en­vir­on­ment with Stone Age tech­no­logy. It’s less so when try­ing to foster a func­tion­al demo­cracy.

Un­der­stand­ing the oth­er side’s point of view, even if one dis­agrees with it, is cent­ral to com­prom­ise, poli­cy­mak­ing, and any hope for ci­vil­ity in civic life. So if our brains are blind­ing us to in­form­a­tion that chal­lenges our par­tis­an pre­dis­pos­i­tion, how can we hope ever to find com­mon ground? It’s a chal­lenge that is stump­ing both the elect­or­ate and the elec­ted of­fi­cials who rep­res­ent them. Con­gres­sion­al hear­ings are hear­ings in name only — op­por­tun­it­ies for politi­cians to grand­stand rather than talk with each oth­er. And the polit­ic­al dis­cus­sion, even among those well versed in the is­sues, largely ex­ists in par­al­lel red and blue uni­verses, men­tal spheres with few or no com­mon facts to serve as start­ing points.

But rather than des­pair, many polit­ic­al-psy­cho­logy re­search­ers see their res­ults as reas­on for hope, and they raise a tan­tal­iz­ing pro­spect: With enough un­der­stand­ing of what ex­actly makes us so vul­ner­able to par­tis­an­ship, can we re­shape our polit­ic­al en­vir­on­ment to ac­cess the bet­ter an­gels of our neur­o­lo­gic­al nature?

WHAT DOES ANY OF this have to do with pho­tos of dolls? The re­search­ers are test­ing one of par­tis­an­ship’s more fright­en­ing fea­tures: It al­lows us, even pushes us, to de­hu­man­ize those we cat­egor­ize as “them.”

I’m tasked with dis­tin­guish­ing hu­mans from non­hu­mans, and it’s not as easy as it sounds. While some of the faces ap­pear to be nor­mal pho­to­graphs of men and wo­men, oth­ers are warped in­to something that would have scared me as a child — faces that look like masks. They have no creases in their pla­sticky skin, and their big, anime-style eyes shine death stares. They are dis­tinctly non­hu­man. It’s the ones in between that pose the prob­lem, however. A face that’s 90 per­cent hu­man and 10 per­cent doll is plainly seen as hu­man. But when the face is 50 per­cent doll and 50 per­cent hu­man, that’s where par­tis­an per­spect­ive takes over.

Re­search­ers test par­tis­an­ship by ask­ing par­ti­cipants to dis­tin­guish hu­man from non­hu­man faces. (Journ­al of Ex­per­i­ment­al So­cial Psy­cho­logy 52 (2014) 15”“23/Hack­el et al., JESP, 2014)For the first tri­al I am just shown a set of faces, but for the next run, Van Bavel in­tro­duces a twist: The faces are di­vided in­to two groups. Be­fore I see the first group, the Amer­ic­an flag flashes, and I’m told I’m look­ing at my coun­try­men. Be­fore the second, a Rus­si­an flag ap­pears. These are faces of Rus­si­ans.

As I try to as­sess which faces have a soul be­hind them, a dark fa­cet of par­tis­an psy­cho­logy sur­faces. If the face be­longs to a team mem­ber — in my case, an Amer­ic­an — I’m more likely to as­sign them hu­man­ity. I’m less in­clined to do the same for Rus­si­ans.

It’s not en­tirely my fault — or, at least, not the fault of any con­scious de­cisions. In­stead, it’s just my brain pro­cess fol­low­ing a well-worn pat­tern. When Van Bavel looks at the brain scans of people in his doll­house ex­per­i­ment, he finds that the brain re­gions used to em­path­ize with oth­ers aren’t as act­ive when a per­son is eval­u­at­ing faces he or she has been told be­long to the oth­er team.

HU­MANS’ WILL­ING­NESS TO de­hu­man­ize is of­ten men­tioned along­side some of the darkest chapters of his­tory — the Holo­caust, gen­o­cide in Rwanda, the Kh­mer Rouge — when re­gimes went to great lengths to build an­ger against “the oth­er.” In my case, the ex­per­i­ment re­lies on a na­tion­al iden­tity re­in­forced since birth.

But to cre­ate the base “us and them” struc­ture, none of that is needed. The brain is so hard­wired to build such groups that Van Bavel says he can turn any­one on the street in­to a par­tis­an. “I can do it in five minutes with a ran­dom stranger,” he says. All it takes is a coin flip.

“Some­body comes in­to your lab and you tell them, ‘You’re part of the blue team,’ ” he ex­plains. “The next per­son who comes in, you flip a coin, let’s say it comes up the oth­er way. And you say, ‘You’re on the red team.’ “

That’s it. The team­mates nev­er have to meet. Or in­ter­act. There doesn’t need to be any­thing at stake. But with­in minutes, these in­sta-par­tis­ans like their team­mates bet­ter than they like the oth­er guys. And it shows when Van Bavel puts his sub­jects through his MRI doll­house.

Red-team mem­bers are more likely to see hu­mans when they’re told they’re look­ing at fel­low red-team faces. Blue-team mem­bers re­spond the same way. Oth­er tests re­veal that red-team mem­bers re­mem­ber red-team faces more ac­cur­ately, and if Van Bavel asks sub­jects to al­loc­ate money, red-team mem­bers will pay out more to their own. Team mem­bers also have less sym­pathy for those on the oth­er side, and even ex­per­i­ence pleas­ure while read­ing about their pain.

I’m not just in­side the MRI to be stumped by Rus­si­an dolls. The re­search­ers are also check­ing to see if my brain has a con­ser­vat­ive or lib­er­al shape.

The au­thor be­ing loaded in­to an MRI ma­chine. (Reena Flores)In 2011, a team of Brit­ish sci­ent­ists pub­lished a pa­per that found that brain struc­tures cor­rel­ated with polit­ic­al ori­ent­a­tion. Spe­cific­ally, con­ser­vat­ives ten­ded to have lar­ger amy­g­dala areas — brain mat­ter that plays a role in fear con­di­tion­ing — than lib­er­als. The res­ults ad­ded to a body of re­search that finds con­ser­vat­ives and lib­er­als have dif­fer­ent physiolo­gic­al re­sponses to the en­vir­on­ment, and even per­ceive the world dif­fer­ently.

At NYU, they’re test­ing that con­clu­sion, and the mag­nets around me are meas­ur­ing the volume of my amy­g­dala. Be­fore my MRI, I took a test aimed at giv­ing me a score on the re­search­ers’ “sys­tem-jus­ti­fic­a­tion scale,” a meas­ure that cor­rel­ates with one com­pon­ent of where a per­son falls on the lib­er­al-to-con­ser­vat­ive spec­trum. People who score high on sys­tem jus­ti­fic­a­tion tend to be pat­ri­ot­ic and de­fend­ers of the status quo. Those who score low tend to be the rebels. So far, with 100 par­ti­cipants, Van Bavel’s group is find­ing mean­ing­ful dif­fer­ences between the brains of high sys­tem-jus­ti­fi­ers and low sys­tem-jus­ti­fi­ers.

Do You Have a Rebel’s Brain? Quiz

(Col­leagues joked that I might want to keep my test res­ults to my­self if I wanted to con­tin­ue work­ing as a non­par­tis­an journ­al­ist in Wash­ing­ton. But — for the re­cord — I’m a lab-cer­ti­fied mod­er­ate: “Yeah, you were right in the heart of the dis­tri­bu­tion, not only in the terms of your sys­tem-jus­ti­fic­a­tion tend­en­cies but also your amy­g­dala volume is very healthy,” Van Bavel tells me the day after, laugh­ing.)

BUT WHEN IT COMES to Amer­ic­an polit­ics, how troubled should we be by any of these find­ings? Amer­ica’s par­tis­an di­vide is as old as Amer­ica’s demo­cracy. And it’s neither feas­ible nor de­sir­able to hope for a na­tion­al con­sensus on every is­sue. Even if we all worked from the same set of facts, and even if we all un­der­stood those facts per­fectly, dif­fer­ences of opin­ion would — and should — re­main. Those opin­ions are not the prob­lem. The trouble is when we’re so blinded by our par­tis­an­ship that it over­rides reas­on — and re­search sug­gests that is hap­pen­ing all the time.

With just a hint of par­tis­an prim­ing, an Ari­zona State Uni­versity re­search­er was able to in­stantly blind Demo­crats to a non­con­tro­ver­sial fact, lead­ing them im­me­di­ately to fail to solve the easi­est of math prob­lems. In the 2010 ex­per­i­ment, polit­ic­al sci­ent­ist Mark Ramirez asked sub­jects two sim­il­ar ques­tions. The con­trol group saw this ques­tion: “Would you say that com­pared to 2008, the level of un­em­ploy­ment in this coun­try has got­ten bet­ter, stayed the same, or got­ten worse?” A sep­ar­ate group saw this one: “Would you say that the level of un­em­ploy­ment in this coun­try has got­ten bet­ter, stayed the same, or got­ten worse since Barack Obama was elec­ted Pres­id­ent?”

The key dif­fer­ence between the two: the first men­tions the time peri­od for as­sess­ing un­em­ploy­ment, while the second frames the is­sue around Pres­id­ent Obama. When asked the first ques­tion, Demo­crats and Re­pub­lic­ans re­spon­ded sim­il­arly, with most say­ing un­em­ploy­ment had re­mained about the same. But among sub­jects who got the second ques­tion, opin­ions shif­ted along par­tis­an lines: Around 60 per­cent of Demo­crats said un­em­ploy­ment had got­ten bet­ter or some­what bet­ter, and about 75 per­cent of Re­pub­lic­ans said the op­pos­ite.

In fact, the un­em­ploy­ment rate in­creased between Obama’s elec­tion and Ramirez’s study. One can ar­gue about wheth­er this is a fair frame for eval­u­at­ing this or any pres­id­ent’s eco­nom­ic re­cord, but from a raw-num­bers per­spect­ive, the rise in the un­em­ploy­ment rate between 2008 and 2010 is in­dis­put­able.

But even giv­ing Demo­crats that in­form­a­tion did not in­crease the ac­cur­acy of their re­sponses. Ramirez’s study asked some par­ti­cipants the fol­low­ing ques­tion: “The U.S. Bur­eau of Labor Stat­ist­ics shows un­em­ploy­ment has in­creased by 4.6 per­cent since 2008. Would you say that the level of un­em­ploy­ment in this coun­try has got­ten bet­ter, stayed the same, or got­ten worse since Barack Obama was elec­ted Pres­id­ent?”

Clearly, the an­swer is in the sen­tence that im­me­di­ately pre­cedes the ques­tion. But the men­tion of Obama launched a par­tis­an men­tal pro­cess that led many astray: Nearly 60 per­cent of Demo­crats said un­em­ploy­ment had lessened since Obama’s elec­tion.

Es­sen­tially, once Demo­crats fo­cused on Obama, most of them largely ig­nored the facts. (About 80 per­cent of Re­pub­lic­ans got the an­swer right when it was spoon-fed to them, but Re­pub­lic­ans temp­ted to cry vic­tory should be cau­tioned that re­search­ers have found them to be sim­il­arly off base in as­sess­ing the eco­nomy when one of their own is in the Oval Of­fice.)

Ramirez’s ex­per­i­ment also re­veals that our bi­ases don’t com­pletely blind us to in­form­a­tion, however. When he gave Demo­crats the cor­rect un­em­ploy­ment stat­ist­ics, it did not change their an­swers, but it did make them less con­fid­ent in those re­sponses, as re­por­ted in a post-test ques­tion­naire. “It tells me that people might ac­tu­ally be pro­cessing the in­form­a­tion in an un­biased way,” Ramirez says.

The ques­tion, then, is how to amp­li­fy that un­biased pro­cessing to over­come the par­tis­an blind­ness.

BRENDAN NYHAN KNOWS just how hard it is to move that men­tal needle.

“I had the dream of, if we give people the right in­form­a­tion, it’ll make a dif­fer­ence,” says Nyhan, a polit­ic­al sci­ent­ist at Dart­mouth and con­trib­ut­or to The New York Times‘s The Up­shot.

But after 15 years of throw­ing facts in people’s faces, Nyhan has found the mat­ter to be much more com­plic­ated. In the early 2000s, he cofoun­ded the fact-check­ing web­site Spin­san­ity to com­bat the “he said, she said” cov­er­age he saw in the me­dia. “I’m very proud of the work we did, but it did il­lus­trate how hard it was to change people’s minds, even among the se­lect group of people who were will­ing to take the time to read a non­par­tis­an fact-check­ing web­site,” Nyhan said.

More re­cently, Nyhan at­temp­ted to de­bunk an ar­gu­ment that is grow­ing in pop­ular­ity but ut­terly lack­ing in sci­entif­ic sup­port: that par­ents shouldn’t have their chil­dren vac­cin­ated.

Nyhan and his col­lab­or­at­ors wanted to con­vince par­ents who were against vac­cin­a­tions that their op­pos­i­tion was un­foun­ded. Work­ing with a large sample of 1,759 par­ents, the team sent them a vari­ety of ma­ter­i­al, in­clud­ing pamph­lets that ex­plained the lack of evid­ence link­ing vac­cin­a­tions with aut­ism, ex­plan­a­tions of the dangers of measles, pho­tos of sick chil­dren whose dis­eases could have been pre­ven­ted, and a story about an in­fant who al­most died from in­fec­tion. Some were ap­peals to pure reas­on; some were ap­peals to pure emo­tion.

Noth­ing worked. One of the in­ter­ven­tions — the pamph­let ex­plain­ing the lack of evid­ence — ac­tu­ally made anti-vac­cin­a­tion par­ents even less in­clined to vac­cin­ate. “Some of the con­clu­sions of that re­search people find pretty de­press­ing,” Nyhan says. “My­self in­cluded.”

In an­oth­er study, Nyhan wanted to see if he could find a real-world way to press ac­tu­al politi­cians to be bet­ter hand­lers of the facts. In the months lead­ing up to the 2012 elec­tion, Nyhan and coau­thor Jason Reifler per­formed an ex­per­i­ment on 1,169 un­wit­ting state le­gis­lat­ors. They wanted to see if fact checks could mo­tiv­ate the politi­cians to be more truth­ful. A third of the le­gis­lat­ors re­ceived a let­ter that con­tained a veiled threat. It read: “Politi­cians who lie put their repu­ta­tions and ca­reers at risk, but only when those lies are ex­posed.” The let­ter then re­minded the politi­cians that Poli­ti­Fact, a fact-check­ing group, op­er­ated in their state. The let­ter clearly im­plied, “Poli­ti­Fact will be watch­ing you.” An­oth­er third of the law­makers re­ceived a let­ter that ex­cluded ref­er­ences to fact check­ing. The last third re­ceived no let­ter.

Throughout the elec­tion cycle, Nyhan and Reifler logged the politi­cians’ Poli­ti­Fact rat­ings (from “true” to “pants on fire”). They also had a re­search as­sist­ant comb through the me­dia cov­er­age of each le­gis­lat­or, search­ing for crit­ic­al stor­ies. The res­ults, pending pub­lic­a­tion in the Amer­ic­an Journ­al of Polit­ic­al Sci­ence, were lim­ited but prom­ising. Over­all, only a very few le­gis­lat­ors — 27 out of 1,169 — were called out on lies. But of those 27, only five had re­ceived the threat­en­ing let­ter — less than a third. That’s reas­on enough to re­search the idea fur­ther. “This study was a first step,” Nyhan says.

One way to help people look past their in­nate par­tis­an­ship? Pay them to do it.

“Hu­man psy­cho­logy isn’t go­ing to change,” he says. “The factors that make people vul­ner­able to mis­in­form­a­tion aren’t go­ing to change. But the in­cent­ives fa­cing elites can change, and we can design in­sti­tu­tions that func­tion bet­ter or worse un­der po­lar­iz­a­tion and that do a bet­ter or worse job at provid­ing in­cent­ives to make ac­cur­ate state­ments.”

THERE’S AN EASI­ER WAY to help people look past their in­nate par­tis­an­ship: Pay them to do it.

A 2013 study out of Prin­ceton found that mon­et­ary in­cent­ives at­ten­u­ate the par­tis­an gap in an­swers to ques­tions about the eco­nomy. The re­search­ers de­signed an ex­per­i­ment sim­il­ar to Ramirez’s un­em­ploy­ment study but with a modi­fic­a­tion: Some par­ti­cipants were plainly in­formed, “We will pay you for an­swer­ing cor­rectly.” All it took was $1 or $2 to dra­mat­ic­ally im­prove the chances of a right an­swer, cut­ting the par­tis­an gap between Re­pub­lic­ans and Demo­crats in half — half!

Of course, a mass “pay Amer­ic­ans to pay more at­ten­tion to facts” cam­paign isn’t hap­pen­ing. So the ques­tion, then, is how do we get people to be more ob­ject­ive, without throw­ing money at them?

Jimmy Carter dis­covered one an­swer dur­ing the 1978 peace ne­go­ti­ations between Egyp­tian Pres­id­ent An­war Sad­at and Is­raeli Prime Min­is­ter Men­a­chem Be­gin. The talks were on the brink of col­lapsing in their fi­nal hours, and the prime min­is­ter was pre­pared to walk. That’s when Carter dir­ec­ted his sec­ret­ary to find out all the names of Be­gin’s grand­chil­dren. Carter auto­graphed pho­tos for them and per­son­ally gave them to the Is­raeli lead­er. “He had taken a blood oath that he would nev­er dis­mantle an Is­raeli set­tle­ment,” Carter later re­called in an in­ter­view. “He looked at those eight pho­to­graphs and tears began to run down his cheeks — and mine — as he read the names.”

A few minutes later, Be­gin was back at the ne­go­ti­at­ing table. By ap­peal­ing to a non­polit­ic­al idea Be­gin cared about — his fam­ily — Carter was able to bring him to a place where he could bend.

In 1978, Jimmy Carter’s ap­peal to Is­raeli Prime Min­is­ter Men­a­chem Be­gin’s sense of fam­ily kept Be­gin at the ne­go­ti­at­ing table with Egyp­tian Pres­id­ent An­war Sad­at. (AP Photo/Bob Daugh­erty)The tech­nique works even when world peace isn’t on the line. Kev­in Bin­ning, a Uni­versity of Pitt­s­burgh psy­cho­lo­gist, used it to re­shape the way par­tis­ans re­acted to a 2008 pres­id­en­tial de­bate.

Just two days be­fore the elec­tion, Bin­ning as­sembled 110 self-iden­ti­fied Re­pub­lic­ans and Demo­crats — 60 Rs and 50 Ds — to watch a re­cord­ing of a re­cent de­bate between Obama and Re­pub­lic­an nom­in­ee John Mc­Cain. Be­fore they viewed the de­bate, however, one group of par­ti­cipants was giv­en a list of non­polit­ic­al val­ues such as “so­cial skills” and “cre­ativ­ity,” and then asked to write briefly about an in­stance when their own be­ha­vi­or had em­bod­ied one of those val­ues. (The oth­er group also wrote about non­polit­ic­al val­ues, but they were asked to write about how those might be im­port­ant to oth­er people, not about their per­son­al ex­per­i­ences.)

By hav­ing one group write about non­polit­ic­al ex­per­i­ences, Bin­ning wanted to get par­ti­cipants think­ing of them­selves as in­di­vidu­als rather than par­tis­ans. The idea was that af­firm­ing the hu­man iden­tity would make people would feel more re­cept­ive to ideas that didn’t align with their world­view.

It worked. When Bin­ning asked the par­ti­cipants to judge the can­did­ates’ per­form­ances, mem­bers of that group were more likely than those in the oth­er to give a fa­vor­able rat­ing to the op­pos­i­tion can­did­ate.

“It’s not like all of a sud­den I say, ‘Well, yeah, Mc­Cain ac­tu­ally won the de­bate,’ ” he ex­plains, “but we might say, ‘Well, yeah, Obama, I think he did have some good points, but Mc­Cain may have had some oth­er good points as well. I don’t need to just blindly em­brace Obama.’ “

Which seems like the ideal way to con­verse about polit­ics, right? And it wasn’t a one-time ef­fect. Ten days after the elec­tion, Bin­ning asked the Re­pub­lic­ans in the group what type of pres­id­ent they thought Obama would be. Those who had been part of the group that wrote per­son­ally about non­polit­ic­al val­ues be­fore watch­ing the de­bate were sig­ni­fic­antly more op­tim­ist­ic about the Obama pres­id­ency.

So how might we per­suade people to set aside their blind par­tis­an­ship in oth­er con­texts? Let’s start with a for­um in which the stakes are in­fin­itely lower than at the Middle East peace talks but where the par­tis­an vit­ri­ol runs every bit as high: In­ter­net com­ment sec­tions.

Com­ment sec­tions bring out the worst in par­tis­an think­ing: ad hom­inem at­tacks, people who clearly will not be con­vinced of the oth­er side, and stub­born ar­gu­ments where users talk past one an­oth­er, not with each oth­er. But maybe the struc­ture of com­ment sec­tions, rather than the people do­ing the com­ment­ing, has turned them in­to such in­tel­lec­tu­al sew­ers — and maybe a tweak or two at the mar­gins could clean them up.

“You can think of com­ment sec­tions as mini-in­sti­tu­tions,” Nyhan says. “It’s a con­text in which de­bate is hap­pen­ing, and if we can help people be more civil to­ward each oth­er, that might be a pos­it­ive step.”

Talia Stroud is try­ing to take that step. As the dir­ect­or of the En­ga­ging News pro­ject at the Uni­versity of Texas (Aus­tin), she leads a re­search group with the goal of mak­ing the In­ter­net more civil for polit­ics. “It’s un­be­liev­ably dif­fi­cult,” she says.

One way to start, her re­search sug­gests, is to ree­valu­ate the “like” but­ton, a com­mon fea­ture on com­ment threads. In the con­text of a polit­ic­al-news art­icle, “lik­ing” a com­ment or a post could ac­tiv­ate us-versus-them think­ing. “Lik­ing” something means you as­so­ci­ate with it. It re­minds people of their par­tis­an­ship. “So we did a study where we ma­nip­u­lated wheth­er it was a ‘like’ but­ton or a ‘re­spect’ but­ton,” Stroud says. She found that people were more will­ing to ex­press “re­spect” for ar­gu­ments that ran counter to their own.

It’s “not ‘I like what you’re say­ing’ but ‘I re­spect it’ even though I might not agree with you,” she says. “That showed some of the power of really small things and changes that could be eas­ily im­ple­men­ted.”

A MONTH OF SPEAK­ING TO sci­ent­ists about the polit­ic­al brain pro­duced no short­age of de­press­ing con­clu­sions. Their re­search re­veals our brains to be frus­trat­ingly in­ept at ra­tion­al, ob­ject­ive polit­ic­al dis­course. And those rev­el­a­tions come at a time when elec­ted of­fi­cials have strong in­cent­ives to stay the par­tis­an course, and when the people who elect those of­fi­cials are in­creas­ingly get­ting their polit­ic­al news through sources pre-tailored to re­in­force their opin­ions.

A scan of the au­thor’s brain. (Reena Flores)But the re­search is more than just an­oth­er ex­plan­a­tion for our cur­rent par­tis­an mor­ass. On bal­ance, it of­fers a bet­ter case for op­tim­ism — about Con­gress, about voters, about your out­spoken ex­trem­ist uncle at Thanks­giv­ing, and about the power of reas­on in demo­cracy. Be­cause the re­search is also re­veal­ing that our brains, while im­per­fect, are sur­pris­ingly flex­ible, and that they can be nudged in a bet­ter dir­ec­tion. Yes, we wall ourselves off from un­ap­peal­ing truths. But when mo­tiv­ated — by money, by the right en­vir­on­ment, by an af­firmed sense of self, by in­sti­tu­tions that value truth and ci­vil­ity — those walls come down.

Out­side of the labor­at­ory, people are put­ting that re­search in­to prac­tice, de­vel­op­ing civic for­ums with our men­tal short­com­ings in mind.

After a dis­pute over a coal plant di­vided Tal­l­a­hassee, Flor­ida, in­to furi­ously par­tis­an camps, Al­lan Katz, then a city com­mis­sion­er, de­cided he had enough. “It was very nasty, it was very con­ten­tious, it was very per­son­al,” Katz re­calls of the 2006 de­bates. “Facts didn’t mat­ter.”

Katz, who is also a former U.S. am­bas­sad­or to Por­tugal, joined with oth­er com­munity mem­bers to cre­ate the Vil­lage Square, which hosts events where the pub­lic is in­vited to dis­cuss on­go­ing is­sues with ex­perts and act­iv­ists. In­ci­vil­ity and non-truths are not tol­er­ated. Dur­ing de­bates, the Vil­lage Square em­ploys fact check­ers to keep people in line. “So people couldn’t make s—t up,” Katz says. There’s also a ci­vil­ity bell: If people start yelling, the bell is rung to re­mind them of their bet­ter nature.

For the first meet­ing, 175 people showed up. Now the Vil­lage Square is run­ning 20 pro­grams a year in Tal­l­a­hassee, and it has ex­pan­ded in­to St. Peters­burg, Kan­sas City, and Sac­ra­mento. In Tal­l­a­hassee, city of­fi­cials ask the Vil­lage Square to host pub­lic for­ums on di­vis­ive is­sues.

When people con­sider them­selves to be part of the same team, they do a much bet­ter job of drop­ping their com­bat­ive stance and pro­cessing the world through a less par­tis­an lens.

“You’re not try­ing to turn lib­er­als in­to con­ser­vat­ives or vice versa,” Katz says. “But the only way to get people to see the oth­er point of view, even if they don’t agree with it, is to do it in per­son.”

Katz and his fel­low or­gan­izers are re­ly­ing on people find­ing a com­mon hu­man­ity, and in so do­ing, he is play­ing to one of the brain’s great strengths: The same tri­bal cog­nit­ive pro­cesses that make it easy to turn people against one an­oth­er can also be har­nessed to bring them to­geth­er.

When people con­sider them­selves to be part of the same team, be it as Vil­lage Square par­ti­cipants, as fel­low Amer­ic­ans, or even — one might dream — as fel­low mem­bers of Con­gress, they do a much bet­ter job of drop­ping their com­bat­ive stance and pro­cessing the world through a less par­tis­an lens.

And we make those iden­tity jumps all the time, as our brains are wired to let us do.

Some­times, in the middle of his red team/blue team ex­er­cise, Van Bavel will switch a par­ti­cipant from one group to the oth­er. “We say, ‘Listen, there’s been a mis­take, you’re ac­tu­ally on the oth­er team,’ ” he says. “And the mo­ment we do, we com­pletely re­verse their em­pathy. Sud­denly, they care about every­body who is in their new in-group.”",www.nationaljournal.com,center,xK9mIKkscGn67bHL

polarization,Guest Writer - Right,2,http://reason.com/archives/2017/06/02/there-is-no-political-tribe-that-deserve,There Is No Political Tribe That Deserves Your Complete Loyalty,2017-06-02,"David Harsanyi, Josh Blackman, Elizabeth Nolan Brown, Charles Oliver, John Stossel, Jacob Sullum, Eric Boehm, Shikha Dalmia","If you ever wanted to understand the power of tribal loyalty , there are two new articles for you to read . The first is a Daily Beast article that explores the reinvention of Maxine Waters , a congresswoman `` once dubbed one of the nation 's 'most corrupt ' '' in Washington , D.C . The second is a column titled `` Why Conservatives Still Attack Trump '' in which columnist and radio talk-show host Dennis Prager attempts to figure out why so many Republicans refuse to walk lockstep with President Trump .
Let 's start with Waters , who is , of course , still corrupt—a dictator-loving conspiracy theorist who has abused her office for decades . She is now the recipient of standing ovations for her sharp attacks on Trump . The esteem Waters receives not only exposes the hypocrisy of many who claim to resist Trump on constitutional and ethical grounds but also warns against aligning yourself with people who do n't respect the norms they claim to protect .
Those who advocate overturning the Citizens United ruling and allowing the state to ban political speech—almost every liberal—have little business lecturing about free expression . Neither do those who , only a few months ago , proposed ditching Fifth Amendment protections in an effort to confiscate guns . Nor do those whose opposition to spying on American citizens is contingent on which president is in office . The notion that Sen. Chris Murphy ( D-Conn. ) or Rep. Adam Schiff ( D-Calif. ) are guardians of the Constitution is laughable .
Obligatory post-election anti-Trumpism , which dictates absolute opposition to what this one person is doing , puts you in league with people whose concern has little to do with the Constitution and everything to do with their ideology . `` Never Trump '' was once a statement of intent . Now it 's often a demand for conservatives to engage in hysterics every time the word `` Russia '' appears . No , thanks .
A good example is the Paris Agreement . `` We ca n't let Pres @ BarackObama 's global effort to reduce carbon pollution with the # ParisAgreement be undone in one fell swoop , '' Sen. Chuck Schumer ( D-N.Y. ) tweeted recently . According to Democrats , the agreement is the most crucial international deal the world has ever known yet not important enough to be subjected to the traditional checks and balances of American governance .
When the next liberal president is elected , he or she will use the Environmental Protection Agency to bypass Congress and , by fiat , regulate carbon dioxide—a chemical compound that permeates everything—without any consideration for the cost or the electorate . In other words , they 'll do it in the same way Democrats bypass the process when making immigration policy or social policy or any policy they do n't have the votes to enact .
In 2014 , Harvard Law professor Laurence Tribe—now also a hero of the resistance—reminded us that this kind of governance is what former Associate Justice Robert Jackson warned about when he spoke to `` the balanced power structure of our Republic . '' Rest assured , no one at The New York Times will lament the corrosion of process or executive abuse when that day comes .
By withdrawing from the Paris Agreement , however , Trump is strengthening the balance of power in this country . No , I 'm not under the impression he would do so out of some deep reverence for the sanctity of the Constitution . No standing ovations from me . But it is what it is .
`` We are not so different , you and I , '' Prager might say to Democrats . His position , after all , is AlwaysTrump , a demand to ignore every scandal and fumble for the greater good . In his column , Prager asks Republicans to `` please report for duty . '' He says : `` I have concluded that there are a few reasons that explain conservatives who were Never-Trumpers during the election , and who remain anti-Trump today . The first and , by far , the greatest reason is this : They do not believe that America is engaged in a civil war , with the survival of America as we know it at stake . ''
If the survival of the United States hinges on the competence of the Trump administration , then the civil war is lost , I 'm afraid . If , however , it hinges on a set of ideals and laws—which is what I have always understood Prager 's position to be—then there is no obligation to follow any man , and certainly not a man with malleable principles . And I 'm sure if Trump were sending pallets of cash to Iran , Prager would n't be insisting on this level of support for him , even if his tax plan were better than President Reagan 's .
Prager circumvents this problem by claiming that the president has acted in a wholly conservative manner . Yet Trump 's recklessness and temperament certainly are n't conservative , nor are many of his ideas . But setting that aside for a moment , if the case against President Obama was predicated not only on his policies but on the way he abused the mechanisms of power , then , surely , Trump deserves criticism as well .
And if a person is truly apprehensive about creeping `` authoritarianism '' —these days , the prevailing concern of the same Democrats who push policies that almost exclusively coerce Americans economically—rigid group thinking just is n't feasible anymore . Anti , anti-anti , pro , whatever . The sad truth is that there are simply too many people acting reprehensibly in Washington for many Americans to be a member of any of these tribes .","If you ever wanted to understand the power of tribal loyalty, there are two new articles for you to read.

The second is a column titled ""Why Conservatives Still Attack Trump"" in which columnist and radio talk-show host Dennis Prager attempts to figure out why so many Republicans refuse to walk lockstep with President Trump.

Let's start with Waters, who is, of course, still corrupt—a dictator-loving conspiracy theorist who has abused her office for decades. She is now the recipient of standing ovations for her sharp attacks on Trump. The esteem Waters receives not only exposes the hypocrisy of many who claim to resist Trump on constitutional and ethical grounds but also warns against aligning yourself with people who don't respect the norms they claim to protect.

Those who advocate overturning the Citizens United ruling and allowing the state to ban political speech—almost every liberal—have little business lecturing about free expression. Neither do those who, only a few months ago, proposed ditching Fifth Amendment protections in an effort to confiscate guns. Nor do those whose opposition to spying on American citizens is contingent on which president is in office. The notion that Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) or Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) are guardians of the Constitution is laughable.

Obligatory post-election anti-Trumpism, which dictates absolute opposition to what this one person is doing, puts you in league with people whose concern has little to do with the Constitution and everything to do with their ideology. ""Never Trump"" was once a statement of intent. Now it's often a demand for conservatives to engage in hysterics every time the word ""Russia"" appears. No, thanks.

A good example is the Paris Agreement. ""We can't let Pres @BarackObama's global effort to reduce carbon pollution with the #ParisAgreement be undone in one fell swoop,"" Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) tweeted recently. According to Democrats, the agreement is the most crucial international deal the world has ever known yet not important enough to be subjected to the traditional checks and balances of American governance.

When the next liberal president is elected, he or she will use the Environmental Protection Agency to bypass Congress and, by fiat, regulate carbon dioxide—a chemical compound that permeates everything—without any consideration for the cost or the electorate. In other words, they'll do it in the same way Democrats bypass the process when making immigration policy or social policy or any policy they don't have the votes to enact.

In 2014, Harvard Law professor Laurence Tribe—now also a hero of the resistance—reminded us that this kind of governance is what former Associate Justice Robert Jackson warned about when he spoke to ""the balanced power structure of our Republic."" Rest assured, no one at The New York Times will lament the corrosion of process or executive abuse when that day comes.

By withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, however, Trump is strengthening the balance of power in this country. No, I'm not under the impression he would do so out of some deep reverence for the sanctity of the Constitution. No standing ovations from me. But it is what it is.

""We are not so different, you and I,"" Prager might say to Democrats. His position, after all, is AlwaysTrump, a demand to ignore every scandal and fumble for the greater good. In his column, Prager asks Republicans to ""please report for duty."" He says: ""I have concluded that there are a few reasons that explain conservatives who were Never-Trumpers during the election, and who remain anti-Trump today. The first and, by far, the greatest reason is this: They do not believe that America is engaged in a civil war, with the survival of America as we know it at stake.""

If the survival of the United States hinges on the competence of the Trump administration, then the civil war is lost, I'm afraid. If, however, it hinges on a set of ideals and laws—which is what I have always understood Prager's position to be—then there is no obligation to follow any man, and certainly not a man with malleable principles. And I'm sure if Trump were sending pallets of cash to Iran, Prager wouldn't be insisting on this level of support for him, even if his tax plan were better than President Reagan's.

Prager circumvents this problem by claiming that the president has acted in a wholly conservative manner. Yet Trump's recklessness and temperament certainly aren't conservative, nor are many of his ideas. But setting that aside for a moment, if the case against President Obama was predicated not only on his policies but on the way he abused the mechanisms of power, then, surely, Trump deserves criticism as well.

And if a person is truly apprehensive about creeping ""authoritarianism""—these days, the prevailing concern of the same Democrats who push policies that almost exclusively coerce Americans economically—rigid group thinking just isn't feasible anymore. Anti, anti-anti, pro, whatever. The sad truth is that there are simply too many people acting reprehensibly in Washington for many Americans to be a member of any of these tribes.

The answer: No, he will not. He couldn’t heal them if he tried.

American political polarization has been building for decades, not for one or two political cycles. It has more to do with starkly opposed attitudes than with conflicting ideas. Political ideas are remarkably malleable. Trump and Hillary Clinton were, in one sense, two of the least ideological nominees in modern times. Both had spent their public lives arguing virtually every side of every major American political issue.

While Hillary had been steadfast on abortion, she’d been for and against the Iraq war, for and against gay marriage, tough and soft on crime, for and against free trade. She was a political weathervane, always yielding to her party’s prevailing winds.

Trump and Clinton may have been ideologically flexible, but they were fiercely, relentlessly partisan. They fought. They both brought a “just win, baby” mentality to the public arena — Clinton’s honed in the vicious battles of the 1990s and Trump’s honed through a lifetime of deal-making and tabloid conflict. You can’t speak to a loyal Trump voter without hearing a deep appreciation for Trump’s fighting spirit. At long last, they say, the GOP nominated someone who fights as hard as a Democrat.

Clearly the established political machinery – party elites and their corporate backers -have ( in part ) lost control of the nomination process and confront ‘ unwanted ’ candidates who are campaigning with programs and pronouncements that polarize the electorate .
But there are other more specific factors , which have energized the electorate and speak to recent US history . These portend and reflect a realignment of US politics .
In this essay , we will outline these changes and their larger consequences for the future of American politics .
We will examine how these factors affect each of the two major parties .
The ‘ rise and decline ’ of President Obama has seriously dented the appeal of ‘ identity politics ’ – the idea that ethnic , race and gender-rooted ‘ identities ’ can modify the power of finance capital ( Wall Street ) , the militarists , the Zionists and ‘ police-state ’ officials . Clearly manifest voter disenchantment with ‘ identity politics ’ has opened the door for class politics , of a specific kind .
Candidate Bernie Sanders appeals directly to the class interests of workers and salaried employees . But the ‘ class issue ’ arises within the context of an electoral polarization and , as such , it does not reflect a true ‘ class polarization ’ , or rising class struggle in the streets , factories or offices .
In fact , the electoral ‘ class ’ polarization is a reflection of the recent major trade union defeats in Michigan , Wisconsin and Ohio . The trade union confederation ( AFL-CIO ) has almost disappeared as a social and political factor , representing only 7 % of private sector workers . Working class voters are well aware that top trade union leaders , who receive an average of $ 500,000-a-year in salaries and benefits , are deeply ensconced in the Democratic Party elite . While individual workers and local unions are active supporters of the Sanders campaign , they do so as members of an amorphous multi-class electoral movement and not as a unified ‘ workers bloc ’ .
The Sanders electoral movement has not grown out of a national social movement : The peace movement is virtually moribund ; the civil rights movements are weak , fragmented and localized ; the ‘ Black Lives Matter ’ movement has peaked and declined while the ‘ Occupy Wall Street Movement ’ is a distant memory .
In other words , these recent movements , at best , provide some activists and some impetus for the Sanders electoral campaign . Their presence highlights a few of the issues that the Sanders electoral movement promotes in its campaign .
In fact , the Sanders electoral movement does not ‘ grow out ’ of existing , ongoing mass movements as much as it fills the political vacuum resulting from their demise . The electoral insurgency reflects the defeats of trade union officials allied with incumbent Democratic politicians as well as the limitation of the ‘ direct action ’ tactics of the ‘ Black Lives Matter ’ and ‘ Occupy ’ movements .
Since the Sanders electoral movement does not directly and immediately challenge capitalist profits and public budget allocations it has not been subject to state repression . Repressive authorities calculate that this ‘ buzz ’ of electoral activity will last only a few months and then recede into the Democratic Party or voter apathy . Moreover , they are constrained by the fact that tens of millions of Sanders supporters are involved in all the states and not concentrated in any region .
The Sanders electoral movement aggregates hundreds of thousands of micro-local struggles and allows expression of the disaffection of millions with class grievances , at no risk or cost ( as in loss of job or police repression ) to the participants . This is in stark contrast to repression at the workplace or in the urban streets .
The electoral polarization reflects horizontal ( class ) and vertical ( intra-capitalist ) social polarizations .
Below the elite 10 % and especially among the young middle class , political polarization favors the Sanders electoral movement . Trade union bosses , the Black Congressional Caucus members and the Latino establishment all embrace the anointed choice of the political elite of the Democratic Party : Hilary Clinton . Whereas , young Latinos , working women and rank and file trade unionists support the insurgent electoral movement . Significant sectors of the African American population , who have failed to advance ( and have actually regressed ) under Democratic President Obama or have seen police repression expand under the ‘ First Black President ’ , are turning to the insurgent Sanders campaign . Millions of Latinos , disenchanted with their leaders who are tied to the Democratic elite and have done nothing to prevent the massive deportations under Obama , are a potential base of support for ‘ Bernie ’ .
However , the most dynamic social sector in the Sanders electoral movement are students , who are excited by his program of free higher education and the end of post-graduation debt peonage .
The malaise of these sectors finds its expression in the ‘ respectable revolt of the middle class ’ : a voters ’ rebellion , which has temporarily shifted the axis of political debate within the Democratic Party to the left .
The Sanders electoral movement raises fundamental issues of class inequality and racial injustice in the legal , police and economic system . It highlights the oligarchical nature of the political system – even as the Sanders-led movement attempts to use the rules of the system against its owners . These attempts have not been very successful within the Democratic Party apparatus , where the Party bosses have already allocated hundreds of ‘ non-elected ’ so-called ‘ mega-delegates ’ to Clinton – despite Sander ’ s successes in the early primaries .
The very strength of the electoral movement has a strategic weakness : it is in the nature of electoral movements to coalesce for elections and to dissolve after the vote .
The Sanders leadership has made no effort to build a mass national social movement that can continue the class and social struggles during and after the elections . In fact , Sanders ’ pledge to support the established leadership of the Democratic Party if he losses the nomination to Clinton will lead to a profound disillusionment of his supporters and break-up of the electoral movement . The post-convention scenario , especially in the event of ‘ super-delegates ’ crowning Clinton despite a Sanders popular victory at the individual primaries , will be very disruptive .
The Trump electoral campaign has many of the features of a Latin American nationalist-populist movement . Like the Argentine Peronist movement , it combines protectionist , nationalist economic measures that appeal to small and medium size manufacturers and displaced industrial workers with populist right-wing ‘ great nation chauvinism ’ .
This is reflected in Trumps ’ attacks on ‘ globalization ’ – a proxy for Peronist ‘ anti-imperialism ’ .
Trump ’ s attack on the Muslim minority in the US is a thinly veiled embrace of rightwing clerical fascism .
Where Peron campaigned against ‘ financial oligarchies ’ and the invasion of ‘ foreign ideologies ’ , Trump scorns the ‘ elites ’ and denounces the ‘ invasion ’ of Mexican immigrants .
Trump ’ s appeal is rooted in the deep amorphous anger of the downwardly mobile middle class , which has no ideology . . . but plenty of resentment at its declining status , crumbling stability and drug-afflicted families ( Witness the overtly expressed concerns of white voters in the recent New Hampshire primary ) .
Trump projects personal power to workers who bridle under impotent trade unions , disorganized civic groups , and marginalized local business associations , all unable to counter the pillage , power and large-scale corruption of the financial swindlers who rotate between Washington and Wall Street with total impunity .
These ‘ populist ’ classes get vicarious thrills from the spectacle of Trump snapping and slapping career politicians and economic elites alike , even as he parades his capitalist success .
They prize his symbolic defiance of the political elite as he flaunts his own capitalist elite credentials .
For many of his suburban backers he is the ‘ Great Moralizer ’ , who in his excess zeal , occasionally , commits ‘ pardonable ’ gaffes out of zealous exuberance – a crude ‘ Oliver Cromwell ’ for the 21st Century .
Indeed , there also may be a less overt ethno-religious appeal to Trump ’ s campaign : His white-Anglo-Saxon Protestant identity appeals to these same voters in the face of their apparent marginalization . These ‘ Trumpistas ’ are not blind to the fact that not a single WASP judge sits on the Supreme Court and there are few , if any , WASPs among the top economic officials in Treasury , Commerce , or the Fed ( Lew , Fischer , Yellen , Greenspan , Bernacke , Cohen , Pritzker etc. ) . While Trump is not up-front about his identity – it eases his voter appeal .
Among WASP voters , who quietly resent the ‘ Wall Street ’ bailouts and the perceived privileged position of Catholics , Jews and African-Americans in the Obama Administration , Trump ’ s direct , public condemnation of President Bush for deliberately misleading the nation into invading Iraq ( and the implication of treason ) , has been a big plus .
Trump ’ s national-populist appeal is matched by his bellicose militarism and thuggish authoritarianism . His public embrace of torture and police state controls ( to ‘ fight terrorism ’ ) appeals to the pro- military right . On the other hand , his friendly overtures to Russian President Putin ( ‘ one tough guy willing to face another ’ ) and his support to end the Cuban embargo appeals to trade-minded business elites . His calls to withdraw US troops from Europe and Asia appeals to ‘ fortress America ’ voters , while his calls to ‘ carpet bomb ’ ISIS appeals to the nuclear extremists . Interestingly , Trump ’ s support for Social Security and Medicare , as well as his call for medical coverage for the indigent and his open acknowledgement of Planned Parenthood ’ s vital services to poor women , appeals to older citizens , compassionate conservatives and independents .
Trump ’ s left-right amalgam : Protectionist and pro-business appeals , his anti-Wall Street and pro-industrial capitalism proposals , his defense of US workers and attacks on Latino workers and Muslim immigrants have broken the traditional boundaries between popular and rightwing politics of the Republican Party .
‘ Trumpism ’ is not a coherent ideology , but a volatile mix of ‘ improvised positions ’ , adapted to appeal to marginalized workers , resentful middle classes ( marginalized WASPs ) and , above all , to those who feel unrepresented by Wall Street Republicans and liberal Democratic politicians based on identity politics ( black , Hispanic , women and Jews ) .
Trump ’ s movement is based on a cult of the personality : it has enormous capacity to convoke mass meetings without mass organization or a coherent social ideology .
Its fundamental strength is its spontaneity , novelty and hostile focus on strategic elites .
Its strategic weakness is the lack of an organization that can be sustained after the electoral process . There are few ‘ Trumpista ’ cadres and militants among his adoring fans . If Trump loses ( or is cheated out of the nomination by a ‘ unity ’ candidate ’ trotted out by the Party elite ) his organization will dissipate and fragment . If Trump wins the Republican nomination he will draw support from Wall Street , especially if faced with a Sanders Democratic candidacy . If he wins the general election and becomes President , he will seek to strengthen executive power and move toward a ‘ Bonapartist ’ presidency .
The rise of a social democratic movement within the Democratic Party and the rise of a sui generis national-populist rightist movement in the Republican Party reflect the fragmented electorate and deep vertical and horizontal fissures characterizing the US ethno-class structure . Commentators grossly oversimplify when they reduce the revolt to incoherent expressions of ‘ anger ’ .
The shattering of the established elite ’ s control is a product of deeply experienced class and ethnic resentments , of former privileged groups experiencing declining mobility , of local businesspeople experiencing bankruptcy due to ‘ globalization ’ ( imperialism ) and of citizens resentment at the power of finance capital ( the banks ) and its overwhelming control of Washington .
The electoral revolts on the left and right may dissipate but they will have planted the seeds of a democratic transformation or of a nationalist-reactionary revival .","The presidential elections of 2016 have several unique characteristics that defy common wisdom about political practices in 21st century America.

Clearly the established political machinery – party elites and their corporate backers -have (in part) lost control of the nomination process and confront ‘unwanted’ candidates who are campaigning with programs and pronouncements that polarize the electorate.

But there are other more specific factors, which have energized the electorate and speak to recent US history. These portend and reflect a realignment of US politics.

In this essay, we will outline these changes and their larger consequences for the future of American politics.

We will examine how these factors affect each of the two major parties.

Democratic Party Politics: The Context of Realignment

The ‘rise and decline’ of President Obama has seriously dented the appeal of ‘identity politics’ – the idea that ethnic, race and gender-rooted ‘identities’ can modify the power of finance capital (Wall Street), the militarists, the Zionists and ‘police-state’ officials. Clearly manifest voter disenchantment with ‘identity politics’ has opened the door for class politics, of a specific kind.

Candidate Bernie Sanders appeals directly to the class interests of workers and salaried employees. But the ‘class issue’arises within the context of an electoral polarization and, as such, it does not reflect a true ‘class polarization’, or rising class struggle in the streets, factories or offices.

In fact, the electoral ‘class’ polarization is a reflection of the recent major trade union defeats in Michigan, Wisconsin and Ohio. The trade union confederation (AFL-CIO) has almost disappeared as a social and political factor, representing only 7% of private sector workers. Working class voters are well aware that top trade union leaders, who receive an average of $500,000-a-year in salaries and benefits, are deeply ensconced in the Democratic Party elite. While individual workers and local unions are active supporters of the Sanders campaign, they do so as members of an amorphous multi-class electoral movement and not as a unified ‘workers bloc’.

The Sanders electoral movement has not grown out of a national social movement: The peace movement is virtually moribund; the civil rights movements are weak, fragmented and localized; the ‘Black Lives Matter’ movement has peaked and declined while the ‘Occupy Wall Street Movement’ is a distant memory.

In other words, these recent movements, at best, provide some activists and some impetus for the Sanders electoral campaign. Their presence highlights a few of the issues that the Sanders electoral movement promotes in its campaign.

In fact, the Sanders electoral movement does not ‘grow out’ of existing, ongoing mass movements as much as it fills the political vacuum resulting from their demise. The electoral insurgency reflects the defeats of trade union officials allied with incumbent Democratic politicians as well as the limitation of the ‘direct action’ tactics of the ‘Black Lives Matter’ and ‘Occupy’ movements.

Since the Sanders electoral movement does not directly and immediately challenge capitalist profits and public budget allocations it has not been subject to state repression. Repressive authorities calculate that this ‘buzz’ of electoral activity will last only a few months and then recede into the Democratic Party or voter apathy. Moreover, they are constrained by the fact that tens of millions of Sanders supporters are involved in all the states and not concentrated in any region.

The Sanders electoral movement aggregates hundreds of thousands of micro-local struggles and allows expression of the disaffection of millions with class grievances, at no risk or cost (as in loss of job or police repression) to the participants. This is in stark contrast to repression at the workplace or in the urban streets.

The electoral polarization reflects horizontal (class) and vertical (intra-capitalist) social polarizations.

Below the elite 10% and especially among the young middle class, political polarization favors the Sanders electoral movement. Trade union bosses, the Black Congressional Caucus members and the Latino establishment all embrace the anointed choice of the political elite of the Democratic Party: Hilary Clinton. Whereas, young Latinos, working women and rank and file trade unionists support the insurgent electoral movement. Significant sectors of the African American population, who have failed to advance (and have actually regressed) under Democratic President Obama or have seen police repression expand under the ‘First Black President’, are turning to the insurgent Sanders campaign. Millions of Latinos, disenchanted with their leaders who are tied to the Democratic elite and have done nothing to prevent the massive deportations under Obama, are a potential base of support for ‘Bernie’.

However, the most dynamic social sector in the Sanders electoral movement are students, who are excited by his program of free higher education and the end of post-graduation debt peonage.

The malaise of these sectors finds its expression in the ‘respectable revolt of the middle class’: a voters’ rebellion, which has temporarily shifted the axis of political debate within the Democratic Party to the left.

The Sanders electoral movement raises fundamental issues of class inequality and racial injustice in the legal, police and economic system. It highlights the oligarchical nature of the political system – even as the Sanders-led movement attempts to use the rules of the system against its owners. These attempts have not been very successful within the Democratic Party apparatus, where the Party bosses have already allocated hundreds of ‘non-elected’ so-called ‘mega-delegates’ to Clinton – despite Sander’s successes in the early primaries.

The very strength of the electoral movement has a strategic weakness: it is in the nature of electoral movements to coalesce for elections and to dissolve after the vote.

The Sanders leadership has made no effort to build a mass national social movement that can continue the class and social struggles during and after the elections. In fact, Sanders’ pledge to support the established leadership of the Democratic Party if he losses the nomination to Clinton will lead to a profound disillusionment of his supporters and break-up of the electoral movement. The post-convention scenario, especially in the event of ‘super-delegates’ crowning Clinton despite a Sanders popular victory at the individual primaries, will be very disruptive.

Trump and ‘Revolt on the Right’

The Trump electoral campaign has many of the features of a Latin American nationalist-populist movement. Like the Argentine Peronist movement, it combines protectionist, nationalist economic measures that appeal to small and medium size manufacturers and displaced industrial workers with populist right-wing ‘great nation chauvinism’.

This is reflected in Trumps’ attacks on ‘globalization’ – a proxy for Peronist ‘anti-imperialism’.

Trump’s attack on the Muslim minority in the US is a thinly veiled embrace of rightwing clerical fascism.

Where Peron campaigned against ‘financial oligarchies’ and the invasion of ‘foreign ideologies’, Trump scorns the ‘elites’and denounces the ‘invasion’ of Mexican immigrants.

Trump’s appeal is rooted in the deep amorphous anger of the downwardly mobile middle class, which has no ideology . . . but plenty of resentment at its declining status, crumbling stability and drug-afflicted families (Witness the overtly expressed concerns of white voters in the recent New Hampshire primary).

Trump projects personal power to workers who bridle under impotent trade unions, disorganized civic groups, and marginalized local business associations, all unable to counter the pillage, power and large-scale corruption of the financial swindlers who rotate between Washington and Wall Street with total impunity.

These ‘populist’ classes get vicarious thrills from the spectacle of Trump snapping and slapping career politicians and economic elites alike, even as he parades his capitalist success.

They prize his symbolic defiance of the political elite as he flaunts his own capitalist elite credentials.

For many of his suburban backers he is the ‘Great Moralizer’, who in his excess zeal, occasionally, commits ‘pardonable’ gaffes out of zealous exuberance – a crude ‘Oliver Cromwell’ for the 21st Century.

Indeed, there also may be a less overt ethno-religious appeal to Trump’s campaign: His white-Anglo-Saxon Protestant identity appeals to these same voters in the face of their apparent marginalization. These ‘Trumpistas’ are not blind to the fact that not a single WASP judge sits on the Supreme Court and there are few, if any, WASPs among the top economic officials in Treasury, Commerce, or the Fed (Lew, Fischer, Yellen, Greenspan, Bernacke, Cohen, Pritzker etc.). While Trump is not up-front about his identity – it eases his voter appeal.

Among WASP voters, who quietly resent the ‘Wall Street’ bailouts and the perceived privileged position of Catholics, Jews and African-Americans in the Obama Administration, Trump’s direct, public condemnation of President Bush for deliberately misleading the nation into invading Iraq (and the implication of treason), has been a big plus.

Trump’s national-populist appeal is matched by his bellicose militarism and thuggish authoritarianism. His public embrace of torture and police state controls (to ‘fight terrorism’) appeals to the pro- military right. On the other hand, his friendly overtures to Russian President Putin (‘one tough guy willing to face another’) and his support to end the Cuban embargo appeals to trade-minded business elites. His calls to withdraw US troops from Europe and Asia appeals to ‘fortress America’ voters, while his calls to ‘carpet bomb’ ISIS appeals to the nuclear extremists. Interestingly, Trump’s support for Social Security and Medicare, as well as his call for medical coverage for the indigent and his open acknowledgement of Planned Parenthood’s vital services to poor women, appeals to older citizens, compassionate conservatives and independents.

Trump’s left-right amalgam: Protectionist and pro-business appeals, his anti-Wall Street and pro-industrial capitalism proposals, his defense of US workers and attacks on Latino workers and Muslim immigrants have broken the traditional boundaries between popular and rightwing politics of the Republican Party.

‘Trumpism’ is not a coherent ideology, but a volatile mix of ‘improvised positions’, adapted to appeal to marginalized workers, resentful middle classes (marginalized WASPs) and, above all, to those who feel unrepresented by Wall Street Republicans and liberal Democratic politicians based on identity politics (black, Hispanic, women and Jews).

Trump’s movement is based on a cult of the personality: it has enormous capacity to convoke mass meetings without mass organization or a coherent social ideology.

Its fundamental strength is its spontaneity, novelty and hostile focus on strategic elites.

Its strategic weakness is the lack of an organization that can be sustained after the electoral process. There are few ‘Trumpista’ cadres and militants among his adoring fans. If Trump loses (or is cheated out of the nomination by a ‘unity’ candidate’ trotted out by the Party elite) his organization will dissipate and fragment. If Trump wins the Republican nomination he will draw support from Wall Street, especially if faced with a Sanders Democratic candidacy. If he wins the general election and becomes President, he will seek to strengthen executive power and move toward a ‘Bonapartist’ presidency.

Conclusion

The rise of a social democratic movement within the Democratic Party and the rise of a sui generis national-populist rightist movement in the Republican Party reflect the fragmented electorate and deep vertical and horizontal fissures characterizing the US ethno-class structure. Commentators grossly oversimplify when they reduce the revolt to incoherent expressions of ‘anger’.

The shattering of the established elite’s control is a product of deeply experienced class and ethnic resentments, of former privileged groups experiencing declining mobility, of local businesspeople experiencing bankruptcy due to ‘globalization’(imperialism) and of citizens resentment at the power of finance capital (the banks) and its overwhelming control of Washington.

The electoral revolts on the left and right may dissipate but they will have planted the seeds of a democratic transformation or of a nationalist-reactionary revival.",www.globalresearch.ca,center,nlUpkw6TED6fvkaw

Dear Reader ( and particularly those among you who will be experiencing kalsarikännit over the holiday weekend ) ,
Well , as Bob Menendez said when he walked through the door of a certain Hoboken “ social club , ” I ’ m home . And as the New Jersey senator said when the electronic cash-counting machine broke down , I ’ ve got a lot of work to do . So , as the former vice chairman of the Senate Democratic Caucus said when the bed in his hotel suite was covered in various Las Vegas–area “ hostesses , ” I ’ m gon na jump right in .
As everyone should , I was reading the new essay by my old friend , Matt “ Two-Drink Minimum ” Labash . He writes about Antifa and all that jazz . One passage stuck out for me . Matt “ I Only Carry Stacks of Single Dollar Bills ” Labash profiles a couple of anti-Antifa activists who get called fascists and white supremacists , despite the fact one is half-Japanese and the other is Samoan and neither is a fascist nor white supremacist ( more on that in a bit ) . The Samoan guy goes by the name “ Tiny ” and serves as a kind of bodyguard to Joey at various protests and counter-protests . Matt “ If Only You Could See My Tattoos ” Labash writes :
Tiny , 21 , also came to politics through anger . Convinced all Trumpkins were racists , “ I ’ d drive around and beat them up , ” he says nonchalantly . When he couldn ’ t find any to sass him back in street encounters after he ’ d provoked them , he ’ d go home and watch other Trump supporters get pounded online . “ It made me happy . F—in ’ racists getting beaten up , ” he said . While looking for more anti-Trumpkin-violence to enjoy , he clicked one day on video from one of Joey ’ s rallies . “ He gave a speech ” about love and unity , says Tiny . “ Everything he said made me confused . I thought all these f—ers were violent and racist . So I kind of had a change of heart and reached out to Joey . If I had found out about antifa before finding out about him , I ’ d have been antifa , too . ”
This reminded me of a passage from Michael Burleigh ’ s wonderful book , The Third Reich : A New History ( which you can also find in my book ) . He recounts a story of a young Patrick Leigh Fermor , a British guy traveling around Germany in the early 1930s . One night , he made some drinking buddies in a Rhineland workers ’ pub . They were still all wearing their nightshift overalls . One of the guys he met offered to let Fermor crash at his pad . Fermor climbed a ladder to the attic where the guest bed was , and he found “ a shrine to Hitleriana ” :
The walls were covered with flags , photographs , posters , slogans and emblems . His SA uniforms hung neatly ironed on a hanger . . . When I said that it must be rather claustrophobic with all that stuff on the walls , he laughed and sat down on the bed , and said : “ Mensch ! You should have seen it last year ! You would have laughed ! Then it was all red flags , stars , hammers , sickles , pictures of Lenin and Stalin and Workers of the World Unite ! . . . Then , suddenly when Hitler came to power , I understood it was all nonsense and lies . I realized Adolf was the man for me . All of a sudden ! ” He snapped his fingers in the air . “ And here I am ! ” . . . Had a lot of people done the same , then ? “ Millions ! I tell you , I was astonished how easily they all changed sides ! ”
Now , I don ’ t think a lot of Antifa types are poised to become Trumpers , never mind alt-righters or fascists or Nazis ( all of these things are different , by the way ) . Nor do I think there will be lots of conversions the other way .
But I do think there ’ s a tendency to take all of these people too seriously . Put aside the question of whether Antifa is “ morally indistinguishable ” from neo-Nazis , as my friend and colleague Marc Thiessen writes . Also , leave aside whether they ’ re ideologically similar .
It seems to me the elephant in the room people that keep breezing past is whether or not these people are psychologically similar . I remember when Antifa types first started showing up on television breaking stuff , setting fires , punching people , and the like , my wife said , “ Those are just idiot boys looking for an excuse to break stuff and get in fights . ”
Can anyone really dispute that this is a huge part of what ’ s going on with all these radicals on the left and the alt-right ? A big swathe of the bad things that have happened over the last 10,000 years can be attributed to hormonally charged young men pulling stupid crap . Yes , yes , before the feminists get mad at me , plenty of young women have done stupid crap , too ( indeed , there ’ s a weird school of thought that thinks it ’ s a great triumph when women live down to the lowest standards of men , but that ’ s a subject for another time ) .
If you want to get all Darwinian about it , you could chalk it up the common behavior of male chimpanzees and humans alike of getting into fights to impress females . If you want to get all Moynihanny about it , you can blame the degradation of families and fatherhood . Or you can blame secularization , or the ennui that comes with late-stage capitalism , or the frick ’ n influence of Nietzsche or Mr. Rogers . The point is young people , particularly males , love to create drama , defy authority , and anoint themselves the heroic warriors of their tale .
In that passage from Matt “ Those Aren ’ t Pillows ” Labash ’ s essay , Tiny admits he would have joined Antifa if he had stumbled on a different YouTube video . That pretty much tells you all you need to know . Some people just want an excuse to act on impulses that have remarkably little , if anything , to do with ideology . Radicalism is better understood as a psychological drive than a serious intellectual position .
The best analogy is to criminal outfits . I ’ m sure if you talked to a Crip or a Blood , they ’ d be able to talk your ear off about how different Crips and Bloods are from each other . But I think all rational people understand the differences are smaller than those between Coke and Pepsi . My hunch is that if you held everything else constant , a Crip born in Blood territory would grow up to be a Blood . If Tony Soprano had been born a Lupertazzi instead , how much would change ? And if Millhouse had been born in Shelbyville , he ’ d be saying those damn Springfieldians are the ones addicted to sweets .
Intellectuals and ideologues of various stripes tend not to like these kinds of explanations , for the largely laudable reason that they make a living working with ideas ( and partisans like to make hay wherever they can ) . This is why conservatives often place too much emphasis on bad left-wing ideas to explain the breakdown in morals , marriage , etc . As I ’ ve written many times before , the car and the birth-control pill have — for good and ill — done more to overturn settled institutions and customs than Nietzsche or Marx ever could . But pills and automobiles are hard to argue with , so like drunks searching for their car keys under the street lamp because that ’ s where the light is good , intellectuals focus on the stuff they can argue with .
Take this fairly representative Twitter thread from a writer trying to insist that there are deep and profound ideological differences between Antifa and the alt-right , particularly this bit :
I don ’ t want to start cannibalizing my forthcoming book , but the simple fact is that most of these ideological rationalizations for why Antifa is so very different from the alt-right or “ fascists ” are morally obtuse distractions . Sure , the ideological arguments invoked by Antifa and the alt-right are different . Fine . Also , who cares ? Let ’ s say for the sake of argument Antifa is “ better ” than the alt-right ? Congrats ! You ’ ve established that you ’ re better than Nazis . Good for you . The relevant question is whether Antifa ’ s behavior is morally or legally justifiable and the obvious answer is “ Of course not . ”
But as Irving Kristol once said , “ When we lack the will to see things as they really are , there is nothing so mystifying as the obvious. ” And so supposedly serious people expend enormous energy trying to explain why their pet goon squads are morally superior to other goon squads .

By the early 1990s , about 5 percent of the town 's population was Mexican . People told their friends and family about these jobs , and more and more Hispanic workers came to Worthington — a phenomenon called chain migration .
By 2010 , more than one in three residents were Hispanic .
Worthington is so fascinating to sociologists because it shows a new type of migration — one they say they ’ ve never seen before . Traditionally , immigrants from Latin America and Asia live in gateway cities like San Francisco , New York , and Miami . But now , Cornell University sociologist Dan Lichter said , `` You 've got these different population groups that are spreading out in ways we have n't seen in the past . ''
Part of it is nonwhite Americans leaving urban enclaves and going to the suburbs . It 's a fulfillment of the traditional American dream — a path European immigrants took in past generations to leave poor , segregated neighborhoods that relegated them to a lower social class .
The other part is new immigrants going directly to the suburbs and other traditionally white areas , like Worthington .
But this is n't a story about what minorities have done . It 's about how many white people have reacted to increasing exposure to nonwhite populations , who are following in their footsteps and pursuing the traditional American dream . The reaction is not always articulated or even intentional ; in fact , most people say they want to live in a diverse and integrated community ; they , too , have the dream that no one will be judged by the color of their skin .
But data shows that as minorities move into suburbs , white families are making small and personal decisions that add velocity to the momentum of discrimination . They are increasingly choosing to self-segregate into racially isolated communities — `` hunkering down , '' as Lichter likes to call it — and preserving a specific kind of dream .
A few years ago , researchers conducted an experiment in which they took a group of about 200 white people and primed some of them with different news articles . When the respondents were reminded about America 's growing diversity , they showed more bias against black people .
`` These findings are consistent with a concept known as Group Threat Theory , which is the idea that when minority groups grow in size or power , the majority group feels threatened , '' wrote Washington University researcher Allison Skinner .
A recent PRRI survey showed that half of Republicans — and one in three Americans — believe more racial diversity would have a negative impact on America :
A growing number of people are worried about the country becoming majority minority , including one in three Trump supporters .
And more than half of white Americans believe the country 's `` way of life '' needs to be protected against foreign influences . About 84 percent of Trump supporters feel that way .
`` People like Trump were able to exploit exposure to race , now that all these areas are exposed , '' Lichter said .
The phrase `` way of life '' is imprecise , and perhaps it could indicate an allegiance to vague terms like freedom and liberty . But coded in the context is the assumption that our American culture is static — that what we have now , even though this differs for everyone , is more American than what outsiders can bring .
This type of migration is perhaps the inevitable outcome of a diversifying nation that takes pride in its specific narrative of upward mobility . Starting in the 1970s , Asians and Latin Americans began arriving to the US in large numbers . Now most public school children are nonwhite . By 2020 , most children will be nonwhite . And by 2045 , most people in America will be nonwhite .
For example , in the Los Angeles suburb of San Marino , a large number of Chinese families began moving in — and despite some underlying unrest , there wasn ’ t much coarse rhetoric about race , according to Columbia University sociologist Merlin Chowkwanyun . Rather , more white families moved out , fewer moved in — and by 2005 there were stories like this one in the local paper where a white mother lamented :
I know [ my daughter ] can do it , get good enough grades , so it doesn ’ t bother me . But to hear her say she ca n't win [ a social chair ] election because Asians vote for Asians , that bothers me .
In Worthington , rumors cropped up that the town had become dangerous , even though crime data shows it was n't any more dangerous than similarly sized towns .
These are the kinds of passive tensions that have cropped up with this new trend of migration . There is , however , a small community of people who are taking this in-group favoritism and developing it into a more nativist ideology . The most concise and unfiltered expression comes from former Notre Dame football coach Lou Holtz , who said a few months ago , `` I do n't want to become you . I do n't want to speak your language . I do n't want to celebrate your holidays . I sure as hell do n't want to cheer for your soccer teams . ''
While this crude expression of nativism is less common , though perhaps on the upswing , it is a sentiment that has been historically engineered into the fabric of this nation — with xenophobic immigration laws , with discriminatory housing laws , with Jim Crow laws , with slavery . There ’ s less overt discrimination now , but we ’ re still at the mercy of this segregating momentum that our past has inflicted upon us . It still decides where we live and whom we live with .
White people say they want diversity — but their actions show it ’ s only of a certain kind
A few years ago , researchers invited a handful of Illinois residents to talk to them about where they lived .
On one side of the table was a researcher . On the other side was a resident . And in between , on a table , was a simple map of the Chicago metropolitan area .
The residents talked about how they ended up living where they do now . They talked about the neighborhoods they 've been to and ones they have n't . And usually , without prompting , they talked about race .
Residents would point to an area they 've never been before , an area in the outer suburbs , and assume it was a white and wealthy area . They 'd do the same with the inner city but assume it was a poor black area . Without any real evidence , there was a mental map built into the city 's geography .
Watching all of this behind a window was University of Illinois sociologist Maria Krysan . This was part of an experiment she was doing for an upcoming book .
What makes her research unique is her fascination with the process of where we end up living , and not just the outcome .
Recent migrations patterns do n't necessarily show the same kind of `` white flight '' we saw in the 1960s , where a neighborhood 's demographic shifts drastically in just a couple of years because white people leave . Rather , Krysan said , `` In the last several decades , the demographic characterization is less about the flight — less about whites fleeing a certain type of neighborhood — and more about decisions that people make when looking at where they 're going to move next . ''
One thing she 's found when she asked Chicago-area residents about their housing search is that people of all races say they want to live in a relatively diverse , integrated neighborhood .
When it comes time for the housing search , black and Latino residents look in neighborhoods that are as diverse as they say they want .
White residents `` give a socially acceptable answer in the abstract , '' Krysan said , but they end up searching and living in much less diverse areas .
What this shows is that it 's not black and Latino people who are self-segregating into neighborhoods — a myth that is often perpetuated , Krysan said . Rather , it 's white residents who say they want more diversity but end up looking in less diverse areas .
Krysan found similar results when she gave nearly 800 adults in Cook County , Illinois , a diagram of a neighborhood and asked them to fill out their ideal racial and ethnic mix .
Then she asked residents to construct a neighborhood in which they would feel least comfortable .
What she found was that people , on average , wanted a specific kind of diversity .
For example , white residents said their ideal neighborhood was about half white , with other racial groups filling out the rest of the community . But the neighborhood they least desired had a lot more African Americans and Arab Americans .
The primary reason white respondents said they 'd be uncomfortable in their least desired neighborhood was poor neighborhood quality — especially crime . A close second was cultural differences and concerns . One white respondent told the researchers :
If this were the neighborhood makeup , you could almost be certain that it would be lower income , higher crime , worse school . Not because of inherent characteristics of these people , but people of these backgrounds have a lower socioeconomic status and opportunity for education . Also I am just not used to … it would be a culture shock . Just like moving into any new culture . It is difficult in general to see people that don ’ t look like them .
There 's certainly an amount of segregation caused by poverty , which is more rampant in communities of color . But research by Indiana University sociologist Samuel Kye found that even in middle-class suburbs , a strong presence of minority groups causes white families to stop moving in . This has caused segregation in Asian and Latino suburbs to actually get worse in the past 25 years , and segregation in black suburbs to stay high .
In the mid-20th century , white suburbanites reacted very differently to minorities , specifically black people , moving into their neighborhoods . Some communities prevented minorities from moving into their town with various housing and legal maneuvers . Chowkwanyun , the Columbia sociologist , said in virtually every suburban newspaper in that era , there were reports of confrontation and violence when a black person moved in .
This is where recent minority suburbanization differs from black suburbanization of past generations : When Chowkwanyun studied California 's San Gabriel Valley , where Asian Americans became a large part of the population , he said he could find few overt conflicts .
Rather , it was a passive reaction . When white families moved out , they were more often replaced by Asian households , which is in line with what much of the research tells us about other similar suburbs .
Research led by Lichter , the Cornell sociologist , shows that in the past 25 years , the segregation between white people and minorities has n't changed much within cities ; racial groups are still very separate , though slightly less so . What has changed , though , is how segregated one town is from another .
White families are increasingly self-segregating themselves in new ways — and it 's largely in the form of their moving decisions . Lichter 's research shows white households are now moving to what sociologists call the `` exurbs '' — gated communities , unincorporated housing developments , and the countryside . This is why the only communities in the US that have seen significant white growth are places that were already predominantly white .
`` You 've got one group of white Americans who are comfortable with diversity and integrating with minorities , including blacks and Hispanics and Asians , '' he said , `` and another America that is hunkering down in overwhelmingly white areas in overwhelmingly white places — and you see them moving further out . ''
`` There are new forms of segregation taking place here , where a lot of this is motivated by what whites do — the white reaction to minority growth , rather than what minorities themselves are doing , '' Lichter said . `` The exposure of whites to minorities is just at a standstill , even though these communities have become more diverse . Whites are leaving these areas that are diversifying . ''
Even when predominantly white suburbs are surrounded by diverse communities , other research shows white families are n't as comfortable moving into those nearby areas .
And even when white families live in relatively diverse suburbs or urban neighborhoods , the one place integration has to be faced head on is in traditional public schools , where catchment areas determine where your child goes .
In a place like North Carolina , white families are using charter schools to escape this system . And as a whole , studies show that charter schools have created more segregation than traditional schools . It can be a tool to integrate schools , but that ’ s not what ’ s happening — white children who choose to go to charter schools are choosing to go to predominantly white schools , and black children to a predominantly black one . In short , charter schools are being used by some as a self-segregation tool .
And it 's contributed to the increasing rate of predominantly black and Hispanic schools with high poverty levels .
`` They just want to keep with their own spaces , and not go beyond that , '' said Casey Cobb , a University of Connecticut education researcher . `` That 's a vehicle that allows them to continue to do that . Their preferences are being allowed to play out . ''
This is what is exceedingly clear : Many white families in America , many of whom have ancestors who fulfilled the journey of the American dream , want to live in a certain type of community and want their kids to be educated in a certain type of school . It 's often not malicious , not overt , and not articulated . It 's just the broad pattern of how white Americans move about this land , and perhaps that 's the definition of a privilege that is increasingly being called out .
Unfortunately , that does n't always leave room for racial and ethnic minorities to do the same .
We have differing mental maps of where we can ( and can ’ t ) live
One of the first things I said to Maria Krysan , the University of Illinois sociologist , was that her research gave me hope .
The reason is that it breaks down why people move to certain places , and it 's not necessarily because they explicitly do n't want to be around other racial groups .
In the experiment I described before , where she had researchers talk to residents using a map as a conversational object , Krysan said she was fascinated by how people talked about places they 'd never even been to .
It points to this mental map that everyone has of their surroundings — and often , she says that knowledge comes from social networks , lived experiences , and the media . These things are n't always accurate . We 're more familiar with some places , which makes our perception of them more accurate .
This builds on research she did on people in the Chicago area , where she asked people of different races if they knew anything about various neighborhoods .
The reason she asked this question was because , as she says , `` It 's very hard to move to a place if you 've never heard of it . ''
What she found was that white respondents had a blind spot for neighborhoods that were diverse , even if they were majority white . Meanwhile , African Americans were less likely to know about far-flung suburbs .
If you 've ever moved in your life — or 17 times , in my case — this makes perfect sense . Krysan said , `` If my friends all look like me , their knowledge is about places where people like me live . ''
Sure , research seems to show that some white families just do n't want to live near too many minorities . But a certain amount of this appears to be about being conscious of the systemic racism of the past that separates us by socioeconomic class , by social networks , and by where we live .
Part of the reason white people may not be looking for housing in neighborhoods that are as diverse as they say they want might be because they just do n't know about these areas or have inaccurate preconceptions about them .
It 's this societal momentum that this country spent a lot of money and effort engineering — one that 's discriminatory and xenophobic . That 's why housing advocates celebrated the 2015 Supreme Court ruling that affirmed the Fair Housing Act can be used to `` affirmatively further fair housing . '' In other words , it said public policy should proactively promote racial integration .
Many opponents believe this is governmental overreach . Trump 's nominee for the Department of Housing and Urban Development , Ben Carson , said this would allow the government to do `` social engineering . ''
To that , housing advocate Erin Boggs says : `` We have already been socially engineered . We 're living in a socially engineered environment because of our history . ''
Martin Luther King Jr. said the arc of the moral universe bends toward justice — and it 's something Obama has espoused often during his presidency . But the arc seems rigged so far the other way , and not just in depth but in breadth . It seems segregation is like a strong wave — and if you do n't swim against the tide , if you do nothing , then we go backward .","There's a small town in Minnesota called Worthington. It's a place that fascinates sociologists.

In the 1980s, Worthington was on its way to becoming a ghost town, like many other white, blue-collar communities.

But in 1989, the local pork processing plant added 650 jobs and attracted new workers, many of Mexican descent, by giving them one free week of lodging and food.

The white reaction to this new suburban migration

A few years ago, researchers conducted an experiment in which they took a group of about 200 white people and primed some of them with different news articles. When the respondents were reminded about America's growing diversity, they showed more bias against black people.

""These findings are consistent with a concept known as Group Threat Theory, which is the idea that when minority groups grow in size or power, the majority group feels threatened,"" wrote Washington University researcher Allison Skinner.

It plays out in broader polls too.

A recent PRRI survey showed that half of Republicans — and one in three Americans — believe more racial diversity would have a negative impact on America:

A growing number of people are worried about the country becoming majority minority, including one in three Trump supporters.

And more than half of white Americans believe the country's ""way of life"" needs to be protected against foreign influences. About 84 percent of Trump supporters feel that way.

""People like Trump were able to exploit exposure to race, now that all these areas are exposed,"" Lichter said.

And by 2045, most people in America will be nonwhite.

But in most communities, white families haven’t overtly resisted.

For example, in the Los Angeles suburb of San Marino, a large number of Chinese families began moving in — and despite some underlying unrest, there wasn’t much coarse rhetoric about race, according to Columbia University sociologist Merlin Chowkwanyun. Rather, more white families moved out, fewer moved in — and by 2005 there were stories like this one in the local paper where a white mother lamented:

“ Sarah from the left and Beth from the right , ” both former lawyers and now a writer and a business coach , respectively , became friends more than a decade ago as sorority sisters at Transylvania University in Kentucky—and today , they want to teach Americans how to have productive , civilized conversations about politics with their friends and family members . * Holland and Silvers started their podcast in 2015 as a way to have the kinds of conversations they wanted to see more of in America , in which each participant disaffiliates from her respective political party and they learn about and discuss particular political issues together . I Think You ’ re Wrong ( But I ’ m Listening ) aims to help readers engage in the same kinds of conversations in their own lives .
I Think You ’ re Wrong ( But I ’ m Listening ) provides a useful framework for readers on how to have these kinds of political conversations with those they love and yet disagree with—advising readers to , for example , “ take off their jerseys ” ( that is , deliberately distance themselves from the full platform of policy positions supported by their chosen political party and instead examine each issue individually ) and find their “ whys ” ( talk about issues in terms of each person ’ s individual vision for what an ideal end result might be ) . It also advises readers early and often to abandon the idea of winning an argument or convincing other people of the wrongness of their positions , and to instead aim to have a conversation in which each party understands more fully why the other holds a given belief . Each participant , they emphasize , should approach the conversation with curiosity , a willingness to leave room for nuance , and grace , in the “ goodwill ” sense of the word .
In Holland and Silvers ’ book as well as their podcast , the two exemplify the kind of productive conversation that can ensue when two people with what appear to be wildly different ideologies each show up with earnest curiosity , humility , and manners .

“Sarah from the left and Beth from the right,” both former lawyers and now a writer and a business coach, respectively, became friends more than a decade ago as sorority sisters at Transylvania University in Kentucky—and today, they want to teach Americans how to have productive, civilized conversations about politics with their friends and family members.* Holland and Silvers started their podcast in 2015 as a way to have the kinds of conversations they wanted to see more of in America, in which each participant disaffiliates from her respective political party and they learn about and discuss particular political issues together. I Think You’re Wrong (But I’m Listening) aims to help readers engage in the same kinds of conversations in their own lives.

Read: How politics in Trump’s America divides families

I Think You’re Wrong (But I’m Listening) provides a useful framework for readers on how to have these kinds of political conversations with those they love and yet disagree with—advising readers to, for example, “take off their jerseys” (that is, deliberately distance themselves from the full platform of policy positions supported by their chosen political party and instead examine each issue individually) and find their “whys” (talk about issues in terms of each person’s individual vision for what an ideal end result might be). It also advises readers early and often to abandon the idea of winning an argument or convincing other people of the wrongness of their positions, and to instead aim to have a conversation in which each party understands more fully why the other holds a given belief. Each participant, they emphasize, should approach the conversation with curiosity, a willingness to leave room for nuance, and grace, in the “goodwill” sense of the word.

In Holland and Silvers’ book as well as their podcast, the two exemplify the kind of productive conversation that can ensue when two people with what appear to be wildly different ideologies each show up with earnest curiosity, humility, and manners. In one chapter of the book, they describe researching the history of the American welfare system together, each learning that their respective understandings of how the system works, both in reality and in theory, were flawed in different ways. In an interview, however, they acknowledged that not every conversation about politics among people of different viewpoints has the same level of generosity on both sides—and conversations with unequal levels of generosity seem to happen more often nowadays, in a time when Americans of opposing political views trust one another less than in the past.",www.theatlantic.com,left,XOSzXFDn1u8vyiO2

USATODAY

MADISON, Wis. — Ever since I lived in this idyllic city between two lakes as a graduate student in the 1970s, I have been fascinated — and perplexed — by Wisconsin's schizophrenic political personality.

How is it possible for the same state to be the home of Robert ""Fighting Bob"" La Follette, the iconic populist senator and Progressive Party presidential candidate in 1924, and Joe McCarthy, the hard-core conservative senator behind the Communist witch hunts of the 1950s?

Such broad political disparity didn't stop there. In 1973, civil rights and anti-Vietnam War activist Paul Soglin, a bona fide ""radical"" at the time, was elected mayor of Madison. He succeeded William Dyke, an ultra-conservative who was segregationist Lester Maddox's running-mate on the American Independent Party's presidential ticket in 1976. Soglin, incidentally, is mayor again today.

Then there are the current U.S. senators: conservative Republican Ron Johnson and liberal Democrat Tammy Baldwin. They represent the widest ideological gulf of any state's senators, according to a 2013 National Journal ranking of voting records. Baldwin, the Senate's first openly gay member, was listed as the 5th most liberal; Johnson the 9th most conservative.

""Wisconsin defies political trends. It doesn't swing, it pivots,"" observes Rutgers University political science professor Ross Baker. ""Any state can spring an occasional political surprise, but Wisconsin makes a habit of it.""

Trying to figure out why is instructive as another native son, Gov. Scott Walker, makes a run for the Republican presidential nomination next year, casting himself as Ronald Reagan's natural heir.

Indeed, part of Walker's compelling story line is his ability to win two elections as governor and survive a recall election in a swing state with such a strong liberal tradition. Don't forget, Wisconsinites repeatedly elected to the U.S. Senate William Proxmire, a liberal and early anti-Vietnam war opponent who replaced McCarthy following the Red-baiting senator's death. And they elected Democrat Russ Feingold, the champion of campaign finance changes until he got knocked off by Johnson in 2010.

Michael Wagner, a political science and journalism professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, agrees that the state's politics ""look pretty schizophrenic to people on the outside — and the inside, too.""

His explanation is that the political polarization that increasingly is gripping Washington existed long before in Wisconsin, although it has become more exacerbated in the last decade. Not only are voters sharply polarized, but they are pretty equally split as Wagner notes, so a very small swing vote can decide whether a conservative Republican or liberal Democrat wins.

Like most states, midterm elections favor Republicans because their loyal voters, namely whites, turn out in higher proportions than Democratic voters, mainly minorities who are more likely to show up in presidential years. Wagner notes that Walker and Johnson won their races in midterm election cycles, while Baldwin won in 2012, when President Obama topped the ticket.

Wisconsin is one of the least diverse states in the nation; whites account for 88% of the population. Yet when the electorate is so narrowly divided, that small minority vote — or its absence — can swing an election.

Political scientist Wagner notes that both sides have gotten very good at winning elections. The loser: consensus politics that serve the greater good. ""Compromise is not possible with such polarization,"" he says.

Such a bitter divide means politicians elected to statewide office wind up representing the interests of those that got 'em there, the greater good of the state be damned.

That's the chilling takeaway for Washington, and it explains why so little has been accomplished in recent years in the nation's capital. Compromise is a dirty word. It's all about winning, now.

( Feb. 15 ) AP
OROVILLE , Calif. — Eldon Hofeling raises his voice over the roar of backhoes , helicopters , tumbling rocks , dump trucks and 750,000 gallons of water rushing past every second .
Steps away from his house , hundreds of contractors are struggling to repair the Oroville Dam before the spring rains arrive in earnest . A stream of semi-trailers unloads chunks of rocks , which backhoes then load onto large dump trucks to deliver to weak spots on the other side of the dam . Helicopters chatter overhead every 90 seconds , lifting in even more rocks to shore up the dam ’ s top . Diesel engines rumble day and night , contractors bark orders and neighbors wander by to take a look .
Every bedroom window in Hofeling 's house looks out over the dam , at what is now a staging area . Contractors told him this repair effort could last weeks .
The mere threat of a dam failure last week was enough to temporarily evacuate about 200,000 people living downstream . And a collapse could cause death and devastation in both the short- and long-term : This reservoir stores water to irrigate downstream farms and provide drinking water for Los Angeles .
Residents here in Oroville , Marysville and Yuba City are now living with the fresh knowledge that maybe this dam isn ’ t as safe as they thought . That fact that the water benefits people hundreds of miles away from this danger is reverberating around these conservative communities that see little common ground with the far more liberal Californians on the coast and in Silicon Valley .
This isn ’ t just idle talk : One of the first signs heading into Oroville , population 16,000 , urges residents to support seceding from California to create a new state of Jefferson . Here in inland California , Gov . Jerry Brown ’ s name evokes disgust , and President Donald Trump is seen as the one who really cares . Here , residents distrust a state government they think is all-too-eager to help undocumented immigrants and build a bullet train to serve the rich coastal elites , leaving them with little .
“ I bet that if they put this effort into building it right the first time , they wouldn ’ t have to do all of this , ” Hofeling , 66 , says as a backhoe drops rocks into a dump truck , shaking the ground .
It ’ s a refrain voiced time and again in Oroville and the surrounding towns : The liberal , more populated parts of California suck up all the political attention and public dollars , leaving little for the men and women who help grow the nation ’ s food , fruits and nuts . That dichotomy has bred a mistrust of state government and a healthy skepticism of federal officials , Trump excepted .
How is it , the people here ask , that state and federal officials didn ’ t seem to have the money to properly fix the dam ’ s problems when they were first identified , but have seemingly untold millions available when the crisis finally arrived .
To understand the situation , you have to look more carefully at California ’ s voting tallies . Statewide , Hillary Clinton clobbered Trump , winning 61 % of the popular vote and 4.2 million more votes than Trump . On one hand , this is a state that utterly rejected Trump . On the other hand , because California is so big , there ’ s wide variation in political affiliations .
The farmers and ranchers of Butte County , surrounding Oroville , live vastly different lives than the millionaires strolling Santa Monica ’ s beaches or riding the Google buses to Mountain View or the Facebook coaches to Menlo Park . Butte County favored Trump in the election 46 % to 42 % , despite the presence of the more urban and traditionally more liberal Chico within its boundaries . Downstream neighbor Yuba County , home of Yuba City and Marysville , is perhaps a more accurate barometer : It went for Trump at nearly 58 % .
In this part of the state , Brown is the bad guy for picking fights with the president over immigration , climate change and national priorities . Trump , in turn , called California “ out of control ” and suggested he might try to withhold federal funding , particularly over whether the more liberal coastal cities were acting as sanctuaries for undocumented immigrants .
“ As you know , I ’ m very much opposed to sanctuary cities . They breed crime . There ’ s a lot of problems , ” Trump told Fox News host Bill O ’ Reilly . “ If we have to , we ’ ll defund . We give tremendous amounts of money to California . California in many ways is out of control , as you know . ”
Brown , for his part , has lauded Trump for promising to repair the nation ’ s roads , bridges and dams , but has also promised to use the state ’ s scientists , lawyers and resources to fight the president ’ s “ alternative facts . ”
The bad blood has flowed downstream , from the retired homebuilder who trusts Trump over the locally managed state Division of Water Resources , to the traffic flagger who laughs that liberal environmentalists aren ’ t worried about rare fish when their own homes are endangered , to the evacuee who refuses to return home or be quoted by name because she doesn ’ t trust what the government will do with the information .
Everyone here , it seems , has a reason to distrust some level of the government . Nowhere was that more evident than when a video showing a National Guard soldier giving out wrong information about the state of the dam and evacuation began ricocheting around social media hours after the evacuation order was lifted . What he said contradicted the official line from dam managers , and the public seemed ready to accept his version over theirs , especially as some Californians already believed dam managers had covered up the extent of repair work conducted in 2009 .
Dam managers say they ’ re making good progress on repairing the damage caused when the reservoir overtopped its emergency spillway , scouring away trees , dirt and boulders . Managers had feared the emergency spillway could collapse , sending a wall of water downstream . That threat has eased , and workers are now shoring up the spillway and removing debris from below the dam .
Still , social media has been filled with rampant rumors and speculation that government officials were misstating the risk for some political gain , and there ’ s skepticism bordering on paranoia that the “ real story ” isn ’ t being told by the media or the government .
“ We have this longstanding history in our country , based on the idea that people control the government , not the other way around , ” said Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea , who ordered the evacuation and then spent days defending it against critics on both sides of the aisle .
Wading into that political tension are the state and federal emergency-management agencies trying to help .
“ Basically , they ’ re like don ’ t mess with us . We don ’ t need you…until we need you , ” said Craig Fugate , the head of FEMA under President Obama . “ You have to understand that level of mistrust . It ’ s not personal . ”
Fugate said the political dynamic in California mirrors that of many states , from his native Florida to the urban-rural divide of Washington state . The Oroville Dam ’ s potential failure could have been the first major test of the relationship between Trump and outspoken critic Brown , who after opposing the president asked him to declare a disaster in Oroville .
Without addressing the conflict , Trump quickly approved the request via FEMA , freeing up potentially hundreds of millions of dollars and resources to pay for the repairs that are now disturbing Hofeling ’ s days and nights . Ballpark costs for repairs are set at $ 200 million .
“ I learned early on that all disasters are local , as all politics are local , ” Fugate said . “ You drop your logos and your egos at the door… this is not about you , this is not about your ego , your publicity . It ’ s about the people we are serving in a time of need . Because that need is a non-political need . ”
In Oroville , few people see it that way . Everyone gets run through the lens of politics . They ’ re mad about Brown ’ s election ( Gov . Moonbeam , they remind visitors ) , his plans for a high-speed train along the coast , and about the meddling of government in the ways they heat their homes , get their electricity and the kinds of cars they drive .
They feel the dam ’ s managers only respond to crises and only when they impact Democratic voters on the coast . And they ’ re heartened that Trump has vowed to rebuild the nation ’ s infrastructure — on Saturday night at a rally in Florida , he called upon Congress to pass a $ 1 trillion infrastructure package .
For the people beneath the dam , the fact that no Trump-Brown feud materialized is an example of the new president ’ s munificence . But they ’ re also well aware that things could have gone very differently here . “ It ’ s very frustrating , ” says 23-year police officer and Oroville resident Jeff Wiles , as he watched the emergency repair work with his son . “ It just irritates you . ”
Wiles worked several days straight during the evacuation as police officers , sheriff ’ s deputies and the California Highway Patrol emptied the Butte County Jail and then flooded the town with officers to prevent burglaries and looting . Wiles says he looks forward to retirement in a few years , so he can move his family , maybe to Idaho , to be among fellow conservatives . He ’ s tired , he says , of living in a state so split between Democrats and Republicans .
“ You tell the president , ‘ we don ’ t want anything to do with you , ’ and then you ask for help ? ” Wiles says . “ At least he ’ s not holding a grudge .

OROVILLE, Calif. — Eldon Hofeling raises his voice over the roar of backhoes, helicopters, tumbling rocks, dump trucks and 750,000 gallons of water rushing past every second.

“It’s driving me nuts,” he says.

“Very important for the nation to hear @potus describe events in #Charlottesville for what they are, a terror attack by #whitesupremacists,” tweeted Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.

Another Florida Republican, Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, tweeted that

""White supremacists, Neo-Nazis and anti-Semites are the antithesis of our American values. There are no other ‘sides’ to hatred and bigotry.”

""We should call evil by its name,"" tweeted Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch. ""My brother didn't give his life fighting Hitler for Nazi ideas to go unchallenged here at home.""

South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott tweeted: ""Domestic terror in #Charlottesville must be condemned by every.single.one.of.us . Otherwise hate is simply emboldened.""

U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, posted a Facebook statement that said, in part:

""The Nazis, the KKK, and white supremacists are repulsive and evil, and all of us have a moral obligation to speak out against the lies, bigotry, anti-Semitism, and hatred that they propagate.

""Having watched the horrifying video of the car deliberately crashing into a crowd of protesters, I urge the Department of Justice to immediately investigate and prosecute this grotesque act of domestic terrorism.""

Later Saturday, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that a federal civil rights investigation would be launched into the fatal car incident in Charlottesville that authorities said left one woman dead and 19 other people injured.

U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., alluded to President Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address in his statement.

“Our Founders fought a revolution for the idea that all men are created equal,"" McCain wrote. ""The heirs of that revolution fought a Civil War to save our nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to that revolutionary proposition.”

Ohio Gov. John Kasich issued a series of tweets condemning Saturday's violence.

""This violence and hate must stop,"" Kasich wrote in one message.

Speaking at his New Jersey golf club, Trump condemned the “egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence” in Charlottesville, Virginia, where white nationalists upset over the removal of a Robert E. Lee statue violently clashed with counter-protesters.

TRUMP CONDEMNS ‘EGREGIOUS DISPLAY OF HATRED, BIGOTRY AND VIOLENCE’

On Saturday evening, a White House aide issued a statement clarifying why the president used the phrase ""on many sides.”

“The president was condemning hatred, bigotry and violence from all sources and all sides,” a White House official said. “There was violence between protesters and counter protesters today.”",www.foxnews.com,right,KM1kADKFhfT67vye

That ’ s what the president ’ s adviser told Robert Kuttner over at the American Prospect . “ The Democrats , ” he said , “ the longer they talk about identity politics , I got ’ em . I want them to talk about racism every day . If the left is focused on race and identity , and we go with economic nationalism , we can crush the Democrats . ”
The argument invokes a question that picked up steam after the 2016 election : Either Trump ’ s election was a rejection of identity politics or his election was a validation of the prominence of identity politics in the US .
Whichever you believe , there are very different implications on how the country — and especially the Democratic Party — should move forward . Should the emphasis be on finally addressing America ’ s long history of systemic racism , going from slavery to the criminal justice system ? Or is the more pressing issue the massively corrupt , unequal economic and financial system that benefits the top 1 percent far more than the rest of the nation , regardless of race ?
On one hand , some people say that America needs to continue discussing and fighting on all of the issues relevant to identity politics — racism in the criminal justice system , if gay people should be protected from discrimination , whether transgender people should be allowed to use the bathroom that aligns with their gender identity , and so on . With some progress made on these issues in the past few years , advocates say that it ’ s too late to abandon them now . And Trump ’ s election creates a new sense of urgency to discuss these issues , because he ’ s so at odds with many of the ideals promoted by the left in discussions about identity .
On the other hand , some people , particularly on the left and now Bannon , argue that identity politics have served as a distraction from issues they view as more important and politically palatable — the growing income gap between the rich and everyone else , the shipping of jobs overseas , and the abuse and corruption in America ’ s financial system . By focusing so much on issues of identity , the argument goes , Democrats and liberals surrendered all of these issues to Trump , letting him tap into an economically populist message that drew in enough of white rural and working-class America to seal his victory .
But both of these explanations of the election have problems . They simplify and obfuscate what actually happened on Election Day . ( For one , it ’ s unclear if Trump really is pursuing any sort of economic agenda , given that he ’ s passed no major bills . ) They also tend to create a potentially false either-or scenario ; it really may be possible to talk about economic and identity issues at the same time .
And most importantly , this debate has been far too narrow . It typically looks at what liberals and Democrats have been doing , particularly in the past few months . But it doesn ’ t pay much attention to how Republicans and conservatives have leveraged identity politics for decades , pushing minority groups and women to demand that the opposing political party and liberals finally fight back . Bannon ’ s comments , in fact , speak to exactly how Republicans have embraced identity politics — to turn white Americans against Democrats .
“ Identity politics ” is a very vague phrase , but it generally refers to the discussion of and politicking around issues pertaining to one ’ s , well , identity . The focus typically falls on women , racial minorities , immigrants , LGBTQ people , and religious minorities , such as Muslim Americans . All the social issues you may have heard of in the past several years — same-sex marriage , police shootings of unarmed black men , trans people in bathrooms , the fluidity of gender , discussions about rape culture , campus battles about safe spaces and trigger warnings — are typically the kinds of issues people mean when they refer to identity politics .
There ’ s another side to identity politics that you hear less about in the US , particularly white identity . This is by definition an identity , but it ’ s one that ’ s so widely assumed to be the norm in America that issues pertaining to white identity are typically not regarded as identity politics .
But it is a huge part of identity — and American — politics nonetheless . In one recent study of the 2016 election , UC Santa Barbara and Stanford University researchers told white voters that minority groups would outnumber white people in the US by 2042 . They found that voters who strongly identified as white became significantly more likely to support Trump after they were reminded of the country ’ s shifting racial demographics .
The conclusion is clear : White identity and issues surrounding it can play a big role in electoral outcomes . That helps explain why Trump won : All his dog whistles about making America great again ( by perhaps reverting to a time when white people held a much stronger grip of government ) , political correctness , immigrants , Muslims , and “ the African Americans ” may have helped prime white people into voting for the racially regressive candidate . ( There ’ s a lot more research backing this priming effect , which Dylan Matthews broke down for ███ . )
It ’ s important to understand this to understand how identity politics works . It ’ s a two-sided debate : One side wants to preserve a status quo that has historically protected a white identity that many white , straight , cisgender ( non-trans ) , Christian Americans identify with . The other side wants to carve out an opening for other groups to be more accepted in mainstream America : black people , Latino immigrants , LGBTQ individuals , and Muslim Americans , to name a few .
Notably , this debate is not new . While the term “ identity politics ” rose to prominence in the past few years , it is really a broader national conversation that has been going on since the country was founded . Every single step in the push to end systemic racism — from the abolition of slavery to the civil rights movement to Black Lives Matter — was and is part of what ’ s now known as identity politics today . This historical push-and-pull has been at the heart of US politics forever , leading the country to establish the odd system with which we elect our presidents , fight a civil war , pass its first federal anti-terrorism law to fight the KKK , and take 220 years to elect its first black president .
“ Class has always been racially determined in this country , ” Heather McGhee , president of the left-leaning public policy group Demos , told me . “ In a country where you can have a credo of equality and social mobility and the ability of any man to rise as far as his talents and drive can take him , that has always had to be put in relative terms . ”
Conservatives have long been tapping into this fact of American life by combining identity politics with their other messages . Before Trump , there was the Southern strategy championed by Richard Nixon — in which Nixon tapped into white Americans ’ racial resentment of the civil rights era to begin flipping white Southern voters from Democrats to Republicans . This continued through coded rhetoric about “ welfare queens ” and other dog whistles that suggest that big government is really a tool to help minority people at the expense , through higher taxes , of white working people . ( Never mind that the plurality of food stamp recipients are white . )
This strategy has been baked into Republican politics since then . Trump was “ the culmination , ” McGhee said , by bringing together an explicitly racist message and a conservative economic message focused on repealing Obamacare , slashing entitlement programs , and cutting taxes . Again , these weren ’ t exclusive messages — they played to white rural Americans ’ sentiment , as captured by Arlie Hochschild ’ s Strangers in Their Own Land : Anger and Mourning on the American Right , that big government tax-and-spend programs are simply a means to take from them and give to other groups .
Obviously , not all people who oppose some or all entitlement programs do so on racist grounds . There are economic , budgetary , and philosophical arguments against how entitlement programs work today . But racial attitudes are a motive for a lot of people , based on Hochschild ’ s work and many studies .
Modern liberal identity politics is in large part a reaction to this US history and attitudes surrounding race . After centuries of what many people justifiably see as oppression , they think it ’ s time the country has an open conversation about what has been going wrong all this time and how the country can move forward to be more tolerant and accepting of a diverse population . So they have pushed Democrats , who used to take a more conservative tone on race ( see : President Bill Clinton ’ s “ tough on crime ” rhetoric and policies ) or stay largely quiet about race ( see : President Barack Obama ) , to speak more strongly about identity issues .
Sometimes the push to change the conversation can come off clumsily . There are many examples of students on college campuses acting out in ways that many people perceive as ridiculous — by , say , trying to ban speakers with different views or policing language . These kinds of stories are often dismissed as political correctness run amok .
But whatever you make of those stories , they are only a small part of identity politics . The bigger battle isn ’ t about restricting speech on college campuses , but who exactly is accepted in America .
At the crux of both sides of identity politics is a simple problem : No one wants to get left behind .
Minority groups and women don ’ t want to go back to a day where it was legal for employers and businesses to discriminate against them . In fact , they want to move past the progress that ’ s already been made and solve other problems — such as the vast racial gaps in economic and educational attainment , the racial disparities in the criminal justice system , and the gender wage gap .
But many white Americans , especially those in rural and Rust Belt areas hit hard by globalization , see identity politics as a zero-sum game , one in which they will lose out more and more as minority groups make gains .
Hochschild , a sociologist and author of Strangers in Their Own Land , provided an apt analogy for many white Americans ’ feeling of neglect : As they see it , they are all in this line toward a hill with prosperity at the top . But over the past few years , globalization and income stagnation have caused the line to stop moving . And from their perspective , other groups — black and brown Americans , women — are now cutting in the line , because they ’ re getting new ( and more equal ) opportunities through new anti-discrimination laws and policies like affirmative action .
In addition to this , many white Americans feel like they can ’ t even talk about how they feel due to what they call “ political correctness. ” Michelle Goldberg , a columnist at Slate who ’ s interviewed dozens of people at Trump rallies , wrote that she consistently heard this from Trump supporters : “ Again and again , people told me how much they resented not being able to speak their minds , though none of them wanted to articulate what exactly they were holding in . They said they hated being shamed on social media , though they usually didn ’ t want to say what they had been shamed for . ”
The undertone here is that a lot of Trump supporters want to be able to say racist , sexist , or otherwise bigoted things without consequence .
But another possibility is that these people want to be able to speak about issues — sometimes in a clumsy , accidentally offensive way , because they just don ’ t know the new language for these topics — without being shamed . Writing them off as simply racist , sexist , or otherwise bigoted only makes them feel like their actual concerns about the economy , state of the country , size of government , and so on are going ignored . To these people , political correctness — and identity politics more broadly — have , in their view , oppressed them .
Historically , however , identity politics has been used to oppress not white people but people of color . The Southern strategy gave way to administrations that passed “ tough on crime ” laws , weakened the enforcement of civil rights laws , enacted legislation that suppresses voters , opposed same-sex marriage and nondiscrimination laws that legally protect LGBTQ people , and took on other actions that targeted or disproportionately hurt minority Americans and women . These kinds of policies are why we see such big gaps in all kinds of outcomes , from the gender wage gap to white versus black life expectancy .
These outcomes , in fact , are why identity politics is big today . The current movement is a reaction to decades of oppressive policies and inequality , with people now trying to change how US society and politics talk about and handle these issues to hopefully push the country in a more equal direction . It ’ s not that people suddenly decided to proactively bring up these issues that never existed before ; it ’ s that they ’ re fed up and want the current circumstances to change .
Take , for instance , how transgender writer Julia Serano put it : “ I would * love * to stop talking about being transgender . It would be absolutely wonderful to live in a world where I didn ’ t have to constantly consider that aspect of my person . But you know what ? I don ’ t have the privilege of not thinking about it , because there are shit-tons of people out there who hate me , harass me , and who wish to criminalize and silence me * because * I ’ m transgender . ”
Democrats need to find a way to balance their message
For Democrats , the issue now is finding a way to balance identity politics with other issues .
Trump won the election , as has now been well-established , by convincing white working-class voters to back him much more than they backed the previous Republican candidate , Mitt Romney . The shift was enough to overcome the demographic changes — mainly , the growth of Latino voters — that have benefited Democrats over the past few years .
It ’ s not just presidential politics , either . Democrats ’ struggles to connect to the white working class have contributed to the party ’ s losses down the ballot , leaving it with no control of any level of government in America come 2017 .
Democrats don ’ t want to see this trend continue . So they want to find a way to speak to the white working class to avoid even more of them from going to Republicans . But they also feel like they can ’ t stop talking about identity politics altogether , given that much of the current Democratic base is made up of millennials , people of color , and women who really care about these issues .
The closest thing to a consensus so far seems to be that Democrats need to advance a more economically populist message — one that decries the excesses of Wall Street and pushes policy ideas that could benefit the white working class along with the rest of Americans , like universal health care , free college , paid family leave , and a massive infrastructure program .
This is what key Democratic leaders have said in the aftermath of the election : Sen. Bernie Sanders argued that the party should signal that it will help all working class people regardless of race . And Sen. Elizabeth Warren reportedly told donors , according to Gabriel Debenedetti at Politico , that “ Democrats need to step up their economic appeal to everyday voters . ”
Beyond that , there ’ s basically no consensus . Some people suggest that Democrats should abandon identity politics altogether as part of taking up a populist message . Others argue that it ’ s possible for the party to balance both identity politics and a more economically populist message . ( No one I ’ ve talked to in my reporting since the election has suggested that the party should change nothing or follow a solely identity politics–focused message . )
This debate is essentially an extension of one that became much more prominent during the Democratic primary . Back then , some leftists , many of whom supported Sanders , argued that Democrats need to focus more on issues pertaining to class through an economically populist message . But some liberals , many of whom backed Hillary Clinton , said that the party must excite its diverse coalition by speaking to identity issues . Now that Democrats lost to Trump , this debate has continued after the election .
Mark Lilla , a liberal historian who wrote “ The End of Identity Liberalism ” in the New York Times after the election , argues that the party ’ s messaging on identity politics has ostracized white Americans — many of whom would otherwise be receptive to the party ’ s economic policies .
Hillary Clinton was at her best and most uplifting when she spoke about American interests in world affairs and how they relate to our understanding of democracy . But when it came to life at home , she tended on the campaign trail to lose that large vision and slip into the rhetoric of diversity , calling out explicitly to African-American , Latino , L.G.B.T . and women voters at every stop . This was a strategic mistake . If you are going to mention groups in America , you had better mention all of them . If you don ’ t , those left out will notice and feel excluded .
“ It ’ s crucial to develop a message that focuses on what we share , ” Lilla told me . “ Not on our identities at all , but what we share about certain principles in this country . ”
Lilla argued that it is not that he doesn ’ t care about identity politics issues . He said , for one , that he supports many of the efforts to expand and protect LGBTQ rights . But he argued that Democrats are going to be unable to do the work to expand and protect minority groups and women ’ s rights if Democratic lawmakers are not in power first .
“ It ’ s an argument about strategy . It ’ s not an argument about ultimate values , ” Lilla said . “ It ’ s my attempt to get liberals ’ attention and even progressives ’ attention focused on winning elections. ” He added , “ You can do nothing to protect black motorists [ pulled over by police ] and gay couples walking hand-in-hand down the street if you don ’ t control Congress and , most importantly , if you don ’ t have a voice in state legislatures . ”
There ’ s some evidence behind Lilla ’ s argument : The research , as noted above , shows white people are more likely to vote through their white identity if they are primed to think of an election in racial terms . And other research on what sociologists call “ white fragility ” has found that when many white people are asked to answer for potential racism , they become immediately defensive — pushing them into denial that they ’ ve done anything wrong and , in some cases , hardening their racist attitudes . ( Much more on that in a previous piece I wrote about this research . )
So it stands to reason that the more Democrats push on identity issues , the more white Americans will be primed into voting as a racial group — and potentially for Republicans in what they view as racial self-preservation .
But it ’ s not just Democrats who have been raising these issues for the past few years . The whole point of the Southern strategy and dog whistles is to acknowledge and wink at these issues for white voters . After all , Trump is arguably the candidate who made the election in large part about race and identity ; he ’ s the one who called Mexican immigrants “ rapists ” in his first campaign event , proposed a ban on Muslims coming into the US , and described places where black people live as hellish nightmares .
Much of Hillary Clinton ’ s messaging was a reaction to this , and it ’ s hard to see her trying the same kind of messaging against a Republican like Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio . But once Trump got started , she couldn ’ t just ignore what was going on , and she had to speak about identity issues to some degree . Still , whether that required a message that microtargeted specific minority groups is a matter of debate .
A shift to appealing to white voters could leave behind people of color
For minority groups , there ’ s a big risk to Democrats simply ignoring identity politics in favor of appealing to the white working class : When progressive parties felt compelled to reach out to white voters in such a way in the past , they neglected people of color in both rhetorical and policy terms .
New Yorker writer James Surowiecki gave a few examples in a series of tweets : when Republicans abandoned Reconstruction following the abolition of slavery , leaving black people to “ fend for themselves ” in the South ; during the New Deal , when Democrats excluded predominantly black farmers and service workers from Social Security ; and in the 1990s , when the Clinton administration and Democrats embraced “ tough on crime ” and anti-welfare rhetoric that led to policies that disproportionately hurt people of color .
Paul Frymer , director of the Program in Law and Public Affairs at Princeton University , told me that it ’ s possible this will happen again . Democrats could make the cold calculation that even if they neglect identity issues , people of color and other marginalized groups will have nowhere else to go , since they certainly can ’ t go to a Republican Party with a history of standing against civil rights legislation , criminal justice reform , and immigration reform .
Democrats look at Republicans ’ wins with the white vote and “ think two things . One , they think it ’ s a critical vote , which it is , ” Frymer said . “ And two , they think , where are African Americans going to go ? Latinos to a certain extent have a little more room to maneuver — and Latinos are much more diverse , from Cubans to Puerto Ricans and so forth . But I think the Democrats think the strategy they use — appeal to this white majority and rally minority voters on Election Day by getting them out to vote — has been sufficient . ”
McGhee of Demos , however , argued that the idea that Democrats should abandon identity politics and , therefore , potentially people of color for economic populism presents a false either-or scenario . She said that it ’ s possible for Democrats to talk about economic issues that affect people of all backgrounds while speaking to issues that affect people of color in particular . In fact , she said it could be possible to bring both of these issues together .
For example , Democrats could speak to how conservatives have leveraged identity politics in a way that ’ s also hurt white Americans . As McGhee put it , conservative politicians have used race to rile up their constituents on cultural issues while ignoring or even working against causes that would benefit their constituents . “ The racial narrative has been the weapon , ” she said , to get white Americans to vote for policies that go against their interests .
Consider , for example , that the Trump administration and Republican Congress have worked ( so far unsuccessfully ) to repeal Obamacare and slash entitlement programs , which would send potentially millions of white working-class Americans into poverty and rob millions of their health insurance . This would be a complete disaster for the group of people who overwhelmingly voted for Trump , even if many of them thought they were voting for their own preservation .
By communicating this kind of issue , McGhee says that Democrats can condemn racist rhetoric like Trump ’ s and signal to white voters that hateful rhetoric like Trump ’ s only masks policies that will actually hurt them .
Whether McGhee ’ s idea works remains to be seen . But it ’ s the kind of idea that Democrats will need to consider as they look for a way to balance outreach to white voters , a serious response to decades of conservative identity politics , and the many competing interests within their party .","Steve Bannon thinks identity politics are great for President Donald Trump.

That’s what the president’s adviser told Robert Kuttner over at the American Prospect. “The Democrats,” he said, “the longer they talk about identity politics, I got ’em. I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.”

The argument invokes a question that picked up steam after the 2016 election: Either Trump’s election was a rejection of identity politics or his election was a validation of the prominence of identity politics in the US.

Whichever you believe, there are very different implications on how the country — and especially the Democratic Party — should move forward. Should the emphasis be on finally addressing America’s long history of systemic racism, going from slavery to the criminal justice system? Or is the more pressing issue the massively corrupt, unequal economic and financial system that benefits the top 1 percent far more than the rest of the nation, regardless of race?

On one hand, some people say that America needs to continue discussing and fighting on all of the issues relevant to identity politics — racism in the criminal justice system, if gay people should be protected from discrimination, whether transgender people should be allowed to use the bathroom that aligns with their gender identity, and so on. With some progress made on these issues in the past few years, advocates say that it’s too late to abandon them now. And Trump’s election creates a new sense of urgency to discuss these issues, because he’s so at odds with many of the ideals promoted by the left in discussions about identity.

On the other hand, some people, particularly on the left and now Bannon, argue that identity politics have served as a distraction from issues they view as more important and politically palatable — the growing income gap between the rich and everyone else, the shipping of jobs overseas, and the abuse and corruption in America’s financial system. By focusing so much on issues of identity, the argument goes, Democrats and liberals surrendered all of these issues to Trump, letting him tap into an economically populist message that drew in enough of white rural and working-class America to seal his victory.

But both of these explanations of the election have problems. They simplify and obfuscate what actually happened on Election Day. (For one, it’s unclear if Trump really is pursuing any sort of economic agenda, given that he’s passed no major bills.) They also tend to create a potentially false either-or scenario; it really may be possible to talk about economic and identity issues at the same time.

And most importantly, this debate has been far too narrow. It typically looks at what liberals and Democrats have been doing, particularly in the past few months. But it doesn’t pay much attention to how Republicans and conservatives have leveraged identity politics for decades, pushing minority groups and women to demand that the opposing political party and liberals finally fight back. Bannon’s comments, in fact, speak to exactly how Republicans have embraced identity politics — to turn white Americans against Democrats.

Identity politics is American politics

“Identity politics” is a very vague phrase, but it generally refers to the discussion of and politicking around issues pertaining to one’s, well, identity. The focus typically falls on women, racial minorities, immigrants, LGBTQ people, and religious minorities, such as Muslim Americans. All the social issues you may have heard of in the past several years — same-sex marriage, police shootings of unarmed black men, trans people in bathrooms, the fluidity of gender, discussions about rape culture, campus battles about safe spaces and trigger warnings — are typically the kinds of issues people mean when they refer to identity politics.

There’s another side to identity politics that you hear less about in the US, particularly white identity. This is by definition an identity, but it’s one that’s so widely assumed to be the norm in America that issues pertaining to white identity are typically not regarded as identity politics.

But it is a huge part of identity — and American — politics nonetheless. In one recent study of the 2016 election, UC Santa Barbara and Stanford University researchers told white voters that minority groups would outnumber white people in the US by 2042. They found that voters who strongly identified as white became significantly more likely to support Trump after they were reminded of the country’s shifting racial demographics.

The conclusion is clear: White identity and issues surrounding it can play a big role in electoral outcomes. That helps explain why Trump won: All his dog whistles about making America great again (by perhaps reverting to a time when white people held a much stronger grip of government), political correctness, immigrants, Muslims, and “the African Americans” may have helped prime white people into voting for the racially regressive candidate. (There’s a lot more research backing this priming effect, which Dylan Matthews broke down for Vox.)

It’s important to understand this to understand how identity politics works. It’s a two-sided debate: One side wants to preserve a status quo that has historically protected a white identity that many white, straight, cisgender (non-trans), Christian Americans identify with. The other side wants to carve out an opening for other groups to be more accepted in mainstream America: black people, Latino immigrants, LGBTQ individuals, and Muslim Americans, to name a few.

Notably, this debate is not new. While the term “identity politics” rose to prominence in the past few years, it is really a broader national conversation that has been going on since the country was founded. Every single step in the push to end systemic racism — from the abolition of slavery to the civil rights movement to Black Lives Matter — was and is part of what’s now known as identity politics today. This historical push-and-pull has been at the heart of US politics forever, leading the country to establish the odd system with which we elect our presidents, fight a civil war, pass its first federal anti-terrorism law to fight the KKK, and take 220 years to elect its first black president.

“Class has always been racially determined in this country,” Heather McGhee, president of the left-leaning public policy group Demos, told me. “In a country where you can have a credo of equality and social mobility and the ability of any man to rise as far as his talents and drive can take him, that has always had to be put in relative terms.”

Conservatives have long been tapping into this fact of American life by combining identity politics with their other messages. Before Trump, there was the Southern strategy championed by Richard Nixon — in which Nixon tapped into white Americans’ racial resentment of the civil rights era to begin flipping white Southern voters from Democrats to Republicans. This continued through coded rhetoric about “welfare queens” and other dog whistles that suggest that big government is really a tool to help minority people at the expense, through higher taxes, of white working people. (Never mind that the plurality of food stamp recipients are white.)

This strategy has been baked into Republican politics since then. Trump was “the culmination,” McGhee said, by bringing together an explicitly racist message and a conservative economic message focused on repealing Obamacare, slashing entitlement programs, and cutting taxes. Again, these weren’t exclusive messages — they played to white rural Americans’ sentiment, as captured by Arlie Hochschild’s Strangers in Their Own Land: Anger and Mourning on the American Right, that big government tax-and-spend programs are simply a means to take from them and give to other groups.

Obviously, not all people who oppose some or all entitlement programs do so on racist grounds. There are economic, budgetary, and philosophical arguments against how entitlement programs work today. But racial attitudes are a motive for a lot of people, based on Hochschild’s work and many studies.

Modern liberal identity politics is in large part a reaction to this US history and attitudes surrounding race. After centuries of what many people justifiably see as oppression, they think it’s time the country has an open conversation about what has been going wrong all this time and how the country can move forward to be more tolerant and accepting of a diverse population. So they have pushed Democrats, who used to take a more conservative tone on race (see: President Bill Clinton’s “tough on crime” rhetoric and policies) or stay largely quiet about race (see: President Barack Obama), to speak more strongly about identity issues.

Sometimes the push to change the conversation can come off clumsily. There are many examples of students on college campuses acting out in ways that many people perceive as ridiculous — by, say, trying to ban speakers with different views or policing language. These kinds of stories are often dismissed as political correctness run amok.

But whatever you make of those stories, they are only a small part of identity politics. The bigger battle isn’t about restricting speech on college campuses, but who exactly is accepted in America.

People don’t want to get left behind

At the crux of both sides of identity politics is a simple problem: No one wants to get left behind.

Minority groups and women don’t want to go back to a day where it was legal for employers and businesses to discriminate against them. In fact, they want to move past the progress that’s already been made and solve other problems — such as the vast racial gaps in economic and educational attainment, the racial disparities in the criminal justice system, and the gender wage gap.

But many white Americans, especially those in rural and Rust Belt areas hit hard by globalization, see identity politics as a zero-sum game, one in which they will lose out more and more as minority groups make gains.

Hochschild, a sociologist and author of Strangers in Their Own Land, provided an apt analogy for many white Americans’ feeling of neglect: As they see it, they are all in this line toward a hill with prosperity at the top. But over the past few years, globalization and income stagnation have caused the line to stop moving. And from their perspective, other groups — black and brown Americans, women — are now cutting in the line, because they’re getting new (and more equal) opportunities through new anti-discrimination laws and policies like affirmative action.

In addition to this, many white Americans feel like they can’t even talk about how they feel due to what they call “political correctness.” Michelle Goldberg, a columnist at Slate who’s interviewed dozens of people at Trump rallies, wrote that she consistently heard this from Trump supporters: “Again and again, people told me how much they resented not being able to speak their minds, though none of them wanted to articulate what exactly they were holding in. They said they hated being shamed on social media, though they usually didn’t want to say what they had been shamed for.”

The undertone here is that a lot of Trump supporters want to be able to say racist, sexist, or otherwise bigoted things without consequence.

But another possibility is that these people want to be able to speak about issues — sometimes in a clumsy, accidentally offensive way, because they just don’t know the new language for these topics — without being shamed. Writing them off as simply racist, sexist, or otherwise bigoted only makes them feel like their actual concerns about the economy, state of the country, size of government, and so on are going ignored. To these people, political correctness — and identity politics more broadly — have, in their view, oppressed them.

Historically, however, identity politics has been used to oppress not white people but people of color. The Southern strategy gave way to administrations that passed “tough on crime” laws, weakened the enforcement of civil rights laws, enacted legislation that suppresses voters, opposed same-sex marriage and nondiscrimination laws that legally protect LGBTQ people, and took on other actions that targeted or disproportionately hurt minority Americans and women. These kinds of policies are why we see such big gaps in all kinds of outcomes, from the gender wage gap to white versus black life expectancy.

These outcomes, in fact, are why identity politics is big today. The current movement is a reaction to decades of oppressive policies and inequality, with people now trying to change how US society and politics talk about and handle these issues to hopefully push the country in a more equal direction. It’s not that people suddenly decided to proactively bring up these issues that never existed before; it’s that they’re fed up and want the current circumstances to change.

Take, for instance, how transgender writer Julia Serano put it: “I would *love* to stop talking about being transgender. It would be absolutely wonderful to live in a world where I didn’t have to constantly consider that aspect of my person. But you know what? I don’t have the privilege of not thinking about it, because there are shit-tons of people out there who hate me, harass me, and who wish to criminalize and silence me *because* I’m transgender.”

Democrats need to find a way to balance their message

For Democrats, the issue now is finding a way to balance identity politics with other issues.

Trump won the election, as has now been well-established, by convincing white working-class voters to back him much more than they backed the previous Republican candidate, Mitt Romney. The shift was enough to overcome the demographic changes — mainly, the growth of Latino voters — that have benefited Democrats over the past few years.

It’s not just presidential politics, either. Democrats’ struggles to connect to the white working class have contributed to the party’s losses down the ballot, leaving it with no control of any level of government in America come 2017.

Democrats don’t want to see this trend continue. So they want to find a way to speak to the white working class to avoid even more of them from going to Republicans. But they also feel like they can’t stop talking about identity politics altogether, given that much of the current Democratic base is made up of millennials, people of color, and women who really care about these issues.

The closest thing to a consensus so far seems to be that Democrats need to advance a more economically populist message — one that decries the excesses of Wall Street and pushes policy ideas that could benefit the white working class along with the rest of Americans, like universal health care, free college, paid family leave, and a massive infrastructure program.

This is what key Democratic leaders have said in the aftermath of the election: Sen. Bernie Sanders argued that the party should signal that it will help all working class people regardless of race. And Sen. Elizabeth Warren reportedly told donors, according to Gabriel Debenedetti at Politico, that “Democrats need to step up their economic appeal to everyday voters.”

Beyond that, there’s basically no consensus. Some people suggest that Democrats should abandon identity politics altogether as part of taking up a populist message. Others argue that it’s possible for the party to balance both identity politics and a more economically populist message. (No one I’ve talked to in my reporting since the election has suggested that the party should change nothing or follow a solely identity politics–focused message.)

This debate is essentially an extension of one that became much more prominent during the Democratic primary. Back then, some leftists, many of whom supported Sanders, argued that Democrats need to focus more on issues pertaining to class through an economically populist message. But some liberals, many of whom backed Hillary Clinton, said that the party must excite its diverse coalition by speaking to identity issues. Now that Democrats lost to Trump, this debate has continued after the election.

One side wants an end to “identity liberalism”

Mark Lilla, a liberal historian who wrote “The End of Identity Liberalism” in the New York Times after the election, argues that the party’s messaging on identity politics has ostracized white Americans — many of whom would otherwise be receptive to the party’s economic policies.

He wrote:

Hillary Clinton was at her best and most uplifting when she spoke about American interests in world affairs and how they relate to our understanding of democracy. But when it came to life at home, she tended on the campaign trail to lose that large vision and slip into the rhetoric of diversity, calling out explicitly to African-American, Latino, L.G.B.T. and women voters at every stop. This was a strategic mistake. If you are going to mention groups in America, you had better mention all of them. If you don’t, those left out will notice and feel excluded.

“It’s crucial to develop a message that focuses on what we share,” Lilla told me. “Not on our identities at all, but what we share about certain principles in this country.”

Lilla argued that it is not that he doesn’t care about identity politics issues. He said, for one, that he supports many of the efforts to expand and protect LGBTQ rights. But he argued that Democrats are going to be unable to do the work to expand and protect minority groups and women’s rights if Democratic lawmakers are not in power first.

“It’s an argument about strategy. It’s not an argument about ultimate values,” Lilla said. “It’s my attempt to get liberals’ attention and even progressives’ attention focused on winning elections.” He added, “You can do nothing to protect black motorists [pulled over by police] and gay couples walking hand-in-hand down the street if you don’t control Congress and, most importantly, if you don’t have a voice in state legislatures.”

There’s some evidence behind Lilla’s argument: The research, as noted above, shows white people are more likely to vote through their white identity if they are primed to think of an election in racial terms. And other research on what sociologists call “white fragility” has found that when many white people are asked to answer for potential racism, they become immediately defensive — pushing them into denial that they’ve done anything wrong and, in some cases, hardening their racist attitudes. (Much more on that in a previous piece I wrote about this research.)

So it stands to reason that the more Democrats push on identity issues, the more white Americans will be primed into voting as a racial group — and potentially for Republicans in what they view as racial self-preservation.

But it’s not just Democrats who have been raising these issues for the past few years. The whole point of the Southern strategy and dog whistles is to acknowledge and wink at these issues for white voters. After all, Trump is arguably the candidate who made the election in large part about race and identity; he’s the one who called Mexican immigrants “rapists” in his first campaign event, proposed a ban on Muslims coming into the US, and described places where black people live as hellish nightmares.

Much of Hillary Clinton’s messaging was a reaction to this, and it’s hard to see her trying the same kind of messaging against a Republican like Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio. But once Trump got started, she couldn’t just ignore what was going on, and she had to speak about identity issues to some degree. Still, whether that required a message that microtargeted specific minority groups is a matter of debate.

A shift to appealing to white voters could leave behind people of color

For minority groups, there’s a big risk to Democrats simply ignoring identity politics in favor of appealing to the white working class: When progressive parties felt compelled to reach out to white voters in such a way in the past, they neglected people of color in both rhetorical and policy terms.

New Yorker writer James Surowiecki gave a few examples in a series of tweets: when Republicans abandoned Reconstruction following the abolition of slavery, leaving black people to “fend for themselves” in the South; during the New Deal, when Democrats excluded predominantly black farmers and service workers from Social Security; and in the 1990s, when the Clinton administration and Democrats embraced “tough on crime” and anti-welfare rhetoric that led to policies that disproportionately hurt people of color.

Paul Frymer, director of the Program in Law and Public Affairs at Princeton University, told me that it’s possible this will happen again. Democrats could make the cold calculation that even if they neglect identity issues, people of color and other marginalized groups will have nowhere else to go, since they certainly can’t go to a Republican Party with a history of standing against civil rights legislation, criminal justice reform, and immigration reform.

Democrats look at Republicans’ wins with the white vote and “think two things. One, they think it’s a critical vote, which it is,” Frymer said. “And two, they think, where are African Americans going to go? Latinos to a certain extent have a little more room to maneuver — and Latinos are much more diverse, from Cubans to Puerto Ricans and so forth. But I think the Democrats think the strategy they use — appeal to this white majority and rally minority voters on Election Day by getting them out to vote — has been sufficient.”

McGhee of Demos, however, argued that the idea that Democrats should abandon identity politics and, therefore, potentially people of color for economic populism presents a false either-or scenario. She said that it’s possible for Democrats to talk about economic issues that affect people of all backgrounds while speaking to issues that affect people of color in particular. In fact, she said it could be possible to bring both of these issues together.

For example, Democrats could speak to how conservatives have leveraged identity politics in a way that’s also hurt white Americans. As McGhee put it, conservative politicians have used race to rile up their constituents on cultural issues while ignoring or even working against causes that would benefit their constituents. “The racial narrative has been the weapon,” she said, to get white Americans to vote for policies that go against their interests.

Consider, for example, that the Trump administration and Republican Congress have worked (so far unsuccessfully) to repeal Obamacare and slash entitlement programs, which would send potentially millions of white working-class Americans into poverty and rob millions of their health insurance. This would be a complete disaster for the group of people who overwhelmingly voted for Trump, even if many of them thought they were voting for their own preservation.

By communicating this kind of issue, McGhee says that Democrats can condemn racist rhetoric like Trump’s and signal to white voters that hateful rhetoric like Trump’s only masks policies that will actually hurt them.

Whether McGhee’s idea works remains to be seen. But it’s the kind of idea that Democrats will need to consider as they look for a way to balance outreach to white voters, a serious response to decades of conservative identity politics, and the many competing interests within their party.",www.vox.com,left,uyLPGoNdJW7uwofG

In this same era , a series of global financial shocks , from the dot-com bust to the more radical 2008 near–financial meltdown , reflected a radical ongoing restructuring in American middle-class life , characterized by stagnant net income , family disintegration , and eroding consumer confidence .

They could purchase big screens for a fraction of what their grandparents paid for black-and-white televisions and with a computer be entertained just as well cocooning in their basement as by going out to a concert , movie , or football game .
But such electronic narcotics did not hide the fact that in terms of economics the lifestyles of their ancestors were eroding . The new normal was two parents at work , none at home ; renting as often as buying ; an eight-year rather than three-year car loan ; fewer grandparents around the corner for babysitting or to assist when ill ; and consumer service defined as hearing taped messages of an hour before reaching a helper in India or Vietnam .

On the one hand , campuses competed for scarcer students by styling themselves as Club Med–type resorts with costly upscale dorms , tony student-union centers , lavish gyms , and an array of in loco parentis social services . The net effect was to make colleges responsible not so much for education , but more for shielding now-fragile youth from the supposed reactionary forces that would buffet them after graduation .
History became a melodramatic game of finding sinners and saints , rather than shared tragedy . Standards fell to accommodate poorly prepared incoming students .
But if campus materialism was at odds with classroom socialism , few seemed to notice . Instead , the idea grew up that one had no need to follow concretely the consequences of his abstract ideology . Or even worse , one ’ s hard-left politics — the louder and more strident the better — became a psychological means of squaring the circle of denouncing the West while being affluent and enjoying the material comforts of the good life .
Universities grew not just increasingly left-wing but far more intolerant than they were during the radicalism of the Sixties — but again in an infantile way . Speakers were shouted down to prove social-justice fides . “ Studies ” courses squeezed out philosophy and Latin . History became a melodramatic game of finding sinners and saints , rather than shared tragedy . Standards fell to accommodate poorly prepared incoming students , on the logic that old norms were arbitrary and discriminatory constructs anyway .
The curriculum now was recalibrated as therapeutic ; it no longer aimed to challenge students by demanding wide reading , composition skills , and mastery of the inductive method . The net result was the worst of all possible worlds : An entire generation of students left college with record debt , mostly ignorant of the skills necessary to read , write , and argue effectively , lacking a general body of shared knowledge — and angry . They were often arrogant in their determination to actualize the ideologies of their professors in the real world . A generation ignorant , arrogant , and poor is a prescription for social volatility .
Frustration and failure were inevitable , more so when marriage and home-owning in a stagnant economy were now encumbered by $ 1 trillion in student loans . New conventional wisdom recalibrated the nuclear family and suburban life as the font of collective unhappiness . The result was the rise of the stereotypical single 28-year-old — furious at an unfair world that did not appreciate his unique sociology or environmental-studies major , stuck in his parents ’ basement or garage , working enough at low-paying jobs to pay for entertainments , if his room , board , and car were subsidized by his aging and retired parents .
Immigration was recalibrated hand-in-glove by progressives who wanted a new demographic to vote for leftist politicians and by Chamber of Commerce conservatives who wished an unlimited pool of cheap unskilled labor . The result was waves of illegal , non-diverse immigrants who arrived at precisely the moment when the old melting pot was under cultural assault .
The old black–white dichotomy in the United States was being recalibrated as “ diversity , ” or in racialist terms as a coalition now loosely and often grossly inexactly framed as non-white versus the ( supposedly shrinking ) white majority . Compensatory politics redefined illegal immigration once it was clear that not just a few million but perhaps one day 20 million potential new voters would remake the Electoral College . Difference was now no longer a transitory prelude to assimilation but a desirable permanent and separatist tribalism , even as it became harder to define exactly what ethnic and racial difference really was in an increasingly intermarried society . We soon went from the buffoonery of a wannabe Native American Ward Churchill to the psychodrama of an Islamist , anti-Semitic Linda Sarsour .
We forget especially the role of Barack Obama . He ran as a Biden Democrat renouncing gay marriage , saying , “ I believe marriage is between a man and a woman . I am not in favor of gay marriage. ” Then he “ evolved ” on the question and created a climate in which to agree with this position could get one fired . He promised to close the border and reduce illegal immigration : “ We will try to do more to speed the deportation of illegal aliens who are arrested for crimes , to better identify illegal aliens in the workplace . We are a nation of immigrants . But we are also a nation of laws. ” Then he institutionalized the idea that to agree with that now-abandoned agenda was a career-ender .
Obama weaponized the IRS , the FBI , the NSC , the CIA , and the State Department and redefined the deep state as if it were the Congress , but with the ability to make and enforce laws all at once .
Obama vowed to “ work across the aisle ” and was elected on the impression that he was a “ bridge builder ” who would heal racial animosity , restore U.S. prestige abroad , and reignite the economy after the September 2008 meltdown . Instead , he weaponized the IRS , the FBI , the NSC , the CIA , and the State Department and redefined the deep state as if it were the Congress , but with the ability to make and enforce laws all at once . “ Hope and Change ” became “ You didn ’ t build that ! ”
President Obama , especially in his second term , soon renounced much of what he had run on . He raised taxes , stagnated what would have been a natural recovery , weighed in on hot-button racialized criminal cases , advanced a radical social agenda , and polarized the country along lines of difference .
Again , Obama most unfortunately redefined race as a white-versus-nonwhite binary , in an attempt to build a new coalition of progressives , on the unspoken assumption that the clingers were destined to slow irrelevance and with them their retrograde and obstructionist ideas . In other words , the Left could win most presidential elections of the future , as Obama did , by writing off the interior and hyping identity politics on the two coasts .
The Obama administration hinged on leveraging these sociocultural , political , and economic schisms even further . The split pitted constitutionalism and American exceptionalism and tradition on the one side versus globalist ecumenicalism and citizenry of the world on the other . Of course , older divides — big government , high taxes , redistributionist social-welfare schemes , and mandated equality of result versus limited government , low taxes , free-market individualism , and equality of opportunity — were replayed , but sharpened in these new racial , cultural , and economic landscapes .
A steady 3 to 4 percent growth in annual GDP would trim a lot of cultural rhetoric . Four percent unemployment will make more Americans valuable and give them advantages with employers . Measured , meritocratic , diverse , and legal immigration would help to restore the melting pot .
Reforming the university would help too , mostly by abolishing tenure , requiring an exit competence exam for the BA degree ( a sort of reverse , back-end SAT or ACT exam ) , and ending government-subsidized student loans that promote campus fiscal irresponsibility and a curriculum that ensures future unemployment for too many students .
We need to develop a new racial sense that we are so intermarried and assimilated that cardboard racial cutouts are irrelevant .
Religious and spiritual reawakening is crucial . The masters of the universe of Silicon Valley did not , as promised , bring us new-age tranquility , but rather only greater speed and intensity to do what we always do . Trolling , doxing , and phishing were just new versions of what Jesus warned about in the Sermon on the Mount . Spiritual transcendence is the timeless water of life ; technology is simply the delivery pump . We confused the two . That water can be delivered ever more rapidly does not mean it ever changes its essence . High tech has become the great delusion .
Finally , we need to develop a new racial sense that we are so intermarried and assimilated that cardboard racial cutouts are irrelevant . Our new racialism must be seen as a reactionary and dangerous return to 19th-century norm of judging our appearance on the outside as more valuable than who we are on the inside .
Whether we all take a deep breath , and understand our present dangerous trajectory , will determine whether 2019 becomes 1861 .","A Trump supporter holds an American flag at a rally in Madison, Ala., February 2016. (Marvin Gentry/Reuters)

The mass production of cheap consumer goods, most assembled abroad, redefined wealth or, rather, disguised poverty. Suddenly the lower middle classes and the poor had in their palms the telecommunications power of the Pentagon of the 1970s, the computing force of IBM in the 1980s, and the entertainment diversity of the rich of the 1990s.

But if campus materialism was at odds with classroom socialism, few seemed to notice. Instead, the idea grew up that one had no need to follow concretely the consequences of his abstract ideology. Or even worse, one’s hard-left politics — the louder and more strident the better — became a psychological means of squaring the circle of denouncing the West while being affluent and enjoying the material comforts of the good life.

Universities grew not just increasingly left-wing but far more intolerant than they were during the radicalism of the Sixties — but again in an infantile way. Speakers were shouted down to prove social-justice fides. “Studies” courses squeezed out philosophy and Latin. History became a melodramatic game of finding sinners and saints, rather than shared tragedy. Standards fell to accommodate poorly prepared incoming students, on the logic that old norms were arbitrary and discriminatory constructs anyway.

The curriculum now was recalibrated as therapeutic; it no longer aimed to challenge students by demanding wide reading, composition skills, and mastery of the inductive method. The net result was the worst of all possible worlds: An entire generation of students left college with record debt, mostly ignorant of the skills necessary to read, write, and argue effectively, lacking a general body of shared knowledge — and angry. They were often arrogant in their determination to actualize the ideologies of their professors in the real world. A generation ignorant, arrogant, and poor is a prescription for social volatility.

Frustration and failure were inevitable, more so when marriage and home-owning in a stagnant economy were now encumbered by $1 trillion in student loans. New conventional wisdom recalibrated the nuclear family and suburban life as the font of collective unhappiness. The result was the rise of the stereotypical single 28-year-old — furious at an unfair world that did not appreciate his unique sociology or environmental-studies major, stuck in his parents’ basement or garage, working enough at low-paying jobs to pay for entertainments, if his room, board, and car were subsidized by his aging and retired parents.

Illegal Immigration

Immigration was recalibrated hand-in-glove by progressives who wanted a new demographic to vote for leftist politicians and by Chamber of Commerce conservatives who wished an unlimited pool of cheap unskilled labor. The result was waves of illegal, non-diverse immigrants who arrived at precisely the moment when the old melting pot was under cultural assault.

The old black–white dichotomy in the United States was being recalibrated as “diversity,” or in racialist terms as a coalition now loosely and often grossly inexactly framed as non-white versus the (supposedly shrinking) white majority. Compensatory politics redefined illegal immigration once it was clear that not just a few million but perhaps one day 20 million potential new voters would remake the Electoral College. Difference was now no longer a transitory prelude to assimilation but a desirable permanent and separatist tribalism, even as it became harder to define exactly what ethnic and racial difference really was in an increasingly intermarried society. We soon went from the buffoonery of a wannabe Native American Ward Churchill to the psychodrama of an Islamist, anti-Semitic Linda Sarsour.

The Obama Project

We forget especially the role of Barack Obama. He ran as a Biden Democrat renouncing gay marriage, saying, “I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage.” Then he “evolved” on the question and created a climate in which to agree with this position could get one fired. He promised to close the border and reduce illegal immigration: “We will try to do more to speed the deportation of illegal aliens who are arrested for crimes, to better identify illegal aliens in the workplace. We are a nation of immigrants. But we are also a nation of laws.” Then he institutionalized the idea that to agree with that now-abandoned agenda was a career-ender.

Obama weaponized the IRS, the FBI, the NSC, the CIA, and the State Department and redefined the deep state as if it were the Congress, but with the ability to make and enforce laws all at once.

Obama vowed to “work across the aisle” and was elected on the impression that he was a “bridge builder” who would heal racial animosity, restore U.S. prestige abroad, and reignite the economy after the September 2008 meltdown. Instead, he weaponized the IRS, the FBI, the NSC, the CIA, and the State Department and redefined the deep state as if it were the Congress, but with the ability to make and enforce laws all at once. “Hope and Change” became “You didn’t build that!”

President Obama, especially in his second term, soon renounced much of what he had run on. He raised taxes, stagnated what would have been a natural recovery, weighed in on hot-button racialized criminal cases, advanced a radical social agenda, and polarized the country along lines of difference.

Again, Obama most unfortunately redefined race as a white-versus-nonwhite binary, in an attempt to build a new coalition of progressives, on the unspoken assumption that the clingers were destined to slow irrelevance and with them their retrograde and obstructionist ideas. In other words, the Left could win most presidential elections of the future, as Obama did, by writing off the interior and hyping identity politics on the two coasts.

The Obama administration hinged on leveraging these sociocultural, political, and economic schisms even further. The split pitted constitutionalism and American exceptionalism and tradition on the one side versus globalist ecumenicalism and citizenry of the world on the other. Of course, older divides — big government, high taxes, redistributionist social-welfare schemes, and mandated equality of result versus limited government, low taxes, free-market individualism, and equality of opportunity — were replayed, but sharpened in these new racial, cultural, and economic landscapes.

What Might Bring the United States Together Again?

A steady 3 to 4 percent growth in annual GDP would trim a lot of cultural rhetoric. Four percent unemployment will make more Americans valuable and give them advantages with employers. Measured, meritocratic, diverse, and legal immigration would help to restore the melting pot.

Reforming the university would help too, mostly by abolishing tenure, requiring an exit competence exam for the BA degree (a sort of reverse, back-end SAT or ACT exam), and ending government-subsidized student loans that promote campus fiscal irresponsibility and a curriculum that ensures future unemployment for too many students.

We need to develop a new racial sense that we are so intermarried and assimilated that cardboard racial cutouts are irrelevant.

Religious and spiritual reawakening is crucial. The masters of the universe of Silicon Valley did not, as promised, bring us new-age tranquility, but rather only greater speed and intensity to do what we always do. Trolling, doxing, and phishing were just new versions of what Jesus warned about in the Sermon on the Mount. Spiritual transcendence is the timeless water of life; technology is simply the delivery pump. We confused the two. That water can be delivered ever more rapidly does not mean it ever changes its essence. High tech has become the great delusion.

Finally, we need to develop a new racial sense that we are so intermarried and assimilated that cardboard racial cutouts are irrelevant. Our new racialism must be seen as a reactionary and dangerous return to 19th-century norm of judging our appearance on the outside as more valuable than who we are on the inside.

Whether we all take a deep breath, and understand our present dangerous trajectory, will determine whether 2019 becomes 1861.

Bret Schafer of the Alliance for Securing Democracy tracks activity of Russia-linked social media bots, trolls and influencers. He talks to Steve Inskeep about the topics those bots focus on.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

Russian bots apparently have opinions on the Parkland school shooting. By bots, we mean automated social media accounts linked to Russia, which federal investigators say were used to play up American divisions and promote President Trump's election in 2016. Now it seems that some bots weighed in on the divisive subject of mass shootings and gun control in the last few days. Bret Schafer is here in our studio. He tracks Russian disinformation at the Alliance for Securing Democracy, which was set up after the 2016 election.

Welcome to the program, sir.

BRET SCHAFER: Thank you. Good to be here.

INSKEEP: What are the Russians saying so far as you can tell?

SCHAFER: So we saw the same kind of activity after the Vegas shooting, actually. So it started with just conversations that Americans were having. So it was breaking news. That quickly shifted to the gun control debate that took sort of extreme positions on both sides. And by Day 3, they were moving into conspiracy theories.

INSKEEP: What do you mean by extreme positions and conspiracy theories?

SCHAFER: So extreme positions - they are choosing - well - both the left and right side of the gun control debate but really finding whatever exists in the American media that is far from the center. So these are not sort of rational opinions here. They're looking for the extreme points of view and pushing those.

INSKEEP: So if somebody says, hypothetically, the government staged this whole nightmare to take away our guns - which is a thing that has been said about mass shootings in the past...

SCHAFER: Right.

INSKEEP: ...These Russian accounts will go after that and promote that idea.

SCHAFER: We saw that. And we also saw that after Vegas. So one of our top hashtags that we saw trending online was actually #FalseFlag. And we see a lot of links to sites that promote these conspiracy theories. And again, it's the same thing we saw after Vegas and the Texas shooting last year.

INSKEEP: False flag operation, the phrase for this kind of conspiracy - this idea of a conspiracy.

What do the Russians want?

SCHAFER: Well, I think they want us fighting amongst each other. Senator Lankford - and I'm kind of paraphrasing here - said they're the kids on the schoolyard yelling fight, fight, fight, fight. So we're kind of practicing information warfare on ourselves right now unfortunately. And the Russians are just amplifying those voices on the extreme and stirring up trouble.

INSKEEP: Can I ask about a bit of a contrary opinion that's been put out in the last day or so by Masha Gessen? She is a writer for The New Yorker.

SCHAFER: Right.

INSKEEP: She is no fan of Vladimir Putin for certain. But she's skeptical that this Russian interference is as large as it seems to be or as we've played it up to be. She writes, the Kremlin and its media are tickled to be taken so seriously. Their sub-grammatical imitations of American political rhetoric - and a lot of it is kind of not very grammatical - their overtures to the most marginal of political players are suddenly at the very heart of American political life.

Are we overdoing our concerns about this?

SCHAFER: I think yes and no. There is a concern that we take this too seriously and maybe overcorrect in terms of heavy-handed regulation. And that's actually what the Russians did after the Snowden affair. They used that to push very sort of extreme restrictions on Internet freedom. So we clearly don't want to see that happen...

INSKEEP: The Stoneman affair, you said - what is that?

SCHAFER: The Snowden affair.

INSKEEP: The Snowden affair - I'm sorry. I didn't quite follow that. Oh, Edward Snowden - OK. Go on.

SCHAFER: Correct, correct. So there is that fear that we could maybe blow this out of proportion. At the same time, by pushing the voices on the extreme and making these fringe voices seem like one voice is 30,000 because they're amplified by bots, it's drowning out the sort of rational debate that should be happening at the center.

INSKEEP: In about 10 seconds, does it effectively counter Russia just for the public to know what is happening?

SCHAFER: That's tough to do in 10 seconds. No. But I think it's the first step, maybe, to finding out a way to solve this.

INSKEEP: OK. Mr. Schafer, thank you very much.

It is , simply , the death of civil discourse . U.S . Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley has been the most recent leader to address this societal problem .
Since her appointment , Ambassador Haley has become a conservative “ rock star ” for her stunning speeches on the UN floor . At an event at The Heritage Foundation this month , the Ambassador called the UN Human Rights Council , a council which currently includes egregious human rights violators Iran and the Congo , a “ cesspool of political bias. ” She has defended Israel—America ’ s main ally in the Middle East—countless times against its detractors in the UN .
Now Ambassador Haley is advising conservatives on their approach to debating and discussing ideas with those who may disagree . In a recent speech to a group of conservative high schoolers at the Turning Point USA conference at George Washington University , she commented on a recent trend by young people on social media : “ Raise your hand if you ’ ve ever posted anything online to quote-unquote ‘ own the libs. ’ ” For those not up-to-date with modern slang , in this context , to “ own ” someone is to render them unable to reasonably reply to a sarcastic statement or zinger .
Quite a few students raised their hands and a few cheered . The ambassador then explained her view of the tactic : “ I know that it ’ s fun and that it can feel good , but step back and think about what you ’ re accomplishing when you do this—are you persuading anyone ? Who are you persuading ? We ’ ve all been guilty of it at some point or another , but this kind of speech isn ’ t leadership—it ’ s the exact opposite. ” Instead , Ambassador Haley offered her own definition of leadership : “ Real leadership is about persuasion , it ’ s about movement , it ’ s bringing people around to your point of view . Not by shouting them down , but by showing them how it is in their best interest to see things the way you do . ”
Ambassador Haley ’ s words line up perfectly with what Scripture says ( which is not surprising , as she is a Christian ) . In the book of Proverbs , Solomon advises his son that “ A gentle answer turns away wrath. ” He then warns that the opposite , “ harsh words , ” only “ stir up anger ” ( Proverbs 15:1 ) . Peter writes to his readers that they should “ always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have ” and to “ do this with gentleness and respect ” ( 1 Peter 3:15 ) .
The fundamental issue here is how we conduct discourse . Disagreements should never become merely a platform for “ zingers ” in and of themselves . When one or both sides resort to name calling and/or mocking their opponent rather than using reason to persuade , nothing of any value is accomplished . For example , suppose a conservative ( or liberal ) posts a political statement on Facebook or another social media platform , and a commenter on the other side of the aisle replies nastily to the post . The original poster has three options : not replying , replying with the same amount of ire , or replying with the purpose of persuasion . If the poster replies with “ gentleness and respect , ” there is a good chance that their original argument will get a fair hearing . Obviously , civil discourse needs two participants , and the commenter may not comply , but Scripture demands that we at least try to respectfully persuade our opponents .
If our culture really is coming apart at the seams , as some commentators are bemoaning , then conservatives adding to the cacophony of empty rhetoric will certainly not aid in tamping down the culture war vitriol .

In some cases, the killers use their internet posts to praise previous attacks by other white nationalists. And after new assaults, the manifestos get passed around, feeding the cycle of propaganda and violence.

But identifying and stopping the extremists who plan to launch an attack is much easier said than done.

“The use of social media platforms by terrorist groups, domestic threats, foreign intelligence services, and criminal organizations to further their illegal activity creates a demonstrated need for tools to properly identify the activity and react appropriately,” the FBI said in its request.

PRESSURE

Top law enforcement and domestic security officials from the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand met with leading social media and internet companies in London last week, and pushed them to help authorities track suspicious users.

The government officials noted in an agenda paper for the meeting that some companies “deliberately design their systems in a way that precludes any form of access to content, even in cases of the most serious crimes.”

“Tech companies should include mechanisms in the design of their encrypted products and services whereby governments, acting with appropriate legal authority, can obtain access to data in a readable and usable format,” the agenda paper said.

A final statement from the meeting said little about encryption, however, and neither company nor government officials talked about what was discussed.

Facebook and Microsoft confirmed they attended but Google, which was invited, did not respond to a request for comment. Other attendees included Roblox, Snap and Twitter, the statement said.

FBI agents say that broad surveillance powers enacted by Congress in the wake of the Sept., 11, 2001 attacks helped them track international terrorist groups and stop people with links to foreign groups like al Qaeda and Islamic State before they could carry out crimes.

But they key law criminalizing “material support” for terrorism does not apply to investigations or prosecutions of domestic terrorists, such as violent white supremacists, that commit hate crimes.

This week, the FBI Agents Association called on Congress to make domestic terrorism a federal crime in order to give agents more tools.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation, which promotes internet civil liberties, said the sheer amount of users posting aggressive content online makes it almost impossible to identify and track the people who pose an actual threat.

“Even though it seems like there is another mass shooting every week, if you are looking at the number of mass shooters versus the total population, it’s still a tiny, tiny number which means this is still a very rare event,” said Jeremy Gillula, the group’s tech products director. “It’s like trying to predict where lightning is going to strike.”",www.reuters.com,center,m7Gwb2txCKbpWkWs

Why is it always foreigners who manage to unite all the politicians from both parties in Washington?

Illegal aliens — I mean “Dreamers.” Haitian boat people. Olde Europeans. Sudanese. And now the Kurds. It is never support for regular Americans that brings politicians from both parties together.

Even military veterans seem to offend half the politicians in Washington. Democrats in Congress would give illegal aliens free health care before they would give it to our wounded veterans.

And don’t get me wrong. I’ve got nothing against the Kurds. They seem like great people. Brave, hardworking — a considerable step up from your average American college student today. And they seem to be truly trying to shake off the yoke of tyranny, which at least half of Americans support.

But why do politicians drop everything they should be working on and come together to do something only for the “Dreamers,” who, again, are illegal aliens? Or for the Kurds?

Politico website, in an attempt at wry humor, posted a story Monday: “Trump unites the GOP — against him.”

Get it? So witty.

The story is about how President Trump wants to keep his campaign promise to disentangle us from all these foreign wars, including the civil war in Syria.

Nothing — and I mean NOTHING — unites politicians in Washington like some rogue renegade who gets elected and then vows to keep the promises that got him elected. It is why Mr. Trump is so deeply despised inside the swamp.

The “whistleblowers” in the deepest bowels of the swamp breed like mosquitoes carrying virulent diseases.

“The president’s decision to change course in Syria has united Republicans against him, and it threatens a new round of Congress-versus-the-administration griping with consequences on the global stage,” Politico displayed on its little website.

The electronic story went on to quote Democrats and Republicans drafting bipartisan legislation together — a feat they have not done for regular Americans in years. Probably more than a decade.

They cannot even get together and approve the USMCA trade agreement that everyone in Washington agrees upon and for which thousands of family farmers across the United States are desperate. The holdup is that Mr. Trump might (rightly) get credit for it.

One bill in support of the Kurds has so much support in Congress, politicians claim, that it will be “veto-proof.” Wow. Can you imagine Congress cobbling together that much support for anything to help regular Americans?

Another Republican declared: “We must always have the backs of our allies.”

Where is this unity when it comes to — I don’t know — our own soldiers?

Another Republican wagged his finger: “If the President sticks with this retreat, he needs to know that this bad decision will likely result in the slaughter of allies who fought with us, including women and children.”

I am sorry, but they did not fight alongside us. We fought alongside them.

This is not our war. It’s theirs. That is why it is called a “civil war.” And it is Syria’s civil war. Not ours.

CNN 's New York office was among those evacuated due to the discovery of an apparent explosive device . Law enforcement officers said the incidents appear related , and the devices appear to be pipe bombs . A law enforcement official directly involved in the investigation tells ███ that the devices have similar packaging , labelling and postage -- leading investigators to believe that one person or group is responsible .
In his first public remarks on the packages which largely targeted Democratic figures , President Trump said Wednesday afternoon that the devices are being inspected , `` and a major federal investigation is now underway . ''
`` We have to unify . We have to come together , '' Trump said , at a bill-signing for opioid legislation . `` Acts or threats of political violence of any kind have no place in the United States of America . ''
Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi issued a joint statement Wednesday afternoon saying that `` Trump 's words ring hollow until he reverses his statements that condone acts of violence .
`` Time and time again , the President has condoned physical violence and divided Americans with his words and his actions , '' said Schumer and Pelosi . `` [ E ] xpressing support for the Congressman [ Greg Gianforte ] who body-slammed a reporter , the neo-Nazis who killed a young woman in Charlottesville , his supporters at rallies who get violent with protestors , dictators around the world who murder their own citizens , and referring to the free press as the enemy of the people . ''
In the latest incident , a law enforcement source told ███ that U.S. Capitol Police are investigating a suspicious package addressed to Democratic California Rep. Maxine Waters . The package is at the Capitol Hill screening facility in Maryland .
The rapidly evolving security scare went public when the Secret Service confirmed Wednesday morning its officers had `` intercepted '' two suspicious packages identified as `` potential explosive devices '' sent to Obama and Clinton .
CNN employees , shortly afterward , were evacuated from their New York office , due to a suspicious package at the Time Warner Center reportedly addressed to ex-CIA director John Brennan ( who is an analyst for NBC ) . At a New York press conference , NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill said officers on the scene identified what `` appeared to be a live explosive device '' as well as an envelope containing white powder , which is now being investigated .
Meanwhile , the focus turned to Sunrise , Fla. as the building housing the office of Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz , D-Fla. , the former Democratic Party chairwoman , was evacuated over a suspicious package .
One source told ███ that all the packages in question had a return address affiliated with that location . The package discovered at Wasserman Schultz 's office , according to another law enforcement source , was originally sent to ex-Attorney General Eric Holder under the wrong address -- and then returned to Wasserman Schultz ' office due to the return label .
In a statement , Wasserman Schultz said she was `` deeply disturbed by the way my name was used . '' She added that a second office , in nearby Aventura , was evacuated `` in an abundance of caution . ''

These terrorizing acts are despicable , and anyone responsible will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law . The United States Secret Service and other law enforcement agencies are investigating and will take all appropriate actions to protect anyone threatened by these cowards , ” she said , joined by Trump and Vice President Pence , who at a separate event said those responsible will be `` brought to justice . ''
The news of the packages to Clinton and Obama unfolded quickly Wednesday morning . It first emerged that the FBI was investigating one suspicious package found by the home of Bill and Hillary Clinton in Chappaqua , New York . But in a statement , the Secret Service said after that package addressed to Hillary Clinton was caught late Tuesday , a second package addressed to Obama 's residence `` was intercepted by Secret Service personnel in Washington , DC '' on Wednesday morning .
`` The packages were immediately identified during routine mail screening procedures as potential explosive devices and were appropriately handled as such . The protectees did not receive the packages nor were they at risk of receiving them , '' the Secret Service said in its statement .
The Secret Service said it has launched a `` full scope criminal investigation that will leverage all available federal , state , and local resources to determine the source of the packages and identify those responsible . ”
Speaking at an event early Wednesday afternoon , Hillary Clinton said her family is fine and `` grateful '' for the work of the Secret Service which caught the package before it got to their home . She said this is a `` troubling time . ''
Sources told ███ that former President Bill Clinton was at home in Chappaqua when the suspicious package was found , but that it was screened in Westchester County -- not at the Clinton residence . A spokesperson for Hillary Clinton told ███ that the former secretary of state has been in Florida for the last several days .
“ I stand with all Americans in condemning today ’ s attempted acts of domestic terrorism . As we continue to learn more , Americans are united in gratitude for the first responders — the Secret Service , the Postal Service , and other law enforcement — who protect our leaders and public figures from such unconscionable acts , ” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , said .
In New York , the New Castle Police Department and the Westchester County Police are assisting in their investigation into the first suspicious package .
“ The matter is currently under federal investigation , ” a spokesman for the New Castle Police Department said in a statement to ███ .
The FBI 's New York Field Office tweeted Wednesday morning that the investigation is ongoing .
According to The New York Times , the explosive device in Chappaqua was found by a technician who screens mail for the Clintons . Chappaqua is approximately 20 minutes from Bedford . Both towns are about one hour outside of New York City .","Packages containing suspected explosive devices were intercepted en route to some of the most prominent political figures in the country – including former President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton – putting law enforcement on high alert Wednesday and prompting evacuations and sweeps of several facilities.

CNN's New York office was among those evacuated due to the discovery of an apparent explosive device. Law enforcement officers said the incidents appear related, and the devices appear to be pipe bombs. A law enforcement official directly involved in the investigation tells Fox News that the devices have similar packaging, labelling and postage -- leading investigators to believe that one person or group is responsible.

In his first public remarks on the packages which largely targeted Democratic figures, President Trump said Wednesday afternoon that the devices are being inspected, ""and a major federal investigation is now underway.""

""We have to unify. We have to come together,"" Trump said, at a bill-signing for opioid legislation. ""Acts or threats of political violence of any kind have no place in the United States of America.""

Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi issued a joint statement Wednesday afternoon saying that ""Trump's words ring hollow until he reverses his statements that condone acts of violence.

""Time and time again, the President has condoned physical violence and divided Americans with his words and his actions,"" said Schumer and Pelosi. ""[E]xpressing support for the Congressman [Greg Gianforte] who body-slammed a reporter, the neo-Nazis who killed a young woman in Charlottesville, his supporters at rallies who get violent with protestors, dictators around the world who murder their own citizens, and referring to the free press as the enemy of the people.""

In the latest incident, a law enforcement source told Fox News that U.S. Capitol Police are investigating a suspicious package addressed to Democratic California Rep. Maxine Waters. The package is at the Capitol Hill screening facility in Maryland.

The rapidly evolving security scare went public when the Secret Service confirmed Wednesday morning its officers had ""intercepted"" two suspicious packages identified as ""potential explosive devices"" sent to Obama and Clinton.

CNN employees, shortly afterward, were evacuated from their New York office, due to a suspicious package at the Time Warner Center reportedly addressed to ex-CIA director John Brennan (who is an analyst for NBC). At a New York press conference, NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill said officers on the scene identified what ""appeared to be a live explosive device"" as well as an envelope containing white powder, which is now being investigated.

Meanwhile, the focus turned to Sunrise, Fla. as the building housing the office of Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., the former Democratic Party chairwoman, was evacuated over a suspicious package.

One source told Fox News that all the packages in question had a return address affiliated with that location. The package discovered at Wasserman Schultz's office, according to another law enforcement source, was originally sent to ex-Attorney General Eric Holder under the wrong address -- and then returned to Wasserman Schultz' office due to the return label.

Sign up here .
President Trump , in an interview that aired Thursday morning with Fox Business Network 's Maria Bartiromo , said he believes his political critics want a slower reopening of the economy not due to the coronavirus threat , but to hurt him politically in the November election .
The president made those comments in the same interview where he said he disagrees with the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) , Dr. Anthony Fauci , on the measures needed to reopen schools .
When asked if he thinks his political opponents want him to keep the economy closed going into the presidential election , Trump said he does .
`` Yeah , I do . I do . I think it 's a political thing , '' Trump told Bartiromo .
When pushed on whether such a move would be putting money ahead of lives , Trump pushed back .
`` The people that want to see the right thing happen , they agree with me . We have to get our country open , '' Trump said . `` You know , if it was up to some people let 's keep it closed for a long time ... and watch the United States go down the tubes . Not gon na happen . Never gon na happen on my watch . ''
Also in the interview , Trump made comments criticizing Fauci on his testimony about reopening schools during a hearing with the Senate Health Committee . Fauci earlier this week did not necessarily weigh in on whether schools should open , but said it 's unlikely a vaccine would be ready in time for the school year .
“ So [ Dr. ] Anthony [ Fauci ] is a good person , a very good person – I 've disagreed with him , ” Trump said . “ We have to get the schools open , we have to get our country open , we have to open our country . Now we want to do it safely , but we also want to do it as quickly as possible , we ca n't keep going on like this … You 're having bedlam already in the streets , you ca n't do this . We have to get it open . I totally disagree with him on schools . ”
Earlier this week , the White House touted the United States ' progress on coronavirus testing , which is a major benchmark many experts and governors have said is necessary to hit before moving to lift stay-at-home orders and business closures .
Trump also noted in the interview that young people tend not to get as sick because of the coronavirus and have lower death rates .
`` I think we have to open our schools , young people are very little affected by this , '' he said .
But that is a point , when made by Sen. Rand Paul , R-Ky. , in the Tuesday Senate hearing , that Fauci expressed concerns about .
`` We should be humble about what we do n't know , '' Fauci told Paul . `` And I think that falls under the fact that we do n't know everything about this virus , and we really got to be very careful , particularly when it comes to children . Because the more and more we learn , we 're seeing things about what this virus can do that we did n't see from the studies in China or in Europe . ''
Trump also noted in the Wednesday morning interview that Fauci has supported his earlier move to restrict travel from China in the earlier stages of the coronavirus outbreak .

`` He said I saved hundreds of thousands of lives , which is what happened , '' Trump said . `` Everybody disagreed when I did that . ''
Trump also hit the Chinese government , which knew about the coronavirus outbreak when it signed a trade deal with Trump in January . `` I 'm very disappointed in China , I will tell you , right now , '' Trump said .
The president has been pushing to reopen the economy as quickly as possible , emphasizing the harmful economic effects of keeping businesses closed and people out of work , despite pushback from critics that he is essentially sacrificing lives to the economy .

`` We have to open our country , we have no choice . You know people are dying this way too ... they 're dying of this closure ... where they 're in their house or their apartment ... they 're not allowed to go out , '' Trump said .

`` As I have said many times publicly , what we have worked out is a guideline framework for how to open America again , ” Fauci said . In order to proceed to the first of three stages in the reopening guidelines , states would need to see an uninterrupted decrease in coronavirus cases over a 14-day period .

It is safe to say the debate has not gone well for the Obama administration :
This , in somewhat exaggerated form , is how the public debate has played out through the seven years of the Obama presidency . The conservative opposition has been apoplectic , and liberal supporters disappointed . The left has focused far more attention on holding the administration ’ s feet to the fire and guarding against complacency than advocating for ( and celebrating ) its achievements . And the right has maintained a wall of totalistic opposition that can not be cracked by any amount of real-world developments .
Here is one of the oddities of the last seven years . Barack Obama won a clear majority in both his election and his reelection , fulfilled most of his policy goals as president , is presiding over a solid economic recovery , and has avoided any real scandal ( i.e. , one that exists outside the opposition fever swamps ) . Yet his approval ratings have consistently trailed his vote percentages . More than half of the electorate voted for him twice , but well under half approves of his job performance . Despite the fact that he accomplished what he said he would , Obama quickly lost a chunk of the public that voted for him , and has never won them back .
In large part this represents negative polarization , the dominant political force of our time . Negative polarization is a phenomenon defined by political scientists Alan Abramowitz and Steven Webster . It means that the public has sorted itself into hardened political camps with firm voting habits , but these loyalties are based more on antipathy for the opposing party than affirmative support for one ’ s own side . Indeed , a growing share of voters describes itself as “ independent ” even as its behavior shows that it is more , not less , consistent in its support for a single party . In a negative-polarization world , many of Obama ’ s supporters will express dissatisfaction with his job performance but vote for him and his party anyway , because they loathe the Republicans so much . The same phenomenon would likely hold true in reverse if a Republican held office . ( It may have : George W. Bush ’ s approval ratings rose in the run-up to the 2004 election , and then fell back , as his supporters went from assessing his performance in a vacuum to comparing him to the loathsome , cheesesteak-bungling Frenchie John Kerry . )
But I wonder whether the tone of the Obama-era debate has contributed as well . Most major Obama-era policy debates have resulted in a mix of right-wing apocalyptic rage and liberal dismay . The stimulus was too small , Obamacare lacked a public option , Dodd-Frank failed to break up the big banks , and on and on . When the public that barely follows the debate hears that one side considers Obama ’ s bill the destruction of freedom in America , and the other side considers it a disappointing compromise , the impression that comes off is not positive . None of this is to say that the left has an obligation to support the administration or hold back its criticisms , only that guarding against complacency has costs of its own . In the light of history , the Obama administration is likely to be seen as a triumph . The sour perspective maintained by his supporters in his own time will be forgotten — or , if and when it is revisited , it will seem very weird .","What does it take to please you people?

The New York Times’ “Room for Debate” column today debates “the defining aspects of Obama’s legacy.” Six writers contributed to the discussion. It is safe to say the debate has not gone well for the Obama administration:

This, in somewhat exaggerated form, is how the public debate has played out through the seven years of the Obama presidency. The conservative opposition has been apoplectic, and liberal supporters disappointed. The left has focused far more attention on holding the administration’s feet to the fire and guarding against complacency than advocating for (and celebrating) its achievements. And the right has maintained a wall of totalistic opposition that cannot be cracked by any amount of real-world developments.

Barack Obama won a clear majority in both his election and his reelection, fulfilled most of his policy goals as president, is presiding over a solid economic recovery, and has avoided any real scandal (i.e., one that exists outside the opposition fever swamps). Yet his approval ratings have consistently trailed his vote percentages. More than half of the electorate voted for him twice, but well under half approves of his job performance. Despite the fact that he accomplished what he said he would, Obama quickly lost a chunk of the public that voted for him, and has never won them back.

In large part this represents negative polarization, the dominant political force of our time. Negative polarization is a phenomenon defined by political scientists Alan Abramowitz and Steven Webster. It means that the public has sorted itself into hardened political camps with firm voting habits, but these loyalties are based more on antipathy for the opposing party than affirmative support for one’s own side. Indeed, a growing share of voters describes itself as “independent” even as its behavior shows that it is more, not less, consistent in its support for a single party. In a negative-polarization world, many of Obama’s supporters will express dissatisfaction with his job performance but vote for him and his party anyway, because they loathe the Republicans so much. The same phenomenon would likely hold true in reverse if a Republican held office. (It may have: George W. Bush’s approval ratings rose in the run-up to the 2004 election, and then fell back, as his supporters went from assessing his performance in a vacuum to comparing him to the loathsome, cheesesteak-bungling Frenchie John Kerry.)

But I wonder whether the tone of the Obama-era debate has contributed as well. Most major Obama-era policy debates have resulted in a mix of right-wing apocalyptic rage and liberal dismay. The stimulus was too small, Obamacare lacked a public option, Dodd-Frank failed to break up the big banks, and on and on. When the public that barely follows the debate hears that one side considers Obama’s bill the destruction of freedom in America, and the other side considers it a disappointing compromise, the impression that comes off is not positive. None of this is to say that the left has an obligation to support the administration or hold back its criticisms, only that guarding against complacency has costs of its own. In the light of history, the Obama administration is likely to be seen as a triumph. The sour perspective maintained by his supporters in his own time will be forgotten — or, if and when it is revisited, it will seem very weird.",www.nymag.com,left,9bG6zaMicHeTtaBE

Minor used a survey pool of 7,000 pre-screened individuals across the country that were obtained by Northwestern University ’ s Kellogg School of Management .

The next three questions added party affiliation into the mix for most players .

In the game , Player A could keep $ 5 and give $ 5 to Player B , or pass the decision to Player B , who then could choose to give $ 10 to each player or keep $ 14 and give nothing to Player A .

They then were asked to guess what percentage of the group they were paired with ( Republicans or Democrats ) would prove trustworthy . If they guessed the correct decile , they were given an additional $ 3 .
The results : Democrats trusted other Democrats 63 percent of the time ( by passing the decision ) and trusted Republicans 40 percent of the time . Republicans trusted other Republicans 58 percent of the time and trusted Democrats 66 percent of the time .

Predictions of how trustworthy Player B would prove to be were similar – 63 percent of Republicans believed their partner would be trustworthy while Democrats predicted 62 percent would . Both wildly underestimated . The actual reciprocation rate of Player B was 93 percent for Republicans and 85 percent for Democrats .
Minor and Hernandez then did another treatment to try to manipulate participants ’ beliefs .

IN BELIEF WE TRUST

Minor says the overarching issue is what leads people to trust one group over another, which has implications for business as well as the political arena.

Counter to previous studies, his team’s results indicated that a particular group that participants belonged to was less important than how trustworthy they thought the other group was.

TRUST IN THE WORKPLACE

The unduly pessimistic predictions in the political survey sparked Minor’s curiosity about whether the same disconnect exists in business transactions. A manager isn’t going to delegate a task if he or she doesn’t trust the subordinate to get the job done.

“If those beliefs are that far off in other kinds of settings, then actually that means there are some gross inefficiencies where transactions or relationships are not being consummated because of an erroneous level of trust that is not founded on the data,” Minor says.
